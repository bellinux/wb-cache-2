The article analyses how legal norms and practices instantiate and reiterate, rather than transform, existing hierarchical gender relations.

The paper explores the shortcomings of this approach and suggests possible solutions. Two promising alternatives are worth investigating.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to offer a different way of seeing and understanding defences in international criminal law. By contrast to the standard texts on defences which identify what the law is - and in some few cases to suggest what it should be - this work seeks to understand why the law is the way it is, and in doing so, reveal the gender biases that international criminal law defences conceal. International criminal law evolved out of a need to respond to gross wrongdoings that amounted to <b>international</b> <b>offences</b> perpetrated during conflict. The paradox is that conflict is about the 'legalised' use of violence by men and it is through this process that all too often women, subsumed within the category of civilians, become the direct and indirect victims of that violence. From its inception international criminal law has primarily addressed wrongs committed in conflict - but as perceived and defined by men. Moreover, because war crimes trials have always been about selective narratives that are controlled by the most powerful, women's voices have consistently been excluded. This study questions whether, as with offences, defences have evolved in such a way as to prefer the interests of the male soldier over the civilian and thereby foster a gendered view of defences in international criminal law. This work has been guided by some of the more recent theoretical debates that have engaged the scholarly community on the domestic level that challenges the traditional explanations of defences and that exposes the law to be fundamentally incoherent and characterised by bias. It offers an alternative perspective on defences in international criminal law that seeks to understand the interests that legal defences serve to protect. This thesis concludes that defences play a vital function in regulating relations between individuals and between the state and citizens by articulating the responsibilities of the different participants in a social grouping. Defences provide a powerful means through which the law delineates a society's moral boundaries and an effective mechanism through which specific normative values of liberal states are conveyed. The overriding {{objective of}} this study is to emphasise the need to take greater account of the inherent gender bias that continues to characterise the law in the process of judging the defendant who is charged with serious violations of international law perpetrated in a conflict...|$|R

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis explores {{a range of}} issues within the development of the offence of incitement to genocide. It examines how the 'notorious Jew-baiter' Julius Streicher, was prosecuted in 1945 / 46 before the International Military Tribunal (IMT) for 'the incitement of the persecution of the Jews'. The newly defined category of 'crimes against humanity' under Article 6 (c) of the Nuremberg Charter, classified 'persecutions on political, racial, or religious grounds' as a new criminal offence. In 1945, the prosecution alleged that Streicher's anti­Semitic propaganda had paved the way for Hitler's extermination policy, leading to the mass murder of approximately six million Jews. On October I, 1946, the Tribunal held that Streicher's actions of 'incitement to murder and extermination' were classified as 'persecution' and found him guilty of crimes against humanity. This thesis asks the question how was it that 'words used as persecution' became recognised as an <b>international</b> criminal <b>offence</b> as a sub set of crimes against humanity, without being directly or expressly criminalised by the Charter? In order to provide an answer to this question, this thesis conducts the first in-depth analysis and comprehensive reconstruction of how the prosecution's case against Streicher developed during the various phases of the pre-trial and trial process. This detailed reconstruction, based on archival sources not previously discussed in the academic literature on Nuremberg, forms the most original element of the thesis. The present study critically examines the factual evidence raised and dropped during different stages in the development of Streicher' s case. It explores the various strategies and tactics deployed by the prosecution, and evaluates the success and weaknesses, along with the counterarguments submitted by Streicher' s defence counsel. The aim in explicating and discussing these issues and conflicts of strategic interpretations and reinterpretations is to provide an original perspective that effectively explores the process 'behind the scenes'. This study suggests that it was this process of selective interpretation and decision-making that resulted in the emergence, or 'birth', of a new offence, 'incitement to genocide' that today would be recognised as 'direct and public incitement to commit genocide', under Article III(c) of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{criminalisation}} in international law of violations of international humanitarian law committed in internal armed conflict. The ICTY Appeals Chamber Decision on Jurisdiction in the Tadic case is analysed. The Decision confirms the customary development {{of the law of}} war crimes to include the criminality in <b>international</b> law of <b>offences</b> committed in internal armed conflict. Thus the emphasis is on proceedings before the Ad Hoc International Tribunals. The thesis describes the customary development of the law of war crimes by highlighting the method employed by Judges and the Prosecutor to allow for the maximum reach of the law. A major limitation they have encountered is that, though offences in internal conflict now entail individual criminal responsibility in international law, the disparate treatment of violations in internal conflicts versus violations in international conflicts has not been superseded. This treatment has consequences for the elements of the definition of war crimes: the character of the conflict remains an element of the crime even though it is indifferent to moral fault. In this connection, the strategies employed by the Prosecutor to avoid engaging in contentious and lengthy conflict classification are reviewed. The disparate treatment of violations in internal and international conflicts is traced to the 'two-box' approach to international humanitarian law, which in turn stems from states' choice to be less restricted in their conduct in an internal armed conflict than they would be in an international conflict. This work recognises the limits posed by the law as it stands today: the recurrent theme throughout the thesis is the paramount importance of the principle of non retroactive application of criminal law...|$|R

40|$|CRIMINAL JURISDICTION This thesis {{deals with}} the {{criminal}} jurisdiction of states. Legal examinations of the topic have been somewhat fragmentary in the Nordic legal community. The focus has rather been on certain sets of problems than comprehensive systematization. This {{can be seen in}} contrast to legal doctrine, especially in Germany. As the thesis deals with construction and systematization, it has a clear legal dogmatic character. However, the analysis is not directed at a particular country s legal system, but rather at criminal jurisdiction as a general legal phenomenon. This also requires elements of legal comparison. The comparative method used can be characterized as functional comparison, with the Finnish, Swedish, Danish and German legal systems to the fore. Chapter 2 analyses criminal jurisdiction in a broader legal context. In order to get a comprehensive picture of criminal jurisdiction, one must take into consideration the interplay between questions of jurisdiction and questions that relate to other legal areas with an international character. The concept of international criminal law is often used to indicate the totality of norms that regulate a state s criminal jurisdiction. However, this can be considered misleading. Rather, it is warranted to use the concept of international criminal law as an unspecified collective term for norms that have a certain functional relationship. Given this understanding of the concept, one can generally distinguish four separate areas: the law of criminal jurisdiction, international legal assistance in criminal matters, supranational, including European, criminal law, and <b>international</b> <b>offences.</b> When examining the collective term international criminal law, one must consider the numerous points of contact between these separate areas and, indeed, places where they overlap. The meaning of criminal jurisdiction is examined in chapter 3. The purpose is to provide a structure and an understanding of the scope and legal implications of the law of criminal jurisdiction. The concept of jurisdiction usually refers to the exercise of state power in some form. This exercise of power can refer to the relationship between states and individuals as well as the relationship between states. Consequently, the law of criminal jurisdiction has a national as well as an international dimension and there is a continuous process of interaction between these dimensions. The law of criminal jurisdiction also has a dual legal character. The law of jurisdiction has a material as well as a procedural side. The concepts used to indicate these components are penal authority and judicial authority. Penal authority refers to the state s claim on criminal appraisal of certain determined circumstances. Judicial authority, on the other hand, refers to the state s claim on realizing its penal authority. As long as national courts only apply national criminal law, the scope of a state s penal authority {{is the same as the}} scope of the application of its criminal law. By legislating on the scope of the application of national criminal law, the state, consequently, also establishes its penal authority. In order to understand the law of criminal jurisdiction, one must distinguish between these components. The question of how states legislate on matters of criminal jurisdiction is also examined. This leads to the question of the dogmatic position of the norms on jurisdiction as well as the question of the so-called factors of the scope of application encompassed in these norms. Legal doctrine is divided on these issues, and the thesis strives for a more thorough analysis of them. How one answers these questions has a direct implication for a set of other questions of criminal law, including the principle of legality, the principle of guilt as well as criminal intent and mistake. Chapter 4 analyses the bounds of criminal jurisdiction, primarily with regard to limitations stemming from international law. States usually claim jurisdiction not only with regard to offences committed within their own state borders, but also with regard to offences committed abroad. According to the opinion presented in the thesis, the limitations must be sought in the principle of nonintervention and the doctrine of meaningful connection stemming from this principle, both found in international law. The international principle of the sovereign equality of states entails a demand for states to respect each other s internal affairs. Sovereignty in a material sense encompasses a state s self-determination over its own internal affairs. These affairs also include a state s criminal policy. In a positive respect, the demand for states to respect each other s sovereignty gives states the right to determine their own internal affairs. In a negative respect, there also follows a prohibition not to intervene in the internal affairs of other states (the principle of nonintervention). Any interference with another state s right to self-determination has to be justified by reference to a meaningful connection that expresses an acceptable interest between the extraterritorial circumstance and the state that makes use of its power of criminal regulation. Generally, one can presuppose that the so-called principles of jurisdiction express such meaningful connections. In order to render it possible to examine these principles, one must make a distinction between national principles of jurisdiction and international principles of jurisdiction. National principles are the results of attempts to identify and systematize overall elements in the national rules on jurisdiction. Therefore, they have a descriptive function. On the other hand, the function of international principles is to establish constituently which connections the national legislator may refer to when extending the state s penal authority. Therefore, they also have a normative function. In the course of their development, international principles have become detached from national principles and have acquired an independent meaning as norms of permission in international law. They are based on and form typical examples of balancing a state s self-determination and the principle of nonintervention. As such, they facilitate the need of national legislators and judiciaries to conduct a new exercise in balancing these two interests in every single case. The scope and meaning of the individual principles of jurisdiction are also examined. Additionally, I also analyze certain other aspects of importance for the scope of the law on criminal jurisdiction, such as international immunity and international jurisdictional obligations. Chapter 5 focuses on a particular problem complex in relation to the law on criminal jurisdiction, namely, the question of overlapping jurisdiction and conflicts of jurisdiction. First of all, the state s unilateral regulation on jurisdiction inevitably brings about a situation in which the law on jurisdiction in several states can cover the same act. Secondly, international conventions and EU legal acts also result in jurisdictional networks that give states overlapping jurisdictional competence. The problem has been discussed intensively with regard to EU member states, which are presupposed to practice a close legal cooperation based on trust. The focus is, therefore, on conflicts of jurisdiction between EU member states. Conflicts of jurisdiction can have negative consequences for a state s measures regarding criminal procedure as well as for individuals that are thereby affected. Consequently, the question arises as to what degree it is possible to prevent and solve conflicts of jurisdiction. Different models and legal mechanisms exist for this purpose, and these are examined more closely. An appropriate model for the solving of conflicts requires above all a sufficient level of transparency and predictability. Kapitel 1 i Finlands strafflag handlar om straffrättens tillämpningsområde. Detta tillämpningsområde betecknas även som Finlands straffrättsliga jurisdiktion. Denna jurisdiktion gäller inte enbart för brott som begås på det finska statsterritoriet. I likhet med andra länder har Finland under vissa omständigheter utsträckt sin jurisdiktion också till brott som begås utomlands. Denna avhandling handlar om staters straffrättsliga jurisdiktion. Jurisdiktion är emellertid inte ett entydigt begrepp utan kan tillskrivas olika betydelser och funktioner. Vad avses egentligen då man säger att ett brott omfattas av statens straffrättsliga jurisdiktion? Och under vilka omständigheter har stater rätt att hävda straffrättslig jurisdiktion? Analysen riktar sig till straffrättslig jurisdiktion som ett övergripande rättsligt fenomen. Syftet är att skapa en koherent och brukbar struktur för förståelsen av den straffrättsliga jurisdiktionsrättens omfång och rättsliga implikationer. Både staternas unilaterala jurisdiktionsreglering, internationella konventioner och EU-rättsliga instrument skapar även överlappande jurisdiktionskompetens mellan stater. Jurisdiktionskonflikter kan ha negativa konsekvenser för både stater och berörda individer. Således uppstår frågan om i vilken grad det är möjligt att förebygga och lösa dessa konflikter. För dessa syften existerar olika modeller och rättsliga mekanismer, vilka analyseras närmare. I granskningen reflekteras den straffrättsliga jurisdiktionsrätten även mot andra rättsområden med en internationell karaktär, såsom internationell rättslig hjälp i brottmål, europeisk straffrätt och folkrätt. Syftet är att klargöra det rättsliga sammanhanget och samspelet mellan dessa rättsområden...|$|R
