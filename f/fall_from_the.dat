5|$|Cirrus clouds often produce hair-like filaments—similar to the virga {{produced}} in liquid–water clouds—called fall streaks, {{and they are}} made of heavier ice crystals that <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cloud.

Gratus is thrown from his spooked horse and nearly killed. Although Messala knows this was an accident, he condemns Judah to the galleys and imprisons Miriam and Tirzah. By punishing a known friend and prominent citizen, he hopes to intimidate the Jewish populace. Judah swears to take revenge.|$|E
5|$|Labradors are {{powerful}} and indefatigable swimmers noted {{for their ability}} to tolerate the coldest of water for extended periods of time.

5|$|Lost Luggage is {{an action}} {{game in which}} the player {{controls}} skycap porters who are attempting to collect falling luggage from a wildly unpredictable baggage carousel. The objective is to collect all the suitcases that <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> carousel before they hit the ground. The player starts with three suitcases, which act as lives, and whenever a suitcase hits the floor, the player loses one. If all of the player's suitcases are lost, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|Many {{theories}} have been advanced {{in way of}} explanation for decline of the Roman Empire, and many dates given for its <b>fall,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> onset of its decline in the 3rd century to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Militarily, however, the Empire finally fell after first being overrun by various non-Roman peoples and then having its heart in Italy seized by Germanic troops in a revolt. The historicity and exact dates are uncertain, and some historians do not consider that the Empire fell at this point.|$|E
5|$|On 19 September he {{attacked}} a Rumpler C.IV which he {{drove down to}} 1,000 feet and saw camera and photographic plates <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> machine as it took violent evasive action. He abandoned the chase and spotted another. This time {{he attacked}} {{from the sun and}} from behind and below. His Lewis gun stopped after one round but his Vickers fired 60 rounds and the Rumpler crashed behind enemy lines. Other pilots and gunners on the line confirmed the kill. A DFW C.V followed on 23 September—his 13th victory.|$|E

5|$|Th1rt3en debuted {{at number}} 11 on the Billboard 200, selling 42,000 copies in the United States {{in its first}} week. This was a slight <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first-week sales (about 45,000 copies) and chart {{position}} (number 9) of its predecessor, Endgame. Another 10,780 copies were sold in the second week, and the album's position on the Billboard 200 fell to number 53. The album charted similarly in Australia, New Zealand (number 13) and on the Japanese chart (number 11). Elsewhere, the album failed {{to enter into the}} top 20. As of December 2012, Th1rt3en had sold 120,000 copies in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Mahabharata {{describes}} Vishnu {{holding a}} gada and a chakra, possibly indicating two-armed images of Vishnu. The Mahabharata also records {{at the time}} of the chakra-musala war, Krishna's Kaumodaki along with other weapons appear in human form from the heavens to watch the battle. The Harivamsa, an appendix to the Mahabharata describes four of Vishnu's weapons <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> heavens to aid Krishna and his brother Balarama in his battle against Jarasandha. Balarama uses the plough and the club called Saunanda; while Krishna battles with Kaumodaki and the bow Sharanga.|$|E
5|$|There is {{also much}} {{information}} about how the universe was thought to work stored in the mythology of the constellations. The Barasana of the Amazon plan part of their annual cycle based on observation of the stars. When their constellation of the Caterpillar-Jaguar (roughly equivalent to the modern Scorpius) falls they prepare to catch the pupating caterpillars of the forest as they <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> trees. The caterpillars provide food at a season when other foods are scarce.|$|E

5|$|Titanfall {{received}} generally favorable reviews, {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. Critics praised the game's pilot–Titan balance, its Smart Pistol, fast-paced player mobility, and accessibility for players of all skill sets. Reviewers {{complained that the}} AI grunts were too unintelligent, that private match and community support features were lacking, and that the game had shipped with too few multiplayer modes. Multiple reviewers cited the Titan's feeling of grandiosity in the player experience—specifically, the thrill of watching a summoned Titan <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sky, but also the feeling of entering the Titan exoskeleton and of scaling a Titan to take it down.|$|E
5|$|Tourists {{and locals}} visit the cliffs {{on the western}} side of the {{peninsula}} for views of the ocean and the sunset - hence the name, Sunset Cliffs. There are surfing spots below the cliffs, such as Luscomb's, Garbage Beach, and New Break. The cliffs are unstable and can be dangerous; a woman died in a <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cliffs in December 2008, and other falls have resulted in injuries.|$|E
5|$|Ann {{discovers that}} her predecessor, Emily Jessel (Lightfoot), {{is buried in}} Bly's church, and is told that Jessel killed herself. She also begins to see the figures {{of a young man}} and a young woman around Bly. Mrs Grose dismisses Ann's stories, but one maid, Carla (Walker), tells Ann of the sexually abusive former valet Peter Quint (MacLiam). Mrs Grose reveals that Carla had been badly {{affected}} by the War, and is prone to flights of fancy. Later, Ann is woken at night by the figure of the woman, and follows her to find Flora standing next to an open window. The pair see Carla <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> roof, landing near Miles, who is in the garden. Ann rushes outside, and sees the male figure on the roof. Inside again, Mrs Grose assures Ann that she must be confused.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{disadvantage}} in numbers {{as well as}} attacking a fixed position, Williams' and Macdonell's small force was driving the opposing force {{to the edge of}} the gorge on which the redan was situated, and seemed on the verge of success before the Americans were able to regroup and stand firm. The momentum of the battle turned when a musket ball hit Macdonell's mount (causing it to rear and twist around) and another shot hit him in the small of the back, causing him to <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> horse. He was removed from the battlefield and died from his injuries early the next day. Captain Williams was laid low by a wound to the head, and Dennis by a severe wound to the thigh (although he continued to lead his detachment throughout the action). Carrying Macdonnell and the body of Brock, the British fell back through Queenston to Durham's Farm, a mile north near Vrooman's Point.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} that Matt Hardy was not medically cleared to compete (due to an injury suffered on a previous episode of SmackDown), and a match {{was announced}} with Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) defending his WWE United States Championship against the fans' choice between Kane, The Great Khali, and Mark Henry. The second match was for the ECW Championship between CM Punk and The Miz, {{the winner of the}} voting. The match was back and forth {{for the first half of}} the match. The Miz gained the advantage after forcing Punk to <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> second rope. Punk came back after hip tossing The Miz from the top rope. Punk won the match after a GTS.|$|E
5|$|Local {{architect}} Thomas Bower performed some alterations to {{the house}} for Robert Crewe-Milnes in 1896, including extending the service wing. Few changes to the hall itself occurred during Calmic's tenancy. The company installed central heating in around 1948, and later constructed an office extension {{on the north side}} of the house, which was demolished a few years after the building's conversion into an hotel. Calmic had undertaken only cosmetic maintenance work, and by the 1970s the fabric of the building was in poor repair. A major stonework <b>fall</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north gable during high winds in 1974 led Wellcome to carry out an extensive restoration programme to both the interior and the exterior, which was completed in 1979 at a cost of £500,000 (£ today).|$|E
