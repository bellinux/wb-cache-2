When I was in Spain on Kingdom, I {{realized}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> it back. It was an empty, damaging gesture." [...] In an interview with Collider.com he stated that, [...] "It was demoralizing to write a really good book and to realize how little the rewards were, even though the book did quite well, as far as first novels are concerned." [...] Light House was available in a German edition, translated by Ulrike Seeberger.|$|E

I didn't do anything for a year. I was fortunate enough that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> my children a hot lunch. Then, I decided I wanted to work again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> {{their old}} road three times over," [...] he muttered, {{playing with a}} paper-knife, and moving restlessly to and fro.|$|E
60|$|This nearly made me drop with amazement. I {{had only}} about seventy-five dollars left, and I {{had been very}} much afraid that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>buy</b> the mustang, let alone the pack-pony and saddle.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ambassador}} {{has stated}} that his daughter had witnessed the atrocities she described and that her presence in Kuwait could be verified by the United States Embassy in Kuwait. He also stated [...] "If I wanted to lie, or {{if we wanted to}} lie, if we wanted to exaggerate, I wouldn't use my daughter to do so. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>buy</b> other people to do it." ...|$|R
60|$|Ind. 'Tis now, that I {{begin to}} live again; Heavens, I forgive you all my fear and pain: Since I behold my Aureng-Zebe appear, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>buy</b> {{him at a}} price too dear. His name alone afforded me relief, Repeated as a charm to cure my grief. I that loved name did, as some god, invoke, And printed kisses on it, while I spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{perfectly}} beastly! Can't {{it be done}} somehow? There must be a way. I know <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> a small Gallery for {{ten thousand}} pounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|Barker laughed. [...] "But listen. I {{found that}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> up their whole plant {{and all the}} {{ditching}} along the Black Spur Range for ten thousand dollars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> the {{furniture}} now hired for me," [...] said I, [...] "and {{one or two}} other little things, I should be quite at home there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{prefer to}} arrange them for myself,--if I can. It comes to this, {{that it may}} be {{possible}} to buy the reversion of the property. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>buy</b> it all;--or if I did, must sell a portion of it to raise the money. I have been thinking it over and making calculations. If we let Walker's farm go, and Ingram's, <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> manage the rest. Of course it would depend on the value of my own life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She isn't {{the sort}} to care {{who or what}} you are," [...] he answered. [...] "And as for the rest, <b>I</b> suppose she <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> any of us up if she wanted to. Her {{interest}} in you is rather a curious one. No time to explain it now. She'll tell you." ...|$|R
60|$|The first {{answer that}} {{naturally}} occurs to one is that, although different people {{may see the}} table slightly differently, still they all see more or less similar things {{when they look at}} the table, and the variations in what they see follow the laws of perspective and reflection of light, so that it is easy to arrive at a permanent object underlying all the different people's sense-data. I bought my table from the former occupant of my room; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>buy</b> his sense-data, which died when he went away, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> and did <b>buy</b> the confident expectation of more or less similar sense-data. Thus it is the fact that different people have similar sense-data, and that one person in a given place at different times has similar sense-data, which makes us suppose that over and above the sense-data there is a permanent public object which underlies or causes the sense-data of various people at various times.|$|R

6000|$|Brooke {{smiled a}} trifle drily. [...] "I hope so," [...] he said. [...] "Still, I shall have left more than <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> {{with a great}} many dollars behind me in Canada." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{likely that}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> {{things of that}} kind, and keep as smart a team as our friend does, if I struck you for the {{interest}} he charges on your held-over accounts." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Everyone thought I had wealthy parents because <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{afford to}} <b>buy</b> a bike before I was 16 but {{for three years}} I never bought an ice-cream, a Coca-Cola or {{anything}} like that. After I left school I had two jobs - as did Raye - and that's how we saved enough money to come to England {{when we were little}} more than children." ...|$|R
5000|$|Why the German {{entrepreneur}} founded Veganz, {{he explained}} {{in an interview}} with Organic&Wellness News in the fall 2015: [...] "In 2008 I had a burn-out and took some time off. Then I feel in love with a woman who was a vegetarian, so I tried out the vegetarian lifestyle and soon afterwards became a vegan. Back then it was difficult finding vegan foods and I stood in the grocery store wondering which products <b>I</b> <b>could</b> actually <b>buy</b> - and that is when I hit upon the idea of opening a vegan supermarket! We found a suitable location in Berlin, found investors, staff and products and in early 2011 I opened the first Veganz store in Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg neighbourhood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure that}} we are greatly obliged to you," [...] Jean said. [...] "As I told you, when {{relating}} our adventure in Nantes, we had to leave our horses behind us there though, had we captured the town, we should have recovered them. As it is, the Blues carried off the two I had left behind at the chateau, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>buy</b> one other, as we came through. That I detailed for the use of my wife. I certainly had not expected to obtain another, until we captured some from the enemy. We are heartily obliged to you, not only for your generous gift, but for your thoughtful kindness in sending for them for us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] exclaimed Rollo, [...] "I {{could take}} care of you {{perfectly}} well. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> the tickets and show you down to supper, and help you over the plank at the landings, and every thing else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Can you wonder, then, that I {{cursed the}} whole Stuart race, false-hearted, lecherous, and cruel? For the Hall, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> it back to-morrow if I chose, {{but why should}} I do so when I have no heir?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Pointing to a great, bright tear that {{shone on}} the blue velvet, she said, with her cheek against her mother's: [...] "I always wanted a real diamond, and there's a more {{precious}} one than any <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>buy.</b> Now I'm sure my jewel-box is full." ...|$|E
30|$|Participants had {{to answer}} how much they agree or {{disagree}} with the statements on a five-point Likert scales which ranged from 1 as “strongly disagree” to 5 as “strongly agree”. Original scoring provides scores on three factors of materialism: Success (example item: “The things I own say a lot how well I’m doing in life.”), Centrality (example item: “I like a lot of luxury in my life.”) and Happiness (example item:”I’d be happier if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> afford to <b>buy</b> more things.”). The scale included three items to tap each of three factors.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, five-and-twenty, or even twenty. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> manage on twenty. And then we <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> a {{commission}} for dear Ferdinand.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please God," [...] {{returned}} William deliberately, [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> groceries, {{and bits}} o' tapes, and thread, and what I thought would sell, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> begin hawking at first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> its secrets," [...] Dorward remarked, finally shaping a {{cigarette}} and lighting it, [...] "we should be big bidders, I think. I'd give fifty thousand dollars myself {{to be able to}} cable even a hundred words of their conversation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{so sorry}} to {{disappoint}} you," [...] she concluded, [...] "but I simply couldn't tell that poor, lonely child that the cake wasn't intended for her. I've brought all the goodies {{home with me}} that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>buy,</b> and we'll {{have to do the}} best we can without the fruit cake." ...|$|E
6000|$|Haskins {{was like}} a man struck {{on the head with}} a sandbag; he couldn't think; he stammered as he tried to say: [...] "But I never'd git the use You'd rob me!

6000|$|... "No," [...] said June shrewdly, [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> for ten {{thousand}}; {{that would}} only be four hundred a year. But I should {{have to pay a}} thousand a year rent, and {{that would only}} leave me five hundred. If I had the Gallery, Dad, think what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make Eric Cobbley's name in no time, and ever so many others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place, I should {{purchase}} a large ground sheet, which I might {{use as a}} tent. I would have a smaller one to lie upon, and the biggest mackintosh that money <b>could</b> <b>buy.</b> Then, as you say, with a good supply of tea and chocolate, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make myself extremely happy.|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{think of}} it!" [...] softly sobbed Mrs. Cliff, {{after she had}} {{carefully}} closed her bedroom door. [...] "With this and what I am to get, I believe <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> the bank, and yet I can only sit here and {{try to think of}} some place to hide this dangerous piece of paper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> them at {{that price}} at the 'Café Morisot,' Rue de la Verrerie, where, I suppose, you got them a little cheaper."

6000|$|... 'I had to {{give them}} to the fox,' replied the magpie in a quivering voice; 'he has been here {{twice in the last}} week, and wanted to cut down my tree for the purpose of making snow-shoes out of it, and the only way <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>buy</b> him off was by giving him two of my young ones.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Lloyd {{has been}} a lifelong {{supporter}} of Accrington Stanley F.C., and played for them during the 1960s. Lloyd has maintained links with the club after his playing career ended, and in May 2009 he voiced his wishes {{to become involved in}} the club {{from the point of view}} of investment. He stated to the Accrington Observer that [...] "I love football and always have. I was talking to Eric Whalley about it the other day and he said he wanted to sell and <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> afford to <b>buy</b> the club off him. I can’t do that but I would like some involvement and perhaps raise the profile of Accrington Stanley. The town needs a football club – and I want to help to make sure they have one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] exclaimed Florence, [...] "it's a pity it {{has taken}} you so long to learn that truth. I suppose I'm fond of money--at least, I'm fond of the things I used to fancy it <b>could</b> <b>buy,</b> but by degrees I found out that it can't buy those that are really worth the most. Now it almost looks as if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get them at home--without any cost." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have never}} {{declined}} paying the highway tax, because I am as desirous {{of being a}} good neighbor as I am of being a bad subject; and as for supporting schools, I am doing my part to educate my fellow countrymen now. It is for no particular item in the tax bill that I refuse to pay it. I simply wish to refuse allegiance to the State, to withdraw and stand aloof from it effectually. I do not care to trace {{the course of my}} dollar, if <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> till it <b>buys</b> a man or a musket to shoot one with--the dollar is innocent--but I am concerned to trace the effects of my allegiance. In fact, I quietly declare war with the State, after my fashion, though I will still make use and get what advantages of her I can, as is usual in such cases.|$|R
