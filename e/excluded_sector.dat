Focusing on the dynamics of CP-violation required for asymmetry generation, we discuss general considerations for successful two-step baryogenesis. Using a concrete model realization, we illustrate in detail the viability of this scenario and the implications for present and future electric dipole moment (EDM) searches. We find that CP-violation associated with a partially <b>excluded</b> <b>sector</b> may yield the observed baryon asymmetry while evading present and future EDM constraints.

40|$|Includes bibliographySocial capital {{means the}} set of norms, {{institutions}} and organizations that promote trust and cooperation among persons in communities and also in wider society. In those formulations of the social capital paradigm (and of the neoinstitutional economics on which they are partly based); which focus on its collective manifestations, it is claimed that stable relationships based on trust and cooperation can reduce transaction costs, produce public goods and facilitate the constitution of social actors and even of sound civil societies. Community social capital is a particular form of social capital which comprises the informal content of institutions that aim {{to contribute to the}} common good. Even some of the foundational authors of the social capital paradigm have doubts about the feasibility of creating such capital in groups where it does not already exist. The peasant communities of Chiquimula (Guatemala); covered by the anti-poverty "Support Project for Small-scale Producers of Zacapa and Chiquimula" (PROZACHI); displayed a relatively individualistic culture of dependence and domination {{yet at the same time}} had a broad and dynamic repertoire of various norms, including some which could serve as a symbolic support for solidary and reciprocal practices. Chiquimula seemed to lack social capital institutions, but with the recovery of institutional practices of the past and the emergence of new contexts and opportunities for developing new group strategies it has been possible to create social capital in these communities, with external support and training, and thus turn an <b>excluded</b> <b>sector</b> into a social actor on the micro-regional scene...|$|E
40|$|MBA - WBSLimiting {{access to}} a company’s {{services}} or discouraging the demand coming from certain customers is not an uncommon practice. Suppliers of services and goods often select a target market that would provide a minimum expected value and exclude the rest. In the financial services sector the lower income segment have always been excluded {{on the basis that}} they do not provide this minimum expected value (Sharma, 2003). In South Africa, however there is a renewed interest in targeting this lower income sector. This renewed interest in targeting the lower income sector in post apartheid South Africa is not just because there is value and benefits to companies who target this market (Prahalad, 2004), or the recognition that financial service development causes growth and poverty alleviation (Porteous, 2004; Beck, 2004), but it is also in place to address the imbalances caused by an apartheid system. Although South African financial service providers find themselves with similar challenges of a developing economy, the South African environment is a unique one. Practices of exclusion have not just segmented on the basis of income, minimum value expectations, education and status but also on race. In reentering this market, many providers are finding themselves unprepared for the challenges of this once <b>excluded</b> <b>sector.</b> Whilst cost, accessibility, insufficient discretionary income and literacy have been identified as the key factors that hinder the consumption of financial services, the Financial Sector Charter of 2003 identified that the South African financial sector had failed to increase participation of the previously excluded and limited access to its services (Crotty, 2005; Prahalad, 2004; Barr, 2004; Sharma, 2003). By committing to the targets of the Charter many of these financial institutions, which include banks, long - term insurers, short - term insurers, re-insurers, collective investment schemes, investment managers, retirement funds and licensed exchanges, find themselves targeting a market which they previously excluded. A further challenge to financial service iii providers in South Africa is that little research has been conducted on the unique situational variables that impact the South African economy. The {{purpose of this study is}} therefore to identify and explore the challenges that the previously excluded market presents to financial service providers who wish to re-enter this market in South Africa. It also investigates the appropriateness of segmentation tools and assesses how best to target this market. The research methodology employed focussed on a literature review which aimed to identify the factors that influence financial service consumption. It then discusses the various segmentation models and the best strategy to target this market. Focus groups were used to gain insight and understanding of this market. Data was then collected and analysed. The findings and discussion highlight that it is imperative to understand the changing demographics, social and cultural influences and the impact of historical practices prior to providing financial services to a market that was previously excluded. Factors that are unique to South Africa i. e. self exclusion, crime, non traditional market instruments and costs were also identified. These factors are discussed in this study. It is hoped that this study will assist providers of financial services in formulating strategy that would increase consumption of its products and services and in so doing contribute to the growth of the economy whilst addressing the imbalances of the past...|$|E

It proposes a theoretical model named ‘enabling identity’ that presents the stages whereby, under the guiding role played by the community of philosophic inquiry, the hegemonic meta-narrative of the mainstream society makes room for the identity of members of marginalised groups. The model is based on the recognition of diverse narratives within a web of communal narratives that does not favour the meta-narrative.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{economic}} impacts of linking the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) to emerging schemes beyond Europe, {{in the presence}} of a post-Kyoto agreement in 2020. Simulations with a numerical multi-country model of the world carbon market show that linking the European ETS induces only marginal economic benefits: As trading is restricted to energy-intensive industries that are assigned generous initial emissions, the major compliance burden is carried by non-trading industries excluded from the linked ETS. In the presence of parallel government trading under a post-Kyoto Protocol, <b>excluded</b> <b>sectors</b> can however be substantially compensated by international trading at the country level, thus increasing the political attractiveness of the linking process. From an efficiency perspective, a desirable future climate policy regime represents a joint trading system that enables international emission trading between ETS companies and governments. While the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) cannot alleviate the inefficiencies of linked ETS, in a parallel or joint trading regime the access to abatement options of developing countries induces large additional cost savings. Restricting CDM access via a supplementarity criterion does not significantly decrease the economic benefits from project-based emission crediting.

Numerical simulations with a multi-country equilibrium model of the global carbon market show that linking the European ETS induces only minor economic benefits.

In the presence of parallel government trading under a post-Kyoto Protocol, the burden of the <b>excluded</b> <b>sectors</b> can be substantially alleviated by international permit trade at the country level. However, the parallel carbon markets of linked ETS companies and post-Kyoto governments are still separated here. From an efficiency perspective, the most desirable future climate policy regime is thus represented by a joint trading system facilitating international emissions trading between ETS companies and post-Kyoto governments. While the Clean Development Mechanism is not able to attenuate the inefficiencies within linked ETS, in a parallel or joint trading regime the economy-wide access to project-based abatement options in developing countries induces large additional cost-savings. ...|$|R

Does MAS proposal on participation lead to alternative development or postneoliberal options? This thesis concludes that despite the MAS government’s efforts to politicize participation and agrarian development, in practice, and outside the heated moments of politically charged participation by social movements, the relationship between reaching technical efficiency and social justice is largely contingent; there is no one-to-one relationship between politics and technology. Concrete interventions in agrarian development have technical aspects where both versions of participation have to collaborate.

On the macro level a number of government policies around the liberalisation of the financial industry has made it easier for banks to sell credit and access it from overseas, whilst on the micro level attitudinal changes in spending habits and increasing acceptance of debt as a normal part of life has led to a much wider use of credit such as credit cards, hire purchase, bank debt and personal loans. The report also includes a literature review which looks at international literature which looks at a number of explanations of the growth of non-mortgage household debt, exploring among other things, how those on more modest incomes have become prone to using credit to supplement their often inadequate incomes. Ultimately the ‘hierarchy of debt’ which ranks debt types (student loan, credit card, personal etc) in order of their utility to the consumer, illustrates how the financially <b>excluded</b> <b>sectors</b> of society are forced to use those types of credit that are the least desirable in terms of interest rates and other related costs...|$|R
