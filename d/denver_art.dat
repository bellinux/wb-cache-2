5|$|Denver {{has many}} nationally {{recognized}} museums, {{including a new}} wing for the <b>Denver</b> <b>Art</b> Museum by world-renowned architect Daniel Libeskind, the second largest Performing Arts Center in the nation after Lincoln Center in New York City and bustling neighborhoods such as LoDo, filled with art galleries, restaurants, bars and clubs. That {{is part of the}} reason why Denver was, in 2006, recognized for the third year in a row as the best city for singles. Denver's neighborhoods also continue their influx of diverse people and businesses while the city's cultural institutions grow and prosper. The city acquired the estate of abstract expressionist painter Clyfford Still in 2004 and built a museum to exhibit his works near the <b>Denver</b> <b>Art</b> Museum.|$|E

2500|$|Structure M7-1 is a [...] high temple pyramid with a base {{measuring}} [...] The temple shrine is {{fashioned from}} well-finished stones and is {{of a similar}} style to that of Tikal Temple I. The pyramid has two smaller mounds attached to it at the base, forming a triadic temple group. Both of the smaller mounds have been damaged by looters' trenches. [...] A wooden lintel was illegally removed from the temple in the late 1960s and sold to the <b>Denver</b> <b>Art</b> Museum in the United States, provoking the first official visits and explorations of the site. The looted lintel was returned to Guatemala in 1998. The lintel was carved from five planks of sapodilla wood, forming a panel [...] long and [...] wide. The lintel is incomplete but depicts a standing human figure holding a ceremonial staff. The figure is surrounded by hieroglyphic writing {{on both sides and}} above it. The style of dress of the figure has been used to date the lintel to the late 6th century AD.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the best}} known {{paintings}} of Helnwein's oeuvre is Epiphany I – Adoration of the Magi, (1996, oil and acrylic on canvas, 210cm x 333cm, collection of the <b>Denver</b> <b>Art</b> Museum). It is part of a series of three paintings: Epiphany I, Epiphany II (Adoration of the Shepherds), Epiphany III (Presentation at the Temple), created between 1996 and 1998. In Epiphany I, SS officers surround a mother and child group. To judge by their looks and gestures, they appear to be interested in details such as head, face, back and genitals. The arrangement of the figures clearly relates to motive and iconography of the adoration of the three Magi, such as were common especially in the German, Italian and Dutch 15th century artworks. Julia Pascal wrote about this work in the New Statesman: [...] "This Austrian Catholic Nativity scene has no Magi bearing gifts. Madonna and child are encircled by five respectful Waffen SS officers palpably in awe of the idealised, blonde Virgin. The Christ toddler, who stands on Mary's lap, stares defiantly out of the canvas." [...] Helnwein's baby Jesus is often considered to represent Adolf Hitler.|$|E
