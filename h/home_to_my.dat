I'm needing some space, some time, until my head-slash-heart-slash-soul- No, no, no she didn't want to divide herself any-more, three persons in one Yo." ...|$|E

500|$|In early September, {{another letter}} from Parker arrived saying that Stockel wished {{to provide the}} copyist's fee for writing out the orchestral parts in Finland. As 1913 drew to a close, Sibelius had not made much {{progress}} on the American commission, having spent the entire autumn on other pieces and revisions. A trip to Berlin in January 1914 followed, and Sibelius's diary and correspondence indicate the Stoeckel commission was {{at the forefront of}} his mind; an initial plan to set Rydberg's poem Fantasos and Sulamit subsequently was discarded. His stay in Berlin was not productive, and in mid-February he returned to Helsinki ("Uneasy because of the America thing [...] Presumably have to go <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> cell {{in order to be able}} to concentrate".) ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Beckinsale starred {{opposite}} Sam Rockwell in {{the independent}} drama Snow Angels, {{based on the novel}} by Stewart O'Nan. The harrowing film, in which she played an overwhelmed single mother, put Beckinsale [...] "in kind of a tough place." [...] "I did have my kid, my husband and, in fact, my ex was around a lot, so it was very nice to come <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> people whom I love." [...] Puig felt [...] "Beckinsale gives her best performance in years" [...] while Richard Corliss of Time described it as [...] "her sharpest work yet." [...] However, Scott felt that [...] "her skill and discipline cannot overcome the sense that she is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem. Hard as she works to convince us otherwise, it’s a stretch to believe that a woman with the kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would wind up with an underachieving mouth breather like Glenn." [...] The film grossed just $414,404 worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Smithers {{was partly}} {{based on how}} {{numerous}} Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' orientation was pitched by Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but the writers should never draw {{too much attention to}} it and should try to keep it {{in the back of their}} heads. [...] Jay Kogen said [...] "Originally he was gay and black...But we thought it was too much so we just kept him gay." [...] The script for [...] "Blood Feud" [...] originally featured Smithers saying [...] "Just leave me enough to get <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> wife and kids", but the line had to be cut for time. Smithers is voiced by Harry Shearer, who is also the voice of Mr. Burns. Shearer is often able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Dan Castellaneta occasionally fills in for Shearer at table reads and voices Smithers. The name Waylon was first used in [...] "I Married Marge" [...] and comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers.|$|E

2500|$|The austere {{beauty of}} Euclidean {{geometry}} {{has been seen}} by many in western culture as a glimpse of an otherworldly system of perfection and certainty. Abraham Lincoln kept a copy of Euclid in his saddlebag, and studied it late at night by lamplight; he related that he said to himself, [...] "You never can make a lawyer {{if you do not}} understand what demonstrate means; and I left my situation in Springfield, went <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> father's house, and stayed there till I could give any proposition in the six books of Euclid at sight". Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote in her sonnet [...] "", [...] "O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day, When first the shaft into his vision shone Of light anatomized!". Einstein recalled a copy of the Elements and a magnetic compass as two gifts that had a great influence on him as a boy, referring to the Euclid as the [...] "holy little geometry book".|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, after Shake Appeal disbanded, Adam Franklin {{composed}} the songs [...] "Volcano Trash", [...] "Afterglow", and [...] "Son of Mustang Ford" [...] (which would become Swerverdriver's first single). The former band mates {{were impressed with}} his work and assembled at Union Street Studios in Oxford to record a demo, with Adam Franklin shifting to lead vocals and his brother singing backup. Soon thereafter, Graham Franklin and Pulzer left the band to pursue other musical interests. Growing tired of the local scene, the group had decided to head to London, and there they met drummer and Edinburgh-native Graham Bonnar, formerly of the post-punk band The Shattered Family. Before leaving Oxford, they had handed their demo to Mark Gardener of local band Ride, who in turn {{passed it on to}} Alan McGee of Creation Records, <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>My</b> Bloody Valentine, The House of Love, and formerly The Jesus and Mary Chain. McGee signed them almost immediately after listening to the tape (while driving around downtown Los Angeles {{in the back of a}} limousine) and Swervedriver was born.|$|E

[...] The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 {{less than a year after}} it was constructed.
