I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I put myself in their position and {{tried to imagine what}} they were going through. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>so,</b> so into it and I think you can tell.|$|E

Journalist Larry Kane, who befriended Lennon in 1964, wrote a {{comprehensive}} biography of Lennon which detailed the [...] "Lost Weekend" [...] period. In the interview with Kane, Lennon explained his feelings about his time with Pang: [...] "You know Larry, I {{may have been the}} happiest I've ever been... I loved this woman (Pang), I made some beautiful music and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> fucked up with booze and shit and whatever." ...|$|E

I {{thought he was going to}} take a bite out of me so I lifted the veil I was wearing and had a stare-down with him and he opened his mouth and let out this huge roar. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> frightened my heart fell in my shoe. When he finally walked away, the director yelled 'Cut' and I had to take a long breather. But I could really relate to the lion. I feel like in a past life I was a lion or a cat or something." ...|$|E

500|$|The film's {{director}} and choreographer Ortega {{stated that the}} rehearsal footage and concept of making a film to document {{the preparation of the}} concerts had come about as [...] "an accident". Ortega stated the film was pieced together from [...] "private footage", shot by documentarians Sandrine Orabona and Tim Patterson of Jackson, and that before Jackson's death, was never intended to be released to the public, or even in general. [...] "The recordings were made so we could use them, then the tapes were destined for Michael 's private library. They have a real unguarded honesty to them." [...] Ortega stated that he had gotten the idea to use the rehearsal footage from Jackson's fans after his death: [...] "At first <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> many messages from fans around the world asking to see the shows, asking to see the footage and eventually I realized the journey wasn't over and we had to do this", and Ortega also stated that the film was made only for the Jackson fans: [...] " [...] is for the fans and the film will show the development and intentions of the show, and the concert as it moved closer to London." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gabriel {{was shot}} on a JVC GY-HD101E digital video camera. Abbess praised the JVC’s versatility, small size {{and its ability}} to shoot at night. Another crucial {{advantage}} to digital video was its cheapness: [...] "Ten years ago, we couldn’t have made this movie, because we would have had to shoot on film. It would have been as boring as bat shit, because we would only have had money to shoot a wide shot and two close ups before moving on. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> much better coverage shooting it this way." ...|$|E

Ever since then she has [...] "had a hard time wanting to do anything else".

Danzig also has a long-standing interest in New World Order related conspiracies: [...] "Not only have I {{always been interested in}} the families that run the world forever, that people know now as the Bilderberg Group. But there’s an older book called The Committee of 300 which tells you all about it. I mean, I got in trouble for this back in the 90s, talking about this kind of stuff -- how the United States is based on a Freemason thing, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> many government files on me from that one".|$|E
2500|$|She is, however, {{at pains}} to stress the {{differences}} between Narnia and her world: [...] "Narnia is literally a different world", she says, [...] "whereas in the Harry books {{you go into a}} world within a world that you can see if you happen to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday world. Generally there isn't much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored them when I was a child. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> caught up I didn't think CS Lewis was especially preachy.

2500|$|Westbrook {{has said}} that the cast and crew became like a second family to her, with the roles in the soap {{mirroring}} their relationships off-screen. In her autobiography she comments, [...] "Sid [...] and I became very close [...] we were as thick as thieves. When we weren't shooting together we'd hang out [...] Once Sid and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> bored hanging around on set that we decided to take the milk float for a spin around Albert Square, but Sid drove it too fast and turned it over [...] we couldn't stop laughing, but the producers didn't seem to share our amusement. We were seriously told off that day." [...] She has described other actors like Michelle Gayle, Letitia Dean, Adam Woodyatt and Nick Berry like brothers and sisters, and has said she was very close to older cast members such as June Brown, Wendy Richard, Mike Reid and Gillian Taylforth. She has also revealed that her off-screen relationship with actors McFadden and Kemp mirrored her character's on-screen one: [...] "In the soap they were my older brothers, always looking out for me, making sure I didn't get into trouble, and off set they were exactly the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|J. K.

2500|$|Nancy's {{hair has}} {{dominated}} her many styles {{and she has}} had several different hair colours. When asked about her character's [...] "crazy" [...] hair styles Fox revealed that the ideas for the styles are a collaboration of her own ideas and the production teams': [...] "I had a brown bob forever and I was sick to death of it, so when {{we came out of}} the Jake storyline last year, they wanted to change the image. They asked me if I wanted to dye it any colour, so I thought 'let's go red'". Fox said that her initial Hollyoaks image featuring green hair was [...] "definitely not a good look". She added that during her tenura Nancy has had a [...] "few hair disasters", especially the in between stages when she [...] "went back to black from red and then to blonde". She said that since her character has been through so much she no longer feels it necessary to [...] "desperately shock" [...] everyone with her hair styles as she has had to grow up and evolve. Fox said she enjoys Nancy's style which has [...] "evolved" [...] as she has [...] "been a Goth, she’s been a New Romantic and now I like to call her Dusty Springfield on acid! It’s a bit Duffy, a bit ’50s-style, and now I’ve got the red hair it gives us more to play with". Fox added that [...] "one of my favourite things about being in a soap for a long time - I do get to change my image a lot". She said that she enjoys the feedback she receives from her style changes and when her latest style was aired and she had [...] "cut it into a short bob, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>so</b> many tweets from people - some negative, but mostly positive thankfully". She said that she would be open to changing her image in future. Fox has also commented on Nancy's large tattoo on her back, which she deemed to be [...] "too masculine". Fox said that when she was initially on the serial she found it [...] "great to be different" [...] but felt that it was difficult playing the [...] "alternative" [...] character of Nancy when her colleagues were such [...] "gorgeous, glamourous women". The tattoo has since disappeared. Of the character's dress sense the Hollyoaks wardrobe department said [...] "Nancy Hayton has a unique distinctive look on Hollyoaks. She wears rich colours and vibrant patterns, which compliment [...] her slim shape".|$|E
