50|$|This {{cleavage}} {{can occur}} via three mechanisms (classical pathway, alternative pathway and lectin pathway) that {{ultimately lead to}} the formation of a C3 convertase.

40|$|The {{immunological}} synapse between T {{cells and}} tumor cells {{is believed to}} be important for <b>effective</b> tumor <b>clearance.</b> However, the immunological synapse has never been imaged or analyzed in detail in human tissue. In this work, intercellular interactions between T cells and tumor cells were analyzed in detail in human glioblastoma. After characterization of the population of infiltrating T cells by multiple immunofluorescence staining and stereological quantification, the microanatomy of T cell-tumor cell intercellular communication was analyzed in detail using confocal microscopy and three-dimensional rendering. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes that infiltrated human glioblastoma underwent rearrangement when in contact with tumor cells, to form a three-dimensional structure in the intercellular contact area; this was characterized by microclusters of the CD 3 /TCR complex, re-arrangement of the cytoskeleton, and granzyme B polarization. In addition, such T cell-targeted cells show fragmentation of the microtubular system and increased expression levels of cleaved caspase 3, which suggests that cytotoxic T lymphocytes likely provoke changes in tumor cells and subsequently induce cell death. These results show that the formation of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte immunological synapse occurs in human tissue and may be relevant for the <b>effective</b> immune-mediated <b>clearance</b> of tumorigenic cells, therefore opening up new avenues for glioblastoma immunotherapy...|$|R

40|$|Current {{therapy for}} {{phenylketonuria}} (PKU) consists of life-long dietary restriction of phenylalanine (Phe), which presents problems of adherence for patients.

Expression of PAH in both liver (the usual metabolic source of this enzyme) and skeletal muscle is under investigation.

40|$|How to {{determine}} ionic dialysance for the online assessment of delivered dialysis dose. BackgroundIonic dialysance may be equivalent to blood-water urea clearance corrected for recirculation (effective urea clearance); however, this is controversial. The aims {{of our study}} were (1) to verify in vivo whether the value of ionic dialysance {{is affected by the}} method of determination, given the effect of cardiopulmonary recirculation on inlet plasma water conductivity when the inlet dialysate conductivity is changed; and (2) to define the operative modalities for determining ionic dialysance to obtain an adequate estimate of <b>effective</b> urea <b>clearance.</b> MethodsThirty-three hemodialysis patients were studied during 186 dialysis sessions with low-flux polysulfone dialyzers using a modified Fresenius Medical Care 4008 B machine equipped with meters to measure inlet and outlet dialysate conductivities. This machine varied inlet dialysate conductivity (Cdi) according to the following pattern: starting from baseline (step 0), Cdi was increased by 8 % (step 1). After Cdi had reached the target value, which took 8 to 10 minutes, it was lowered to 8 % below the baseline value (step 2). After 8 to 10 minutes, when Cdi had reached the new target, it was returned to its starting value (step 3). Four values of Conventional ionic dialysance (using the standard formula) and actual ionic dialysance (taking into account cardiopulmonary recirculation) were obtained for each cycle and were compared among them and with <b>effective</b> urea <b>clearance</b> (Kde). ResultsMean Conventional dialysance values at steps 0 to 2 and 2 to 3 (190 and 189 mL/min) were similar and higher than those at steps 0 to 1 and 1 to 2 (171 and 181 mL/min). Mean Conventional ionic dialysance values underestimated Kde, particularly at steps 0 to 1 (- 22. 2 mL/min, P < 0. 001) and 1 to 2 (- 12. 6 mL/min, P < 0. 001). The actual dialysance values underestimated Kde by no more than 4. 3 mL/min (P < 0. 001). In steps 0 to 1 and 1 to 2, the underestimate of Kde by Conventional dialysance increased at higher values of Kde, but this relationship did not exist when considering actual dialysance. ConclusionsThe value of ionic dialysance is affected by the method of determination, given the effect of cardiopulmonary recirculation on inlet plasma water conductivity when inlet dialysate conductivity is changed. As a consequence, to provide a correct and direct estimate of <b>effective</b> urea <b>clearance,</b> ionic dialysance must be determined by changing inlet dialysate conductivity {{in such a way as}} to keep inlet plasma water conductivity constant by means of two symmetrical high and low dialysate conductivity steps...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{directed}} at obtaining information on the in vivo elimination rate of SC 5 b- 9, the terminal fluid-phase product of complement activation. A sandwich ELISA based {{on the use of}} mono- and polyclonal antibodies was constructed that permitted quantitation of rabbit SC 5 b- 9 in plasma. Rabbit serum was activated with inulin in vitro to generate SC 5 b- 9, and the activated serum was applied intravenously in normal and C 6 -deficient rabbits. Elimination of SC 5 b- 9 in normal rabbits was rapid, half-life in the range of 30 - 50 min. No differences were noted between the clearance of homologous rabbit and heterologous human SC 5 b- 9, SC 5 b- 9 concentrations returned to basal levels 2 - 3 h after application. Plasma of C 6 -deficient rabbits contained no SC 5 b- 9 and these animals displayed an even more <b>effective</b> <b>clearance</b> capacity for the complex. Quantitative considerations indicated that basal plasma SC 5 b- 9 levels in healthy animals result from a spontaneous turnover rate of approximately 0. 2 % of C 5 -C 9 components per h.
