5|$|The Wiyot {{tribe of}} California {{say that the}} condor recreated mankind after Above Old Man wiped {{humanity}} out with a flood. However, other tribes, such as California's Mono, viewed the condor as a destroyer, not a creator. They say that Condor seized humans, cut off their heads, and drained their blood {{so that it would}} flood Ground Squirrel's home. Condor then seized <b>Ground</b> <b>Squirrel</b> after he fled, but <b>Ground</b> <b>Squirrel</b> managed to cut off Condor's head when Condor paused to take a drink of the blood. According to the Yokut tribe, the condor sometimes ate the moon, causing the lunar cycle, and his wings caused eclipses. The Chumash tribe of Southern California believed that the condor was once a white bird, but it turned black when it flew too close to a fire.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{such as the}} California <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel,</b> western gray squirrel, and dusky-footed woodrat live in this region. Birds such as grosbeaks, flycatchers, western tanagers, and lazuli {{buntings}} {{are common}} in the area. Nine species of warblers, three species of vireos, and two species of thrushes can also be found. The pileated woodpecker has been spotted rarely in large pine trees.|$|E
5|$|Going {{higher in}} elevation, the {{coniferous}} forests become purer stands of red fir, western white pine, Jeffrey pine, lodgepole pine, {{and the occasional}} foxtail pine. Fewer wildlife species tend {{to be found in}} these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely to be found include golden-mantled <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel,</b> chickaree, fisher, Steller's jay, hermit thrush, and northern goshawk. Reptiles are not common, but include rubber boa, western fence lizard, and northern alligator lizard.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this study, the {{hibernation}} of <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> (Spermophilus xanthoprymnus) {{distributed in}} Central Anatolia were studied in laboratory and field conditions. According to our findings, the hibernation period of <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> {{began at the}} end of August and terminated in mid February. The longest and shortest hibernation bouts of <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> were found to be 100 and 21 days, respectively. In this period, the longest ununterrupted hibernation was 13 days. <b>Ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> gained weight during the early months of summer and then lost weight constantly throughout hibernation period. No marked periodic cycles were observed in the periods of weight loss, and <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> lost an average of 28 % of their total body weight during this period...|$|R
5|$|Many other symbols {{have been}} {{proposed}} for addition {{to the list of}} official state symbols but were never officially adopted. Since 1971, the white-tailed deer has been proposed as the state mammal eight times. Other creatures proposed as representations of the state have included the northern leopard frog, the eastern timber wolf, the thirteen-lined <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel,</b> and the Blanding's turtle. In 2007, another proposal, also unsuccessful, was to designate the Tilt-A-Whirl as the state's official amusement ride. It was invented in Faribault in 1926, and debuted at the Minnesota State Fair a year later.|$|E
5|$|Promiscuity, {{in which}} {{both males and females}} mate with {{multiple}} partners, also occurs in rodents. In species such as the white-footed mouse, females give birth to litters with multiple paternities. Promiscuity leads to increased sperm competition and males tend to have larger testicles. In the Cape <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel,</b> the male's testes can be 20 percent of its head-body length. Several rodent species have flexible mating systems that can vary between monogamy, polygyny and promiscuity.|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed thrasher can {{generally}} be found running rapidly from {{cover to cover}} or flying near ground level from bush to bush. However, this bird is not shy about being in the open. It is generally a forager on ground level but can be very aggressive in routing out potential competitors for food at feeders, such as the Inca dove and round-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel.</b> It will usually destroy any nest of cactus wrens.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Quantitative data {{concerning}} bait {{preference and}} bait application were collected for Belding's <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> (Spermophilus beldingi) during February-July 1975. Bait materials tested for preference were crimped oats, oatgroats, whole wheat, barley, rolled wheat, rye, chopped lettuce, chopped apple, oatgroats + Rhodamine B dye, oatgroats + starch paste, oatgroats + Rhoplex AC- 33, and oatgroats + green food dye. Significant differences occurred in amounts {{of different types}} of bait consumed (P 0. 10) affect amounts of oatgroats consumed. Amounts of bait applied had more affect than placement of bait in determining proportions of <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> consuming oatgroats stained with Rhodamine B dye. No significant differences (P > 0. 25) occurred in proportions of adult male and female <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> marked with stained bait. Differences in proportions of juvenile and adult <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> consuming stained bait were not statistically significant (Z = 0. 31). Proportions of Belding's <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> consuming stained bait were greatest in February, March, June, and July, but declined in April and May. Marking of <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> consuming stained bait decreased from 68 percent within a treated plot to 0 percent within 40 m beyond the same plot. Non-target species of rodents readily consumed stained oatgroats applied for Belding's <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels,</b> regardless of amount or method of application. Broadcasting of bait provided the most economical means of applying bait. Recommendations are presented concerning type and application of bait materials used to control depredations by Belding's <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels...</b>|$|R
50|$|Rattlesnakes {{have evolved}} {{specialized}} sensory organs (infrared-sensitive pit organs) that enhance {{their ability to}} predate small mammals. This ability to sense in the infrared {{set the stage for}} <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> to evolve antipredator counter-innovations that take advantage of the specialized sensory organs of rattlesnakes. Owings and colleagues found that <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> shunt blood to their tails when encountering rattlesnakes. This allows <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> to tail flag to rattlesnakes even in the dark with their hot tails that rattlesnakes can detect with infrared-sensitive pit organs. <b>Ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> do not shunt blood to their tails when they encounter gopher snakes, which also feed on their young, but lack infrared-sensitive pit organs.|$|R
50|$|Farmers {{and ranchers}} have {{developed}} {{a variety of ways}} to exterminate <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> besides trapping, shooting and poisoning. One such process fills the burrows with a mixture of oxygen and propane and then ignites the gas mixture. This kills the <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> with a concussive force that also collapses the tunnel systems. While both solutions are effective, <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> from outside of the treated areas will eventually spread back into the area.|$|R
5|$|Sixty-one {{species of}} mammals have been {{recorded}} in Grand Teton National Park. This includes the gray wolf, which had been extirpated from the region by the early 1900s but migrated into the Grand Teton National Park from adjacent Yellowstone National Park after the species had been reintroduced there. The re-establishment of the wolves has ensured that every indigenous mammal species now exists in the park. In addition to gray wolves, another 17 species of carnivores reside within Grand Teton National Park including grizzlies and the more commonly seen American black bear. Relatively common sightings of coyote, river otter, marten and badger and occasional sightings of cougar, Canadian lynx and wolverine are reported annually. A number of rodent species exist including yellow-bellied marmot, least chipmunk, muskrat, beaver, Uinta <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel,</b> pika, snowshoe hare, porcupine, and six species of bats.|$|E
5|$|Strandzha Nature Park has {{the richest}} {{vertebrate}} fauna among all protected areas in Bulgaria— 410 species, not counting 70 species of marine fishes. There are 66 breeding mammal species. Among {{the most common}} are the roe deer, red deer, wild boar, grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, European badger, and beech marten. The park protects {{some of the largest}} and most important populations of European otter and wildcat in Europe. The European pine marten and marbled polecat are uncommon in Strandzha. There are 25 bat species present including Bechstein's bat and Kuhl's pipistrelle. 27 species of small mammals at the park include European <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel,</b> lesser mole-rat, Günther's vole, three dormouse species, and two other globally threatened species. The park is an important sanctuary of the Roach's mouse-tailed dormouse. There have been reports on the presence of Mediterranean monk seals in the rocks and caverns of Silistar.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} 56 {{recorded}} mammal species. Grizzly and black bear inhabit the forested regions. Cougar, Canada lynx, wolverine, red fox, weasel, river otter, coyote, and timber wolf {{are the primary}} predatory mammals. Elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are common in the valleys of the park, including around (and sometimes in) the Banff townsite, while moose {{tend to be more}} elusive, sticking primarily to wetland areas and near streams. In the alpine regions, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, marmot and pika are widespread. Other mammals such as beaver, porcupine, squirrel, chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and Columbian <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> are the more commonly observed smaller mammals. Caribou were the rarest large mammals in the park, but an avalanche in 2009 may have killed the last five remaining within park boundaries.|$|E

50|$|His primary animal {{system for}} {{investigating}} animal behavior, social behavior and communication, and antipredator and counter-antipredator behavior was California <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> and snakes (especially rattlesnakes). Adult California <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> must defend against avian and mammalian predators. They also must defend their pups especially from predation by rattlesnakes and gopher snakes. Owings {{together with his}} students and colleagues discovered a number of behavioral and physiological defense mechanisms against snakes. When <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> encounter a predator, their first response is to typically vocalize in distinctly different ways to aerial and ground predators. Encounters with snakes may elicit ground predator vocalization, but <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> then shift to visual signaling by tail flagging.Tail flagging {{has the advantage of}} harassing snakes and deterring them from entering burrows with squirrel pups, but it has the disadvantage of requiring close proximity to snakes increasing the likelihood of snake bites. In response to this problem, <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> have evolved the capacity to neutralize rattlesnake venom.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> are {{generally}} quite social animals and some species even live in cohesive colonies. All <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> live in burrows, which in species like prairie dogs {{can be quite}} elaborate. The “contour flight with short glide attack” is essentially the only hunting technique used by golden eagles on <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels.</b> <b>Ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> usually forage within running distance {{of one of their}} burrow entrances, so it is essential for the golden eagle to have a surprise factor. Eagles will not enter burrows, unlike some mammalian carnivores that eat <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels.</b> When they hunt <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels,</b> golden eagles seem to choose their victim in the last few seconds before they strike. Most of the <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> targeted by the eagles are quite small, with the entire Spermophilus group and some prairie dogs weighing under [...] Marmots are a more formidable catch since most species weigh at least [...] in spring and about twice that by fall, which is roughly the highest weight feasible for a flying eagle to carry. Although they may locally target large numbers of juveniles, in other cases they may dismember an adult marmot after a kill so they are able to carry it to the nest. In the Alps, it is believed to be advantageous for eagles to nest below the meadows that host their Alpine marmot prey so they can fly downhill, a much easier flying method while carrying a heavy load than flying uphill.|$|R
5|$|While some of {{the native}} flora and fauna of the Sonoran Desert can be found within Phoenix city limits, most {{are found in the}} suburbs and the undeveloped desert areas {{surrounding}} the city. Native mammal species include coyote, javelina, bobcat, mountain lion, desert cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit, antelope <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel,</b> mule deer, ringtail, coati, and multiple species of bats, such as the Mexican free-tailed bat and western pipistrelle, that roost in and around the city. There are many species of native birds, including Costa's hummingbird, Anna's hummingbird, Gambel's quail, Gila woodpecker, mourning dove, white-winged dove, the roadrunner, the cactus wren, and many species of raptors, including falcons, hawks, owls, vultures (such as the turkey vulture and black vulture), and eagles, including the golden and the bald eagle.|$|E

The Aspen Parkland is the environment of choice for the white-tailed deer. The Moist Mixed Grassland ecoregion is characterized by white-tailed deer, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), coyote, rabbit, American badger (Taxidea taxus), red bat (Lasiurus borealis) and <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel</b> such as black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus). Animal populations of the Mixed Grassland enumerate pronghorn, white-tailed and mule deer, long-eared myotis (Myotis evotis), small-footed myotis (Myotis subulatus), jack rabbit, coyote, Richardson's <b>ground</b> <b>squirrel.</b> The only Canadian site of black-tailed prairie dog is in the Mixed Grassland prairie ecoregion. The raised elevation of the Cypress Upland results in white spruce and aspen forests and an ecoregion more resembling the boreal forested areas than the prairielands.

500|$|In {{polygynous}} species, males {{will try}} to monopolize and mate with multiple females. As with monogamy, polygyny in rodents can come in two forms; defense and non-defense. Defense polygyny involves males controlling territories that contain resources that attract females. This occurs in <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> like yellow-bellied marmots, California <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels,</b> Columbian <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> and Richardson's <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels.</b> Males with territories are known as [...] "resident" [...] males and the females that live within the territories are known as [...] "resident" [...] females. In the case of marmots, resident males {{do not appear to}} ever lose their territories and always win encounters with invading males. Some species are also known to directly defend their resident females and the ensuing fights can lead to severe wounding. In species with non-defense polygyny, males are not territorial and wander widely in search of females to monopolize. These males establish dominance hierarchies, with the high-ranking males having access to the most females. This occurs in species like Belding's <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> and some tree squirrel species.|$|R

40|$|During hibernation, <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> undergo many {{adaptive}} physiological changes {{including a}} reduction of respiration and blood flow. While reduced blood flow normally leads to blood clot formation in humans, <b>ground</b> <b>squirrels</b> appear to have internal biochemical mechanisms that prevent clot-formation during hibernation.
