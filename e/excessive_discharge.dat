40|$|Background: It {{is unknown}} whether smoking; age {{at time of}} {{radiotherapy}} or time since radiotherapy influence the intensity of late radiation-induced bowel syndromes. Material and methods: We have previously identified 28 symptoms decreasing bowel health among 623 gynecological-cancer survivors (three to twelve years after radiotherapy) and 344 matched population-based controls. The 28 symptoms were grouped into five separate late bowel syndromes through factor analysis. Here, we related possible predictors of bowel health to syndrome intensity, by combining factor analysis weights and symptom frequency on a person-incidence scale. Results: A strong (p <. 001) association between smoking and radiation-induced urgency syndrome was found with a syndrome intensity (normalized factor score) of 0. 4 (never smoker), 1. 2 (former smoker) and 2. 5 (current smoker). <b>Excessive</b> gas <b>discharge</b> was also related to smoking (p =. 001). Younger age at treatment resulted in a higher intensity, except for the leakage syndrome. For the urgency syndrome, intensity decreased with time since treatment. Conclusions: Smoking aggravates the radiation-induced urgency syndrome and <b>excessive</b> gas <b>discharge</b> syndrome. Smoking cessation may promote bowel health among gynecological-cancer survivors. Furthermore, by understanding the mechanism for the decline in urgency-syndrome intensity over time, we may identify new strategies for prevention and alleviation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Ocular flutter {{is a rare}} {{horizontal}} {{eye movement}} disorder characterized by rapid saccadic oscillations. <b>Excessive</b> <b>discharge</b> of burst neurons, and/or loss of tonic excitation of pause cells cause ocular flutter in several neurologic diseases.

Methods: We analyzed EOG findings of ocular flutter in four patients. Results: Ocular flutter, which was shown as rapid, repetitive, horizontal, symmetrical, and sinusoidal movements without intersaccadic intervals on EOG, was confirmed in four patients. The etiology of each patient was olivopontocerebellar atrophy (1 case), meningoencephalitis (2 cases), and lithium intoxication (1 case).

40|$|The spark gap, {{used as a}} {{sound source}} in scale model investigations, has {{advantages}} and disadvantages. One of the advantages is its limited size, which is particularly important for investigations at small scales. Also, the spark gap is omnidirectional and can be constructed such that the shape has a negligible influence on the sound field to be measured, for any scale factor. A disadvantage of an <b>excessive</b> <b>discharge</b> is {{the appearance of a}} shockwave. This leads to non-linear effects that make it impossible to acquire reliable impulse responses at small distances from the spark gap. A second disadvantage is the spread in successive separate impulse levels {{as a result of the}} micro-climate near the spark gap. Experiments were performed with a low energy spark gap (maximum electrode separation of 8 mm). In these experiments the energy was spread over a longer time interval through the use of spark trains. This allows for high INR values and reliable measurements of sound pressure levels. The period stability (jitter) of the spark train and spread in strength of the individual discharges were studied...|$|E
40|$|A {{probabilistic}} {{risk assessment}} (PRA) for the <b>discharge</b> of <b>excessive</b> nitrogen from nonpoint sources (NPSs) to a stream was performed {{for a small}} agricultural watershed in northern Virginia. Risk, by definition, {{is the product of}} the frequency of occurrence of an event and the consequences of that event. The purpose of this research was to determine the probability of occurrence of a nitrogen discharge event (i. e., frequency). The consequences of such a discharge event were not explicitly determined but were implicitly assumed to be negative in nature. An event tree was developed to show the basic hydrologic processes at work in a small watershed. However, the event tree could not be used to discover the causes for nitrogen loss from the watershed. Therefore, a fault tree was developed for <b>excessive</b> nitrogen <b>discharge</b> in surface runoff on any day from agricultural sources. The development of the fault tree was found to be a useful exercise in understanding the intricate cause and effect relationships between agricultural practices and NPS pollution.

40|$|Abstract The {{phosphorus}} {{and nitrogen}} discharge via effluent of intensive trout farming system was quantified {{through the use}} of environmental indicators. The nutrient loads, the mass balance, the estimated amount of nutrients in feed and the amount of nutrients converted in fish biomass were calculated based on the concentrations of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) in the feed and in the water. Of the offered feed, 24. 75 kg were available as P and 99. 00 kg as N, of these, 9. 32 kg P (38 %) and 29. 12 kg N (25 %) were converted into fish biomass and 15. 43 kg P (62 %) and 69. 88 kg N (75 %) were exported via effluent. The loads and the mass balance show the <b>excessive</b> <b>discharge</b> of nutrients via effluent, corroborated by the feed conversion ratio (2. 12 : 1) due to the low efficiency of feed utilization, therefore, it is proposed the use of this zootechnical parameter as environmental indicator. In addition, feed management practices are not adequate, highlighting the low frequency of feeding during the day, excessive amount and low quality of feed offered. These results demonstrate the need for adequate feed management and the need for careful monitoring of effluent...|$|E
40|$|The {{industrial}} sector {{is a major}} contributor to resource consumption and environmental pollution in China. The energy-intensive industrial development and energy structure are dominated by coal, which has produced an enormous amount of industrial pollutants in China, and put great pressure on the ecological environment. Hence, improving the performance of industrial green development (PIGD) has become an urgent task of utmost importance. This study applies a global non-radial directional distance function to estimate the PIGD for Jiangxi Province during 2003 – 2015, and provides targeted policy suggestions. The empirical results show a rising trend in the PIGD in Jiangxi Province. At the city level, Nanchang and Fuzhou performed considerably better than other cities in regards to their PIGD. However, the poor environmental performance caused by the <b>excessive</b> <b>discharge</b> of industrial pollutants has also hindered its PIGD. Most cities in Jiangxi Province failed to efficiently use resources, especially energy and labor, in industrial production. The results of the influencing factor analysis show that the performance of industrial green development in Jiangxi could be improved through increasing per capita GDP, decreasing the share of coal consumption in the total industrial energy consumption, and decreasing the share of industrial GDP in the total GDP. Furthermore, a more efficient use of environmental management investment funds and timely transfer of the surplus industrial labor are needed...|$|E
