5|$|In prior cases, {{the fear}} had been {{expressed}} that using parliamentary debates as evidence in court could violate parliamentary privilege, under Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1688 (since using parliamentary debates as evidence would involve discussing {{what went on}} in Parliament within the courts). Browne-Wilkinson held that: In my judgment, the plain meaning of article 9, viewed against the historical background in which it was enacted, was to ensure that Members of Parliament were not subjected to any penalty, civil or criminal for what they said and were able, contrary to the previous assertions of the Stuart monarchy, to discuss what they, as opposed to the monarch, chose to have discussed. Relaxation of the rule will not involve the courts in criticising what is said in Parliament. The purpose of looking at Hansard will not be to construe the words used by the Minister but to give effect to the words used so long as they are clear. Far from questioning the independence of Parliament and its debates, the courts would be giving effect to what <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> done there.|$|E
5|$|The arm-tefillin is laid on {{the inner}} side of the bare left arm, right arm if one is left handed, two finger breadths above the elbow, so that when the arm is bent the tefillin faces towards the heart. The arm-tefillin is {{tightened}} with the thumb, the blessing <b>is</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> the strap is immediately wrapped around the upper arm in the opposite direction it came from {{in order to keep the}} knot tight without having to hold it. Some wrap it around the upper arm for less than a full revolution (the bare minimum to keep the knot tight) and then wrap it around the forearm seven times, while others wrap it around the upper arm an additional time before wrapping it around the forearm. Many Ashkenazim wear the knot to be tightened (not to be confused with the knot on the base which is permanently tied and always worn on the inside, facing the heart) on the inside and wrap inward, while Nusach Sephard Ashkenazim and all Sephardim wear it on the outside and wrap outward.|$|E

25|$|The ritual book on {{pastoral}} {{care of the}} sick provides three rites: anointing outside Mass, anointing within Mass, and anointing in a hospital or institution. The rite of anointing outside Mass begins with a greeting by the priest, followed by sprinkling of all present with holy water, if deemed desirable, and a short instruction. There follows a penitential act, as {{at the beginning of}} Mass. If the sick person wishes to receive the sacrament of penance, it is preferable that the priest make himself available for this during a previous visit; but if the sick person must confess during the celebration of the sacrament of anointing, this confession replaces the penitential rite A passage of Scripture is read, and the priest may give a brief explanation of the reading, a short litany <b>is</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> the priest lays his hands on the head of the sick person and then says a prayer of thanksgiving over the already blessed oil or, if necessary, blesses the oil himself.|$|E

Regarding the press release, she stated: [...] "And I am especially excited to be sharing the stage with Lionel Richie who I have admired for taking pride in his art. This is an opportunity for South Africans to experience a quality production." [...] Beginning 13 March 2016, the singer gave a live rendition of [...] "Feelings" [...] and also sang songs [...] "S.O.S" [...] and [...] "Release Me". During her own Give and Take Live Tour, she performed [...] "Feelings" [...] during the conclusion of [...] "Spring" [...] section of the concert, which was accompanied by her songs [...] "When All <b>Is</b> <b>Said</b> <b>and</b> Done" [...] and [...] "Mzi Ka Phalo". The aforementioned series was released on both versions of her 2013 live album, Give and Take Live, as part of a collaboration with Sony Music Entertainment and Leely Music.|$|E
500|$|An early {{title for}} the album was When All <b>Is</b> <b>Said</b> <b>and</b> Done More Is Said Than Done, {{suggested}} by Fazzi. The group liked it, however, Fazzi said it was [...] "way too long to fit on a side of a CD". According to Lazzara, the album was given the title New Again because [...] "that's what it feels like. We are in a totally different band, just {{because there has been}} this new life breathed into the band with the addition of Matt." [...] The album was written in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Here, Rubano said the group [...] "stuck out on the street because we were so loud". For the album, the band embraced the concept that [...] "it's up to us to decide what Taking Back Sunday sounds like. We always want to be redefining what that means, and there's stuff on this record I think in the past we would have stayed away from", according to Rubano. Fazzi said the group wanted to [...] "put a new foot forward ... to show people that we're expanding the music". He noted that the song structures and chord patterns were [...] "just a bit stronger and smarter".|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded [...] "Earthling" [...] with a B. Unlike Isler, the A.V. Club {{reviewer}} {{loved the}} opening, calling it [...] "one of Fringes most effective freak-meets". Murray continued {{that he believed}} the episode to be [...] "an efficient action/adventure/horror hour, heavy on suspenseful moments and neat effects, light on character development and progress on the master-plot. When all <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> done and Fringe eventually ends its run, I'm betting that a newcomer {{will be able to}} skip 'Earthling' without putting a dent in their overall understanding of the show. But that doesn't mean it wasn't still cool to see people get reduced to dust right in front of our eyes. Jane Boursaw from AOL TV responded negatively to the episode, wishing it had not been yet another [...] "stand-alone creature feature". While praising the special effects, Boursaw expressed disinterest in learning more about Broyles and compared the Fringe case to something already done in The X-Files. She concluded, [...] "Take the creepy alien factor out of it, and this could have been any other police procedural". UGO Networks reviewer Alex Zalben also noted similarities to The X-Files, writing that [...] "the reason [...] is weird for Fringe is that, aforementioned evidence aside, they’ve been very careful to avoid the overarching alien mythology X-Files is famous for. Oops." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of what <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> {{depicted in the}} game is open to interpretation, leading fans to develop and discuss theories {{about the nature of}} the events that occur in the game. Let's Players Voidburger and Bob from the video-game related podcast The Grate Debate opined that the open-ended nature of the game is one of its greatest aspects. They also said that there may be something in the game that has not been discovered yet. They noted the colored lights as something they still had not figured out, and they felt that the game hinted that the radio may be the main culprit behind the father's killing. The game also contained a Swedish line in the radio describing a radio drama from 1938 being true, which gamers suggested may be a nod to Orson Welles's radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds. This possible reference to alien invasions was noted as a continuation of a Silent Hill tradition of having secret endings that included aliens. Another theory commonly discussed is deciphering the identity of the player character. The fetus talking to the player character about his remembering moments [...] "ten months back" [...] seems to imply that he is the father who killed Lisa and the kids, although Voidburger and Bob believe that the player character may be the protagonist that was to be in Silent Hills, as shown in the trailer following the ending of P.T.|$|E

In 1997, Destiny's Child {{released}} their major label debut song [...] "Killing Time" [...] on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black. The following year, the group released their self-titled debut album, scoring their first major hit [...] "No, No, No". The album established {{the group as a}} viable act in the music industry, with moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R/Soul Album of the Year, Best R/Soul or Rap New Artist, and Best R/Soul Single for [...] "No, No, No". The group released their Multi-Platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills", the group's first number-one single, [...] "Jumpin' Jumpin'" [...] and [...] "Say My Name", which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. [...] "Say My Name" [...] won the Best R Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide. During this time, Beyoncé recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song [...] "After All <b>Is</b> <b>Said</b> <b>and</b> Done" [...] for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man.|$|E
500|$|Allgame {{said the}} {{enjoyment}} [...] "isn't bad", but limited: [...] "You can only blow {{up so much}} stuff with a helicopter." [...] Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot in his PlayStation review called the game tired and mediocre, but reviewing the PC version, Shane Mooney wrote: [...] "I'm happy {{to say that the}} much-maligned action-heavy, plot-light genre has received a solid kick in the pants from the wonderfully fun Nuclear Strike." [...] Mooney praised the successful port from the console version and believed players would [...] "find plenty to slobber over in this extremely entertaining title." [...] Daily Radar said: [...] "When it comes to creating an action game, {{it would be nice to}} play something that requires a little bit more than just holding down the fire button continuously. In Nuclear Strike 64, that's just about all you do." [...] The website said: [...] "if all you're looking for is a game where you can fly around in a helicopter, drive a tank and manipulate 10 other vehicles in a destructive fest, well, here you go." [...] Allgame summarised: [...] "When all <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> done, Nuclear Strike 64 is a fine example of an excellent shooting game." [...] The reviewer believed that gamers would appreciate the game's longevity and variety. Game Revolution praised the helpful interface and responsive controls and said the mechanics were generally good, but complained of an occasionally inaccurate targeting system. The website acclaimed the [...] "perfect" [...] difficulty level. GameFan took issue with enemies shooting the player's vehicle while not visible on-screen. GameSpot's minor complaints were infrequent game saves, a [...] "too easy" [...] structure allowing supply lines to be destroyed before the main forces, a short game despite large missions and a lack of multiplayer.|$|E
