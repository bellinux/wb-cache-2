They are fitted with dual <b>driving</b> <b>stations</b> to permit operation in either direction without the requirement to turn the locomotive ...|$|R
40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the {{construction}} design of elevator for pallets with car seats weighing 200 kg. This device is proposed for vertical transport of the load between two working positions which are separated by 6 m. Part of the pallet hoist is a roller conveyor attached on a lifting frame. The roller conveyor allows loading and unloading pallets from the fixed roller conveyors in the lower and upper station. There are the functional calculations of important parts, strength control of traction belt and shaft of driving pulley drum. By FEM (Finite Element Method) is detected stress distribution of the lifting frame. Parts of the annex are the manufacturing drawings of the lifting frame, shaft of driving drum, the <b>driving</b> <b>station</b> and drawing of the whole assembly vertical conveyor. Furthermore, the timing diagram function for one cycle, risk analysis and FMEA...|$|E
40|$|Several {{years ago}} Sandia National Laboratories {{developed}} a prototype interior robot [1] that could navigate autonomously inside a large complex building to aid and test interior intrusion detection systems. Recently the Department of Energy Office of Safeguards and Security {{has supported the}} development of a vehicle that will perform limited security functions autonomously in a structured exterior environment. The goal of the first phase of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of an exterior robotic vehicle for security applications by using converted interior robot technology, if applicable. An existing teleoperational test bed vehicle with remote driving controls was modified and integrated with a newly developed command <b>driving</b> <b>station</b> and navigation system hardware and software to form the Robotic Security Vehicle (RSV) system. The RSV, also called the Sandia Mobile Autonomous Navigator (SANDMAN), has been successfully used to demonstrate that teleoperated security vehicles which can perform limited autonomous functions are viable and have the potential to decrease security manpower requirements and improve system capabilities...|$|E

40|$|The Space Station/Space Operations Mechanism Test Bed {{consists}} of the following: a hydraulically driven, computer controlled Six Degree-of-Freedom Motion System (6 DOF); a six degree-of-freedom force and moment sensor; remote <b>driving</b> <b>stations</b> with computer generated or live TV graphics; and a parallel digital processor that performs calculations to support the real time simulation. The function of the Mechanism Test Bed is to test docking and berthing mechanisms for Space Station Freedom and other orbiting space vehicles in a real time, hardware-in-the-loop simulation environment. Typically, the docking and berthing mechanisms are composed of two mating components, one for each vehicle. In the facility, one component {{is attached to the}} motion system, while the other component is mounted to the force/moment sensor fixed in the support structure above the 6 DOF. The six components of the contact forces/moments acting on the test article and its mating component are measured by the force/moment sensor...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we empirically {{test the}} {{relation}} between price discrimination and product market competition in a two-sided market environment using a new data set of Spanish local TV stations that provides information on subscription and advertising prices per station for 1996, 1999 and 2002. Due to changes in regulation during this period affecting the degree of local market competition, we use differences in concentration across cities and years to investigate {{the relation between}} competition and price discrimination practices in this setting. Consistent with our predictions, {{our findings suggest that}} a U-shaped relation between competition and price discrimination exists, where stations in less com-petitive markets are more likely to price discriminate. Finally, cable subscription fees and advertising prices are higher in more competitive markets which suggests that tougher competition may increase market segmentation through <b>station</b> differentiation, <b>driving</b> <b>stations</b> to charge higher uniform prices to more loyal customers. This may indicate that less price discrimination may be associated with lower consumer surplus in all markets...|$|R

50|$|Bennie learns from villagers {{that his}} assailants are <b>driving</b> a <b>station</b> wagon. He {{catches up with}} the men after they blow out a tire. Bennie shoots them, {{searches}} their car, and claims Garcia's head. Stopping at a roadside restaurant, he packs the sack containing the head with ice to preserve it for the journey home. Bennie begins addressing the head as if Garcia were still alive, first blaming Alfredo for Elita's death and then conceding {{that both of them}} probably loved her equally.|$|R
50|$|Valid {{examples}} of what constitutes as suspicion of carrying illegal aliens include <b>driving</b> a <b>station</b> wagon with fold down seats or spare tires removed to conceal aliens, having a low riding vehicle, having an overly packed vehicle, or driving erratically. Also, the officer's knowledge of the area, experience, and training in dealing with illegal aliens dictates the decision to pursue a search. Thus, an officer must {{have one of these}} articulable facts in order stop someone and question their citizenship.|$|R

50|$|It was {{the markets}} {{dominant}} Top 40 {{station in the}} early 1970s, but in 1975 the station was purchased by New England broadcaster Robert Condit, who controversially changed the format to easy listening and middle-of-the-road standards, angering listeners and <b>driving</b> away the <b>stations</b> on-air staff. The move was a failure, and the format gradually shifted to adult contemporary in the later part of the decade. By 1990, it had become an oldies station. Later the station would switch to an all sports format.|$|R
50|$|Summer/winter semesters {{are offered}} in spring, summer and winter semesters. In summer for four weeks before summer vacation, English, computer, swimming, shooting, <b>driving</b> and police <b>station</b> field {{training}} are offered. In winter, the same training is offered as for summer except for swimming and driving. As for the 4th grade students, the enlistment training is conducted {{in cooperation with the}} Ministry of Defence at the winter semester for male students; and during the same period, female students take executive works at the Police Office or provide social service activities.|$|R
30|$|As seen in Fig.  2, ATS {{is on the}} top level. It {{is always}} put in the command center and stations. Its main {{function}} is to monitor the train running state, use the software to realize the automatic networking, communications, and train operation management. There comes the DCS (Backbone data communication system) [6]. It takes the responsibility of data transmission between ATS and other blocks below. CI {{plays a role in}} controlling and monitoring the fixed block which is composed of annunciators, turnouts, axle counters platform equipment. ATP’s main function is to achieve the train interval control and speed control, and then ensure driving safety. In order to do this, there is a channel for the information transmission between the on-board ATP equipment and ground ATP equipment, which we called Train-to-ground wireless communication system here. ATO in the ground and ATO in the train work together to fulfill automatic <b>driving</b> between <b>stations,</b> speed adjustment, and precise stop inside the stations.|$|R
50|$|On June 25, 1975, two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents Jack R. Coler and Ronald A. Williams who {{had been}} {{investigating}} a case involving stolen cowboy boots followed a car onto the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and were {{shot and killed by}} heavy rifle fire. Leonard Peltier was named by the FBI as a suspect in the case and placed on the agency's List of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. While <b>driving</b> Peltier's <b>station</b> wagon in Kansas several months later, ammunition in the car exploded, seriously injuring Robideau and other AIM members in the car. Robideau was arrested and tried together with Darrelle Dean Butler in a Federal court in Cedar Rapids, Iowa for the killings of the FBI agents and was acquitted. Defense attorney Lewis Gurwitz showed the jury a sacred pipe during opening arguments and stated that the pipe would be kept on the defense table during the trial as a sign that the Native American's religion forbids murder.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop methods for maximizing the {{throughput}} of a mobility-on-demand urban transportation system. We consider a finite group of shared vehicles, located at {{a set of}} stations. Users arrive at the stations, pick-up vehicles, and drive (or are driven) to their destination station where they drop-off the vehicle. When some origins and destinations are more popular than others, the system will inevitably become out of balance: Vehicles will build up at some stations, and become depleted at others. We propose a robotic solution to this rebalancing problem that involves empty robotic vehicles autonomously <b>driving</b> between <b>stations.</b> Specifically, we develop a rebalancing policy that lets every station reach an equilibrium {{in which there are}} excess vehicles and no waiting customers and that minimizes the number of robotic vehicles performing rebalancing trips. To do this, we utilize a fluid model for the customers and vehicles in the system. We then show that the optimal rebalancing policy can be found as the solution to a linear program. We use this solution to develop a real-time rebalancing policy which can operate in highly variable environments. We verify policy performance in a simulated mobility-on-demand environment and in hardware experiments. ...|$|R

Haig, whose relations with Robertson had been deteriorating since at least the Boulogne Conference of September 1917, told Robertson (11 Feb) it was his duty to go to Versailles or anywhere else the government wanted, and advised the King to insist on Robertson going to Versailles. Derby (in Beaverbrook’s phrase “left stranded like a whale on a sandbank”) withdrew his resignation, which Lloyd George permitted on condition he did not resign again.|$|R
