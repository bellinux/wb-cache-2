40|$|In this research, {{operational}} {{problems at}} vehicle <b>inspection</b> <b>centres</b> (VIC) are explored and investigated. Simulation {{is used in}} this new application area to improve operational effectiveness at the VIC. In particular, simulation is used to gain insights, model the interactions of operational activities and experiment with specific operational policies. Critical input random variables corresponding to service times and arrival patterns are modelled based upon empirical data collected at the VIC. Modelling the arrival process involves a thorough analysis of separate patterns of arrival for scheduled and non- scheduled vehicles at a typical VIC. Developing the most appropriate of several ideas, we generate methods for simulating typical streams of arrivals at the VIC. For non- scheduled arrivals, we adopt distinct beta distributions for morning and afternoon activities. For scheduled arrivals, this research demonstrates that customer punctuality varies according to planned appointment times, which leads to an adaptive model for customer punctuality that takes account of these appointment times. Specifically, we construct generalised beta distributions with parameters that evolve over time. In this research, we integrate the design of experiments within our simulation model. In particular, we propose a fractional factorial design matrix to replace traditional ways of planning simulation experiments. Further work involves incorporating blocking into our design matrix, which reduces the experimental size and provides a useful backup support feature for our VIC simulation. The proposed design matrix is then used in the output analysis along with other statistical methods, to determine factors that contribute significantly to specific performance measures. In this study, general linear models that link the control factors and the performance measures are developed. A major contribution {{of this research is}} its impact on simulation modelling, which helps us to characterize more realistic arrival patterns for customers compared with previous research techniques. Additionally, aspects of our research that include experimental design enrich the literature on simulation and modelling particularly in the application of simulation to service shop problems.

40|$|Every year, Finnish dairies reject {{about half}} a million litres of raw milk due to {{suspected}} antimicrobial drug residues discovered in their own checks. This milk cannot be used for human consumption, but is normally used as animal feed. Due to regulations on the way of handling milk by-products (1774 / 2002), in 2003 - 2004 the National Veterinary and Food Research Institute (EELA), {{at the request of}} the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MMM), did a risk assessment on the use of raw milk containing antimicrobial drug residues as feed. This work was done in cooperation with the National Food Agency (NFA) and the Plant Production <b>Inspection</b> <b>Centre</b> (KTTK). Feed containing raw milk rejected due to the suspected presence of antimicrobial substances can contain residues and infectious agents which can be hazardous to animals which eat such feed (and hence also indirectly be hazardous to consumers).

40|$|Sarcocystosis in meat-producing {{animals is}} {{a major cause of}} reduced {{productivity}} in many countries, especially those that rely on agriculture. Although several diagnostic methods are available to detect sarcocystosis, many are too time-consuming for routine use in abattoirs and meat <b>inspection</b> <b>centres,</b> where large numbers of samples need to be tested. Current establish method (transmission electron microscope) for Sarcocystis spp. identification is expensive and time-consuming. Alternatively, tissue compression technique can rapidly detect sarcocysts in tissue samples. Additionally, cysts measurement in corroboration with genotyping of 18 S rDNA allows comprehensive species identification. Sequences of Sarcocystis spp. can also be analysed via phylogenetic tree to provide better understanding of the evolution of Sarcocystis spp. corresponding to the respective intermediate hosts. Furthermore, phylogeny analysis enables effective species differentiation of sarcocyst, especially for those closely related species that are morphologically similar. Tissue samples of cattle and goats were collected from the Shah Alam abattoir, Selangor. Samples were pre-screened for the presence of sarcocysts via tissue compression technique (group of unstained (methylene blue) and stained condition). Positive sample tissues were further confirmed by nested PCR by targeting the 18 S rDNA regions. Statistical calculations were done to determine the efficacy of stain-based technique compared to the standard unstained technique of sarcocysts detection in tissue samples. Besides, sarcocysts detected in tissues were measured for morphometric study and then subjected for genotyping to determine the identity. Sequences were then used for phylogenetic tree analysis. A total of 583 tissue samples were collected. Of these, 245 samples were positive under pre-screening phase. Mc Nemar’s and Cohen kappa analysis show that stain-based technique is able to detect three-folds higher sarcocysts and it is statistically in concordance with nested PCR outcome (gold standard). Morphometric study deduced that possibly one Sarcocystis sp. iv infects cattle whereas two species in goats. Molecular BLAST analysis and morphometric findings confirmed that Sarcocystis cruzi was found in cattle, whereas goats were infected by Sarcocystis capracanis and Sarcocystis tenella. Phylogenetic analysis using nine representative sequences confirmed the identity of the two species, in addition of S. tenella where the corresponding sequences were separated from the reference gene and formed a subclade. All Sarcocystis spp. found shared dog as a definitive host. Dogs are often used in cattle farms to monitor the herds. Poor management in the farmlands potentially boosts up the dynamics of disease transmission between the hosts. The “S. tenella-like”, maybe refers to Sarcocystis hircicanis rather than S. tenella where it also uses dogs as a definitive host. Insufficient or lack of the gene information of S. hircicanis in the GenBank explains the failure of BLAST to match the 18 S rDNA of the Sarcocystis sp. with S. hircicanis...|$|R

In 1989 a grant from Brighton and Hove City Council, then Brighton Council, enabled the Centre to secure its own premises. The Centre moved 12 years later to the Brighthelm Community Centre, and finally, in 2006, arrived at its present location in High Street, Kemptown. [...] In 1992 the Centre set up a registered crèche called ToyBox, to offer childcare to mothers in temporary bed and breakfast accommodation and where the children were suffering deprivation through low income, language barriers or both. In 2003 the crèche was renamed the ToyBox Pre-School and since 2000 has provided places in partnership with the Sure Start initiative and is registered for Ofsted <b>inspection.</b> Brighton Women's <b>Centre</b> effectively became a nursery for the development of other women's organisations in the city, namely Brighton Oasis Project and the Women’s Refuge Project (now Rise).

40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Dept. of Building Economics for the degree of Master of Science in Project Management. CD-ROM IncludedProject Management constraints and operationalisation dimensions of Vehicle Emission Testing (VET) program Urban air pollution was becoming an issue in Sri Lanka especially towards late 1990 ’s. It was evident that the transport sector was the largest contributor to the overall total emissions for all pollutants. Analysis of air quality data had suggested the ever increasing vehicle fleetas the major culprit. Poor vehicle maintenance, absence of a system to monitor, control and regulate vehicular emissions, and low quality fuels contributed towards increased emissions from vehicles. Therefore, government intervention was required to reverse the trend of deteriorating air quality and mitigate the accompanying adverse health effects caused by exposure to fine particles, lead and other vehicular emissions. With the roles, responsibilities and expertise dispersed within several organizations, to curb air pollution, in year 2001, created Air Resource Management Center (AirMAC) : a multistakeholder organization as a strong partnership institution linking all stakeholder agencies. AirMAC initiated Vehicle Emission Testing (VET) to monitor and control level of emission generated by vehicles in Sri Lanka in 2008. The main sponsoring body of the VET programme is Ministry of Environment in Sri Lanka. This {{study was conducted to}} determine critical constraints to the effective implementation of VET programme in Sri Lanka, particularly from a project management perspective. Its strengths and weaknesses are analysed to propose ways and means to improve its effectiveness and efficiency in the long term. The key findings of this case study categorized under 3 main development areas. The policy measures area includes programme administration, and financial mechanism of VET Trust Fund and has identified several planning and executing issues. Stakeholders’ goals and rewards areas how clear communication gaps and problems with stakeholders’ participation. In the benchmarking and standardization aspects of the VET programme during the monitoring and controlling phases were found several issues arising due to creation of competition, weakness of data and software management, lack of a roadside vehicle emission testing programme, VET <b>centre</b> <b>inspection</b> programme, non-implementation of liquidated damages or penalties for breach of test procedureand so on. For the improvement of the VET programme the recommendations addressing the three important areas organizational changers, better project management practices and the enhance role of the sponsor of management could be followed as the management practices.
