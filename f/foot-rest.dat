Some scholars interpret the Alexamenos graffito, the earliest surviving depiction of the Crucifixion, as including such a <b>foot-rest.</b> Ancient sources also mention the sedile, a small seat {{attached to}} the front of the cross, about halfway down, which could have served a similar purpose.|$|E

As early as 1940 some German aircraft had <b>foot-rests</b> above the rudder pedals so that the pilot's feet and legs could be raised during combat {{in an attempt to}} minimize the negative effects of high speed turns. Large rudder deflections were often not necessary during such manoeuvres, but being able to cut inside the opponent's turning radius was.|$|R

40|$|The {{sanitary}} status (presence {{or absence}} of rhinitis, mastitis, sore hocks and mange) and body condition (BC) of 3751 lactating does was evaluated {{on an individual basis}} to: a) analyse the influence of the “sanitary status ” factor in lactating does on their body condition, and b) estimate the influence of BC on the sanitary status of does. The body condition scoring (BCS) was evaluated by palpating and estimating the fullness of muscle and fat of the lumbar, sacral, coxal tuberosity and gluteal regions, in relation {{to the size of the}} animal, on a lineal scale of 1 to 9. Prevalence of the diseases was 19. 48 % coryza, 4. 34 % mastitis, 5. 46 % sore hocks and 4. 13 % mange. An ANOVA was used to evaluate the effect of sanitary status on the BCS, the following factors being significant: rhinitis, mastitis, sore hocks, number of kindling, partum-AI interval, lactation stage and farm. The presence of rhinitis, mastitis and sore hocks caused the BCS to decrease by 6 %, 7 % and 7 %, respectively (P< 0. 001). Therefore, all possible measures must be taken to reduce the prevalence of these diseases in farms. The method of maximum likelihood (CATMOD procedure) was used to estimate the analysis of the factors of variation affecting each disease. The factors that were significant for some of the diseases were: farm, BC, reproductive rhythm, number of kindling, phase of lactation, season and use of <b>foot-rests.</b> The use of <b>foot-rests</b> reduces the prevalence of sore hocks by over 50 %. The BCS is a good indicator of health in does, and is thus a criterion in farm management...|$|R
60|$|Ever {{since he}} began to follow the {{occupation}} of a bootblack, Carrots had desired to own such an outfit as was {{in the possession of}} a certain Italian on Centre Street. In his eyes it was simply magnificent. A chair, upholstered in red velvet, stood on a platform covered with sheet brass and studded plentifully with large-headed nails of the same metal. As <b>foot-rests</b> there were two deformed camels in bronzed iron, each bearing on its back a piece of iron fashioned {{in the shape of the}} sole of a boot. Even in his wildest dreams, however, he had never allowed himself to believe it was possible for him to become the owner of such a gorgeous establishment; for he had learned from a reliable source that the Italian's outfit had cost not less than twenty dollars--an amount which, in Carrots's eyes, was so large as to be within reach of only the very wealthy.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Minot {{liked to}} have him with her sons, because they also were to paddle their own canoes by and by, and she {{believed}} that, rich or poor, boys make better men for learning to use the talents they possess, not merely as ornaments, but tools with which to carve their own fortunes; and the best help toward this end {{is an example of}} faithful work, high aims, and honest living. So Ralph came often, and in times of trouble was a real rainy-day friend. Jack grew very fond of him during his imprisonment, for the good youth ran in every evening to get commissions, amuse the boy with droll accounts of the day's adventures, or invent lifts, bed-tables, and <b>foot-rests</b> for the impatient invalid. Frank found him a sure guide through the mechanical mysteries which he loved, and spent many a useful half-hour discussing cylinders, pistons, valves, and balance-wheels. Jill also came in for her share of care and comfort; the poor little back lay all the easier for the air-cushion Ralph got her, and the weary headaches found relief from the spray atomizer, which softly distilled its scented dew on the hot forehead till she fell asleep.|$|R

40|$|Activities {{of daily}} living (ADL) often pose {{significant}} difficulty for physically challenged people. Inability to perform certain ADLs independently viz. toileting, bathing and personal hygiene, can affect an individual's privacy, dignity and self-esteem. Use of sanitary napkins is essential for women in child-bearing age; but, it involves significant dexterity and coordinated use of the two hands. An woman whose one hand is dysfunctional, viz. amputees, stroke-induced hemiplegia or congenital disorder, would {{find it difficult to}} do or seek help for. Even advanced prosthetic devices may not help the amputees much, and stroke rehabilitation is a long process. Therefore, a design intervention is imperative to save the dignity of such members with special needs in our society. The proposed design enables subjects with one functional hand to use a common sanitary napkin with a sticky patch for attaching it to knickers. It is basically a structure with two <b>foot-rests</b> and a raised portion in the middle for supporting the central narrow region of lowering knickers, and placing the opened pad for pressing and sticking. The same device also aids in removing, rolling and wrapping the used napkin with one hand. The design is sized to accommodate different anthropometry and napkin sizes. The effectiveness of the device has been teste...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} was to examine the role of the upper and lower body on the dynamic phenomena, which precede the {{voluntary}} movement (anticipatory postural adjustments: APAs), {{and the way in which}} they contribute to postural control. In this view, sitting subjects were asked to perform horizontal two-handed ramp pushes as quickly as possible. A dynamometric bar was used to provide the push force (F(x)). Local reaction forces along the antero-posterior and vertical axes, at the seat and <b>foot-rests</b> (R(Sx), R(Sz), and R(fx), R(fz), respectively), as well as global ones (R(x) and R(z)), were measured. Two postural conditions were considered: full (100 BP) and one-third ischio-femoral contact (30 BP). Anticipatory postural adjustments durations (dAPAs) were measured between the onset of global or local (that is, at the seat and foot level) reaction forces, and the onset of push force increase. Firstly, the dAPAs were longer at the foot than at the seat level, that is, the APA sequence starts at the foot level: it is suggested that a "posturo-focal" sequence is followed, whose progression order is precisely dependent on the postural conditions. Moreover, the APA peak amplitudes (pAPA), measured at the seat contact were significantly greater than the corresponding ones measured at the foot contact: the upper body dynamics are larger than the lower body dynamics. Secondly, a greater peak push force (pF(x)) entailed significant dAPA increases, in preference to pAPA increases. As APAs are dynamic phenomena, they can perturb balance, suggesting that, in order to avoid unnecessary perturbation, APAs are increased in terms of duration rather than amplitude. Lastly, the impulses corresponding to the push force increase ("BPI(x) ") and to the APA periods ("ACPI(x) ") were calculated. As ACPI(x) was very low as compared to BPI(x), it was suggested that the APA action was limited to the period of the voluntary movement onset...|$|R

60|$|Idly Walter {{allowed his}} eyes to wander over {{the walls of his}} den. It was a snug little room, simply {{furnished}} with a spring cot, which was a bed by night and a couch by day, a desk, a deep-cushioned Morris chair, a revolving desk chair, a <b>foot-rest</b> and two well filled bookcases. The walls were covered with photographs. Nearly all of them were of outdoor scenes, most of them of his own taking, for he was an expert with the camera. A number were enlargements neatly framed. Among these was the famous flashlight made during his first summer at Woodcraft Camp which had furnished the evidence to put Red Pete, the outlaw and poacher, behind the bars. There, too, were the splendid portraits (they were nothing less) of the bull moose of Swift River, a lasting tribute to the nerve of Plympton, the tenderfoot comrade of that memorable cruise.|$|E

60|$|A draught of air, fanned from {{forward by}} {{the speed of the}} ship, passed {{steadily}} through the long gloom between the high bulwarks, swept over the rows of prone bodies; a few dim flames in globe-lamps were hung short here and there under the ridge-poles, and in the blurred circles of light thrown down and trembling slightly to the unceasing vibration of the ship appeared a chin upturned, two closed eyelids, a dark hand with silver rings, a meagre limb draped in a torn covering, a head bent back, a naked foot, a throat bared and stretched as if offering itself to the knife. The well-to-do had made for their families shelters with heavy boxes and dusty mats; the poor reposed side by side with all they had on earth tied up in a rag under their heads; the lone old men slept, with drawn-up legs, upon their prayer-carpets, with their hands over their ears and one elbow {{on each side of the}} face; a father, his shoulders up and his knees under his forehead, dozed dejectedly by a boy who slept on his back with tousled hair and one arm commandingly extended; a woman covered from head to foot, like a corpse, with a piece of white sheeting, had a naked child in the hollow of each arm; the Arab's belongings, piled right aft, made a heavy mound of broken outlines, with a cargo-lamp swung above, and a great confusion of vague forms behind: gleams of paunchy brass pots, the <b>foot-rest</b> of a deck-chair, blades of spears, the straight scabbard of an old sword leaning against a heap of pillows, the spout of a tin coffee-pot. The patent log on the taffrail periodically rang a single tinkling stroke for every mile traversed on an errand of faith. Above the mass of sleepers a faint and patient sigh at times floated, the exhalation of a troubled dream; and short metallic clangs bursting out suddenly in the depths of the ship, the harsh scrape of a shovel, the violent slam of a furnace-door, exploded brutally, as if the men handling the mysterious things below had their breasts full of fierce anger: while the slim high hull of the steamer went on evenly ahead, without a sway of her bare masts, cleaving continuously the great calm of the waters under the inaccessible serenity of the sky.|$|E
