25|$|Disruption of {{hedgehog}} signaling during embryonic development, through either deleterious mutation or {{consumption of}} teratogens by the gestating mother, {{can lead to}} severe developmental abnormalities. <b>Holoprosencephaly,</b> {{the failure of the}} embryonic prosencephalon to divide to form cerebral hemispheres, occurs with a frequency of about 1 in 8,000 live births and about 1 in 200 spontaneous abortions in humans and is commonly linked to mutations in genes involved in the hedgehog pathway, including SHH and PTCH. Cyclopia, one of the most severe defects of <b>holoprosencephaly,</b> results if the pathway inhibitor cyclopamine is consumed by gestating mammals.|$|E

25|$|Congenital {{anomalies}} of {{the nervous}} system include neural tube defects such as spina bifida, meningocele, meningomyelocele, encephalocele and anencephaly. Other congenital anomalies {{of the nervous}} system include the Arnold-Chiari malformation, the Dandy-Walker malformation, hydrocephalus, microencephaly, megalencephaly, lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, <b>holoprosencephaly,</b> and agenesis of the corpus callosum.|$|E
25|$|Of the hh homologues, SHH {{has been}} found to have the most {{critical}} roles in development, acting as a morphogen involved in patterning many systems, including the limb and midline structures in the brain, spinal cord, the thalamus by the zona limitans intrathalamica the lungs, and the teeth. Mutations in the human sonic hedgehog gene, SHH, cause <b>holoprosencephaly</b> type 3 HPE3 {{as a result of the}} loss of the ventral midline. Sonic hedgehog is secreted at the zone of polarizing activity, which is located on the posterior side of a limb bud in an embryo. The sonic hedgehog transcription pathway has also been linked to the formation of specific kinds of cancerous tumors, including the embryonic cerebellar tumor, and medulloblastoma, as well as the progression of Prostate Cancer tumours. For SHH to be expressed in the developing embryo limbs, a morphogen called fibroblast growth factors must be secreted from the apical ectodermal ridge.|$|E
25|$|Sonic {{hedgehog}} (SHH) is a signaling molecule that is encoded by {{the same}} gene sonic hedgehog. SHH plays very important role in organogenesis and most importantly craniofacial development. Being that SHH is a signaling molecule it primarily works by diffusion along a concentration gradient affecting cells in different manners. In early tooth development, SHH is released from the primary enamel knot, a signaling center, to provide positional information in both a lateral and planar signaling pattern in tooth development and regulation of tooth cusp growth. SHH in particular is needed for growth of epithelial cervical loops, where the outer and inner epitheliums join and form a reservoir for dental stem cells. After the primary enamel knots are apoptosed, the secondary enamel knots are formed. The secondary enamel knots secrete SHH {{in combination with other}} signaling molecules to thicken the oral ectoderm and begin patterning the complex shapes of the crown of a tooth during differentiation and mineralization. In a knockout gene model, absence of SHH is indicative of <b>holoprosencephaly.</b> However SHH activates downstream molecules of Gli2 & Gli3. Mutant Gli2 and Gli3 embryos have abnormal development of incisors that are arrested at early in tooth development as well as small molars.|$|E
2500|$|The gene {{has been}} linked to a {{condition}} known as <b>holoprosencephaly,</b> which can result in severe brain, skull and facial defects, possibly causing clinicians and scientists to criticize the name on grounds of it sounding too frivolous. A less humorous situation where patients or parents of patients with a serious disorder could be told that they or their child [...] "have a mutation in their sonic hedgehog".|$|E
50|$|TGIF-Mutations and deletions of {{this gene}} have been {{associated}} with <b>holoprosencephaly.</b> Penetrance is incomplete, meaning that a deletion of one copy of this gene is not in and of itself sufficient to cause <b>holoprosencephaly.</b> Ten to fifteen percent of people with 18p- have <b>holoprosencephaly,</b> suggesting that other genetic and environmental facts {{play a role in the}} etiology of <b>holoprosencephaly</b> in these individuals.|$|E
50|$|In some {{children}} without “classic” <b>holoprosencephaly,</b> microforms of <b>holoprosencephaly</b> may be noted on MRI, including missing olfactory tracts and bulbs and absent or hypoplastic corpus callosum.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the causes}} of most cases of <b>holoprosencephaly</b> remain unknown, some {{may be due to}} {{dominant}} or chromosome causes. Such chromosomal anomalies as trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 have been found in association with <b>holoprosencephaly,</b> or other neural tube defects. Genetic counseling and genetic testing, such as amniocentesis, is usually offered during a pregnancy if <b>holoprosencephaly</b> is detected. The recurrence risk depends on the underlying cause. If no cause is identified and the fetal chromosomes are normal, the chance to have another pregnancy affected with <b>holoprosencephaly</b> is about 6%.|$|E
5000|$|Lobar <b>holoprosencephaly,</b> {{in which}} there is {{considerable}} evidence of separate brain hemispheres, is the least severe form. In some cases of lobar <b>holoprosencephaly,</b> the patient's brain may be nearly normal.|$|E

50|$|There is no {{treatment}} for <b>holoprosencephaly</b> and the prognosis {{for individuals with}} the disorder is poor. Most of those who survive show no significant developmental gains. For children who survive, treatment is symptomatic. It is possible that improved management of diabetic pregnancies may help prevent <b>holoprosencephaly,</b> however there is no means of primary prevention.|$|E
50|$|Increases in {{expression}} of such genes as Pax-2, {{as well as}} inhibition of Pax-6, from the notochord have been implicated in normal differentiation of cephalic midline structures. Inappropriate {{expression of}} any of these genes may result in mild to severe forms of <b>holoprosencephaly.</b> Other candidate genes have been located, including the SHH (<b>holoprosencephaly</b> type 3 a.k.a.

This is the first gene that has been definitively shown to directly cause a clinical phenotype when deleted. If a deletion includes the TCF4 gene (located at 52,889,562-52,946,887), features of Pitt-Hopkins may be present, including abnormal corpus callosum; short neck; small penis; accessory and wide-spaced nipples; broad or clubbed fingers; and sacral dimple. Those with deletions inclusive of TCF4 have a significantly more severe cognitive phenotype.|$|E

50|$|CDON {{mutations}} {{are thought}} to diminish sonic hedgehog (SHH)-pathway activity {{which is important}} in stimulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue patterning at multiple points in animal development. CDON was shown {{to play a role}} in differentiation of midbrain dopaminergic neurons through the interference with of Shh signaling pathway. Mutations in CDON gene has been associated with <b>Holoprosencephaly</b> which is structural anomaly of the brain, in which the developing forebrain fails to correctly separate into right and left hemispheres. CDON mutations synergistically interact with prenatal alcohol exposure to increase susceptibility to <b>Holoprosencephaly.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{condition}} can be mild or severe. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), [...] "in {{most cases}} of <b>holoprosencephaly,</b> the malformations are {{so severe that}} babies die before birth." ...|$|E

5000|$|Correct {{function}} of these proteins {{is critical for}} early development, and as such mutations of the genes encoding these proteins is known to result in various congenital defects. For example, mutation of ZIC2 is known to result in <b>holoprosencephaly</b> due to defect in the {{function of}} the organizer region (node), which leads to a defective anterior notochord (ANC). The ANC provides a maintenance signal to the Prechordal plate (PCP), thus a defective ANC results in degradation of the PCP, which is normally responsible for sending a shh signal to the developing forebrain resulting {{in the formation of the}} two hemispheres. [...] <b>Holoprosencephaly</b> is the most common structural anomaly of the human forebrain.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in SIX3 are {{the cause}} of a severe brain malformation, called <b>holoprosencephaly</b> type 2 (HPE2).
