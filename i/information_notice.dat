25|$|By April 2010, {{following}} on {{from the}} response to its consultation at end of 2009 the communications regulator ComReg issued an <b>Information</b> <b>Notice</b> on the future award of a mobile television license, ComReg 10/26 Mobile TV Wireless Telegraphy Licence Award on Tuesday, 30 March 2010.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Information</b> <b>Notice</b> {{provided}} in ComReg's plans to issue one 8MHz frequency channel in the UHF {{band in the}} areas of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick, and Waterford and invited candidates to tender for the licence {{in the fourth quarter of}} the year of 2010 and announce the licence results by the end of 2010. It weighed elements of business plans when it began the comparative process in Q4 2010. Offer of licence would have been 2011 but this was then cancelled by ComReg. International frequency co-ordination would also be ongoing during the period primarily with the UK.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{accident}} oil companies and helicopter operators voluntarily grounded similar helicopters until further notice, except for aircraft being used for search and rescue purposes. This was later followed by a grounding by the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway, specified to public transport flights and commercial air transport operations with EC225LP helicopters. Later that day the British Civil Aviation Authority issued a Safety Directive which grounded all EC225LP helicopters on the United Kingdom Civil Aircraft Register, or flying in United Kingdom airspace, except for aircraft being used for search and rescue purposes. On 30 April, Airbus Helicopters issued a Safety <b>Information</b> <b>Notice</b> expressing their support {{of the decision to}} put all commercial passenger flights with Super Puma helicopters of model EC225LP [...] "on hold".

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this generic aging lessons learned (GALL) review {{is to provide a}} {{systematic}} review of plant aging information in order to assess materials and component aging issues related to continued operation and license renewal of operating reactors. Literature on mechanical, structural, and thermal-hydraulic components and systems reviewed consisted of 97 Nuclear Plant Aging Research (NPAR) reports, 23 NRC Generic Letters, 154 <b>Information</b> <b>Notices,</b> 29 Licensee Event Reports (LERs), 4 Bulletins, and 9 Nuclear Management and Resources Council Industry Reports (NUMARC IRs) and literature on electrical components and systems reviewed consisted of 66 NPAR reports, 8 NRC Generic Letters, 111 <b>Information</b> <b>Notices,</b> 53 LERs, 1 Bulletin, and 1 NUMARC IR. More than 550 documents were reviewed. The results of these reviews were systematized using a standardized GALL tabular format and standardized definitions of aging-related degradation mechanisms and effects. The tables are included in volume s 1 and 2 of this report. A computerized data base has also been developed for all review tables and can be used to expedite the search for desired information on structures, components, and relevant aging effects. A survey of the GALL tables reveals that all ongoing significant component aging issues are currently being addressed by the regulatory process. However, the aging of what are termed passive components has been highlighted for continued scrutiny. This document is Volume 1, consisting of the executive summary, summary and observations, and an appendix listing the GALL literature review tables...|$|R

50|$|This {{requirement}} {{was then}} {{communicated to the}} market in a market sounding exercise {{in the form of}} a 'call for innovation and information', designed and managed by the EIAG FCP team. (Market sounding is a way of “assessing the reaction of the market to a proposed requirement and procurement approach, in order to bring supplier perspectives to public sector procurements at an early stage”. This exercise involved the publication of a Prior <b>Information</b> <b>Notice</b> in the Official Journal of the European Union and the engagement of intermediaries, such as the BERR funded Knowledge Transfer Networks, trade bodies and similar, to communicate notification of the call to the potential supply chain.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{formally}} tendering a specific franchise, the DfT publishes a Prior <b>Information</b> <b>Notice</b> (PIN) outlining the basic details, and opens a consultation with relevant transport authorities, devolved administrations and Passenger Focus. At {{the end of}} this process, a formal Invitation To Tender (ITT) setting out the detailed terms of the proposed franchise agreement is sent to the three to five prospective bidders who have been identified as pre-qualified. ITT's may include a range of variations for the prospective bidder to consider, and in addition, they may also submit variations themselves. The franchise is awarded to the bid which is deemed most viable, and which offers the best value and reliability. If relevant, bidders past performance is also considered.|$|E
