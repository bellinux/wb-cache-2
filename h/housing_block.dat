500|$|The fraternal {{organisation}} {{was founded}} {{in the town of}} Annemasse, Haute-Savoie in eastern France in 1956. The 1901 French law of Associations required that the Priory of Sion be registered with the government; although the statutes and the registration documents are dated 7 May 1956, the registration took place at the subprefecture of Saint-Julien-en-Genevois on 25 June 1956 and this was announced in the Journal Officiel de la République Française on 20 July 1956. The Headquarters of the Priory of Sion and its journal Circuit were based in the apartment of Plantard, in a social <b>housing</b> <b>block</b> known as Sous-Cassan newly constructed in 1956. The founders and signatories inscribed with their real names and aliases were Pierre Plantard, also known as [...] "Chyren", and André Bonhomme, also known as [...] "Stanis Bellas". Bonhomme was the President while Plantard was the Secretary General. [...] The registration documents also included the names of Jean Deleaval as the Vice-President and Armand Defago as the Treasurer. The offices of the Priory of Sion and its journal Circuit were located at Plantard's apartment. The choice of the name [...] "Sion" [...] was based on a popular local feature, a hill south of Annemasse in France, known as Mont Sion, where the founders intended to establish a retreat center. The accompanying title to the name was [...] "Chevalerie d'Institutions et Règles Catholiques d'Union Indépendante et Traditionaliste": this subtitle forms the acronym CIRCUIT and translates in English as Chivalry of Catholic Rules and Institutions of Independent and Traditionalist Union".|$|E

2500|$|One {{month before}} filing the Palace of Labor, Leonid Vesnin {{presented}} his drafts of a <b>housing</b> <b>block,</b> marked by clever rational floorplans but otherwise fairly conventional. This fact, {{and the existence}} of early Palace of Labor sketches drawn by Alexander Vesnin are, according to Khan-Magomedov, evidence that the Palace was primarily inspired by Alexander. Catherine Cooke arrived at the same conclusion by examining Alexander's elaborate stage set for Alexander Tairov's production of The Man Who Was Thursday: the layout of the Palace, according to Cooke, was directly based on Alexander's earlier [...] "fantastic conception". Cheredina, on the contrary, noted that Victor Vesnin's own industrial drafts of 1922 were just as important in shaping the Vesnin brothers' collaborative style.|$|E
