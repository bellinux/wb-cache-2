60|$|The frost soon broke up, and it {{was raining}} heavily one afternoon, when the boys were at work in an {{excavation}} they had driven under a big fir stump shortly after their shooting trip. Frank, very wet and dirty, lay propped up on one elbow with his head and shoulders inside the hole, chopping awkwardly at a root. His legs and feet were {{in a pool of}} water outside and there was very little room to swing the ax, while at every blow the saturated soil fell down on him. <b>Grubbing</b> <b>out</b> a stump in wet weather is a singularly disagreeable task.|$|E

Well, I have some money laid by as well as my royalties, and I'm undertaking a few machinery agencies, and starting as mill expert in Vancouver.

60|$|Reaching the ranch, Geoffrey possessed {{himself of}} a grub-hoe, {{which is a}} pick with an adz-shaped blade with an ax and shovel; also he {{returned}} with the girls to the boulder. For {{an hour or two}} he toiled hard, <b>grubbing</b> <b>out</b> hundredweights of soil and gravel from round about the rock. Then cutting a young fir he inserted the butt of it as a lever, and spent another thirty minutes focusing his full strength on the opposite end. The rock, however, refused to move an inch, and, because a few crackers are not much for a hungry man to work on after an all-night march, Thurston became conscious that he had a headache and a distressful stitch in his side. Still, being obstinate and filled with an unreasoning desire to prove his trustworthiness to his fair employer, he continued doggedly, and after another hour's digging found the stone still immovable. Then it happened that while, with the perspiration dripping from him, he tugged at the lever, the rancher who had rebuffed him that morning, drew rein close beside.|$|E

50|$|The term ‘assart’ {{was also}} used for a parcel of land assarted. Assart rents were those paid to the British Crown for the forest lands assarted.

He was only 15 but was required to do a man’s job tending the vineyards, clearing land and <b>grubbing</b> <b>out</b> the notorious York Road poison plant (Gastrolobium calycinum). He learnt valuable skills from his father about how to handle stock {{and everything to do with}} managing the winery. However life during the war years was not all hard work.

40|$|The monthly evening {{meeting was}} held on Tuesday, the llth May, M. Allport, Esq., V.

Peacock, of Sorell, presented to the Museum the beautiful specimen of the Nankeen Kestrel(Tinnimcidus cenchrokles) now before you. Tasmania is not given as a habitat of this charming hawk by Gould, and {{this is probably the}} first instance of its presence here being publicly recorded, though I find another specimen in the Museum labelled from Clarence Plains, and presented by Mr. Luckman in April, 1873. " -Includes a letter from Edward Swan about "Reed Warblers (Calamoherpe Atistralis) that had taken up their quarters among a bed of reeds {{on the banks of the}} North Esk, near Launceston. -A letter from Mr. A. K. Chapman, addressed to the secretary, was read. The following is an extract : — "Sir,—I have the honour to bring under the notice of the Royal Society the desirability of some steps being taken to restore the rapidly diminishing stock of our most valuable timber tree, the blue gum (Euacalyptus globulus). The Secretary, after reminding the meeting that the Society on a former occasion had addressed the Government on the subject of the improvement of the Domain, mentioned that Mr. P. T. Smith had recently taken a warm interest in the matter and had lately requested a visitor to the colony, who was versed in matters of the kind, to inspect the Domain with a view to giving such hints towards possible improvements as he might think necessary. -Mr. Barnard highly approved of the proposed <b>grubbing</b> <b>out</b> of all diseased and unsightly trees, and thought the sale of the wood would repay the cost. He deprecated any idea, however, of making the Domain too artificial in its features. -Mr. Grant suggested if Government was asked for permission to allow the Superintendent of the Society's Gardens to undertake the work, it would be granted at once. Private subscriptions might be got up for the expense of fencing, and the whole might be under the direction of a committee chosen from the Council. Mr. Rule thought the suggestion might be acted on, and proposed that Mr. P. T. Smith, Mr. M. Allport, Mr. Stephens, and Dr. Agnew be appointed as the committee...|$|E

50|$|Other {{items such}} as bog-wood and <b>grubbed</b> <b>out</b> tree stumps were {{sometimes}} added to the cairns {{as a result of}} tree felling and the process of creation of pasture from woodland. Bog-wood stumps and trunks can be thousands of years old, are darker in colour due to the tannins from the peat and do not show typical wood decomposition characteristics due to their preservation within peat bogs. The absence of saw marks indicates felling using axes, providing further information about the age of the wood involved.|$|R
5000|$|Cheddar Wood and {{the smaller}} Macall's Wood near Cheddar Gorge are {{what remains of the}} wood of the Bishops of Bath and Wells in the thirteenth century and of King Edmund the Magnificent's wood in the tenth. It lies on {{carboniferous}} limestone with rock showing through the thin topsoils. In 1801 the wood was larger than it is today. During the nineteenth century its lower fringes were <b>grubbed</b> <b>out</b> to make strawberry fields, most of which have reverted to woodland. It was coppiced until 1917.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it's {{a family}} failing I guess, {{for his father}} did the same, only he began with his farm and let the roads alone. The land used to be pretty much all rocks up here, you know, and farmers had to clear the ground if they wanted crops. It was a hard fight, and took a sight of time and {{patience}} to <b>grub</b> <b>out</b> roots and blast rocks and pick up stones that seemed to grow faster than anything else.

The field boundaries of Hanwell, (the hedges of which, have since been mostly <b>grubbed</b> <b>out),</b> were roughly of the same measurements and orientation of the Roman 'limes' or land divisions. Even more tantalizing he observed: that at exactly the north east corner stood the gate and path of Perivale's parish church of St. Mary's.

5000|$|At {{the age of}} puberty, or {{just before}} a Peramangk boy was {{introduced}} to the intermediate stage of life.

Surrounded by elder men and women of his family the boy is first gently beaten with new growth branches of eucalyptus leaves. Then grabbed by his elders the boy was placed on a bed of gum leaves and one of the senior men would make cuts on his own arm allowing the blood to cover the whole body. Once this stage was completed the boy was allowed to carry a wirri for killing birds, and a small wooden spade (karko) for digging <b>grubs</b> <b>out</b> of the ground.|$|R

2500|$|Aye-ayes tap on {{the trunks}} and {{branches}} of trees {{at a rate of}} up to eight times per second, and listen to the echo produced to find hollow chambers. Studies have suggested that the acoustic properties associated with the foraging cavity have no effect on excavation behavior. Once a chamber is found, they chew a hole into the wood and get <b>grubs</b> <b>out</b> of that hole with their highly adapted narrow and bony middle fingers. The aye-aye begins foraging between 30 minutes before and three hours after sunset. Up to 80% of the night is spent foraging in the canopy, separated by occasional rest periods. It climbs trees by making successive vertical leaps, much like a squirrel. Horizontal movement is more difficult, but the aye-aye rarely descends to jump to another tree, and can often travel up to [...] a night.|$|R
