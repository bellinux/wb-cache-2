40|$|Abstract- <b>Dual</b> motor <b>drives</b> {{designs are}} {{attractive}} for high power application {{because of their}} mechanical simplicity, traction and regenerative braking control on low friction surfaces. However, such configurations normally require two power inverters with coordinated control. The high cost and large size of packaging needs of the inverters make such dual inverter, <b>dual</b> motor <b>drive</b> configurations are economically less competitive. Therefore, the need for <b>dual</b> motor <b>drives</b> fed by single inverter rising consequently to reduce sizes and costs {{with respect to the}} single motor drives, either in industrial or in traction application. This paper aims to investigate the behavior of <b>dual</b> motor <b>drives</b> fed by single inverter using averaging technique MATLAB/Simulink has been chosen as the simulation tools...|$|R

2500|$|DeLorean's time at Chrysler lasted {{less than}} a year, ending when he was offered a US$14,000 salary at Packard Motor Company under {{supervision}} of noted engineer Forest McFarland. DeLorean quickly gained the attention of his new employer with an improvement to the Ultramatic automatic transmission, giving it an improved torque converter and <b>dual</b> <b>drive</b> ranges; it was launched as the [...] "Twin-Ultramatic".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Dual</b> <b>drive</b> {{systems were}} widely used since the {{earliest}} days of tracked vehicles, including the Holt 75 tractor that saw widespread use in World War I. The Japanese adopted the concept in 1925, and all their subsequent tanks through World War II used this. The British also continued to use it on light tanks like [...] the Covenanter and Crusader of the early war period. The Czech LTH also adopted the system, seeing service with the Germans as the Panzer 38(t).|$|E

50|$|Because {{of their}} {{multiple}} uses, slewing drives {{come in a}} variety of model sizes, performance ranges and mounting characteristics. The drives are well suited for applications that require both load holding and rotational torque from the same gear box. They can also be made with dual axes of rotation, (turning axes at the same time) or with <b>dual</b> <b>drives</b> on the same axis, (two worm threads driving the same ring gear in one axis).|$|R
50|$|Commodore {{announced}} at the 1985 Consumer Electronics Show a dual-drive version of the 1571, {{to be called the}} Commodore 1572, but quickly canceled it, reportedly due to technical difficulties with the 1572 DOS. It would have had four times as much RAM as the 1571 (8 kB), and twice as much ROM (64 kB). The 1572 would have allowed for fast disk backups of non-copy-protected media, much like the old 4040, 8050, and 8250 <b>dual</b> <b>drives.</b>|$|R

50|$|Though most {{hub gear}} systems use one rear sprocket, SRAM's <b>Dual</b> <b>Drive</b> system {{combines}} an epicyclic hub with a multi-speed rear derailleur system {{to provide a}} wide-ranging drivetrain concentrated at the rear wheel.

50|$|The 1541's {{numerous}} shortcomings {{opened a}} market {{for a number of}} third-party clones of the disk drive, a situation that continued for the lifetime of the C64.
