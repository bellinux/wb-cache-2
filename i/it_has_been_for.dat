25|$|The peak of {{traditional}} English folk, like progressive and electric folk, was the mid- to late-1970s, when, {{for a time}} it threatened to break through into the mainstream. By {{the end of the}} decade, however, it was in decline. The attendance at, and numbers of folk clubs began to decrease, probably as new musical and social trends, including punk rock, new wave and electronic music began to dominate. Although many acts like Martin Carthy and the Watersons continued to perform successfully, there were very few significant new acts pursuing traditional forms in the 1980s. This began to change with a new generation in the 1990s. The arrival and sometimes mainstream success of acts like Kate Rusby, Bellowhead, Nancy Kerr, Kathryn Tickell, Jim Moray, Spiers and Boden, Seth Lakeman, Frank Turner, Laura Marling and Eliza Carthy, all largely concerned with acoustic performance {{of traditional}} material, marked a radical turn around in the fortunes of the tradition. This was reflected in the adoption creation of the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2000, which gave the music a much needed status and focus and the profile of folk music is as high in England today as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> over thirty years.|$|E

[...] After the season was over, Coach Kipke also credited the play of Everhardus and his ends for the undefeated season: [...] "Our ends, Ward and Petoskey, were near perfection."
