5|$|The phylogenetic {{position}} of Diptera has been controversial. The monophyly of <b>holometabolous</b> insects {{has long been}} accepted, with the main orders being established as Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera, {{and it is the}} relationships between these groups which has caused difficulties. Diptera is widely thought {{to be a member of}} Mecopterida, along with Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Trichoptera (caddisflies), Siphonaptera (fleas), Mecoptera (scorpionflies) and possibly Strepsiptera (twisted-wing flies). Diptera has been grouped with Siphonaptera and Mecoptera in the Antliophora, but this has not been confirmed by molecular studies.|$|E
5|$|Fleas are <b>holometabolous</b> insects, {{going through}} the four {{lifecycle}} stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). In most species, neither female nor male fleas are fully mature when they first emerge but must feed on blood before they become capable of reproduction. The first blood meal triggers the maturation of the ovaries in females and {{the dissolution of the}} testicular plug in males, and copulation soon follows. Some species breed all year round while others synchronise their activities with their hosts' life cycles or with local environmental factors and climatic conditions. Flea populations consist of roughly 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.|$|E
25|$|Lucilia cuprina, {{like all}} flies are <b>holometabolous,</b> meaning {{they go through}} a {{complete}} metamorphosis.|$|E
25|$|Histeridae {{goes through}} <b>holometabolous</b> {{development}}. In {{this type of}} development the larval form does not resemble the adult form and the pupae has internally developing wings. They also undergo an immobile pupal stage where they do not eat. After the pupal stage they emerge in their adult form.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} of Sarcophaga bullata is {{characterized}} by <b>holometabolous</b> development, though, like all known sarcophagids, the species is larviparous, meaning that the egg develops internally and females then give birth to first-instar larvae. This must be accounted for when using the species in forensic work to calculate a post-mortem interval.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{the order}} Diptera have a <b>holometabolous</b> lifecycle, meaning they go through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa and imago, or adult. C. cadaverina {{typically}} has around 17 generations of offspring per year with 25 to 50 eggs per generation if the right conditions are present. Temperature can have an extreme impact on development. If the temperature gets above or below a certain temperature it can cause all development of the fly to stop. In general, the warmer it is, the faster the lifecycle will go; while if it is colder, the lifecycle may take longer than usual. This {{has to be taken}} into account when estimating the postmortem interval.|$|E
25|$|This {{would also}} {{affect the way}} their {{offspring}} looked like in the early instars, resembling earlier ametabolous generations even after they had started {{to adapt to a}} new way of living, in a habitat where they actually could have some good use for flaps along their body. Since they matured {{in the same way as}} thysanurans with plenty of moultings as they were growing and very little difference between the adults and much younger individuals (unlike modern insects, which are hemimetabolous or <b>holometabolous),</b> there probably wasn't much room for adapting into different niches depending on age and stage. Also, it would have been difficult for an animal already adapted to a niche to make a switch to a new niche later in life based on age or size differences alone when these differences were not significant.|$|E
25|$|The general {{life cycle}} of clerids {{has been known to}} last {{anywhere}} from 35 days to more than 3 years, and is strongly dependent on the {{life cycle of}} their prey. While the life cycle can vary in length between genus and species, temperature is also a major determinant in the length of time spent in each stage of development. The warmer the temperature is, the quicker the lifecycle, and the cooler the temperature is the slower the lifecycle. If temperatures dip below a threshold temperature {{for an extended period of}} time clerids and most other insects will have growth and developmental progress arrested. Like all beetles, Cleridae follow a <b>holometabolous</b> life cycle: the egg hatches into a larva, which grows and feeds, changing its skin to form a pupa, and the pupa shedding its skin to emerge as an adult. The larvae of the majority of the known species of Cleridae feed upon the eggs and young of wood-boring beetles, while the adults feed on the adult bark beetles.|$|E
25|$|The tarsus {{of insects}} {{corresponds}} to the penultimate segment of a generalized arthropod limb, which is the segment called the propodite in Crustacea. adult insects it is commonly subdivided into from two to five subsegments, or tarsomeres, but in the Protura, some Collembola, and most <b>holometabolous</b> insect larvae it preserves the primitive form of a simple segment. The subsegments of the adult insect tarsus are usually freely movable on one another by inflected connecting membranes, but the tarsus never has intrinsic muscles. The tarsus of adult pterygote insects having fewer than five subsegments is probably specialized {{by the loss of}} one or more subsegments or by a fusion of adjoining subsegments. In the tarsi of Acrididae the long basal piece is evidently composed of three united tarsomeres, leaving the fourth and the fifth. The basal tarsomere is sometimes conspicuously enlarged and is distinguished as the basitarsus. On the under surfaces of the tarsal subsegments in certain Orthoptera there are small pads, the tarsal pulvilli, or euplantulae. The tarsus is occasionally fused with the tibia in larval insects, forming a tibiotarsal segment; in some cases it appears to be eliminated or reduced to a rudiment between the tibia and the pretarsus.|$|E
500|$|A cocoon is {{a casing}} spun of silk by many moth caterpillars, and {{numerous}} other <b>holometabolous</b> insect larvae as a protective covering for the pupa. Most Lepidoptera larvae will either make a cocoon and pupate inside them or will pupate in a cell under the ground, {{with the exception of}} butterflies and advanced moths such as noctuids, whose pupae are exposed. The pupae of moths are usually brown and smooth whereas butterfly pupae are often colourful and their shape varies greatly. In butterflies, the exposed pupa {{is often referred to as}} a chrysalis, derived from the Greek term [...] "chrysalis": [...] (...) for gold, referring to the golden colour of some pupae.|$|E
500|$|When the larva attains {{its maximum}} size, it pupates and {{undergoes}} metamorphosis. It makes a globular cocoon of sand or other local substrate stuck together with fine silk spun from a slender spinneret {{at the rear}} end of the body. [...] The cocoon may be buried several centimetres deep in sand. After completing its transformation into an adult insect {{over the course of}} about one month, it emerges from the case, leaving the pupal integument behind, and works its way to the surface. After about twenty minutes, the adult's wings are fully opened and it flies off in search of a mate. The adult is considerably larger than the larva as antlions exhibit the greatest disparity in size between larva and adult of any type of <b>holometabolous</b> insect. This is by virtue {{of the fact that the}} exoskeleton of the adult is extremely thin and flimsy, with an exceptionally low mass per unit of volume. [...] The adult typically lives for about 25 days, but some insects survive for as long as 45 days.|$|E
500|$|The female {{lays the}} eggs {{in close contact}} with moisture, and the eggs {{typically}} absorb water and increase in size after deposition. In species that live in hot conditions, the eggs may not hatch for several months, the larvae only emerging when the dry season has finished. More typically, however, they hatch after {{a relatively short period of}} time. The larvae are usually quite caterpillar-like, with short, clawed, true legs, and a number of abdominal prolegs. They have sclerotised heads with mandibulate mouthparts. Larvae possess compound eyes, which is unique among <b>holometabolous</b> insects. The tenth abdominal segment bears either a suction disc, or, less commonly, a pair of hooks. They generally eat vegetation or scavenge for dead insects, although some predatory larvae are known. [...] The larva crawls into the soil or decaying wood to pupate, and does not spin a cocoon. The pupae are exarate, meaning the limbs are free of the body, and are able to move their mandibles, but are otherwise entirely nonmotile. In drier environments, they may spend several months in diapause, before emerging as adults once the conditions are more suitable.|$|E
2500|$|Arachnocampa {{species have}} <b>holometabolous</b> {{metamorphosis}} with eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults. [...] Individuals {{spend most of}} their lives as larvae.|$|E
2500|$|New Zealand grass grubs {{are one of}} {{the most}} common insects in New Zealand. Grass grubs belong to the <b>holometabolous</b> insect group, this means that they have a life cycle with four stages: egg, larva, pupa, adult.|$|E
2500|$|Knowledge of the {{lifecycle}} of C. rufifacies {{is crucial}} in determining the post mortem interval for applications related to medicocriminal entomology. Accurate developmental and successional data for the species can significantly aid in legal investigations. C. rufifacies is especially important in these determinations due to its highly predictable developmental time and low degree of variation in larval development. The lifecycle of C. rufifacies is characterized by <b>holometabolous</b> development, consisting of egg, larva, pupa, and adult stages. The entire lifecycle [...] takes 190 to 598 hours depending on temperature.|$|E
2500|$|The general {{lifecycle}} of Cochliomyia {{is similar}} to any other Diptera {{in that they are}} <b>holometabolous.</b> The four stages are egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This entire lifecycle lasts an average of 21 days at prime conditions (preferably a warm, moist environment), and can last as long as three months in colder climates. Females only lay eggs once in a lifetime and can lay 100 to 400 in a clutch. [...] Females usually lay their eggs on the edge of an open wound. The warm and moist conditions are the perfect combination of home and food source. The nasal, oral, or anal areas of a host are especially prone to Cochliomyia oviposition.|$|E
50|$|Miomoptera is an extinct {{order of}} insects. Although {{it is thought}} to be a common {{ancestor}} of all <b>holometabolous</b> insects, because no smooth transition between Miomoptera and other <b>holometabolous</b> insect orders is known it is considered to be in a separate order unto itself.|$|E

50|$|The Neuropterida are a clade of <b>holometabolous</b> insects {{with over}} 5,700 {{described}} species, containing the orders Neuroptera (lacewings, antlions), Megaloptera (dobsonflies, alderflies), and Raphidioptera (snakeflies).|$|E
50|$|Adult <b>holometabolous</b> insects {{usually have}} wings (excepting where {{secondarily}} lost) and functioning reproductive organs. In this stage, reproduction {{is the top}} priority for queens and males.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{hypotheses}} {{have been proposed}} to explain the evolution of holometaboly from hemimetaboly, mostly centering {{on whether or not}} the intermediate hemimetabolous forms are homologous to pupal form of <b>holometabolous</b> forms.|$|E
50|$|Being of {{the order}} Diptera, Protophormia terraenovae is <b>holometabolous</b> in its development, meaning it {{experiences}} dramatic changes from immature to adult. Protophormia terraenovae undergoes three instars, a pupal stage, and finally an adult stage.|$|E
50|$|The Miomopterans {{were small}} insects, with unspecialised chewing mandibles and short {{abdominal}} cerci. They had four wings of equal size, {{with a relatively}} simple venation, {{similar to that of}} the more primitive living <b>holometabolous</b> insects, such as lacewings.|$|E

5000|$|In <b>holometabolous</b> insects, {{immature}} stages {{are called}} larvae and differ markedly from adults. Insects which undergo holometabolism {{pass through a}} larval stage, then enter an inactive state called pupa (called a [...] "chrysalis" [...] in butterfly species), and finally emerge as adults.|$|E
50|$|A pupa (Latin pupa for doll, plural: pupae or pupas) is {{the life}} stage of some insects {{undergoing}} transformation. The pupal stage is found only in <b>holometabolous</b> insects, those that undergo a complete metamorphosis, going through four life stages: embryo, larva, pupa and imago.|$|E
50|$|Whiteflies share a {{modified}} form of hemimetabolous metamorphosis, {{in that the}} immature stages begin life as mobile individuals, but soon attach to host plants. The stage before the adult is called a pupa, though it shares {{little in common with}} the pupal stage of <b>holometabolous</b> insects.|$|E
50|$|Histeridae {{goes through}} <b>holometabolous</b> {{development}}. In {{this type of}} development the larval form does not resemble the adult form and the pupae has internally developing wings.

50|$|E. lecontei is a <b>holometabolous</b> insect, {{undergoing}} true metamorphosis. Development is temperature dependent, but {{the time}} to develop from egg to larvae is about 4 days, from larvae to pupae 13 days, and from pupae to adult 13 days.Larvae are stem borers and damage plant tissue from about 7 cm {{from the tip of}} the plant.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Two {{types of}} {{metamorphosis}} are shown. In a complete (<b>holometabolous)</b> metamorphosis the insect passes through four distinct phases, which produce an adult {{that does not}} resemble the larva. In an incomplete (hemimetabolous) metamorphosis an insect does not go through a full transformation, but instead transitions from a nymph to an adult by molting its exoskeleton as it grows.|$|E
5000|$|The lesser {{wax moth}} {{typically}} resides in milder climates, but can be prevalent {{in areas such as}} Florida because of the year-round warm climate.
