5000|$|In {{autumn of}} 1936 Dornberger asked Thiel {{to move from}} {{fundamental}} research to Wa Prüf 11 at Kummersdorf’s western testing ground. All topics regarding the engine were assigned to Thiel, {{and he had to}} further advance the propulsion, which he managed in a very short time. In his paper “Empirische und theoretische Grundlagen zur Neuberechnung von Öfen und Versuchsdaten, Schießplatz Kummersdorf Vers. West“, that he presented on April 27, 1937, Thiel introduces developments that lead to decisive changes, including a shortening of the oven and an optimization of the <b>injection</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Furthermore, Thiel continued to research different fuel mixtures for the rocket engines.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lack of an}} {{electrical}} ignition system also reduces the parasitic load on the engine, as the engine {{does not have to}} produce the necessary electricity to ignite the fuel. A significant amount of electricity is required by a spark ignition system, and as engine speeds and loads increase, the ignition system consumes proportionately more electricity, while simultaneously becoming less efficient. Higher cylinder pressure require a [...] "hotter" [...] spark with more current present to overcome the pressure and jump the gap from electrode to electrode in the spark plug. Increased engine speeds and loads also require the spark to occur more rapidly, resulting in additional electrical system loads and demands and more engine power required to meet them. As diesel engine speeds and loads increase, the higher cylinder temperatures after compression of the intake charge result in increased injection and ignition efficiency due to increased fuel atomization. Regardless of fuel system design, a mechanical diesel fuel injection system and rapid rise of fuel pressure and flow will result in <b>injection</b> <b>nozzle</b> opening pressure being reached more rapidly and also earlier in the 4-stroke cycle with more precise fuel delivery, more precise injection timing and built-in timing advance. Additional power is required to operate the injection system as engine speeds and loads increase, but the increase is more offset than in spark-ignition engines. Modern diesel engines with electronic injection systems use a large amount of electricity for injection, but the ability to precisely time injection and even perform multiple injection events per cycle result in generally increased fuel efficiency compared to mechanically-injected diesel engines of similar size and power.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. LCM {{simulation}} is computationally expensive {{because it}} needs an accurate solution of flow equations during the mold filling process. When simulating large computing times are not compati-ble with standard optimization techniques (for example for locating optimally the <b>injection</b> <b>nozzles)</b> or with process control {{that in general}} requires fast decision-makings. In this work, inspired by the concept of medial axis, we propose a numerical technique that computes numerically approximate distance fields by invoking computational geometry concepts {{that can be used}} for the optimal location of <b>injection</b> <b>nozzles</b> in infusion processes. On the other hand we also analyze the possibilities that model order reduction offers to fast and accurate solutions of flow models in mold filling processes...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{alternative}} fabrication method based on polymeric materials and technologies for three-axis thermal accelerometers. The device is composed by four microinjected parts forming an external structure {{responsible for the}} coupling and sealing of a polymeric membrane. The membrane contains and protects the heater and thermoresistors and is fabricated by microtechnologies. The fabrication process was successful although some issues were noticed in the mould during the microinjection process. Regarding the ejection side, a redesign was done to first assure the locking of the micro-parts on the movable side of the mould and second to improve the extraction of the parts avoiding its deformation. Overheating of the mould and polymer freezing on the <b>injection</b> <b>nozzle</b> were the main issues found on the injection side of the mould. Three different <b>injection</b> <b>nozzle</b> designs and two different fabrication materials were analyzed and simulated.

40|$|Reproducible {{vegetable}} oils have many advantages as alternative fuels {{in order to}} supplement diesel fuels. Compared with common diesel fuel, however, the use of {{vegetable oils}} results in higher exhaust emissions and carbon deposits {{because of the high}} viscosity and low volatility.

40|$|The {{passive control}} method for surge and {{rotating}} stall in centrifugal compressors {{by using a}} nozzle injection system was proposed to extend the stable operating range to the low flow rate. A part of the flow at the scroll outlet of a compressor was recirculated to an <b>injection</b> <b>nozzle</b> installed on the inner wall of the suction pipe of the compressor through the bypass pipe and injected to the impeller inlet. Two types of compressors were tested at the rotational speeds of 50, 000 [*]rpm and 60, 000 [*]rpm with the parameter of the circumferential position of the <b>injection</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The present experimental results revealed that the optimum circumferential position, which most effectively reduced the flow rate for the surge inception, existed at {{the opposite side of}} the tongue of the scroll against the rotational axis and did not depend on the compressor system and the rotational speeds...|$|E

40|$|Abstract A new {{technique}} is presented for micro-PIV measurements in high velocity flows of small dimensions like <b>injection</b> <b>nozzles</b> or sprays at the nozzle exit. The technique requires only one pulsed incoherent light source of sufficiently short pulse duration. This duration limits the maximal resolved velocity since the image pair is not acquired with one camera in straddling mode {{that would limit}} the minimal image temporal separation but with two cameras. For very fast flows temporal separations {{in the order of}} 20 nanoseconds would be needed. The pulse separation is obtained by the difference in light delay in plastic optical fibers of appropriate length. The delay is measured with a fast avalanche photodiode. The image separation is obtained optically by using polarized light and not electronically as in standard PIV. The light from the end of each fiber passes a polarizing beam splitter so that each light beam is polarized perpendicular to the other and traverses the object. Between the microscope objective and the cameras a second polarizing beam splitter separates the images. Provided the pulse duration of the light source is short enough there is no limit to the velocity range measurable. Exemplarily the cavitating flow in transparent <b>injection</b> <b>nozzles</b> is presented...|$|R
