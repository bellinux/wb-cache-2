These gates, connected to a computer network, can read and update electronic tickets capable of storing data, and can store information such as the initial and destination stations and the duration for each trip. General Ticketing Machines sell tickets <b>for</b> <b>single</b> trips or allow the customer to buy additional value for stored-value tickets. Tickets <b>for</b> <b>single</b> trips, coloured in green, are valid only {{on the day of}} purchase, and have a time allowance of 30 minutes beyond the estimated travelling time.

5|$|An {{expansion}} pack, The Deeper Dungeons, {{was released}} on 30 November 1997. It features fifteen new levels each <b>for</b> <b>single</b> player and multiplayer, and an improved artificial intelligence for the enemies. The Avatar also reappears in the final level. A Direct3D version, which brought improved graphics and 3D acceleration support, and a level editor were released for the game. These add-ons, along with the Deeper Dungeons and a Dungeon Keeper-based desktop theme, were bundled with the game, re-released as Dungeon Keeper Gold Edition on 31 December 1998. Dungeon Keeper received a fan-made mod, called KeeperFX. This mod increases compatibility with later versions of Windows, fixes bugs, and adds features such as TCP/IP multiplayer support.

5|$|Dirks' work in {{computational}} chemistry involved creating algorithms and computational {{tools for}} the analysis of nucleic acid thermodynamics and nucleic acid structure prediction. Dirks wrote the initial code for the NUPACK suite of nucleic acid design and analysis tools, which generates base pairing probabilities through calculation of the statistical partition function. Unlike other structure prediction tools, NUPACK is capable of handling an arbitrary number of interacting strands rather than being limited to one or two. Dirks also developed an algorithm capable of efficiently handling certain types of pseudoknots, a class of structure that is more computationally intensive to analyze, although NUPACK only implements this ability <b>for</b> <b>single</b> RNA strands.|$|E
5|$|English {{rock band}} Led Zeppelin {{recorded}} 108 songs during their career. Between 1969 and 1980, they released eight studio albums, one live album, and sixteen singles. After their breakup, a final studio album, three live albums, nine compilation albums, {{as well as}} deluxe editions of the original nine studio albums have been released. The band pioneered the concept of album-oriented rock and often refused to release popular songs as singles, instead viewing their albums as indivisible, complete listening experiences, and disliked labels re-editing their songs <b>for</b> <b>single</b> releases.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, singles {{have begun}} {{to take on a}} more {{prominent}} role in reshaping America. As a group, singles are increasingly becoming influential in politics and in the determination of many macro socioeconomic outcomes. In this descriptive paper we focus on homeownership among a subset of singles, the never married. In particular we investigate potential differences in the relationship between several homeownership determinants <b>for</b> <b>singles</b> in comparison to the married. In addition, we test for heterogeneity across race and skill level in the gender gap in homeownership and the probability of homeownership before and post the recession. Our results suggest that there are some differences in the relationship between certain factors and homeownership <b>for</b> <b>singles</b> versus those who are married. In particular, we find age, gender, and number of children affect the probability of homeownership differently <b>for</b> <b>singles</b> compared to those who are married. We also find that while on average there is a higher probability of homeownership from 2007 onwards <b>for</b> <b>singles,</b> there are gender, education and racial differences. Our results also suggest significant heterogeneity across race and skill level in homeownership probabilities <b>for</b> <b>singles...</b>|$|R

The {{bruising}} severely restricted his mobility and breathing, and he turned down a single after being called through by Loxton, who had come in at the fall of Morris. Soon after, the pair took a single, and Barnes collapsed after completing the run. Barnes {{was taken from the}} ground with the assistance of Bradman among others, and sent back to hospital to recuperate for several days. He took no further part in the match, which ended in a rain-affected draw; Johnson again fell <b>for</b> <b>single</b> figures in the second innings.

5|$|In 1938, Fingleton {{made what}} turned out to be his {{international}} farewell as Australia toured England, a series in which he found runs difficult to come by. He later attributed this to his inability to play the pull shot. However, Fingleton started the tour well. He passed 30 in each of his first seven innings on English soil, and converted three of these starts into centuries, scoring 124 against Oxford University, 111 against Cambridge University and 123 not out against Hampshire in the first month of cricket. Fingleton's form tapered just at the wrong time, falling three times <b>for</b> <b>single</b> figures in the last two matches before the Tests. He carried this into the First Test at Trent Bridge, where he made only 9 and 40 in a high-scoring draw in which every innings passed 400.|$|E
