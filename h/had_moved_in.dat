A close friend of both Roosevelt and Mercer who was present, Elizabeth Shoumatoff, rushed Mercer away to avoid negative publicity and implications of infidelity.

5|$|Sujoy Ghosh {{approached}} {{novelist and}} script writer Advaita Kala {{with the idea}} for the film. Kala took inspiration from her experience in Kolkata, where she <b>had</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> 1999, akin to the protagonist in the film. She reported that despite facing a language barrier and the chaos and poverty of the metropolis, she was charmed by the warmth of the people, which was reflected in the film. Kala started writing in 2009 and finished the 185-page script by February 2010. Her research included reading the books Open Secrets: India's Intelligence Unveiled by Maloy Krishna Dhar and India's External Intelligence: Secrets of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) by V. K.

5|$|After an {{unremarkable}} school career, Eichmann briefly {{worked for}} his father's mining company in Austria, {{where the family}} <b>had</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> 1914. He worked as a travelling oil salesman beginning in 1927, and joined both the Nazi Party and the SS in 1932. After returning to Germany in 1933, he joined the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; Security Service), where he was appointed {{head of the department}} responsible for Jewish affairs—especially emigration, which the Nazis encouraged through violence and economic pressure. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Eichmann and his staff arranged for Jews to be concentrated in ghettos in major cities with the expectation that they would be transported either farther east or overseas. Eichmann drew up plans for a Jewish reservation, first at Nisko in south-east Poland and later in Madagascar, but neither of these plans were ever carried out.|$|E

5|$|Jones {{decided to}} bring back his other two squads to form a solid line and, expecting to be gone only a few minutes, he left his SCR-300 radio behind. Jones found one squad but the other had gone on farther and was not visible. While he studied the terrain and waited for a {{messenger}} he had sent to bring back that last squad, North Koreans attacked the main company position behind him. Judging by the noise he heard, Jones thought North Koreans <b>had</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> force to the wooded bowl {{between him and the}} rest of the company. Jones never got back to his 3rd Squad. He {{and the rest of the}} platoon dropped down off the ridge into a gully on the left.|$|E
5|$|The National Trust {{took control}} of the Tor in 1933, but repairs were delayed until after the Second World War. During the 1960s, {{excavations}} identified cracks in the rock, suggesting the ground <b>had</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> the past. This, combined with wind erosion, started to expose the footings of the tower, which were repaired with concrete. Erosion caused by the feet of the increasing number of visitors was also a problem and paths were laid to enable them to reach the summit without damaging the terraces. After 2000, enhancements to the access and repairs to the tower, including rebuilding of the parapet, were carried out. These included the replacement of some of the masonry damaged by earlier repairs with new stone from the Hadspen Quarry.|$|E
5|$|By 19 March Fay's track {{had turned}} to the west-southwest, {{and over the next}} day it {{continued}} to strengthen in due to favourable upper level outflow and weak vertical sheer. On 21 March, Fay became a Category5 cyclone on the Australian Region Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. A mid-latitude trough caused the steering ridge to weaken, and subsequently, Fay to turn to the south. Over the next two days, the environmental shear around the cyclone decreased, which would normally have led to intensification; however, as the shear decreased, the cyclone also moved over an area of dry air, weakening the system. By 23 March, Fay <b>had</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> a loop, and the system weakened to a Category 2. Over the next day, favourable outflow counteracted the dry air that had weakened the system, and a banding eye feature was observed on satellite imagery. Fay then encountered moister air as it moved southward, leading it to re-intensify on 25 March. A weak eye of 10 nm was observed on 26 March which grew to 15nm as the day went on. Strengthening into a Category 4 system early on 27 March, Fay made landfall on the Pilbara coast between 8am and 9am AWST (0000 and 0100UTC) with winds of , weakening below cyclone strength somewhere between the towns of Nullagine and Telfer.|$|E
