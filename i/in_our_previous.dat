She was a trifle larger than the Crisis, mounted twelve French nines, and had eighty-three souls on board when she sailed. Of these, however, no less than twenty-three had been killed and wounded <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>previous</b> affair with her, and several were absent in a prize.

60|$|III. Many {{difficult}} problems arise {{as regards the}} verifiability of beliefs. We believe various things, and while we believe them {{we think we know}} them. But it sometimes turns out that we were mistaken, or at any rate we come to think we were. We must be mistaken either <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>previous</b> opinion or in our subsequent recantation; therefore our beliefs are not all correct, and there are cases of belief which are not cases of knowledge. The question of verifiability is in essence this: can we discover any set of beliefs which are never mistaken or any test which, when applicable, will always enable us to discriminate between true and false beliefs? Put thus broadly and abstractly, the answer must be negative. There is no way hitherto discovered of wholly eliminating the risk of error, and no infallible criterion. If we believe we have found a criterion, this belief itself may be mistaken; we should be begging the question if we tried to test the criterion by applying the criterion to itself.|$|E
6000|$|Except, however, in {{such cases}} as games of chance, where the very purpose in view {{requires}} ignorance instead of knowledge, I can conceive no case in which {{we ought to be}} satisfied with such an estimate of chances as this—an estimate founded on the absolute minimum of knowledge respecting the subject. It is plain that, {{in the case of the}} colored balls, a very slight ground of surmise that the white balls were really more numerous than either of the other colors, would suffice to vitiate the whole of the calculations made <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>previous</b> state of indifference. It would place us in that position of more advanced knowledge, in which the probabilities, to us, would be different from what they were before; and in estimating these new probabilities we should have to proceed on a totally different set of data, furnished no longer by mere counting of possible suppositions, but by specific knowledge of facts. Such data it should always be our endeavor to obtain; and in all inquiries, unless on subjects equally beyond the range of our means of knowledge and our practical uses, they may be obtained, if not good, at least better than none at all.(177) ...|$|E
6000|$|Proceeding on our {{way past}} the Cherry Tree, and {{resisting}} cosy invitation of its portals, {{we come to the}} shopping quarter of the town. The stock in windows is made by hand out of plasticine. We note the meat and hams of [...] "Mr. Woddy," [...] the cabbages and carrots of [...] "Tod & Brothers," [...] the general activities of the [...] "Jokil Co." [...] shopmen. It is de rigueur with our shop assistants that they should wear white helmets. In the street, boy scouts go to and fro, a wagon clatters by; most of the adult population is about its business, and a red-coated band plays along the roadway. Contrast this animated scene with the mysteries of sea and forest, rock and whirlpool, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>previous</b> game. Further on is the big church or cathedral. It is built in an extremely debased Gothic style; it reminds us most of a church we once surveyed during a brief visit to Rotterdam {{on our way}} up the Rhine. A solitary boy scout, mindful of the views of Lord Haldane, enters its high portal. Passing the cathedral, we continue to the museum. This museum is no empty boast; it contains mineral specimens, shells--such great shells as were found on the beaches of our previous game--the Titanic skulls of extinct rabbits and cats, and other such wonders. The slender curious may lie {{down on the floor and}} peep in at the windows.|$|E
