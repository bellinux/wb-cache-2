2500|$|Carpenter {{edited the}} film using the {{pseudonym}} John T. Chance, {{the name of}} John Wayne's character in Rio Bravo. Debra Hill acted as an uncredited assistant editor. According to Carpenter, the editing process was very bare bones. One mistake Carpenter was not proud of was one shot [...] "cut out of frame," [...] which means the cut is made within the frame so a viewer can see it. Assault was shot on Panavision, which takes up the entire negative, and edited on Moviola, which cannot show the whole image, so if a cut was made improperly (i.e., <b>frame</b> <b>line</b> not lined up properly) then one would cut a half of a sprocket into the film and [...] "cut out of frame," [...] as happened to Carpenter. In the end, {{it did not matter}} because he said [...] "It was so dark no one could see it, thank God!" ...|$|E

50|$|The Nikon SP has dual viewfinders {{providing}} <b>frame</b> <b>lines</b> for a {{total of}} six focal lengths.

The frames are parallax-corrected and the focusing patch appears in the centre of the viewfinder. A separate, smaller viewfinder (less than life size) {{to the left of the}} main viewfinder has non-parallax corrected <b>frame</b> <b>lines</b> for 35 mm.

50|$|The Bessa R2A and Bessa R3A, both {{introduced}} in 2004, are the current {{models in the}} Bessa line. They are both updated versions of the Bessa R2, with the Leica M-mount and an aperture-priority automatic exposure, switchable to manual. The R2A has a finder with a 0.7x maginification, and 35/50/75/90 <b>frame</b> <b>lines.</b> The R3A has a finder with a 1x magnification, and 40/50/75/90 <b>frame</b> <b>lines.</b> Both can take the trigger advance accessory.|$|R
50|$|A <b>frame</b> <b>line</b> is the unused {{space that}} {{separates}} two adjacent images, or film frames, on the release print of a motion picture. They can vary in width; a 35 mm film with a 1.85:1 hard matte has a <b>frame</b> <b>line</b> approximately 8 millimeters (0.3 inches) high, whereas both a full frame negative and the anamorphic format have very narrow frame lines, with the frames very close together. When a film is properly projected, the frame lines {{should not be}} visible to the audience and are typically cropped out in projection with an aperture mask.|$|E

25|$|The {{black ink}} <b>framing</b> <b>lines</b> drawn around each design {{are thought to}} have been added at a later date, {{possibly}} in 1818, just prior to Blake giving the plates to John Linnell. The ink and wash work in the designs themselves may also have been executed at that time, although this cannot be ascertained for certain. It has been suggested that the <b>framing</b> <b>lines</b> may have been added due to the discrepancy between the size of the plates {{and the size of the}} paper (each sheet is 37.8 x 27cm.).|$|R
50|$|Some {{obsolete}} formats such as 9.5 mm {{film and}} some variants of 17.5 mm film used a single perforation {{in the middle}} of the <b>frame</b> <b>line</b> between each image. This is however considered a liability, since any sprocket or claw error will likely damage the center of the frame itself rather than the outer edges.|$|E
50|$|Another use of mattes in filmmaking is {{to create}} a {{widescreen}} effect. In this process, {{the top and bottom of}} a standard frame are matted out, or masked, with black bars, i.e. the film print has a thick <b>frame</b> <b>line.</b> Then the frame within the full frame is enlarged to fill a screen when projected in a theater.|$|E

5000|$|The {{modified}} web {{that the}} larva causes the spider to build consists of several heavily reinforced radial lines that are attached {{directly to the}} substrate; sometimes one or more <b>frame</b> <b>lines</b> or vestiges of a [...] "temporary" [...] spiral are also included. The reinforced lines are built using {{a subset of the}} same sequence of movements that the spider performs during the construction of <b>frame</b> <b>lines</b> in the normal web, repeated many times over. Thus the larva appears to be able to induce very specific behavioral responses in the spider.|$|R

50|$|During {{the silent}} era, aspect ratios varied widely, from square 1:1, {{all the way}} up to the extreme {{widescreen}} 4:1 Polyvision. However, from the 1910s, silent motion pictures generally settled on the ratio of 4:3 (1.33). The introduction of sound-on-film briefly narrowed the aspect ratio, to allow room for a sound stripe. In 1932, a new standard was introduced, the Academy ratio of 1.37, by means of thickening the <b>frame</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

50|$|A BT.656 {{data stream}} is a {{sequence}} of 8-bit or 10-bit Word (computer architecture), transmitted {{at a rate of}} 27 Mword/s. Horizontal scan lines of video pixel data are delimited in the stream by 4-byte long SAV (Start of Active Video) and EAV (End of Active Video) code sequences. SAV codes also contain status bits indicating line position in a video field or <b>frame.</b> <b>Line</b> position in a full frame can be determined by tracking SAV status bits, allowing receivers to 'synchronize' with an incoming stream.|$|E
50|$|The Leica CL has a vertical-running {{focal plane}} shutter, with cloth curtains, giving ½ to 1/1000 speeds. There is a through-the-lens CdS {{exposure}} meter {{mounted on a}} pivoting arm {{just in front of}} the shutter, like the Leica M5. The exposure is manual and the shutter is mechanical. The shutter speeds are visible in the finder. The finder's framelines are for a 40mm, 50mm or 90mm lens. The 40mm frameline is always present and the 50mm or 90mm <b>frame</b> <b>line</b> is automatically selected upon mounting of the appropriate lens.|$|E

The remaining seven plates are known only in this single impression. The black ink <b>framing</b> <b>lines</b> in Copy L are thought to have been added at a later date, possibly in 1818, just prior to when Blake gave the plates to John Linnell. It has been suggested that the <b>framing</b> <b>lines</b> may have been added due to the discrepancy between the size of the plates {{and the size of the}} paper (each plate is roughly 5.4 x 4cm.; each page is 37.8 x 27cm). In all copies other than Copy L, the plates are roughly 14 x 11cm.|$|R
