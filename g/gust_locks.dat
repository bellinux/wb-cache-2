25|$|On November 13, 2001, {{the pilot}} of a {{twin-engine}} Cessna failed to remove the <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> prior to startup and two were killed when the aircraft overran the runway after an unsuccessful aborted takeoff.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical or {{manually}} operated flight control systems {{are the most}} basic method of controlling an aircraft. They were used in early aircraft and are currently used in small aircraft where the aerodynamic forces are not excessive. Very early aircraft, such as the Wright Flyer I, Blériot XI and Fokker Eindecker used a system of wing warping where no conventionally hinged control surfaces were used on the wing, and sometimes not even for pitch control as on the Wright Flyer I and original versions of the 1909 Etrich Taube, which only had a hinged/pivoting rudder {{in addition to the}} warping-operated pitch and roll controls. A manual flight control system uses a collection of mechanical parts such as pushrods, tension cables, pulleys, counterweights, and sometimes chains to transmit the forces applied to the cockpit controls directly to the control surfaces. Turnbuckles are often used to adjust control cable tension. The Cessna Skyhawk is a typical example of an aircraft that uses this type of system. <b>Gust</b> <b>locks</b> are often used on parked aircraft with mechanical systems to protect the control surfaces and linkages from damage from wind. Some aircraft have <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> fitted as part of the control system.|$|E
2500|$|The {{flight was}} part of [...] "Operation: Sleigh Ride", a USAF airlift program to bring U.S. {{servicemen}} fighting in the Korean War home for Christmas. [...] At around 18:30 PST, the C-124 lifted off from Larson Air Force Base near Moses Lake, Washington en route to Kelly Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas. [...] Just seconds after taking off, the left wing struck {{the ground and the}} aircraft cartwheeled, broke up, and exploded, killing 82 of the 105 passengers and 5 of the 10 crew members. [...] Investigation into the accident revealed that the aircraft's elevator and rudder <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> had not been disengaged prior to departure.|$|E
25|$|The AAIB {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} the accident {{was caused by the}} locked condition of the aircraft's elevators which prevented the aircraft rotating into a flying attitude. It was thought likely that the elevator <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> became re-engaged during the pilots' pre-takeoff checks, and that it was not noticed until the takeoff was so far advanced that a successful abandonment within the overrun area could not be made. The re-engagement of the <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> was made possible by the condition of the <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> lever gate plate and gate-stop strip, to which non-standard repairs had been made.|$|R
25|$|That the <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> system be {{redesigned}} {{to ensure}} positive operation {{at all times}} and avoid misleading the crew as {{to the position of}} any lock.|$|R
50|$|As {{these many}} tragedies (and {{this is far}} from a {{complete}} list) illustrate, when a <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> is used, its disengagement is a very important step on the preflight checklist.|$|R
5000|$|A {{gust lock}} can pose a serious safety hazard if its removal is omitted before an aircraft's takeoff, because it renders the flight control inoperative. Many {{internal}} <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> have a safety feature that locks out the aircraft's throttle or engine-start controls until removed and stowed. External-only <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> typically lack this safety feature, {{and must be}} tagged with a large red [...] streamer.|$|E
50|$|A C-124 {{transport}} carrying US servicemen {{home for}} Christmas crashed in 1952 due to engagement of <b>gust</b> <b>locks.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{very first}} example built of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, the initial Model 299 aircraft, {{was lost in}} just this way on October 30, 1935, when its {{self-contained}} <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> were left engaged, with the resulting crash killing Boeing chief test pilot Leslie Tower, and United States Army Air Corps test pilot Ployer Peter Hill. Less than a year later, German Luftwaffe Generalleutnant Walter Wever lost {{his life in a}} similar accident from gust lock neglect, when his Heinkel He 70 Blitz monoplane crashed on June 3, 1936, from the Blitz's aileron <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> not being disengaged before takeoff. Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden, the American singer and actress Grace Moore and 21 others were killed in 1947 during the crash of a KLM flight at Copenhagen Airport due to the flight crew forgetting to disengage the gust lock on the tail fin of the aircraft. The crash of Air Indiana Flight 216 occurred due to failure to remove the <b>gust</b> <b>locks.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{recent example}} of a tragedy {{involving}} a <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> left in place was a crash of a Gulfstream IV at Hanscom Field on May 31, 2014. This crash killed Philadelphia Inquirer co-owner Lewis Katz as well as 6 others.|$|R
50|$|On May 31, 2014, Katz and {{six others}} died when their private plane crashed at Hanscom Field and erupted into fire. An FAA {{spokesperson}} {{said that a}} Gulfstream IV corporate jet apparently ran off Runway 11 at the base. The aircraft was departing to Atlantic City, New Jersey when it failed to take off because the <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> was left engaged.|$|R
50|$|January 9, 1998 - a Cessna 208B Super Cargomaster, on {{take off}} from Maiden-Little Mountain Airport in Maiden, North Carolina on a flight to Greensboro, North Carolina, veered off the runway and hit trees. The crash was {{determined}} to be due to the control <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> still being in place during the takeoff. The pilot, who was the only occupant, was killed.|$|R
50|$|A {{gust lock}} on an {{aircraft}} is a mechanism that locks control surfaces and keeps open aircraft doors in place while the aircraft is {{parked on the}} ground and non-operational. <b>Gust</b> <b>locks</b> prevent wind from causing unexpected movements of the control surfaces and their linked controls inside the aircraft, as well as aircraft doors on some aircraft. Otherwise wind gusts could cause possible damage to the control surfaces and systems, or nearby people, cargo, or machinery. Some <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> are external devices attached directly to the aircraft's control surfaces, while others are attached to the flight controls inside the cockpit.|$|E
50|$|On November 13, 2001, {{the pilot}} of a {{twin-engine}} Cessna failed to remove the <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> prior to startup and two were killed when the aircraft overran the runway after an unsuccessful aborted takeoff.|$|E
50|$|On December 5, 1978, Douglas C-53 N25656 of Caribe Air Sales crashed {{shortly after}} {{take-off}} and {{was destroyed by}} fire. The <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> had not been removed before flight and the aircraft was overloaded. All three people on board were killed.|$|E
5000|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board {{concluded}} {{the report on}} the accident by citing pilot error of the source. The report read: [...] "The Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was either {{the failure of the}} pilot to release the <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> before take-off, or his decision to discontinue the take-off because of apprehension resulting from rapid use of a short runway under a possible calm wind condition." ...|$|R
50|$|Dan-Air Flight 0034, a Hawker Siddeley 748 series 1 (registration G-BEKF) {{operating}} an {{oil industry}} support flight crashed on 31 July 1979 at Sumburgh Airport in the Shetland Islands. The aircraft failed to become airborne, {{ran through the}} perimeter fence, and crashed into the sea. The accident {{was due to the}} elevator <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> having become re-engaged, preventing the aircraft from rotating into a flying attitude. The aircraft was destroyed and 17 of the 47 people on board drowned.|$|R
50|$|Following a {{checklist}} {{would have shown}} that the <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> was engaged on the Gulfstream IV crash on May 31, 2014. The National Transportation Safety Board downloaded data from the aircraft's recorder and found it was a habit: 98% of the previous 175 takeoffs were made with incomplete flight-control checks. The National Business Aviation Association analyzed 143,756 flights in 2013-2015 by 379 business aircraft and only partial flight-control checks were done before 15.6% of the takeoffs and no checks at all on 2.03% of the flights.|$|R
50|$|The {{probable}} {{cause of the}} crash {{was determined to be}} failure to remove the <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> that had secured the aircraft's elevators while it was parked. It was the worst aviation accident in Denmark {{at the time of the}} crash.|$|E

50|$|On 25 September 1959, a Saudia Douglas DC-4/C-54A-5-DO (registration HZ-AAF), {{performed}} a belly landing shortly after take-off {{from the old}} Jeddah Airport (OEJD). The cause of the accident were <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> not deactivated by the mechanic, followed by a stall. All 67 passengers and 5 crew survived.|$|E
5000|$|... 2 December 1970: A Cargolux Canadair CL-44 (registered TF-LLG) {{crashed into}} farm houses near Dhaka Tejgaon Airport, killing all four crew {{on board and}} three people on the ground. The origin of the flight was Hamburg, where it was loaded with 27.5 tons of child food by the Swiss Red Cross. The cargo was {{intended}} to help flood victims in East Pakistan. While the flight was approaching Dhaka Tejgaon Airport, the hydraulic <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> system activated in flight, causing the controls to lock. The crew {{lost control of the}} aircraft and it crashed. It was speculated that the lock system had activated as hydraulic back pressure had built up caused by a malfunctioning switch valve when hydraulics were armed on descend.|$|R
50|$|Prince Gustaf Adolf {{was killed}} in an {{airplane}} crash in the afternoon of 26 January 1947 at Kastrup Airport, Copenhagen, Denmark. The prince, along with two companions, was returning to Stockholm from a hunting trip and visit to Princess Juliana and Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. The delayed KLM flight from Amsterdam had landed at Copenhagen for a routine stop before continuing to Stockholm. Soon after the Douglas DC-3 aircraft took off, it climbed to an altitude of about 50 meters (150 ft), stalled, and plummeted nose-first to the ground, where it exploded on impact. All 22 people aboard the plane (16 passengers and six crew members) were killed. Also aboard the ill-fated flight was American singer and actress Grace Moore. An investigation found that, short of time, the plane's captain had failed to perform the final pre-flight check list properly and took off not realizing that a <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> on an elevator was still in place.|$|R
40|$|Flight Safety is {{nowadays}} one of {{the concerns}} of global aviation community and is relevant to the survival of the aeronautical industry. In this context, expansion of human factors awareness presents a significant opportunity to make aviation safer, since the human / machine interface is a frequent source of error. This work analyzes the human interface with a specific aircraft system, i. e., the <b>Gust</b> <b>Lock</b> System of ERJ- 145. The aim is to define a framework for developing a human error assessment process to mitigate the effects of human error, in the same way the system safety process mitigates the effects of system possible failures. From the system safety engineering standpoint, the human can be taken as part of the considered system. Then, functions that the human needs to perform in his interaction with the system can be identified. With this information, each human failure mode can be assessed critically and the human related failure effects along the system can be studied. This study can result in design changes or improvements that may minimize the effects of unacceptable human failure modes. Furthermore, it is discussed some points of the Safety Assessment conducted by EMBRAER, in order to identify possible deficiencies in the development of safety cases using classical safety analysis techniques as well as make suggestions for the enhancement of these techniques. According to this approach, an analysis of the calculation of the average probability per flight hour is condusted when there are latent events along the process. Besides, it is performed the sensitivity analysis of a component failure so as to identify technical bottlenecks and provide guidelines for effective actions to the system improvement. Finally, considerations regarding the susceptibility of each failure condition to human influence are also presented...|$|R
50|$|On 28 June 1971, Douglas C-47 N90627 of Lake Riverside Estates {{crashed on}} {{take-off}} on a domestic non-scheduled passenger flight to San Jose International Airport. Seventeen of the 24 {{people on board}} were killed. The cause of the accident was that flight was attempted with the rudder and elevator <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> in place. Inadequate pre-flight inspection was a contributory factor.|$|E
5000|$|On December 13, 1977, Douglas C-53 N51071 of National Jet Services, {{operating}} as Air Indiana Flight 216, crashed on take-off from Evansville on a non-scheduled passenger flight to Nashville Metropolitan Airport, Tennessee. All 29 {{people on board}} were killed, including the entire University of Evansville basketball team. The cause of the accident was that the <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> had not been removed and the aircraft was improperly loaded, resulting in an aft CoG.|$|E
50|$|According to {{researcher}} and writer Atul Gawande, {{the concept of}} a pre-flight checklist was first introduced by management and engineers at Boeing Corporation following the 1935 crash of the prototype Boeing B-17 (then known as the Model 299) at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, killing both pilots. Investigation found that the pilots had forgotten to disengage the crucial <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> (devices which stop control surfaces moving in the wind while parked) prior to take-off. Life magazine published the resulting lengthy and detailed B-17 checklist in its 24 August 1942 issue.|$|E
50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{blamed the}} crash on the pilot's failure to remove <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> {{on the right}} aileron and the rudder before takeoff, {{as well as an}} {{overloaded}} baggage compartment. The NTSB report said that the plane {{might have been able to}} stay airborne had only one of the problems existed. As it was, the extra baggage shifted the plane's center of gravity to the back end, and the locked rudder and aileron made it impossible to provide the needed lift to overcome the extra weight.|$|E
5000|$|Development {{continued}} on the Boeing Model 299, and on 30 October 1935, Army Air Corps test-pilot Major Ployer Peter Hill and Boeing employee Les Tower took the Model 299 {{on a second}} evaluation flight. The crew forgot to disengage the [...] "gust locks", a system of devices integral to the design that held the bomber's movable control surfaces in place while the aircraft was parked on the ground. After takeoff, due to the failure to manually disengage all of the <b>gust</b> <b>locks,</b> the aircraft entered a steep climb, stalled, nosed over, and crashed, killing Hill and Tower (other observers survived with injuries).|$|E

This arrangement can be found on bigger or higher performance propeller aircraft such as the Fokker 50.|$|E
50|$|On 3 June 1936 Wever {{flew from}} Berlin to Dresden, {{to give a}} lecture at the Luftkriegsschule Klotzsche to a {{gathering}} of Luftwaffe cadets. When he received {{the news of the}} death of a World War I German hero, he immediately set off for Berlin. On his return journey, the Heinkel He 70 Blitz that he was flying had not been properly examined during preflight checks, and the aileron <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> were not removed. The aircraft was airborne when the wing dipped, and the Heinkel stalled and went into a horizontal cartwheel (akin to a ground loop, but at low altitude). It crashed and exploded in flames, killing Wever and his flight engineer. That same day, the RLM issued the Bomber A heavy bomber specification and design competition for what would become the Luftwaffe's only wartime heavy bomber in production and frontline service, the Heinkel He 177.|$|E
