50|$|The Pacific Electric Railway car used in {{the film}} had been saved from the scrap heap, {{refitted}} with an internal combustion <b>engine,</b> <b>rubber</b> tires, and a steering mechanism, and used in several period films set in Los Angeles prior to its appearance in this film. In 2001 it was refurbished to operate on a rail line serving San Pedro, California.|$|E
5000|$|There were {{numerous}} other design problems which were gradually addressed over the years, although some persisted to the end. [...] The early clutches could not handle the engine torque, {{and two small}} internal pins would shear off, leading to severe slippage (later resolved). The side-stand tended to break off, particularly if the owner insisted on starting the machine on the side-stand, leaving {{a hole in the}} frame beneath the engine, while the center-stand was too short to provide good support for the motorcycle, dragged on the pavement, and tended to break in half (both later improved). The <b>engine</b> <b>rubber</b> mounting system, which isolated the rider from vibration very well, left the engine to its own devices, and it shook like a commercial paint can shaker at idle.|$|E
40|$|Abstract ： The rigid-flexible system {{dynamic model}} of wobble plate engine {{was created by}} BUSH element and so on in ADAMS software. And {{stiffness}} optimized calculation of <b>engine</b> <b>rubber</b> isolator ring and spring was done by ADAMS optimized module. By comparing the time domain and frequency domain vibration response before optimization and after optimization, the feasibility of optimized method for decreasing engine vibration and changing system response frequency range was verified. This method could provide important reference for vibration dynamic model creating of engine or analogous mechanical system. Its conclusions also could provide reference for decreasing vibration study...|$|E
50|$|The 835 {{model was}} revised for 1929 and was offered in two sizes {{designated}} the 827 and 837, on 127 in and 137 in wheelbases respectively. The <b>engines</b> were <b>rubber</b> mounted.|$|R

5000|$|... "Standard" [...] {{models were}} basic with no side badging and were mostly fitted with 149ci <b>engines,</b> <b>rubber</b> floor mats and single-tone acrylic paint finish. [...] "Special" [...] models came {{equipped}} with stainless moulding strips all round, special badges and optional two-tone paint jobs still in acrylic paint. [...] "Premier" [...] {{was the top}} of the range model with 179ci engine and hydramatic transmission, leather interior, bucket seats, fold down centre armrest in the back seat, carpets, metallic paint, centre console incorporating a heater/demister, diamond dot radio, handbrake warning light and chrome plated wheel trims. The Standard EH was the same price as its predecessor (EJ) at A$2102.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs {{the usage}} of {{vehicles}} has become necessary in every person's life the automotive industries {{are in need of}} reducing the vibration forces to satisfy the customer requirements. The performance and riding comfort of the automobiles are affected due to the vibrating forces. The power plants are the one of the major sources of vibration and these vibrations are caused because of the unbalanced forces from the engine. Engine mounts are identified as the one of the major sources of vibration controllers. In this investigation, modeling and analysis of an <b>engine</b> <b>rubber</b> mount are done. The mount consists of two mild steel plates and a rubber isolator in between the plates. The modeling and assembly of rubber mount components is done using I-DEAS and finite element structural analysis and numerical investigation are made on the finite element (FE) analysis software ABAQUS. The deformations of rubber mount obtained from FE analysis are used in the Minitab to develop the mathematical model and deformations are obtained with respect to different process parameters. The results obtained from the predicted model are compared with the numerical simulation results...|$|E
50|$|Cooling to {{the engine}} is {{provided}} by a shaped metal pipe strewn underneath the rear running board which {{is used as a}} rudimentary heat-exchanger. This is then coupled to the <b>engine</b> using <b>rubber</b> or plastic hoses. Clean water is then used as the coolant.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{powered by}} a 250 cc [...] Pannonia {{motorcycle}} <b>engine.</b> The <b>rubber</b> suspension was developed from an idea of Ernő Rubik Sr., father of Ernő Rubik who later became famous for his cube. The roof and doors were in one piece and hinged to give access to the interior.|$|R
50|$|Powered {{aircraft}} {{have one}} or more onboard sources of mechanical power, typically aircraft <b>engines</b> although <b>rubber</b> and manpower have also been used. Most aircraft engines are either lightweight piston engines or gas turbines. Engine fuel is stored in tanks, usually in the wings but larger aircraft also have additional fuel tanks in the fuselage.|$|R
5000|$|As a chief design {{engineer}} for Chrysler, Skelton {{is credited with}} leading {{the development of a}} <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> mount system for cars. Directed to develop ideas to reduce motor vibration, Skelton's team conceptualized more than 1,000 separate ideas; the Chrysler team combined the best concepts into a new system known as [...] "floating power." [...] The <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> mounts and other components of the system significantly reduced the transmission of engine vibration to the passenger compartment, thus smoothing the ride. This Skelton/Chrysler engineering innovation spread throughout the automobile industry.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the road surface, vibrations in a motorcycle {{can be caused by}} the engine and wheels, if unbalanced. Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations, such as <b>engine</b> balance shafts, <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> mounts, and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts and systems designed to reduce it. Add-ons include handlebar weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine counterweights. At high speeds, motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting. This can be abated by changing the air flow over key parts, such as the windshield.|$|R
25|$|Early air {{services}} between London, Paris and Amsterdam were {{operated by}} a fleet of DH.9s owned by Aircraft Transport and Travel. A number of DH9s were converted into floatplanes and saw use in Indian, Bolivia and Rhodesia. Several aircraft were reconfigured to serve as trainer aircraft, being refitted with Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar <b>engines</b> and <b>rubber</b> undercarriages; designated as DH.9Js, the last of these were withdrawn and scrapped in 1936.|$|R
50|$|The {{campground}} in {{the town}} had a home built railroad which runs around the pond, this has been removed due to liability reasons. The roadbed can still {{be seen as a}} rubber walkway, the rails since removed. The train can still be seen onsite sinking into sand, now used as a playground for children. This <b>engine</b> used <b>rubber</b> on its wheels to get up a very steep grade in the SE corner.|$|R
5000|$|Engine mount {{breakages}} {{were known}} to occur, especially when the car was driven roughly. This problem was particularly evident in the later fuel injected engines, because the increased engine power correspondingly increased the stress on the Camira's <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> mounts.|$|R
5000|$|Lee Iacocca credits Chrysler's {{chief of}} {{engineering}} during that era, Frederick Zeder, with leading the effort. Iacocca said that Zeder [...] "was {{the first man}} {{to figure out how to}} get the vibrations out of cars. His solution? He mounted their <b>engines</b> on a <b>rubber</b> base." ...|$|R
5000|$|The PT 19 flight trainer taught {{many people}} control line flying, without risking their own creations. At least the early {{all-metal}} reed valve <b>engines,</b> with the <b>rubber</b> spinners that came on ready-to-fly models, survive crashes {{to be used}} later in balsa models, thus spreading the hobby and Cox's business.|$|R
50|$|All {{mechanical}} {{systems in the}} real world contain some amount of damping. Damping dissipates energy in the system, which reduces the vibration level which is transmitted at the natural frequency. The fluid in automotive shock absorbers is a kind of damper, as is the inherent damping in elastomeric (<b>rubber)</b> <b>engine</b> mounts.|$|R

50|$|The tall, {{long-stroke}} motor's vibration tendencies are {{helped by}} large, <b>rubber,</b> <b>engine</b> mounts. One- and two-barrel carburated versions were offered. The two-barrel version, the L11 option, {{also included a}} revised camshaft for a power increase of 20 hp (15 kW). The engine used a 3.501 in bore, 3.625 in stroke and 8:1 compression.|$|R
50|$|Instruments {{included}} a speedometer and trip recorder. To reduce noise and vibration, the <b>engine</b> was <b>rubber</b> mounted, and the pressed steel frame {{was lined with}} soundproofing felt. The water-cooled engine was well silenced, and riders reported that sometimes they only knew the engine was running by checking the ignition light. Carrying capacity was boosted by quickly detachable panniers and a glove compartment {{in front of the}} petrol tank. All this made the MkI LE expensive, however, at £126 compared with the BSA Bantam at £76. The odd looks also meant that it did not appeal to the usual motorcycle buyer.|$|R
50|$|In {{larger and}} more modern <b>engines,</b> a <b>rubber</b> bushing transmits the torque of the drive shaft to the propeller's hub. Under a {{damaging}} load the friction of the bushing in the hub is overcome and the rotating propeller slips on the shaft, preventing overloading of the engine's components. After such an event the rubber bushing may be damaged. If so, it may continue to transmit reduced power at low revolutions, but may provide no power, due to reduced friction, at high revolutions. Also, the rubber bushing may perish over time leading to its failure under loads below its designed failure load.|$|R
50|$|The Falcon had a fixed {{conventional}} undercarriage {{with twin}} sprung mainwheels under the <b>engines</b> and a <b>rubber</b> sprung tailskid. The first flight - {{of about two}} minutes - was made from Friesley Field on 17 April 1921. A second equally short flight was made that day and the first public flight made the following day.|$|R
50|$|Body styles for 1935 {{included}} 2-door business coupe, convertible coupe, roadster coupe, 5-passenger coupe and trunkback sedan. Four-door offerings {{included a}} base sedan and a trunkback sedan. The cars featured Chrysler’s vaunted “Floating Power” <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> mounts which isolated engine vibration from the chassis. Optional features included carpeting {{for the front}} seat area, radio, twin windshield wipers and a heater.|$|R
50|$|The game {{features}} {{a story about}} a factory in which a steam <b>engine</b> produces <b>rubber</b> ducks. The player is represented by the factory technician Ron, who has to keep the machine in check. While producing ducks, the steam machine's four color-coded systems (green for steam, yellow for electricity, blue for water and red for oil) grow and the player has to keep them down by connecting entry and exit points for the respective colors. This is done by rotating the blocks on screen. When a link is completed, the gauge for that system will go down, the blocks will be removed from the screen and new blocks will be added from the top in a Tetris style.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} 1924 Chrysler {{included a}} carburetor air filter, high-compression engine, full pressure lubrication inside the engine, and an oil filter, {{at a time}} when most autos came without all these features. Among the innovations in its early years would be the first practical mass-produced four-wheel hydraulic brakes, a system nearly completely engineered by Chrysler with patents assigned to Lockheed. Chrysler pioneered <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> mounts to reduce vibration; Oilite bearings; and superfinishing for shafts.|$|R
5000|$|A more {{sophisticated}} use of compressed CO2 is to power a piston expansion engine, which {{can turn a}} large, high-pitch propeller. These engines can incorporate speed controls and multiple cylinders, and are capable of powering lightweight scale radio-controlled aircraft. Gasparin and Modela are two recent makers of CO2 <b>engines.</b> CO2, like <b>rubber,</b> is known as [...] "cold" [...] power because it becomes cooler when running, rather than hotter as combustion engines and batteries do.|$|R
50|$|In total, 540 TG&#8239;5s were built, {{with the}} last 40 {{examples}} equipped with Suspendu Amorti ("damped suspension") <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> mounts - a response to Citroën's Moteur Flottant ("floating engine") of 1932. The TG&#8239;5 briefly remained available alongside the new ZC&#8239;2 - as a result, 48 late and still unsold TG&#8239;4 and TG&#8239;5 Nervastellas and Nervasports were rebodied with aerodynamic bodywork much {{like that of the}} succeeding ZC&#8239;2 (and ZD&#8239;2) models, thus forming a sort of intermediate variant.|$|R
5000|$|After {{accepting}} {{his first}} job at Harley-Davidson, Bleustein soon became an [...] "avid biker" [...] Early in his time with the company, he was embarrassed to discover that his new Harley-Davidson Sportster was leaking oil, and this motivated him to redesign the engine to eliminate the oil leak problem. He was responsible for other engineering innovations, including <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> mounts to reduce vibration, redesign of the iconic Harley-Davidson V-twin engine, and introduction of Kevlar drive belts.|$|R
5000|$|Erling Poppe’s {{design was}} {{originally}} {{based on a}} captured BMW R75 but so soon {{after the end of}} the war BSA did not want the S series to look too [...] "German", so an in-line OHC, parallel twin was designed instead of a flat twin [...] "across the frame". Serious problems with vibration made the new Sunbeam bikes uncomfortable to ride and the initial production originally sent to South Africa was recalled. The excessive vibration was cured by mounting the engine on two bonded <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> mounts.|$|R
5000|$|The FLT Tour Glide was {{introduced}} in 1979 as a 1980 model. [...] Sold alongside the existing FLH Electra Glide, the FLT had a larger frame with <b>rubber</b> <b>engine</b> mounts, a five-speed transmission, the [...] engine, and a frame-mounted fairing. In order that the FLT frame, which was larger and heavier than the large and heavy FLH frame, would handle acceptably, the front forks were given radical steering geometry which had them mounted behind the steering head, with the frame behind the steering head being recessed to allow adequate steering lock.|$|R
