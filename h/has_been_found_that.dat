5|$|Women are {{negatively}} {{affected by the}} geographic bias within implementation of the current healthcare system in India. Of all health workers in the country, nearly two thirds are men. This especially affects rural areas where it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> out of all doctors, only 6 percent are women. This translates into approximately 0.5 female allopathic physicians per 10,000 individuals in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|Angle-resolved low-coherence {{interferometry}} (a/LCI) uses {{scattered light}} {{to measure the}} sizes of subcellular objects, including cell nuclei. This allows interferometry depth measurements to be combined with density measurements. Various correlations have been found between the state of tissue health and the measurements of subcellular objects. For example, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> as tissue changes from normal to cancerous, the average cell nuclei size increases.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{presence}} of auxins in Lactifluus piperatus metabolites, it can be applied as a rooting hormone to aid the growth of seedlings of various species of plants, including hazel, beech and oak. In the 19th century, it was used as a folk cure for tuberculosis, though it had no effect. In more recent times, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> L. piperatus can be used as an antiviral agent, and the latex has been used against viral warts.|$|E

5|$|Bicycles {{have been}} constructed, for {{investigation}} and demonstration purposes, with the steering reversed so that turning the handlebars {{to the left}} causes the front wheel {{to turn to the}} right, and vica versa. It is possible to ride such a bicycle, but it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> riders experienced with normal bicycles find it very difficult to learn, if they can manage it at all.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{areas are}} often located 100km (60mi) or more, {{offshore}} from the nest sites, although when feeding their young, the birds venture out only half that distance. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> adults bringing fish to their chicks tend {{to arrive in}} groups. This is thought to benefit the bird by reducing kleptoparasitism by the Arctic skua which harasses puffins until they drop their fish loads. Predation by the great skua (Catharacta skua) is also reduced by several birds arriving simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{the western}} cicada killer wasp {{is capable of}} {{thermoregulation}} which enables them to maintain territories during the day. A study by Joseph R. Coelho showed that during territorial patrolling the species had a high and regulated thorax temperature. Experiments found that the wasp {{has the ability to}} shift heat from its thorax to its abdomen and that the abdomen is generally kept colder than the thorax. Dead wasps that were placed in the sun reached abnormally high temperatures when compared to those on nearby plants.|$|E

Gnetophyte fossils <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{date from the}} Permian and the Triassic. Fossils {{dating back to the}} Jurassic <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found,</b> though whether or not they belong to the gnetophytes is uncertain. Overall, the fossil record is richest in the early Cretaceous, with fossils of plants, seeds, and pollen <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> can clearly <b>be</b> assigned to the gnetophytes.|$|R

5|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> urban {{populations of}} common toad occupying small areas and {{isolated}} by development show {{a lower level}} of genetic diversity and reduced fitness as compared to nearby rural populations. The researchers demonstrated this by genetic analysis and by noting the greater number of physical abnormalities among urban as against rural tadpoles when raised in a controlled environment. It was considered that long term depletion in numbers and habitat fragmentation can reduce population persistence in such urban environments.|$|E
5|$|New {{materials}} {{may make}} even better collectors. One such material {{is inspired by}} the Namib Desert beetle, which survives only on the moisture it extracts from the atmosphere. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> its back is coated with microscopic projections: the peaks are hydrophilic and the troughs are hydrophobic. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have emulated this capability by creating a textured surface that combines alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{densities of}} wood turtle populations {{have also been}} studied. In the {{northern}} portion of its range (Quebec and other areas of Canada), populations are fairly dilute, containing an average of 0.44 individuals per , while in the south, over the same area, the densities varied largely from 6 to 90 turtles. In addition to this, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> colonies often have more females than males.|$|E

The new codes have parameters [102, 17, 37], [60, 20, 17], [84, 21, 27], [105, 21, 36], and [100, 25, 30]. Also, 39 other quasi-cyclic codes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> improve the parameter sets of previously known quasi-cyclic codes.

5|$|The sponge {{benefits}} {{from the fact that}} living on the scallop prevents it from being buried in sediment. In the wild it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the scallops and their encrusting sponges both grow to a larger size in areas of high turbidity. A laboratory study showed that, in conditions where the sediment was frequently stirred up, sponges on empty scallop shells all died while those on living shells flourished. However, another study showed that growth rates in scallops heavily encrusted by sponges were significantly lower than in unencumbered ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the forewing is super-hydrophobic; it is covered with minute waxy cones, blunt spikes that create a {{water-repellent}} film. Rain rolls across the surface, removing dirt in the process. In the absence of rain, dew condenses on the wings. When the droplets coalesce, they leap several millimetres into the air, which also serves to clean the wings. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> bacteria landing on the wing surface are not repelled, rather their membranes are torn apart by the nanoscale-sized spikes, making the wing surface the first-known biomaterial that can kill bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} from the Sun breaks water molecules apart, {{reducing the amount of}} water available to form noctilucent clouds. The radiation is known to vary cyclically with the solar cycle and satellites have been tracking the decrease in brightness of the clouds with the increase of ultraviolet radiation for the last two solar cycles. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> changes in the clouds follow changes in the intensity of ultraviolet rays by about a year, but the reason for this long lag is not yet known.|$|E

5|$|When both {{rates of}} {{movement}} are known, the space {{velocity of the}} star relative to the Sun or the galaxy can be computed. Among nearby stars, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> younger population I stars have generally lower velocities than older, population II stars. The latter have elliptical orbits that are inclined to {{the plane of the}} galaxy. A comparison of the kinematics of nearby stars has allowed astronomers to trace their origin to common points in giant molecular clouds, and are referred to as stellar associations.|$|E
5|$|Although the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia share English as {{a common}} oral and written language, ASL is not {{mutually}} intelligible with British Sign Language (BSL) or Auslan. All three languages show degrees of borrowing from English, but this alone is not sufficient for cross-language comprehension. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> a relatively high percentage (37–44%) of ASL signs have similar translations in Auslan, which for oral languages would suggest that they {{belong to the same}} language family. However, this does not seem justified historically for ASL and Auslan, and it is likely that this resemblance is due to the higher degree of iconicity in sign languages in general, as well as contact with English.|$|E
5|$|Barnacles are {{normally}} sessile animals unable to evade predators. When they {{are attached to}} a scallop they benefit from the defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation. The scallop is disadvantaged because the presence of barnacles may reduce its ability to swim. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> encrusting sponges emit chemicals that discourage barnacle larvae from settling nearby. The larvae preferentially settle on shells that are not encrusted with sponges. This is another way in which encrusting sponges are of advantage to the scallops which are less impeded {{in their ability to}} swim by sponges than they are by barnacles.|$|E

5|$|However, {{contemporary}} {{records show}} that his grandfather, Lafayette Waterbury, was a veterinarian, not a rancher, and was not wealthy. Hubbard was actually raised in a townhouse {{in the center of}} Helena. According to his aunt, his family did not own a ranch but did own one cow and four or five horses on a few acres of land outside the city. Hubbard lived over a hundred miles from the Blackfeet reservation. While some sources support Scientology's claim of Hubbard's blood brotherhood, other sources say that the tribe did not practice blood brotherhood and no evidence <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> he had ever been a Blackfeet blood brother.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{dermatologist}} Frederick Parkes Weber {{wrote an}} article about von Recklinghausen disease in the British Journal of Dermatology. erroneously citing Merrick {{as an example of}} the disease, which German pathologist Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen had described in 1882, but in the last year <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> this conjecture was wrong. In fact, symptoms that are always present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin, and (which is a peculiar characteristic of this disease) the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called café au lait spots.; however, these spots were never observed on Merrick's body. For this reason, although this diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnosis were advanced, such as those of who suffer Maffucci syndrome and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (Albright's disease).|$|E
5|$|Like other mouse lemurs, {{the gray}} mouse lemur uses {{what has been}} {{described}} as a harmonic whistle call that is lower in frequency and shorter in duration than its close relative, the brown mouse lemur. In addition, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the types of vocalizations emitted by the gray mouse lemur can be dependent upon the environment. In the more open dry forest habitats favored by the gray mouse lemur, trill calls are more common and effective since they carry faster and are less likely to be masked by the wind, while chirp calls are more common in the brown mouse lemur, which favors closed rain forest habitats.|$|E
