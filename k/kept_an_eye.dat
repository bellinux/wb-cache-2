25|$|While Marshal Nicolas Soult invaded {{northern}} Portugal {{in early}} 1809, two other French forces stood ready {{to cooperate in}} the subjugation of Portugal. Pierre Belon Lapisse's division lurked near Ciudad Rodrigo while Victor's I Corps operated in the Tagus valley. A weak force under Robert Thomas Wilson watched Lapisse while Alexander Randoll Mackenzie's Anglo-Portuguese corps <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> on Victor. After being outgeneraled by Wilson, Lapisse marched south to join Victor. When Sir Arthur Wellesley's Anglo-Portuguese army advanced to attack Soult's corps, the detachment under Mayne occupied Alcántara.|$|E

She arrived penniless at Kathmandu on 29 April 1849 and was given asylum by the Maharaja of Nepal and Jung Bahadur Rana with full dignity as a Queen consort of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. A brand new residence, Charburja Durbar, {{was built in the}} Thapathali durbar complex and an allowance was set by the Nepali government.

25|$|By {{the late}} summer of 1805, the War of the Third Coalition was about to break out. Emperor Napoleon {{deployed}} 94,000 men to defend his possessions in Italy. Marshal André Masséna had 68,000 men in the main army, the satellite Kingdom of Italy added 8,000, and an observation corps of 18,000 <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> on the Kingdom of Naples. Against Napoleon's empire, the Austrian army in Italy under Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen ranged 90,000 men. Neapolitan army of King Ferdinand IV counted a mere 22,000 soldiers. Afraid that the French might invade his domain, the king concluded a treaty with Napoleon to remain neutral. In exchange, the French agreed to evacuate Apulia in southern Italy. The treaty was ratified in Naples on 3 October.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon ordered MacDonald to move {{east from}} Trilport. At 7:00 pm, the emperor {{instructed}} Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty with two divisions of cavalry to march west to capture Montmirail, followed at 3:00 am by Étienne Pierre Sylvestre Ricard's division of Marmont's corps. Ney's Young Guard divisions would move {{in their wake}} at 6:00 am while Mortier's Old Guard would march directly from Sézanne to Montmirail. Jean François Leval's division was detached from Oudinot and ordered to march to Montmirail via La Ferté-Gaucher. Napoleon posted Marmont at Étoges with Joseph Lagrange's division and the I Cavalry Corps. Using his central position, Napoleon hoped to smash Sacken and Yorck while they were isolated from Blücher. Accordingly, he ordered MacDonald to retake Château-Thierry and its vital bridge while Marmont <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> on Blücher.|$|E
25|$|The other {{lead that}} was {{discarded}} {{was one that}} suggested that Tobares was kidnapped for ransom, mainly because his possible abductors have not reached out to his family for a payment. They <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> for any activity on Tobares' bank accounts {{to see if they}} were used after he went missing. Investigators analyzed his latest activity on social media as well. His last activity was on Facebook, where Tobares made a profile picture change on May 28, a few days before he went missing. Investigators believe that Tobares was probably hired as a cook by a drug lord for a party or event without him knowing who he was cooking for. At some point, investigators alleged, Tobares might have seen something suspicious that put him in danger, or might have had a problem with someone at those private events. In addition, investigators concluded that Tobares might have been a victim of gang retaliation. They allege that rival gang members might have kidnapped Tobares {{to send a message to}} his employers.|$|E

In the film, Pym was an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. until his wife Janet van Dyne shrunk to the Quantum Realm during one of their missions and discovered that the organization was trying to replicate his Pym Particle formula. After quitting, he builds his own company Pym Technologies, but is ousted as CEO by his former protege Darren Cross and his estranged daughter Hope van Dyne. Although they still <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> on Cross of any suspicious activity, Cross comes close to perfecting Pym's formula and plans to sell the Yellowjacket suit, Pym manipulated former thief Scott Lang into stealing the suit and eventually instructing Scott {{to be the new}} Ant-Man to stop Cross. He refused to have Hope in danger despite his daughter's superior experience, afraid that he'd lose Hope like Janet. After discovering that Ant-Man had returned from the Quantum Realm following his fight with Yellowjacket, Pym believed that Wasp is still alive there. In the mid-credits scene, Pym presents an updated Wasp costume to Hope, deciding to give it to his daughter.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} was between Edge and John Cena for the WWE Championship. In this match, the {{stipulation}} {{was that if}} Edge got disqualified, he would lose the title to Cena. During the match, Cena used several blows and slams on Edge. He also performed a belly-to-belly suplex on Edge and <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> on Edge's valet, the WWE Women's Champion Lita. Edge took advantage and connected with chokeholds and a flying clothesline, but Cena was able to recover. Lita tried to interfere, but Edge warned her not to get him disqualified. Lita threw a steel chair into the ring, but Edge threw it back outside the ring, and Cena took advantage. Cena then applied the STFU on Edge. Lita tried to interfere again, but Edge warned her once again. Edge {{made it to the}} ropes, and while the referee told Cena to break the hold, Lita handed Edge a pair of brass knuckles. As Cena broke the hold, Cena put Edge on his shoulders again for the FU, but this time Lita jumped on Edge's back when Cena had Edge set up for the FU, and Lita was the recipient of the FU instead of Edge. Edge then jumped off of Cena's back and hit Cena {{in the back of the}} head with the brass knuckles to win the match and retain his championship.|$|E
25|$|Lady Cripps {{returned}} to England with her sick grandson. Just before Christmas 1962, Joe {{was released from}} prison and allowed to return to legal practice. The anxieties of the final years of the Nkrumah regime were relieved in 1966, by the coup that ousted Nkrumah. In the years that followed, as her children were abroad at boarding schools and universities, and her husband was active once more in Ghanaian politics and as an ambassador for the nation, she stayed mostly in Kumasi, providing the base from which he could travel out into the world, secure in the knowledge that Peggy was taking care of things on the home front. She <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> on the properties he had inherited from his grand-uncle. Despite her family's extensive political involvements, Peggy herself was not particularly interested in party politics. She supported her husband, of course. But her own contributions were through the wide range of social work she engaged in. Having learned Twi, the language of the Asante, she became interested in and knowledgeable about Akan art and folklore, as she acquired a major goldweight collection, began collecting and translating proverbs, and learned Ananse stories, many of them from her husband. For three decades, a visit to her house and her goldweight collection was {{one of the highlights of}} a visit to Ashanti for visitors interested in its art.|$|E

Three years after the meeting, and one year after the University of Georgia's violent integration, Georgia Tech became the first university in the Deep South to desegregate without a court order, with Ford Greene, Ralph A. Long, Jr., and Lawrence Michael Williams becoming Georgia Tech's first three African American students; they registered for class on September 18, 1963 and started class on September 20. Members of the press were barred from the campus to discourage disruptive behavior, and plainclothes police officers were placed on the campus.

Lancaster's marketing vice president Catherine Walsh remarked in a statement: [...] "The worst thing in the world would be to unplug Glow to introduce Still". Still Jennifer Lopez was released in October 2003. While Glow by JLo was aimed at the female market at girls between the age of 15 and 25, Still Jennifer Lopez was aimed to appeal to an older demographic of females 25 and above, according to Rebecca Murray of About.com.|$|E

500|$|In October 1967, {{recording}} {{sessions for}} the second Jimi Hendrix Experience album [...] began at Olympic Studios in London. [...] On October 25, after recording the strongly R [...] "Wait Until Tomorrow", the Experience recorded an instrumental version of [...] "Little Wing". [...] It followed the same chord progression as the later master recording, but had a more forceful rock feel. After another take in the same vein, Chandler called for a different approach. [...] Recording engineer Eddie Kramer explained, [...] "Chas knew right away what was needed. [...] He had Jimi slow the tempo down and try it again". [...] After the basic track was completed, Hendrix and Kramer recorded overdubs on October 28, 1967. [...] For his recordings, Hendrix expended considerable effort to achieve the optimal tone for his guitar tracks. [...] For his rhythm guitar, he had set his pickup selector to a nonstandard position between the neck and middle settings to achieve a [...] "hollow" [...] tone, sometimes mistakenly referred to as [...] "out-of-phase". [...] However, for the lead, Kramer later fed the guitar signal through a makeshift Leslie speaker, which was normally used for electric organs. By rotating the sound, Leslie speakers produce vibrato- and tremolo-like effects, i.e., a pulsing or quivering addition to the sound (Hendrix later popularized {{the use of the}} Univibe phase shifter effects pedal, which can be set to get a roughly similar effect). [...] Next, Hendrix added a straight ("dry, without any effects") glockenspiel to underscore his vocal and guitar. [...] According to Kramer, [...] "Jimi always <b>kept</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> out for odd instruments that would be lying about the studio" [...] and found the glockenspiel in Studio A. [...] Last to be recorded was his vocal, which was treated with sound processing techniques to give it an airy sound. [...] These have been variously described as artificial double tracking (ADT), phasing, Pultec filter equalization, and processing with a Leslie speaker.|$|E
500|$|In {{the general}} {{distribution}} of estates which occurred after 1534, Bombay Island was leased to Mestre Diogo {{for an annual}} rent of 1,432½ pardaos (about Rs. 537-3-0), payable at the royal treasury in Bassein. Mahim was similarly rented for 36,057 foedeas (Rs. 751-3-0), the custom house of Mahim for 39,975 foedeas (Rs. 791-2-9), and [...] Mazagon for 8,500 foedeas (Rs. 178). The San Miguel (St. Michael's Church) in Mahim, the oldest Portuguese Franciscan church in Bombay, was built in 1534. Bombay was placed under the spiritual jurisdiction of the Vigario da Vara at Bassein. Under his auspices, the Franciscan Order was established. The Jesuit Order was established in 1542, the most notable member {{of which was the}} Navarrese Jesuit Francis Xavier. The Dominican Order established in Goa in 1545, was established in Bombay in 1548. The Portuguese called the islands by various names like Mombai, Mombay, Mombayn, Mombaym, and Bombai, which finally took the written form Bombaim, still common in current Portuguese use. After the British gained possession, it was believed to be anglicised to Bombay from the Portuguese Bombaim. Between 1545 and 1548, during the viceroyalty of João de Castro (1545-7), the four villages of Parel, Wadala, Sion, and Worli were granted to Manuel Serrão for an annual payment of 412 pardaos (Rs. 154-8-0). Salsette was granted for three years to João Rodrigues Dantas, Cosme Corres, and Manuel Corres. Trombay and Chembur were granted to Roque Tello de Menezes, and the Island of Pory (Elephanta Island) to João Pirez in 1548 [...] for 105 pardaos (Rs. 39-6-0). The revenue of the custom house at Walkeshwar was granted to a Portuguese officer for 60 foedeas (Rs. 1-4-0). Mazagaon was granted to António Pessoa. In 1554, during the viceroyalty of Pedro Mascarenhas, the seven islands of Bombay were leased to Garcia de Orta, a Portuguese physician and botanist, for a yearly rent equivalent to about £85 sterling.
