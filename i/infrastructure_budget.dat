2500|$|... 83.5% of {{the borough}} was officially defined as {{conservation}} space; however, {{the increase in}} illegal settlements and logging has been eroding this percentage. The forests {{are important to the}} Valley of Mexico/Mexico City as they not only release oxygen into the air, they are an important area for the recharge of the valley’s aquifers. Wells from this borough provide 70% of Mexico City’s potable water. The borough has 120 wells for potable water (out of a total of 450 in the District), which extract about 60 liters each second from each well. However, water shortages are relatively common in the borough proper. Most of {{this is due to the}} lack of wells, drilling equipment and pipelines to serve local residents, with the city authorities only reserving less than a fifth of its <b>infrastructure</b> <b>budget</b> for works in Tlalpan. One serious outage of water occurred in 2001 when thirty nine of the borough’s colonias were without dependable water for two weeks because of the lack of water reserves. Deforestation and other ecological damage make a number of areas susceptible to flooding during the rainy season from June to October. These include Anillo Periférico, Renato Leduc, Boulevard de la Luz and the Picacho Highway. Forest fires are a common problem not only in the Bosque de Tlalpan but also in Parque Fuentes Brotantes, Parque Ciudad de Mexico and the Cerro de Zacatepetl.|$|E

2500|$|Infrastructure {{work now}} began in Marshall Heights. A city survey in 1949 found that just 30 {{percent of all}} homes in Marshall Heights had access to running water and the city sewer system. City {{engineers}} estimated in May 1950 {{that it would take}} $2 million to give the 500 homes in Marshall Heights water and sewer lines, and to grade and pave every street. But with an annual <b>infrastructure</b> <b>budget</b> of just $1 million a year for the entire city, they said improvements in Marshall Heights would take time. Nevertheless, the District agreed to spend $320,000 on water and sewer mains, and paving secondary streets, in 1950 alone. Paving of main streets, and adding sidewalks, curbs, and gutters was not planned, as this was not deemed urgent. By November, 30 homes on five blocks between E. 50th and E. 51st Streets had received water and sewer mains. Another $100,000 was spent on Marshall Heights infrastructure in 1952. By the end of 1952, 134 homes in Marshall Heights had water and sewer. But only 72 homeowners had actually hooked up to the system. City officials said the cost of a hookup, which ran from $1,000 to $1,500, and the $135 frontage fee were simply too high for most residents to afford. The city had the option of going to court to force residents to hookup and pay the frontage fee, but officials said this was useless because residents simply didn't have the income. Spending large amounts of money on Marshall Heights deeply angered some city officials. William H. Cary, Jr., director of the D.C. Bureau of Public Health Engineering, claimed, [...] "This will never be a place the District government will be proud of." [...] But work continued, and additional street grading and water and sewer lines were laid in 1957. [...] To counteract criticism that Marshall Heights residents didn't care about their neighborhood, the Marshall Heights Civic Association engaged in a two-month-long campaign to remove trash and weeds, sweep streets, improve empty lots, and generally eliminate blight from the neighborhood. The campaign won extensive media notice. The city spent a total of $700,000 on roads and water and sewer lines by the end of 1958.|$|E

The campaign aims to raise public awareness of the scale of the road injury problem and to present this as a key issue for sustainable development. The Make Roads Safe campaign argues that tackling road injuries is vital for achieving many of the Millennium Development Goals, including targets for child mortality and health and education targets, because of the vital role played by access to roads in delivering these services. The campaign claims that, although the G8 has approved $1.2 billion for new road infrastructure in Africa, only $20 million has been allocated for road safety measures. The campaign argues that at least 10% of this <b>infrastructure</b> <b>budget,</b> and the similar budgets deployed worldwide by the World Bank, regional development banks and other donors, should be dedicated to road safety measures. If this principle was accepted in the case of Africa it would mean $120 million would be available for road safety measures such as safety assessments of road design, enforcement and education strategies.|$|E
