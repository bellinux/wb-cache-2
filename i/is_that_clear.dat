40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} partisanship and cities ’ approaches to climate policy. Do partisan patterns {{at the local level}} match those we observe at the national level? Whose partisanship matters: that of elected officials, citizens, or other actors? Previous research indicates that constraints created by the federal system dampen the effects of partisanship on many local policies. Given the absence of strong federal policy direction in the environmental policy arena, this paper’s hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>clear</b> partisan differences should emerge at the local level. Employing data from a recent survey of local government officials, the analysis provides evidence that the specific constituencies targeted by a given policy affect whose partisanship matters. These effects remain robust after accounting for the broader partisan environment. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the determinants of local climate policy and for our growing knowledge of the influence of partisanship in local politics.

30|$|The current {{approach}} {{for the assessment}} of the effects on NTO applied by the applicants in the applications reviewed {{is based on the assumption}} that a GMP consists of two parts that function in a linear additive fashion: the crop and the novel GM transgene product. Based on the substantial equivalence concept and when no statistically relevant compositional changes are detected, the crop plant as such is declared as safe and, consequently, only the added transgene product is subject to testing in the ERA. This approach to the assessment of NTOs is highly disputed in the scientific community [6, 37 – 40] and fails to comply with the provisions put forward by Directive 2001 / 18 /EC [41, 7]. A consequence of this interpretation of the legal and scientific requirements for ERA <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>clear</b> risk research hypotheses are often not formulated and tested for the GMP in question. Hence, the assessment lacks a well-founded exposure analysis of the GMP in its receiving environments and meaningful testing of the selected NTOs from these environments.|$|E
40|$|This {{exploratory}} study assesses {{the information technology}} (IT) skill requirements in the 30 most frequently advertised occupations in the United States. On the basis of approximately two million job advertisements, we examine the IT skill requirements of each occupation, making the distinction between basic or general, intermediate and advanced IT skills. For each of these categories, we consider a range of IT skills, such as general computer skills, word processing and spreadsheets, programming and data management. For most occupations {{only a few of}} these skills are relevant, but there are exceptions. One particularly interesting finding <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>clear</b> patterns emerge: the share of vacancies that refer to each of the IT skills increases as occupations become more complex. At the same time, there is a hierarchy when different IT skills are compared to each other: general computer skills, for example, are more frequently listed than more complex or specialised skills. The IT requirements listed in vacancies are highly consistent with the skills and tasks associated with the corresponding occupations in occupational classifications such as ISCO or O*NET...|$|E

An essential requirement for the validity of consent <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>clear,</b> exhaustive and adequate information be provided to the patient himself: the practice of informed consent is a communicative relationship in which the patient can express doubts, perplexities and clarification requests to the dentist. Furthermore, dental treatment has specific peculiarities: the relationship between dentistry and aesthetics, the concomitant presence of pathologies requiring different treatments, the elongated care process and the establishment of a trustworthy relationship and familiarity with the patient represent important aspects in the configuration of the dentistpatient relationship and in the process of acquiring informed consent. The dentist must offer correct information on diagnosis, prognosis, the therapeutic perspective and the likely consequences of therapy, alternative therapy and refusal of therapy, as well as eventual commitments for the period after treatment. Particular consideration must be given to minors and patients of unsound mind: the dentist’s approach to these patients needs to be clear and appropriate to the person’s age and understanding ability, even if the decisional power for sanitary treatment may {{be in the hands of}} a third person...|$|E

40|$|Using a peroxidase-antiperoxidase {{staining}} procedure, formalin fixed paraffin embedded {{sections of}} fetal and normal kidney; benign (mesoblastic nephroma); and malignant tumours (Wilms' tumour, clear cell renal carcinoma, rhabdoid renal tumour, and bone metastasising renal tumour of childhood (BMRTC] were examined for their reactivity with antisera to fibronectin, laminin, and epithelial membrane antigen. Mesoblastic nephroma contained fibronectin but no laminin. Most Wilms' tumours lacked both fibronectin and laminin; 50 % of rhabdoid renal tumours were positive for fibronectin and laminin [...] rhabdoid tumours as recognised morphologically may, in fact, be two separate entities. BMRTC and clear cell renal carcinoma lacked both fibronectin and laminin. Epithelial membrane antigen {{was present in}} most of the tubular Wilms' tumour but absent in blastemal Wilms' tumours. The presence of epithelial membrane antigen in rhabdoid tumours was surprising, as histologically, this type of tumour shows no sign of epithelial differentiation. Epithelial membrane antigen antiserum stained clear cell renal carcinomas: epithelial membrane antigen is found in the distal and not the proximal tubules of fetal and normal kidneys. Thus an obvious interpretation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>clear</b> cell renal carcinomas originate from distal rather than from proximal tubules, as has always been thought. On the basis of these results and data from other published findings some possible histogenetic origins of childhood renal tumours were proposed...|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{relationship}} between two research topics: digital scholarship and faculty development. The former topic drives attention on academics’ new practices in digital, open and networked contexts; the second is focused on the requirements and strategies to promote academics’ professional learning and career advancement. The research question addressing this study is: are faculty development strategies hindered by the lack of a cohesive view in the research on digital scholarship? The main assumption guiding this research question <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>clear</b> conceptual frameworks and models of professional practice lead to effective faculty development strategies. Through a wide overview of the evolution of both digital scholarship and faculty development, followed by a conceptual analysis of the intersections between fields, the paper attempts to show the extent on which the situation in one area (digital scholarship) might encompass criticalities for the other (faculty development) in terms of research and practices. Furthermore, three scenarios based on the several perspectives of digital scholarship are built in order to explore the research question in depth. We conclude that at the current state of art the relationship between these two topics is weak. Moreover, the dialogue between digital scholarship and faculty development could put the basis to forge effective professional learning contexts and instruments, with the ultimate goal of supporting academics to become digital scholars towards a more open and democratic vision of scholarship.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} genetically remove {{specific}} components of various cell signalling cascades {{has been an}} integral tool in modern signal transduction analysis. One particular method to achieve this conditional deletion is via {{the use of the}} Cre-loxP system. This method involves flanking the gene of interest with loxP sites, which are specific recognition sequences for the Cre recombinase protein. Exposure of the so-called floxed (flanked by loxP site) DNA to this enzyme results in a Cre-mediated recombination event at the loxP sites, and subsequent excision of the intervening gene 3. Several different methods exist to administer Cre recombinase to the site of interest. In this video, we demonstrate the use of an adenovirus containing the Cre recombinase gene to infect primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) obtained from embryos containing a floxed Rac 1 allele 1. Our rationale for selecting Rac 1 MEFs for our experiments <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>clear</b> morphological changes can be seen upon deletion of Rac 1, due to alterations in the actin cytoskeleton 2, 5. 72 hours following viral transduction and Cre expression, cells were stained using the actin dye phalloidin and imaged using confocal laser scanning microscopy. It was observed that MEFs which had been exposed to the adeno-Cre virus appeared contracted and elongated in morphology compared to uninfected cells, consistent with previous reports 2, 5. The adenovirus method of Cre recombinase delivery is advantageous as the adeno-Cre virus is easily available, and gene deletion via Cre in nearly 100 % of the cells ca...|$|E
