5|$|On 9 September 2013 in the UK (and a {{day later}} in the US), the Clash {{released}} Sound System, a twelve-disc box set featuring their studio albums completely re-mastered on eight discs with an additional three discs featuring demos, non-album singles, rarities and B-sides, a DVD with previously unseen footage by both Don Letts and Julien Temple, original promo videos and live footage, an owner's manual booklet, reprints of the band's original 'Armagideon Times' fanzine {{as well as a}} brand new edition curated and designed by Paul Simonon and merchandise including dog tags, badges, stickers and an exclusive Clash poster. Both Mick Jones and Paul Simonon oversaw the project including the re-masters. The box set came in a package shaped as an 80s ghetto blaster. The box set was accompanied by 5 Album Studio Set, which contains only the first five studio albums (excluding Cut the Crap), and The Clash Hits Back, a 33-track, two-CD best of collection sequenced to copy the set played by the band at the Brixton <b>Fair</b> <b>Deal</b> (now the Academy) on 19 July 1982.|$|E

50|$|Under the 1988 Act, it was {{originally}} the case that any research use was <b>fair</b> <b>dealing.</b> However, in 2003, the 1988 Act was amended to exclude commercial research from the definition of <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> because of the restrictions provided for by the Copyright Directive. <b>Fair</b> <b>dealing</b> for research should be accompanied by acknowledgement if this is possible. <b>Fair</b> <b>dealing</b> with the typographical arrangement of a work for the use in research or private study is also explicitly allowed. Also before the 2014 amendments to UK copyright law <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> for research only covered literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fair</b> <b>dealing</b> {{is to be}} {{examined}} on a case-by-case basis. The purpose of the dealing, character of the dealing, amount of the dealing, alternatives of the dealing, {{nature of the work}} and effect of the dealing are factors that can contribute to <b>fair</b> <b>dealing.</b> Those favouring a broad interpretation of <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> argue there ought to be reasonable unauthorized reproduction of works because it facilitates creativity and free expression. They also argue that <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> provides reasonable access to existing knowledge. Those arguing that <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> ought to be more restrictive and specific state that <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> will reduce revenue to those creating works. They also argue the reproduction of works and sends a wrong message to the public that works are free as long as it falls under this banner. Their economic argument is that <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> should not compensate for the market's inability to meet the demand for public knowledge.|$|R

25|$|Modern {{liberalism}} {{took shape}} during the twentieth century, with roots in Theodore Roosevelt's New Nationalism, Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom, Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, Harry S. Truman's <b>Fair</b> <b>Deal,</b> John F. Kennedy's New Frontier, and Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society. American liberals oppose conservatives on most issues, but not all. Modern liberalism is historically related to social liberalism and progressivism, though the current relationship between liberal and progressive viewpoints is debated.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fair</b> <b>dealing</b> allows {{specific}} exceptions to copyright protections. The open-ended concept of fair use {{is generally not}} observed in jurisdictions where <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> is in place, although this does vary. <b>Fair</b> <b>dealing</b> is established in legislation in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, India, South Africa and the United Kingdom, among others.|$|R
50|$|There are {{significant}} differences between Canadian <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> and US <b>fair</b> use. The most important is the fixed list of permissible purposes for <b>fair</b> <b>dealing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Copyright Act of Canada {{establishes}} <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> in Canada, {{which allows}} specific exceptions to copyright protection. In 1985, the Sub-Committee on the Revision of Copyright rejected replacing <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> with an open-ended system, and in 1986 the Canadian government agreed that [...] "the present <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> provisions {{should not be}} replaced by the substantially wider 'fair use' concept". Since then, the Canadian <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> exception has broadened. It is now similar in effect to U.S. fair use, even though the frameworks are different.|$|R
25|$|From 1947 to 1949, {{when the}} Republicans {{controlled}} the Senate, Taft was his party's leading voice in domestic policy. He {{was reluctant to}} support farm subsidies, a position that hurt the party in rural areas (especially in the Midwest) in the 1948 elections. Taft engineered {{the passage of the}} Housing Act of 1949, which funded slum clearance and the construction of 810,000 units of low-income housing over a period of six years. It {{was one of the few}} <b>Fair</b> <b>Deal</b> proposals of Truman that he liked.|$|E
25|$|During a {{demonstration}} of the E.28/39 to Winston Churchill in April 1943, Whittle proposed to Stafford Cripps, Minister of Aircraft Production, that all jet development be nationalised. He pointed out that the company had been funded by private investors who helped develop the engine successfully, only to see production contracts go to other companies. Nationalisation {{was the only way to}} repay those debts and ensure a <b>fair</b> <b>deal</b> for everyone, and he was willing to surrender his shares in Power Jets to make this happen. In October, Cripps told Whittle that he decided a better solution would be to nationalise Power Jets only.|$|E
25|$|Even {{despite the}} Court's evident lack {{of sympathy for}} the broad claims of {{inherent}} power made by the government, Truman and many other observers expected the Court to uphold his authority {{to act in the}} absence of express statutory authorization. Many commentators predicted that the Court would avoid the constitutional question, while others stressed the background that all of the Justices had in the New Deal and <b>Fair</b> <b>Deal,</b> when the powers of the Presidency had expanded greatly, and the past support of Justices such as Black, Reed, Frankfurter, and Douglas for the expansive application of the President's war powers.|$|E
50|$|In South Africa, <b>fair</b> <b>dealing</b> is {{dealt with}} in the Copyright Act of 1978 (Act 98 of 1978, {{including}} subsequent amendments). <b>Fair</b> <b>dealing</b> itself is described in section 12(1) of the Act, whereas sections 13 to 19 explains various exceptions to copyright.

25|$|Historians {{generally}} {{agree that}} during Roosevelt's 12 years in office, {{there was a}} dramatic increase {{in the power of the}} federal government as a whole. Roosevelt also established the presidency as the prominent center of authority within the federal government. Roosevelt created a large array of agencies protecting various groups of citizens—workers, farmers, and others—who suffered from the crisis, and thus enabled them to challenge the powers of the corporations. In this way, the Roosevelt Administration generated a set of political ideas—known as New Deal liberalism—that remained a source of inspiration and controversy for decades. New Deal liberalism lay the foundation of a new consensus. Between 1940 and 1980 there was the liberal consensus about the prospects for the widespread distribution of prosperity within an expanding capitalist economy. Especially Harry S. Truman's <b>Fair</b> <b>Deal</b> and in the 1960s, Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society used the New Deal as inspiration for a dramatic expansion of liberal programs.|$|E

500|$|Seward's biographers {{suggested}} {{that there are two}} faces to Seward. [...] One, [...] "John Quincy Adams Seward", dreamed big dreams and tried to convey them in speeches, working to achieve education for all, a <b>fair</b> <b>deal</b> for immigrants, an end to slavery, and an expanded America. The other, [...] "Thurlow Weed Seward", cut backroom deals over cigars and a bottle, and was a pragmatist who often settled for half a loaf when the whole was not achievable. Daniel S. Crofts, in Seward's entry in American National Biography argued, [...] "Each Seward was, of course, a caricature, and both tendencies, at once symbiotic and contradictory, existed in tandem." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Fair</b> <b>dealing</b> is not {{the same}} as fair use.

500|$|As he readied for the 1948 election, Truman {{made clear}} his {{identity}} as a Democrat in the New Deal tradition, advocating national health insurance, and repeal of the Taft–Hartley Act. He broke with the New Deal by initiating an aggressive civil rights program, which he termed a moral priority. Taken together, it constituted a broad legislative agenda {{that came to be}} called the [...] "Fair Deal." [...] Truman's proposals were not well received by Congress, even with renewed Democratic majorities in Congress after 1948. The Solid South rejected civil rights, as those states still enforced segregation. Only one of the major <b>Fair</b> <b>Deal</b> bills, the Housing Act of 1949, was ever enacted. On the other hand, the major New Deal programs still in operation were not repealed, and there were minor improvements and extensions in many of them.|$|E
500|$|In August 1981, unity {{talks between}} the three {{organizations}} appeared to have collapsed {{as a result of}} conflicting interests. Sihanouk, who feared the resurgence of the Khmer Rouge, proposed that all resistance groups disarm themselves following the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea. Meanwhile, Son Sann demanded that the KPNLF be the lead organization within the proposed alliance, and the leaders of the Khmer Rouge [...] "most compromised" [...] by the atrocities in Kampuchea be exiled to China. Against these preconditions, Khieu Samphan reminded his rivals that the autonomy of the Khmer Rouge and Democratic Kampuchea should not be undermined. On 22 November 1982, Singapore, with the backing of ASEAN, proposed that three organizations form a coalition government with equal decision-making powers within the alliance. Singapore’s proposal was welcomed by Sihanouk, who believed it was a <b>fair</b> <b>deal</b> for the non-communist movements.|$|E
500|$|Civil rights bills, unpopular with Southern Democrats, were {{central to}} Truman's <b>Fair</b> <b>Deal.</b> Because Barkley could still appeal to Southern Democrats, Truman {{asked him to}} be the keynote speaker at the 1948 Democratic National Convention for an {{unprecedented}} third time. Because of the Republican resurgence and Truman's difficulty appealing to some Democrats, Republican presidential nominee Thomas E. Dewey was expected to win the upcoming presidential election. Democrats were energized by Barkley's keynote address, which promoted New Deal accomplishments and called the Republican-controlled Eightieth Congress a [...] "do nothing" [...] Congress. He mentioned Truman only once, leading Truman to suspect that Barkley sought to supplant him as the party's presidential nominee, but no such attempt occurred. Despite these suspicions and his contention that a ticket consisting of a Missourian and a Kentuckian lacked regional geographic balance, convention delegates persuaded Truman to take Barkley as his running mate. Truman had wanted Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, but Douglas declined.|$|E

She supports the teaching of politics in schools, as well as lowering the voting age to 16. She also believes more women should be encouraged to go into politics, and as a minister has spoken of her support for the idea of gender quotas as a way of increasing the number of female politicians. She favours the option of extending the <b>Fair</b> <b>Deal</b> scheme to include home care. Michael Brennan, of the Irish Independent has described McEntee's support of small food business as [...] "one of the brightest stories {{to come out of the}} recession". On the UK's Brexit process, McEntee has spoken of the importance of building certainty between the UK and EU: [...] "We must deal with the past and lay the foundations of a trusting relationship before we can build the future".|$|E
500|$|A new league, the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA), {{was formed}} in late November 1909. One of the teams, the All-Montreal Hockey Club, hired Ross as a playing-manager, but the league only lasted to mid-January 1910 before disbanding. Ross, who scored four goals in four games in the CHA, then signed with the Haileybury Comets of the National Hockey Association (NHA), a league formed in December 1909, which {{proved to be the}} {{stronger}} replacement to the ECAHA as the highest level of hockey in Canada. He received $2,700 to play in the 1910 season, which lasted from January to March, playing twelve games for the team and finishing with six goals. Before the following season, the NHA imposed a salary cap of $5,000 per team. The players, including Ross, were unhappy as this would result in a pay decrease, and began looking to form their own league without a cap. Ross wrote to the Montreal Herald, stating [...] "all the players want is a <b>fair</b> <b>deal</b> ... The players are not trying to bulldoze the NHA, but we want to know where we get off at." [...] The plans were abandoned when they realized all the suitable arenas would be unavailable as they were owned or leased by the NHA. Ross scored four goals in eleven games with the Wanderers, who finished fourth in the five team league. During a match against the Quebec Bulldogs on February 25, 1911, Ross knocked out Eddie Oatman in a fight, provoking a massive brawl between the two teams, which the police had to break up. The fight helped to increase the reputation Ross had as a tough player unwilling to back down from any opponent. The following season Ross had eleven goals in nineteen games as the Wanderers improved to second in the league.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{it is even}} {{necessary}} to consider <b>fair</b> <b>dealing,</b> a would-be plaintiff has the burden of establishing an alleged infringement.
