In November 1955 the <b>Independence</b> <b>Front</b> tried to oust al-Azhari through a vote in the House of Representatives. The Anti-Imperialist Front refused to support this action, and Hassan at-Taheer Zarouq abstained from voting. The Anti-Imperialist Front explained its position that it struggled for principles, rather against any particular individuals. Instead, the Anti-Imperialist Front called for a national unity government. This move alienated the Anti-Imperialist Front from both the government and the other opposition forces.|$|E

Though most of his associates abandoned him, he was reported to have continued to conduct guerrilla activities until June 1945. He was denounced by the KKE Central Committee and increasingly isolated, until he was ambushed with his unit in the mountain of Agrafa (some say that he was set up or even betrayed by KKE contacts) by para-military groups controlled by the Athens government. Although many members of the Security Battalions and the organisation X (leader of the latter was the Colonel, at the time, Georgios Grivas), were rounded up and detained in prison, the majority of their officers were allowed to join the new Greek police force, organised by the British.|$|E
50|$|Parliamentary {{elections}} {{were held in}} Hungary on 15 May 1949. The Hungarian Independent People's Front, an umbrella group created that February to replace the National <b>Independence</b> <b>Front</b> and led by the Hungarian Working People's Party (as the Hungarian Communist Party had been renamed following a merger with the Hungarian Social Democratic Party), but also including the remaining four non-communist parties, ran a single list of candidates espousing a common programme. With all organised opposition having been destroyed, and the Communists dropping all pretense of democracy, the Front won 95.6% of the vote, presaging the result of elections through 1990. 71 (17.7%) elected deputies were female, up from 22 (5.4%) elected in 1947. Some 71% of those elected belonged to the Working People's Party, and a similar proportion were workers or peasants.|$|E
50|$|In {{elections}} held in November 1945, the Smallholders Party won 57% of the vote. The Hungarian Workers Party, {{now under}} the leadership of Mátyás Rákosi and Ernő Gerő, received support from only 17% of the population. The Soviet commander in Hungary, Marshal Kliment Voroshilov, refused to allow the Smallholders to form a government. Instead Voroshilov established a coalition government with the communists holding all the key posts. Kovács became minister of agriculture (1945-46).The Hungarian Communist Party became the largest single party in the elections in 1947 and served in the coalition People's <b>Independence</b> <b>Front</b> government. The communists gradually gained control of the government and by 1948 the Smallholders Party ceased to exist as an independent organization. Kovács {{was arrested and charged with}} plotting against the occupation forces. He was found guilty and sentenced life imprisonment in Siberia.|$|E

Despite this injury, Poventud played an accordion for the occasion. In 1976, Poventud made the arrangements and was the first guitarist in Pepe and Flora's album En La Lucha.

5000|$|The speech {{undoubtedly}} helped {{propel the}} Agrarian Democrats {{to victory in}} the February 1994 election, the country's first since <b>independence.</b> The <b>Front's</b> weakening since 1990 had already shown the unpopularity of pan-Romanian notions, and Snegur's rhetoric was against union with Romania and in favour of independence and territorial integrity. At the election, the Front finished in last place of the parties elected and the PDAM's 43.2% of the vote translated into an absolute majority in parliament (56 of 104 seats). Further confirming the popularity of government policy, at a referendum the following month, 95.4% voted that Moldova should remain an [...] "independent and unitary state", while at the 1995 local elections, the party scored 47% of the vote.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{inconclusive}} war in Indochina, France's colonial empire decayed under Auriol's presidency.

France waged a brutal war of repression in Madagascar, and imprisoned Tunisian independence leader Habib Bourguiba in 1952.|$|R
50|$|He {{returns to}} his {{business}} and becomes more active than ever. He continues to serve his mandates in several enterprises, and becomes {{a director of the}} Bank van Brussel on the Kouter in Ghent and becomes chairman of the Intifil cooperative and attempts to navigate the textile industry of Ghent through the war. At the surface he behaves as a strictly neutral citizen, but form the start of the Nazi occupation he commits himselve to help the prisoners of war, the deportees and the people forced to work in Germany. He refuses to pass on the lists of his employees to the Nazis, what brings him in 1942, for the Court martial. His commitment to resisting the occupation goes even further. Already in 1940, he joins the local resistance. He founded the Ghent department of the information service Zero and is provincial agent for the Socrates group which supports people hiding from the Nazis and organised flight routes. He helps his future son-in-law, Charles Waegemans, to escape to London. Through Albert Maertens he gets involved in the distribution of underground newspapers such as The Belfort and at the activities of the Onafhankelijkheidsfront (E: <b>Independence</b> <b>Front).</b> His contacts in the financial and industrial world and his leading position within freemasonry (as chairing master of Le Septentrion) also mean an important support for the resistance movement.|$|E
5000|$|The election, by {{secret ballot}} and without census or fraud, is {{reckoned}} {{as the first}} relatively democratic election ever held in Hungary, and was certainly {{the closest thing to}} an honest election held in the country until 1990. It was also one of only two remotely free elections ever held in what would become the Soviet bloc (the other being the 1946 elections in Czechoslovakia. One author states it was [...] "generally fair, but not entirely free", as only [...] "democratic" [...] parties were allowed to compete, meaning most of the pre-war right-wing parties were excluded, as well as those parties that did not participate in the Hungarian National <b>Independence</b> <b>Front,</b> a wartime anti-fascist alliance. [...] Only the leaders of the dissolved rightist parties, SS volunteers and those interned or being prosecuted by the people's courts were barred from voting. The liberal electoral law was also supported by the Communists, who were not bothered by the failure of their proposal to field a single list of candidates {{on the part of the}} Communist-Social Democrat coalition parties, which would have ensured a majority for left-wing parties: intoxicated by their recruitment successes and misjudging the effect of the land reform on their appeal, they expected an [...] "enthralling victory" [...] (József Révai predicted winning as much as 70%). To their bitter disappointment, the result was nearly the opposite: the Independent Smallholders Party, winning the contest in all 16 districts, won 57% of the vote, the Social Democrats won slightly above and the Communists slightly below 17%, and the National Peasant Party just 7% (the rest going to the Citizen Democrats' Party and the new Hungarian Radical Party of Oszkár Jászi's followers).|$|E
40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the {{intellectual}} sphere which constituted {{the core of the}} Ghent <b>Independence</b> <b>Front,</b> a resistance movement against the German occupier during the Second World War. The <b>Independence</b> <b>Front</b> is too often defined as a communist resistance movement, despite its numerous different sections existing in Belgium. Although this epithet might be attributed to some regional sections, as commitment to the communist cause was often the backbone of the many IF cores, it is nevertheless an oversimplified point of view, in fact, the original founders of the IF in Brussels did strive to achieve a pluralistic composition including all democratic forces. In Ghent, {{it soon became clear that}} this objective would be realized. The scope of this study is threefold. First, the post-war developments of resistance movements are studied through the case of Ghent. The article is also a plea for a more nuanced approach in the research on resistance movements. The existing ideological categorisations are often historiographical constructions which do not always correspond with the historical reality. Finally, where the study of the resistance during the Second World War is concerned, we decided to leave the dominant time frame of 19401945, to make it clear that the roots of certain views and perceptions also existed outside the context of the occupation, and are therefore not inspired solely by the it...|$|E
