5|$|The {{primary risk}} factor for COPD {{globally}} is tobacco smoking. Of those who smoke about 20% will get COPD, and {{of those who are}} lifelong smokers about half will get COPD. In the United States and United Kingdom, of those with COPD, 80–95% are either current smokers or previously smoked. The likelihood of developing COPD increases with the total smoke exposure. Additionally, women are more susceptible to the harmful effects of smoke than men. In non-smokers, secondhand smoke is the cause of about 20% of cases. Other types of smoke, such as, marijuana, cigar, and water pipe smoke, also confer a risk. Water pipe smoke appears to be as harmful as smoking cigarettes. Problems from marijuana smoke may only be with heavy use. Women who smoke during pregnancy may increase the risk of COPD <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>child.</b> For the same amount of cigarette smoking, women have a higher risk of COPD than men.|$|E
25|$|Healthy narcissism {{might exist}} in all individuals. Freud {{said that this}} is an {{original}} state from which the individual develops the love object. He argued that healthy narcissism {{is an essential part of}} normal development. According to Freud, the love of the parents for their child and their attitude toward their child could be seen as a revival and reproduction of their own narcissism. The child has an omnipotence of thought; the parents stimulate that feeling because <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> they see the things that they have never reached themselves. Compared to neutral observers, parents tend to overvalue the qualities of their child. When parents act in an extreme opposite style and the child is rejected or inconsistently reinforced depending on the mood of the parent, the self-needs of the child are not met. Freud contrasts the natural development of active-egoistic and passive-altruistic tendencies in the individual with narcissism, in the former, and what Trevor Pederson refers to as echoism, in the latter.|$|E
2500|$|Epigenetics is {{referred}} to as the ‘new genetics’ and phenomenon of importance to marketers because it studies how our environment can influence our genes, and hence our behaviour. The theory of meiosis is that exact replicas of parents' genes are passed to their offspring, with no variation influence from the environment. However genes have a protein wrapping the gene that can influence the gene expression and therefore phenotypes to the environment. How we act and consume now affects our epigenome, and consequently our offspring’s genome. This supports Lamark’s theory, prior to Darwin, who initially proposed the theory of our genes changing with behaviour and experience. [...] A [...] from the University of Auckland warned pregnant women against dieting due to the increased likelihood <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> acquiring eating disorders such as obesity, hence the way we consume food.|$|E

5000|$|Parents may first {{become aware}} of autistic {{symptoms}} <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> {{around the time of}} a routine vaccination.

The latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been [...] "an elaborate fraud". Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations, outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.|$|E

Parenting styles are the representation of how parents respond and demand to their children. Parenting practices are specific behaviors, while {{parenting style}}s represent broader patterns of parenting practices.

5000|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} {{hypothesis}} involving mercury and autism {{involves the use}} of the mercury-based compound thiomersal, a preservative that has been phased out from most childhood vaccinations in developed countries including US and the EU. Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> around the time of a routine vaccination. There is no scientific evidence for a causal connection between thiomersal and autism, but parental concern about the thiomersal controversy has led to decreasing rates of childhood immunizations and increasing likelihood of disease outbreaks. [...] Because of public concerns, thiomersal content was completely removed or dramatically reduced from childhood vaccines that contained it in the 1990s; despite this, autism rates continued to climb well into the late 2000s.|$|E
