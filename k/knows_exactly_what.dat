5|$|When a {{musician}} hears Bix's solo on 'Singing the Blues', he becomes aware after two bars that the soloist <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> {{he is doing}} {{and that he has}} an exquisite sense of discord and resolution. He knows also that this player is endowed with the rarest jazz gift of all, a sense of form which lends to an improvised performance a coherence which no amount of teaching can produce. The listening musician, whatever his generation or his style, recognizes Bix as a modern, modernism being not a style but an attitude.|$|E
25|$|If a {{game has}} an {{information}} set {{with more than}} one member that game is said to have imperfect information. A game with perfect information is such that at any stage of the game, every player <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> has taken place earlier in the game; i.e. every information set is a singleton set. Any game without perfect information has imperfect information.|$|E

25|$|BAE Systems has {{completed}} development of its Striker II Helmet-Mounted Display that {{builds on the}} capabilities of the original Striker Helmet-Mounted Display, which is already in service on the Typhoon. Striker II features a new display with more colour and can transition between day and night seamlessly eliminating the need for separate night vision googles. In addition, the helmet can monitor the pilot’s exact head position so it always <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> information to display. The system is compatible with ANR, a 3-D audio threats system and 3-D communications; these are available as customer options.|$|E
25|$|The play {{is still}} disputed by those involved, {{particularly}} by living personnel from the Raiders and their fans, who insist the Raiders should have won. Tatum {{said that the}} ball did not bounce off him, both immediately after the game as well as later; however, in his memoirs, Tatum equivocated, stating {{that he could not}} honestly say if the ball hit him. Raiders linebacker Phil Villapiano, who was covering Harris at the time, maintains that the ball hit Fuqua. Fuqua has been coy, supposedly saying he <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> happened that day but will never tell.|$|E

500|$|Lydia first {{arriving}} on-screen {{was first}} shown {{as different from}} other characters and it was stated from her inception that she was passionate about music and enjoyed getting people into the music scene. Speaking of her character, Kelly stated [...] "She's very down to earth. She <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> she wants, where she wants to go, {{and how to get}} there! She's also very level-headed." [...] From the characters inception, she was shown to be an opinionated, proud young student who wasn't afraid of her homosexuality and a person who could make friends very easily, as well as enemies.|$|E
500|$|Kristen Cloke, Morgan's wife, {{was cast}} as teacher Valerie Lewton. [...] "I have {{incredible}} respect for them," [...] said Cloke. [...] "Jim's {{the kind of}} director who <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he wants. As an actor, I {{can find a way}} to get there if I know specifically what I'm going for, and Jim gives me that. The fact that he won't move on until he's got exactly what he wants creates a safe environment, which allows me to experiment and try different things". [...] Cloke described her part as [...] "strong and sassy – in control. After the crash she comes unglued, probably more than any of the kids, and it's a quick, drastic change. I had to understand the psychology of a person who can turn on a dime like that".|$|E
500|$|In January 1947 Olivier {{began working}} on his second film as a director, Hamlet (1948), in which he also took the lead role. The {{original}} play was heavily cut {{to focus on the}} relationships, rather than the political intrigue. The film became a critical and commercial success in Britain and abroad, although Lejeune, in The Observer, considered it [...] "less effective than [...] stage work.... He speaks the lines nobly, and with the caress of one who loves them, but he nullifies his own thesis by never, for a moment, leaving the impression of a man who cannot make up his own mind; here, you feel rather, is an actor-producer-director who, in every circumstance, <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he wants, and gets it". Campbell Dixon, the critic for The Daily Telegraph thought the film [...] "brilliant... one of the masterpieces of the stage has been made into one of the greatest of films." [...] Hamlet became the first non-American film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, while Olivier won the Award for Best Actor.|$|E

500|$|In July 2010, Minogue {{released}} her eleventh studio album, Aphrodite. The album featured new songwriters and producers including Stuart Price as executive producer. Price {{also contributed to}} song writing along with Minogue, Calvin Harris, Jake Shears, Nerina Pallot, Pascal Gabriel, Lucas Secon, Keane's Tim Rice-Oxley and Kish Mauve. The album received favourable reviews from most music critics; Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone labelled the album Minogue's [...] "finest work since 1997's underrated Impossible Princess" [...] and Tim Sendra from Allmusic commended Minogue's choice of collaborators and producers, commenting that the album is the [...] "work of someone who <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> her skills are and who to hire to help showcase them to perfection". Aphrodite debuted at number-one in the United Kingdom, exactly twenty two years after her first number one hit in the United Kingdom. The album's lead single, [...] "All the Lovers," [...] was a success and became her thirty-third top ten single in the United Kingdom, though subsequent singles from the album, [...] "Get Outta My Way", [...] "Better than Today", and [...] "Put Your Hands Up", failed {{to reach the top}} ten of the UK Singles Chart. However, all the singles released from the album have topped the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart.|$|E
500|$|When {{the episodes}} aired, Silas was angered by Rae's attitude– {{her desire to}} use men for casual flings– and {{realised}} he could frame Brendan for her murder. He then beat Rae and strangled her to death in an alleyway. [...] Barlow said that because Hollyoaks Later is broadcast late at night, there were no limits to the storyline, allowing the producers to [...] "do whatever they wanted with it." [...] She described Rae's death scene as [...] "absolutely incredible" [...] and loved {{the chance to work}} with accredited actor Rawle. She explained that Rae's death had been kept secret in order to shock viewers in the same way the death of Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) had previously done. Barlow said she was happy and grateful with the nature of her exit storyline, as the opportunity to [...] "go out with a bang" [...] was better than Rae leaving quietly in a taxi. She hoped that Rae's murder would [...] "go down in Hollyoaks history" [...] {{as one of the best}} exits. In the aftermath, Brendan was arrested for Rae's murder after Silas planted evidence on him. Barlow stated that other characters blamed Brendan because he had caused Rae to fear for her life, and that Ste believed he was culpable because [...] "fter all the ups and downs, Ste <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the relationship between Rae and Brendan has been like and all the problems they've had." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of 2013, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters made multiple annual movie lists dedicated to underappreciated or underrated films. Movies.com opined it [...] "is, hands down, the most underappreciated film of the year…'Proper' filmmaking or not, if you've got me cheering at the screening, grinning big and then walking out with a little extra adrenaline, you’ve done something right." [...] Ryan Doom from JoBlo.com wrote that [...] "while usually that’s the thing I mock, [...] somehow ended up pretty damn enjoyable…Why not? It never takes itself serious and it <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> it is: a silly film that isn't afraid {{to do what the}} hell it wants." [...] Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters has hence been labeled as a cult film by a number of horror-fantasy film fans, as well as by some critics who initially saw no merit in the movie. This significant financial and fan following have led some to question the initial perception of the film in relation to its debut in January, considered to be [...] "a refuge for films that don't have a shot of generating good word of mouth or having a leggy run." [...] While Renner's box office draw and the film's [...] "well-articulated premise" [...] have been listed as major factors behind its [...] theatrical success, its ability to maintain a lasting fan following has also been attributed to its original concept, excellent gore and action sequences, Renner's and Arterton's tongue-in-cheek performances, and the film's ability to not take itself too seriously. The film was nominated for the 40th People's Choice Awards in the category Favorite Horror Movie, but lost to Carrie.|$|E

500|$|Garrett's 11-year-old son Richard was an eyewitness. In later years, {{he became}} a Baptist {{minister}} and widely lectured on the events of Booth's demise at his family's farm. In 1921, Garrett's lecture {{was published in the}} Confederate Veteran as the [...] "True Story of the Capture of John Wilkes Booth." [...] According to his account, Booth and Herold arrived at the Garretts' farm, located on the road to Bowling Green, around 3p.m. on Monday afternoon. Confederate mail delivery had ceased {{with the collapse of the}} Confederate government, he explained, so the Garretts were unaware of Lincoln's assassination. After having dinner with the Garretts that evening, Booth learned of the surrender of Johnston's army, the last Confederate armed force of any size. Its capitulation meant that the Civil War was unquestionably over and Booth's attempt had failed to save the Confederacy by Lincoln's assassination. The Garretts also finally learned of Lincoln's death and the substantial reward for Booth's capture. Booth, said Garrett, displayed no reaction other than to ask if the family would turn in the fugitive should they have the opportunity. Still not aware of their guest's true identity, one of the older Garrett sons averred that they might, if only because they needed the money. The next day, Booth told the Garretts that he intended to reach Mexico, drawing a route on a map of theirs. Biographer Theodore Roscoe said of Garrett's account, [...] "Almost nothing written or testified in respect to the doings of the fugitives at Garrett's farm can be taken at face value. Nobody <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> Booth said to the Garretts, or they to him." [...] Garrett was present at the time and was more likely to know the facts than later biographers.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, Aphrodite received an average score of 67 based on 21 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Ben Norman from About.com appreciated Price's production, noting Aphrodite {{to be more}} consistent than X. Although the critic mentioned that the songs do not provide the [...] "immediate appeal", like those in X did, he labelled Aphrodite [...] "another knockout hit album" [...] from Minogue and the [...] "Do Not Miss album of 2010". Tim Sendra from AllMusic commended Minogue's choice of collaborators and producers, commenting that the album is the [...] "work of someone who <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> her skills are and who to hire to help showcase them to perfection". He also appreciated the album's cohesion and commercial prospect, and named it [...] "one of her best". The Billboard review of the album complimented Price's [...] "ability to create consistent sound without sacrificing each track's individuality", and termed Aphrodite a [...] "journey cohesive, fun and fitting for a goddess". Ian Wade from BBC Music gave the album an extremely positive review and {{found it to be}} an [...] "astonishing return to form" [...] for Minogue. Wade commended her for returning to her roots and becoming the [...] "Kylie of Fever and Light Years"; he concluded the review by calling Aphrodite an [...] "all-killer, flags-aloft amazing triumph" [...] and that [...] "not liking this (album) would be like not being keen on breathing". Nick Levine from Digital Spy felt that it was her best album since Fever and admitted that while Aphrodite isn't [...] "deep", it [...] "sure ain't dumb either", opining that it is meant to be heard for relaxation and enjoyment. Mikael Wood praised the tracks' danceability and concluded that [...] "The diminutive Australian diva is still delivering disco thunder from Down Under". Priya Elan from NME felt that Price was the [...] "perfect choice of musical partner" [...] and complimented him for producing Minogue's [...] "most unified work in ages". Christel Loar from PopMatters found the album similar to Light Years and Fever and commended the production, opining that while [...] "dance pop with this much gloss and unabashed glee is relegated to the realms of guilty pleasure", Aphrodite is [...] "that rare representation of perfect production that is just pleasure, pure and simple". Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone labelled the album Minogue's [...] "finest work since 1997's underrated Impossible Princess". Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph complimented Price for enlisting a [...] "top notch" [...] team of collaborators and termed Aphrodite a [...] "mainstream pop blast". Barry Walters from Spin commended Minogue for returning to her original style of music, saying [...] "Finally even the suits realize that no one wants ersatz hip-hop or Americanized AOR from Australia's ultimate pop tart".|$|E
2500|$|Two of Clio's sisters, Melpomene (the oldest sister) and Calliope, are jealous that Clio ({{although}} the youngest) is {{the leader}} of the Muses and that Zeus had promised [...] "Xanadu" [...] to Clio, although no one <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> that entails ("Evil Woman").
