25|$|When {{visual cues}} in an {{environment}} such as visibility of a line where the wall meets the <b>floor,</b> <b>height</b> of the wall, and width of the wall are available to the rat to discern distance and location of the wall, the rat internalizes this external information to register its surroundings. However, when these visual cues are unavailable, the rat registers wall location by colliding with the wall and then place cell firing rate after the collision provides information to the rat about its distance from the wall based on the direction and speed of its movements after the collision. In this situation, the firing of place cells is due to motor inputs.|$|E
25|$|The Miu Fat Buddhist Monastery {{was first}} {{constructed}} in 1950. Over {{the following two}} decades came {{the construction of the}} 3-storey Ten Thousand Buddhas Hall at a cost of $60 million. It took six years to complete, with its consecration ceremony held in May 1980. The Mahavira Hall, located on the top storey, has a <b>floor</b> <b>height</b> of about 20 metres. In the middle of the Hall, there are three gold-plated statues of the Buddha Sakyamuni, each of them is about 5-metre tall. Its interior walls are adorned with over 10 thousands of Buddha reliefs and a number of murals featuring a blend of Sino-Thai cultures, which are so magnificent and eye-catching. Higher up in the Hall are the Library of Buddhist Scriptures and the Attic of the Jade Buddha. On each side of the main entrance of the Hall is a 20-metre column carved with a dazzling lifelike giant gold-scaled dragon, making the building prominently imposing. The Monastery also has a kitchen serving mouthwatering vegetarian food for visitors.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are four}} {{important}} height measurements above the railhead: platform height, traditional <b>floor</b> <b>height,</b> downstairs <b>floor</b> <b>height</b> and upstairs <b>floor</b> <b>height.</b> Platform height determines the level entry height for wheeled objects, such as luggage, strollers, wheelchairs and bicycles. Platform height is ideally standardized across all stations the train serves. Traditional rail car <b>floor</b> <b>height</b> matters for end doors connecting to existing single floor rail cars. Downstairs or lowest <b>floor</b> <b>height</b> is primarily {{determined by the}} thickness of the beams connecting the span between the wheels and bogies (trucks) of a rail car. The upstairs floor or highest <b>floor</b> <b>height</b> is above the lowest floor and must fit under bridges and tunnels. Level entry <b>floor</b> <b>height</b> must match the platform height. Hopefully either the traditional or downstairs <b>floor</b> <b>height</b> already matches the platform height.

50|$|The {{design of}} the Mink Building was {{extremely}} practical; from the <b>floor</b> <b>heights,</b> which were strictly necessary, to the façade, which achieves the purpose of advertising for the company. The exterior decoration was typical of German-American architecture of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. In fact, {{it is possible to}} find buildings in Manhattan that may have influenced Oberlein’s work. The Free Library and Reading Hall and German Dispensary, designed by William Schickel in the 1880s, probably drew Oberlein’s attention. Schickel used patterned brick-work as economical ornamentation, especially to highlight windows and cornices and mark <b>floor</b> <b>heights,</b> and Oberlein included this kind of decoration as a way to make the Bernheimer & Schwartz building easily identifiable to potential customers, business partners, and workers, as well as to German-Americans in general.|$|R
2500|$|Depending on {{train station}} {{platform}} heights, three designs {{can be used}} for entry - high platforms require use of a [...] "split level" [...] car design, where the doors are located on a middle level, with access into the upper or lower level branching off - with stairs or ramps going both up and down (sometimes this configuration includes a section of seating at the middle level in the entry section, with double levels only in part of the lengths of the car). For low train station platforms, a [...] "two floor" [...] design with level entry onto the lower floor is used. Occasionally a third, very tall [...] "two floors over-wheel" [...] design is used. This is a traditional single floor car [...] "with a second story" [...] design with, when using low platform, requires steps up to a traditional <b>floor</b> <b>height</b> and then internal stairs up to the upper floor.|$|E

2500|$|A {{test system}} in Toronto {{was the primary}} concern. With the GO-Urban concept having since been cancelled, and GO Transit having turned to {{conventional}} heavy rail systems, the only suitable local market was the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The TTC had recently extended the east-west Bloor-Danforth subway line {{with the addition of}} another station on each end of the line, and had planned to further extend the line with streetcars running from those stations into the suburbs. Construction had already started on the streetcar system at the eastern end of the line at Kennedy station when the provincial government asked them to switch to the ICTS. The TTC was uninterested until the government threatened to pull their financing, which accounted for 75% of the capital budget. In exchange, the government agreed to pay for any cost overruns above the original streetcar budget. Construction of the internal streetcar platform and a turn-around loop had already been completed at the station. The platform had to be raised to the higher <b>floor</b> <b>height</b> of the ICTS, but UTDC claimed the vehicle would be able to make its way around the [...] radius loop at [...] without additional modification.|$|E

These construction projects were very complicated, since the <b>floor</b> <b>heights</b> of Löwenstein and Römer were radically different.|$|R

2500|$|Expanding student numbers {{meant that}} more {{extensive}} premises {{closer to the}} city were required. A bequest by John Jones of land at Stanmore saw the College move to the newly fashionable inner-city suburbs. A grand stone edifice was designed by Thomas Rowe and {{has been described by}} architectural historian Morton Herman as 'an almost perfect example of scholastic Gothic Revival architecture'. Earth-moving work began on the site in 1876 and by May 1878 the building had reached first <b>floor</b> <b>height.</b> A public ceremony was held and six commemorative stones were laid.

He had lent £12,000 for the new buildings at Stanmore and later endowed the Wigram Allen Scholarship for boys proceeding to matriculation. The formal opening of the new school building was by Sir George on 18 January 1881. By resolution of the College Council, the name Newington College was perpetuated on the new site. Seventy school and theological students migrated from Silverwater to Stanmore and Newington has remained there ever since.|$|E

A great semicircular window commanded a wonderful view of the park, but Wrayson had little time to admire it.

50|$|The {{height of}} {{platforms}} is also a consideration when considering the loading gauge of passenger trains.
