Sunday Tribune journalist Una Mullally called it [...] "one of the most original and progressive Irish albums ever made". Aaagh! reached number two in the Irish Albums Chart, going platinum in the process, received regular airplay on Irish radio and produced five singles, including [...] "The Idiots", a song about Mick Pyro's former girlfriend which also features her on vocals. [...] "Break", a top ten single in Ireland and top forty single in South Africa, was temporarily banned by South African radio station 5fm when a female DJ declared on air that it promoted anal sex without contraception, a comment which led to several complaints from listeners.

Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley, the future co-founder of the National Trust was undecided : he was a strong advocate of the Lake District's ability to provide recreation, rest and fresh-air, as well as aesthetic pleasure, but also knew <b>just</b> <b>how</b> the <b>big</b> cities of the North needed pure water to prevent disease. The scheme was passed in Parliament in 1879.

500|$|Of the reviewers, Time rated it an A-minus and added, [...] "Burton and Depp infuse the {{brilliant}} cold steel of Stephen Sondheim's score with a burning passion. Helena Bonham Carter and a superb supporting cast bring focused fury to this musical nightmare. It's bloody great." [...] Times Richard Corliss named the film {{one of its}} top ten movies of 2007, placing it fifth. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it four stars out of four, lauding Burton's visual style. In his review in Variety, Todd McCarthy called it [...] "both sharp and fleet" [...] and [...] "a satisfying screen version of Stephen Sondheim's landmark 1979 theatrical musical ... things have turned out uniformly right thanks to highly focused direction by Tim Burton, expert screw-tightening by scenarist John Logan, and haunted and musically adept lead performances from Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. Assembled artistic combo assures the film will reap {{by far the biggest}} audience to see a pure Sondheim musical, although <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>big</b> depends on the upscale crowd’s tolerance for buckets of blood, {{and the degree to which}} the masses stay away due to the whiff of the highbrow." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B-plus in its Movie Reviews section and stated, [...] "To stage a proper Sweeney Todd, necks must be slit, human flesh must be squished into pastries, and blood ought to spurt in fountains and rivers of death. Enter Tim Burton, who... has tenderly art-directed soup-thick, tomato-red, fake-gore blood with the zest of a Hollywood-funded Jackson Pollock." [...] She went on to refer to the piece as [...] "opulent, attentive... so finely minced a mixture of Sondheim's original melodrama and Burton's signature spicing that it's difficult to think of any other filmmaker so naturally suited for the job." ...|$|E

Richard Alf, chairman in 1971, has noted an early factor in the Con's growth was an effort [...] "to expand the Comic-Con organizing committee base by networking with other fandoms such as the Society for Creative Anachronism and the Mythopoeic Society, among others. (We found a lot of talent and strength through diversity)." [...] By the late 1970s, the show had grown {{to such an extent that}} Bob Schreck recalled visiting with his then-boss Gary Berman of Creation Conventions and reflecting, [...] "While Berman kept repeating (attempting to convince himself) 'This show's not any bigger than ours!'

40|$|Plug and Abandonment (P&A) {{has become}} a major focus in the {{petroleum}} industry and especially in Norway due to the maturity of the fields. Therefore, an extensive number of wells to be abandoned <b>just</b> show <b>how</b> <b>big</b> the challenge will be and how much focus the regulatory authorities should include into this issue. From an operational point of view, P&A is the last phase of the life cycle of a well and hence no return of capital from it is actually expected. Furthermore, the driver for operators relies under a strict regulatory framework and the responsibility for the abandoned well long after the wellbore has been plugged and the surface equipment removed. Under such uneconomical conditions, this thesis intends to investigate new technology trends that provide an effective P&A operation. Therefore, first the regulatory framework is deeply studied for better understanding of the Norwegian structure and requirements for P&A. An example case of a Conventional Platform P&A is provided with the intention of identifying the operational procedure and conventional tools. Finally, the new technology trends are introduced, analyzed and compared from a technical/operational point of view. By understanding the similarities, key features, limitations and differences between the new technology and criteria it is possible to create an analysis case for the same well presented in the example case. This analysis intends to find the maximum and minimum operational steps that can result by using these new technologies thereafter validating their benefit over a conventional P&A operation...|$|R

40|$|Classically the {{immunological}} ‘Big Bang’ {{of adaptive}} immunity {{was believed to}} have resulted from the insertion of a transposon into an immunoglobulin superfamily gene member, initiating antigen receptor gene rearrangement via the RAG recombinase in an ancestor of jawed vertebrates. However, {{the discovery of a}} second, convergent adaptive immune system in jawless fish, focused on the so-called variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs), was arguably the most exciting finding of the past decade in immunology and has drastically changed the view of immune origins. The recent report of a new lymphocyte lineage in lampreys, defined by the antigen receptor VLRC, suggests that there were three lymphocyte lineages in the common ancestor of jawless and jawed vertebrates that co-opted different antigen receptor supertypes. The transcriptional control of these lineages during development is predicted to be remarkably similar in both the jawless (agnathan) and jawed (gnathostome) vertebrates, suggesting that an early ‘division of labor’ among lymphocytes was a driving force in the emergence of adaptive immunity. The recent cartilaginous fish genome project suggests that most effector cytokines and chemokines were also present in these fish, and further studies of the lamprey and hagfish genomes will determine <b>just</b> <b>how</b> explosive the <b>Big</b> Bang actually was...|$|R
