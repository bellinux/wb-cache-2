500|$|The ending was {{altered by}} the writers; the protagonist chooses a {{completely}} different girl in the film {{than the one he}} selects in the novel. Rye was concerned about the reactions of viewers who had read the novel, and it took Gowariker a while to convince him to agree. The writers were highly impressed and relieved by the characters' fine detailing in the novel, adding: [...] "The written matter was very strong and we had to <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> few layers on that." [...] While writing the screenplay, Mehta and Gowariker decided to have one song for each zodiac sign to bring out the personality of each sign and its related girl. They had to write each character with different nuances. The title of the film is taken from a fictional book, What's Your Raashee?, about the compatibility between the sun signs, which the protagonist reads in the film.|$|E
500|$|The Simpson family host a tastemaker {{party at}} their home to promote Absolut Krusty, Krusty the Clown's own brand of vodka. Mr. Burns takes notice of the party's success and decides to promote Homer to [...] "Account Man" [...] for the Springfield Nuclear Plant. Robert Marlow, a {{seasoned}} account veteran, takes Homer under his wing and shows Homer what the high life is like in the corner office.

When Homer's long hours at the office become the norm and Homer becomes distant from his family, a family vacation with Marge and the children help him realize that family always comes before work. Meanwhile, Lisa introduces Bart to a new literary world which sparks his interest in reading classic novels.

When the bullies watches him reading a classic novel at school, they force him to read Little Women to them.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Sargent (a {{close friend}} and {{photographer}} of the band) described their relationship as like [...] "first love, and all the jealousy and obsessiveness that comes with that" [...] - adding [...] "I think there's, y'know, obsession and jealousy on both of their sides. They bitch about each other to each other or to other people. They have a bond, intellectually and spiritually, like nothing I've ever seen ... but sometimes, you know, you just think, God, why don't you <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> room?!" [...] In the same interview, a Radio One documentary, upon being asked just how close their relationship was, Doherty responded [...] "I love him. Wouldn't go, um - certainly not on Radio 1 - go into too much detail, but... we had lots of wonderful times together, yeah." [...] Barât, when questioned similarly, steadfastly denied that the relationship had involved anything [...] "physical". Barât has insisted that [...] "people are really into conjecture" [...] and has frequently denied having {{a sexual relationship with}} Doherty. However, in a 2011 interview when asked if the two had ever had a physical relationship he replied [...] "There have been moments in our relationship where physicality has ensued." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two {{additional}} shortened versions {{were also}} used occasionally when episodes ran over the allotted time: the version used in a few episodes of season two cut half of the first stanza and the entire second, going directly to the first chorus following the verse, [...] "Sometimes you <b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> feeling/Like you {{need some kind of}} change...", reducing the length to 65 seconds, but the version used from season three onward used all but the second stanza, reducing the length to 48 seconds; the season four short version added a shorter harmonica portion near the end, which was absent in the season three short version. It has been a common misconception that the theme was reduced to the 48-second version from season three onward but that version was only used in syndicated reruns to allow stations added commercial time. The 72-second version was used for all episodes originally broadcast on ABC from seasons 3 to 8, with exceptions where ABC airings used the 48-second version when episodes ran over the allotted time. A shorter instrumental version of the theme, also composed by Frederick and Salvay, was also used as a closing theme in all but a few episodes (and was dropped entirely for season eight), which was rearranged in season three to sound nearly identical to the main theme, with another rearrangement for season five that saw it elongated from 30 seconds to 40 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|Enrique Morente Cotelo (25 December 1942 – 13 December 2010), {{known as}} Enrique Morente, was a flamenco singer and a {{controversial}} figure {{within the world}} of contemporary flamenco. After his orthodox beginnings, he plunged into experimentalism, writing new melodies for cante (flamenco singing) and jamming with musicians of all styles, without renouncing his roots in traditional flamenco singing, which he kept on cultivating. In spite of severe criticism from the most [...] "purist" [...] amongst the critics and public, [...] "It hasn't been easy. First came the accusations of corruption of the music, of treachery in his struggle to disfigure what was already perfectly coded. When some albums and some categorical evidence of {{his knowledge of the}} classical approach laid these malicious comments bare, then came the most twisted condemnations. That the pace of the compás waned (<b>just</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> metronome and see for yourself), that he didn't really make you feel (are there really many true aficionados whose hair doesn't stand on end listening to his caña ‘Eso no lo manda la ley’, ‘La aurora de Nueva York’ or ‘Generalife’, to name three markedly different examples) and that kind of thing." [...] he was perhaps the most influential contemporary flamenco singer, who not only innovated, but it could also be said that he created tradition: some of his cantes have been performed by other singers such as Camarón de la Isla, Mayte Martín, Carmen Linares, Miguel Poveda, Segundo Falcón and Arcángel. He also is the father of flamenco singer Estrella Morente.|$|E
