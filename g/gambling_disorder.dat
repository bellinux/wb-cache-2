This research explores whether excessive trading can be conceptualized as a subset of <b>gambling</b> <b>disorders.</b> ObjectiveTo better acknowledge the existence of an addictive-like trading behavior and to discuss its phenomenological similarities with <b>gambling</b> <b>disorders.</b> MethodsThe data of 8 excessive traders out of a cohort of 221 outpatients seeking treatment in our Problem Gambling unit were analyzed. ResultsOur case series revealed important similarities with <b>gambling</b> <b>disorders</b> in terms of diagnosis, trajectory and comorbidities. Like many disordered gamblers, excessive traders of this study experienced a number of small early wins, chased their losses, and ended up losing control over the money they invested. All of them invested in very risky stocks associated with short-term trading leading to potential large gains, but also with very significant losses. The structure itself of the two activities (gambling and trading) is very close. ConclusionOur results tended to support the idea of an addictive-like trading behavior as a subset of <b>gambling</b> <b>disorders.</b> Investing is not a form of gambling, but some people gamble with investments. Several observations and recommendations can be made: (i) conduct researches; (ii) build and validate specific assessment tools; (iii) develop strategies for prevention and treatment; and (iv) conduct more rigorous studies to clarify what we named an addictive-like trading behavior...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the review}} is to present the {{complexity}} of issues related to treatment of <b>gambling</b> <b>disorders,</b> including definition of gambling and diagnostic criteria, the coexistence of <b>gambling</b> <b>disorders</b> and other disorders, epidemiology of the phenomenon, the prevalence of help seeking, the therapeutic offer for gamblers and its effectiveness, motivations and barriers to treatment. Material and method: The {{review of the literature}} was conducted using the MEDLINE database and Google Scholar. Two general search terms: “gambling” and “treatment” were used, and exploration was limited to 2000 – 2014. A total number of 96 publications were included in the review. Results: The legalisation of gambling contributed to a growth in the social acceptance for this type of behaviour. <b>Gambling</b> <b>disorders</b> are often associated with mental disorders (mood, neurotic and personality disorders), and psychoactive substance dependence. The vast majority of gamblers do not seek treatment and about one third of them recover without professional help. Among those who decided on treatment, participation in the Gamblers Anonymous meetings is the most preferred form. Cognitive behavioural therapy, brief interventions and controlled gambling are effective forms of treatment as confirmed by evaluation studies. Gamblers decide to take treatment mainly for economic reasons or because of concerns about their mental and physical health. Barriers to treatment are primarily gamblers’ beliefs that they can solve their problems themselves, shame, fear of stigma, lack of information on what the treatment is and doubts about its effectiveness and quality...|$|R

40|$|<b>Gambling</b> <b>disorder</b> sufferers prefer {{immediately}} larger rewards despite {{long term}} losses on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), and these impairments {{are associated with}} dopamine dysfunctions. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter linked with temporal and structural dysfunctions in substance use disorder, which has supported the idea of impaired decision-making and dopamine dysfunctions in <b>gambling</b> <b>disorder.</b> However, evidence from substance use disorders cannot be directly transferred to <b>gambling</b> <b>disorder.</b> This article focuses on three hypotheses of dopamine dysfunctions in <b>gambling</b> <b>disorder,</b> which appear to be fallacies, i. e., have not been supported {{in a series of}} positron emission tomography (PET) studies. The first fallacy suggests that <b>gambling</b> <b>disorder</b> suffers, similar to substance use disorders, have lower dopamine receptor availability. No evidence supported this hypothesis. The second fallacy suggests that maladaptive decision-making in <b>gambling</b> <b>disorder</b> is associated with higher dopamine release during gambling. No evidence supported the hypothesis, and the literature on substance use disorders offers limited support for this hypothesis. The third fallacy suggests that maladaptive decision-making in <b>gambling</b> <b>disorder</b> is associated with higher dopamine release during winning. The evidence did not support this hypothesis either. Instead, dopaminergic coding of reward prediction and uncertainty might better account for dopamine dysfunctions in <b>gambling</b> <b>disorder.</b> Studies of reward prediction and reward uncertainty shows a sustained dopamine response towards stimuli with maximum uncertainty, which may explain the continued dopamine release and gambling despite losses in <b>gambling</b> <b>disorder.</b> The findings from the studies presented here are consistent with the notion of dopaminergic dysfunctions of reward prediction and reward uncertainty signals in <b>gambling</b> <b>disorder...</b>|$|E
30|$|In contrast, {{gambling}} {{is seen as}} an acceptable leisure activity in the Western world and the Asian countries (Binde 2005; Ohtsuka 2013; Ohtsuka and Ohtsuka 2010). Gambling fulfills entertainment needs of families or within peer groups. For example, with male friend groups seeking thrills and excitement through engagement in gambling entertainment or financial gains in sports betting (Nekich and Ohtsuka 2016); while a group of female friends may seek casual social outings to glamorous gaming venues like casinos (Ohtsuka 2013) or local pubs (Nekich and Ohtsuka 2016). A wide exposure and acceptance of gambling as a leisure activity and permissible attitudes towards gambling may be risk factors for increased cases of <b>gambling</b> <b>disorders,</b> however a permissive attitude may facilitate help-seeking behaviour as the extent of the stigma attached to <b>gambling</b> (or <b>gambling</b> <b>disorders)</b> is somewhat modest.

40|$|Pathological {{and problem}} {{gambling}} {{refer to a}} class of disorders, including those meeting criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis, and others comprising a spectrum of severity defined by significant personal and social harm, that may be common in substance use treatment but are frequently unrecognised. This paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of available evidence indicating the prevalence of such <b>gambling</b> <b>disorders</b> in substance use treatment. It provides the best available estimates from studies of clinical samples of substance users, and suggests around 14 % of patients that demonstrate comorbid pathological gambling. Around 23 % suffer conditions along the broader spectrum of problem gambling. The review also highlights important limitations of existing evidence, including scant data on current versus lifetime comorbidity, as well as reliance on convenience samples and self-administered measures of gambling problems. Notwithstanding a concomitant need for caution when applying these results, the findings suggest a strong need to identify and manage gambling comorbidity in substance use treatment.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{developed}} prevalence {{estimates of}} gambling-related disorders in the United States and Canada, identified differences in prevalence among population segments, and identified changes in prevalence {{over the past}} 20 years. METHODS: A meta-analytic strategy was employed to synthesize estimates from 119 prevalence studies. This method produced more reliable prevalence rates than were available from any single study.

40|$|Background. Effective {{psychological}} treatment, including cognitive behavioral {{therapy and}} motivational interviewing (MI), {{is available for}} people with problematic gambling behaviors. To advance the development of treatment for <b>gambling</b> <b>disorder,</b> {{it is critical to}} further investigate how comorbidity impacts different types of treatments. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether screening for risky alcohol habits can provide guidance on whether people with <b>gambling</b> <b>disorder</b> should be recommended cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT) or MI. Methods. The present study is a secondary analysis of a previous randomized controlled trial that compared the effects of CBGT, MI and a waitlist control group in the treatment of disordered gambling. Assessment and treatment was conducted at an outpatient dependency clinic in Stockholm, Sweden, where 53 trial participants with <b>gambling</b> <b>disorder</b> began treatment. A modified version of the National Opinion Research Centre DSM-IV Screen for gambling problems was used to assess <b>gambling</b> <b>disorder.</b> The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was used to screen for risky alcohol habits. Results. The interaction between treatment and alcohol habits was significant and suggests that patients with <b>gambling</b> <b>disorder</b> and risky alcohol habits were better helped by MI, while those without risky alcohol habits were better helped by CBGT. Conclusions. The results support a screening procedure including the AUDIT prior to starting treatment for <b>gambling</b> <b>disorder</b> because the result of the screening can provide guidance in the choice of treatment. Patients with <b>gambling</b> <b>disorder</b> and risky alcohol habits are likely to be best helped if they are referred to MI, while those without risky alcohol habits are likely to be best helped if they are referred to CBGT...|$|E
