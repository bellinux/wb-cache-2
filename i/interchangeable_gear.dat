This gearbox has <b>interchangeable</b> <b>gear</b> ratios {{and is more}} durable making it more suitable for racing than the standard 911 type 996 gearbox.|$|E

50|$|Rybczynski {{discovered}} that the screwdriver {{is a relatively new}} addition to the toolbox, an invention of the Late Middle Ages in Europe and the only major mechanical device not independently invented by the Chinese. Leonardo da Vinci was there at the start, designing a number of screw-cutting machines with <b>interchangeable</b> <b>gears.</b> Nevertheless, it took generations for the screw (and with it, the screwdriver and lathe) to come into general use, and it was not until modern times that improvements such as slotted screws came into being. Rybczynski spends some time discussing the underrated Canadian invention, the Robertson screwdriver.|$|R

Although deemed satisfactory, the planning group considered other U.S. Air Service military aircraft both in service and production, with a view that a dedicated design that could be fitted with <b>interchangeable</b> landing <b>gear,</b> wheeled and pontoons for water landings, would be preferable.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} the performance of a single track de-vice driving on dry, granular soils. A single-track test rig is used to empirically in-vestigate track motion under controlled track slip and loading conditions on three natural dry granular materials:a dry sandy material with 100 um average grain size, a dry sandy material with 400 um average grain size, and a coarse gravel with 1 cm average particle size. Test conditions can be designed to replicate typ-ical field scenarios for lightweight robots, while key operational parameters such as drawbar force, torque, and sinkage are measured. This test rig enables imposi-tion of velocities, or application of loads, to <b>interchangeable</b> running <b>gears</b> within a confined soil bin of dimensions 1. 5 m long, 0. 7 m wide, and 0. 4 m deep. The tested single track device has an effective contact area measuring approximatel...|$|R
50|$|A rack is a toothed bar or rod {{that can}} be thought of as a sector gear with an {{infinitely}} large radius of curvature. Torque can be converted to linear force by meshing a rack with a pinion: the pinion turns; the rack moves in a straight line. Such a mechanism is used in automobiles to convert the rotation of the steering wheel into the left-to-right motion of the tie rod(s). Racks also feature in the theory of gear geometry, where, for instance, the tooth shape of an <b>interchangeable</b> set of <b>gears</b> may be specified for the rack, (infinite radius), and the tooth shapes for gears of particular actual radii are then derived from that. The rack and pinion gear type is employed in a rack railway.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} novel {{experimental methods}} aimed at understanding the fundamental phenomena governing {{the motion of}} lightweight vehicles on dry, granular soils. A single-wheel test rig is used to empirically investigate wheel motion under controlled wheel slip and loading conditions on sandy, dry soil. Test conditions can be designed to replicate typical field scenarios for lightweight robots, while key operational parameters such as drawbar force, torque, and sinkage are measured. This test rig enables imposition of velocities, or application of loads, to <b>interchangeable</b> running <b>gears</b> within a confined soil bin of dimensions 1. 5 m long, 0. 7 m wide, and 0. 4 m deep. This allows testing of small-scale wheels, tracks, and cone or plate penetrators. Aside from standard wheel experiments (i. e., measurements of drawbar force, applied torque, and sinkage during controlled slip runs) two additional experimental methodologies have been developed. The first relies on high-speed imaging of the wheel-soil interface {{and the use of}} particle image velocimetry (PIV) to measure micro-scale terrain kinematics. The second experimental methodology consists of a custom force sensor array located at the wheel-terrain interface. The sensors allow explicit measurement of normal and shear forces (and, therefore, estimation of normal and shear stresses) at numerous discrete points along the wheel-soil interface. Experimental measurements gathered by these test methodologies are to be compared against well-established semi-empirical models, to validate and understand limitations of the models and propose improvements...|$|R
50|$|As well {{as modern}} {{passenger}} train locomotives, the DR in East Germany needed more goods train locomotives with a 15 t axle load. As a result, a parallel development, {{like those of}} the pre-war time, was initiated for a passenger train engine, the DR Class 23.10, and a goods train engine, the DR Class 50.40, in order that many of their components could be <b>interchangeable.</b> The running <b>gear</b> conformed broadly to that of the Einheitslok, but a plate frame had to be used, because bar frames could no longer be worked. The boiler was a new build to modern construction standards with a combustion chamber and a mixer preheater. In terms of performance it was roughly comparable to the standard boiler, but was somewhat more economic in its fuel consumption. The locomotives were also given new tenders, the 2'2' T 28. The 88 engines, which were renumbered from 50 4001 to 50 4088, were delivered between 1956 and 1960. Number 50 4088 was therefore the last standard gauge steam engine to be newly built in Germany. They were permanently stationed on the routes over the plains in the northern railway divisions. Because the plate frame soon proved to be the weakest link (with a high repair bill), the locos were taken out of traction service by 1980, but continued to be used as heating engines.|$|R
