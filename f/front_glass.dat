Each {{variation of the}} device is available with either a black or white <b>front</b> <b>glass</b> panel.

5|$|In the US and Canada, nine {{variations}} of the third-generation iPad were offered, compared to six {{in the rest of}} the world, although some countries had only the Wi-Fi only model. Each variation was available with black or white <b>front</b> <b>glass</b> panels, with options for 16, 32, or 64GB of storage. In North America, connectivity options were Wi-Fi only, Wi-Fi + 4G (LTE) on Verizon, AT, Telus, Rogers, or Bell. For the rest of the world outside North America, connectivity options are Wi-Fi only (on the Wi-Fi model) or Wi-Fi + 3G (on the Wi-Fi + Cellular model), with the latter unavailable in some countries, as 4G (LTE) connectivity for the device is not available outside North America. The Wi-Fi + Cellular model includes GPS capability.|$|E

25|$|CRTs with an unphosphored <b>front</b> <b>glass</b> {{but with}} fine wires {{embedded}} in it {{were used as}} electrostatic print heads in the 1960s. The wires would pass the electron beam current through the glass onto {{a sheet of paper}} where the desired content was therefore deposited as an electrical charge pattern. The paper was then passed near a pool of liquid ink with the opposite charge. The charged areas of the paper attract the ink and thus form the image.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} C9 prototype was a modern-styled saloon {{with a low}} beltline {{and large}} interior dimensions {{made possible by the}} long-wheelbase. The British design team initially proposed some stylistic features inspired by the Citroën SM, including a <b>front</b> <b>glass</b> panel between the headlights to accommodate the number plate, round front wheelarches and rear spats. However, Chrysler management in the United States deemed these features too extravagant, so the design of the C9 became more conventional: front and rear wheelarches were squared off and the spats lost, and the license plate was placed on the front bumper as on most cars. To better balance the tall silhouette, the beltline was raised. Over the course of development, the C9 also lost its vertical taillights in favour of more [...] "fashionable" [...] horizontal ones.|$|E

2500|$|The AA was a fully {{enclosed}} 4-door sedan that largely copied {{the design of}} the Chrysler built DeSoto Airflow. [...] It had a metal body on a metal ladder chassis. The metal body was of modern construction compared to the fabric-over-wooden-frame bodies used on cars designed in the 1920s. The rear doors opened backwards as suicide doors. The <b>front</b> <b>glass</b> spanned the entire width of the body in a single pane.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Warren Commission, {{a second}} shot that struck the President was {{recorded}} at Zapruder film frame 313. The Commission made no conclusion {{as to whether}} {{this was the second}} or third bullet fired. The presidential limousine then passed in front of the John Neely Bryan north pergola concrete structure. The two investigative committees concluded that the second shot to hit the president entered the rear of his head (the House Select Committee placed the entry wound four inches higher than the Warren Commission placed it) and passed in fragments through his skull; this created a large, [...] "roughly ovular" [...] hole on the rear, right side. The president's blood and fragments of his scalp, brain, and skull landed on the interior of the car, the inner and outer surfaces of the <b>front</b> <b>glass</b> windshield and raised sun visors, {{as well as on the}} front engine hood and the rear trunk lid. His blood and fragments also landed on the follow-up Secret Service car and its driver's left arm, as well on the motorcycle officers who were riding on both sides of the President just behind his vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1912, {{the vast}} number of imitators {{prompted}} Houdini to replace his milk can act with the Chinese water torture cell. In this escape, Houdini's feet were locked in stocks, and he was lowered upside down into a tank filled with water. The mahogany and metal cell featured a glass front, through which audiences could clearly see Houdini. The stocks were locked {{to the top of}} the cell, and a curtain concealed his escape. In the earliest version of the torture cell, a metal cage was lowered into the cell, and Houdini was enclosed inside that. While making the escape more difficult – the cage prevented Houdini from turning – the cage bars also offered protection should the <b>front</b> <b>glass</b> break. The original cell was built in England, where Houdini first performed the escape for an audience of one person as part of a one-act play he called [...] "Houdini Upside Down". This was so he could copyright the effect and have grounds to sue imitators, which he did. While the escape was advertised as [...] "The Chinese Water Torture Cell" [...] or [...] "The Water Torture Cell", Houdini always referred to it as [...] "the Upside Down" [...] or [...] "USD". The first public performance of the USD was at the Circus Busch in Berlin, on September 21, 1912. Houdini continued to perform the escape until his death in 1926.|$|E
