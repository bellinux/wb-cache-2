25|$|After the {{introduction}} of iOS 7 in June 2013, Apple began using an extra-thin weight of Helvetica Neue for the user interface of iOS 7, arousing numerous complaints about the less legible typography. For the final release of the operating system, Apple changed the system's font to a slightly thicker weight of Helvetica Neue, although some have complained that readability is still compromised compared to the <b>font</b> <b>weight</b> used in former versions of iOS. Older iOS devices continue to use Helvetica or Helvetica Neue in regular font weights that display with higher contrast on low-resolution displays.|$|E

50|$|Optima nova is a {{redesign}} {{of the original}} font family, designed by Hermann Zapf and Linotype GmbH type director Akira Kobayashi. The new family contains 7 <b>font</b> <b>weights,</b> adding light, demi, and heavy <b>font</b> <b>weights,</b> but removing extra black weight. Medium weight is readjusted to between medium and bold weights in the old family scale. Glyph sets are expanded to include Adobe CE and Latin Extended characters, with light to bold <b>weight</b> <b>fonts</b> supporting proportional lining figures, old style figures, and small caps.|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of over 600 characters, and is metric-compatible with Gill Sans. The {{family has been}} includes <b>font</b> <b>weights</b> with complementary italics.|$|R
50|$|GenEi Antique (源暎アンチック): Based on Source Han Sans JP, Gen Shin Gothic, Linux Biolinum, GL-Antique. Only 1 <b>font</b> <b>weight</b> is available. Font format {{was changed}} to TrueType outline in version 3.0.|$|E

50|$|In 2010, The Gris {{subfamily}} {{was added}} to Parisine PRO family, which includes 2 intermediate <b>font</b> <b>weights</b> between Parisine PRO Clair and Parisine PRO.|$|R
50|$|The Noto {{version of}} the font {{families}} include <b>font</b> <b>weights</b> in Thin 250, Light 300, DemiLight 350, Regular 400, Medium 500, Bold 700, Black 900.|$|R
5000|$|Sized between 11 and 13 points (96 dpi), glyphs have {{inconsistent}} stroke weight {{without the}} activation of ClearType. Sometimes, {{especially on the}} Mac OS X and Linux platforms, these problems can sometimes be avoided by displaying fonts in semi-bold or bold as their normal (lightest) <b>font</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|E
50|$|GenEi Gothic (源暎ゴシック): Changes include {{altering}} <b>font</b> <b>weight</b> names (Normal, Regular, Medium {{are changed}} to SemiLight, Regular, SemiBold respectively), redesigned glyphs for 'き', 'こ', 'さ', 'と', 'ま', '人', '1', '?'; half-width Latin glyphs are readjusted to Japanese glyph heights, maintaining same horizontal glyph margins for base kana subglyphs in kana glyphs containing voiced or semi-voiced mark, using full-width space as basis to readjust glyph cell widths for Latin glyphs.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to extra font width and weight combinations, the fonts are digitally interpolated, so that character widths scale uniformly with changing font weights. For fonts {{within a specific}} <b>font</b> <b>weight,</b> caps height, x-height, ascender and descender heights are the same. For oblique fonts, the slope is increased from 12° to the 16° of Frutiger's original drawings, and the character widths were adjusted optically. In addition, characters such as &, ®, euro sign, are redesigned, the ampersand to Frutiger's preferred true et ligature.|$|E

50|$|By contrast, a bold <b>font</b> <b>weight</b> makes {{letters of}} a text thicker than the {{surrounding}} text. Bold strongly stands out from regular text, and {{is often used to}} highlight keywords important to the text's content and allowing such words to be visually scanned with ease. For example, printed dictionaries often use boldface for their keywords, and the names of entries can conventionally be marked in bold.If a publisher prefers not to use bold, or has already used it for another purpose, a second form of emphasis can be introduced by using a lightface or thin version of the main text font, although this is not very common.|$|E
5000|$|The logo's design {{consists}} of a circle outline, with the horizontal line and the bottom curve of the stylized numerical [...] "7" [...] placed within it connecting the circle. The Circle 7 logo {{was designed to be}} interchangeable with the circular ABC logo (as redesigned in 1962 by legendary graphic designer Paul Rand) in network and station imaging, although since the late 1990s, the ABC logo was incorporated into the logo design in different variations. It also was used as the name of the production company for locally produced programming by ABC owned-and-operated stations, Circle 7 Productions, which existed prior to ABC's 1985 takeover by Capital Cities Communications. Originally a proprietary logo for ABC's owned-and-operated stations, stations affiliated with the network began using the logo as early as the 1970s. WXYZ-TV retained the logo after ABC's sale of the station to the E. W. Scripps Company in 1986, although its version has gradually adopted a heavier <b>font</b> <b>weight</b> (Scripps then copied this version to former Capital Cities station WKBW-TV, which had long used its own versions of the [...] "Circle 7" [...] with a straight descender instead of a curve, after WKBW came under Scripps ownership in 2014).|$|E

Therefore an automated tutoring system should be able to know whether a concept mentioned in a document is a prerequisite for studying that document, or it can be learned from it. This paper addresses the problem of identifying defined concepts and prerequisite concepts from learning resources in html format. In this paper a supervised machine learning approach was taken to address the problem, based on linguistic features which enclose contextual information and stylistic features such as font size and <b>font</b> <b>weight.</b> This paper shows that contextual information in addition to format information can give better results when used with the SVM classifier than with the (LP) 2 algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Correct {{segmentation}} {{of a web}} table {{into its}} component regions is the essential first step to understanding tabular data. Our algorithmic solution to the segmentation problem relies on the property that strings defining row and column header paths uniquely index each data cell in the table. We segment the table using only “logical layout analysis” without resorting to any appearance features or natural language understanding. We start with a CSV table that preserves the 2 - dimensional structure and contents of the original source table (e. g., an HTML table) but not font size, <b>font</b> <b>weight,</b> and color. The indexing property of table headers implies a four-quadrant partitioning of the table about a minimum index point. The algorithm finds the index point through an efficient guided search. Experimental results on a 200 -table benchmark demonstrate the generality of the algorithm in handling a variety of table styles and forms...|$|E

40|$|Typography is a {{critical}} tool in visual communication. Selecting the appropriate typeface to express and communicate a message is very important. Since most studies on typeface design concentrate on typeface legibility and readability, this thesis focuses on the visual expression of typefaces and their design characteristics. The relationship between typefaces and their personality traits including legible, cheerful, fearful, creative, attractive, formal, sloppy, relaxed, friendly and confident are investigated. A font survey about twenty four typefaces and ten personality traits is conducted {{and a series of}} statistical analyses are performed to discover the correlation between typefaces and their personality traits. As a result, the number of studied typefaces is reduced from twenty four to fifteen and these fifteen typefaces are categorized into four groups according to their personality traits and typographical features. Typeface design characteristics, such as x-height proportion, ascender and descender proportion, <b>font</b> <b>weight,</b> stroke design, counter design as well as character space of these fifteen typefaces are studied in depth. Typeface design characteristics of four different groups are summarized. In addition, the aesthetic design characteristics of studied typefaces are analyzed. The appropriate uses of each of the four groups are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with automatic extraction of titles from the bodies of HTML documents. Titles of HTML documents should be correctly defined in the title fields; however, in reality HTML titles are often bogus. It is desirable to conduct automatic extraction of titles from the bodies of HTML documents. This is an issue which {{does not seem to}} have been investigated previously. In this paper, we take a supervised machine learning approach to address the problem. We propose a specification on HTML titles. We utilize format information such as font size, position, and <b>font</b> <b>weight</b> as features in title extraction. Our method significantly outperforms the baseline method of using the lines in largest font size as title (20. 9 %- 32. 6 % improvement in F 1 score). As application, we consider web page retrieval. We use the TREC Web Track data for evaluation. We propose a new method for HTML documents retrieval using extracted titles. Experimental results indicate that the use of both extracted titles and title fields is almost always better than the use of title fields alone; the use of extracted titles is particularly helpful in the task of named page finding (23. 1 %- 29. 0 % improvements) ...|$|E
