Results of both experiments showed that participants low inambivalence changed their attitude more at the indirect than at the <b>direct</b> <b>level,</b> whereas highly ambivalentparticipants did the opposite. Thus, while manifest resistance did not prevent participants low in ambivalencefrom latent change, the coexistence of pro and con components within the attitude structure allowed highlyambivalent participants {{to comply with the}} majority at the <b>direct</b> <b>level</b> by expressing one of the components,thereby reducing the impact of the message at the indirect level...|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{communication}} in injured hypercubes with faulty links/nodes using <b>directed</b> safety <b>levels</b> is studied in this paper. In this approach, each node u in an n-dimensional hypercube (n-cube) {{is associated with}} a sequence of <b>directed</b> safety <b>levels.</b> A <b>directed</b> safety <b>level</b> asso-ciated with node u is an approximated measure of broadcast capability of performing optimal broadcasting from u in an (n; 1) -subcube containing u. By optimal broadcasting, we mean that the broadcast message reaches each destination through a shortest path (i. e., the length of each path is equal to the Hamming distance between the source and destination). <b>Directed</b> safety <b>levels</b> are based on a special coding scheme generalized from Wu's safety level model and are calculated through n; 1 rounds of information exchanges and updates among neighboring nodes. In this model, fault information of nodes within distance-d is precisely represented to better capture link faults, whereas fault information of nodes outside distance-d is approximated as in the regular safety level model. Optimal broadcasting at node u is guaranteed if node u is globally safe, which is de ned in terms of the <b>directed</b> safety <b>levels</b> associated with u. The <b>directed</b> safety <b>level</b> model with d = 1 ord = 2 has the same asymptotic complexity as the reg-ular safety level model.

40|$|Structural {{topology}} optimisation aims to provide solutions that {{are independent of}} the initial layout, allowing the greatest opportunity {{to find the best}} design. Recent developments have seen increased interest in level set based optimisation, as the solutions obtained possess smooth boundaries and are free of numerical instabilities that affect traditional element based methods. The <b>direct</b> <b>level</b> set based structural {{topology optimisation}} method has been successful in solving a range of problems. However, it does suffer from some drawbacks and limitations. Two of the main issues with the <b>direct</b> <b>level</b> set method are accurate and efficient sensitivity computation on the boundary and initial design dependent solutions for two dimensional problems. These issues are addressed in this thesis by investigating and improving the efficient area-weighted fixed grid method and creating a novel hole creation method for two dimensional problems based on a pseudo third dimension. Uncertainty is important to include during design and optimisation to produce structures that are reliable and robust. Loading magnitude and direction uncertainty is introduced into the minimisation of compliance problem by considering the robust expected compliance objective. An efficient formulation is derived using an analytical approach where uncertainties are normally distributed. The robust problem is then extended to include compliance variance and sensitivities are derived using the adjoint method. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Pyramids and dual class shares are common devices that families use to separate their cash-flow rights from control rights. We also show that such deviations result in significantly lower market to book ratios suggesting large agency costs because of the conflict of interests between controlling families and minority shareholders.

40|$|The International Standard ISO 140 - 5 {{on field}} {{measurements}} of airborne sound insulation of façades establishes that the directivity of the measurement loudspeaker should be {{such that the}} variation in the local <b>direct</b> sound pressure <b>level</b> (ΔSPL) on the sample is ΔSPL < 5 dB (or ΔSPL < 10 dB for large façades). This condition is usually not very easy to accomplish nor is it easy to verify whether the loudspeaker produces such a uniform <b>level.</b> <b>Direct</b> sound pressure <b>levels</b> on the ISO standard façade essentially depend on the distance and directivity of the loudspeaker used. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the test geometry for measuring sound insulation and explains how the loudspeaker directivity, combined with distance, affects the acoustic level distribution on the façade. The first sections of the paper are focused on analysing the measurement geometry and its influence on the <b>direct</b> acoustic <b>level</b> variations on the façade. The most favourable and least favourable positions to minimise these <b>direct</b> acoustic <b>level</b> differences are found, and the angles covered by the façade in the reference system of the loudspeaker are also determined. Then, the maximum dimensions of the façade that meet {{the conditions of the}} ISO 140 - 5 standard are obtained for the ideal omnidirectional sound source and the piston radiating in an infinite baffle, which is chosen as the typical radiation pattern for loudspeakers. Finally, a complete study of the behaviour of different loudspeaker radiation models (such as those usually utilised in the ISO 140 - 5 measurements) is performed, comparing their radiation maps on the façade for searching their maximum dimensions and the most appropriate radiation configurations...|$|R
