5|$|The {{presence}} of a permanent biliary stent (e.g. in pancreatic cancer) slightly <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> cholangitis, but stents of this type are often {{needed to keep the}} bile duct patent under outside pressure.|$|E
5|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, diarrhea, rash, and pain {{at the site}} of injection. It <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile colitis about fourfold. Other {{antibiotics}} may be recommended instead due to this reason. It appears to be generally safe in pregnancy. It is of the lincosamide class and works by blocking bacteria from making protein.|$|E
50|$|The {{issue of}} whether {{angiotensin}} II receptor antagonists slightly <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> myocardial infarction (MI or heart attack) is currently being investigated. Some studies suggest ARBs can <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> MI. However, other studies have found ARBs do not <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> MI. To date, with no consensus on whether ARBs {{have a tendency to}} <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> myocardial infarction, further investigations are underway.|$|R

5|$|Fasting {{is a risk}} factor, {{possibly}} because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves. The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inhibitor isoniazid <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction {{is related to the}} hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear. Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates, have also been reported as risk factors.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium-239 and 240 emit {{ionizing}} radiation {{in the form}} of alpha particles. Inhalation is the primary pathway by which plutonium enters the body, though plutonium can also enter the body through a wound. Once inhaled, plutonium <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> lung cancer, liver cancer, bone cancer, and leukemia. Once absorbed into the body, the biological half life of plutonium is about 200 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{anatomical}} {{structure of the}} internal organs and tissues of the female reproductive tract provides a pathway for pathogens to ascend from the vagina to the pelvic cavity thorough the infundibulum.

5|$|Variations on the Johns Hopkins {{protocol}} are common. The initiation can {{be performed}} using outpatient clinics rather than requiring a stay in hospital. Often there is no initial fast (fasting <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> acidosis and hypoglycaemia and weight loss). Rather than increasing meal sizes over the three-day initiation, some institutions maintain meal size but alter the ketogenic ratio from 2:1 to 4:1.|$|E
5|$|Venous {{thrombosis}} {{may also}} occur in more unusual places: in the veins of the brain, liver (portal vein thrombosis and hepatic vein thrombosis), mesenteric vein, kidney (renal vein thrombosis) and the veins of the arms. Whether thrombophilia also <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> arterial thrombosis (which is {{the underlying cause}} of heart attacks and strokes) is less well established.|$|E
5|$|An {{overhead}} or penetration diving {{environment is}} where the diver enters a space from {{which there is no}} direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.|$|E
25|$|A {{threshold}} value can be varied {{to make the}} test more restrictive or more sensitive, with the more restrictive tests <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> rejecting true positives, and the more sensitive tests <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> accepting false positives.|$|R
50|$|Other {{risk factors}} are poorly understood. However, {{conditions}} that reduce immune function, such as malnutrition, other illnesses, or host genetic differences, may <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing leprosy. Despite this, infection with HIV {{does not appear}} to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> developing leprosy.|$|R
50|$|Topical {{administration}} of steroids and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs are first-line treatment {{for individuals with}} CNV. The administration <b>of</b> steroids can <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> infection, glaucoma, cataracts, herpes simplex recurrence. The anti-inflammatory drugs, however, <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> corneal ulceration and melting.|$|R
5|$|DPB has {{its highest}} {{prevalence}} among the Japanese, at 11 per 100,000 population. Korean, Chinese, and Thai individuals {{with the disease}} have been reported as well. A genetic predisposition among East Asians is suggested. The disease {{is more common in}} males, with the male to female ratio at 1.42:1 (or about 5 men to 3 women). The average onset of the disease is around age 40, and two-thirds of those affected are non-smokers, although smoking is not believed to be a cause. The presence of HLA-Bw54 <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> diffuse panbronchiolitis 13.3-fold.|$|E
5|$|Dengue {{is spread}} by {{several species of}} {{mosquito}} of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti. The virus has five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> severe complications. A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.|$|E
5|$|Hypothermia {{is reduced}} body {{temperature}} {{that happens when}} a body loses more heat than it generates. Hypothermia is a major limitation to swimming or diving in cold water. The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which in turn <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> other injuries. Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air, so water temperatures that would be tolerable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia, which may lead to death from other causes in inadequately protected divers.|$|E
50|$|Like other SSRIs, olanzapine/fluoxetine {{carries a}} boxed warning stating {{that it could}} <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> suicidal {{thoughts}} and behaviors in patients aged 24 and under.

5|$|Initially, Sanders and KFC used {{hydrogenated}} {{vegetable oil}} for frying, {{but in the}} 1980s the company began to switch to cheaper oils such as palm or soybean. In the 2000s {{it became apparent that}} these oils contain relatively high levels of trans fat, which <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> heart disease. By April 2007, the chain had switched to trans fat-free soybean oil in all of its US outlets.|$|E
5|$|Metformin is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with any condition that could {{increase the risk of}} lactic acidosis, including kidney disorders (arbitrarily defined as creatinine levels over 150 Î¼mol/l (1.7mg/dl),), lung disease and liver disease. According to the prescribing information, heart failure (in particular, unstable or acute congestive heart failure) <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> lactic acidosis with metformin. A 2007 systematic review of controlled trials, however, suggested metformin is the only antidiabetic drug not associated with any measurable harm {{in people with}} heart failure, and it may reduce mortality in comparison with other antidiabetic agents.|$|E
5|$|Outdoor air pollutants, {{especially}} chemicals {{released from}} the burning of fossil fuels, {{increase the risk of}} lung cancer. Fine particulates (PM2.5) and sulfate aerosols, which may be released in traffic exhaust fumes, are associated with slightly increased risk. For nitrogen dioxide, an incremental increase of 10 parts per billion <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> lung cancer by 14%. Outdoor air pollution is estimated to account for 1â€“2% of lung cancers.|$|E
50|$|Apixaban can <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> {{bleeding}} and may cause serious, potentially fatal, bleeding. Concurrent use with drugs affecting hemostasis (e.g. other anticoagulants, heparin, aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can further <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bleeding.|$|R
50|$|Administration of {{phenylbutazone}} to a horse also receiving flunixin {{has been}} shown to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> toxicity without improving analgesia.

5|$|Some {{studies of}} FH cohorts suggest that {{additional}} risk factors are generally at play {{when a person}} develops atherosclerosis. In addition to the classic risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes, genetic {{studies have shown that}} a common abnormality in the prothrombin gene (G20210A) <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> cardiovascular events in people with FH. Several studies found that a high level of lipoprotein(a) was an additional risk factor for ischemic heart disease. The risk was also found to be higher in people with a specific genotype of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).|$|E
5|$|The drug {{strontium}} ranelate aids bone growth, increases bone density, and {{lessen the}} incidence of vertebral, peripheral, and hip fractures. However, strontium ranelate also <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism and serious cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction. Its use is therefore now restricted. Its beneficial effects are also questionable, since the increased bone density is partially caused by the increased density of strontium over the calcium which it replaces. Strontium also bioaccumulates in the body.|$|E
5|$|Thrombophilia (sometimes {{hypercoagulability}} or a prothrombotic state) is an abnormality {{of blood}} coagulation that <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> thrombosis (blood clots in blood vessels).
