40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} shown that a radially periodic image having a symmetric radial period can be decomposed into a circular Fourier series of circular cosine functions with radial frequencies of f 1 /T, 2 /T, [...] ., and that its Fourier spectrum consists {{of a series of}} half-order derivative <b>impulse</b> <b>rings</b> with radii f n/T (which are the Fourier transforms of the circular cosines in the sum). In the present paper these results are extended to the general case of radially periodic images, where the radial period does not necessarily have a symmetric profile. Such a general radially periodic function can be decomposed into a circular Fourier series which is a weighted sum of circular cosine and sine functions with radial frequencies of f 1 /T, 2 /T, [...] In terms of the spectral domain, the Fourier spectrum of a general radially periodic function consists of half-order derivative impulse n/T (which are the Fourier transforms of the weighted circular cosines and sines in the sum) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract â€” We {{propose to}} apply a {{technique}} called timereversal to UWB communications. In time-reversal a signal is precoded such that it focuses both in time and in space at a particular receiver. Spatial focusing reduces interference to other co-existing systems. Due to temporal focusing, the received power is concentrated within a few taps and the task of equalizer design becomes much simpler than without focusing. Furthermore, temporal focusing allows a large increase in transmission rate compared to schemes that let the <b>impulse</b> response <b>ring</b> out before the next symbol is sent. Our paper introduces time-reversal, investigates the benefit of temporal focusing, and examines the performance of an MMSE-TR equalizer in an UWB channel. I...|$|R

Yet the privilege only resulted in a fresh perturbation about the title-deeds, and longing to consult some one who could advise and sympathize. Ermine Williams would have understood and made her Colonel give help, but Ermine seemed as unattainable as Nova Zembla, and she only heard that the Colonel was absent. Her head as aching with the weary load of doubt, {{and she tried to}} cheat her woe by a restless movement to the windows. She saw Captain Keith riding to the door. It suddenly darted into her mind that here was one who could and would help her. He could see Mauleverer and ascertain what had become of the deeds; he could guess at the amount of danger! She could not forget his kindness on the night of Lovedy's illness, or the gentleness of his manner about the woodcuts, and with a sudden <b>impulse</b> she <b>rang</b> the bell and desired that Captain Keith might be shown in.

40|$|Audible {{effects of}} second-order all-pass {{sections}} with center frequencies {{in the range}} of 1 - 12 kHz were studied in headphone listening experiments. All-pass sections give rise to two effects. 1) A perception of "ringing" or "pitchiness," which is related to an exponentially decaying sinusoid in the impulse response of all-pass sections with high Q factors. The ringing is especially audible for impulsive sounds, whereas it is often masked with everyday sounds such as speech and music. With an <b>impulse</b> signal the <b>ringing</b> was found to be audible when the decay time constant for the sinusoid exceeds approximately 0. 8 ms (peak group delay of 1. 6 ms), independent of the center frequency within the frequency range studied. 2) A lateral shift of the auditory image, which occurs when an all-pass section is inserted in the signal path to only one ear. The shift is related to the low-frequency phase and group delays of the all-pass section, and it was found to be audible whenever t hese exceed approximately 35 s, independent of the signal...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an impulse framework for analyzing the hydrodynamic forces on bodies in flow. This general theoretical framework is widely applicable, {{and it is}} used to address the hydrodynamics of fish propulsion, water entry of spheres, and the offdesign performance of marine propellers. These seemingly-unrelated physics problems share a key common thread: The forces on these fish, spheres, and propellers can be modeled as the sum of the reaction to the rate of change of (1) the pressure impulse required to set up the potential flow about the body, and (2) the vortex impulse required to create the vortical structures {{in the wake of the}} body. Fish generate propulsive forces by creating and manipulating large-scale vortical structures using their body and tail. High-speed particle image velocimetry experiments show that a fish generates two vortex rings during a C-turn maneuver and that the change in momentum of the fish balances the change in pressure impulse plus the vortex <b>impulse</b> of these <b>rings.</b> When a sphere plunges into a basin of water and creates a sub-surface air cavity in place of a vortical wake, the vortex impulse is zero, and the force on the sphere is given by the pressure impulse component. Using data from high-speed imaging experiments, a semi-empirical numerical simulation is developed herein; this numerical model shows how the presence of the cavity alters the unsteady pressure force on the sphere and modulates the dynamics of the impact event. During steady propeller operation, the pressure impulse is constant, and the loads on the propeller are given by the vortex impulse component. To analyze these loads, a computational design and analysis tool is presented; this code suite is based on propeller lifting line theory, which is shown to be a special case of the general impulse framework of this thesis. A marine propeller is designed, built, and tested over a range of off-design operating conditions. Experimental results match the predicted performance curve for this propeller, which provides important validation data for the numerical method presented herein. 3 Bringing this thesis full circle, the unsteady startup of the propellor is addressed, which is analogous to the impulsive maneuvering of the swimming fish. As in the fish maneuvering problem, the propellor generates a ring-like vortical wake, and it is shown herein how the vortex <b>impulse</b> of these <b>rings</b> provides thrust for the propellor. With the perspective of the impulse framework developed in this thesis, the results of these tandem experimental investigations and numerical simulations provide deeper insight into classical fluid-dynamics theory and modern experimental hydrodynamics. by Brenden P.

40|$|Background. Based on {{epicardial}} mapping, different {{mechanisms of}} termination of reentrant ventric-ular tachycardia by various pharmacological interventions are described. Methods and Results. In 40 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, rings of anisotropic left ventricular epicardium {{were made by}} a cryoprocedure. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia based on continuous circus movement of the <b>impulse</b> around the <b>ring</b> was induced by programmed stimulation. Increasing doses of heptanol (n= 10), potassium (n= 10), tetrodotoxin (n= 6), RP 62719 (a new class III drug) (n= 4), flecainide (n= 5), and propafenone (n= 5) were administered to terminate ventricular tachycardia. Epicardial mapping (248 points) was used to study the mechanism of termination of ventricular tachycardia. In 28 of 40 hearts, ventricular tachycardia terminated because the drugs produced complete conduction block of the impulse in {{a segment of the}} reentrant pathway. In the remaining 12 hearts (heptanol, n = 2; potassium, n= 3; tetrodotoxin, n = 2; RP 62719, n = 2; flecainide, n = 1; and propafenone, n= 2), termination of ventricular tachycardia occurred by collision of the circulating impulse with a spontaneous antidromic wave front reflected within the circuit. This phenomenon occurred when the circulating impulse encountered an arc of functional conduction block that did not extend along the whole width of the ring. As a result, the impulse dissociated into a continuing orthodromic circulatin...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis work was to explore challenges related to ULS wave loading on offshore wind turbines, with special emphasis on large-diameter inertia-dominated monopile foundations. Experimental studies testing ULS loads on a 6. 9 -m diameter pile in eight different three-hour sea states were performed in two water depths. The wave conditions were set to represent those at location 2 of Creyke Beck B at Dogger Bank, with specified sea state return periods up to 1000 years. The tested structure was a rigid smooth-surfaced bottom-fixed pile with a flexible rotational base stiffness. Wave elevation, pile-top acceleration, shear force and moment time realizations were measured. In addition, the runs were video-taped for deterministic studies. A numerical model was developed in MATLAB, considering an idealized single degree-of-freedom rotational system with a rigid pile and flexible base stiffness. The program includes two general force models generating the Morison or the FNV excitation forces. The Morison model includes the option of running either shallow, intermediate or deep water, with or without Wheeler stretching. In addition, an impulsive force term is included, aimed at evaluating the impact of an individual spilling breaker. The FNV model is expanded to include the finite-depth vertical kinematic distribution and dispersion relation. This is inconsistent with the assumption of deep water in the derivation of the FNV formulae. The model tests were shown to give less than a 1 % deviation in Hs for repeated sea states. The agreement in Hs between the calibration tests and tests with the model was within a - 3 % to 3 % range for all sea states, whilst the discrepancy in nominal and effective Hs varied between a 12 % reduction to a 3 % increase for the calibrated waves. The greatest decrease in Hs occurred for the roughest sea state, indicating {{a large amount of}} breaking waves. Throughout the tests an excessive first-mode motion was observed. The pile was almost constantly oscillating at its eigenfrequency, even in between large wave groups. The cause is thought to have been a combination of self-excitation from radiated waves reflecting off the wavemaker, the conservative mode shape and the low (but realistic) damping level. Generally, the longer moment arm, i. e. the greatest water depth, generated the largest loads. The relative difference was smaller for Tp = 15 s than for Tp = 11. 25 s, indicating the effect of increased wave non-linearity causing higher loads. The largest response moments for almost every sea state were a result of a breaking wave impacting the structure. However, uncertainty remains regarding the excitation mechanism, as to whether it is caused by the <b>impulse</b> load or <b>ringing</b> induced by non-linear wave components. The feasibility of the metocean conditions are questioned, due to the large amount of breaking for the roughest sea states. There is reason to believe that shallow-water effects at Dogger Bank are not properly considered. The relative propagation distance for an unstable energy-dissipating breaking wave before impacting a turbine could be significantly larger in real life than in the wave flume. The FNV force gave the most conservative response moment values, the finite-depth version more so than the one for deep water. The Morison force gave unconservative responses for the roughest sea states. The FNV formulae implementation was validated, yet uncertainty regarding the linearity of the measured input waves still remains...|$|R
