40|$|In {{this work}} we present the {{fabrication}} {{and operation of}} incandescent microlamps for integrated optics applications. This microlamp emits white and infrared light from a chromium resistor embedded in a free-standing silicon oxynitride (SiO(x) N(y)) cantilever that can be coupled to an optical waveguide. In fact, the chromium resistor is sandwiched between layers of SiO(x) N(y) that isolate it from the atmosphere, while <b>electric</b> current <b>heats</b> the <b>resistor</b> to incandescent temperatures. The same SiO(x) N(y) material used in the microlamp fabrication {{is also used to}} produce the optical waveguides to allow a monolithic integration of light source and optical circuit. Front-side bulk micromachining of the silicon substrate in potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution is used to fabricate the cantilevers that thermally isolate the resistors from the substrate, thus reducing the heat transfer and the current required to light the lamp.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the industrial {{application of a}} microcontroller for a vitroceramic cooker. The vitroceramic surface is clustered into a matrix with of cells, each one containing one <b>heating</b> <b>resistor</b> and one infrared emitter- receiver pair which detects {{the presence or absence}} of a receptacle on its cell. With this information, a microcontroller fires only those resistors arranged under the base of a receptacle. This patented vitroceramic cooker presents many advantages over traditional ones; for instance, power consumption is optimized, as only the useful ceramic surface is heated. Furthermore, when the object is removed from the surface, the <b>heating</b> <b>resistors</b> are powered off, so there is no risk for the fires being left on, which is of great interest for blind people. Acoustic signals can also be generated indicating the existence of <b>heated</b> <b>resistors...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been carried out to determine the optimum spacing ratio among the heated elements in the cooling of electronic package. Three-by-three <b>heated</b> <b>resistors</b> with different spacing ratio are mounted on the substrate that in turn rests in a tunnel. The experimental results show that the conventional equi-spaced arrangement might not be the optimum option, and a better thermal performance could be obtained when the center-to-center distances between the resistors follow a geometric series. At Re = 800, when the spacing ratio among the <b>heated</b> <b>resistors</b> is 1. 8, the highest temperature can decrease 8. 24 % and the temperature difference among resistors can reduce about 27. 62 % compared to that of the equi-spaced arrangement.
