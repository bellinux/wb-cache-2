30|$|Gelatin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{versatile}} gelling agents in food applications due to its special texture and the ‘melt-in-mouth’ perception. In addition, gelatin has a variety of applications in the pharmaceutical and photographic industry (Haug et al. [2004]). Gelatin has been used as an additive for improving elasticity, consistency, and stability of foods (Arvanitoyannis [2002]). <b>Fish</b> <b>gelatin</b> (FG) was added into surimi gel, but it resulted in the decrease in gel strength (Hernandez-Briones et al. [2009]). Gelatin is obtained by hydrolyzing the collagen present in the bones and skin, which are generated as byproducts during animal slaughtering and processing. Bovine and porcine skin and bone are the important sources for <b>gelatin</b> production. Recently, <b>fish</b> bones <b>and</b> skins have gained increasing attention as alternative raw material. Those byproducts generated by fish filleting can account for as much as 75 % of the total weight of catches (Shahidi and Botta [1994]). Gelatin from different sources has varying properties, mainly related not only to the amino acid composition but also to the α-chain, β- or γ-component, and molecular-weight distribution (Johnston-Banks [1990]). The intrinsic differences between mammalian <b>and</b> <b>fish</b> <b>gelatins</b> employed may determine different properties of gel (Benjakul et al. [2009]).|$|R

40|$|Fish is {{a common}} trigger of severe, food-allergic reactions. Only {{a limited number of}} {{proteins}} induce specific IgE-mediated immune reactions. The major fish allergens are the parvalbumins. They are members of the calcium-binding EF-hand protein family characterized by a conserved protein structure. They represent highly cross-reactive allergens for patients with specific IgE to conserved epitopes. These patients might experience clinical reactions with various fish species. On the other hand, some individuals have IgE antibodies directed against unique, species-specific parvalbumin epitopes, and these patients show clinical symptoms only with certain fish species. Furthermore, different parvalbumin isoforms and isoallergens are present in the same <b>fish</b> <b>and</b> might display variable allergenicity.

40|$|International audienceChitosan <b>and</b> <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin</b> {{were used}} to {{formulate}} active biobased films containing an antioxidant (coumarin). After drying, the films were irradiated at 40 and 60 kGy using an electron beam accelerator. The effect of irradiation on the film properties {{as well as the}} coumarin release mechanism were investigated and compared with the control. Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) revealed free radical formation during irradiation in films containing coumarin. Antioxidant addition and/or irradiation treatment at a dose of 60 kGy resulted in a shift of amide A and amide B peaks. Furthermore a shift of amide II band was only observed for the control film at the same dose. Irradiation allowed improving the thermal stability of the control films. Both irradiation process and addition of coumarin increased the surface wettability (increase of the polar component of the surface tension). From the water barrier analysis, neither irradiation nor coumarin addition influenced the permeability at the lower RH gradient used (0 - 30 % RH). Using the higher RH gradient (30 - 84 %) induced a rise of the WVP of all films (containing or not coumarin) after irradiation treatment. At 60 kGy, the tensile strength of only the control films increased significantly. Considering coumarin release from the film in aqueous medium, the apparent diffusion coefficient of coumarin is two times reduced after irradiation. Irradiation also allowed to better protect the incorporated antioxidant. Indeed, the amount of coumarin in the non-irradiated film was significantly lowered compared to the initial quantity, which is probably due to chemical reactivity...|$|R

The biopolymers were degraded by acid or enzymatic hydrolysis in order to produce small peptides and oligomers with different molecular weights. These were conjugated with Alexa 488 fluorescent dyes. Abdominal skins from health adults after plastic surgery were used in the transdermal experiments where the epidermal side of the skin was treated with tape, acetone and microneedles in order to influence and decrease the skin barrier. The transdermal experiments were performed by the Franz diffusion cell system and fluorescent sample dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or only DMSO (control sample) was added to the epidermal side of the skin. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope was used to visualize the penetration of biopolymers in the skin tissue. In addition, an experiment where paracetamol was applied to the skin was performed to evaluate the skin penetration kinetics. In order to achieve successful skin penetration of the biopolymers, there was a need for 20 - 24 hours of incubation and extensive pre-treatment of the skin prior to the transdermal experiments. Microneedles were found to be most enhancing on skin penetration, while tapestripping was not.

However, optical microscopy showed that there was always a small population of large droplets present in the emulsions after homogenization and some oil destabilization (≥ 2 wt%).

Results characterization showed that the <b>fish</b> <b>gelatins</b> were comparable to the <b>fish</b> <b>gelatins</b> from other <b>fish</b> species previously reported. They appeared snowy white in color with crystal-like and light texture. The gelatine extracted from “kerapu ” had the strongest fishy odor, followed by the gelatines derived from “jenahak”, “kembung ” and “kerisi”. In terms of bloom strength, the gelatin extracted from “kerapu ” {{was found to be}} the strongest one compared to others, with the bloom value of more than 2000 g. The gelatins developed in this study contained almost all essential amino acids, with glycine being the most predominant one...|$|R
50|$|Fish stock {{forms the}} basis of many dishes, {{particularly}} soups <b>and</b> sauces. A <b>fish</b> consommé {{is a type of}} clear soup made from richly flavored fish stock that has been clarified usually through a fining process involving egg protein. Fish consommés usually have too little natural <b>gelatin,</b> so the <b>fish</b> stock may be double-cooked or supplemented. Since <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin</b> melts at a lower temperature than gelatins of other meats, fish aspic is more delicate and melts more readily in the mouth. Dehydrated stock can be formed into small cubes (pictured at right) called stock cubes.|$|R
