25|$|Captain John G. Foster, a Union Army {{engineering}} officer observing from Fort Sumter, wrote {{reports to}} his superiors {{about the progress}} of the battery construction. Foster's assessment of the battery was dismissive, “...I think it can be destroyed by our fire before it has time to do much damage...” and he followed a few days later with, “...I do not think this floating battery will prove very formidable...” Nonetheless, his superior, Major Robert Anderson was apprehensive enough that he inquired for specific instructions from Washington regarding the threat of the battery. He was instructed that if he became convinced that the battery was advanced for the purpose of immediate attack then he would be justified in firing on it but <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> being moved for the purposes of general emplacement that he should exercise forbearance.|$|E
500|$|Azaria's friends {{refer to}} him as [...] "the freakish mimic" [...] due to his ability to copy almost anyone's voice, {{instantly}} after he has heard it. As a child he believed that everyone could do this, but later {{realized that it was}} not a common talent. Azaria can [...] "remember every voice I hear, famous or otherwise... they kind of remain in the memory banks, so I'm ready to trot them out." [...] Azaria was glad to have found the [...] "ultimate outlet" [...] for this skill, in The Simpsons. He [...] "didn't realize it , but it became like a lab for a character actor. I had to do so many voices." [...] In the early 2000s, Azaria felt he had reached the maximum number of voices he was capable of: [...] "For the first 10 years of The Simpsons, I would develop a bunch of voices. And then... I hit a point when I was tapped out. Every noise I can make, I have made. Even characters like Gargamel, I've done. Even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> two or three lines, at some point I've done something similar on The Simpsons, at least somewhere along the line." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 20th century Marxist controversies {{about the}} TRPF focused on five issues: (1) the {{relevance}} of the TRPF for understanding and explaining capitalist economic crises; (2) the role of profitability tendencies in the final collapse of capitalism; (3) the political significance of the TRPF for the policy of workers' parties; (4) the theoretical consistency of the TRPF argument; and (5) the data about empirical profitability trends in the long term. In addition, philosophers and economists also discussed (6) the sense in which the TRPF could be considered an economic [...] "law", since it seemed unclear how a necessary tendency could be [...] "necessary" [...] or inevitable, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> a tendency, in combination with other tendencies.|$|E

2500|$|There were suicides {{during the}} war despair tipping men, rather than women, over the edge. Civilians, OT workers and Germans were affected. [...] Civilian suicides were {{recorded}} as linked to {{the fear of the}} occupation, a Jew and several over deportation fears. A number of soldiers, both officers and men committed suicide to avoid transfer to the eastern front, after hearing of family losses from bombing Germany and others in May 1945 on hearing of the death of Hitler. [...] In addition there would be a number of elderly people who died having just given up the will to live however for most, when at a depressing low, something always occurred to raise morale, even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> a rumour.|$|E
