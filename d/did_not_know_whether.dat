5|$|Show creator Daniel Knauf {{believed}} Carnivàles religious aspects {{stemmed from}} the epic {{of good and evil}} as a major fabric of the 1930s, while executive producer Ronald D. Moore regarded religion as a way to express the struggle of good versus evil, faith, and the nature of humanity. Neither the audience nor the actors were given advice on how to interpret the show's biblical imagery. Clancy Brown, the actor who portrayed Brother Justin, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> his character was the Creature of Light or Darkness during the first season. He however thought that the visions made Brother Justin believe to be on a righteous mission of God until late in the first season. Compared to Brother Justin, Brown stated he practiced religion in moderate ways.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Soma Bringer was first hinted at when Nintendo filed a trademark {{for the title}} alongside others. It was officially announced in October that year at a Nintendo press conference. Published by Nintendo, Soma Bringer was the first Monolith Soft title to be released after its acquisition by Nintendo in April 2007. It was released on February 22, 2008. After positive impressions from previews during public gaming events in Japan, both IGN and 1UP.com voiced a hope that the game would receive a localization. Speaking in 2010, Saga said that she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> it would be released outside Japan, or whether further games set in the Soma Bringer universe would be developed.|$|E

5|$|The parity of zero is {{relevant}} to odd–even rationing, in which cars may drive or purchase gasoline on alternate days, according to the parity of the last digit in their license plates. Half of the numbers in a given range end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 {{and the other half}} in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, so it makes sense to include 0 with the other even numbers. However, in 1977, a Paris rationing system led to confusion: on an odd-only day, the police avoided fining drivers whose plates ended in 0, because they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> 0 was even. To avoid such confusion, the relevant legislation sometimes stipulates that zero is even; such laws have been passed in New South Wales and Maryland.|$|E
25|$|The {{expenses}} disclosures {{were published}} {{over an extended}} period of time, with the focus moving to different MPs daily.

25|$|In October 1935 District Attorney William E. Parke {{requested}} that {{a grand jury}} investigate the fatal shooting of Evelyn Hoey. The prosecutor asked that the shooting be studied {{as well as the}} conduct of members of the coroner's jury, and people with whom they had been in contact. Particularly he wanted to identify their association with certain newspaper men who covered the inquest. Parke believed the jury's verdict indicated they felt a homicide had been committed. After asking for a grand jury he said he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> any new evidence had been found.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{also charged}} that the {{authorities}} did not organize the siege properly, including failing to keep the scene secure from entry by civilians, while the emergency services were not prepared during the 52 hours of the crisis. The Russian government has been also heavily criticized {{by many of the}} local people who, days and even months after the siege, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> their children were alive or dead, as the hospitals were isolated from the outside world. Two months after the crisis, human remains and identity documents were found by a local driver, Muran Katsanov, in the garbage landfill at the outskirts of Beslan; the discovery prompted further outrage.|$|E
25|$|The Confederate Gettysburg Campaign {{began on}} June 3, 1863 with the Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia, under its new commander, Lieutenant General Richard S.

By the next day, Hooker {{learned of the}} Confederate movement but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> Lee was attempting to move north or to attack Hooker's right flank or whether the Confederates were moving their infantry or just cavalry. Hooker proposed to attack Lieutenant General A. P. Hill's Third Corps at Fredericksburg but President Abraham Lincoln and Union Army General-in-Chief Henry Halleck thought that the plan was too risky and would enable Lee to turn his force at Culpeper to attack Hooker's flank, possibly while Hooker's men were engaged in crossing the Rappahannock. Hooker gave up the idea.|$|E
25|$|The armstice between Russia and Germany lapsed on 18 February 1918 and the Operation Faustschlag {{was soon}} {{launched}} by the Germans. This included the invasion of Åland, as the Germans <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> Sweden would remain neutral or join the Allies. The Germans had their interests in Finland because of the access to the Arctic Sea and the country's presence near the Murmansk railway and the Bolshevik capital of Saint Petersburg. To justify the invasion, Germany ordered a request of military assistance from their allies in Finland. The White Senate message requesting the German invasion of Åland reached Berlin on 22 February. The German intention was to gather troops to Åland and then land the Finnish mainland in the west coast town of Rauma. As the ice in the Bothnian Bay was too thick, the landing was finally made in Hanko, Southern Finland, by the Baltic Sea Division {{in the first days}} of April.|$|E

25|$|Parks and Recreation {{struggled}} in the Nielsen ratings throughout its entire run on NBC. The series premiere {{was seen by}} 6.77million viewers, which media outlets described as a strong opening, comparable to the average Nielsen ratings for 30 Rock, another Thursday-night show on NBC. Viewership declined almost every week {{over the rest of}} the season, culminating in a season low of 4.25million viewers for the final episode. Parks and Recreation ended the first season with an overall average rating of 5.97million viewers viewers, ranking 94th in a list of 193 network shows for the 2008–09 television season. The Office experienced similarly poor ratings during its first season and later became a success. Low viewership presented a greater challenge for Parks and Recreation because NBC now trailed CBS, ABC and Fox in the ratings, and the move of comedian Jay Leno from The Tonight Show to a variety show in NBC's 10:00pm weeknight slot left less room on the network's primetime schedule. At the end of the season, members of the cast and crew were stressed because they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> the show would be renewed.|$|E

500|$|Congress had {{appointed}} General Lee {{to command}} the Continental Army troops in the southern colonies, and his movements by land shadowed those of Clinton's fleet as it sailed south.

He headed for Charleston, saying [...] " [...] confess I know not whether I shall go to or from the enemy." [...] He arrived in Charleston shortly after the fleet anchored outside the harbor, and took command of the city's defenses. He immediately ran into a problem: the South Carolina troops (militia or the colonial regiments) {{were not on the}} Continental line, and thus not formally under his authority. Some South Carolina troops resisted his instructions, and Rutledge had to intervene by proclaiming Lee in command of all South Carolina forces.|$|E

Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, described the Strokes as [...] "a great groove band", and noted that [...] "the beats implode, clashing/resolving with punky brevity and gnarly faux simplicity". In a perfect 10 review, NME reviewer John Robinson indicated that Is This It {{was one of the}} best debut LPs by a guitar band during the past 20years.
