40|$|The fuel {{assemblies}} of the Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR) are constituted of rod bundles {{arranged in}} a regular square configuration by spacer grids placed along its length. The presence of the spacer grids promote two antagonist effects on the core: a desirable increase of the local heat transfer downstream the grids and an adverse increase of the pressure drop due the constriction on the coolant flow area. Most spacer grids are designed with mixing vanes which cause a cross and swirl flow between and within the subchannels, enhancing even more the heat transfer performance in the grid vicinity. The improvement of the heat transfer increases the <b>departure</b> <b>from</b> the <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> ratio, allowing higher operating power in the reactor.

50|$|At {{standard}} {{atmospheric pressure}} and low temperatures, no boiling occurs and the heat transfer rate {{is controlled by the}} usual single-phase mechanisms.

40|$|International audienceThe boiling crisis (BC) is {{well known}} in the world of heat and mass transfer. It is a {{transition}} <b>from</b> <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> (i. e. boiling in its usual sense) to film boiling, where the heater is covered by a continuous vapour film. The BC is observed when the heat flux from the heater exceeds a critical value. Heat exchange then falls down and endangers the exchanger whose temperature rises abruptly. The physical mechanism of the BC is still under debate. We propose the recoil force (the thrust of vapour production) at the solid–liquid–vapour contact line to lie at the origin of the BC. At large heat flux, the recoil force tends to spread the vapour bubble that otherwise would not wet the solid. We give both analytical and numerical analysis in support of this idea. We also report experiments under microgravity conditions performed with near-critical fluids (SF 6 and CO 2). The absence of gravity effects and the vicinity of the critical point where the liquid–vapour surface tension vanishes emphasize the influence of the recoil force: during heating, the vapour drop is indeed seen to spread...|$|R

30|$|In {{terms of}} <b>boiling</b> regimes, <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> is an {{efficient}} heat-transfer mechanism; however, for {{the incorporation of}} <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> in most practical applications, {{it is imperative that}} the critical heat flux (CHF) is not exceeded. CHF phenomenon is the thermal limit during a heat-transfer phase change; at the CHF point the heat transfer is maximised, followed by a drastic degradation after the CHF point. Basically, the boiling process changes <b>from</b> efficient <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> to lesser-efficient film boiling at the CHF point. The occurrence of CHF is accompanied by localised overheating at the heated surface, and a decrease in the heat-transfer rate. An increase in the CHF of the boiling system would therefore allow for more compact and effective cooling systems for nuclear reactors, air-conditioning units, etc. For decades, researchers have been trying to develop more efficient heat-transfer fluids, and also to increase the CHF of the boiling system which would, in turn, improve process efficiency and reduce operational costs. This is where nanofluids could play a key role; nanofluids could potentially revolutionise heat transfer.|$|R

Consequently, a more thorough understanding of the heat transfer characteristics of liquid nitrogen is required. In these investigations the transient heating characteristics of liquid nitrogen to states of <b>nucleate</b> and film <b>boiling</b> under different liquid flow conditions are examined. Using a metal hot wire/plate technique, it is verified that there is a premature transition to film boiling in the transient case at power levels as much as 30 percent lower than under steady state <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> conditions. It is also shown that the premature transition can be reduced or eliminated depending on the flow velocity The second part of this research analyses the nucleation (boiling) process from a dynamical systems point of view.

One goal is to discover some indicator or signature in the data that anticipates the transition <b>from</b> <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> to film/boiling. Some of the important variables that make up the boiling system are the temperature of the heater and the heat flux through the heater surface into the liquid nitrogen. Results, gained by plotting the systemâ€™s trajectory in the heat flux-temperature plane, are that on average the system follows a counterclockwise trajectory. A physical model is constructed that explains this behavior.

40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} the pool boiling of one-component fluids {{with a focus}} on the effects of surface wettability on the single-bubble dynamics. We employed the dynamic van der Waals theory [Phys. Rev. E 75, 036304 (2007) ], a diffuse-interface model for liquid-vapor flows involving liquid-vapor transition in nonuniform temperature fields. We first perform simulations for bubbles on homogeneous surfaces. We find that an increase in either the contact angle or the surface superheating can enhance the bubble spreading over the heating surface and increase the bubble departure diameter as well and therefore facilitate the transition into film boiling. We then examine the dynamics of bubbles on patterned surfaces, which incorporate the advantages of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. The central hydrophobic region increases the thermodynamic probability of bubble nucleation while the surrounding hydrophilic region hinders the continuous bubble spreading by pinning the contact line at the hydrophobic-hydrophilic intersection. This leads to a small bubble departure diameter and therefore prevents the transition <b>from</b> <b>nucleate</b> <b>boiling</b> into film boiling. With the bubble nucleation probability increased and the bubble departure facilitated, the efficiency of heat transfer on such patterned surfaces is highly enhanced, as observed experimentally [Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer 57, 733 (2013) ].

For a single evaporating drop, the Leidenfrost point occurs when the capillary and gravitational forces are surpassed by the upward pressure of the escaping vapor. This thesis develops an analytical model to predict the Leidenfrost point for a microstructured surface. The microstructure consists of a regular array of square posts geometrically defined by aspect ratio and spacing ratio. The vapor pressure is modeled using the momentum equation for flow in a porous medium. Varying the geometric parameters indicated that aspect ratio and spacing ratio must be optimized to achieve the maximum Leidenfrost temperature. For a water drop evaporating from a silicon surface, the maximum Leidenfrost temperature is predicted to occur with an aspect ratio of 1. 3 and a spacing ratio of 1. 5. [mu]L water drops were evaporated from a smooth surface made of silicon and porous surfaces made of aluminum oxide.

One popular technology, immersion cooling using pool boiling, is limited by a catastrophic transition <b>from</b> <b>nucleate</b> to film <b>boiling</b> at a well-defined critical heat flux limit. The present work used an acoustic emitter located near the heated surface to actively control the boiling process. When vapor bubbles reached a predetermined size, the acoustic field forced them to detach from the heated surface. This led to an increase in the heat transfer rate and a delay in the transition <b>from</b> <b>nucleate</b> to film <b>boiling.</b> Preliminary work demonstrated acoustically enhanced bubble detachment from a heated surface over a frequency range of kHz to MHz. For water, the critical heat flux limit was increased from 107 W/cm 2 at 122 °C to 299 W/cm 2 at 136 °C. This work also showed that the excitation process is robust enough to work against buoyancy forces, if present. Thus, acoustically enhanced boiling in a closed heat transfer cell has the potential to produce a simple, high performance device that would be attractive {{for a wide variety of}} high-heat-flux applications...|$|R
