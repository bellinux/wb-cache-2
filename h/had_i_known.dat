500|$|Despite {{the tension}} between the two men during the production, when Price saw the movie the {{following}} year, he admitted that he finally understood what Reeves had been after and wrote the young director a ten-page letter praising the film. Reeves wrote Price back, [...] "I knew you would think so." [...] Years after Reeves's death, Price said, [...] "...I realized what he wanted was a low-key, very laid-back, menacing performance. He did get it, but I was fighting him almost every step of the way. <b>Had</b> <b>I</b> <b>known</b> what he wanted, I would have cooperated." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{joining the}} cast of Tangled, Moore was {{initially}} unaware that the film was slated to be Walt Disney Animation Studios' 50th animated feature film. Since that time, she has received her ignorance with gratitude, explaining, [...] "I feel lucky because I would've probably felt a bit more pressure <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>known</b> going into the recording process." [...] Moore hardly worked with co-stars Zachary Levi and Donna Murphy, who provided the voices of Flynn Rider and Mother Gothel, respectively, never meeting Murphy and having only met Levi once to record their characters' duet [...] "I See the Light". Moore {{was surprised to learn}} that she would be isolated from her co-stars against initial expectations that [...] "we're all going to be chummy, hanging out at the studio laughing and going out to dinner together". Moore had little idea of what her character looked like because, in terms of visual aid, she was only provided with rough, incomplete sketches and storyboards, while [...] "everything else had to be explained" [...] by Howard and Greno. The majority of the images were created by Moore herself in her own mind.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, Mulgrew narrated a {{documentary}} film, The Principle, {{that aims to}} promote the discredited idea of the geocentric model. Mulgrew {{said that she was}} misinformed as to the purpose of the documentary, going on to say [...] "I am not a geocentrist, nor am I in any way a proponent of geocentrism... I do not subscribe to anything Robert Sungenis has written regarding science and history and, <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>known</b> of his involvement, would most certainly have avoided this documentary." ...|$|E

He was an authority {{in the sense that he}} was a scholar. He did research into papers that other people wrote. So he was able to be used to get into evidence these matters that we needed. And it’s unfortunate that all this publicity has come up over it, but the lawsuit, I think, is on sound ground and we’re carrying it forward.|$|E
2500|$|Next, Henslow {{called upon}} Admiral Robert FitzRoy, {{who had been}} Darwin's captain and {{companion}} on the voyage of the Beagle twenty-five years earlier. FitzRoy denounced Darwin's book and, [...] "lifting an immense Bible first {{with both hands and}} afterwards with one hand over his head, solemnly implored the audience to believe God rather than man". He was believed to have said: [...] "I believe that this is the Truth, and <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>known</b> then what I know now, I would not have taken him [...] aboard the Beagle." ...|$|E

That was the impetus for doing what I did; that's the reason I jammed HBO; that's the reason I sent them a polite message.

I didn't grasp the fact that no one understood my motives and that everyone would make assumptions. <b>Had</b> <b>I</b> <b>known</b> that up front I would have been much more fervent in explaining my motivations.

"Reading the {{statements}} from last weekend's sessions {{reminded me that}} it was probably the senior warden, not the girl's mother, who in 1975 reported John's abuse, after which I immediately told him to leave the parish, and that {{in order to maintain the}} confidentiality of both John and the girl, I did not tell the parents, who nonetheless confronted me when they had found out four years later. Until reading {{the statements}} I had never before known that John's destructive behavior did not stop, but rather increased, in the parish to which he went after leaving my parish. That I could have prevented that from happening <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>known</b> to act differently is extremely grievous to me.

2500|$|Due to the sculpture's {{potential}} for controversy, {{the point that}} each country's piece was designed by an artist from that country was strongly stressed by the Czech government. According to Lidové noviny, Czech Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra remarked: [...] "The fact remains that we have provided a platform for free artistic expression {{and that is how}} Entropa must be viewed. But, <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>known</b> the circumstances were different than we had thought {{for a year and a}} half, I would not have authorized it." [...] Vondra attempted to distance the Czech government from Černý's work early on, saying,It is a piece of artnothing else... If Europe is not strong enough to look at this, it would be a tragedy. It is Europe through the eyes of 27 artists. It is not Europe through the eyes of the Czech presidency.|$|E
2500|$|Great Britain: The torch relay leg held in London, {{the host}} {{city of the}} 2012 Summer Olympics, on April 6 began at Wembley Stadium, passed through the City of London, and {{eventually}} ended at O2 Arena {{in the eastern part}} of the city. The [...] leg took a total of seven and a half hours to complete, and attracted protests by pro-Tibetan independence and pro-Human Rights supporters, prompting changes to the planned route and an unscheduled move onto a bus, which was then briefly halted by protestors. Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has officially complained to Beijing Organising Committee about the conduct of the tracksuit-clad Chinese security guards. The Chinese officials, seen manhandling protesters, were described by both the London Mayor Ken Livingstone and Lord Coe, chairman of the London Olympic Committee as [...] "thugs". A Metropolitan police briefing paper revealed that security for the torch relay cost £750,000 and the participation of the Chinese security team had been agreed in advance, despite the Mayor stating, [...] "We did not know beforehand these thugs were from the security services. <b>Had</b> <b>I</b> <b>known</b> so, we would have said no." ...|$|E

2500|$|I Love You, Man is {{the third}} {{collaboration}} between Paul Rudd and Jason Segel, following the Judd Apatow projects Knocked Up and Forgetting Sarah Marshall, while writer/director John Hamburg previously worked with Segel on Apatow's Undeclared television series. [...] It only took one lunch to get Segel and Rudd {{to sign on to}} do the film and this set the stage for other actors to sign on. [...] On February 13, 2008 it was announced that Rashida Jones would be in the female lead opposite Rudd. [...] Later, in an interview with firstshowing.net, Jones revealed that because Segel and Rudd were already attached to the project she [...] "knew immediately that it was gonna be even funnier than I would think." [...] At the beginning of the March 31, 2008 week, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Jaime Pressly had joined the film's cast, playing the best friend of Rashida Jones' character. [...] Hamburg comically stated that he was lucky in casting J.K. Simmons because his contract states [...] "he has to be in {{one out of every four}} movies made." [...] Jon Favreau started working on the film the same week Iron Man came out, a film which he directed. He said he [...] "probably wouldn't have agreed to have done it <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>known</b> my life was going to be that shape", but Iron Man star Robert Downey, Jr. told him that [...] "It is the best thing you could do" [...] he said 'chop wood, carry water,' which is what they do in the Kung Fu movies to keep you humble." ...|$|E
