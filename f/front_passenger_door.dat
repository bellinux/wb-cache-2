2500|$|Hudson {{resorted to}} a variety of {{marketing}} ploys to get consumers interested in the Jet, including the [...] "Tea Cup Test". This Fuel economy test utilized special kits comprising a glass cylinder, valves and rubber hoses that Hudson dealers attached to test cars. The glass cylinder was mounted {{to the inside of the}} <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>door,</b> with the hoses feeding into the engine's fuel line. An amount of gasoline equal to the amount held in a tea cup was added to the glass cylinder, and the car was driven away by a potential customer while a salesperson monitored the cylinder in an effort to prove how far a Jet could travel on that small amount of gasoline.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the first}} {{introductions}} was in 1980 on the Ford Thunderbird, Mercury Cougar, Lincoln Continental Mark VI, and Lincoln Town Car, which Ford called Keyless Entry System (later renamed SecuriCode). It was a keypad on the driver-side exterior door above the door handle. It consisted of a keypad with five buttons that when the code was entered, would unlock the driver's door, with subsequent code entries to unlock all doors, and the trunk. Nissan offered the same technology on the Nissan Maxima and Nissan Fairlady beginning in 1984, essentially using the same approach as Ford, {{with the addition of}} being able to roll the windows down and open the optional moonroof from outside the vehicle on the door handle installed keypad on both the driver's and <b>front</b> <b>passengers</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{fitted with}} a passenger door in the port forward fuselage, and a service door/emergency exit is installed opposite. An airstair installed below the <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>door</b> was available as an option as was an airstair in the tailcone. This also doubled as an emergency exit. Available with either two or four overwing exits, the DC-9-10 can seat up to a maximum certified exit limit of 109 passengers. Typical all-economy layout is 90 passengers, and 72 passengers in a more typical mixed-class layout with 12 first and 60 economy-class passengers.|$|E
50|$|Almost all OEM alarms are {{typically}} armed and disarmed with the vehicle's keyless entry remote. On many vehicles the key cylinders {{in the driver}} or <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>door</b> activate switches, so that when a key {{is used in the}} door the alarm will arm or disarm.Some vehicles will arm when the power door lock switch is pressed with the driver's door open, and the door is subsequently closed.Some vehicles will disarm if the ignition is turned on; often when the vehicle is equipped with a key-based immobilizer and an alarm, the combination of the valid key code and the ignition disarms the system.|$|E

Blue and yellow stripes along the bottom of the carriages were replaced by a single yellow stripe and new fuzzy CityRail logos were placed on the driving cars.|$|R
25|$|Sullenberger {{opened the}} cockpit door and ordered evacuation. The crew began {{evacuating}} the passengers through the four overwing window exits and into an inflatable slide/raft deployed from the <b>front</b> right <b>passenger</b> <b>door</b> (the <b>front</b> left slide failed to operate, so the manual inflation handle was pulled). A panicked passenger opened a rear door, which {{a flight attendant}} was unable to reseal. Water was also entering {{a hole in the}} fuselage and through cargo doors that had come open, so as the water rose the attendant urged passengers to move forward by climbing over seats. One passenger was in a wheelchair. Finally, Sullenberger walked the cabin twice to confirm it was empty.|$|R
50|$|In the {{majority}} of configurations, passengers board the ATR 72 using the rear door, a relatively unusual configuration for a passenger aircraft, while the front door is typically used for the loading and unloading of cargo; early customer Finnair intentionally ordered their ATR 72s with a <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>door</b> {{so that they could}} utilize the jet bridges at Helsinki Airport, while operator Air New Zealand's standard rear door aircraft can use jet bridges at airports with this equipment. While passengers are boarding or disembarking the aircraft, a tail stand is set into place as standard procedure to guard against the aircraft nose lifting off the ground.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, Bishopville, South Carolina residents, Leon and Ada Marshall, {{reported}} that their car had been mauled by some kind of animal. Former Lee County Sheriff stated that the damage on the car looks much like the damage from earlier incidents. Deputy Fletcher Williams inspected the car and surmised that teeth {{were responsible for the}} damage, as if the car had been “chewed up.” To further suggest that an animal had been the vandal, a clear trail of saliva was visible from “the <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>door</b> across the front of the vehicle to the driver door” and on the discarded strips of bumper material. He also found long white and brown hairs.|$|E
50|$|On August 25, 1967, {{while leaving}} the Econowash {{laundromat}} at the Dominion Hills Shopping Center, an assassin, hiding {{on the roof}} of the building, fired two bullets into Rockwell's car through the windshield.

His car slowly rolled backwards to a stop and Rockwell staggered out of the <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> side <b>door</b> of the car, stood briefly while pointing upward at the strip mall's rooftop where the shots had come from, and then collapsed on the pavement. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Rockwell's assailant was John Patler, a former ANP/NSWPP member whom Rockwell had ejected from the party for allegedly trying to introduce Marxist doctrine into the party's platforms.|$|R
5000|$|The Flxible New Look bus shares many design {{features}} with the GM New Look bus that {{was introduced in}} 1959, however the Flxible New look bus was somewhat more rugged and solid. Both buses featured large 6-piece [...] "fishbowl" [...] windshields, forward-slanting side windows, fluted aluminum siding, and slide/glide <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>doors.</b> Both buses were also equipped with the same engine: the Detroit Diesel 6V-71 (6-cylinder) / 8V-71 (8-cylinder) diesel engine (however, 150 propane fueled Flxible New Looks were built for the Chicago Transit Authority in the mid-1960s, Detroit Diesel 4-71 (4-cylinder) diesel engines were available for some models in the mid-1960s, and Cummins 165-285 and 903 8-cylinder diesel engines were available until 1973 {{as an alternative to}} the Detroit Diesel engines). Originally, the Flxible New Look was only available in lengths of 35 or 40 ft and widths of 96 or 102 in, however 31 and 33 ft models later became available. Until 1963, these buses carried both the Flxible and the Twin nameplates, with the Twin name located in a small oval beneath the Flxible shield on the front of the buses (Twin Coach had been a manufacturer of transit buses as early as 1927 and sold its transit bus product line to Flxible in 1953). In 1964 and 1965 Flxible produced a suburban model meant for longer distance highway routes, and these buses were equipped with all forward-facing high-backed seats and overhead luggage racks, but lacked a rear exit door and standee windows. Air conditioning was an available option on all models, and in most cases was identifiable by a bulge above the rear window where the roof-mounted condenser and cooling fan were located (some buses were built with under-floor air conditioning). Air-ride suspension was standard on all models.|$|R
2500|$|Most {{cars have}} at least one [...] "dome light" [...] (or [...] "courtesy light") located in or near the ceiling of the {{passenger}} compartment, to provide illumination by which to fasten seatbelts and enter or exit the car. These often have an option to switch on when the <b>front</b> (or any) <b>passenger</b> <b>doors</b> are opened. Many vehicles have expanded this feature, causing the overhead interior light to remain on after all doors are closed, allowing passengers to fasten seat belts with added illumination. The extended lighting cycle usually ends when the vehicle's ignition has begun, or a gradual reduction in light emitted after a couple of minutes if the car isn't started, called [...] "theater" [...] lighting. Interior lighting has been added on some vehicles at the bottom edge of the dashboard, which illuminates the floor for <b>front</b> <b>passengers,</b> or underneath the front seats at the rear, to illuminate the floor for rear seat passengers. This type of convenience lighting approach is also sometimes used to illuminate interior or exterior door handles, exterior step running boards, or electric window switches.|$|R

5000|$|The Isis uses {{a unique}} {{approach}} to the sliding doors in that the <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>door</b> and the rear passenger sliding door interlock when closed, instead of having a doorjamb that the doors attach to. Toyota calls this on the Japanese Wikipedia article [...] "Panoramic Door". This door system is used only on the passenger side. The doors on the driver's side attach with a conventional doorjamb. The front passenger seat can be folded flat upon itself and then tilted forward to further provide passenger access. The doors also interlock with {{the top and bottom}} door openings so that both doors can be opened independently of each other. This door feature was first used by Toyota on the Toyota Raum. This door approach is also used on the U.S.-spec 2000-2006 Toyota Tundra Extra Cab. This type of door was first used on the Nissan Prairie in 1981.|$|E
5000|$|Escape hybrid {{versions}} can {{be identified}} by the [...] "Hybrid" [...] badges located on the <b>front</b> driver's and <b>passenger's</b> <b>doors</b> as well as near the right tailgate.

Safety equipment levels has also been improved with ABS brakes and dual airbags standard across the range, whilst side, curtain, driver's knee airbag and stability and traction control is optional on Ascent and Levin SX models and standard on Conquest, Levin ZR and Ultima models from December 2008 production. Other changes from December 2008 production included a revised 6-speed manual transmission across all models except the auto only Ultima sedan that has improved gear ratios and the adoption of smart entry activation on <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> and back <b>door</b> on Levin ZR model. Although the new hatch is badged Auris name in most world markets, the Corolla name was retained for the Australian market.|$|R
50|$|A rear-entry {{configuration}} can be {{used for}} attended applications in which the wheelchair occupant is not driving the vehicle but rather riding as a passenger. One advantage of a rear-entry vehicle is that, with the exception of parallel parking, no extra room is required for a ramp and the side <b>passenger</b> <b>doors</b> aren’t blocked if a folding-style ramp is installed. In addition, mid-passenger seats can be mounted next to the wheelchair position. Other advantages include more ground clearance and more room for long wheelchairs and/or leg rests. Limitations of the rear-entry style are the requirement to enter and exit from a traffic area, the inability to drive from the wheelchair and/or have the wheelchair in the <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> position, and less storage space.|$|R
50|$|The police {{officers}} who caught them testified that Boudin, feigning innocence, pleaded with them to put down their guns and convinced them to drop their guard; Boudin said she remained silent, that the officers relaxed spontaneously. After the police lowered their guns, six men armed with automatic weapons and wearing body armor emerged {{from the back of}} the truck and began firing upon the four {{police officers}}. Officer Brown was hit repeatedly by rifle rounds and collapsed on the ground. One robber then walked up to his prone body and fired several more shots into him with a 9mm handgun, ensuring his death. Keenan was shot in the leg, but managed to duck behind a tree and return fire.Officer O'Grady lived long enough to empty his revolver, but as he reloaded, he was shot several times with an M16. Ninety minutes later, he died on a hospital operating table. Meanwhile, Lennon, who was in his cruiser when the shootout began, tried to exit out the <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>door,</b> but O'Grady's body was wedged up against the door. He watched as the suspects jumped back into the U-Haul and sped directly towards him. Lennon fired his shotgun several times at the speeding truck as it collided with his police car.|$|E

50|$|Dodge {{pioneered the}} American 15-passenger van genre with the {{introduction}} of the Maxiwagon along with the other front engine B series vans that were new for 1971. Ford didn't produce a 15-passenger van until 1978, and GM did not introduce theirs until 1990. Little changed on Dodge vans produced between 1971 and 1977, with only a grille change from metal to plastic for the 1974 model year. 1978 was a transition year for B series vans, consisting of the nose from 1977 and earlier vans (with a one-year only Dodge symbol in the grille) but with a completely new dashboard and rear end cap. On the standard length vans, the rear end cap just contained new larger tail lamps, but the extended length Maxivan and Maxiwagon had a completely redesigned rear extension which was longer and had large windows that wrapped around the corners for better visibility. This was unique to the B vans, and this same extension was used until the B vans were discontinued in 2003. On the 1971-77 models, the rear side doors were set back about two feet towards the rear wheelwells, with a filler panel between them and the front doors. Passenger models had a small window between the front and rear doors. Early 1971 vans had black plastic door push buttons, an inlaid pentastar logo low right front fender, drum brakes and points type ignition. 1972 model year began a phase in of chrome door push buttons, electronic ignition, and front disc brakes. In 1978, the filler panel was removed and the doors were moved forward to be next to the <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>door,</b> similar to the Ford and Chevrolet vans.|$|E
50|$|Built for VIP use, {{the body}} by Thrupp & Maberly {{included}} a relatively luxurious interior which was split by a Perspex screen to separate driver and passengers. A <b>passenger</b> side <b>door</b> {{was provided to}} make entrance and exit easier, the two-part screen running in tracks fitted to the front seats: sliding both portions to the drivers (right) side allowed the <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> (left) seat back to be folded for an easier exit. Two Ironside specials of this kind were used by cabinet ministers {{and members of the}} royal family, while six minus the privacy screen were used as armoured staff cars.|$|R

50|$|Van {{conversions}} involve adding {{windows to}} the bodywork, and seating to the cargo area. Van conversion minibuses outwardly {{look the same}} shape as the parent van, and the driver and <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> cabin remains unchanged, retaining the driver and <b>passenger</b> <b>doors.</b> Access to the former cargo area for passengers is through the standard van side sliding door, or the rear doors. These may be fitted with step equipment to make boarding easier. Optional extras to van converted minibuses can include {{the addition of a}} rollsign for transit work, and/or a full-height walk-in <b>door,</b> for <b>passenger</b> access to the former cargo area. For public transport use, this door may be an automatic concertina type. For other uses, this may be a simple plug style coach door. Depending on the relevant legislation, conversions may also involve wheelchair lifts and tachograph equipment. A van conversion with a passenger area in the front and a storage area in the back, behind a fixed bulkhead, is called a splitter bus.|$|R
