5|$|Katherine Merry Devine, 14, was {{abducted}} on November 25, 1973, and <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> {{the next month}} in the Capitol State Forest near Olympia, Washington. Brenda Joy Baker, 14, was seen hitchhiking near Puyallup, Washington on May 27, 1974; <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> in Millersylvania State Park a month later. Though Bundy was widely believed responsible for both murders, he told Keppel {{that he had no}} knowledge of either case. DNA analysis led to the arrest and conviction of William E. Cosden for Devine's murder in 2002. The Baker homicide remains unsolved.|$|E

5|$|Most {{accounts}} {{say that}} Kanhopatra's body was laid at feet of Vithoba and then buried near {{the southern part}} of the temple, in accordance with her last wishes. In some accounts, the nearby Bhima river (Chandrabhaga) flooded, inundating the temple and killing the army that sought Kanhopatra. The next day, <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> near a rock. According to all versions of the legend, a tarati tree—which is worshipped by pilgrims in her remembrance—arose on the spot where Kanhopatra was buried. Kanhopatra is the only person whose samadhi (mausoleum) is in the precincts of the Vithoba temple.|$|E
5|$|The 20-year-old newlywed {{was last}} seen at the Sawgrass Mills Mall where she worked at a {{sporting}} goods store. When she did not return home her husband went to the mall and found her car, a 1985 Ford Tempo, with the tires slashed. It is believed that Chandler, after scoping out the victim {{over a couple of}} days, slashed the tires and showed up {{in the guise of a}} good samaritan and offered to help. Three hours after she was reported missing, <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> under a residential mailbox, in a local neighborhood, by two men returning from a fishing trip.|$|E

5|$|A {{memorial}} garden {{dedicated to}} Figard was planted at St Andrew's Church {{in the village}} of Ombersley, Worcestershire, close to where <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found,</b> and opened at a ceremony in June 1997. Local residents raised more than £1,000 to help with its construction. The garden also remembers other victims of violent crime, including Joanna Parrish and Caroline Dickinson, two English students who were murdered in France. On 29 December 2000, the fifth anniversary of the date Figard's body was recovered, the local newspaper, the Worcester News reported that an annual service of remembrance was held for her at the church during the autumn, attended by her parents. Flowers were also regularly placed at the lay-by at Hawford where she was found, and the location named Le Jardin de Céline (Celine's Garden) in her memory.|$|E
5|$|Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and Pembleton (Andre Braugher) {{continue}} their struggling {{investigation into the}} murder of 11-year-old Adena Watson. Bayliss wants to question an arabber who he maintains is the killer, but Pembleton believes that lead has already been exhausted. Pembleton instead pursues a theory posed by Felton (Daniel Baldwin) that Watson was killed one day earlier than they first believed, and rigor mortis was slowed because her body was stored in a cool place. Felton and Pembleton identify a possible suspect who lived near the murder scene, and learn his car was impounded shortly after <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found.</b> As they search impound lots for the car, the two detectives bicker {{with each other and}} Pembleton accuses Felton of racism. They eventually find the car, but uncover no evidence linking it to Watson.|$|E
5|$|In 1999 Patel was reprimanded by the General Medical Council (GMC) {{for having}} {{released}} medical details about Roger Sylvester, {{a man who}} had died in police custody. In 2002 the police dropped a criminal inquiry because Patel said the victim, Sally White, had {{died of a heart attack}} with no signs of violence, although she was reportedly found naked with bruising to her body, an injury to her head and a bite mark on her thigh. Anthony Hardy, a mentally ill alcoholic who lived in the flat in which <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> locked in a bedroom, later murdered two women and placed their body parts in bin bags. The police investigated Patel in relation to that autopsy, but the investigation was dropped.|$|E
5000|$|... "Missing Mother's Day" [...] - Tina Marie Hill was a 39-year-old {{divorced}} mother from Social Circle, Georgia who suddenly disappeared while walking to {{a convenience store}} in May 2005.

On New Years 1993, <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> <b>found</b> in <b>her</b> Chevrolet Camaro after a party in Northeast Portland. After years, her family thought the case would remain unsolved until an {{unlikely}} suspect is arrested.|$|R
5|$|On Tuesday 7 August, {{following}} a Monday bank holiday, prostitute Martha Tabram was murdered at about 2:30am. <b>Her</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> at George Yard Buildings, George Yard, Whitechapel. She had been stabbed 39times {{with a short}} blade. On the basis of statements from a fellow prostitute, and PC Thomas Barrett who was patrolling nearby, Inspector Reid put soldiers at the Tower of London and Wellington Barracks on an identification parade, but without positive results. The police did not connect the murder with Smith's, but they did connect it with the later murders. Most experts today do not connect it with the other killings, as Tabram was stabbed whereas the later victims were slashed, but a connection cannot be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|By tradition, Anna {{is said to}} {{have had}} a fourth daughter, Wihtburh, an abbess at Dereham (or {{possibly}} West Dereham), where there was a royal double monastery. She may never have existed: Bede fails to mention her and she first appears in a calendar in the late 10th century Bosworth Psalter. She may have been a character specifically created by the religious community at Ely, where her remains were supposed to have been taken after being stolen from Dereham and subsequently used as visual proof of the incorruptibility of a saint's body, a substitute for her sister Æthelthryth, whose body had to remain unexamined in her tomb. Manuscript F of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which dates from about 1100, mentions Wihtburh's death when it records that <b>her</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> uncorrupted in 798, 55 years after she died. The resulting date for her death of 743 is too far too late for her to have been a sister of Æthelthryth, who was born in 636.|$|E
5|$|The last of {{the murders}} in the Whitechapel file was {{committed}} on Friday 13 February 1891 when prostitute Frances Coles was murdered under a railway arch. <b>Her</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> by PC Ernest Thompson only moments after the attack at 2:15am at Swallow Gardens, a passageway under a railway arch between Chamber Street and Royal Mint Street, Whitechapel. Minor wounds {{on the back of}} her head suggest that she was thrown violently to the ground before her throat was cut at least twice, from left to right and then back again. Otherwise there were no mutilations to the body. Superintendent Arnold and Inspector Reid arrived soon afterwards from the nearby Leman Street police station, and Chief Inspectors Donald Swanson and Henry Moore, who had been involved in the previous murder investigations, arrived by 5am. A man named James Sadler, who had been seen with Coles earlier, was arrested by the police and charged with her murder. A high-profile investigation by Swanson and Moore into Sadler's past history and his whereabouts at the time of the previous Whitechapel murders indicates that the police may have suspected him to be the Ripper. However, Sadler was released on 3 March for lack of evidence.|$|E
