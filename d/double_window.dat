25|$|On Friday, May 3 around 8:50p.m. Virgil was {{relaxing}} {{in his chair}} {{in the sitting room}} just off of the kitchen and bedroom with a heating pad on his back.

60|$|Bellamy, King's Spy, and Dorward, journalist, {{known to}} fame in every English-speaking country, {{stood before the}} <b>double</b> <b>window</b> of their spacious sitting-room, looking down upon the {{thoroughfare}} beneath. Both men were laboring under a bitter sense of failure. Bellamy's face was dark with forebodings; Dorward was irritated and nervous. Failure was a new thing to him--a thing which those behind the great journals which he represented understood less, even, than he. Bellamy loved his country, and fear was gnawing at his heart.|$|E
60|$|She first {{looked into}} the drawing-room, but it was stale and dreary. The dining-room, which she tried next, made her hungry. The arrival of a servant with a broom {{suggested}} {{to her that she}} had better {{get out of the way}} of the household work. She felt half sorry for getting up, and went out on the lawn to recover her spirits. There she heard a man's voice trolling a stave somewhere in the direction of the laboratory. Thinking that it might be Lord Carbury, and that, if so, he would probably not wait until half past nine to break his fast, she ran gaily off round the southwest corner of the Cottage to a terrace, from which there was access through a great <b>double</b> <b>window,</b> now wide open, to a lofty apartment roofed with glass.|$|E

40|$|In {{selecting}} <b>double</b> <b>windows</b> for {{a particular}} application it is most desirable to have information regarding their inside surface temperature characteristics. The choice of windows {{may be influenced by}} the inside relative humidity conditions desired or anticipated and the amount of condensation that can be tolerated. The thermal limitations of <b>double</b> <b>windows</b> must be recognized in establishing building humidity. For some applications and window constructions it is necessary to determine the surface temperature characteristics by individual tests. For general-purpose rating for thermal performance the test conditions must be standardized, particularly the surrounding construction and the surface heat exchange conditions.
