40|$|Abstract: Drives of {{machines}} {{which are used}} now do not possess ability to be adapted for extreme working conditions. Such conditions are connected with possible difficulties of motion because of deviations from operation norms (for example, because of long inactivity, deterioration of conditions of lubricant, minor damages, a temperature difference, etc.). In the conditions of impossibility of elimination of minor failures on the move (for example in aeronautical engineering) insignificant discrepancy of operation of service mechanism {{can serve as a}} cause of accident. Recently the technological direction of use of adaptive <b>drive</b> <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> is advanced. The adaptive drive mechanism contains the engine and the self-regulated transmission mechanism. The adaptive gear transmission mechanism with two degrees of freedom has ability to actuate an executive end-effector with a speed inversely to external load at constant engine power. It means that even in presence of handicap in motion of end-effector the drive mechanism breakage will not occur. The adaptive vibratory mechanism {{in the form of the}} closed gear differential with unbalanced masses can procure effective vibratory action on the end-effector. Such vibratory mechanism will procure the reliable overcoming of operational overloads. In offered work the describing of the vibratory mechanism with unbalance...|$|E
