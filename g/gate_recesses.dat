40|$|The {{development}} of a new semiconductor device is a process which often involves an iterative cycle of design, fabrication, and re-design, until the desired specification is reached. Physical modelling of semiconductor devices is being used to a greater and greater extent to reduce the time spent in the design process, by allowing the engineer to rapidly determine the effect of the changes he may make to a device upon the device's final performance. The diverse nature of the geometries used in modern devices, even those in the same class, makes it almost essential that a modelling scheme be used which is capable of adapting, with the minimum of change to the software, to the geometry of the device to be modelled. The current work is concerned with the {{development of}} such a model. The software uses the techniques of automatic finite-difference grid generation, and adaptive refinement, to enable it to be used, without modification, on almost any device geometry. The software has been used to simulate a variety of GaAs MESFET's, with and without <b>gate</b> <b>recesses</b> and surface charge effects. The results of the simulation of both a planar and a recessed gate 1. 0 /im gate length device is presented. It will be seen that near pinch-off {{a large proportion of the}} current between the source and the drain of the device is flowing deep within the substrate, a phenomenon which greatly increases the calculated pinch-off voltage above that predicted by simple one-dimensional calculations, and results in an increase in calculated drain conductance, compared with experimental devices. 529 1...|$|E

This graduation work focused on finding how one could standardize {{one part of the}} navigation locks, namely the lock gate. Besides, finding an innovative idea for the lock gate was also part of the agenda. This resulted in the design of a concrete modular rolling arc gate. The modular part as a means of standardizing the gate, by making it possible to install the gate at many different sites; the concrete and arc gate parts are the parts where innovation is applied. The most difficult part was to support the gate in the <b>gate</b> <b>recesses</b> {{in such a way that}} bending stresses were reduced to a minimum (creating an arch-like structure) without any extra mechanisms, to keep the gate light and thin. This was done by clamping the gate in the recess, which resulted in some contradicting demands. On the one hand, the gate needed to be flexible, so that it would bend enough to clamp in the recess, hence, a thin gate was required. On the other hand, the gate needed to be strong enough to bear the loads, hence, the gate needed to be thicker. The lock gate could not be as thin as required to reach the supports through bending and this concept was concluded technically unfeasible. It is however recommended to investigate the costs and benefits of a concrete modular gate design because this resulted in a relatively easy to build and maintain design (given that the supports had not been a problem).

40|$|Conference on Noise in Devices and Circuits III, Austin, U. S. A., May 2005 We report {{systematic}} investigations on hot-electron degradation in GaN-based HEMTs {{with different}} gate recess depths, d r, fabricated by reactive ion etching. The experimental data stipulate two different mechanisms underlying the hot-electron degradations of the devices. During the initial phase of hot-electron injection significant changes {{were observed in}} the dc characteristics of the devices and the flicker noise power spectral density, SV(f). The degradations were partially recovered by annealing the devices at 100 °C for 20 minutes. It is shown that for stress time ts≤ 25 hours the reverse bias gate current, IG, decreases systematically with ts, whereas SV(f) fluctuates randomly. Detailed analyses of SV(f) measured {{over a wide range}} temperatures show that the initial degradations originate from the percolation of carriers in the 2 DEG. The significant increase in the flicker noise during the initial phase of high-voltage stress is due to the generation of H+ at the AlGaN/GaN interface. The fluctuations in the magnitudes of SV(f) for ts≤ 25 hours originate from the motion of the H+ {{in the direction of the}} electric field. This results in the modulation of the percolation path leading to significant variations in SV(f) as a function of ts. For ts> 25 hours both IG and SV(f) are stabilized resulting from the drifting of the H+ away from the gate region. Further stressing beyond 25 hours indicate strong dependencies of the device lifetimes on dr suggesting significant material degradation due to the reactive ion etching process for the fabrication of the <b>gate</b> <b>recesses.</b> Detailed characterization of the noise show that the final irreversible degradation is due to the generation of traps at the AlGaN/GaN interface.
