One tale tells of Krishnacharya's disciples, two Mahasiddha ("great perfected ones") sisters, Mekhala and Kanakhala, who cut their heads, offered them to their guru, and then danced.

5|$|Half of Minneapolis–Saint Paul {{residents}} work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>where</b> they live.

He followed that season up by scoring 32 points and recording 245 PIM in 1999–2000 in a season split between Sudbury and the Mississauga IceDogs.|$|E
5|$|Petrosino {{received}} anonymous {{letters from}} Neapolitans in New York that confirmed Alfano's presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> <b>where</b> he allegedly {{had given a}} banquet to several local Camorra members in a Grand Street restaurant. On April 17, 1907, Petrosino and his agents raided the apartment at 108 Mulberry Street where Alfano was living and arrested him. The arrest caused a sensation in Naples. He {{had been convicted of}} a crime involving moral turpitude in Italy and was turned over to the Federal authorities. Within three days he was expelled and put on a ship to Le Havre in France, where he was picked up by the Italian police. He was put behind bars in Naples. According to some sources, Alfano was the man behind Petrosino's murder in Palermo on March 12, 1909, which has since been attributed to the Sicilian Mafia, and to Vito Cascioferro in particular.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardinals}} {{began the}} election by meeting and voting {{once a day}} in the Episcopal Palace in Viterbo, before returning to their respective residences; tradition dictated that the election should take place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>where</b> the previous pope died, if the late pontiff had died outside Rome. There is little reliable data about the candidates proposed during almost three years of deliberations; certainly cardinals Odo of Châteauroux, John of Toledo, Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, Ottaviano Ubaldini, Riccardo Annibadi and Ottobono Fieschi were counted among papabili. According to later accounts, not supported by the contemporary sources, after two months, the cardinals nearly elected Philip Benizi, general of the Servite Order, who had come to Viterbo to admonish the cardinals, but fled to prevent his election. Also the candidature of Saint Bonaventure had allegedly been proposed. Modern scholars treat these accounts with scepticism, considering them as products of invention of the hagiographers of these two saints. Charles of Anjou was in Viterbo for the entirety of the election; Philip III of France visited the city in March 1271.|$|E

5|$|The new cruiser {{was laid}} down in 1907 at the Ansaldo {{shipyard}} in Genoa for the Ottoman Empire, under the name Drama. But following {{the rise of the}} Young Turks in the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman government became unwilling to pay its foreign debts, which led Ansaldo to halt construction work. Work on the ship only resumed in late 1911 when Italy seized the ship following its declaration of war against the Ottoman Empire in the Italo-Turkish War. The completed hull was launched on 11 November 1912, and following the completion of fitting-out work, the new ship was commissioned on 25 March 1913. On 3 September 1914, Libia was in the port of Durazzo, Albania when Prince William, the ruler of the country, departed following turmoil caused by an insurgency in the country, coupled with the outbreak of World War I. Libia had landed a contingent of marines to restore order <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> <b>where</b> some 2,000 refugees fleeing the insurgents attempted to board passenger ships bound for Italy.
