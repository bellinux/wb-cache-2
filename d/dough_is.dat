25|$|The {{ingredients}} to make dried pasta usually include water and semolina flour; egg for colour and richness (in {{some types of}} pasta), and possibly vegetable juice (such as spinach, beet, tomato, carrot), herbs or spices for colour and flavour. After mixing semolina flour with warm water the <b>dough</b> <b>is</b> kneaded mechanically until it becomes firm and dry. If pasta is to be flavoured, eggs, vegetable juices, and herbs are added at this stage. The <b>dough</b> <b>is</b> then passed into the laminator to be flattened into sheets, then compressed by a vacuum mixer-machine to clear out air bubbles and excess water from the dough until the moisture content is reduced to 12%. Next, the <b>dough</b> <b>is</b> processed in a steamer to kill any bacteria it may contain.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of Bamboo shoot dietary fiber (BSDF) on the {{mechanical}} properties, moisture distribution, and microstructure of frozen <b>dough</b> <b>were</b> investigated. The state and distribution of water in frozen <b>dough</b> <b>was</b> determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LNMR) spectroscopy. The microstructure of frozen <b>dough</b> <b>was</b> studied. The structure of the gluten protein network found in wheat flour <b>dough</b> <b>was</b> studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The result showed that the BSDF could significantly improve the viscoelasticity and extensibility of frozen dough after thawing in a dose-dependent manner. It was significantly improved {{with the increase in}} the addition amount of BSDF (P< 0. 05). DSC analysis showed that the freezable water content and thermal stability of frozen <b>dough</b> <b>were</b> increased after the addition of BSDF. LNMR analysis showed that the appropriate (< 0. 1 %) addition amount of BSDF could significantly (P< 0. 05) decline the contents of bound water.

From ancient times, pills were formed by combining several herbs and other ingredients, which were dried and ground into a powder. They were then mixed with a binder and formed into pills by hand. The binder was traditionally honey. Modern teapills, however, are extracted in stainless steel extractors to create either a water decoction or water-alcohol decoction, depending on the herbs used. They are extracted at a low temperature (below 100 degrees Celsius) to preserve essential ingredients. The extracted liquid is then further condensed, and some raw herb powder from one of the herbal ingredients is mixed in to form an herbal dough. This <b>dough</b> <b>is</b> then machine cut into tiny pieces, a small amount of excipients are added for a smooth and consistent exterior, and they are spun into pills.

40|$|The use of {{freezing}} {{technology is}} well established in industrial and craft bakeries and is still gaining importance.

In this study, frozen wheat bread <b>dough</b> <b>was</b> investigated by confocal Raman microscopy. The Raman spectra measured within the <b>dough</b> <b>were</b> compared with spectra of the main components of frozen dough, i. e. ice, liquid water, starch, gluten and yeast. In this way, the spatial distribution of the single components within the <b>dough</b> <b>was</b> determined and corresponding images of the frozen <b>dough</b> microstructure <b>were</b> generated. On these images, ice appears as a continuous network rather than as isolated crystals.
