Based on stomach {{content analysis of}} over 19,500 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the North Pacific from 1952 to 1971, 64.1% contained only krill, 25.5% copepods, 5.0% fish, 3.4% krill and copepods and 1.7% squid. Nemoto (1959) analysed the stomach contents of about 7500 fin whales caught in the northern North Pacific and Bering Sea from 1952 to 1958, found that they mainly preyed on euphausiids around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska and schooling fish in the northern Bering Sea and off Kamchatka. In the northern Bering Sea (north of 58°N), their main prey species were capelin (Mallotus villosus), Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii); they also consumed saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis). Arctic krill (Thysanoessa raschii) was the only species of euphausiid found in the stomachs of fin whales in the northern Bering Sea. Off Kamchatka, they appeared to primarily feed on herring. They also took large quantities of the copepod Neocalanus cristatus around the Aleutian Islands and in Olyutorsky Bay off northeast Kamchatka, areas where the species was abundant. Five species of euphausiid (Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa spinifera, T. inermis, T. raschii, and T. longipes) were the predominant prey around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska. Prey varied by region in the Kuril Islands area, with euphausiids (T. longipes, T. inermis, and T. raschii) and copepods (Neocalanus plumchrus and N. cristatus) being the main prey in the northern area and <b>Japanese</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squid</b> (Todarodes pacificus pacificus) and small schooling fish (e.g. Pacific saury, Cololabis saira; and Japanese anchovy, Engraulis japonicus) dominating the diet in the southern area.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squid,</b> Todarodes pacificus, {{is thought}} to spawn {{neutrally}} buoyant egg masses that retain a specific location {{in the water column}} by floating at the interface between water layers of slightly different densities. It is important to understand the physical process that determines the vertical distribution of the egg masses to predict their horizontal drift in relation to embryo survival and subsequent recruitment. Here, mesocosm experiments were conducted in a 300 m 3 tank by creating a thermally stratified (17 - 22 °C) water column to obtain egg masses. A cage net methodology was developed to sustain egg masses for detailed observation. We measured the density of the egg masses of T. pacificus, and used this information to infer the vertical distribution patterns of the egg masses at the spawning grounds (Tsushima Strait, Japan). When measured separately, the density of the outer jelly of each egg mass was 2. 7 σ units higher than that of the surrounding water. The outer jelly and the specific gravity of embedded individual eggs (~ 1. 10) cause the egg masses to have very slight negative buoyancy relative to the water in which they are formed. Analysis of the vertical profile of the spawning ground showed that water density (σθ) increased sharply at ~ 30 m depth; thus, egg masses might settle above the pycnocline layer. In conclusion, we suggest that T. pacificus egg masses might retain their location in the water column by floating at the interface between water layers of slightly different densities, which happen to be above the pycnocline layer (actual depth varies seasonally/annually) in the Tsushima Strait between Korea and Japan...|$|E
40|$|Human SEC 14 L 1 shows partial {{sequence}} homology to the budding yeast SEC 14 protein and the <b>Japanese</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squid</b> retinal-binding protein and was previously generally localized to 17 q 25. We more precisely mapped SEC 14 L 1 within a discrete region of 17 q 25 that likely harbors {{at least one}} putative breast and ovarian tumor suppressor gene. We determined that this gene consists of 18 exons {{ranging in size from}} 70 bp (exon 11) to 3088 bp (exon 17) and spanning at least 58 kb of DNA. Exon 17 contained a highly polymorphic variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and was present only in the larger ubiquitously expressed 5. 5 -kb transcript. The 3. 0 -kb ubiquitously expressed transcript included sequences at the beginning of exon 17 (designated exon 17 a) and the end of exon 17 (designated exon 18), but lacked the internal 2439 bp of exon 17, including the VNTR. This alternative splicing resulted in a predicted protein of 719 residues from the smaller transcript with four more terminal amino acids than the 715 residue protein predicted from the larger transcript. EST H 49244 spanned exon 11 of SEC 14 L 1 and was specifically expressed in human peripheral blood leukocytes. One intragenic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was confirmed. SEC 14 L 1 contained the CRAL/TRIO domain also found in alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (TTPA) and cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP). As retinoids have been shown to inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells, loss of the proposed SEC 14 L 1 retinal-binding function may contribute to breast tumorigenesis. As TTPA and CRALBP have been implicated in retinitis pigmentosa (RP), altered SEC 14 L 1 expression may contribute to RP in previously unlinked families.
