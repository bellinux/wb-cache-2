People widely believe in witchcraft, and the government outlaws such practices. Suspected witches are often subject to mob violence.

Beforehand however, Khaldun removes all the surveillance equipment on him. Furthermore, news of Khaldun's arrival also gains the interest of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who also wish to use him.|$|E

On June 13, a Twitter account, @wikibaghdadi, claimed a [...] "Meeting between ISIS and Naqshbandi Army near al-Qayara area south of Mosul had taken place with representatives from Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi." [...] In July 2014, al-Douri issued an audio recording praising [...] "the heroes and knights of al Qaeda and the Islamic State" [...] forces in attacking Iraqi government positions within Saladin, Kirkuk, Diyala and Nineveh province. His connections with Islamist elements in Iraq is said to have emerged as far back as during Saddam's regime. According to the Soufan Group, al-Douri had close ties with senior ISIS officials Abu Muslim al-Turkmani and Abu Ayman al-Iraqi. Both men had served in the Ba'athist regime under Saddam Hussein, with al-Turkmani being a Lieutenant colonel and serving in the Istikhbarat and Special Republican Guard. Al-Iraqi had been a Colonel in Iraq's Air Defense Intelligence.|$|E
2500|$|Another mass {{execution}} {{was discovered}} near the eastern city of Deir ez-Zor. The unidentified corpses of 13 {{men had been}} discovered shot to death execution-style. This incident raised awareness that the violence in Syria was heading towards an inexorable vicious cycle of tit-for-tat attacks between the different parties involved. According to the opposition, the 13 people who were shot at point blank range and later found in a field were employees at the electricity company in Deir Ezzor, who went on strike in protest of the massacres committed by the Syrian regime. They all had their hands tied behind their backs and were {{shot in the head}} according to a UN report. The head of a UN observer mission in Syria was “deeply disturbed” by the killings in Deir Ezzor, calling it an “appalling and inexcusable act.” Several days later, the dead were identified to be military and the opposition than claimed they were army defectors killed by government forces. However, on 5 June, the <b>jihadist</b> <b>group</b> the Al-Nusra Front to Protect the Levant claimed responsibility for the killings, stating that they had captured and interrogated the soldiers in Deir al-Zor and [...] "justly" [...] punished them with death, after they confessed to crimes.|$|E

On January 22, Cristina Fernández announced the government-sponsored programme [...] "Progresar", which gives a monthly subsidy for youths aged 18 to 24 who wish to complete studies but are unemployed or work under the table. Cristina Kirchner visited Pope Francis for a third time. The scandal over Amado Boudou grew when he was summoned for inquiry by Federal Judge Ariel Lijo. The country paid the debt with the Paris Club. US judge Thomas P. Griesa rules that Argentina must pay as well to the hedge funds that did not enter into the Argentine debt restructuring, which Argentina failed to do. Still, the government denies that such failure may be a new sovereign default; Standard & Poor’s defined it as a [...] "selective default". She said in a speech at the United Nations that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant <b>jihadist</b> <b>group</b> may be trying to kill her, and later that it would be the US; Elisa Carrió dismissed such threats as mere conspiracy theories. In her speech, she accused the [...] "vulture funds" [...] of destabilizing the economy of the countries and called them [...] "economic terrorists". The government promoted several new laws and law amendments, such as an overhauled civil code, hydrocarbon law and telecommunications law. Cristina Kirchner was denounced in the Hotesur scandal over a firm headed by her and her sons to manage the hotels in Calafate. She is suspected of using the hotels for money laundering.
