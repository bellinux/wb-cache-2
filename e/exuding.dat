40|$|Zinc and {{phosphorus}} are essential nutrients with low bioavailability in calcareous soils. Some plants <b>exude</b> organic acids {{to increase the}} solubility of these two nutrients. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine citrate exudation rates of different lupin (Feodora and Energy) and rapeseed (Dunkeld, Yickadee and Rainbow) cultivars underdeficiencies of Zn and P. The plants were cultivated into three different nutrient solutions (complete, -Zn, and -P) with pH around 7. Under Zn deficiency, rapeseed cultivars lost about 80 % of its shoot fresh weight, but the roots did not <b>exude</b> any organic acids such as citrate, malate or oxalate. Both lupin and rapeseed cultivars <b>exuded</b> citrate only under phosphorus deficiency. The exudation rates of Feodora and Energy were 3. 89 μmol g- 1 RDW h- 1 and 3. 45 μmol g- 1 RDW h- 1, respectively, while that of Dunkeld was 15. 1 μmol g- 1 RDW h- 1. The results indicated that lupin and rapeseed lost their production under Zn deficiency but they did not <b>exude</b> organic acid, while under P deficiency both plants <b>exuded</b> citrate...|$|R

5|$|Lemon ants make devil's gardens {{by killing}} {{surrounding}} plants with their stings and leaving a pure patch of lemon ant trees, (Duroia hirsuta). This {{modification of the}} forest provides the ants with more nesting sites inside the stems of the Duroia trees. Although some ants obtain nectar from flowers, pollination by ants is somewhat rare. Some plants have special nectar <b>exuding</b> structures, extrafloral nectaries, that provide food for ants, which in turn protect the plant from more damaging herbivorous insects. Species such as the bullhorn acacia (Acacia cornigera) in Central America have hollow thorns that house colonies of stinging ants (Pseudomyrmex ferruginea) who defend the tree against insects, browsing mammals, and epiphytic vines. Isotopic labelling studies suggest that plants also obtain nitrogen from the ants.N labelling study of nitrogen fluxes from ants to plants in the mutualism of Pheidole and Piper|vauthors=Fischer RC, Wanek W, Richter A, Mayer V |year=2003|journal=Journal of Ecology|volume=91|pages=126–134|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2745.2003.00747.x }} In return, the ants obtain food from protein- and lipid-rich Beltian bodies. In Fiji Philidris nagasau (Dolichoderinae) are known to selectively grow species of epiphytic Squamellaria (Rubiaceae) which produce large domatia inside which the ant colonies nest. The ants plant the seeds and the domatia of young seedling are immediately occupied and the ant faeces in them contribute to rapid growth. Similar dispersal associations are found with other dolichoderines {{in the region as}} well. Another example of this type of ectosymbiosis comes from the Macaranga tree, which has stems adapted to house colonies of Crematogaster ants.|$|E

25|$|As the {{community}} grew in wealth and population and rose in socioeconomic status, Koreans expanded their presence eastward along Northern Boulevard, buying homes in more affluent and less crowded Queens neighborhoods {{and more recently}} into adjacent suburban Nassau County, bringing their businesses with them, and thereby expanding the Koreatown itself. This expansion {{has led to the}} creation of an American Meokjagolmok, or Korean Restaurant Street, around the Long Island Rail Road station in Murray Hill, Queens, <b>exuding</b> the ambience of Seoul itself. The eastward pressure to expand was also created by the inability to move westward, inhibited by the formidable presence of the enormous Flushing Chinatown (法拉盛華埠) centered on Main Street.|$|E
25|$|The plum blossom, {{which is}} known as the meihua (梅花), {{is one of the most}} beloved flowers in China and has been {{frequently}} depicted in Chinese art and poetry for centuries. The plum blossom is seen as a symbol of winter and a harbinger of spring. The blossoms are so beloved because they are viewed as blooming most vibrantly amidst the winter snow, <b>exuding</b> an ethereal elegance, while their fragrance is noticed to still subtly pervade the air at even the coldest times of the year. Therefore, the plum blossom came to symbolize perseverance and hope, as well as beauty, purity, and the transitoriness of life. In Confucianism, the plum blossom stands for the principles and values of virtue. More recently, it has also been used as a metaphor to symbolize revolutionary struggle since the turn of the 20th century.|$|E
