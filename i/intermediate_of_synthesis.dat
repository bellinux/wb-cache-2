The {{first part of}} dissertation work was focus on the preparation and characterization of recoverable catalysts for a Henry reaction. First have been prepared and characterized catalysts based on a Cu(II) complexes of block copolymer ?ż-methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) -b-poly(L-glutamic acid) with (2 R, 5 S) - or (2 S, 5 S) - 5 -isopropyl- 5 -methyl- 2 -(pyridine- 2 -yl) - imidazolidine- 4 -one. The reaction of substituted aldehydes with nitromethane catalyzed by these prepared semi-soluble catalysts gives corresponding 2 -nitroalcohols with high chemical yields (70. 98 %) and high enantioselectivity (61. 92 % ee). The polymer catalyst can be easily isolated from the reaction mixture by adding diethyl ether, catalyst was precipitate, recycled by centrifugation, and reused up to 10 cycles. Next have been prepared and characterized recoverable catalyst based on Cu(II) complex of magnetic nanoparticles Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 with (2 R, 5 S) - 5 -isopropyl- 5 -methyl- 2 -(pyridine- 2 -yl) imidazolidine- 4 -one ligand. The prepared catalyst was characterized using DLS, FT-IR spectroscopy, SEM, and microanalysis. The reaction of substituted aldehydes with nitromethane catalyzed by this heterogeneous catalyst gives corresponding 2 -nitroalcohols with high chemical yields (88. 92 %) and high enantioselectivity (68. 94 % ee). The reaction rate decreased due {{to the formation of}} aggregated form of catalyst nanoparticles whose size (115. 834 nm) depends up on their content in the reaction medium. The MNPs supported catalyst can be easily isolated from the reaction mixture by external magnetic field and reused up to 10 cycles. After a tenfold recycling of the catalyst, the catalytic activity slightly decreases (  10 %); however, no change in enantioselectivity was observed (  94 % ee). The efficiency of the catalyst was also verified in the preparation of an <b>intermediate</b> <b>of</b> <b>synthesis</b> of the medical drug (R) -Salmeterol (72 %, 91 % ee). The second part of dissertation work was oriented to preparation and characterization conjugate of isoniazid with magnetic nanoparticles Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 (189 ?} 3 nm) as a drug delivery system. The molecules of isoniazid were attached to the surface of nanoparticles by a covalent pH-sensitive imine bond. The conjugate was characterized by X-ray diffraction, SEM, dynamic light scattering, IR spectroscopy and microanalysis. The conjugate released isoniazid under in vitro conditions (pH = 4; 37 ??C; t.. 115 s). In addition, the cytotoxicity of the Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 -isoniazid was evaluated in SK-BR- 3 cell using the xCELLigence system. Fakulta chemicko-technologick...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{analyze the}} {{antiviral}} mechanism of Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) against hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. METHODS: In this research, the HBV-replicating cell line HepG 2. 117 {{was used to}} investigate the antiviral mechanism of EGCG. Cytotoxicity of EGCG was analyzed by 3 -(4, 5 -Dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Hepatitis B virus e antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) in the supernatant were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Precore mRNA and pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) levels were determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The effect of EGCG on HBV core promoter activity was measured by dual luciferase reporter assay. HBV covalently closed circular DNA and replicative <b>intermediates</b> <b>of</b> DNA were quantified by real-time PCR assay. RESULTS: When HepG 2. 117 cells were grown {{in the presence of}} EGCG, the expression of HBeAg was suppressed, however, the expression of HBsAg was not affected. HBV precore mRNA level was also down-regulated by EGCG, while the transcription of precore mRNA was not impaired. The <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> both HBV covalently closed circular DNA and replicative <b>intermediates</b> <b>of</b> DNA were reduced by EGCG treatment to a similar extent, however, HBV pgRNA transcripted from chromosome-integrated HBV genome was not affected by EGCG treatment, indicating that EGCG targets only replicative <b>intermediates</b> <b>of</b> DNA <b>synthesis.</b> CONCLUSION: In HepG 2. 117 cells, EGCG inhibits HBV replication by impairing HBV replicative <b>intermediates</b> <b>of</b> DNA <b>synthesis</b> and such inhibition results in reduced production of HBV covalently closed circular DNA...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> {{a series of}} new 5 -substituted- 1 -(2 -hydroxybenzoyl) -benzotriazoles, which have been tested for their {{activity}} as possible activators of potassium channels. In rat aortic rings, the Opened' derivatives 1 a-f, <b>intermediates</b> <b>of</b> <b>synthesis,</b> showed vasorelaxing properties, with appreciable values of potency. However, the most remarkable effects were recorded for the 2 -hydroxybenzoylbenzotriazoles 3 a-f, which showed full vasorelaxing efficacy and high potency values. The introduction of a 2 -hydroxybenzyl substituent in the 1 position of the benzotriazole ring (compound 7) strongly decreased the activity, showing {{the importance of the}} electron-acceptor carbonyl function. The best compound, 3 b, was further investigated, in order to evaluate the possible mechanism of action involved in the vasodilator activity. In the vascular model, different potassium channel blockers inhibited the effects of the compound, and an increase of the levels of membrane depolarisation induced a significant reduction of the recorded responses. Compound 3 b was also tested in a model of isolated rat heart, retroperfused through the aorta and submitted to a global ischemia/reperfusion cycle. In such an experimental condition, 3 b showed an interesting cardioprotective activity. All the above observations are in agreement with the hypothesis of a mechanism linked to the activation of potassium channels...|$|R
