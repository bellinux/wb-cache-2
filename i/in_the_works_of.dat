5|$|The Hurva Synagogue, as {{an emblem}} of Jerusalem and its Jewish heritage, has been portrayed {{over the years in}} {{numerous}} paintings, and referred to in literature and culture. The synagogue was portrayed, for example, in works by artists Yossef Gaiger, Jonathan Kis-Lev, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Holocaust survivor, artist Motke Blum.

5|$|Although The Raft of the Medusa retains {{elements}} of the traditions of history painting, in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, it represents {{a break from the}} calm and order of the prevailing Neoclassical school. Géricault's work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The Louvre acquired it soon after the artist's death at the age of 32. The painting's influence can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Eugène Delacroix, J. M. W. Turner, Gustave Courbet, and Édouard Manet.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the ontological}} {{argument}} {{may have been}} implicit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Greek philosophers such as Plato and the Neoplatonists, the mainstream {{view is that the}} ontological argument was first clearly stated and developed by Anselm of Canterbury. Some scholars argued that the Islamic philosopher Avicenna (Ibn Sina) developed a special kind of ontological argument before Anselm, but other scholars have doubted this position. Daniel Dombrowski marked three major stages {{in the development of the}} argument: Anselm's initial explicit formulation; the eighteenth century criticisms of Kant and Hume; and the identification of a second ontological argument in Anselm's Proslogion by twentieth century philosophers.|$|E
5|$|An {{articulate}} {{expression of}} Greek republicanism {{can be found}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> the revolutionary author Rigas Feraios. Feraios' execution in 1798 {{at the hands of}} the Ottomans gave an aura of heroism to these political ideas, which also visualized the liberation of Greece in the context of political reforms. In addition to Feraios' writings, other works in the same polemical style took on a sharper revolutionary character, as social contradictions in the Ottoman Empire grew.|$|E

25|$|Gems were a {{favourite}} {{topic for}} antiquaries from the Renaissance onwards, culminating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Philipp von Stosch, described above. Major progress in understanding Greek gems was made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Adolf Furtwängler (1853–1907, {{father of the}} conductor, Wilhelm). Among recent scholars Sir John Boardman (b. 1927) has made a special contribution, again concentrating on Greek gems.|$|R

5|$|An early {{structural}} {{application of}} the Pythagorean tiling appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Leonardo da Vinci, who considered it among several other potential patterns for floor joists. This tiling has also long been used decoratively, for floor tiles or other similar patterns, {{as can be seen}} for instance in Jacob Ochtervelt's painting Street Musicians at the Doorway of a House (1665). It has been suggested that seeing a similar tiling in the palace of Polycrates may have provided Pythagoras with the original inspiration for his theorem.|$|E
5|$|Aqua regia, {{a mixture}} {{consisting}} of hydrochloric and nitric acids, prepared by dissolving sal ammoniac in nitric acid, was described <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Pseudo-Geber, a 13th-century European alchemist.

Sophisticated mechanisms for the economic and political development of the involved African areas were in place before Islam further strengthened trade, towns and government in western Africa. The capital, court and trade of the region find mention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> scholar Abū 'Ubayd 'Abd Allāh al-Bakrī; the mainstay of the trans Saharan trade was gold and salt.|$|E

5|$|In Norse mythology, Gefjon (alternatively spelled Gefion or Gefjun) is {{a goddess}} {{associated}} with ploughing, the Danish island of Zealand, the legendary Swedish king Gylfi, the legendary Danish king Skjöldr, foreknowledge, and virginity.

5|$|Most of the {{characters}} in Carmen—the soldiers, the smugglers, the Gypsy women and the secondary leads Micaëla and Escamillo—are reasonably familiar types within the opéra comique tradition, although drawing them from proletarian life was unusual. The two principals, José and Carmen, lie outside the genre. While each is presented quite differently from Mérimée's portrayals of a murderous brigand and a treacherous, amoral schemer, even in their relatively sanitised forms neither corresponds to the norms of opéra comique. They are more akin to the verismo style that would find fuller expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Puccini.|$|E
