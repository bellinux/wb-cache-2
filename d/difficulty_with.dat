5|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} following acute carbon monoxide poisoning is the severe delayed neurological manifestations that may occur.

Depression may occur in {{those who did not}} have pre-existing depression. These delayed neurological sequelae may occur in up to 50% of poisoned people after 2 to 40 days. It is difficult to predict who will develop delayed sequelae; however, advanced age, loss of consciousness while poisoned, and initial neurological abnormalities may increase the chance of developing delayed symptoms.|$|E
