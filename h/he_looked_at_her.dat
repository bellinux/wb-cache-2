[...] The original cover painting by Alberto Vargas {{was one of}} his last works, created at the age of 84. According to The New York Daily News, Peters [...] "persuaded him to do one last 'Vargas Girls' portrait... She just went to his California retreat, asked him to do one more, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and said, 'You ARE a Vargas girl!'" [...] She kept the original painting.

2500|$|... "It was {{inevitable}} that Bernhardt, the famous actress, and Damala, the equally notorious bon-viveur, should eventually meet. Each knew {{the reputation of the}} other and their reputation was only the more whetted thereby (...) Bernhardt prided on her ability to conquer men, to reduce them to the level of slaves; Damala vaunted his ability as a hunter and a spoiler of women (...) Their two natures were inevitably attracted towards each other (...) Damala boasted to his friends that, as soon as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> the great Sarah Bernhardt would be counted in his long list of victims; and Bernhardt was no less certain that she had only to command for Damala to succumb".|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> coldly. Worse, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{as if she}} {{had been}} an utter stranger. Bulging with her meat and drink, he cut her dead; and, having done so, turned and walked into the next flat.|$|E
60|$|MARCHBANKS. Yes. (<b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{pleading}} for credence, and then adds, simply) That {{was what was}} the matter with my collar.|$|R
6000|$|STEVE. 'It was dense of {{me not to}} {{understand}} sooner--very dense.' <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with wistful eyes. 'Must I marry you, Miss Grey?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... [He is aghast. He {{releases}} the AMAH. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with [...] horror. DAISY covers {{her face with}} her hands. The AMAH gives a [...] little snigger.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> very tendrilly. I may say, it's {{from him}} that I coppied MY look to Miss ----. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> very tendrilly {{and held out}} his arms. She gev a suffycating shreek, and rusht into his umbraces.|$|E
6000|$|... "Big Jim's" [...] wife {{gave her}} order. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with respect. She had {{mentioned}} truffles; {{and he had}} not known that she knew what truffles were. From the wine list she designated an appropriate and desirable brand. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with some admiration.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with slow-growing, uncomprehending surprise.|$|E
60|$|Her eyes sparkled as {{she felt}} the apportioned pull of the mouths of the beautiful, live things; and <b>he,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> sparkled with her in her delight.|$|R
50|$|When {{a female}} timpanist starts <b>her</b> part, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> enviously <b>at</b> <b>her</b> and mutters every time <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> back <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> “Displeasure <b>at</b> being overshadowed by a bigger drum,” the {{director}} {{comments on the}} commentary.|$|R
6000|$|MARMADUKE [...] Where is she--holla! [...] [Calling to the Beggar, who returns; <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> stedfastly.] [...] You are Idonea's Mother?-- [...] Nay, be not terrified--it does me good [...] To {{look upon}} you.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> uncomprehendingly, {{seemingly}} {{failing to}} recognize her.|$|E
60|$|Helena began {{suddenly}} to laugh. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> inquiringly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> fixedly. She {{returned}} his glance audaciously, steadfastly.|$|E
6000|$|BUILDER. They {{why do you}} say so? [About {{to mutter}} [...] "She's an idiot!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{blushing}} face and panting figure, pats her on the shoulder and says] Never mind; don't be nervous.|$|R
6000|$|MURRAY (follows Miss Gilpin {{into the}} room. She {{leads him to}} the far end of the room near the door to the hall, after {{shutting}} the porch door carefully behind him. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> defiantly). Well? ...|$|R
60|$|RICHARD (quickly {{slipping}} {{down from the}} table with instinctive good manners). Your servant, madam: no offence. (<b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> earnestly.) You deserve your reputation; but I'm sorry to see by your expression that you're a good woman.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with an artist's sudden, critical, {{estimating}} eye.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{and smiled}} in {{recognition}} of her subterfuge.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> thoughtfully for a moment, and {{his eyes}} twinkled.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no; it's {{not merely}} that he's sorry. By the way <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> I know I'm not mistaken. I've wondered--what do you think, Leila. He's {{too old for}} her; but he seems an honourable, kind man." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> very grieved, {{then turns}} and marches out, [...] {{followed}} by LADY DEDMOND, whose voice is heard without, answered [...] by his: [...] "What!" [...] In the doorway, as they pass, GEORGE is [...] standing; he comes in.|$|R
6000|$|TOUCHIT.--Stop! I say, Julia! [She returns, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{takes her}} hand.] Why do you dress {{yourself}} in this odd poky way? You {{used to be}} a very smartly dressed girl. Why do you hide your hair, and wear such a dowdy, high gown, Julia? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> whimsically, {{and wiped}} the tears from his eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> and {{his eyes}} were angry under knitted brows.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{and made}} a slight, sad gesture, {{indifferent}} also.|$|E
60|$|So! Anger, and fear, and shame. All three contending. What power {{this woman}} has to keep these raging passions down! Mr. Tulkinghorn's {{thoughts}} take such form as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> with his ragged grey eyebrows a hair's breadth more contracted than usual under her gaze.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> stood <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{with a kind}} {{of desperate}} irresolution.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> steadfastly, {{scarcely}} heeding {{what she}} said.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> clearly {{very anxious}} upon this {{question}} of fact.|$|E
60|$|But <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> gravely, {{and without}} any sign of melting.|$|E
60|$|She {{hesitated a}} moment; <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with pitifully {{appealing}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>at</b> {{the black}} sweep {{of her hair}} under the white band, <b>at</b> <b>her</b> eyes, like jet; and {{suddenly}} realized, with a gladness new and strange to him, that <b>he</b> liked to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> that she was beautiful.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> down <b>at</b> <b>her</b> face, luminous, quivering with excitement--and understood.|$|R
