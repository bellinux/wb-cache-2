5000|$|For {{the second}} {{consecutive}} year, the fight for ROTY {{was expected to be}} fierce, as competitors from all areas or racing expertise battled in NASCAR's top level. The most profiled rookie was ex-Formula One driver Juan Pablo Montoya, <b>driving</b> <b>Chip</b> Ganassi Racing's No. 42 Dodge vacated by Casey Mears. Montoya would permanently leave F1 after a fallout with his boss, Ron Dennis. Montoya was widely criticized for his over aggressive driving style in his open wheel days. Although this came to be true {{in the early part of}} the season, Montoya, with help from his owner, teammates, and crew chiefs, managed to tame his aggressive nature and translate it into his first ever win at Infineon Raceway, becoming the first foreign driver to win a race since Earl Ross of Canada at Martinsville in 1974. The win would propel Montoya to be the first ever foreign born driver to win ROTY. Runner-up David Ragan had big shoes to fill, as he would be taking over the legendary No. 6 ride for veteran Mark Martin. Despite his limited experience in NASCAR, having only run part-time in the ARCA RE/MAX Series and the Craftsman Truck Series, Ragan would make a splash with a fifth-place finish in the Daytona 500. After that, he would have an up and down year, gaining experience along the way. As Montoya and Ragan were the only two drivers with guaranteed starting spots, the rest of the rookies were trying to make races with new teams. Busch Series driver Paul Menard contunied his relationship with DEI, but struggled to make races until the DEI-Ginn merger (see [...] "Merger Mania" [...] section). Another open wheel immigrant, ex-Champ Car driver A. J. Allmendinger struggled to adjust to stock cars, and his development as a driver was further hampered with his allegiance with Toyota, a new manufacturer. Former Truck Series driver David Reutimann also struggled with a new team and manufacturer, and like Allmendinger and Menard, was out of the critical top 35 in owners points. Brandon Whitt attempted at least a partial schedule with CJM Racing, but after missing race after race, the team decided to release Whitt and move down to the Busch Series.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{statistical}} simulation as a fast simulation {{technique for}} <b>driving</b> <b>chip</b> multiprocessor (CMP) design space exploration. The idea of statistical simulation is to measure {{a number of}} important program execution characteristics, generate a synthetic trace, and simulate that synthetic trace. The important benefit is that a synthetic trace is very small compared to real program traces. This paper advances statistical simulation by modeling shared resources, such as shared caches and off-chip bandwidth. This is done (i) by collecting cache set access probabilities and per-set LRU stack depth profiles, and (ii) by modeling a program’s time-varying execution behavior in the synthetic trace. The key benefit is that the statistical profile is independent of a given cache configuration and the amount of multiprocessing, which enables statistical simulation to model conflict behavior in shared caches when multiple programs are co-executing on a CMP. We demonstrate that statistical simulation is both accurate and fast with average IPC prediction errors of less than 5. 5 % and simulation speedups of 40 X to 70 X compared to the detailed simulation of 100 M-instruction traces. This makes statistical simulation a viable tool for CMP design space exploration. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Energy-recycling output pad {{cells for}} <b>driving</b> {{adiabatic}} <b>chips</b> are designed, {{which have been}} fabricated with Chartered 0. 35 um process and tested. The proposed energy-recycling output pad cells include mainly bonding pads, electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection circuits, and two stage energy-recycling buffers {{that are used to}} drive the large load capacitances on chip pads. The two stage energy-recycling buffers are realized using CPAL (Complementary Pass-transistor Adiabatic Logic) and PAL- 2 N (pass-transistor adiabatic logic with NMOS pull-down configuration), respectively. For comparison, a conventional output pad cell is also embedded in the test chip. The function verifications and energy loss tests for the three output pad cells are carried out. The energy consumption of the proposed two energy-recycling output pad cells has large savings over a wide range of frequencies, as compared with the conventional CMOS counterparts, since the energy on large load capacitances in the chip pads can be well recycled...|$|R
