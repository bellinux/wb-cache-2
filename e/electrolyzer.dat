25|$|Research {{concerning}} {{the production of}} hydrogen from electrolysis of water by a wind farm began in 2004 at a newly installed laboratory in the Universidad Pública de Navarra under an agreement between Energía Hidroeléctrica de Navarra, Stuart Energy Systems of Canada, and Statkraft of Norway.

25|$|High {{pressure}} electrolysis is the electrolysis of water by {{decomposition of water}} (H2O) into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen gas (H2) {{by means of an}} electric current being passed through the water. The difference with a standard <b>electrolyzer</b> is the compressed hydrogen output around 120-200 bar (1740-2900 psi, 12–20 MPa). By pressurising the hydrogen in the electrolyser, through a process known as chemical compression, the need for an external hydrogen compressor is eliminated, the average energy consumption for internal compression is around 3%.|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen-oxygen solid polymer {{electrolyte}} (SPE) {{fuel cells}} and SPE <b>electrolyzers</b> (products of Hamilton Standard) both use a Proton-Exchange Membrane (PEM) {{as the sole}} electrolyte. These solid electrolyte devices have been under continuous development for over 30 years. This experience {{has resulted in a}} demonstrated ten-year SPE cell life capability under load conditions. Ultimate life of PEM fuel cells and <b>electrolyzers</b> is primarily related to the chemical stability of the membrane. For perfluorocarbon proton exchange membranes an accurate measure of the membrane stability is the fluoride loss rate. Millions of cell hours have contributed to establishing a relationship between fluoride loss rates and average expected ultimate cell life. This relationship is shown. Several features have been introduced into SPE fuel cells and SPE <b>electrolyzers</b> such that applications requiring {{greater than or equal to}} 100, 000 hours of life can be considered. Equally important as the ultimate life is the voltage stability of hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells and <b>electrolyzers.</b> Here again the features of SPE fuel cells and SPE <b>electrolyzers</b> have shown a cell voltage stability in the order of 1 microvolt per hour. That level of stability has been demonstrated for tens of thousands of hours in SPE fuel cells at up to 500 amps per square foot (ASF) current density...|$|R

25|$|A United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) project, the International Centre for Hydrogen Energy Technologies (ICHET) {{set up an}} {{experimental}} renewables-hydrogen energy facility at the Bozcaada Governor's building on 7 October 2011. The project, supported by the Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR), {{is the first of}} its kind in the country. The power plant produces energy via a 20kW solar photovoltaic array, and uses a 50kW <b>electrolyzer</b> to store this energy as hydrogen.

2500|$|Since {{fuel cell}} <b>electrolyzer</b> systems do not store fuel in themselves, but rather rely on {{external}} storage units, {{they can be}} successfully applied in large-scale energy storage, rural areas being one example. There are {{many different types of}} stationary fuel cells so efficiencies vary, but most are between 40% and 60% energy efficient. However, when the fuel cell's waste heat is used to heat a building in a cogeneration system this efficiency can increase to 85%. This is significantly more efficient than traditional coal power plants, which are only about one third energy efficient. Assuming production at scale, fuel cells could save 20–40% on energy costs when used in cogeneration systems. Fuel cells are also much cleaner than traditional power generation; a fuel cell power plant using natural gas as a hydrogen source would create less than one ounce of pollution (other than [...] ) for every 1,000kW·h produced, compared to 25 pounds of pollutants generated by conventional combustion systems. Fuel Cells also produce 97% less nitrogen oxide emissions than conventional coal-fired power plants.|$|E

40|$|Water {{electrolysis}} is {{a promising}} technology for enabling {{the storage of}} surplus electricity produced by intermittent renewable power sources {{in the form of}} hydrogen. At the core of this technology is the electrolyte, and whether this is acidic or alkaline affects the reaction mechanisms, gas purities and is of significant importance for the stability and activity of the electrocatalysts. This article presents a simple but precise physical model to describe the voltage-current characteristic, heat balance, gas crossover and cell efficiency of water <b>electrolyzers.</b> State-of-the-art water electrolysis cells with acidic and alkaline electrolyte are experimentally characterized in order to parameterize the model. A rigorous comparison shows that alkaline water <b>electrolyzers</b> with Ni-based catalysts but thinner separators than those typically used is expected be more efficient than acidic water electrolysis with Ir and Pt based catalysts. This performance difference was attributed mainly to a similar conductivity but approximately 38 -fold higher diffusivities of hydrogen and oxygen in the acidic polymer electrolyte membrane (Nafion) than those in the alkaline separator (Zirfon filled with a 30 [*]wt} KOH solution).
