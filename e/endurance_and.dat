5|$|Turbines {{were never}} {{replaced}} in battleship design.

50|$|A flat-12 is a 12-cylinder {{internal}} combustion engine in a flat configuration. Rarer, wider, and less tall than a V12, the flat-12 design was used in Formula One <b>and</b> <b>Endurance</b> racing <b>and</b> some exotic sports cars.|$|R
5|$|Damage from {{enemies to}} the player's {{characters}} affect an <b>endurance</b> <b>and</b> health pool. While endurance regenerates after combat, health {{can only be}} restored by resting. The party can either set up camp, or rest in an inn. If a character in the party has their endurance drained, they are knocked out {{until the end of}} combat. If a companion has their health reduced to zero they die permanently.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} {{defensive}} forwards of his era, Phillips was also known for his all-around skill, particularly his strong shot and <b>endurance,</b> <b>and</b> was considered, alongside Frank McGee, {{one of the two}} best players in all of hockey.

5|$|The Mérens {{has long}} {{been used as a}} {{delivery}} and courier horse, as well as being used by local farmers. It has also been used by the winemakers of Languedoc, gardeners and dock workers, as well as continuing to be used by French armies, who appreciated its endurance. The breed was used in the mines, both under saddle and in harness. It was used by smugglers moving goods through the mountains between France and Spain, mainly carrying wood and minerals, and was known for its <b>endurance</b> <b>and</b> sense of direction.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{is quick}} to learn but can be headstrong, though with correct {{training}} can become very obedient. The Welsh Springer was bred for work and <b>endurance,</b> <b>and</b> as with many breeds of hunting dogs requires a regular exercise routine to keep them healthy and content. Without adequate exercise, a Welsh Springer Spaniel may appear hyperactive. Some Welsh Springers can become clingy towards their owners and suffer separation anxiety when alone.|$|E
5|$|The third {{source of}} over-provisioning comes from known free {{space on the}} drive, gaining <b>endurance</b> <b>and</b> {{performance}} {{at the expense of}} reporting unused portions, and/or at the expense of current or future capacity. This free space can be identified by the operating system using the TRIM command. Alternately, some SSDs provide a utility that permit the end user to select additional over-provisioning. Furthermore, if any SSD is set up with an overall partitioning layout smaller than 100% of the available space, that unpartitioned space will be automatically used by the SSD as over-provisioning as well. Yet another source of over-provisioning is operating system minimum free space limits; some operating systems maintain a certain minimum free space per drive, particularly on the boot or main drive. If this additional space can be identified by the SSD, perhaps through continuous usage of the TRIM command, then this acts as semi-permanent over-provisioning. Over-provisioning often takes away from user capacity, either temporarily or permanently, but it gives back reduced write amplification, increased <b>endurance,</b> <b>and</b> increased performance.|$|E

5|$|Tritons globe-girdling cruise proved {{invaluable}} to the United States. Politically, it {{enhanced the}} nation's prestige.

Moreover, during the voyage, the submarine collected reams of oceanographic data. At the cruise's conclusion, Triton received the Presidential Unit Citation and Captain Beach received the Legion of Merit from President Dwight D. Eisenhower.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its impact}} and scale, the Battle of Triangle Hill {{is one of}} the least known episodes of the Korean War within the Western media. For the Chinese, this costly victory {{presented}} an opportunity to promote the value of <b>endurance</b> <b>and</b> sacrifice. The courage demonstrated by the Chinese soldiers at Triangle Hill was repeatedly glorified in various forms of media, including several major motion pictures. Qin Jiwei was also celebrated as the hero of Shangganling and eventually rose to become the Minister of Defense and the Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress. The 15th Corps {{became one of the most}} prestigious units within the PLA, and the PLAAF selected the 15th Corps to become China's first airborne corps in 1961. It remains the most elite corps-size unit in China today.|$|E

5|$|Draught camel {{are used}} for several {{purposes}} including ploughing, processing in oil mills and pulling carts. There is no clear description for the ideal draught camel, though its strength, its ability to survive without water and the flatness of its feet could be indicators. It {{may be used for}} ploughing in pairs or in groups with buffaloes or bullocks. The draught camel can plough at around , and should not be used for more than six hours a day four hours in the morning and two in the afternoon. The camel is not easily exhausted unless diseased or undernourished, and has remarkable <b>endurance</b> <b>and</b> hardiness.|$|E
5|$|For {{purposes}} of geophysical and oceanographic research {{and to determine}} habitability, <b>endurance</b> <b>and</b> psychological stress – all extremely important to the Polaris program – it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the areas of interest, should be conducted. Maximum stability of the observing platform and unbroken continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our own or other forces and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of her size, speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, had been chosen for the mission.|$|E
5|$|Physiotherapy {{interventions}} include strength, <b>endurance</b> <b>and</b> gait {{training with}} graduated increases in mobility, maintenance of posture and alignment {{as well as}} joint function. Occupational therapy aims to improve everyday function with domestic and community tasks as well as driving and work. Home modifications, gait aids, orthotics and splints may be provided. Speech-language pathology input may be required in those with speech and swallowing problems, {{as well as to}} support communication in those who require ongoing breathing support (often through a tracheostomy). Nutritional support may be provided by the team and by dietitians. Psychologists may provide counseling and support. Psychological interventions may also be required for anxiety, fear and depression.|$|E
