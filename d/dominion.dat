5|$|In Brood War, the <b>Dominion</b> is {{invaded by}} the United Earth Directorate and Mengsk {{narrowly}} escapes capture with the reluctant help of Raynor. Faced with execution {{and the destruction}} of the <b>Dominion</b> as alternatives, Mengsk allies with Kerrigan and Raynor to defeat the UED, but Kerrigan eventually betrays their alliance and delivers a crippling blow to Mengsk's forces. Nevertheless, Mengsk rebuilds and the <b>Dominion</b> remains the dominant Terran power. In Frontline, many of the stories in the anthology paint Mengsk and the <b>Dominion</b> overall as tyrannical and corrupt, no different from the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|After {{collecting}} more artifact pieces, Raynor's forces encounter <b>Dominion</b> battleships at the pre-agreed Moebius Foundation rendezvous point. The Moebius Foundation {{is revealed}} {{to be under the}} control of Valerian Mengsk, Arcturus' son. Valerian, intending to show himself as a worthy successor to his father, asks Raynor to help him invade Char and use the artifact to restore Kerrigan's humanity, thus weakening the Zerg. To the initial dismay of the crew, Raynor agrees. With Valerian's aid, Raynor recovers the final artifact piece, and the Raiders and <b>Dominion</b> invade Char. The <b>Dominion</b> fleet is devastated by the heavy Zerg defenses, but Raynor secures a foothold on Char and rendezvouses with <b>Dominion</b> forces led by Horace Warfield, a decorated <b>Dominion</b> general. Warfield is later injured and appoints Raynor commander of surviving <b>Dominion</b> forces as well. The combined forces of the Raiders and <b>Dominion</b> military push towards the main Hive Cluster of the planet, protecting the artifact as it charges to full power, and the artifact eventually destroys all Zerg within its blast radius. Raynor's team finds Kerrigan restored to human form; however, Tychus reveals that he made a deal with Arcturus Mengsk, trading Kerrigan's life for his own freedom. Raynor defends Kerrigan from Tychus' attempt to kill her, fatally shooting Tychus in the process. The closing scene shows Raynor carrying Sarah Kerrigan out of the main hive in his arms.|$|E

5|$|After the {{partition}} of India in 1947, Bengali-speaking people in East Bengal, the non-contiguous {{eastern part of the}} <b>Dominion</b> of Pakistan, made up 44 million of the newly formed <b>Dominion</b> of Pakistan's 69 million people. The <b>Dominion</b> of Pakistan's government, civil services, and military, however, were dominated by personnel from the western wing of the <b>Dominion</b> of Pakistan. In 1947, a key resolution at a national education summit in Karachi advocated Urdu as the sole state language, and its exclusive use in the media and in schools. Opposition and protests immediately arose. Students from Dhaka rallied under the leadership of Abul Kashem, the secretary of Tamaddun Majlish, a Bengali Islamic cultural organisation. The meeting stipulated Bengali as an official language of the <b>Dominion</b> of Pakistan and as a medium of education in East Bengal. However, the Pakistan Public Service Commission removed Bengali from the list of approved subjects, as well as from currency notes and stamps. The central education minister Fazlur Rahman made extensive preparations to make Urdu the only state language of the <b>Dominion</b> of Pakistan. Public outrage spread, and many Bengali students met on the University of Dhaka campus on 8 December 1947 to formally demand that Bengali be made an official language. To promote their cause, Bengali students organised processions and rallies in Dhaka.|$|E

5|$|Four {{years after}} the Brood War, the <b>Dominion</b> is once again the {{dominant}} Terran power in the Koprulu sector. News reports reveal that {{in the four years}} {{since the end of the}} Brood Wars, the standing <b>Dominion</b> military forces have been reduced and defense budget has instead been diverted to hunting down rebel forces that operate against the <b>Dominion.</b> For reasons unknown, Kerrigan gathered the swarm at Char and then vanished from sight. With the Zerg gone, the Protoss have once again taken a passive role in the galaxy. Jim Raynor has formed a revolutionary group named Raynor's Raiders in order to overthrow <b>Dominion</b> Emperor Arcturus Mengsk. On Mar Sara, Raynor meets with an old comrade, Tychus Findlay. Together, they liberate the local population from <b>Dominion</b> control and also discover a component of a mysterious Xel'Naga artifact.

50|$|During the 1926 Imperial Conference, {{the governments}} of the <b>Dominions</b> and of the United Kingdom {{endorsed}} the Balfour Declaration of 1926, which declared that the <b>Dominions</b> were autonomous members of the British Empire, equal {{to each other and to}} the United Kingdom.

Most importantly, it declared that the Parliament of the United Kingdom no longer had any legislative authority over the <b>Dominions.</b> Previously, the <b>Dominions</b> were legally colonies of the United Kingdom, and thus had no legal international status.

5|$|In Wings of Liberty, Mengsk {{and his son}} Valerian {{find the}} <b>Dominion</b> opposed by several rebel and {{paramilitary}} groups, including those loyal to Raynor. Arcturus suffers compound setbacks during the game, initially due to the mass invasion of <b>Dominion</b> space by Zerg forces which catches the <b>Dominion</b> military and Mengsk unprepared, and later from Raynor's Raiders who capture and broadcast proof of Mengsk's war crimes during the events of StarCraft. Despite these setbacks Arcturus manages to overcome these hardships, maintaining his position as Emperor of the <b>Dominion</b> {{for the remainder of}} the game. During the events of Heart of the Swarm, Mengsk tries to have Kerrigan killed on several occasions, including issuing an obituary about Raynor. Kerrigan however, successfully reunites the Zerg Swarm and storms the <b>Dominion</b> capital of Augustgrad on the planet Korhal with help from Raynor's Raiders. After a showdown with Acturus Mengsk inside his Palace, Kerrigan manages to gain the upper hand with help from James Raynor, and kills Acturus by overloading his body with psychic energy, causing him to explode spectacularly. In the wake of his death, Valerian ascends to the throne vacated by Arcturus.|$|E

5|$|After James was deposed by William III and Mary II in the Glorious Revolution in late 1688, Massachusetts rose up in {{rebellion}} against Andros, arresting {{him and other}} <b>dominion</b> leaders in Boston. The revolt rapidly spread through the <b>dominion,</b> and the New England colonies quickly restored their pre-dominion governments. When news of the Boston revolt reached New York a week later, Nicholson took no steps to announce news of it, or of the revolution in England, for fear of raising prospects of rebellion in New York. When word of the Boston revolt reached Long Island, politicians and militia leaders became more assertive, and by mid-May <b>dominion</b> officials had been ousted {{from a number of}} communities. At the same time, Nicholson learned that France had declared war on England, bringing the threat of French and Indian attacks on New York's northern frontier. In an attempt to mollify panicked citizenry over rumored Indian raids, Nicholson invited the militia to join the army garrison at Fort James.|$|E
