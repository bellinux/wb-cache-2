40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a number of}} reports have {{appeared}} giving the results of analytical studies on viruses by high speed centrifugation. In most of these studies two general procedures have been used. One {{of these is the}} so called inverted capillary method developed by Elford (1) from the original Bechhold and Schlesinger (2) technique. It employs an <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> <b>centrifuge</b> of commercial type and depends on correlating after each of a series of runs the activity of sampled material with the time of centrifugation. No preliminary concentration or purification of the virus is required. The other procedure is an adaptation of the ultracentrifugafion method developed by Svedberg (3) for the study of proteins. The original method utilizes the principle of recording photographically the sedimentation of the material while the centrifuge is actually in rotation. The light used is of a wave length which is absorbed considerably more by the solute than by the solvent. Serial photographs are taken while the material is being centrifuged in a transparent cell, the sedimentation being indicated by differences in the amount of light transmitted at various levels in the eeU. The behavior of sedimenting material in the revolving cell has also been investigated by various refractiv...|$|E

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} Giesekus {{constitutive equation}} for a straight <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> jet is {{integrated into the}} governing equations. Axisymmetric stability of the <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> jet is analyzed using small perturbation method. In the model, the solvent is treated as Newtonian fluid and the polymer as a viscoelastic fluid, with viscosity ratio of polymer to solvent being treated as an important parameter. Our results show that polymer to solvent viscosity ratio affects stability of the straight <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> jet. Small viscosity does not necessarily induce instability {{and it is only}} when the viscosity is small and the polymer to solvent viscosity ratio is large that instability occurs. The viscosity ratio is closely related to the elasticity of Giesekus fluid with the fact that large elasticity destabilizes the straight <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> jet.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{mechanisms}} behind the <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> insulator-metal transition in single crystalline VO$_ 2 $ nanobeams. Our DC and AC transport measurements and the versatile harmonic analysis method employed show that non-uniform Joule heating causes phase inhomogeneities to develop within the nanobeam and {{is responsible for}} driving the transition in VO$_{ 2 }$. A Poole-Frenkel like purely electric field induced transition {{is found to be}} absent and the role of percolation near and away from the <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> transition in VO$_{ 2 }$ is also identified. The results and the harmonic analysis can be generalized to many strongly correlated materials that exhibit <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> transitions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the design of}} exponential tracking control using backstepping approach for voltage-based control of a flexible joint <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> robot (EFJR), {{to cope with the}} difficulty introduced by the cascade structure in EFJR dynamic model, to deal with flexibility in joints, and to ensure fast tracking performance. Backstepping approach is used to ensure global asymptotic stability and its common algorithm is modified such that the link position and velocity errors converge to zero exponentially fast. In contrast with the other backstepping controller for <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> flexible joint robot manipulators control problem, the proposed controller is robust with respect to stiffness uncertainty and allows tracking fast motions. Simulation results are presented for both single link flexible joint <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> manipulator and 2 -DOF flexible joint <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> robot manipulator. These simulations show very satisfactory tracking performances and the superiority of the proposed controller to those performed in the literature using simple backstepping methodology...|$|R

40|$|An <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> single-photon source {{has been}} {{monolithically}} integrated with nano-photonic circuitry. Electroluminescent emission {{from a single}} InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) is channelled through a suspended nanobeam waveguide. The emission line has a linewidth of below 6 μeV, demonstrating the ability {{to have a high}} coherence, <b>electrically</b> <b>driven,</b> waveguide coupled QD source. The single-photon nature of the emission is verified by g(2) (τ) correlation measurements. Moreover, in a cross-correlation experiment, with emission collected from the two ends of the waveguide, the emission and propagation of single photons from the same QD is confirmed. This work provides the basis for the development of <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> on-chip single-photon sources, which can be readily coupled to waveguide filters, directional couplers, phase shifters, and other elements of quantum photonic networks...|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, an <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> phase {{transition}} was observed as the environmental temperature was increased to 40  °C, but the thermally induced phase transformation {{still did not}} occur. However, the resistivity was small at 40  °C than that at room temperature. Further, the switching voltage was reduced to approximately 7  V, which was lower than the value at room temperature. Therefore, thermal energy can assist the <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> phase transformation of VO 2 thin films. When the environmental temperature approached {{the value of the}} thermal phase transformation temperature at 60  °C, the resistance change during the <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> {{phase transition}} was very small, as shown by the green curves in Fig.  3 a. At 80  °C, the VO 2 thin films were in metallic states, and no abrupt change in resistance was observed. Notably, the switching voltage monotonically decreased as the temperature increased.|$|R
40|$|We {{designed}} {{a class of}} layered microribbons self-assembled from perylene diimide (PDI) molecules that exhibited a fast <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> twisting response. By increasing {{the length of the}} side chains of the PDIs, the microribbons maintained the same intralayer molecular orientation but exhibited enlarged interlayer distances, and the elasticity moduli of the resulting layered microribbons were effectively reduced from similar to 1. 5 GPa to similar to 75 MPa. The <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> twisting response of the microribbons was inversely proportional to the elasticity modulus, indicating that the electroresponse of the resulting materials can be controlled through the interlayer distance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the influence of the elastic modulus of the microribbons on the <b>electrically</b> <b>driven</b> twisting follows a screw dislocation mechanism.
