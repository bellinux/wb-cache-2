6000|$|Mrs. McWilliams sped to {{the nursery}} {{to see how things}} were going on there. She was back <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new dread. She said: ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{stood in}} silence while {{he ran into}} the cottage; {{returning}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> crumpled scrap of paper. On it there was pencilled as follows:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have seen}} her." [...] And then, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sudden soft smile--"E bella!" [...] said the little girl. She was {{beautiful}} {{herself as she}} said it.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Williams {{went out}} and {{returned}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> the book.|$|R
60|$|The waiter withdrew, and {{returned}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> manager, who bowed with obsequious respect.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come!" [...] cried Carthoris. [...] "There {{is no time}} to be lost. Astok will be back <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> enough warriors to {{overpower}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Ah well then, she shan’t go there,” {{he threw}} off <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small strange dry laugh that {{attached}} his mother’s eyes in shy penetration to his face.|$|E
6000|$|Frank's {{face grew}} saddened <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> terrible sadness; {{but he said}} in a firm voice, [...] "I promise," [...] and he never broke his word from that day onward.|$|E
6000|$|... "My darling, {{you forget}} yourself," [...] said Mrs. Light, with {{an attempt at}} majestic severity. [...] "Of course," [...] she added, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> change of note, [...] "the bust would be my own property." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My gracious lord {{is pleased}} to jest," [...] she said, all her fears {{returning}} to her <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> overwhelming rush that made her sick with horror.|$|R
6000|$|Nan was on {{the spot}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> the case that never left her pocket; and the wound was neatly {{plastered}} up by the time Mrs Jo arrived, demanding tragically: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> {{the wind}} cutting keenly at him sideways, he was {{staggering}} {{down to his}} boat; <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> he was clear, and creeping up the river under their own shore.|$|R
6000|$|It is very {{possible}} that Verena was provoked, inaccessible as she was, {{in a general}} way, to irritation; for she rejoined <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little deliberate air: [...] "Well, perhaps it's as well you shouldn't go, if you haven't changed at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|Osmond {{appeared}} to give no heed to this; he sat {{gazing at the}} fire. [...] "Pansy {{would like to be}} a great lady," [...] he remarked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> certain tenderness of tone. [...] "She wishes above all to please," [...] he added.|$|E
6000|$|Maria dashed at {{the purse}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> scream of {{laughter}} shook its contents upon the table, and sure enough, five little packets wrapped in paper rolled out upon the cloth, besides bank-notes and silver and golden coin. [...] "I'm to go, am I? I'm a thief, am I?" [...] screamed the girl, clapping her hands. [...] "I sor 'em yesterday when I was a-lacing of her; {{and thought of}} that pore young man working night and day to get the money;--me a thief, indeed!--I despise you, and I give you warning." ...|$|E
6000|$|How {{dramatic}} it all was, as Ailie said frequently afterwards. She {{was back}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> {{her hand on}} her heart. [...] "Mr. Sandys," [...] were her astounding words, [...] "a lady wants to see you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I am glad!" [...] and Mrs. Penniman {{surveyed}} her cashmere in the glass. Then, [...] "How is your father?" [...] {{she asked}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> {{her eyes on}} her niece. [...] "Your letters were so meagre--I could never tell!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, I suppose I {{may look}} at Ada's slate, though you must not,' said Claude, {{laughing}} to himself at poor little honest simplicity, as he applied himself {{to cut a}} new point to her very stumpy slate-pencil, and she scampered away, and returned <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> her clean slate.|$|R
60|$|She {{came back}} again <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tray on which were a cottage loaf, {{a slab of}} butter, and a jar of {{strawberry}} jam. While she placed the things on the table her father chaffed her. He said it was quite time she was walking out; he told Philip {{that she was very}} proud, and would {{have nothing to do with}} aspirants to that honour who lined up at the door, two by two, outside the Sunday school and craved the honour of escorting her home.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, Rosa, not a word! Let the man {{listen to}} what I say! My son, {{who has been the}} object of my life, to whom its every thought has been devoted, whom I have gratified from a child in every wish, from whom I have had no {{separate}} existence since his birth,--to take up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> miserable girl, and avoid me! To repay my confidence with systematic deception, for her sake, and quit me for her! To set this wretched fancy, against his mother's claims upon his duty, love, respect, gratitude--claims that every day and hour of his life should have strengthened into ties that nothing could be proof against! Is this no injury?' ...|$|E
60|$|Once {{more there}} was silence. Then again that wind blew, very strongly, {{extinguishing}} the lamps, and, {{as it seemed}} to me, whirling away Merapi from where she was, so that now she stood {{to one side of}} the statue. The sanctuary was filled with gloom, till presently the first rays of the rising sun struck upon the roof. They fell down, down, as minute followed minute, till at length they rested like a sword of flame upon the statue of Amon-Ra. Once more that statue seemed to move. I thought that it lifted its stone arms to protect its head. Then <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rending noise, its mighty mass burst asunder, and fell in small dust about the throne, almost hiding it from sight.|$|E
60|$|Words failed her. She {{broke off}} with a very faint primly angry smile. She was perhaps the more {{offended}} with him because of that flutter {{at the beginning of}} the conversation. And <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> perfect tact and dignity she got up from her chair and left him alone.|$|R
60|$|Before I {{could say}} a word she {{vanished}} and presently I heard a confusion of shrill protestations <b>in</b> <b>a</b> distant part of the house. Obviously no one could tell her how I got there. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> great outcries from two negro women following her, she waddled back to the doorway, infuriated.|$|R
60|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> {{the sound}} of that {{peremptory}} call outside, tumultuous passions seemed to sink to rest, every cheek paled, and masculine hands instinctively sought the handles of swords whilst lace handkerchiefs were hastily pressed to trembling lips, in order to smother the cry of terror which had risen to feminine throats.|$|R
6000|$|I {{walked away}} at a good pace, {{thinking}} {{it was easier to}} go than I had supposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to have had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High Street. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was very peaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to show me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all beyond was so unknown and great, that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strong heave and sob I broke into tears. It was by the finger-post {{at the end of the}} village, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, [...] "Good by, O my dear, dear friend!" ...|$|E
6000|$|About six o'clock, {{the time}} {{announced}} for the ceremony, I elbowed {{my way through}} the expectant throng of men, women, and children that already besieged the smith's door. Shrill demands of [...] "Toss, toss!" [...] rent the air every time Jess's head showed on the window-blind, and Andra hoped, as I pushed open the door, [...] "that I hadna forgotten my bawbees." [...] Weddings were celebrated among the Auld Lichts by showers of ha'pence, and the guests {{on their way to the}} bride's house had to scatter to the hungry rabble like housewives feeding poultry. Willie Todd, the best man, who had never come out so strong in his life before, slipped through the back window, while the crowd, led on by Kitty McQueen, seethed in front, and making a bolt for it to the [...] "'Sosh," [...] was back <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> handful of small change. [...] "Dinna toss ower lavishly at first," [...] the smith whispered me nervously, as we followed Jess and Willie into the darkening wynd.|$|E
6000|$|... "You wouldn't {{fire on a}} flag of truce, would ye, you dishonourable ould civilian?" [...] replied Mr. Macshane. [...] "Besides," [...] says he, [...] "there's more {{reasons to}} prevent you: the first is this," [...] {{pointing}} to his sword; [...] "here are two more"--and these were pistols; [...] "and the last {{and the best of}} all is, that you might hang me and dthraw me and quarther me, an yet never see so much as the tip of your son's nose again. Look you, sir, we run mighty risks in our profession--it's not all play, I can tell you. We're obliged to be punctual, too, or it's all up with the thrade. If I promise that your son will die as sure as fate to-morrow morning, unless I return home safe, our people MUST keep my promise; or else what chance is there for me? You would be down upon me <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> posse of constables, and have me swinging before Warwick gaol. Pooh, my dear! you never would sacrifice a darling boy like John Hayes, let alone his lady, for the sake of my long carcass. One or two of our gentlemen have been taken that way already, because parents and guardians would not believe them." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> the {{swiftness}} born of long usage, the demeanour of {{the three}} gentlemen underwent a quick and sudden change. They seemed to pull their gorgeous figures together; with practised fingers each readjusted the lace of his cravat, reëstablished the correct set of his waistcoat, and flickered the last grain of dust or snuff from the satin-like surface of his coat.|$|R
60|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> savage {{shouts and}} yells, their assailants were upon them, smiting and thrusting. With a shout, Philip spurred {{forward from the}} other side. He saw at once that, against such numbers, he and his three {{followers}} could do nothing; but his rage at this massacre of innocent people--a scene common enough in France, but which he {{now for the first}} time witnessed--half maddened him.|$|R
50|$|Born in Elmhurst, Illinois in 1952, McCann grew up {{with his}} brother and his sister (Mary McCann, now a {{well-known}} radio DJ in her own right, based in Seattle) in the greater Chicago area - mostly in Skokie. McCann's first memory of making someone laugh {{is said to have}} been <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> his father. He did standup for some years in Illinois, where he met Arsenio Hall and Jay Leno.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Won't {{you come}} {{in out of the}} wet, sir?' asked Reuben, who could scarce keep serious at the stranger's {{appearance}} and address. A pair of long arms shot out of the water, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lithe, snake-like motion, the man wound himself into the boat and coiled his great length upon the stern-sheets. Very lanky he was and very thin, with a craggy hard face, clean-shaven and sunburned, with a thousand little wrinkles intersecting it in every direction. He had lost his hat, and his short wiry hair, slightly flecked with grey, stood up in a bristle all over his head. It was hard to guess at his age, but he could scarce have been under his fiftieth year, though the ease with which he had boarded our boat proved that his strength and energy were unimpaired. Of all his characteristics, however, nothing attracted my attention so much as his eyes, which were almost covered by their drooping lids, and yet looked out through the thin slits which remained with marvellous brightness and keenness. A passing glance might give the idea that he was languid and half asleep, but a closer one would reveal those glittering, shifting lines of light, and warn the prudent man not to trust too much to his first impressions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it's no good {{talking to}} you—I don't want——" [...] She turned away, {{went to the}} laurestinus, and began pulling off it the long red berries. I {{expected}} she would fret the evening wastefully away. I noticed all at once that she stood still. It was the noise of a motor-car running rapidly down the hill towards Nethermere—a light, quick-clicking sound. I listened also. I could feel the swinging drop of the car as it came down the leaps of the hill. We could see the dust trail up among the trees. Lettie raised her head and listened expectantly. The car rushed {{along the edge of}} Nethermere—then there was the jar of brakes, as the machine slowed down and stopped. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> quick flutter of sound, it was passing the lodge-gates and whirling up the drive, through the wood, to us. Lettie stood with flushed cheeks and brightened eyes. She went towards the bushes that shut off the lawn from the gravelled space in front of the house, watching. A car came racing through the trees. It was the small car Leslie used on the firm's business—now it was white with dust. Leslie suddenly put on the brakes, and tore to a standstill in front of the house. He stepped to the ground. There he staggered a little, being giddy and cramped with the long drive. His motor-jacket and cap were thick with dust.|$|E
5000|$|The venture {{was a great}} success, Homburg {{became popular}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lot of entertainment, {{gambling}} houses, hotels - all the richest and famous came there for new emotions and fun. In a while François Blanc was given the name [...] "The Magician of Homburg".|$|E
50|$|She {{composed}} poetic {{plays of}} her own, mostly in one act (Revenge of Amur, Eternity <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Moment,</b> Lady <b>with</b> Violets, Happy Women, etc.).|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well;' {{and there}} was a cloud, but it cleared <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> few gay words to both, he rode off at a quick pace.|$|R
60|$|Mary retired, {{to return}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> nearly {{speechless}} <b>with</b> merriment.|$|R
