40|$|As discussions {{around the}} {{revision}} of MiFID are heating up, this paper tries {{to set a}} new regulatory and institutional framework for multilateral and bilateral execution mechanisms of complex financial instruments, such as over-the-counter derivatives and fixed income products. The author argues that the current MiFID framework is equipped to capture {{a great deal of}} multilateral derivatives and fixed income trading, but the Directive fails to provide a complete definition of bilateral execution mechanisms and has narrowed it to mainly own account trading (e. g. systematic <b>internaliser).</b> A key proposal {{of this paper is to}} consider own account trading, agency trades (discretionary matching) and principal trading as pure bilateral execution services to be classified under a broader definition of systematic <b>internaliser</b> (with revised obligations), subject then to the application of conduct of business rules (e. g. conflicts of interests management procedures) and a best execution regime. MTF would then be adapted to explicitly state that multilateral systems are not just those bringing together multiple interests from third parties, but those systems bringing together interests through ‘non-discretionary ’ services, vis-à-vis membership, admission of products to trading, and matching of interests. Finally, despite the claim that OTF and SEF would be equivalent categories, US and EU regulators are defining diverging regulations for these venues. There are at least four important areas in which the SEF definitions do not match the proposed EU rules for OTFs...|$|E

50|$|Although MiFID was {{intended}} to increase transparency for prices, the fragmentation of trading venues has had an unanticipated effect. Where once a financial institution {{was able to see}} information from just one or two exchanges, they now have the possibility (and in some cases the obligation) to collect information from a multitude of multilateral trading facilities, Systematic <b>Internalisers</b> and other exchanges from around the European Economic Area (EEA). This results in an additional amount of work to benefit from the transparency that MiFID has introduced.|$|R

40|$|Background: Better {{indicators}} {{are needed for}} identifying children with early signs of developmental psychopathology. Aims: To identify measures of autonomic nervous system reactivity that discriminate children with internalising and externalising behavioural symptoms. Method: Across-sectional study of 122 children aged 6 - 7 years examined sympathetic and parasympathetic reactivity to standardised field-laboratory stressors as predictors of parent- and teacher-reported mental health symptoms. Results: Measures of autonomic reactivity discriminated between children with internalising behaviour problems, externalising behaviour problems and neither. <b>Internalisers</b> showed high reactivity relative to low-symptom children, principally in the parasympathetic branch, while externalisers showed low reactivity, in both autonomic branches. Conclusions: School-age children with mental health symptoms showed a pattern of autonomic dimorphism in their reactivity to standardised challenges.

40|$|Chemokines are the {{principle}} regulators of leukocyte migration in vivo and function during both normal (homeostatic) and inflammatory conditions to direct leukocytes to appropriate tissue locales. Chemokines mediate their affects by binding to their cognate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which are expressed {{on the surface}} of cells, and generate a signal upon ligand binding resulting in the initiation of a response such as chemotaxis. As well as the classical chemokine receptors which generate a conventional GPCR signal upon ligand binding, there exists a small family of atypical chemokine receptors that are characterised by an inability to mount classical receptor signalling. One of the most prominent members of this family is the atypical chemokine receptor, D 6, which can bind at least 14 inflammatory CC chemokines with high affinity, but instead of the generation of a classical G-protein signalling response, D 6 internalises ligands and targets them for lysosomal-mediated degradation. This functional attribute makes D 6 a highly efficient binder, <b>internaliser</b> and scavenger of inflammatory CC chemokines that {{has been shown to be}} important for the resolution of inflammatory responses in vivo. Despite its well-studied biological role, very little is known about the structure/function relationships within and around D 6 which regulate ligand binding and scavenging. Glycosaminoglycans have been demonstrated to be important for chemokine sequestration and presentation to many of the conventional chemokine receptors. Consequently, the role of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in chemokine presentation to D 6 was studied using a cell line which is deficient in the synthesis of proteoglycans (CHO 745). Transfection of these cells with D 6 and comparison to transfected WT CHO cells revealed that D 6 -mediated uptake and internalisation of chemokine is significantly reduced in the absence of GAGs. The N-terminus of D 6 is thought to be {{the principle}} site for ligand binding, and the ability of D 6 to bind all inflammatory CC chemokines makes this region an attractive target for therapeutic manipulation. Therefore a sulphated peptide representing the first 35 amino acids of D 6 (D 6 -N (s)) was synthesised and investigated for its ability to bind D 6 ligands. D 6 -N (s) was shown to neutralise the activity of the inflammatory CC chemokine CCL 2 and prevent its interaction with its cognate receptor CCR 2 in vitro. Importantly D 6 -N (s) was active, only in a specifically sulphated form, highlighting the importance of sulphated tyrosines for ligand binding. Considering the functional significance of the synthetic D 6 peptide, attempts were made to identify a naturally ‘shed’ D 6 N-terminal peptide which had been reported previously. Further study demonstrated the ability of the bacterial protease staphopain A, released from Staphylococcus aureus, to cleave the N-terminus of D 6 and suppress its ligand internalisation activity. Finally, the conserved tyrosine motif present on the N-terminus of D 6 was investigated more closely. Site-directed mutagenesis and sulphation inhibition of this region revealed the importance of post-translational tyrosine sulphation for ligand binding, internalisation and scavenging of inflammatory chemokines and alluded to the existence of an optimal sulphation pattern for ligand binding. Overall the results presented in this thesis shed new light on the nature of the molecules around, and the structural features within D 6 that contribute to ligand binding and function of this extraordinary receptor. Furthermore, it was shown that a sulphated peptide derived from the N-terminus of D 6 has the potential to be used therapeutically as a broad-based chemokine scavenger, which may be useful for dampening the effects of excessive chemokine production in chronic inflammatory conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether a relationship between attentional styles and effective cognitive strategies affects performance. Participants were 60 novice rowers reduced to a group of <b>internalisers</b> (N = 7) and a group of externalisers (N = 7) through a rigorous use of the Test of Attentional and Interpersonal Style attentional subcomponents (Nideffer, 1976). Each group completed two 15 minute maximal tests on a rowing ergometer: one in an associative condition and one in a dissociative condition in a counterbalanced design. Immediately following both tests, the participants completed a questionnaire evaluating their performance. Results revealed that the internal group completed a significantly greater distance in the associative condition than in the dissociative condition and, conversely, the external group completed a significantly 36 greater distance in the dissociative condition. Questionnaire responses indicated that participants clearly preferred the strategy most similar to their attentional style...|$|R
40|$|Background Current {{population-based}} anti-obesity campaigns often target individuals {{based on}} either weight or socio-demographic characteristics, {{and give a}} 2 ̆ 7 mass 2 ̆ 7 message about personal responsibility. There is a recognition that attempts to influence attitudes and opinions {{may be more effective}} if they resonate with the beliefs that different groups have about the causes of, and solutions for, obesity. Limited research has explored how attitudinal factors may inform the development of both upstream and downstream social marketing initiatives. Methods Computer-assisted face-to-face interviews were conducted with 159 parents and 184 of their children (aged 9 - 18 years old) in two Australian states. A mixed methods approach was used to assess attitudes towards obesity, and elucidate why different groups held various attitudes towards obesity. Participants were quantitatively assessed on eight dimensions relating to the severity and extent, causes and responsibility, possible remedies, and messaging strategies. Cluster analysis was used to determine attitudinal clusters. Participants were also able to qualify each answer. Qualitative responses were analysed both within and across attitudinal clusters using a constant comparative method. Results Three clusters were identified. Concerned <b>Internalisers</b> (27...|$|R
40|$|The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), which {{entered into}} force on 1 November 2007, implies the {{abolition}} of the concentration rule regarding equity transactions so far in force in France. This rule, which was applied to varying degrees across Europe, resulted {{in the vast majority of}} order flow being concentrated in regulated markets, and notably in Euronext Paris for shares listed on the French stock exchange. Over the coming years, order flow will become fragmented de facto as a result of being able to execute client orders on regulated markets as well as on multilateral trading facilities (MTFs), and by use of systematic <b>internalisers</b> (SIs), which act as counterparties for transactions in the same way as market makers on price-driven markets such as the London Stock Exchange (LSE) or Nasdaq. The competition between trading venues, which will be enhanced at the European level, has steadily been increasing since the 1970 s. Since then, alternating series of regulations and technological progress have gradually weakened the monopolistic position of national regulated markets. The impact of this phenomenon has been a continuous fall in transaction costs, benefi ting investors and issuers of securities through a drop in the cost of capital. However, the fragmentation of order fl ow stemming from a proliferation of trading venues may raise concern about a reduction in market liquidity and a slowdown in the decline in transaction costs, which would run counter to the competitive effect between systems sought by the European regulatory authorities. Although the most conservative medium-term scenarios point to continued dominance by regulated markets, we estimate that in the case of France, a very signifi cant share of order fl ow may rapidly be executed on alternative trading systems. Here, we focus on the impact on “wholesale” transactions, i. e. transactions of at least EUR 50, 000, which we attribute to institutional investors. In particular, we identify the portion of these trades currently executed outside the order book. According to our estimates, these transactions constitute roughly 10 % of the traded volume on CAC 40 shares and that may be lost to the regulated market each year. This volume, which would more or less equally be distributed between SIs and MTFs operating crossing systems, only constitutes a fraction of the total volume of the wholesale market. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Comorbidity between {{psychiatric}} disorders {{is the rule}} rather than the exception, with some patterns of comorbidity more common than others. The tendency for disorders to cluster together in predictable patterns can {{be accounted for by}} the existence of higher order internalising and externalising dimensions. These dimensions, in turn, are underpinned by personality traits. The relationship between personality and psychopathology has been a particular focus of researchers interested in explaining the diverse range of psychopathology experienced by survivors of traumatic events. However, extant research in this field has been limited to cross-sectional investigations of PTSD comorbidity, despite the fact that PTSD patients represent only a small minority of trauma survivors. In addition, the relationship between personality and posttraumatic functioning outside of the mental health domain has received minimal attention. Perhaps most importantly, the influence of personality on the longitudinal trajectory of posttraumatic disorders has not been examined. Therefore it is not known whether personality profiles varying on the internalising and externalising dimensions respond differently to trauma exposure over time. Aims: In light of the limitations of the extant literature, this study aimed to 1) investigate whether and how pre-trauma personality influences the trajectory of a range of common posttraumatic disorders, and 2) establish the relationship between personality and non-psychiatric maladaptive responses to trauma. Method: During hospitalisation for serious physical injury, 323 Australian adults completed a retrospective assessment of pre-injury personality and psychiatric history. Post-injury psychiatric diagnoses were assessed 3 and 12 months later using a structured clinical interview. A range of non-psychiatric outcomes were also assessed at 12 months post-injury (e. g., disability, quality of life, anger, risk of re-injury, exposure to trauma and life stress). Latent profile analysis conducted on initial personality scores identified subgroups of participants, while latent change modelling examined differences in disorder trajectories controlling for psychiatric history. Regression analyses were used to investigate the influence of personality on non-psychiatric outcomes. Results: Three personality-based classes of trauma survivors were identified, corresponding to internalising, externalising, and normal personality profiles. After controlling for psychiatric history, the internalising class showed a high risk of developing all disorders. Unexpectedly, however, the normal personality class was not always at lowest risk of disorder. Rather, the externalising class, while more likely than the normal personality class to develop substance use disorders, were less likely to develop PTSD and depression. In terms of non-psychiatric outcomes, <b>internalisers</b> reported poorer health and higher levels of life stress and trauma exposure in the year after injury, while externalisers were {{more likely to engage in}} activities that put them at risk of re-injury. These relationships, however, were largely accounted for by gender and the experience of pain at 12 months post-injury. Conclusions: Results suggest that personality is an important mechanism in influencing the development and form of psychopathology and related outcomes after trauma. These findings suggest that screening and early intervention using a personality-based approach may be an effective method of predicting and subsequently preventing much of the burden of posttraumatic problems across both mental health and related domains.

40|$|Kunnskap om barn og barnevernfaglige tekster viser oss at det er stor variasjon i hvordan barn synliggjøres i tekster. Det meldes også om behov for kunnskap om barneverntjenestens hjelpetiltak og hvilken funksjon de har. I den forbindelse trengs det mer kunnskap om de barn som mottar hjelpetiltak. Et tema som jeg i denne studien vil belyse nærmere. Med enkeltvedtak som empirisk analysemateriale undersøker jeg hvordan barn som får hjelpetiltak fremstilles i barneverntjenestens enkeltvedtak. Beskrivelser av barn fremheves og det søkes mot en utvidet fremstilling av barnet. Formålet med studien er å se nærmere på hva dette kan fortelle om hvilken forståelse av barn barneverntjenesten konstruerer frem ved innvilgelse av hjelpetiltak. Teorigrunnlaget for analysen knyttes til sosial konstruktivisme, inspirert av Ian Hacking (1999) sin forståelse, samt Peter Berger og Thomas Luckmann (2000) sine begreper om eksternalisering, objektivering og <b>internalisering.</b> Hensikten er å belyse hvordan disse begrepene kan illustrere kompleksiteten ved et enkeltvedtak som produseres innenfor en bestemt kontekst, en bestemt tid, en bestemt person og med en bestemt hensikt. Videre fremheves utviklingspsykologien som sentralt for hvordan barn forstås. Det empiriske materialet for studien, tekstene, analyseres ved bruk av en narrativ tilnærming. Som analysestrategi og for å belyse problemstillingen benyttes Christopher Hall (1997) sitt begrep om narrativt puslespill. Studien baserer seg på 20 ulike enkeltvedtak for aldersgruppen 0 - 6 år. Analysen er delt inn i to deler. Første del ser på beskrivelser av barn alene ved bruk av tre ulike kategorier. Kategoriene beskrives som barns handlinger, barns emosjonelle uttrykk og barns utvikling. Andre del baserer seg videre på første del, men da i lys av hvordan en utvidet fremstilling og forståelse av barnet skaper nye kategorier. Analysen har vist hvordan fremstillingen og forståelsen av barn får en annen og utvidet dimensjon når det søkes etter tekstens {{narrative}} puslespill. Det tenderer til at barns handlinger knyttes til barnets livssituasjon, at voksnes ansvar for barnets psykiske helse fremheves ved beskrivelser av barns emosjonelle uttrykk, og at barns utviklingsvansker utgjør et varsel og et ekstra krav fra foreldrene. Knowledge {{about children}} and child welfare in academic texts show large variations in {{to what extent}} children are made visible in texts. There has been reported a need for knowledge about how Child Welfare Services can help and what functions they fulfill. Hence, more knowledge about the children receiving help measures is needed. A topic I will investigate in this study. Individual decisions form the empirical material for analysis {{in order to examine}} how children receiving help are depicted in these. Descriptions of children are emphasized, and there is a search towards an extended presentation of the child. The aim of the study is to look closer at what information this reveals about what kind of understanding of children Child Welfare Services construct by granting help measures. The theoretical foundation of the analysis is linked to social constructivism inspired by Ian Hacking’s (1999) understanding, together with Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann’s (2000) concepts about externalization, objectification and internalization. The object is to shed light on how these concepts illustrate the complexity of individual decisions produced within a certain context, a certain time and with a certain intention. Furthermore, developmental psychology is emphasized as a central aspect in understanding children. The texts forming the empirical material are analyzed using a narrative approach. Christopher Hall’s (1997) concept of the narrative puzzle is used as a strategy of analysis in order to shed light on the thesis statement. The study is based on 20 different individual decisions for children aged 0 - 6. The analysis is divided into two parts. Part 1 looks at descriptions of children alone using three different categories. The categories are described as children’s action, children’s emotional expressions and children’s development. Part 2 is based on Part 1, but focuses on how an expanded presentation and understanding of the child leads to new categories. The analysis has showed how the depiction and understanding of children get a different and enlarged dimension when looking at the narrative puzzles in the texts. There are tendencies showing that children’s actions can be linked to the child’s circumstances of life, that the adults’ responsibility for the mental health of the child is emphasized by descriptions of children’s emotional expressions, and that children’s developmental problems form a warning and an additional demand from the parents.
