2500|$|The ending -ayim {{indicates}} the dual in Hebrew, thus {{leading to the}} suggestion that the name refers to the two hills on which the city sits. However, the pronunciation of the last syllable as -ayim appears to be a late development, which had not yet appeared {{at the time of the}} Septuagint. In fact, in the unvocalized Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible the yod that would be required for the -ayim ending (so that it would be written , as in post-biblical Hebrew, rather than [...] ) is almost always absent. It is only the much later vocalization, with the vowel marks for a and <b>i</b> <b>squeezed</b> together between the lamed and the mem, that provides the basis for this reading.|$|E

60|$|Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all {{the morning}} long; <b>I</b> <b>squeezed</b> that sperm till I myself almost melted into it; <b>I</b> <b>squeezed</b> that sperm till a strange sort of {{insanity}} came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers' hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, {{and looking up}} into their eyes sentimentally; as much as to say,--Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness.|$|E
60|$|I trembled so {{that the}} {{revolver}} wabbled in my hand. Trying to hold it steadied, <b>I</b> <b>squeezed</b> it hard. Bang! It went off with a bellow like a cannon. The bullet scattered the gravel near Greaser. His yellow face turned a dirty white. He jumped straight up in his fright.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>squeezed</b> myself {{against the}} wall and looked down upon the never-ending procession. The street was {{continually}} blocked with motor cars and taxicabs. On {{the other side of the}} way streams of people were moving all the time. I recognized many acquaintances even in those few minutes. And then suddenly I saw the gray motor car. I held out my hand to Mr. Bundercombe.|$|E
5000|$|Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964, {{was said}} to have famously remarked, [...] " [...] Berlin is the {{testicles}} of the West. When I want to make the West scream, <b>I</b> <b>squeeze</b> Berlin!" ...|$|R

60|$|Byfield himself, bending {{from the}} car beneath his gently swaying canopy of liver-colour and pale blue, {{directed}} the proceedings with a mien of saturnine preoccupation. He may have been calculating the receipts. As <b>I</b> <b>squeezed</b> to the front, his underlings were shifting the pipe which conveyed the hydrogen gas, and the Lunardi strained gently at its ropes. Somebody with a playful thrust sent me staggering into the clear space beneath.|$|E
60|$|Lop-Ear got married. It was {{the second}} winter after our adventure-journey, and it was most unexpected. He gave me no warning. The first I knew was one {{twilight}} when I climbed the cliff to our cave. <b>I</b> <b>squeezed</b> into the entrance and there I stopped. There {{was no room for}} me. Lop-Ear and his mate were in possession, and she was none other than my sister, the daughter of my step-father, the Chatterer.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to save him from the dance of death," [...] I replied, [...] "enemy or no enemy," [...] and <b>I</b> <b>squeezed</b> the trigger. At the report, the two Band-lu lunged forward upon their faces. I handed my rifle to Ajor, and drawing my pistol, stepped out {{in full view of}} the startled party. The Band-lu did not run away as had some of the lower orders of Caspakians at the sound of the rifle. Instead, the moment they saw me, they let out a series of demoniac war-cries, and raising their spears above their heads, charged me.|$|E

The song is the second single to be {{released}} from Morrissey's 2009 album Years of Refusal.

5000|$|Jasper {{very quickly}} wears out his warm welcome, {{proving to be}} an unscrupulous cad who had been saved from marrying a rich but unattractive woman in Capri by his {{unexpected}} windfall. He is attracted to Serena McGluskey, a beautiful young widow who has just returned to Rathbarney {{following the death of}} her husband. Jasper confides his plan to Serena, [...] "Once <b>I</b> <b>squeeze</b> the lemon dry, I'm off." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{had hoped}} {{so much from}} that first meeting--and where were my hopes now? A profane wish that I had never been born was finding its way into my mind, when {{the door of the}} room was opened softly, {{from the side of the}} passage. Maria, dear Maria, the best friend I have, peeped in. She whispered: [...] "Go into the garden, miss, and you will find {{somebody}} there who is dying to see you. Mind you let him out by the shrubbery gate." [...] <b>I</b> <b>squeezed</b> her hand; I asked if she had tried the shrubbery gate with a sweetheart of her own. [...] "Hundreds of times, miss." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{even as he}} spoke, I was {{leveling}} {{my rifle}} upon the great brute below; and as he ceased speaking, <b>I</b> <b>squeezed</b> the trigger. My bullet must have struck to a hair {{the point at which}} I had aimed, for it smashed the brute's spine back of his shoulders and tore on through his heart, dropping him dead in his tracks. For a moment the women were as terrified by the report of the rifle as they had been by the menace of the lion; but when they saw that the loud noise had evidently destroyed their enemy, they came creeping cautiously back to examine the carcass.|$|E
60|$|Guert made no answer, but I {{could see}} he was profoundly affected. <b>I</b> <b>squeezed</b> his hand, and we parted, in the full hope, on my side at least, that the {{separation}} would be short. I have reason to think Guert shed tears; for, on looking back, I perceived his face turned away from those who were nearest to him. I had but a single glance at Jaap. My fellow stood a little in the rear, as became his colour; but he watched my countenance with the vigilance of a cat. I thought it best not to speak to him, though I gave him a secret sign of encouragement.|$|E
60|$|RIDGEON. I cant. I'm at my limit. <b>I</b> can <b>squeeze</b> in {{one more}} case, but not two. I must choose.|$|R

60|$|I {{set to work}} moving all {{the cases}} out from the wall, and Duroc, gaining new hope from my courage, helped me with all his strength. It was no light task, {{for many of them}} were large and heavy. On we went, working like maniacs, {{slinging}} barrels, cheeses, and boxes pell-mell {{into the middle of the}} room. At last there only remained one huge barrel of vodka, which stood in the corner. With our united strength we rolled it out, and there was a little low wooden door in the wainscot behind it. The key fitted, and with a cry of delight we saw it swing open before us. With the lamp in my hand, <b>I</b> <b>squeezed</b> my way in, followed by my companion.|$|E
60|$|A worldly little devil was mother's {{usual name}} for me. Whether I cried for that I {{was in the}} dark, or for that it was cold, or for that I was hungry, or whether <b>I</b> <b>squeezed</b> myself into a warm corner {{when there was a}} fire, or ate voraciously when there was food, she would still say, 'O, you worldly little devil!' And the sting of it was, that I quite well knew myself to be a worldly little devil. Worldly as to wanting to be housed and warmed, worldly as to wanting to be fed, worldly as to the greed with which I {{inwardly}} compared how much I got of those good things with how much father and mother got, when, rarely, those good things were going.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I turned aside {{with one}} blow the chair he hurled {{at me in}} his terror, and closed with him; and with a heavy crash we rolled upon the floor together. 'It was a fine {{struggle}} that; for he was a tall, strong man, fighting for his life; and I, a powerful madman, thirsting to destroy him. I knew no strength could equal mine, and I was right. Right again, though a madman! His struggles grew fainter. I knelt upon his chest, and clasped his brawny throat firmly with both hands. His face grew purple; his eyes were starting from his head, and with protruded tongue, he seemed to mock me. <b>I</b> <b>squeezed</b> the tighter. 'The door was suddenly burst open with a loud noise, and {{a crowd of people}} rushed forward, crying aloud to each other to secure the madman.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{seem like}} open-work," [...] remarked the boy, gazing intently. [...] "If <b>I</b> should <b>squeeze</b> one, there wouldn't be {{anything}} left of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ow! It was a tight 'ole. <b>I</b> was <b>squeezed</b> till <b>I</b> thought I'd bloomin' well bust," [...] said Ortheris, {{rubbing his}} stomach meditatively, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me see," [...] said Ricker, thoughtfully. [...] "So many engagements! Wait! <b>I</b> could <b>squeeze</b> {{your dinner}} {{in some time}} next month, Hubbard." ...|$|R
6000|$|Up to this, I'd kept my seat {{as well as}} the best, for we'd {{only been}} {{trotting}} gently about the field until the dogs found; and I managed to stick on very well; but directly the tow-rowing began, off went Trumpeter like a thunderbolt, and I found myself playing among the dogs like the donkey among the chickens. [...] "Back, Mr. Coxe," [...] holloas the huntsman; and so I pulled very hard, and cried out, [...] "Wo!" [...] but he wouldn't; and on I went galloping for the dear life. How I kept on is a wonder; but <b>I</b> <b>squeezed</b> my knees in very tight, and shoved my feet very hard into the stirrups, and kept stiff hold of the scruff of Trumpeter's neck, and looked betwixt his ears as well as ever I could, and trusted to luck: for I was in a mortal fright, sure enough, as many a better man would be in such a case, let alone a poor hairdresser.|$|E
60|$|We shuffled by turn, {{next to the}} pan, {{and leaned}} back so that our wrists were fairly in the water. The water {{relieved}} the pain, and I could feel the thongs give a little, {{but it was only}} a little; they had been tied too carefully and well to render it possible to unloose them. We came to this conclusion after an hour's straining, and at the cost of no little pain. We agreed it was no use, and sat thinking over what was the next thing to do, and taking it by turns to cool our wrists. We did not altogether give up hope, as we agreed that we must try, in the short intervals between the visits of the Mexicans, to untie the knots of each other's cords with our teeth. It was possible, anyhow, for the knots would draw pretty easy now that the leather was wet. Suddenly an idea struck me. <b>I</b> <b>squeezed</b> myself back to the wall, and leaned against it.|$|E
60|$|My irons were slipped, and <b>I</b> <b>squeezed</b> myself {{between the}} gun and {{the side of the}} port, where I hung by my hands, against the ship's side. I might be seen, or I might not, caring little for the result. I was not seen by any but Marble and Neb, the former of whom caught me by the legs, as he passed beneath, and {{whispering}} to me to lie down {{in the bottom of the}} boat, he assisted me into the cutter. We actually rubbed against the captain's gig, as it was hauling up to the gangway; but no one suspected what had just taken place. This gig was the only one of the Speedy's boats that was in the water, at that hour, it having just been lowered to carry the captain ashore. In another minute we had dropped astern, Neb holding on by a boat-hook to one of the rudder-chains. Here we lay, until the gig pulled round, close to us, taking the direction toward the usual landing, with the captain of the Speedy in her.|$|E
