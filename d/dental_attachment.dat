40|$|In this {{scientific}} work was performed the extended study of hypersensitive teeth on {{patients with chronic}} periodontitis in order to evaluate the frequency of this painful condition {{and the intensity of}} provoked pain, its dependency on individual′s age, sex, nutrition and oral hygiene habits, extent of tooth mobility and <b>dental</b> <b>attachment</b> loss, amount of the plaque on tooth surfaces, professional oral hygiene, surgical treatment of chronic periodontitis; to examine the structure of dental pulp and hard tissue of hypersensitive teeth, to assess the effectiveness and possibility of treatment using a new generation desensitizing materials. It was determined that the prevalence of teeth hypersensitivity and the pain intensity among the patients with chronic periodontitis is high and directly dependent on individual′s nutrition, oral hygiene habits, age, the extent of tooth mobility and <b>dental</b> <b>attachment</b> loss; professional oral hygiene and surgical treatment significantly increases the pain intensity of hypersensitive teeth; were not found any structural changes in the pulp, hard tissues and myelinated nerve fibres of hypersensitive teeth; new generation desensitizing materials ensure fast, effective and long-lasting reduction of pain intensity...|$|E
40|$|European Russia {{has been}} the source of many procolophonoid taxa from both the Permian and Triassic, and a Permian or− igin for the procolophonoid family Procolophonidae has been based on the Russian taxon Microphon exiguus. Recently, this taxon was {{reclassified}} as a seymouriamorph and, in its place, the taxa Nyctiphruretus, Suchonosaurus, and Kinelia from the Middle and Upper Permian of Russia were suggested as “procolophons”, using evolutionary−systematic classifi− cation methods. In recent phylogenies, however, Nyctiphruretus has been recovered as a non–procolophonoid para− reptile, whereas Kinelia and Suchonosaurus have never been included in a phylogenetic study. Re−examination indicates that Suchonosaurus {{is a member of the}} procolophonoid subfamily Procolophonidae based on the shape of the maxillary bone and the external naris, the laterally visible maxillary depression, and the number and type of maxillary teeth. Kinelia, on the other hand, is excluded from the Procolophonoidea because of its subpleurodont <b>dental</b> <b>attachment</b> and lack of any procolophonoid features. Thus, Suchonosaurus is the only confirmed Permian procolophonid from the Permian of Rus− sia. Additionally, re−examination of the holotype of Microphon exiguus confirms that it is identical to the seymouria− morph specimens recently included in the genus Microphon and that it lacks procolophonoid features. The earliest un− equivocal record of the subfamily Procolophonidae is confirmed from the Late Permian of Russia, making Russia the only region where, with certainty, both Permian and Triassic procolophonids have been discovered...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, due to fast dental progress, {{planning}} of partial dentures is continuously improving, permitting application of contemporary and modern retention systems. Because {{of the presence}} of many different <b>dental</b> <b>attachments</b> on the market, the decision which one to use for each particular case is a big challenge for the dentist. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the advantages and disadvantages of extra-coronal frictional attachments with plastic matrices and to present a critical review for 2 types of retention systems. We used 2 types of extra-coronal frictional attachments with plastic matrices: the AcryLock attachments and the Vario-Soft 3 attachments. The results confirm that AcryLock and Vario-Soft 3 represent similar systems. They insure good retention, with an additional option for dosed retention by using different plastic matrices depending on each particular case. Although these attachments with plastic parts are not newest innovation, they have a big value due to their characteristics - durability, affordable price and possibility for easy and simple maintenance, offering a chance to replace the plastic part if necessary. They insure high quality and long lasting dental prosthodontic appliances that can be used in many different situations. Keywords: Extra-Coronal Attachments; AcryLock; Vario-Soft 3...|$|R

40|$|Background: The alar ligaments are {{integral}} to limiting occipito-atlanto-axial rotation and lateral flexion and enhancing craniocervical stability. Clinical testing of these ligaments is advocated {{prior to the}} application of some cervical spine manual therapy procedures. Given the absence of validation of these tests and the potential consequences if manipulation is applied to an unstable upper cervical spine segment, exploration of these tests is necessary. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the direct effect of the side-bending and rotation stress tests on alar ligaments using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Design: This was a within-participant experimental study. Methods: Sixteen participants underwent MRI in neutral and end-range stress test positions using proton density-weighted sequences in a 3 -Tesla system. Measurements followed a standardized protocol relative to the position of the axis. Distances were measured from dens tip to the inferior margin of the foramen magnum and from midsubstance of the <b>dental</b> <b>attachment</b> of the ligament to its occipital insertion. Between-side differences were calculated for each measurement to account for inherent asymmetries in morphology. Differences were compared between the test and neutral positions using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: Side-bending stress tests produced a median between-side difference in ligament length of + 1. 15 mm. Rotation stress tests produced a median between-side difference in ligament length of + 2. 08 mm. Both results indicate increased measurement of the contralateral alar ligament. Limitations: Assessment could be made only in the neutral position due to imaging limitations. Clinical texts state that tests should be performed in 3 positions: neutral, flexion, and extension. Conclusions: Both side-bending and rotation stress testing result in a measurable increase in length of the contralateral alar ligament. This finding is consistent with mechanisms that have been described to support their use in clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|Objective. We {{assessed}} the orofacial involvement in JDM, and evaluated the possible association of gingival and mandibular mobility alterations with demographic data, periodontal indices, clinical features, muscle enzyme levels, JDM scores and treatment. Methods. Twenty-six JDM patients were studied and compared with 22 healthy controls. Orofacial evaluation included clinical features, dental and periodontal assessment, mandibular function and salivary flow. Results. The mean current age was similar {{in patients with}} JDM and controls (P > 0. 05). A unique gingival alteration characterized by erythema, capillary dilation and bush-loop formation was observed only in JDM patients (61 vs 0 %, P = 0. 0001). The frequencies of altered mandibular mobility and reduced mouth opening were significantly higher in patients with JDM vs controls (50 vs 14 %, P = 0. 013; 31 vs 0 %, P = 0. 005). Comparison of the patients with and without gingival alteration showed that the former had lower values of median of cementoenamel junction (- 0. 26 vs - 0. 06 mm, P = 0. 013) and higher gingival bleeding index (27. 7 vs 14 %, P = 0. 046). This pattern of gingival alteration {{was not associated with}} periodontal disease [plaque index (P = 0. 332) and <b>dental</b> <b>attachment</b> loss (P = 0. 482) ]. The medians for skin DAS and current dose of MTX were higher in JDM with gingival alteration (2. 5 vs 0. 5, P = 0. 029; 28. 7 vs 15, P = 0. 012). A significant association of lower median manual muscle testing with a reduced ability to open the mouth was observed in patients with JDM than those without this alteration (79 vs 80, P = 0. 002). Conclusions. The unique gingival pattern associated with cutaneous disease activity, distinct from periodontal disease, suggests that gingiva is a possible target tissue for JDM. In addition, muscle weakness may be a relevant factor for mandibular mobility.

40|$|Objetivo: Avaliar o comprometimento {{orofacial}} em dermatomiosite juvenil (DMJ). Métodos: Vinte e seis pacientes com DMJ foram estudados e comparados a 22 controles saudáveis. A avaliação orofacial incluiu: características clínicas, avaliação dentária e periodontal, função mandibular e fluxo salivar. Também foram avaliadas as características clínicas e scores da DMJ, enzimas musculares e tratamento. Resultados: A média da idade atual foi similar em pacientes e controles (p> 0. 05). Uma alteração gengival específica, caracterizada por eritema, dilatação de capilares e formação em arbustos foi observado somente em pacientes com DMJ (61 % vs. 0 %, p= 0, 0001). As freqüências de mobilidade mandibular alterada e abertura de boca diminuída foram significativamente maiores em DMJ versus controles (50 % vs. 14 %, p= 0, 013; 31 % vs. 0, p= 0, 005). Comparando pacientes com DMJ com e sem alteração gengival específica, observamos que os pacientes sem alteração gengival apresentaram menores valores de limite esmalte-cemento (- 0. 26 vs. - 0. 006 mm, p= 0, 013) e maior índice de sangramento gengival (27. 7 % vs. 14 %, p= 0, 046). Este padrão de alteração gengival não foi associado à doença periodontal [índice de placa (p= 0, 332) e perda de inserção dentária (p= 0, 482) ]. A mediana do índice disease activity score(DAS) cutâneo e a dose atual de metotrexate foi maior nos pacientes com alteração gengival (2, 5 vs. 0, 5, p= 0, 029; 28. 7 vs. 15, p= 0. 012). Pacientes com DMJ e limitaçao de abertura de boca apresentaram mediana significativamente menor do manual muscle testing(MMT) quando comparados a pacientes com DMJ sem limitação de abertura de boca (79 vs. 80, p= 0. 002). Conclusão: O padrão gengival característico, associado à atividade cutânea da doença, e diferente de doença periodontal, sugere que a gengiva seja um possível tecido alvo para DMJ. Além disto, fraqueza muscular pode ser um fator relevante para a mobilidade mandibular. Objective: To assess orofacial {{involvement in}} juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM).

40|$|Streptococcus mutans is {{considered}} to be the major etiologic agent of human <b>dental</b> caries. <b>Attachment</b> of S. mutans to the tooth surface is required for the development of caries and is mediated, in part, by the 185 -kDa surface protein variously known as antigen I/II, PAc, and P 1. Such proteins are expressed by nearly all species of oral streptococci. Characteristics of P 1 include an alanine-rich repeat region and a centrally located proline-rich repeat region. The proline-rich region of P 1 {{has been shown to be}} important for the translational stability and translocation of P 1 through the bacterial membrane. We show here that (i) several anti-P 1 monoclonal antibodies require the simultaneous presence of the alanine-rich and proline-rich regions for binding, (ii) the proline-rich region of P 1 interacts with the alanine-rich region, (iii) like the proline-rich region, the alanine-rich region is required for the stability and translocation of P 1, (iv) both the proline-rich and alanine-rich regions are required for secretion of P 1 in Escherichia coli, and (v) in E. coli, P 1 is secreted in the absence of SecB...|$|R

Interestingly, cell proliferation on silicone was hampered, because dental cells grew in non-attached spheroid cell clusters. This formation of spheroid cell clusters reminds on the neurogenic differentiation of DFCs [16 - 18]. The proliferation of DFCs on SB and AP was better than that of dNC-PCs, because the attachment of DFCs on these materials was {{lower than that of}} dNC-PCs.

Our results for bone substitute materials are comparable to that of previous studies with different dental cell types.

In another study, PDL cells adhere and proliferate on chitosan or on a combination of chitosan and nanostructured HAP [20]. In this setting, the combination of chitosan and nanostructured HAP was even favored by PDL cells. The adhesion and proliferation of dental pulp derived cells on HAP was demonstrated by Abe et al.

40|$|PM 2000 is a {{ferritic}} alloy obtained by powder metallurgy {{and is being}} investigated for potential applications as a biomaterial. This work aimed to assess the biological compatibility and to {{determine the influence of}} the processing route and further recrystallisation treatment on the magnetic behaviour. The magnetic behaviour has been analysed {{as a function of the}} hysteresis loop obtained by using an inductive method. The biocompatibility has been tested using human osteoblast-like cells seeded onto discs of PM 2000. The ability of cells, on its surface, to attach, grow, and produce alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was determined. It is shown that PM 2000 is a soft magnetic material irrespective of its material condition, its remanent magnetisation being very low (up to about 3 % for the recrystallised swaged material). Fields close to 200 Oe are required to saturate the material. The saturation magnetisation is about 135 emu g- 1. In vitro tests indicate that cells are able to attach and grow onto its surface, and produce ALP, a specific marker of cells with bone-forming activity. In this respect, PM 2000 holds promise as a suitable substrate for bone integration. These properties could make PM 2000 a useful candidate for the preparation of medical devices where biocompatible and soft magnetic materials are sought.

40|$|The {{adhesion}} of pathogenic {{bacteria to}} the host surface is an essential step {{in the development of}} numerous infections, including <b>dental</b> caries. <b>Attachment</b> of Streptococcus mutans, the main etiological agent of human dental caries, to the tooth surface may be mediated by glucan synthesized by glucosyltransferase (GTF) and by cell surface proteins, such as P 1, which bind to salivary receptors. Fimbriae on the surfaces of many microorganisms are known to function in bacterial adhesion. Previous studies in this laboratory have initially characterized the fibrillar surface of S. mutans. The purpose of this investigation was the comparison of the antigenic properties of fimbria preparations of S. mutans isolates from five caries-resistant (CR) and six caries-susceptible (CS) subjects. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of S. mutans fimbrial preparations revealed five major protein bands at 200, 175, 157, 86, and 66 kDa in preparations from CR and CS subjects. Immunoblot analysis indicated the presence of the same major bands recognized by anti-S. mutans fimbria antisera. Furthermore, the 175 - and 157 -kDa bands were recognized by antibodies to P 1 and GTF, respectively. Immunoblot analysis with antisera to the fimbria preparation, to P 1, or to GTF indicated that the levels of fimbria-reactive components and P 1 and GTF antigens were higher in S. mutans fimbria preparations from CS subjects than in those from CR individuals. For example, four of six fimbria preparations from CS patients had demonstrable P 1, and all had GTF. In contrast, only two of five CR fimbrial preparations exhibited P 1 and GTF. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated similar results for levels of GTF antigen in the fimbrial preparations from CR and CS subjects. The results suggest that differences between the compositions of S. mutans fimbriae in CR and CS individuals may {{play an important role in}} the virulence of this microorganism in dental caries...|$|R
