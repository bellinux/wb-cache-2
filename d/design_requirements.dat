5|$|Concorde {{needed to}} fly long {{distances}} to be economically viable; this required high efficiency from the powerplant. Turbofan engines were rejected {{due to their}} larger cross-section producing excessive drag. Olympus turbojet technology was available to be developed to meet the <b>design</b> <b>requirements</b> of the aircraft, although turbofans would be studied for any future SST.|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 1946, Boeing's Model 462, a straight-wing {{aircraft}} {{powered by}} six Wright T35 turboprops with a gross weight of 360,000pounds (160,000kg) and a combat radius of 3,110miles (2,700nmi, 5,010km), was declared the winner. On 28 June 1946, Boeing was issued {{a letter of}} contract for US$1.7million to build a full-scale mock-up of the new XB-52 and do preliminary engineering and testing. However, by October 1946, the air force began to express concern about {{the sheer size of}} the new aircraft and its inability to meet the specified <b>design</b> <b>requirements.</b> In response, Boeing produced Model 464, a smaller four-engine version with a 230,000pound (105,000kg) gross weight, which was briefly deemed acceptable.|$|E
5|$|The {{changes to}} the DDL design {{reflected}} shifting requirements and poor project management by the Navy. The development of an Australian-designed ship customised for Australian conditions caused naval officers to include requirements beyond those which were essential. These changes were made without regard for costs, as the team tasked with developing the specifications was not also responsible for the ships' final price and delivery schedule. The Navy's failure to maintain control of the <b>design</b> <b>requirements</b> and make cost-performance trade-offs {{may have been due}} to its limited experience in overseeing the design of new warships.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the engineering <b>design</b> <b>requirement</b> and the process by which it is elicited, evolved and recorded. The purpose of the research reported in the work is to achieve a more complete understanding of the engineering <b>design</b> <b>requirement,</b> and to apply that understanding to the better support of designers during the <b>design</b> <b>requirement</b> capture phases of the design process. Two perspectives dominate the approach to the research. The first concerns the relation between the design process and human cognition. The research subject is seen as being fundamentally a product of the human mind and that such things as knowledge, language and meaning – the things commonly associated with cognition – are crucial to its proper understanding. The second perspective is informed by the view that the development of the <b>design</b> <b>requirement</b> {{can be seen as a}} knowledge-intensive process of communication. Thus, understanding communication between humans and some aspects of communication failure can assist in understanding and remedying failure in <b>design</b> <b>requirement</b> capture.

5|$|In October 1908, the Artillery Committee met to {{make its}} {{recommendations}} to the Junta Superior. The Committee concluded the SECN and Schneider proposals were superior to the Ansaldo version, but neither had a marked advantage over the other. The following month, the Naval Construction Committee met to evaluate the proposals. It recommended the SECN design first, followed by Schneider, with Ansaldo last. The Office of the Navy Controller also evaluated the proposals in November, and advised the Junta Superior that only the SECN bid met the <b>design</b> <b>requirements</b> without any legal, administrative, or cost problems. In February 1909, the Navy requested a revised design from SECN to incorporate several alterations, including an increased freeboard to improve seakeeping, an increased height and length of the main belt armor, {{and the addition of}} individual rangefinders for each gun turret. SECN agreed to make the changes on 20 March, and the company received the contract on 14 April. Due to the constraints imposed by the Spanish economy, the resulting design produced the smallest dreadnought-type battleships ever built. They were also obsolescent before completion due to rapid technological changemost significantly the rise of the superdreadnought battleshipsand lengthy delays in completion of the later units of the class.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The <b>design</b> <b>requirement</b> is a {{description}} of the desired solution to a problem. In engineering design, as in all other, a clear expression of a well-formulated design goal is vital for successful and e cient completion of the design task. The nature of the <b>design</b> <b>requirement</b> and the processes by which it is achieved {{have been the subject of}} a wide variety of research. The purpose of the paper is twofold. Firstly, it sets out to collate and discuss representative research in this area in order to give an overview of the current scope of the work. Secondly, it seeks to draw a comparison with the task of developing the <b>design</b> <b>requirement</b> for software and information systems and to initiate a discussion that considers to what extent the substantial body of research in software requirements engineering might help to give an understanding of the <b>design</b> <b>requirement</b> for the engineering design domain. A tentative characterization of the diVerences between the tasks in the two domains is presented, and representative papers from requirements engineering are used to suggest areas of overlap as a starting point for further investigation...|$|R

25|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that intermodulation distortion is not present in the live audio and so it represents an artificial coloration to the live sound.
