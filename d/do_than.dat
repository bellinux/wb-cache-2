The transporter bridge operates {{very much like a}} ferry and during the lengthy crossing taxi drivers usually have nothing much else to <b>do</b> <b>than</b> to talk to their passenger(s).|$|E

25|$|In Europe, woodcut is {{the oldest}} {{technique}} used for old master prints, developing about 1400, by using on paper existing techniques for printing on cloth. The explosion of sales of cheap woodcuts {{in the middle of}} the century led to a fall in standards, and many popular prints were very crude. The development of hatching followed on rather later than in engraving. Michael Wolgemut was significant in making German woodcut more sophisticated from about 1475, and Erhard Reuwich was the first to use cross-hatching (far harder to <b>do</b> <b>than</b> in engraving or etching). Both of these produced mainly book-illustrations, as did various Italian artists who were also raising standards there at the same period. At the end of the century Albrecht Dürer brought the Western woodcut to a level that has never been surpassed, and greatly increased the status of the single-leaf (i.e. an image sold separately) woodcut.|$|E

500|$|During the sixties, Kraft was a {{household}} name in America. He appeared {{on the cover of}} the August 27, 1965 issue of Time Magazine, in which he was profiled as the [...] "Conductor in a Command Post". In his interview with Time, Kraft compared himself with namesake Christopher Columbus, displaying what the magazine described as [...] "an almost angry pride" [...] in his work. [...] "We know a lot more about what we have to <b>do</b> <b>than</b> he did," [...] Kraft said. [...] "And we know where we're going." [...] The article described Kraft's role in the Gemini 5 mission, and drew on Kraft's frequent comparisons of his position as flight director with that of an orchestra conductor.|$|E
500|$|Following an {{appearance}} {{in an online}} video on feminism, entitled My Choice, {{under the direction of}} Homi Adajania, Padukone took on the role of a headstrong Bengali architect who cares for her hypochondriac father (played by Amitabh Bachchan), in Shoojit Sircar's comedy-drama Piku (2015). Reviews for the film were positive; Tanmaya Nanda of Business Standard praised the film's feminist tone, and wrote that Padukone proves [...] "what she is capable of when given something more to <b>do</b> <b>than</b> look pretty and be the crazy-dance girl at parties". NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee opined that she [...] "holds Piku together with a restrained star turn". With a worldwide gross of over , the film emerged as a box office hit, and garnered Padukone several awards, including second Best Actress awards at Filmfare and Screen.|$|E
500|$|Modelling atomic {{behaviour}} under incident {{electromagnetic radiation}} using [...] "virtual oscillators" [...] at the absorption and emission frequencies, {{rather than the}} (different) apparent frequencies of the Bohr orbits, led Max Born, Werner Heisenberg and Kramers to explore different mathematical models. They {{led to the development}} of matrix mechanics, the first form of modern quantum mechanics. The BKS theory also generated discussion of, and renewed attention to, difficulties in the foundations of the old quantum theory. The most provocative element of BKS – that momentum and energy would not necessarily be conserved in each interaction, but only statistically – was soon shown to be in conflict with experiments conducted by Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger. In light of these results, Bohr informed Darwin that [...] "there is nothing else to <b>do</b> <b>than</b> to give our revolutionary efforts as honourable a funeral as possible".|$|E

500|$|Likewise, Beatty said {{he enjoyed}} the actual filming of the episodes but hated the {{television}} business end of it, claiming, [...] "I can't think of anything I would less rather <b>do</b> <b>than</b> television at this moment." [...] He said the process left him [...] "pretty much burnt" [...] and said his enthusiasm for the show had [...] "eroded as time goes on". It was initially reported that Beatty would not return for the second Homicide season at all because he had accepted a starring role in The Boys, a CBS comedy series also featuring Christopher Meloni. Polito {{said he did not}} believe Beatty's departure would hurt the show because of the ensemble nature of the cast: [...] "I love Ned's work, but the show won't fall apart because of one character." [...] Beatty ended up appearing in both shows, and The Boys was canceled after six episodes.|$|E
500|$|In January 1854, Douglas {{introduced}} the Kansas–Nebraska Act {{to organize the}} Nebraska Territory. Southerners had thwarted his previous attempts to organize the territory because Nebraska lay north of parallel 36°30' north, the line separating slave and free territory under the Missouri Compromise. They feared that the territory would be organized into new free states that would vote against the South on slavery issues. The Kansas–Nebraska Act allowed the territory's settlers {{to decide whether or}} not to permit slavery, an implicit repeal of the Missouri Compromise. Kentucky Senator Archibald Dixon's amendment to make the repeal explicit angered northern Democrats, but Breckinridge believed it would move the slavery issue from national to local politics, and he urged Pierce to support it. Breckinridge wrote to his uncle Robert that he [...] "had more to <b>do</b> <b>than</b> any man here, in putting [...] in its present shape", but Heck notes that few extant records support this claim. The repeal amendment made the act more palatable to the South; only 9 of 58 Southern congressmen voted against it. No Northern Whigs voted for the measure, but 44 of 86 Northern Democrats voted in the affirmative, enough to pass it. The Senate quickly concurred, and Pierce signed the act into law on May 30, 1854.|$|E
500|$|In July 2007, British {{human rights}} lawyer David Enright {{complained to the}} United Kingdom's Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) that he came across the book in the children's section of Borders {{bookshop}} while shopping {{with his wife and}} two sons. The CRE called on bookshops to remove the comic, stating that it contained [...] "hideous racial prejudice" [...] by depicting Congolese who [...] "look like monkeys and talk like imbeciles." [...] Responding that it was committed to letting its [...] "customers make the choice", Borders moved the book to an area reserved for adult graphic novels. UK bookseller Waterstone's followed suit. [...] Another British retailer, WHSmith, said that the book was sold on its website, but with a label that recommended it for readers aged 16 and over. The CRE's attempt to ban the book was criticised by Conservative Party politician Ann Widdecombe, who remarked that the organisation had more important things to <b>do</b> <b>than</b> regulate the availability of historical children's books. The media controversy increased interest in the book, and Borders reported that its sales of Tintin in the Congo had been boosted 4,000%, while it also rose to eighth on the Amazon.com bestseller list. Publisher Egmont UK also responded to racism concerns by placing a protective band around the book with a warning about its content and writing an introduction describing its historical context.|$|E

500|$|For {{the role}} of Edward Bloom, Burton spoke with Jack Nicholson, Spielberg's initial choice for the role. Burton had {{previously}} worked with Nicholson on Batman (1989) and Mars Attacks! (1996). In order to depict Nicholson as the young Bloom, Burton intended to {{use a combination of}} computer-generated imagery and prosthetic makeup. The director then decided to cast around for the two actors in question. Jinks and Cohen, who were then working with Ewan McGregor on Down with Love (2003), suggested that Burton cast both McGregor and Albert Finney for Edward. Burton later compared McGregor's acting style to regular colleague Johnny Depp. Viewing Finney's performance in Tom Jones (1963), Burton found him similar to McGregor, and coincidentally found a People magazine article comparing the two. McGregor, being Scottish, found it easier performing with a Southern American English accent. [...] "It's a much easier accent to <b>do</b> <b>than</b> a standard American accent because you can really hear it. You can get your teeth into it. Standard American is much harder because it's more lyrical." [...] The same dual casting applied to {{the role of}} Bloom's wife, Sandra, who would be played by Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman. Burton commented that he was impressed with Lohman's performance in White Oleander (2002). Burton's girlfriend, Helena Bonham Carter, was also cast in two roles. Her prosthetic makeup for The Witch took five hours to apply. [...] "I was pregnant throughout filming, so it was weird being a pregnant witch," [...] the actress reflected. [...] "I had morning sickness, so all those fumes and the make-up and the rubber...it was hideous." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul Brannigan of Q {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars. He said that the album is [...] "largely characterised by joyous new wave-influenced rock'n'roll, {{and for the first time}} in their 19-year career, Pearl Jam {{actually}} sound—whisper it—fun. No, honestly." [...] Josh Modell of Spin gave the album {{four out of five}} stars. He said, [...] "For the first time in years, Pearl Jam are seizing the moment rather than wallowing in it." [...] Time reviewer Josh Tyrangiel said, [...] "The songs here are built on hooks, covered with guitar fuzz, and then trimmed back a bit so the melody abides." [...] Tyrangiel added, [...] "Nothing revolutionary, but Backspacer provides an adrenaline jolt that shouldn't be underestimated either." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B, saying that Backspacer is [...] "the sort of sweaty rock & roll that belongs in a bar with cracked-leather booths and $2 beers," [...] and that it [...] "grows same-y, but tracks like the surfing-as-life-metaphor anthem 'Amongst the Waves' do indeed make something old feel, if not new, good again." [...] The New York Times said that [...] "Pearl Jam... —mostly—to equate maturity with slowing down," [...] but added, [...] "Pearl Jam's quandary is that with fewer outside targets or frustrations to rail against, it risks turning sanctimonious... Pearl Jam's music doesn't align well with satisfaction." [...] Joshua Love of Pitchfork said that the album [...] "seems to suggest in its tossed-off 37 minutes that Pearl Jam have no greater concern and regard for what they <b>do</b> <b>than</b> the rest of the world can muster," [...] and he added that [...] "with the spotlights long since extinguished, Pearl Jam seem content to do things by the book." ...|$|E
