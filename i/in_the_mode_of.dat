Mario and his simian nemesis appeared on cereal boxes, board games, pajamas, and manga. In 1983, the animation studio Ruby-Spears produced a Donkey Kong cartoon (as well as Donkey Kong Jr.) for the Saturday Supercade program on CBS. In the show, mystery crime-solving plots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> Scooby-Doo are framed around the premise of Mario and Pauline chasing Donkey Kong (voiced by Soupy Sales), who has escaped from the circus. The show lasted two seasons.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no known}} {{morphological}} {{differences between the}} three island populations, but Turvey and colleagues found that animals from Nevis were slightly smaller than those from the two other islands. Such a difference in size {{might be related to}} the fact that Saint Kitts is larger than Nevis, in accordance with the trend that animals become larger on larger islands. However, Turvey and colleagues also observed that their Saint Kitts material consisted of older individuals than those from Nevis; thus, the size difference may result from differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> exploitation by Amerindians.|$|E

The frequency of males in populations is therefore highly variable. In sexual populations, the sperm leave the male's body through simple pores, there being no penis. The eggs are released by the female and then held in the cup-like brood pouch. The eggs are retained by the female only {{for a short time}} before being laid, and the larvae develop directly, without passing through a metamorphosis.|$|E

The dancer bears on his or her head a brass pot filled with uncooked rice, decorated with flowers and surrounded by a bamboo frame, and tumbles and leaps to the rhythm of a song without spilling a grain.

25|$|On the whole, the {{development}} of poetry in the American colonies mirrors {{the development}} of the colonies themselves. The early poetry is dominated by the need to preserve the integrity of the Puritan ideals that created the settlement in the first place. As the colonists grew in confidence, the poetry they wrote increasingly reflected their drive towards independence. This shift in subject matter was not reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> writing which tended to be conservative, to say the least. This {{can be seen as a}} product of the physical remove at which American poets operated from the center of English-language poetic developments in London.|$|E

25|$|The order Notostraca {{comprises}} the single family Triopsidae, containing the tadpole shrimp or shield shrimp. The two genera, Triops and Lepidurus, are considered living fossils, having not changed significantly in outward form since the Triassic. They have a broad, flat carapace, which conceals {{the head and}} bears {{a single pair of}} compound eyes. The abdomen is long, appears to be segmented and bears numerous pairs of flattened legs. The telson is flanked by a pair of long, thin caudal rami. Phenotypic plasticity within taxa makes species-level identification difficult, and is further compounded by variation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> reproduction. Notostracans are omnivores living on the bottom of temporary pools and shallow lakes.|$|E
25|$|Eohippus {{appeared}} in the Ypresian (early Eocene), about 52 mya (million years ago). It was an animal approximately {{the size of a}} fox (250450mm in height), with a relatively short head and neck and a springy, arched back. It had 44 low-crowned teeth, in the typical arrangement of an omnivorous, browsing mammal: three incisors, one canine, four premolars, and three molars {{on each side of the}} jaw. Its molars were uneven, dull, and bumpy, and used primarily for grinding foliage. The cusps of the molars were slightly connected in low crests. Eohippus browsed on soft foliage and fruit, probably scampering between thickets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> a modern muntjac. It had a small brain, and possessed especially small frontal lobes.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Three Represents", {{literally}} a Marxism adapted to Chinese conditions, {{was adopted by}} the party at the 16th National Congress. Certain segments within the CCP criticized the Three Represents as being un-Marxist and a betrayal of basic Marxist values, supporters viewed it as a further development of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Jiang disagreed, and had concluded that attaining the communist mode of production, as formulated by earlier communists, was more complex than had been realized, and that it was useless to try to force a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> production, as it had to develop naturally, by following the economic laws of history.
