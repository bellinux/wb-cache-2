40|$|Abstract: Enzootic {{bovine leucosis}} is an {{infectious}} disease of cattle {{caused by the}} bovine leukemia virus that results in lymphoma within target tissues. Cattle might demonstrate four clinicopathological age-related manifestations of the disease: juvenile, adult, thymic, and cutaneous form. This article describes the unusual manifestation of this disease in a 4 -yr-old cow. Regional lymph nodes were enlarged during clinical examination. Peripheral and internal lymph nodes, {{as well as the}} vagina, uterus, spleen, liver, heart, thoracic vertebrae, eye and the thoracic and abdominal cavities demonstrated lymphoma at necropsy.

40|$|Quality control {{relies heavily}} {{on the use of}} formal {{assessment}} metrics. In this paper, for the context of veterinary epidemiology, we review the main proposals, precision, repeatability, reproducibility, and intermediate precision, in agreement with ISO (international Organization for Standardization) practice, generalize these by placing them within the linear mixed model framework, which we then extend to the generalized linear mixed model setting, so that both Gaussian as well as non-Gaussian data can be employed. Similarities and differences are discussed between the classical ANOVA (analysis of variance) approach and the proposed mixed model settings, on the one hand, and between the Gaussian and non-Gaussian cases, on the other hand. The new proposals are applied to five studies in three diseases: Aujeszky's disease, <b>enzootic</b> bovine <b>leucosis</b> (EBL) and bovine brucellosis.

25|$|The {{government}} had already paid substantial compensation to farmers {{because of the}} foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 followed by the bluetongue outbreak in 2007, {{against the background of}} EC Directives 77/391 and 78/52 on eradication of tuberculosis, brucellosis or <b>enzootic</b> bovine <b>leucosis.</b> In the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak, a total of £1.4 billion in compensation was paid. The Cattle Compensation (England) Order 2006 (SI2006/168) was overturned when the High Court decided the Order was unlawful; in the test case, farmers had been receiving compensation payments of around £1,000 on animals valued at over £3,000, but in extreme cases the discrepancy between animal value and compensation paid was over one thousand percent. This case was itself overturned on appeal in 2009.|$|R
40|$|A novel milk sampler (MilkThief) is described. It {{can collect}} {{representative}} samples of milk {{to be used}} for disease monitoring from groups of cows during a milking session. The maximum dilution of each individual cow¿s milk did not exceed a 1 : 45 limit when we tested the sampler in a range of Australian dairies. Such a dilution limit has been shown by others to be efficient for the detection of <b>enzootic</b> bovine <b>leucosis</b> when the `Lactelisa¿ method is used. The samplers and collection flasks are conveniently left in place for the whole milking session. The sampling volume can be manipulated so that the combined sample collected from up to 10 cows can be held in a flask of 220 -mL capacity. The sampler can be easily fitted to any milking machine...|$|R

40|$|Haematological tests (alfa nafthyl acetate {{esterase}} ANAE activity, May Grünwald Giemsa staining {{and total}} leucocyte counts) {{were applied to}} 469 dairy cows, where the enzootic form of bovine leucosis was investigated. In the same 469 dairy cows, a search for antibodies directed against bovine leucosis virus (BLV) was carried out using agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) in blood samples and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in milk samples. Among the 469 animals screened, 90 were positive by ELISA and the haematological tests, while 23 were positive by the AGID test. From these results we would advise heavily infected farms to be eliminated. ELISA and haematological methods, in which ANAE activity, May-Grünwald Giemsa staining and total leucocyte counts were used together, were more reliable and sensitive than the AGID test for detecting EBL.

40|$|The bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the causative {{agent of}} <b>enzootic</b> bovine <b>leucosis.</b> This study {{investigated}} {{the presence of the}} BLV in leukemia (179 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 292 acute myeloid leukemia and 46 chronic myelogenous leukemia cases) and 162 lung cancer patients (139 adenocarcinoma, 23 squamous cell carcinoma) to determine if the BLV is a causative organism of leukemia and lung cancer in Koreans. A BLV infection was confirmed in human cells by PCR using a BLV- 8 primer combination. All 517 cases of human leukemia and 162 lung cancer were negative for a PCR of the BLV proviral DNA. In conclusion, although meat has been imported from BLV endemic areas, the BLV infection {{does not appear to be}} the cause of human leukemia or lung cancer in Koreans.

40|$|A {{total of}} 535 sera from eight species of {{wildlife}} {{were collected from}} different game areas in Tanzania between 1987 and 1989. These sera were tested for antibodies against foot-and-mouth disease, bovine herpes virus types 1 and 2, lumpy skin disease, bovine viral diarrhoea, Akabane, bovine ephemeral fever, bluetongue, <b>enzootic</b> bovine <b>leucosis,</b> African horse sickness and African swine fever viruses and Brucella abortus based on the expected species susceptibility. Sera from buffalo Syncerus caffer, wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus and topi Damaliscus korrigum contained antibodies against {{the majority of the}} pathogens tested. Antibodies to fewer pathogens were detected in sera from the other species. No antibodies to lumpy skin disease virus were detected in any of the sera examined. African horse sickness antibodies were detected in sera from Zebra and African swine fever antibodies were detected in wart hog. The occurrence of antibodies to these agents suggests that wild species act as reservoirs of infection for some of these pathogens. However, until the susceptibility of individual species is proven by isolation of the aetiological agents their role must remain speculative...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of Swiss surveillance for epizootic diseases, dairy cattle are sampled using bulk tank milk while non-dairy cattle are sampled on the farm. The latter method is costly, time-demanding and dangerous for the personnel. However, slaughterhouses could be an alternative sampling point for this population. To assess the cost-effectiveness and sensitivity of such an approach, surveillance using slaughterhouse sampling was modelled with data from the 2012 Swiss animal movement database (AMD). We simulated a cross-sectional study for bluetongue (BT), and surveillance programmes to substantiate freedom from infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and <b>enzootic</b> bovine <b>leucosis</b> (EBL) (combined) to compare the outcome of random on-farm sampling versus slaughterhouse sampling. We found that, under Swiss conditions, slaughterhouse sampling results in low herd-level sensitivities because animals are sent by owners to slaughter individually and not in large groups, restricting the number of samples per herd. This makes slaughterhouse sampling inappropriate for prevalence surveys at the herd-level. However, for prevalence surveys at the animal-level and for substantiation of freedom from disease, slaughterhouse surveillance is equally or more cost-efficient than on-farm sampling...|$|R
40|$|With a total EU {{expenditure}} of € 880 {{million for the}} period 2007 - 2011, the report shows that good {{progress has been made}} in the majority of EU co-financed veterinary programmes with continuous expansion in disease free zones for Bovine Tuberculosis, Bovine Brucellosis, Bluetongue, <b>Enzootic</b> Bovine <b>Leucosis</b> and Aujeszky's Disease. The implementation of BSE monitoring and eradication programmes led to a dramatic drop in the detected BSE cases within the period. In the case of Rabies, the co-funded oral vaccination programmes have proved very successful as they have led to the steady eradication of Rabies from several Member States. This is unique in the world as the EU has achieved a level of Rabies eradication that has never been experienced anywhere else before. Classical Swine Fever (CSF) in domestic pigs has been eradicated all over Europe. In wild boar, the restricted zones have been lifted due to the proved absence of virus circulation in most of the EU territories. The implementation of Avian Influenza (AI) surveillance programmes has been another success.

40|$|Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is {{a member}} of the Delta retro virus genus (family Retroviridae) and can cause {{persistent}} lymphocytosis and lymphosarcoma in cattle that is described as <b>enzootic</b> bovine <b>leucosis</b> (EBL). This disease causes significant economic losses associated with the costs of control and eradication programs. Control programs of leucosis are based on the screening of cows by serological methods and removing the infected cows. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of bovine leukemia virus in cattle in Khuzestan province. Serum samples from 527 cattle were randomly collected in Ahvaz, Baghmalek, Shooshtar, Gotvand, Shadegan, Hendijan, Behbahan, Ramhormoz and Susangerd cities and were examined by ELISA assay. Seroperevalence rate of bovine leukemia virus was 6. 64 % (95 % CI: 4. 51 - 8. 77). Statistical analysis indicated no significant association between infection and age or breed. Relative frequency of infection was higher in female cows than males, but this difference was not significant and odds of infection in female cows than males were 2. 6 (95 % CI: 0. 35 - 19. 59).

40|$|<b>Enzootic</b> Bovine <b>Leucosis</b> (EBL) {{is one of}} viral {{diseases}} in cattle caused by bovine leukemia virus (BLV), from Retroviridae. The virus can be detected using severals methods such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), while antibody can be detected using Agar Gel Immunodifussion (AGID). The aim of this experiment was to study the effectivity of PCR and AGID methods to detect enzootic bovine leukosis virus in Indonesia. Samples of peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) were collected from cattles those with and without showing clinical signs. A total of 307 blood and serum samples were tested against BLV using PCR and AGID tests, while 21 semen samples which were from similar animals for blood collection were collected only for PCR test. The results indicated that twelve cattles have positive results with PCR test in PBL, but from those cattles only seven were positive with AGID. On the other hand, the PCR did not detect EBL in 21 bovine semen samples tested, although one sample gave positive result with PCR in PBL. This results indicated that PCR method from blood samples was more sensitive than that AGID method. The PCR detection was also more sensitive for PBL than that for semen sample...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{cohort study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the risk of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) transmission to uninfected cattle by adjacent infected cattle in 6 dairy farms. Animals were initially tested in 2010 – 2011 using a commercial ELISA kit. Uninfected cattle were repeatedly tested every 4 to 6 months until fall of 2012. The Cox proportional hazard model with frailty showed that uninfected cattle neighboring to infected cattle (n= 53) had a significant higher risk of seroconversion than those without any infected neighbors (n= 81) (hazard ratio: 12. 4, P= 0. 001), implying that neighboring infected cattle were a significant risk factor for BLV transmission. This finding provides scientific support for animal health authorities and farmers to segregate infected cattle on farms to prevent spread of BLV.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{optimise}} the cost-effectiveness of active surveillance to substantiate freedom from disease, {{a new approach}} using targeted sampling of farms was developed and applied on the example of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and <b>enzootic</b> bovine <b>leucosis</b> (EBL) in Switzerland. Relevant risk factors (RF) for the introduction of IBR and EBL into Swiss cattle farms were identified and their relative risks defined based on literature review and expert opinions. A quantitative model based on the scenario tree method was subsequently {{used to calculate the}} required sample size of a targeted sampling approach (TS) for a given sensitivity. We compared the sample size with that of a stratified random sample (sRS) with regard to efficiency. Results The required sample sizes to substantiate disease freedom were 1, 241 farms for IBR and 1, 750 farms for EBL to detect 0. 2 % herd prevalence with 99 % sensitivity. Using conventional sRS, the required sample sizes were 2, 259 farms for IBR and 2, 243 for EBL. Considering the additional administrative expenses required for the planning of TS, the risk-based approach was still more cost-effective than a sRS (40 % reduction on the full survey costs for IBR and 8 % for EBL) due to the considerable reduction in sample size. Conclusions As the model depends on RF selected through literature review and was parameterised with values estimated by experts, it is subject to some degree of uncertainty. Nevertheless, this approach provides the veterinary authorities with a promising tool for future cost-effective sampling designs. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{presence}} of lymphoma in buffaloes was first reported in India in the 1960 s. The disease {{is similar to}} <b>Enzootic</b> Bovine <b>Leucosis</b> (EBL) caused by Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) in cattle; however, according to our results {{and those of other}} studies, the etiology of these lymphomas in buffalo {{do not appear to be}} associated with BLV. The objectives of this study are to describe four cases of the disease in buffaloes belonging to the same herd in the Amazon region of Brazil and to perform a clinical-anatomopathological, immunohistochemical, and etiological study of the lymphomas. Results Over a period of ten years, four buffaloes were observed presenting progressive weight loss, swelling of peripheral lymph nodes, and nodules in the subcutaneous tissue. Upon necropsy, whitish-colored tumor masses were observed in the form of nodules in the subcutaneous tissue, along with miliary nodules on the serosal surfaces of abdominal and thoracic organs and tumors in lymph nodes and other organs. Neoplastic lymphocyte proliferation was observed through histopathology. An immunohistochemical study revealed that the neoplasias were formed by proliferation of predominantly B lymphocytes. The {{presence of}} BLV genome was not detected in the lymphomas when using the real-time PCR technique, nor was it detected through immunohistochemical staining using monoclonal antibodies against two viral proteins. Bovine herpesvirus 6 was not detected in the tumors. However, Bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) was detected in samples of lymphoma and in the lymph nodes and kidneys of one of the animals. Conclusions The occurrence of lymphoma in buffaloes is reported for the first time in Brazil and is characterized by B-cell multicentric lymphoma. The etiology of the disease does not appear to be associated with BLV; however, the detection of BIV in samples of lymphoma from one sick animal deserves further study, considering the oncogenic potential of this virus...|$|R
40|$|Assessment of {{occurrence}} and diagnostic methods of viral diseases in cattle – viral diarrhoea (BVD), {{infectious bovine rhinotracheitis}} (IBR), rabies, enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL), and spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) – was carried {{out for the first}} time in Lithuania. It was established that viruses of rabies, infectious rhinotraheitis and viral diarrhoea are most widespread in the country. It was determined that occurrence of rabies in cattle is parallel with the infection of wildlife with rabies virus. Analysis of eradication programme of <b>enzootic</b> bovine <b>leucosis</b> was done. It revealed that only combined application of diagnostic and preventive measures allowed reducing the cattle infection up to 0. 2 %. Though bovine spongiform encephalopathy has not been recorded in Lithuania, it is feasible to implement its diagnostic and prevention programme. An overall financial analysis of expenditures on BSE and viral diseases diagnostics and control was for the first time done in Lithuania. It showed that BSE and EBL occupied the leading positions in the structure of expenditures on viral diseases. In 2001, expenditures on BSE investigations accounted for 76. 68 % and in 2004 for 86. 74 % of the total. Expenditures on EBL investigations relatively reduced from 86. 98 % in 2000 to 8. 47 % in 2004. During the time under consideration, expenditures on investigations of other viral diseases changed but little. It was determined that consistent and wide-scale preventive vaccination created preconditions for diagnostic investigations of rabies; preventive vaccination of cattle against BR is applied to 30 thou animals every year. A few hundred are examined on suspicion of infection. The annual expenditures related with IBR and BVD amount up to 45 thou yet in the context of economic unit these expenditures are comparatively low – from 8. 7 to 13. 5 Lt...|$|R
40|$|In {{the rural}} areas of Kwa Zulu Natal small scale farming is the main {{agricultural}} activity, which is often carried out {{in addition to other}} employment taken on in another location by at least one member of the household. Although Veterinary services (VS) was aware of several diseases occurring in this area and has implemented a dipping strategy for tick borne diseases as well as a regional annual vaccination campaign for Rabies, Anthrax and Black quarter, uncertainty remained about the relative importance of other diseases such as brucellosis, leptospirosis and <b>enzootic</b> bovine <b>leucosis.</b> Further it was of interest to investigate the serological resistance of cattle against the tick borne diseases babesiosis and anaplasmosis. In addition to this veterinary services wanted to increase their understanding of the perceptions and practices of local cattle owners that were relevant for the context of disease control. A serological survey of cattle was carried out between March 2001 and December 2003 to determine the prevalence of the above-mentioned diseases. The survey was designed as a two-stage survey, considering the diptank as the primary sampling unit. The conduction of the questionnaire survey was based on a convenience sample and took place during the dipping procedure. The apparent prevalence at district level was adjusted for clustering, and diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity and displayed in maps. The mean true prevalence of brucellosis varied from zero to 15. 8 percent in the north eastern region with the large majority of the districts being disease free. Enzootic Bovine Leukosis (EBL) was widely present in the province at generally low prevalences, except in the central region where the highest prevalence at district level was recorded to be 70 percent. Leptospirosis also occurred frequently with the highest prevalence noted being 62 percent at district level. The southern regions showed a higher leptospirosis prevalence than other areas of the province, while in some of the northern and western districts a lower prevalence is noted. The encountered servovars were pomona, which occurred most frequently, tarrasovi, bratislava, hardjo, canicola and icterohaemorrhagica. While Babesia bovis and anaplasmosis occurred at a high prevalence throughout the province, B. bigemina was found to be much less established and is absent from many of the northern districts. Most prevalences calculated at district level do show large confidence intervals due to uncertainty that arose from the sampling frame and should be interpreted with care.
