Pugh later stated he panicked and stuttered upon hearing this question and, after sitting in silence for several minutes, attempted to leave the vehicle once Bonin had slowed the van at a stoplight. In response, Bonin wordlessly leaned across and grabbed Pugh by the collar, dragging him back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>seat.</b> According to Pugh, Bonin then confided in him that he enjoyed abducting young male hitchhikers on Friday and Saturday nights, whom he then restrained and abused before strangling them to death with their own T-shirts. In a matter-of-fact tone, Bonin then informed Pugh: [...] "If you want to kill somebody, you should make a plan and find a place to dump the body before you even pick a victim." [...] Bonin then informed Pugh he had not chosen to refrain from assaulting and killing him out of sentiment; he'd been spared because the pair had been seen leaving Fraser's party together.|$|E

60|$|And {{so it was}} I went up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air at Eastbourne {{with the}} {{impression}} that flying was still an uncomfortable experimental, and slightly heroic thing to do, and came down to the cheerful gathering crowd upon the sands again with the knowledge that it is a thing achieved for everyone. It will get much cheaper, no doubt, and much swifter, and be improved in a dozen ways--we must get self-starting engines, for example, for both our aeroplanes and motor-cars--but it is available to-day for anyone who can reach it. An invalid lady of seventy could have enjoyed all that I did if only one could have got her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>seat.</b> Getting there was a little difficult, it is true; the waterplane was out in the surf, and I was carried to it on a boatman's back, and then had to clamber carefully through the wires, but that is a matter of detail. This flying is indeed so certain to become a general experience that I am sure that this description will in a few years seem almost as quaint as if I had set myself to record the fears and sensations of my First Ride in a Wheeled Vehicle. And I suspect that learning to control a Farman waterplane now is probably not much more difficult than, let us say, twice the difficulty in learning the control and management of a motor-bicycle. I cannot understand the sort of young man who won't learn how to do it if he gets half a chance.|$|R

He turns out to be Carey's ex-lover, who in turn came to the show to meet with one of Carey's fellow dancers. As he caresses the female in the dressing room, Carey sees them, and walks by them, bumping into him purposely. Additional scenes are shown of Carey laying alone on the dark runway, apparently after the show has finished, as well as preparing herself for the show. During the second verse, the video then shows Carey driving down a highway in the desert, and as she drives, past memories of the pair are shown, holding each other intimately in a bed. She then pushes old gifts he had given her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> <b>seat,</b> and pulls over the car, continuing the scene {{from the beginning of the}} video.

40|$|The Court of Appeals of Maryland held that, {{under the}} totality of the circumstances, a law {{enforcement}} officer did not have reasonable suspicion to conduct a Terry frisk of a passenger during a traffic stop. Sellman v. State, 449 Md. 526, 544, 144 A. 3 d 771, 782 (2016). The court ruled that a police department policy authorizing officers to conduct Terry frisks based on consent to search a vehicle violates the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 557, 144 A. 3 d at 790. The court further held that the crime of theft from vehicles does not imply the possession of a deadly weapon. Id. at 562, 144 A. 3 d at 793. On November 12, 2013, at approximately 2 a. m., Corporal William Daughters (2 ̆ 2 Daughters 2 ̆ 2) and Officer Dan Kramer (2 ̆ 2 Kramer 2 ̆ 2) were on patrol at an apartment complex. The location was considered a high crime area due to prior thefts from vehicles, drug arrests, and illegal possession of handguns. Daughters observed an individual, later identified as Donzel Sellman (2 ̆ 2 Sellman 2 ̆ 2), emerge from a dark area of an apartment building where there was no entrance.

50|$|While {{there are}} some exceptions, most {{commercial}} aircraft seats are forward-facing and on military aircraft seats are frequently rearward-facing. Southwest Airlines previously offered a few rearward-facings seats on some aircraft but that scheme has now ended. Rearward-facing seats are also common on business jets, to provide a conference-type layout. British Airways, United Airlines and American Airlines also have rearward-facing seats in their Club World, (select) United BusinessFirst (Intercontinental Business Class) and (select) Business Class Cabins, respectively. It {{has been argued that}} rearward-facing seats are safer because {{in the event of a}} crash, the sudden deceleration will propel <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>into</b> a rearward-facing <b>seat</b> instead of out of it, meaning the force is distributed over the entire seat back, instead of the straps of the seat belt. The argument against such seats has been based on passenger comfort, safety and cost. It could be argued that <b>passengers</b> who desire <b>the</b> natural layout of forward-facing seats may be uncomfortable with a rearward layout. On the safety aspect, the argument has been that during a plane crash, debris, such as luggage, will fly forward in the cabin, quite possibly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> in rearward-facing <b>seats.</b> On the cost aspect, rearward-facing seats need additional strengthening which adds extra weight and therefore higher fuel costs.|$|R
50|$|That night, {{they stopped}} at a motel, where D. L. caught his son playing with an out-of-order pay phone. D.

Micah told his father that his mom had an {{alternate}} personality that she didn't seem to be aware of. Micah insisted that they must help her, and D. L. reconsidered his position. Micah then admitted that he had called her and told her where they were staying. D. L. hurried Micah <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> of the car, and as he was getting into the driver's seat, he was shot by Jessica, Niki's alternate personality. Though the first shot hit him in the shoulder, he was able to phase in order to allow another bullet pass through the side of his head. He ran with his son into the nearby woods, laying a false trail to lead Jessica away from them. They found an unoccupied cabin, and D. L. unlocked the door from the inside to find some bandages. Jessica finally tracked them down and she fought with D. L., but after Micah was thrown against some rocks, Niki was able to reassert herself over Jessica, and D. L. connected with her again. However, the family reunion was short lived. After Niki realized Jessica was too dangerous, she turned herself in to police as D. L. and Micah watched helplessly.|$|E
5000|$|After {{they visit}} a night club, Parnell appears and tricks the punks into opening the trunk, killing {{one of them}} and scaring the other two away, {{allowing}} him to take the car back. Later, he picks up Otto and drives aimlessly, talking about how a brilliant scientist friend gave himself a lobotomy to deal with his work, then reveals his friend drives a Chevy Malibu before collapsing and dying from radiation exposure. Otto takes the car back to Helping Hand and leaves it in the lot. The car is stolen from the lot, and a chase ensues with all the characters involved. By this time, the car is glowing bright green. Eventually, the car reappears at the Helping Hand lot with Bud behind the wheel, however he ends up being shot and leaves the car. The various groups trying to acquire the car soon show up; government agents, the UFO scientists, and even the televangelist to whom Otto's parents gave his college funds. However, anyone who now approaches it bursts into flames, even those in flame-retardant suits. Only Miller, an eccentric mechanic who works at Helping Hand, is able to approach and enter the car. He slides behind the wheel, apparently impervious to the radiation. He beckons Otto into the Malibu, and Otto accepts eagerly, dismissing Leila's confession of love (at which point she calls him a [...] "shithead" [...] and says [...] "I'm glad I tortured you."). After he settles <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>seat,</b> the Malibu lifts straight up into the air.

50|$|The {{music video}} has three {{concurrent}} themes. The primary setting begins as Shingai Shoniwa exits a factory/warehouse type building (Alexandra Palace, North London) via blue doors. She sips {{a drink from}} a bottle, puts the bottle down and pulls on a gold bass-guitar over her shoulder. The camera pans down to her silver Dr. Martens boots, which feature in the song lyrics. After singing the first few lines of the song, her attention shifts to a blue convertible car, a Chesil Speedster (a replica of a classic Porsche 356), which she then walks over to, climbing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>seat.</b> After sitting there, as if almost pondering on past memories, she takes off her silver boots, and places them {{on the back seat}} of the car. After walking barefoot back into the building, almost closing the door, she peeks through the gap to see an anonymous male get into the vehicle and drive off with the boots still in the back. While this scene plays out, which primarily relates to the lyrics of the song, the camera frequently cuts to The Noisettes, complete with orchestral accompaniments and backing singers, practicing in what appears to be a derelict theatre (old smoke damaged theatre at Alexandra Palace), lit with a soft red light. Shoniwa is dressed in a kitsch, white tasseled dress, dancing barefoot (from removing the boots previously). Towards the end of the video, the camera begins to frequently cut to the circle balcony above the rehearsal space, where Shoniwa can be seen again, this time dressed in black, singing out over the balcony. As the music ends, the final shot shows a silhouette of Shoniwa in front of a giant red orb, as the camera pans out slightly and fades to black.|$|E
50|$|Standard {{is known}} in Alberta for the tragic {{abduction}} and murder {{of one of its}} residents, 15-year-old Kelly Cook, in 1981. The Grade 10 student regularly babysat for townsfolk, and on the morning of April 22, 1981, she {{received a phone call from}} a man who identified himself as Bill Christensen. He asked her to babysit for him that evening. Although she did not know the caller, she agreed, as 'Christensen' was a common surname in the area and crime was virtually unknown in the village, with residents routinely leaving their doors unlocked. The caller arranged to pick Kelly up that evening and drive her to his residence. At 8:30 that evening, a car pulled up in front of the house where she lived with her parents and siblings. The driver did not leave his car, and Kelly walked out of her house and climbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> automobile's front <b>passenger</b> <b>seat.</b> <b>The</b> car then immediately drove off. A few hours later, her anxious parents, concerned that Kelly had not called or returned home, called the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A massive local search was launched but yielded almost no clues. Two months after her abduction, on June 28, her badly decomposed body was discovered in Chin Lakes, southeast of her hometown of Standard. The case caught the public's attention like few other murder cases because it was so unusual, with the killer actually picking up his victim at her house while her mother watched through the window. Despite the publicity generated by this murder case, and a $100,000 reward offered by the Village of Standard for information leading to the arrest of Kelly's killer, the case currently remains unsolved.|$|R
