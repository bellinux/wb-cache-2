5|$|By late October, the German {{forces were}} worn out, {{with only a}} third of their motor {{vehicles}} still functioning, infantry divisions at third- to half-strength, and serious logistics issues preventing the delivery of warm clothing and other winter equipment to the front. Even Hitler seemed to surrender {{to the idea of a}} long struggle, since the prospect of sending tanks <b>into</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> large city without heavy infantry support seemed risky after the costly capture of Warsaw in 1939.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} {{recommended}} {{to me as}} a man of energy and enthusiasm, but he seemed shy when we met. It was only on further acquaintance that I noticed other traits. He was extremely good company, with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. I rather liked that! I discovered he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and also very excitable. He sometimes worked himself up <b>into</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> state that he lost all powers of reasoning.|$|E

5|$|By 1790, on the {{political}} front, the Commonwealth had deteriorated <b>into</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> helpless condition that it was forced into an unnatural and ultimately deadly alliance with its enemy, Prussia. The Polish-Prussian Pact of 1790 was signed, giving false hope that the Commonwealth might have at last found an ally that would shield it while it reformed itself. The May Constitution of 1791 enfranchised the bourgeoisie, established {{the separation of the}} three branches of government, and eliminated the abuses of Repnin Sejm. Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of its neighbours, wary of the potential renaissance of the Commonwealth. Again Poland dared to reform and improve itself without Russia's permission, and again the Empress Catherine II was angered; arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical Jacobinism then at high tide in France. Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth in 1792.|$|E
5|$|The {{record of}} events during the mid {{part of the}} twelfth century {{suggests}} that Leinster-based overkings of Dublin enjoyed {{the cooperation of the}} indigenous leaders of Dublin, and the emergence of the Meic Torcaill during this period may well fit <b>into</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> context. When an indigenous ruler was not to be found, however, the Dubliners seem to have sought leadership from the Isles, rather than endure a non-Leinster overking, as evidenced by the aforesaid episode concerning Gofraid. Mac Murchada's considerable authority in Dublin at this point is apparent through several ecclesiastical grants, foundations, and appointments. Furthermore, two major military operations undertaken by Dublin's forces in 1164 and 1165 were almost certainly conducted under Mac Murchada's authority. The former campaign, recorded by the thirteenth/fourteenth-century texts Brut y Tywysogyon and Brenhinedd y Saesson, concerned naval manoeuvres off Wales, in the service of Henry II, King of England (died 1189). The latter campaign, recorded by the Annals of Ulster, consisted of involvement in the ill-fated invasion of mainland Scotland, launched by Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, King of the Isles (died 1164).|$|E
5|$|There have {{previously}} been attempts at pre-season friendlies between the reigning league and cup champions. For instance, the 2002 pre-season match between Rosenborg and Viking was played between the reigning league and cup champions, {{although it had}} no official status. Superfinalen was the first attempt to make an official tournament. Such a super cup is common between the domestic league and cup winners in many European countries, such as the English Charity Shield. Superfinalen also introduced philanthropy <b>into</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> match: the game was to be baked into a larger television event which would include concerts and entertainment {{in an attempt to}} generate revenue for charity. The matchday profits from the inaugural season were, along with the television fundraising, given to UNICEF, who used the revenue to fund part of a school project in Africa, which had been fronted by Ole Gunnar Solskjær.|$|E

When the state refused, the Tribe filed suit, as allowed by the statute, against both the state of Florida and the governor, Lawton Chiles. The District Court declined to dismiss the case, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that the Eleventh Amendment barred the suit, and that the doctrine of Ex parte Young {{could not be used}} to force good faith negotiation.|$|E
25|$|By {{the mid-1990s}} the Rover Group {{was looking to}} rationalise its engine ranges and produce new designs that {{would be able to}} meet {{emissions}} legislation for the foreseeable future. The recently released K-Series petrol engine range would be extended to cover that sector, but Rover had no in-house diesel engines suitable for both its cars and its 4×4s. The 300Tdi could not be fitted to any of the car range and was about to fall foul of the upcoming Euro III emissions standards. The existing L-Series 2-litre diesel was not suitable for use in Land Rover products and could not be developed <b>into</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> unit.|$|E
25|$|In January 1907, the Painters {{petitioned the}} SBTA {{to form a}} council in New York City. The union was {{supported}} by the Tile Layers and Plumbers unions. Building and construction painting in New York City was controlled at the time by an independent union. The Painters wished to strike contractors who employed workers belonging to the independent union. A local SBTA alliance in New York would mean that the other unions would be forced to honor the Painters' jurisdictional strike—bringing the superior numbers of the other SBTA unions to bear on the contractors. Unwilling to be dragged <b>into</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> conflict, the SBTA Board of Governors voted against forming a council in New York City. The Painters disaffiliated, significantly reducing the Alliance's membership and income.|$|E

25|$|Charles Ranlett Flint who had {{engineered}} the amalgamation (via stock acquisition) forming the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) {{found it difficult}} to manage the five companies. He hired Watson as general manager on May 1, 1914 when the five companies had about 1,300 employees. Eleven months later he was made president when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved. Within four years revenues had been doubled to $9 million. In 1924, he renamed CTR to International Business Machines. Watson built IBM <b>into</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> dominant company that the federal government filed a civil antitrust suit against it in 1952. IBM owned and leased to its customers more than 90 percent of all tabulating machines in the United States at the time. When Watson died in 1956, IBM's revenues were $897 million, and the company had 72,500 employees.|$|E
25|$|Until today Lebanon did {{not sign}} ILO {{convention}} No. 87, the Freedom of Association and Protection {{of the right}} to Organize, which states in Article 2 that no prior registration with government officials is needed to form a labour union. Article 86 of the Lebanese Labour Code however specifically states the need for authorization prior to trade union formation. Since there is no deadline for Ministry of Labour to either approve or disapprove the formation of a trade union the authorization process has been criticized to be depended on the political affiliation of the ministers of labour in charge. Article 4 of the Labour Law, and Decree No. 7993 of 1952 list domestic workers as one group of workers who are barred from forming trade unions. Even though article 7 and article 92 allows foreigners to join a union, they are denied to vote for trade union representatives and being elected <b>into</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> position.|$|E
