5000|$|In 1988, the Woodland Grant Scheme {{replaced}} the Forestry Grant Scheme, paying {{nearly twice as}} much for broadleaf woodland as conifers. (In England, the Woodland Grant Scheme was subsequently replaced by the English Woodland Grant Scheme, which operates six separate kinds of grant for forestry projects.) That year, the Farm Woodlands Scheme was also introduced, and replaced by the <b>Farm</b> <b>Woodland</b> Premium Scheme in 1992. In the 1990s, a programme of afforestation resulted {{in the establishment of}} Community Forests and the National Forest, which celebrated the planting of its seven millionth tree in 2006.

50|$|In 1801, {{the civil}} parishes {{that form the}} modern borough had a total {{population}} of 1,937; and the area was characterised by <b>farming,</b> <b>woodland</b> and the fishing fleet at Barking. This last industry employed 1,370 men and boys by 1850, {{but by the end}} of the century had ceased to exist; replaced by train deliveries of fresh fish from the East Coast ports. The population rose slowly through the 19th century, as the district became built up; and new industries developed around Barking.|$|R

The parish covers an area of 975 acres and has a spot height of 170 m above sea level. From 1905, the landscape was well wooded and contained 149 acres of woods and plantations as compared with only 3.5 acres of fertile land and a further 9 acres of permanent grass.

5000|$|Hudson's Bay Company retiree, Adolphous Le Lewes (alternate {{spelling}} Lewis), {{established a}} homestead {{at the mouth}} of what is today known as the Lewis River, in 1849 (The Lewis River is the namesake of A. Le Lewes, not Merriweather Lewis as some believe). Two Iowa families, related by marriage, came next: the Solomon Strongs filed a claim in September 1850 and the Squire Bozarths filed a claim in December of the same year. Bozarth built the first frame house, in what is today Woodland, and named it [...] "Woodland Farm House." [...] Other early settlers include: Columbia Lancaster, Milly Bozarth (Wife of Squire), McKenzie and Jane Caples, Brandt and Hans Kraft. After a few years, Christopher Columbus Bozarth (Better known as C.C. and the namesake for C.C. street in Woodland), a son of Squire Bozarth, opened a store and named it [...] "Woodland," [...] after his father's <b>farm.</b> <b>Woodland</b> eventually grew on the spot where the store was located.|$|E
5000|$|The Beam <b>Farm</b> <b>Woodland</b> Archaeological District is a {{group of}} archaeological sites in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Ohio. Located at 3983 Stone Road near the village of Sabina in Clinton County, the {{district}} is composed of one Native American mound and two other archaeological sites spread out over an area of 2 acre. [...] Known as the Beam Farm Mound and the Beam Sites 9 and 12 (designated 33-CN-194, 33-CN-195, and 33-CN-208 respectively), the sites that compose the district have yielded artifacts from the Adena culture and the Hopewell tradition, both of which inhabited southwestern Ohio during the Woodland period. [...] Because both the Adena and the Hopewell lived around the mound, and because both cultures built mounds, the identity of the people who constructed the Beam Farm Mound cannot be established; all that can be known with reasonable certainty is that it was raised during the early or middle portion of the Woodland period, or between 800 BC and AD 500.|$|E
40|$|The Upper Illinois River Watershed is {{a special}} place where the threads of private, public and non‐profit {{partnerships}} are woven into the regional fabric of economic vitality; environmental stability, and social responsibility. Through its cultural heritage, the legacy of land stewardship, integrated with respect for personal property rights, continues. Natural resources are restored and sustained within a healthy mosaic of fields, forests, <b>farms,</b> <b>woodlands,</b> wetland prairies, pastures, cities, and naturally flowing streams. It is an incubator for green energy, entrepreneurial, educational and environmental initiatives...|$|R
50|$|The Communist regime, which {{seized power}} in 1948 {{in what was}} then Czechoslovakia, confiscated all the {{property}} owned by churches and persecuted many priests. Churches were then allowed to function only under the state's strict control and supervision and priests' salaries paid by the state. Churches were seized, priests jailed or executed and those allowed to lead religious services did so {{under the supervision of the}} secret police. After the Velvet Revolution, some churches and monasteries were returned, but the churches have since sought to get back other assets such as <b>farms,</b> <b>woodlands</b> and buildings.|$|R

5000|$|Today, the Circular Enclosure lies {{near the}} shore of Cowan Lake; the {{underwater}} site of the Cowan Creek Mound is only about 300 ft away, and the enclosure lies {{in the middle of}} a peninsula in the lake. The site is now located within Cowan Lake State Park, slightly less than 1 mi south of the present State Route 730. Officials have sought to allow the site and surrounding lands to return to the condition in which they existed before the region was settled. [...] As a result, the site has never been subjected to intensive professional testing; archaeologists accordingly are unaware of whether any additional sites, such as a village location, might be nearby. [...] In 1974, the Cowan Creek Circular Enclosure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its value as an archaeological site. Four other Clinton County archaeological sites are listed on the Register: the Beam <b>Farm</b> <b>Woodland</b> Archaeological District, and the Hillside Haven, Hurley, and Keiter Mounds.|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in {{lowlands}} of Friuli Venezia Giulia, North-eastern Italy. Bird species richness in 28 <b>farm</b> <b>woodland</b> was compared with the one in 26 control habitats, the latter being patches of semi-natural woods and shrubs within 1 kilometre. The analysis of landscape pattern was based on the land use of a 2 km buffer around the habitats, as landscape metrics we consider: at the patch level (<b>farm</b> <b>woodland</b> and control habitats) the patch area, patch perimeters, shape factor, at different spatial scales (500 m, 1000 m, 2000 m) the relative presence of land use classes. About landscape metrics the most important contributions to regression model are by vegetation complexity index, perimeter and presence of <b>farm</b> <b>woodland</b> in surrounding landscape. Important are also the presence of edges, woodland and arboreal cultivation but with a different weight at the different spatial scales...|$|E
40|$|Since 1987 the UK {{government}} has operated a <b>farm</b> <b>woodland</b> policy which uses incentive payments {{to encourage the}} establishment of woodlands by farmers. This paper uses a utility‐maximizing model of farmer behaviour to explore how farmers react to incentives. An assessment is then made of farmer objectives when entering the <b>Farm</b> <b>Woodland</b> Premium Scheme and a logit model is used to determine which contextual factors are good predictors of uptake. Farm size {{and the proportion of}} the farm area in existing woodland were significantly associated with an increased probability of entry into the scheme. The paper then explores the efficiency of voluntary schemes and in particular their additionality. The paper finishes by assessing the impacts on employment of farm level forestry in comparison with other types of planting...|$|E
