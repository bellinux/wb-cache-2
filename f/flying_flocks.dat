5000|$|Geese {{are large}} birds {{belong to the}} family of the Anatidae, {{subfamily}} of the Anserinae, and the tribe of the Anserini. The geese in the genus Anser have a Holarctic distribution, and include the grey geese. White geese sometimes are sometimes included in Anser, and sometimes described as being in the genus Chen, and their breeding areas are in subarctic areas of North America and around the Bering Strait. The black geese are in the genus Branta and occur in the Palearctic ecozone: they are called [...] "black" [...] due to the coloring of their legs, bills, and parts of their plumage, which are black or dark grey. The family Anatidae includes ducks and swans. Unless domestic, geese are generally migratory, traveling lengthy distances in between their summer habitats in the north and their winter habitats in the south. In China, geese have been domesticated for thousands of years: these have been primarily been bred from the wild species Anser cygnoides, and are also known as the Swan Goose or the Chinese Goose. True geese are difficult to differentiate into genus or species based on anatomical differences other than coloration, especially if the geese occur, as they often do in poetry, in the distance, flying, and perhaps even more heard than seen: but, the genus and species identification is not generally of importance in Chinese poetry, although whether the goose is wild or domestic is of importance. Geese are social animals, and tend to appear in flocks of many individuals; and, as they tend to pair up to mate, which as part of the process often includes a flying duet, with the male chasing the female through the air; and, often the flock will contain many breeding pairs. One of the distinctive features of <b>flying</b> <b>flocks</b> of geese is their typical [...] "V" [...] or wedge-shaped formation, and the loud vocalizations which accompany them on their flight. A lone goose is somewhat of an anomaly in nature. Geese and their eggs have been used for food, their feathers for thermal insulation and other purposes, and their arrivals and departures as seasonal indicators. Human interactions with geese have often included hunting wild geese with projectile weapons, raising and breeding domestic geese, or observing, and perhaps depicting them in paint or poetry.|$|E
40|$|Flocks {{of birds}} perform some aerial phenomena, which have amazed {{many of its}} viewers. This thesis is a {{literature}} review, which concerns the three major questions of ‘When’, ‘How’ and ‘Why’ birds fly in flocks. <b>Flying</b> <b>flocks</b> are roughly dividable in two types: ball shaped clusters and line formations. Whereas cluster flying is commonly used throughout the year by groups of birds, for example while transiting between their roosting and their foraging sites, formation flight is almost specifically used for migration. The departure time of migration is a critical moment in the annual cycle of the bird. The exact moment of departure is an optimization of several external and internal factors, including migrating distance, energy reserves and weather conditions. Clusters have a three-dimensional structure and tend to be rather disorganized. When a predator is nearby, clusters often start to perform rapid manoeuvres. Previously believed to be coordinated by telepathy or electromagnetic communication, due to high-speed filming scientists have determined that these manoeuvres are initiated by one individual bird and followed {{by the rest of}} the flock. The individual fulfilling the role of initiator changes from moment to moment. The most likely explanation for movement in a cluster is a self-organization mechanism where each bird applies a few behavioural rules in response to local information from neighbouring birds. There are different kinds of formations, ranging from an acute V-formation to a U-shaped bow. Although the total energy saving is the same for different formations, it differs for individual birds in the group. In an acute formation, the leader gains little or no energy savings, while in a U-formation the energy savings are more egalitarian. A reason for obtaining a specific formation may be related to kin-selection or reciprocity, although no empirical evidence for this hypothesis has been found yet. Several specific reasons have been put forward for birds to fly in clusters, mainly regarding predation prevention. These advantages include increased predator detection, a dilution effect, physical protection of neighbours and a confusion effect. Two hypotheses exist for a structured formation, like the well known V-shape. One is the aerodynamic advantage hypothesis, in which birds conserve energy by taking advantage of the upwash vortices created by the wings of the birds in front. The other is the communication and orientation hypothesis, in which birds make use of their position for their combined orientation experience and visual communication. These explanations are not mutually exclusive, and various studies have given support to both of them. However, no conclusive evidence has been found for any of the both hypotheses. There is still a debate going on between supporters and criticasters of both hypotheses which remains unsolved upon till now. A review of the literature concerning the subject of flock flying shows that the use (the ‘When’) and the organization (the ‘How’) of flock flying have been thoroughly researched, which has led to a consistent view on these subjects. However, thorough research on the main reasons for flock flying (the ‘Why’) has not given a clear view yet. Also behavioural aspects of the organization and departure are still shrouded. These subjects still raise enough questions to provide research options for years to come. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAutonomous {{formation}} <b>flying</b> (<b>flocking)</b> of UAVs requires {{coordination of}} efforts and solutions in multiple research fields (robotics, {{wireless sensor networks}} to name a few). The Airborne Embedded auTonomOUs Robust Network of Objects and Sensors (AETOURNOS) project is designed as a federative, fueling platform and global evaluation tool. It has spawned another collaborative project bridging the gap between Computer Science and Automation: 6 PO (Cyber-Physical Systems and Cooperative Control of a Fleet of UAVs). We want to investigate new flocking strategies, mobility-aware communication protocols (and reciprocally: movements influenced by network QoS), and to ease the cooperation between experts, we need co-simulation solutions, and "universal" control interfaces. This article presents our first contribution to this grand scheme: a stand-alone simulation of an autonomous flocking strategy taking into account both {{the dynamics of the}} UAVs and their communications, which has allowed us to examine the relation between network unreliability and control computation. To better study the influence of the communication network, we present an architecture coupling a dedicated network simulator with the UAVs simulator, as well as with a real drone piloting interface. The lessons learned help us build a research and action plan for the years to come...|$|R

Flight data showed that the homing performance of the birds <b>flying</b> as a <b>flock</b> was significantly better than that of the birds released individually. When <b>flying</b> in a <b>flock,</b> pigeons showed no resting episodes, shorter homing times, higher speed, and almost no circling around the start zone in comparison to individual flights. Moreover, flock-flying pigeons took a nearly direct, “beeline” route to the loft, whereas individually flying birds preferred to follow roads and other longitudinal landmarks leading towards the loft, even when it caused a detour. Our results show that group cohesion facilitates a shift towards more efficient homing strategies: individuals prefer navigating by familiar landmarks, while flocks show a compass orientation...|$|R

5|$|Like other white-eyes, {{the golden}} white-eye is diurnal. In {{contrast}} to the bridled white-eye, which forages in groups and is not territorial, the golden white-eye occurs in pairs or small family groups consisting of a breeding pair and fledged young. The golden white-eye is also territorial, and pairs will sing throughout the day in response to neighbouring pairs. Groups can become aggressive when they encounter one another. The golden white-eye is also aggressive towards the smaller bridled white-eye, chasing it away from food and perches and <b>flying</b> through <b>flocks</b> of {{them in order to}} disperse them. While it chases other forest passerines, it is less aggressive towards them, and in fact the rufous fantail seeks out the golden white-eye, foraging behind it to snatch insects flushed by the latter species. The golden white-eye is socially dominant over the bridled white-eyes and rufous fantails, but it is subordinate to the Micronesian myzomela and is chased by that species. It is also occasionally chased by the fantails if it approaches their nests too closely.|$|R
