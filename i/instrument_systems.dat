2500|$|The {{development}} of affordable and miniaturized computers has helped in the simplification {{of the use}} of this instrument, as well as allowed great improvements in the amount of time it takes to analyze a sample. [...] In 1964, Electronic Associates, Inc. (EAI), a leading U.S. supplier of analog computers, began development [...] of a computer controlled quadrupole mass spectrometer under the direction of Robert E. Finnigan. [...] By 1966 Finnigan and collaborator Mike Uthe's EAI division had sold over 500 quadrupole residual gas-analyzer instruments. [...] In 1967, Finnigan left EAI to form the Finnigan Instrument Corporation along with Roger Sant, T. Z. Chou, Michael Story, and William Fies. In early 1968, they delivered the first prototype quadrupole GC/MS instruments to Stanford and Purdue University. When Finnigan Instrument Corporation was acquired by Thermo <b>Instrument</b> <b>Systems</b> (later Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 1990, it was considered [...] "the world's leading manufacturer of mass spectrometers".|$|E

New digital systems enable more complex control tasks and especially their application to safety <b>instrumented</b> <b>systems</b> (SIS) has created a need for new verification methods such as model checking. Our goal is to study the applicability of model checking methods to a real safety <b>instrumented</b> <b>system</b> used in industry and to evaluate whether such a system can be modelled on a level which, on one hand, enables verification of relevant safety properties and, on the other hand, keeps {{the size of the}} model feasible. A central objective is also to create a general methodology for applying model checking to analysing safety <b>instrumented</b> <b>systems.</b> As a case study we modelled an application of UTU Falcon arc protection system along with its environment with NuSMV modelling language. Moreover, we used NuSMV to verify this model against the most relevant safety properties for the system. Our results indicate that model checking seems to be a promising method for verification of safety <b>instrumented</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
