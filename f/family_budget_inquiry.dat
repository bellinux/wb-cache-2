5000|$|Polish sociologists began {{analyzing}} poverty {{almost as}} soon as sociology was established there. Early research institutions, such as the Institute of Social Economy in the Warsaw School of Economics, analyzed poverty, unemployment and the interwar economic migrations. Aside from census data and <b>family</b> <b>budget</b> <b>inquiries,</b> poverty was documented by independent investigations and autobiographical materials. The advent of communism interrupted this research tradition; poverty became a political issue, a social, political and ideological taboo. It was dismissed as a remnant of the previous regime or a byproduct of transitional difficulties; poverty and the poor were labeled with euphemisms such as [...] "sphere of deficiency" [...] or [...] "low-income groups". Book or report titles prior to 1989 never used the term [...] "poverty", while the neglect it received can also be seen in the lack of policies or related legislation. Scientific investigations were limited, with the most important research taking place in periods of relative openness: the time after the Polish October, the early 1970s, and 1980-1981. A number of important studies were published in spite of the prevailing ideology, but their publication was either seriously restricted or banned.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{present study}} {{assessed}} the {{pregnancy and lactation}} performances of rats fed an experimental diet based on the foods listed in the <b>Family</b> <b>Budget</b> Survey (Pesquisa de Orçamento Familiar) 2002 / 2003 {{and the impact of}} said diet on the growth and development of the pups until weaning. METHODS: Wistar (n= 12) rats were randomly divided into two groups: a control group (control group, n= 6) fed a commercial chow (Labina®, Brazil) and an experimental group (n= 6) fed the <b>Family</b> <b>Budget</b> Survey diet during the entire pregnancy and lactation period. All animals had free access to food and water during the entire study period. RESULTS: The <b>Family</b> <b>Budget</b> Survey diet increased the duration of pregnancy (control group= 21. 00 ± 0. 00; POFG= 21. 57 ± 0. 55, p= 0. 025) and made the dams lose weight during the lactation period (control group= 27. 92 ± 18. 47 g; POFG=- 15. 66 ± 16. 90 g). The <b>Family</b> <b>Budget</b> Survey group presented low food, energy and nutrient intakes during pregnancy, which became even lower during lactation. Pups from <b>Family</b> <b>Budget</b> Survey dams presented lower body weight at weaning (control group= 52. 38 ± 4. 49 g; POFG= 39. 88 ± 2. 78 g, p= 0. 001) and lower nose-to-anus length (control group= 117. 37 ± 0. 64 mm; POFG= 125. 62 ± 0. 96 mm, p= 0. 001). However, some physical milestones and reflexes occurred earlier, such as the placing response reflex [control group= 12. 00 (9. 00 - 15. 00) days; POFG= 9. 50 (9. 00 - 14. 00) days] aerial righting reflex [control group= 18. 00 (17. 00 - 20. 00) days; POFG= 16. 00 (13. 00 - 18. 00) days] and unfolding of the external ear [control group= 3. 00 (3. 00 - 3. 00) days; POFG= 2. 00 (2. 00 - 3. 00) days]. CONCLUSION: The <b>Family</b> <b>Budget</b> Survey diet seems to be more detrimental to the physical growth of the pups than to their brain growth, according to the assessed reflexes and physical milestones and measures. This {{may be due to the}} low protein content of the diet for rat reproduction and growth combined with adequate fat and essential fatty acid contents.

40|$|This {{essay is}} writtened {{to clarify the}} {{difference}} of saving pattern between wage-earners and non-wage earners. In our country, the <b>family</b> <b>budget</b> data in 28 cities has been shown monthly. But as for non-wage earners, the income data has not been researched. If the summation of expenditure to consume, saving and tax is equal to income, we can easily compare the saving pattern of wage and non wage earners. But the <b>family</b> <b>budget</b> data do not deal with net saving, - disposable income minus consumption -, but the gross saving that is paid in that month. So that if we estimate the non-wage earner's income in above descriptive method, we shall meet some statistical error. We tested the degree of this error by wage-earner's <b>family</b> <b>budget</b> data, and compare the saving pattern of wage and non-wage earners. So far as <b>family</b> <b>budget</b> data is concerned, the propensity to save of wage earners is larger than non-wage earners at 1956. On the other hand, according to predictional research to consume, the wage-earner's propensity to save is smaller than non-wage earners. What {{is the cause of}} this difference? First the fitness of the regression line is not always good. Although the co-efficient of correlation is relatively high, but in some cases we ought to regard the correlation as curve, not a line. Saving is affected not only by income level, but also income change, liquid assets, labor force etc., Second, according to predictional research, the "saving" is dealt with as net saving. In national accounting, we deal with the aggregate saving. But owing to the deficit of higher income group's <b>family</b> <b>budget</b> data, we cannot estimate the aggregate saving pattern. In place of that analysis, we consider the relation between the distribution of banking deposit and income, and conclude; (1) we may guess that the propensity to save higher income groups will be increasing progressively. (2) the relation between saving and liquid assets is not simultaneous. The larger the amount of liquid assets are, the larger the saving-ratio is...|$|R

40|$|Ricardian trade {{theory was}} based on the cost of labor at a time when grain and other {{consumer}} goods accounted for most subsistence spending. But today's budgets are dominated by payments to the finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE) sector and to newly privatized monopolies. This has made FIRE the determining factor in trade competitiveness. The major elements in US <b>family</b> <b>budgets</b> are housing (with prices bid up on credit), debt service, and health insurance - and wage withholding for financializing Social Security and Medicare. Industrial firms also have been financialized, using debt leverage to increase their return on equity. The effect is for interest to increase as a proportion of cash flow (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA). Corporate raiders pay their high-interest bondholders, while financial managers also are using EBITDA for stock buybacks to increase share prices (and hence the value of their stock options). Shifting taxes off property and onto employment and retail sales spurs the financialization of <b>family</b> and business <b>budgets</b> as tax cuts on property are capitalized into higher bank loans. Payments to government agencies for taxes and presaving for Social Security and Medicare absorb another 30 percent of <b>family</b> <b>budgets.</b> These transfer payments to the FIRE sector and government agencies have transformed international cost structures, absorbing roughly 75 percent of US <b>family</b> <b>budgets.</b> This helps explain the deteriorating US industrial trade balance as the economy has become financialized...|$|R
