The move took longer than expected due to adverse weather conditions, which included lightning warnings. The crawler also had to pause occasionally so mud could be removed from its treads and bearings. Technicians then quickly prepared the shuttle to host the crew’s countdown dress rehearsal known as the Terminal Countdown Demonstration Test (TCDT). Discovery’s seven astronauts flew to Kennedy on 5 August 2009 for the training activity which concludes later in the week with a complete practice countdown, minus liftoff, involving the crew and the launch team. Meanwhile, in an unprecedented operation, modifications were made to the left Solid rocket booster on the pad. The modifications involved replacement of a check valve <b>filter</b> <b>assembly</b> in the booster which was found to have broken.

This has also been decided as a suspect factor in the foam shedding during STS-127. The air in the voids could have expanded due to the high temperatures generated during ascent thus breaking the foam. The reviews considered a rollback as an option since the defect could not be set right in the pad. Later, the tank was cleared for launch as is without any additional inspections.|$|E

Fifty-two (52) brands of cigarettes sold in Canada and 2 brands of Philip Morris's Merit cigarettes sold in the U. S. were tested. On the 15 -layer <b>filter</b> paper <b>assembly,</b> 51 brands of the cigarettes sold in Canada produced 90 to 100 % full-length burning. These cigarettes plus those 10 brands of the cigarettes tested previously (which produced 95 to 100 % full-length burning) have a relatively high propensity to ignite upholstered furniture if lit and dropped on soft furnishings. These high percentages of full-length burns demonstrate the need to make cigarettes less prone to cause fires. Only 3 brands of the cigarettes tested were found to have a low ignition propensity.

50|$|In {{most modern}} installations, an {{electronic}} device called a tachometric relay or safety switch {{is used to}} operate electrical shut-off solenoids.

These valves are usually both connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch. Where solenoids are fitted to the outputs of fuel tanks, these are also connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch. In installations with multiple tanks, a switch or changeover relay may be fitted to allow the driver to select which tank to use fuel from.

Changes included the addition of an oil level sensor and relocating the oil <b>filter</b> <b>assembly</b> for better access. The engine was also modified for the Quest and Villager to become a non-interference design: if the timing belt were to break, the pistons wouldn't come in contact with any open valves in the cylinders. The Quest was available as XE or GXE models. Because of manufacturing issues, Nissan had an arrangement for Ford to assemble the minivan in North America, and in turn they were allowed to rebadge it and sell it under the Mercury brand as the Villager. Many of the interior parts, including the radio, heater controls and power windows controls were adapted from Ford, and were similar to the Ford Aerostar. This generation of the Quest and Villager was built at Ford's Ohio Assembly plant in Avon Lake, Ohio. The van shared the modified version of the VG30E from the U11, and early J30 Maximas, as well as the 4-speed automatic transmission from the Maxima.The Quest/Villager engine seems to have a serious flaw in the crankshaft, as they break at the front stub.

50|$|In cold weather, {{high speed}} diesel engines can be {{difficult}} to start because the mass of the cylinder block and cylinder head absorb the heat of compression, preventing ignition due to the higher surface-to-volume ratio. Pre-chambered engines make use of small electric heaters inside the pre-chambers called glowplugs, while direct-injected engines have these glowplugs in the combustion chamber. Many engines use resistive heaters in the intake manifold to warm the inlet air for starting, or until the engine reaches operating temperature. Engine block heaters (electric resistive heaters in the engine block) connected to the utility grid are used in cold climates when an engine is turned off for extended periods (more than an hour), to reduce startup time and engine wear. Block heaters are also used for emergency power standby Diesel-powered generators which must rapidly pick up load on a power failure. In the past, a wider variety of cold-start methods were used. Some engines, such as Detroit Diesel engines used a system to introduce small amounts of ether into the inlet manifold to start combustion. Others used a mixed system, with a resistive heater burning methanol. An impromptu method, particularly on out-of-tune engines, is to manually spray an aerosol can of ether-based engine starter fluid into the intake air stream (usually through the intake air <b>filter</b> <b>assembly).</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} {{for personal}} sampling for inhalable aerosol hazards is constrained by issues of sampler cost and complexity; these issues have limited the adoption {{and use of}} some samplers by practicing hygienists. Thus, despite the known health effects of inhalable aerosol hazards, personal exposures are routinely assessed for {{only a small fraction}} of the at-risk workforce. To address the limitations of current technologies for inhalable aerosol sampling, a disposable inhalable aerosol sampler was developed and evaluated in the laboratory. The new sampler is designed to be less expensive and simpler to use than existing technologies.

The results were compared to the proposed low-velocity inhalability criterion as well as published data on the IOM sampler.
