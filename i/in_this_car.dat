25|$|According to police, {{shortly after}} Forbes and Beach left at 8:05 PM, an African American {{man with a}} carbine emerged from the Evans house and stood guard. A few minutes later, Evans and about 16 others, all of them heavily armed and wearing crossed bandoliers of ammunition, emerged from the house. The guard crossed the street and aimed his gun at the unmarked police vehicle sitting at Auburndale and E. 124th Street. The surveillants radioed for instructions, and at 8:20 PM were told to flee the area. The police vehicle turned right onto E. 124th Street, {{followed}} by a station wagon. The police claimed they heard a shot. The other police vehicle also fled the scene, turning right (south) onto Lakeview Avenue. The police <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>car</b> also said they heard several shots.|$|E
25|$|The 29 car {{returned}} in 2005 at Bristol Motor Speedway {{as part of}} a promotion for Reese's Chocolate and Peanut Butter Lovers Cups. The promotion involved the 29 painted as the Chocolate Lovers car and the 21 painted as the Peanut Butter Lovers car. The plan was for Jeff Burton to drive the 29 while Kevin Harvick would drive the 21. Qualifying was rained out, so the entries were switched to assure that both cars would make the field (Harvick was a past champion and the No. 29 was not locked in). Burton drove the 21 while Harvick drove the 29. Harvick won the race <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>car</b> with Burton finishing second in the 21. Later in the season, Mayflower Transit came on to sponsor Burton after a seven-year relationship with him.|$|E
25|$|What {{is now the}} No. 33 car {{started as}} the No. 90 car in 2003. RCR entered the No. 90 Chevrolet in the fall Talladega race with John Andretti driving. The car was {{sponsored}} by AOL 9.0 and was numbered 90 for marketing purposes. Ron Hornaday, Jr. ran the No. 90 in the season-ending Ford 400 with Childress Vineyards on the hood. In 2004, {{it was announced that}} Kerry Earnhardt would drive the car (renumbered to 33) in five NASCAR Nextel Cup races. Mike Skinner would run the car in the Daytona 500, finishing 22nd. Earnhardt drove the car in the other three restrictor plate races with Bass Pro Shops sponsoring, getting his best finish of 24th. He attempted all of the restrictor plate races again in 2005, finishing 17th at Talladega. In addition, road course ringer Brian Simo brought home a 10th-place finish at Infineon Raceway. Clint Bowyer (Childress' Busch Series driver) made his Nextel Cup debut <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>car</b> with a Sylvania sponsorship at Phoenix in April 2005. Scott Wimmer ran the season finale in 2005, attempted two races in 2006 (making one start), and only made one start out of seven attempts in 2007. On May 2, 2008, Wimmer attempted but failed to qualify for the 2008 Crown Royal presents the Dan Lowry 400 at Richmond. Wimmer had sponsorships from Holiday Inn and Camping World/RVs.com. Ken Schrader and Mike Wallace ran one race apice in 2008.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1967, {{after just}} 28 {{appearances}} for Blackpool, Hughes joined Liverpool for £65,000, (based on increases in average earnings, {{this would be}} approximately £1,940,000 in 2013). Manager Bill Shankly was stopped in his car by the police as he drove Hughes to Liverpool {{for the first time}} and said: [...] "Don't you know who I've got <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>car?</b> The captain of England!" [...] The policeman peered through the window and said that he didn't recognise the man, to which Shankly replied: [...] "No, but you will!"

2500|$|And {{for larger}} {{displacement}} engines, the supercharger has been fitted to an all-new aluminium alloy 90° V6 engine, which displaces [...] [...] Now used in all current Audi four-door saloons and five-door Avants (Audi's name for an estate car) - from the Audi S4 upwards, {{along with the}} two-door Audi A5 coupé - it uses an all-new Eaton 'Twin Vortices Series' (TVS) Roots-type positive displacement compressor. [...] This new blower features twin four-lobe rotors which are twisted 160-degrees. [...] It is mounted {{on top of the}} engine within the 'Vee', pumping air directly into the inlet manifold. [...] This new design of supercharger is said to reduce the noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) of the engine. [...] In 'standard' tune, this engine produces [...] at 4,850-6,500rpm, and [...] at 2,500-4,800rpm. [...] However, a higher performance variant is fitted to the latest B8 Audi S4, and <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>car,</b> produces [...] at 5,500-7,000rpm, and [...] at 2,500-5,000rpm - which makes this new S4 more potent than its immediate predecessor, with its 4.2-litre V8. [...] This engine is also scheduled to be fitted to a new hybrid version of the Volkswagen Touareg.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>car.</b> Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a sense that you are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E

60|$|The train {{moved on}} and on, leaving {{what had been}} Benton far behind; and once more Allie opened her weary eyes to the dim, obscure reaches of the desert. Her heart beat very slowly under its leaden weight, its endless pang. Her blood flowed at low ebb. She felt the long-forgotten {{recurrence}} of an old morbid horror, like a poison lichen fastening upon the very spring of life. It passed and came again, and left her once more. Her thoughts wandered back along the night track she had traversed, until again her ears were haunted by that strange sound which had given Roaring City its name. She had been torn away from hope, love, almost life itself. Where was Neale? He had turned from her, obedient to Allison Lee and the fatal complexity and perversenes's of life. The vindication of her spiritual faith {{and the answer to}} her prayers lay in {{the fact that she had}} been saved; but rather than to be here <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>car,</b> daughter of a rich father, but separated from Neale, she would have preferred to fill one of the nameless graves in Benton.|$|E

6000|$|Some {{understanding}} {{of all this}} was beating home to Bertha's head and heart. She had as yet no keen desire for the glitter of wealth, but its grateful shelter, its power to defend and nurture, were qualities which had begun to make its lure almost irresistible. Haney liked the auto-car, not for its red and gold (which delighted Lucius), but for its handiness in taking him about the city. It saved him from climbing {{in and out of}} a high car door; it was swifter and safer than a carriage; therefore, he was ready to purchase its speed and convenience. He cared little for the sensation he would create in riding up to his sister's door in Brooklyn, though he chuckled mightily at the thought of what his old dad would say; and as they claimed a place among the millionaires he broke into a sly smile. [...] "If ever a bog-trotter landed at Castle Garden, me father was wan o' them. I can remember the hat he wore. 'Twas a 'stovepipe,' sure enough. It had no rim at all at all! It was fuzzy as a cat.
