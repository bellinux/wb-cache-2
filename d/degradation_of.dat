A small amount of arabinose is formed during the oxidation of cellotriose. The main alkaline degradation products for the three oligomers include 3 -deoxy-isosaccharinic acid- 1, 4 -lactone and 3 -deoxy-hexonic acid- 1, 4 -lactone.

The radical attack from H 2 O 2 is probably at the glycosidic linkage, resulting in the formation of a series <b>of</b> <b>degradation</b> products. <b>Degradations</b> <b>of</b> cellooligosaccharides in alkaline solution are elucidated to follow an enediol anion reaction mechanism...|$|R

5|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have indicated}} that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, CreutzfeldtâJakob disease, and motor neuron diseases, polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac Ischemic injury, ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS proteolysis {{plays a major role in}} responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-ÎºB, c-Myc, HIF-1Î±, MATÎ±2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS regulates the <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> tumor suppressor gene products such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-ÎºB which further regulates the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-Î±, IL-Î², IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P selectine) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through proteolysis of cyclines and the <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of eukaryotic genes are stored {{on a set}} of large, linear chromosomes. The chromosomes are packed within the nucleus in complex with storage proteins called histones to form a unit called a nucleosome. DNA packaged and condensed in this way is called chromatin. The manner in which DNA is stored on the histones, as well as chemical modifications of the histone itself, regulate whether a particular region of DNA is accessible for gene expression. In addition to genes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the DNA is copied without <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division: replication origins, telomeres and the centromere. Replication origins are the sequence regions where DNA replication is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome. Telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent <b>degradation</b> <b>of</b> coding and regulatory regions during DNA replication. The length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the aging process. The centromere is required for binding spindle fibres to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during cell division.|$|E
