40|$|In {{this thesis}} <b>I</b> <b>will</b> explore the {{possibilities}} of a new graphic technique called styrography, focusing on finding what means are necessary to creating a matrix and what different prints you can make. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> be comparing techniques of high press, their positive and negative aspects, but above all I am interested in what kind of expressive possibilities they offer in comparison with styrography. Since styrography was originally "invented" for schools, which art classes are limited in time {{when it comes to}} creating, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> explore the suitability of the technique and its variants for teaching in primary and secondary schools. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> also write recommendations for safely carrying out the technique in the classroom, when and where, or rather in which classes, it is advisable to do so and what protection is necessary during implementation. In the didactic part of this task there will be, among other things, a few ideas for using this technique in interpretation of art concepts in each class (from 6 th to 9 th grade). <b>I</b> <b>will</b> also <b>prepare</b> a concrete example of teaching lesson preparation that teachers can use to implement styrography. ...|$|R

Beware persecutors, you {{think that when you}} have slain the godly, you are then rid of them; but you are far wide, their blood which you have shed, cries in the ears of God against you. O the cries of blood are strong cries, they are cries that reach to heaven; yea they are cries that have a continual voice, and that never cease to make a noise, until they have {{procured}} vengeance form the hands of the Lord of sabbath (Job 16:18): And therefore this is the word of the Lord against all those that are for the practice of Cain: [...] "As I live, saith the Lord God, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>prepare</b> thee unto blood and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, [that is, hated to shed it,] even blood shall pursue thee" [...] (Eze 35:6).|$|E
6000|$|In {{a letter}} to the President the same day he writes: [...] "Your {{confidence}} in me, sir, has been unlimited, and I can truly affirm unabused. My sensations, then, cannot be concealed, when I find that confidence so suddenly withdrawn, without a word or distant hint being previously dropped to me. This, sir, as I mentioned in your room, is a situation in which I cannot hold my present office, and therefore I hereby resign it. It will not, however, be concluded from hence that I mean to relinquish the inquiry. No, sir; very far from it. I will also meet any inquiry; and to prepare for it, if I learn there is a chance of overtaking Mr. Fauchet before he sails, I will go to him immediately. I have to beg the favor of you to permit me to be furnished with a copy of the letter, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>prepare</b> an answer to it; which I perceive that I cannot do as I wish, merely upon the few hasty memoranda which I took with my pencil....|$|E

In {{the second}} place, I shall {{endeavour}} to prevail upon all the younger {{members of the}} University who wish to attend the art lectures, to give at least so much time to manual practice as may enable them {{to understand the nature}} and difficulty of executive skill. The time so spent will not be lost, even as regards their other studies at the University, for <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>prepare</b> the practical exercises in a double series, one illustrative of history, the other of natural science. And whether you are drawing a piece of Greek armour, or a hawk's beak, or a lion's paw, you will find that the mere necessity of using the hand compels attention to circumstances which would otherwise have escaped notice, and fastens them in the memory without farther effort. But were it even otherwise, and this practical training did really involve some sacrifice of your time, I do not fear but that it will be justified to you by its felt results: and I think that general public feeling is also tending to the admission that accomplished education must include, not only full command of expression by language, but command of true musical sound by the voice, and of true form by the hand.|$|E

In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages. I think it however a greater evil to the white man than to the black race, & while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former. The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, socially & physically.
