40|$|Abstract—Feature subset {{selection}} {{is an important}} step to-wards producing a classifier that relies only on relevant features, while keeping the computational complexity of the classifier low. Feature {{selection is}} also used in making inferences on the importance of attributes, even when classification is not the ultimate goal. For example, in bioinformatics and genomics feature subset selection is used to make inferences between the variables that best describe multiple populations. Unfortunately, many feature selection algorithms require the subset size to be specified a priori, but knowing how many variables to select is typically a nontrivial task. Other approaches rely on a specific variable subset selection framework to be used. In this work, we examine an approach to feature subset selection works with a <b>generic</b> <b>variable</b> selection algorithm, and our approach provides statistical inference on the number of features that are relevant, which may be unknown to the <b>generic</b> <b>variable</b> selection algorithm. This work extends our previous implementation of a Neyman-Pearson feature selection (NPFS) hypothesis test, which acts as a meta-subset selection algorithm. Specifically, we examine the conservativeness of the NPFS approach by biasing the hypothesis test, and examine other heuristics for NPFS. We include results from carefully designed synthetic datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the NPFS’s ability to perform on data of a massive scale.

40|$|Using {{the cluster}} {{category}} and the Caldero-Chapoton map, we introduce <b>generic</b> <b>variables</b> in an acyclic cluster algebra A(Q). We prove that cluster monomials in an acyclic cluster algebra naturally arise as <b>generic</b> <b>variables.</b> We give an explicit description of these <b>generic</b> <b>variables</b> {{in terms of}} Auslander-Reiten theory of the path algebra of Q. We prove that the <b>generic</b> <b>variables</b> form a Z-basis in a certain class of cluster algebras of affine type, including affine type A. In this study, we get interested in the behaviour {{of the values of}} the Caldero-Chapoton map for regular modules over the algebra of an acyclic quiver Q. We introduce a generalization of Chebyshev polynomials and prove that they arise naturally in this context. This allows to prove multiplication formulas for variables associated to regular modules when Q is affine. Using cluster characters, we give a simplified proof of a result of Buan, Marsh and Reiten about denominators of cluster variables. This result states that in an acyclic cluster algebra, denominators of cluster variables viewed as Laurent polynomials in any cluster can be interpreted through the cluster-tilting theory of the associated cluster category. Finally, we investigate non-simply-laced cluster algebras through simply laced cluster algebras endowed with a certain group of automorphisms. We prove that if A is an antisymmetrizable matrix with a group of admissible automorphisms G, then the cluster algebra associated to the quotient matrix A/G is a subalgebra of a certain quotient of the cluster algebra associated to A. When possible, we give an interpretation in terms of invariant objects in the associated cluster category. LYON 1 -BU. Sciences (692662101) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|R
