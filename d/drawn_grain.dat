First, settlement sizes grew with agrarian technology because more productive farmers freed more people for urban specialty occupations. Second, land and maritime transportation improvements made it possible to supply great cities of 1,000,000, plus inhabitants such as Rome, Baghdad, and the Chinese capital cities. Rome, for example, could <b>draw</b> <b>grain</b> and other bulk raw materials from Sicily, North Africa, Egypt, and Southern France to sustain large populations, even by modern standards, using maritime transport on the Mediterranean.

40|$|AbstractSuperplastic-like forming is {{a recent}} {{developed}} sheet-forming process that combines hot drawing (mechanical pre-forming) with gas forming. It is {{an efficient way to}} form sheet metals into complex parts for automotive and aerospace industries. In comparison with conventional superplastic forming process, the forming time for superplastic-like forming can be significantly shortened as the hot-drawing step would have produced a pre-formed component before gas forming. The other advantage of the superplastic-like forming is its capacity for lower temperature forming, for which superplasticity is not possible. Non-superplastic grade Ti- 6 Al- 4 V sheets were successfully formed by superplastic-like forming at 800 °C in 16 min. The maximum percentage thinning of 54 % occurred at the outward corners. In this paper, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was used to examine the microstructure evolution of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V at different forming stages during superplastic-like forming process. Some small equiaxed grains, regarded as newly recrystallized grains, were observed near the deformed area after hot <b>drawing.</b> <b>Grains</b> became more randomly distributed as the recrystallization continued during gas forming stage. The as-received structures were finally replaced by the equiaxed grains with an almost random misorientation distribution after the forming process. Dynamic recrystallization was considered as the main deformation mechanism for the non-superplastic grade Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy...|$|R

50|$|If the {{achievements}} in our battle against merchant tonnage have been encouraging thus far, then the exceptionally poor world harvest of grain, including feed grain, this year {{provides us with}} a unique opportunity, which nobody could responsibly reject. Both North America and Canada will probably cease their grain exports to England in February. Then that country will have to <b>draw</b> its <b>grain</b> supplies from the more distant Argentina, but since Argentina will {{only be able to}} deliver very limited quantities, because of the poor harvest, England will have to turn to India and mostly Australia. In the attachment it is explained in detail how such an increase in the length of the grain routes will require an extra 720,000 tons of tonnage for the grain shipments alone. In practice, the implications will be that, until August 1917, 3/4 million tons of the available 10 million tons will have to be employed for a service, which had hitherto not been required.|$|R
40|$|The {{grading system}} {{in use in}} Canada {{establishes}} a financial incentive that influences a rational elevator agent to ship out grain with a quality level situated along a minimum quality line. This enables the elevator manager to generate rents by blending grain, but {{how much of the}} rents the agent keeps and how much is passed back to the producer depends to a large extent on the competition in place at the elevator's location. Thus the central issue becomes one of reflection and of determining the conditions under which rents generated in the normal course of an elevator's daily operations are passed back to farmers. The issues that are examined in this study are as follows: (1) What {{is the nature of the}} competition that arises as elevating firms and farmers compete for rents? (2) Who ultimately captures these rents? (3) The spatial configuration (structure) of the grain market on the Prairies is changing rapidly. These changes will effect the competition between elevators and the well-being of farmers. By examining the nature of the competition in a cross-sectional setting, is it possible to draw some inference for the effects of this changing structure? The study used data of deliveries to and from 130 elevators located on the Prairie provinces of Canada. The results of the study found that elevator managers most likely use blending rents as a tool to <b>draw</b> <b>grain</b> deliveries to their elevators. The highly competitive nature of the industry suggests that non-competitive behaviour by elevator companies generally is not possible, except possibly in some remote areas where few elevators are present. This conclusion has obvious implications on the net returns to farmers as more elevators are being closed down to be replaced by fewer but larger elevators. No inferences could be drawn on whether or not elevators have an added ability to generate rents depending on the variability of the quality of the grain delivered to the elevator as too many unquantifiable variables play a part in this process. A strong inference could be drawn that High Throughput (HTP) elevators, in relation to other conventional elevators, have an effect on blending rent retention. This finding has obvious important implications for the future, since much of the grain elevation needs of Prairie farmers in the future will be met by HTP elevators. However, the fact that HTP elevators often provide farmers with alternate benefits such as trucking fees also needs to be taken into account. Any positive rents generated in these elevators must therefore be counter weighed by the other benefits that may flow to farmers. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

With a more sensitive apparatus, {{we find that}} this surge depends on hopper diameter and also happens in air [...] - though the effect is smaller and previously unnoticed. We also find that the surge may be turned off by fixing the rate of fluid flow through the granular packing. With no flow control, dye injected {{on top of the}} packing gets <b>drawn</b> into the <b>grains,</b> at a rate that increases as the hopper empties. Thus we conclude that the surge is caused by a self-generated pumping of fluid through the packing. We successfully model this effect via a driving pressure set by the dilation of grains as they exit. This highlights a surprising and unrecognized role that interstitial fluid plays in setting the discharge rate, and likely also in controlling clog formation, for granular hoppers whether in air or under water.

40|$|International audienceA three-dimensional, {{transient}} and multiscale {{mathematical model}} has been presented, which is able to reveal the coupled physical fields in the electroslag remelting (ESR) process. The mold {{is assumed to be}} conductive rather than insulated. The electric current, Lorentz force and Joule heating fields were demonstrated by Maxwell’s equations. The volume of fluid (VOF) approach was implemented for the metal droplet behavior. The solidification was modeled by an enthalpy-porosity formulation, in which the mushy zone was treated as a porous medium with porosity equal to the liquid fraction. Besides, the solute distribution was revealed by the continuum mixture model. The macro-model was linked to a meso-model through the flow and temperature fields. A regular network of square cells with a much finer scale was <b>drawn</b> for the <b>grain</b> structure with the cellular automaton (CA) technique. The continuous nucleation, which is based on the Gaussian distribution, was implemented to describe the heterogeneous nucleation. The growth kinetics of the dendritic tip was taken into account by the Kure-Giovanola-Trivedi (KGT) model. Moreover, a moving mesh was carried out to account the growing of ingot. The electric current flows to the mold lateral wall especially in the slag layer. A large amount of Joule heating around the metal droplet varies as it falls. The hottest region appears under the outer radius of the electrode tip, close to the slag/metal interface instead of the electrode tip. The metal pool becomes deeper with more power. The maximal temperature increases from 1951 K to 2015 K, and the maximum metal pool depth increases from 34. 0 mm to 59. 5 mm with the applied current ranging from 1000 A to 2000 A.

40|$|One of the {{ultimate}} goals in particle accelerator cavity design {{is to establish a}} model that integrates the grain orientations of an ingot slice, slip activity during deep drawing, and dislocation substructure evolution because of slip system interactions, which governs subsequent recrystallization. In order to understand the slip behavior during deep <b>drawing</b> of large <b>grain</b> Nb, it is first necessary to know how slip occurs in the uniaxial tension of single crystal Nb. In this study, the slip behavior of Nb samples taken from an ingot slice before and after an 800 ºC/ 2 h anneal is compared. The as-cut specimens were deformed monotonically to 40 % engineering strain using a tensile tester (Instron 4302). The heat treated specimens were deformed in an SEM in situ using an Ernest Fullam stage, with strain increments of ~ 10 %, and held in a loaded condition while microscopy measurements were made. After the heat treatment, the yield strengths decreased significantly for almost all specimens, and there was no longer a slight drop of flow stress between yield and 15 % strain which is present in several of the as-received specimens. This implies that the dislocations initially present in the ingot {{play an important role in}} deformation, and that the heat treatment effectively removed many dislocations. In most cases, the deformation paths for corresponding specimens exhibit a different sense of rotation, even though the specimens have nearly identical starting orientations. This implies that pre-existing dislocations affected which slip systems were activated during deformation. Although the initial orientation differences were small, the pre-existing dislocations led to final orientations that differed by more than 10 ? after 40 % strain. There is a noticeable prevalence of { 110 } slip in the heat treated specimens as compared to a dominance of { 112 } slip for the as-received specimens. This provides evidence that existing dislocations lead to conditions that favor operation of slip on { 112 } planes. Very linear slip traces were observed on the heat treated specimens, while there was a range of slip trace inclinations observed in the as-received group, which suggests that pre-existing dislocation entanglements may have led to bursts of slip on different planes in the same Burgers vector direction...|$|R
40|$|The Mid Sweden University in Sundsvall, Sweden is a {{proof that}} in {{architecture}} {{much can be}} offered by such values as human scale, context, wit, wealth of forms and places created for meeting people. Arken Arkitekter have proposed {{a new type of}} a higher-education institution which would make close contact with its users. In this new formula, context is sought in history and the landscape. The 13, 000 sqm complex is a kind of settlement linking the town with its outskirts. From the town, the school is accessed via two new pedestrian bridges which tie in with the existing system of footpaths and alleys. The area of 19, 600 sqm of the campus descends in steps into the Selängersan river meander. Trees and good access for vehicles create the unique quality of the place. The design was selected in 1992, in a competition for university branches for 5, 000 students. The architectural concept shows affinity with the Swedish tradition of granaries. Several of these old structures can still be seen in the port of Sundsvall. The new building resembles them in that its gable walls face the water, and also in such elements as brick walls, mansards, or the characte¬ristic chimneys. The building does not attempt to dominate its surroun¬dings by its form, volume or height, although it could be entitled to such domination, considering its function. It does however endow the neighbouring houses with some of its noble character. The various parts of the building were designed {{in such a way as}} to minimize its impact on the existing natural surroundings, so that some of its dimen¬sions were actually dictated by the distances between trees. At a glance, the solid with massive protrusions may resemble a multicoloured terraced-house development. It is a joke of sorts, with a double meaning. This makes one think of the vision of a university in the modem world. The Sundsvall school is a contrast to the image of other higher-education institutions seen as temples, factories, or even supermarkets, where knowledge is bought ano¬nymously. Decentralised places which are perfect for meetings reflect the diversity of liberated education. It is a "granary" school whence anyone can freely <b>draw</b> the <b>grain</b> of knowledge, as much as they need or can carry away. The structuring of the building is not chaotic, as it might seem at first, but quite a harmonious system. The two wings of the building, buckled together by the cylinder of the rotunda, are placed on the slope descending towards the river. The level difference has been used brilliantly here. At the altitude of the main entrance, the university embraces the central court in its “arms. " Hence, steep footpaths will lead you a level lower, towards the promenade along the river—from which the lowest level entrances can be accessed. This level, partly underground, houses classrooms, a restaurant, and technical services. A corridor links all faculties. Owing to the fact that the underground spine of the school runs under the alleys and the squares, the whole makes an impression of several independent buildings. This is how the interior is literally interwoven with the exterior. A key point in Arken Arkitekter's considerations was the grading of privacy. Open places include well-lit, large atriums, linking the independent faculty units. During long Scandinavian winters, a special quality of these places is the possibility of having contact with the surrounding nature—vegetation and the sky—without leaving the building. What’s surprising is the multitude of materials used and some juxtapositions of textures and colours. Architects say that the Sundsvall University should be a granary accu¬mulating various materials and climates. Natural materials prevail, all in warm tones, hardly processed. Is this just careless play? I don’t think so. Such an ambience in a school goes well with respect for the diversity of students’ characters and personalities. The places which have been created definitely cannot be called anonymous. The Stockholm-based architects showed that postmodernist experiments with materials are closer to man than the tasteful but boring seriousness of the minimalists. This architecture works not so much for the students as with them. The spirit of persuasion for the sake of the only truth is not found here. No dominating central point is sensed either. Instead, numerous places have been offered—yes, not imposed, but offered. The ingeniously designed niches with benches and tables are scattered throughout the building and around it. They encourage people to meet and talk, and to exchange opinions which is the most essential element of education. Too many schools have been built based on a plan resembling a production line. A school is not a factory. At a time when lots of architects are susceptible to the idea that a mile of glass is beautiful, and two miles of it are just gorgeous, isn’t there a more important task for the architect to create places where people can and want to meet...|$|R
