50|$|The opaque projector, epidioscope, <b>epidiascope</b> or {{episcope}} is {{a device}} which displays opaque materials by shining a bright lamp onto the object from above. A system of mirrors, prisms and/or imaging lenses {{is used to}} focus {{an image of the}} material onto a viewing screen. Because they must project the reflected light, opaque projectors require brighter bulbs and larger lenses than overhead projectors. Care must be taken that the materials are not damaged by the heat generated by the light source. Opaque projectors are not as common as the overhead projector.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-20th century, Ross {{continued}} to produce lenses, {{as well as}} binoculars, <b>epidiascopes,</b> etc. They had begun supplying lenses for Ensign cameras in the 1930s and after World War II Ross merged with Barnet Ensign, and the company later became Ross Ensign, lenses were also made for other companies such as MPP.|$|R
50|$|Rajindra Hospital, Patiala with 20900 beds was {{attached}} to the college in early 1951. The hospital is equipped with all the latest apparatus and instruments to make it fit for imparting clinical teaching to the students. Two well designed, spacious and well lighted lecture theatres equipped with arrangements for <b>epidiascopes</b> projections and audio visual aids are provided on the hospital side in addition to four lecture theatres of similar design on college side for basic departments.|$|R
50|$|Document cameras {{replaced}} <b>epidiascopes</b> {{and overhead}} projectors, which were formerly {{used for this}} purpose. By means of the zoom feature a document camera can enlarge the small print in books and project a printed page {{as if it were}} a traditional transparency. Also the room lighting does not have to be darkened to operate a document camera; in a classroom setting this is an asset. Most document cameras can also send a video signal to a computer via USB cable. Sometimes document cameras are connected to an interactive whiteboard instead of a standard screen.|$|R
5000|$|The Independent Group had {{its first}} meeting early in 1952 which {{consisted}} of artist and sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi feeding a mass of colourful images from American magazines through an <b>epidiascope.</b> These images, composed of advertising, comic strips and assorted graphics, were collected when Paolozzi was resident in Paris from 1947-49. Much of the material was assembled as scrapbook collages and {{formed the basis of}} his BUNK! series of screenprints (1972) and the Krazy Kat Archives now held at the V & A Museum, London. In fact, Paolozzi's seminal 1947 collage I was a Rich Man's Plaything was the first such [...] "found object" [...] material to contain the word ″pop″ and is considered the initial standard bearer of “Pop Art”. The rest of the first Independent Group session concentrated on philosophy and technology during September 1952 to June 1953, and was chaired by design critic and historian, Reyner Banham. Key members at this stage included Paolozzi, the artist Richard Hamilton, surrealist and magazine art director Toni del Renzio, sculptor William Turnbull, the photographer Nigel Henderson and fine artist John McHale, along with the art critic Lawrence Alloway.|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} to detect directional hypokinesia is proposed. Subjects with unilateral neglect were administered cancellation tests with an <b>epidiascope</b> used to dissociate visual input from motor output. Two different cancellation tasks were performed {{in order to}} compare this technique with the method devised by Tegner and Levander [Brain 114, 1943 - 1951, 1991]. No difference in detecting hypokinetic deficits was observed; however, our method was easier to perform and more suitable for clinical testing...|$|E
30|$|Each erosion feature was {{delineated}} on photographic prints using a fine mapping pen, {{assigned a}} unique number, {{and the failure}} type (debris avalanche, soil slip, stream bank collapse or landing failure) was noted. The first three types are considered as natural phenomena while the latter is associated with harvesting activities. Using an <b>epidiascope</b> to adjust for minor differences in scale, mapped areas were then transferred from the photographs onto a base map. A 1 : 10, 000 scale base map was created from a 1 : 25, 000 scale topo plot (New Zealand Map Series 270, part Sheet T 11) to match the scale of both the aerial photographs, and the forest compartment maps. The latter were geo-referenced to the New Zealand Map Grid 1949 projection.|$|E
40|$|During {{the seminar}} discussions, {{especially}} those built around artefacts and photographs, I {{became interested in}} the special tools of classrooms, their presence in rooms and cupboards {{and the ways in which}} they were used by teachers and pupils. I remembered from my own teaching experience the <b>epidiascope</b> I had used in my first year in an innovative social studies dept, my final encounter with a Gestetner printer, the use of coloured pens, the two day closing of a wing of the school to make a film recording of a single teaching lesson, the whistle used in the corridor to change social studies topics [...] . Then I thought of the form of the lessons in social studies, the combination of discussion, worksheets and groupwork, which took place across the age range within late Edwardian classrooms and how it emerged and was kept in place. Past accounts I had collected from teachers followed: were there stores of now unused educational film slides somewhere? what di...|$|E
40|$|Shrinkage {{is a very}} {{important}} physical property of soils owing to its influence on water balance and related consequences both on soil conservation and agronomic management. As a particular agricultural problem, shrinkage becomes important in soils with a high content of expanding types of clays, where large and deep cracks influence the root systems and therefore crop yields. Several new methods have been devised in recent years to investigate soil shrinkage (Koepf, 1960; Franzmeier & Ross, 1968; Groenevelt, 1974). The present study was undertaken to accomplish a less time consuming measurement of shrinkage by means of electro optical equipment (Leitz Classimat). The apparatus is similar to a Quantimet-B previously used by Jongerius (1972) for soil porosity investigation; it consists of an <b>epidiascope,</b> where the image of a shrunken sample is projected upon the photosensitive layer of a television camera, an electronic signal processing unit which analyses the video signals, and a monitor where the analysed image is also visible. The measured ata can be digitally displayed and directly fed to an electronic omputer (Olivetti P 602). A simplified diagram is presented in Fig. 1. Following the shrinkage development was considered the best way to estimate the performance of the instrument and clay with a high content of montmorillonite was selected as the most suitable sample in order to enhance this process. The investigations were carried out using clay samples from the Uri Bentonite Optical-,,,, [...] Television macroscopic image ca mera...|$|E
