40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the accounting duties for the middle accounting units, which have come after the amendment to the Accounting Act. The theoretical part is focused on accounting regulation, its methods and instruments {{in the form of}} <b>directives.</b> Subsequently, <b>individual</b> <b>directives,</b> their changes and their cancellations are described together with the transposition process into national law. The theoretical part also includes the amendment to the Accounting Act and the list of substantial changes effective from 1 st January 2016, particularly the categorization of accounting units and their duties. In the practical section, the internal directives of particular accounitng unit are analysed and changes are introduced together with new obligations that the accounting unit must obey after the amendment to the Accounting Act...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis was to analyse intradepartment {{accounting}} directives chosen allowance organisation Elementary School and Kindergarten Košetice. The basis for the entire work was to define procedures for creating and registration directives, determinate basic procedural requirements and to characterize the content of <b>individual</b> <b>directives.</b> These findings are followed in the practical part, in which the analysis of eight intradepartment accounting directives, that the organization has established, was made out. It was found out if directives have all their formal treatment, prescribed requirements, completeness and timeliness under applicable law. After analysing and evaluating two directives were chosen, concretely directives for the registration and accounting of {{tangible and intangible assets}} and inventory and directives for the provision and billing of travel expenses that have been updated. The remaining directives were added with recommendations of how the missing data should be complemented by the directives.

50|$|Examples of Sippenhaft {{being used}} as a threat exist within the Wehrmacht from around 1943. Soldiers accused of having 'blood impurities' or {{soldiers}} conscripted from areas outside of Germany also began to have their families threatened and punished with Sippenhaft. An example is the case of Panzergrenadier Wenzeslaus Leiss, who was accused of desertion on the Eastern Front in December 1942. After the Düsseldorf Gestapo discovered supposed 'Polish' links in the Leiss family, in February 1943 his wife, two-year-old daughter, two brothers, sister and brother-in-law were arrested and executed at Sachsenhausen concentration camp. By 1944, several general and <b>individual</b> <b>directives</b> were ordered within divisions and corps, threatening troops with consequences against their family. After 20 July 1944 these threats were extended to include all German troops and in particular, German commanders. A decree of February 1945 threatened death to the relatives of military commanders who showed what Hitler regarded as cowardice or defeatism {{in the face of the}} enemy. After surrendering Königsberg to the Soviets in April 1945, the family of the German commander General Otto Lasch were arrested. These arrests were publicized in the Völkischer Beobachter.|$|R
40|$|The Consumer Loan Contract and its Securing by Suretyship As is self-evident {{from the}} title of the thesis, {{the subject matter of the}} thesis is the {{analysis}} of the concept of consumer credit and the securing thereof through suretyship. The starting point of the thesis was the newly-adopted Consumer Credit Act, which came into force on 1 January 2012. The aim of this thesis is to acquaint its readers with the relevant legislation, point out its shortcomings, and analyse the concept of suretyship as the most typical instrument used to secure consumer credit obligations, thus giving the reader a full picture of these legal concepts. The thesis is divided into nine chapters. The first chapter describes a contractual relationship under the credit contract, which is governed by legal regulations similar to those governing a consumer credit contract or a loan contract. This chapter analyses the essential terms of a credit contract, its origination and termination. Also analysed are the differences between a credit contract and a loan contract under the Civil Code. The second chapter describes the history of the consumer credit concept, in both domestic and European contexts. Particular emphasis is given to the <b>individual</b> <b>directives</b> of the European Community, currently the European Union, since they are of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Users {{are often}} {{considered}} the weakest {{link in the}} security chain because of their natural propensity for choosing convenience over safe practice. One area with {{a vast amount of}} evidence related to poor user behaviour is that of password management. We {{have a pretty good idea}} of the extent to which careless user behaviour impacts on the individual user’s personal security. However, we do not fully understand the impact on the organisation as a whole when such laxity is aggregated across a large number of employees, nor do we know how best to intervene so as to improve the level of protection of critical systems. Current wisdom mandates the use of increasingly draconian policies to curb insecure user behaviours but it is clear that this approach has limited effectiveness. Unfortunately, no one really understands how the <b>individual</b> <b>directives</b> contained in these policies impact on the security of an organisation’s systems. Sometimes a mandated tightening of policy can have unexpected side-effects which are not easily anticipated and may indeed prove entirely counterproductive. It would be very difficult to investigate these issues in a real-life environment so here we describe a simulation model, which seeks to replicate a typical organisation, with employee agents using a number of systems over an extended period. The model is configurable, allowing adjustment of particular input parameters in order to reflect different policy dictats so as to determine their impact on the security of the simulated organisation’s systems. This tool will support security specialists developing policies within their organisations by quantifying the longitudinal impacts of particular rules...|$|R
40|$|During {{the first}} and second weeks of February 2008, {{as a part of the}} member country energy policy review of the International Energy Agency (IEA), a visit for {{in-depth}} review was conducted for the EU committee, at which I was an expert from Japan. Based on the experience and observations of the review, I attempt to analyze and explain the current status of the European common energy policy and the issues surrounding it. With regard to the European common energy policy, the situation to date has been that <b>individual</b> <b>directives</b> have been issued for each issue, and a comprehensive energy policy was finally agreed on and shaped in 2007. This European common energy policy is characterized by a unique policy method in which ambitious policy targets are laid down and efforts of individual member countries to achieve them are urged, for example ownership unbundling of gas and electricity supply and distribution, and the achievement of three 20 % targets by 2020 with regard to energy and environmental issues. However, the state of implementation and compliance in individual member countries of past directives such as gas and electricity liberalization, renewable energy, and energy-efficiency are in far from a satisfactory condition. For example it has been observed that, with regard to certain energy policy directives where the actual situation deviates from past targets, these have simply been switched to other long-term targets. Nothing is as hollow as setting policy targets that are not accompanied by sound implementation and compliance. Currently, in individual policies there is seen some partial strengthening of legal force and postponement of targets, but there still remains a concern that unless there is drastic improvement with respect to their implementation and compliance, the European common energy policy could be reduced to being merely a formal procedure for political decisions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Theses was to {{investigate}} the effect of play therapy on children whose parents are either divorced or divorcing. This study is qualitative, adopting a casuistic approach. In the theoretical part, the stages of divorce, child's adaptation to divorce and <b>individual</b> non- <b>directive</b> play therapy are described. The practical part consists of five case studies showing practical application of play therapy. The analysis is based on ten cases (children aged three to nine years, four boys and six girls). Data were analyzed using open, axial and selective coding. Play therapy for children in divorce situations is an appropriate therapy tool for children whose both parents agree with the treatment and the child meets the indications. Children respond positively to play therapy, they express the family conflict. The results of the study open possibility for further research in the field of non-directive play therapy. Key words: play therapy, non-directive individual play therapy, divorce, adaptation to divorc...|$|R

50|$|Regarding the {{territorial}} {{scope of the}} Directive, the Court observed that Google Spain is a subsidiary of Google Inc. on Spanish territory and, therefore, an 'establishment' {{within the meaning of}} the directive. The Court rejected Google Inc.'s argument that it was not carrying out its data processing in Spain, holding that the promotion and selling of advertising space by its subsidiary Google Spain was sufficient to constitute processing within the meaning of the Directive. To have ruled otherwise would have been to undermine the effectiveness of the Directive and the fundamental rights and freedoms of <b>individuals</b> that the <b>Directive</b> seeks to ensure. The Court thus endorsed the Advocate General's view that Google Inc. and Google Spain should be treated as a single economic unit.|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} study aims {{to identifying}} the reasoning ways of students {{relative to the}} concept of electrostatic field. At first, we suggested interpreting the support of students reasoning by a ‘dualistic model’ associating the existence of an electrostatic field with presence of two types of charges: a source charge and a test charge. We finally analysed students reasoning in terms of modelling process in diversified situations. Our theoretical framework leans on the ‘theory of the modelling’ developed in didactics of the physics by Tiberghien (1994). Our analyses of semi <b>directive</b> <b>individual</b> interviews lead to consider that the students implement a model of reasoning which takes support on a concrete element which allows mediating the relationship between the objects and events world and of the theories and the models world...|$|R
5000|$|As of 1973, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{standard}} for transponder minimal operational performance, Technical Standard Order (TSO) C74c, contained errors which caused compatibility problems with {{air traffic control}} radar beacon system (ATCRBS) radar and Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) abilities to detect aircraft transponders. First called [...] "The Terra Problem", there have since been <b>individual</b> FAA Airworthiness <b>Directives</b> issued against various transponder manufacturers {{in an attempt to}} repair the operational deficiencies, to enable newer radars and TCAS systems to operate. Unfortunately, the defect is in the TSO, and the individual corrective actions to transponders have led to significant differences in the logical behavior of transponders by make and mark, as proven by an FAA study of in-situ transponders. In 2009, a new version, TSO C74d was defined with tighter technical requirements.|$|R
40|$|Advance {{directives}} are {{instructions on}} health care. Executed by a mentally competent <b>individual,</b> an advance <b>directive</b> becomes {{active in the}} event that the person loses mental capacity to make health care decisions. Many social workers have embraced advance directives on the basis that they promote self-determination at the end of life. However, on closer inspection, undergirding the rationale for advance directives are complex philosophical theories and concepts that include: self-determination; the good death; congruity between the former mentally competent person and the current incapacitated self; and ethics of care. This paper discusses the philosophy, more specifically, bioethics—the discipline that deals with ethical questions that result from advances in medicine—as it relates to advance directives. In order to contextualize the discussion on a macro level, the United States will be used as a case study. Clinical examples will present ideological conflicts that have the potential to result in social work practice dilemmas. Addressed also are recommendations for social workers in both direct and indirect practice...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} testing of a theoretically plausible model of antecedents and consequences of workplace interpersonal mistreatment using archival data (n = 10697) of civilian and military employees. The sample was split into calibration and validation samples. Principle component and confirmatory factor analysis revealed a complex structure for the workplace interpersonal mistreatment construct across three types of behaviour, and across observed and experienced mistreatment. Furthermore, a total of 17 robust factors were identified in the survey, of which a subset of eight factors was used for developing the model of antecedents and consequences of WIM. The model was tested and refined using regression and structural equation modelling in two samples and validated in a third sample. <b>Individual</b> (seniority), workplace (<b>directive</b> leadership, equity and diversity climate, and health and safety climate) and organisational features (aligned-cohesive culture, service culture) all predict mistreatment. Outcomes of mistreatment include stress, organisational commitment, job satisfaction and leaving intentions. The model showed good fit in the validation sample and is therefore likely to generalise to the population. Implications for organisations and recommendations for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Currently, four-and-a-half million Americans are {{afflicted with}} Alzheimer’s Disease, {{accounting}} for {{roughly half the}} cases of adult dementia, and fourteen million cases are projected by mid-century. With the coalescence of the baby boomers, managed health care, and increasingly scarce health care resources, our society must brace to face a social and legal policy challenge of enormous importance and complexity. In this circumstance, the inevitable call for access to physician-assisted suicide, likely triggered through some form of living will, {{will need to be}} considered within a context far different than the current focus of the assisted-suicide debate on terminal illness. Asserting the position that {{it is not possible to}} create a workable regulatory regime to legally control physician-assisted suicide (PAS) for the demented, the author posits that the false cultural myth characterizing the demented as “empty shells” diverts us from carefully examining the insurmountable difficulties with allowing PAS for dementia. The author proceeds to debunk this myth, first considering experiences of caregivers, and then demonstrating how these anecdotal stories are in line with both philosophical constructions of personhood, and current psychological theories of the self. Finally, the author explains why meaningful consent to PAS by dementia sufferers is not possible, and he cautions against attempting PAS through advance directives for dementia. Far from protecting the interests of the demented <b>individual,</b> such <b>directives</b> will give what the author terms “total interpretive discretion” over the life or death of the demented person to caregivers who will often have societal misconceptions about dementia or who will ascribe troublesome behavior to manifestations of the disease rather than to clumsy attempts to communicate needs. The author instead urges positive investment in education and research as a bulwark against increased demand and sanction of PAS for dementia as the elder population expands in coming decades...|$|R
40|$|The {{present report}} reviews the {{fundamental}} {{right to privacy}} and data protection which shall be assured to <b>individuals</b> and the <b>Directive</b> 95 / 46 /EC which provides more detailed rules on how to establish protection {{in the case of}} biometric data processing. The present framework does not seem apt to cope with all issues and problems raised by biometric applications. The limited recent case law of the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice sheds some light on some relevant issues, but does not answer all questions. The report provides an analysis of the use of biometric data and the applicable current legal framework in six countries. The research demonstrates that in various countries, position is taken against the central storage of biometric data because of the various additional risks such storage entails. Furthermore, some countries stress the risks of the use of biometric characteristics which leave traces (such as e. g., fingerprint, face, voice…). In general, controllers of biometric applications receive limited clear guidance as to how implement biometric applications. Because of conflicting approaches, general recommendations are made in this report with regard to the regulation of central storage of biometric data and various other aspects, including the need for transparency of biometric systems...|$|R
2500|$|Both Wilson and Eisenhower entered office {{committed}} to reorganizing the Department of Defense. They succeeded in securing from Congress approval in June 1953 of Reorganization Plan No. 6, which made changes in OSD, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and {{the chain of}} command. Wilson welcomed the reorganization plan, which became effective on June 30, 1953, as facilitating more efficient management of the Department of Defense. He looked on the assistant secretaries as his [...] "vice presidents" [...] and tried to run the Pentagon like an industrial corporation. Wilson {{took advantage of the}} reorganization to decentralize administration, giving the service secretaries more responsibility and importance. In his first annual report, he noted that the service secretaries were his principal assistants; decentralizing operational responsibility to them would make for effective exercise of civilian authority throughout DoD. In July 1954, to complement the 1953 reorganization, Wilson issued a directive to the JCS, the most important provision of which stated that [...] "the Joint Staff work of each of the Chiefs of Staff shall take priority over all other duties", namely their tasks as chiefs of <b>individual</b> services. The <b>directive</b> also clarified the role of the JCS chairman and his authority over the Joint Staff while making clear that assignment of major tasks to the Joint Staff was the prerogative of the full JCS.|$|R
40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed for collecting fine-grained employee commute origination data from employers in major employment centers. Many U. S. multinational firms have adopted the European Parliament Privacy Directive 95 / 46 /EC, the strictest privacy law to date. The methodology discussed complies with this Directive. “Fine-grained ” is defined as providing sufficient resolution (approximately 1, 000 feet) to assist transportation planning of <b>individual</b> bus stops. <b>Directive</b> 95 / 46 /EC provides for “anonymization ” of data to where the data subject is no longer identifiable. Individual address data is aggregated to a 1 / 5 by 1 / 5 mile grid at the employer site using commercial geographic information systems software. Once the grid data is taken from employer premises, data is combined {{with those of other}} employers, providing further anonymization. 8, 200 out of approximately 20, 000 worker addresses have been collected from the Stanford Research Park employment center in Palo Alto, California using this methodology. While the sprawling spatial distribution of these addresses challenges many Transportation Demand Reduction strategies, planned transit system improvements should result in a significant patronage increase. This methodology could be automated and applied nationally by the U. S. Census Bureau as part of their Transportation Planning Package, creating higher quality transportation data for improved investment decision making, ridesharing, and transit routing. THE SETTING Stanford Research Park (SRP), located in Palo Alto, California, is counted among the nation and world’s leading scientific research employment centers.

40|$|There is a puzzling, little-remarked {{contradiction in}} {{scholarly}} {{views of the}} European Commission. On the one hand, the Commission {{is seen as the}} maestro of European integration, gently but persistently guiding both governments and firms toward Brussels. On the other hand, the Commission is portrayed as a headless bunch of bickering fiefdoms who can hardly be bothered by anything but their own in­ ternecine turf wars. The reason these very different views of the same institution have so seldom come into conflict is quite apparent: EU studies has a set of relatively autonomous and poorly integrated sub­ fields that work at different levels of analysis. Those scholars holding the "heroic" view of the Com­ mission are generally focused on the contest between national and supranational levels that character­ ized the 1992 program and subsequent major steps toward European integration. By contrast, those scholars with the "bureaucratic politics" view are generally authors of case studies or legislative his­ tories of <b>individual</b> EU <b>directives</b> or decisions. However, the fact that these twO images of the Commis­ sion are often two ships passing in the night hardly implies that there is no dispute. Clearly both views cannot be right; but then, how can we explain the significant support each enjoys from the empirical record? The CommiSSion, perhaps the single most important supranational body in the world, certainly deserves better than the schizophrenic interpretation the EU studies community has given it. In this paper, I aim to make a contribution toward the unraveling of this paradox. In brief, the argument I make is as follows: the European Commission can be effective in pursuit of its broad integration goals in spite of, and even because of, its internal divisions. The folk wisdom that too many chefs spoil the broth may often be true, but it need not always be so. The paper is organized as follows. 1 begin with an elaboration of the theoretical position briefly out­ lined above. 1 then tum to a case study from the major Commission efforts to restructure the computer industry in the context of its 1992 program. The computer sector does not merely provide interesting, random illustrations of the hypothesis 1 have advanced. Rather, as Wayne Sandholtz and John Zysman have stressed, the Commission's efforts on informatics formed one of the most crucial parts of the en­ tire 1992 program, and so the Commission's success in "Europeanizing" these issues had significant ripple effects across the entire European political economy. I conclude with some thoughts on the fol­ lowing question: now that the Commission has succeeded in bringing the world to its doorstep, does its bureaucratic division still serve a useful purpose...|$|R
40|$|Provision of {{reproductive}} services to individuals infected with HIV- 1 is gaining popular acceptance and is generally endorsed by specialists in reproductive medicine. In {{the situation in}} which the male is HIV positive and the female partner is not infected, a large body of evidence has demonstrated that the use of assisted reproductive technology is effective for achieving pregnancy, while eliminating the risk of viral transmission to the mother and fetus. No reports have documented the well-being of the HIV-infected partners subsequent to seeking fertility services. In the current report, we document the cases of five HIV-positive men who died secondary to complications of HIV infection shortly after participating in the assisted reproduction program for HIV- 1 –serodiscordant couples at Columbia University. Three of these couples successfully achieved pregnancy and live birth, including one set of triplets, and one case of posthumous conception; the fourth case resulted in the cryopreservation of all embryos after the sudden death of the male before the time of embryo transfer; the fifth couple failed to conceive. None of the deaths, which occurred within a few months to 2 years from initial consultation, were related to infertility treatment. The demographic and social statuses of these patients were not different from the general population of men seeking assisted reproduction in our clinic. Regarding the HIV infection status of these cases, three patients had a longer duration of infection compared to the general population of men in our cohort, and one had a significantly lower CD 4 cell count. All five men had stable HIV viral loads, and were determined by their primary care providers to be clinically healthy at the time of entry into the program for assisted reproduction. The untimely deaths of these patients underscores the importance of the thoughtful consideration of the complex issues involved in family planning for these <b>individuals,</b> including advanced <b>directives</b> for the use of cryopreserved gametes and embryos, and the social, emotional, and practical issues for the children and surviving partners subsequent to the death of the HIV-positive parent...|$|R
