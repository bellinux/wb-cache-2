5|$|Mini Metro was {{conceived}} in April 2013 for {{a video game}} development competition, with a prototype version being released freely for web browsers. During the game's conception phase, the developers imposed a set of constraints to limit its scope and ensure the project could reach a <b>finished</b> <b>state.</b> Production of the game continued following the event and an in-development version was released commercially on Linux, OS X, and Windows in August 2014. Mini Metro received its full release on PC platforms in November 2015, and on Android and iOS platforms in October 2016. The game received a positive reception from critics, with praise directed towards its intuitive interface, simple gameplay, and minimalist approach.|$|E
5|$|The men's and women's tennis {{programs}} {{have also had}} many successful years. The {{programs have}} remained as two of the more competitive tennis teams in the WAC for several decades. The women's program experienced their most successful season in 1994 in which they <b>finished</b> <b>state</b> runner-up. The men's program won 10 consecutive WAC championships from 1994 to 2003. In 1999, former head coach Bob Krug was named NFCA Midwest Region Coach of the Year. The streak in WAC Championships ended during the 2003–04 school year, but the Buffs rebounded and won three more consecutive WAC championships from 2005 to 2007. The Buffs added WAC Championship titles in 2011 and 2014. The tennis program has sent numerous players to the state tournament throughout the program's history.|$|E
5|$|Within the week, {{they had}} a working game written in Adobe Flash's ActionScript 2. The two agreed to {{complete}} it out as a game they could release on Steam though with no expectations of sales. Completion of the game from the prototype to the <b>finished</b> <b>state</b> took about 3 months with part-time development. During this time, they discovered there were several limitations on the {{size and scope of}} both Flash and ActionScript that limited how much they could do with the game, but continued to use the tools as to release the title. McMillen said that because they were not worried about sales, they were able to work with Valve to release the game without fears of censorship or having to seek an ESRB rating. Releasing through Steam also enabled them to update the game freely, several times on its initial release, an aspect that they could not do with other consoles without significant cost to themselves. They did release without significant end-user testing, as it would have taken several hundreds of users to go through all the various combinations of items that a player could collect, and McMillen recognized they had released the title with their buyers being playtesters for them. A week after the Steam release, McMillen released a demo version via the website Newgrounds. Merge Games produced a physical edition that included the game, soundtrack, and a poster, for stores in the United Kingdom in 2012.|$|E

25|$|Many benches use {{different}} species of woods together. Small business woodworkers who work in a store-front sometimes use various species so that their clients can see examples of the different woods in a <b>finished</b> <b>state.</b> If this is done, {{it is important to}} use woods that are compatible with each other - particularly in the area of relative movement. Otherwise changes in temperature and humidity will stress the structure out of shape or it may even break.|$|E
25|$|Mass {{finishing}} processes can be configured {{as either}} batch systems, in which batches of workpieces are added, run, and removed {{before the next}} batch is run, or as continuous systems, in which the workpieces enter {{at one end and}} leave at the other end in the <b>finished</b> <b>state.</b> They may also be sequenced, which involves running the workpieces through multiple different mass finishing processes; usually, the finish becomes progressively finer. Due to the random action of the processes, mass finishing is as much an art as it is a science.|$|E
25|$|The {{appendices}} to The Lord of the Rings {{were brought}} to a <b>finished</b> <b>state</b> in 1953–54, but a decade later, during preparations {{for the release of}} the Second Edition, Tolkien elaborated the events that had led to the Kin-strife and introduced the regency of Rómendacil II. The final development of the history and geographical nature of Gondor took place around 1970, {{in the last years of}} Tolkien's life, when he invented justifications for the place-names and wrote full narratives for the stories of Isildur's death and of the battles with the Wainriders and the Balchoth (published in Unfinished Tales).|$|E

500|$|A {{version for}} Mac OS, ported by Logicware, was {{announced}} but never released. Captivation Digital Laboratories, Inc. was slated {{to develop a}} port to the Dreamcast, to be released {{near the end of}} 2000. The Dreamcast version revamped the graphics of the game with double the polygon count of the original models. Like Opposing Force for PC and Decay for PlayStation 2, the Dreamcast version was set to have its own exclusive expansion, Blue Shift. However, after many delays, the Dreamcast version was canceled in June 2001 due to [...] "changing market conditions". The Blue Shift expansion was then preserved and ported over to become Half-Life [...] for PC.

500|$|Despite this progress, Axel Rappe left as Minister for War in 1899, due to {{setbacks}} {{on other}} issues.

Crusebjörn followed {{in the footsteps of}} Rappedescribed as [...] "the spiritual father of Boden Fortress" [...] thanks to his effortsas he proposed, in accordance with the Committee's plan, that the Riksdag should allocate an initial sum of 560,000 kronor which would be used to initiate construction of Boden Fortress. Crusebjörn also maintained the belief of his predecessor, and of the committee in which he was chairman, that Boden Fortress when completed should act as the operational base for all troops attached for the defence of Norrbotten, that it should serve as a supply fortress for troops stationed between it and the front line, and that it also should serve as a blocking fortress in case of a Russian surprise attack. The 1897 committee also had set the goal to have Boden Fortress in a <b>finished</b> <b>state</b> when the Haparanda Line found its way through to the border against Finland.|$|E
500|$|The 1990s {{began with}} {{progress}} and changes. In 1991, J.D. Adams Hall was remodeled and 9th grade {{was moved to}} the high school. The Buffaloes wrestling team would win state championships in 1990 and the following three years. In 1992, the new cafeteria was completed and the alternative high school was moved to 1401 W. Jones Street. Dr. Milton Pippenger was appointed superintendent in 1993 and a new enclosed walkway was constructed. Another major addition was constructed which would eventually be used as the trophy room. The city population at this time was 24,964. In 1998, the school district unsuccessfully attempted to pass a bond issue calling for a new high school. In terms of athletics, the Buffaloes continued their dominance {{throughout the rest of the}} decade. The wrestling program added two more state championships in 1998 and 1999, while the men's golf team won a state title in 1998 [...] Additionally, the football team <b>finished</b> <b>state</b> runner-up in 1998 and won their first state championship in 1999.|$|E

Regardless, due to the missing story content and subsequent narrative flaws, the game was labelled by some as being unfinished. Conversely, GamesRadar argued that the game's <b>finished</b> <b>state</b> was deliberate on Kojima's part.

2500|$|Cippus is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} a small column, which is at times truncated. Cippi serve as milestones, funerary monuments, markers or votive offerings. [...] The earliest cippi had a cubic shape, and were carved from sandstone. By the late fifth century BC, these became gabled delicate stelae in the Greek fashion. The Maltese marble cippus is about [...] high at the highest point, and is broken at the top. [...] The Louvre Cippus is currently [...] high at its highest point, [...] wide, and [...] thick. [...] "Their form is light and gracefully executed..." [...] with a [...] "...Greek inscription upon the pedestal,a masterpiece of Phoenician epigraphy." [...] The artifacts are carved in white marble, a stone which is not found naturally in the Maltese islands. As {{it is unlikely that}} skilled marble-carvers were available, they were probably imported in their <b>finished</b> <b>state.</b> The inscriptions, however, were probably engraved in Malta on behalf of the two patrons, Abdosir and Osirxamar. Judging by the names on the main inscription, the patrons were of Tyrian extraction. The addition of a synopsis of the dedication in Greek, with the names of the dedicators and of Melqart given in their Hellenised versions, confirms the existence and influence of Hellenistic culture. Additionally, while Malta had been colonised by the Phoenicians since the 8th century BC, by the second century, the Maltese islands were under Roman occupation. The use of Phoenician script also confirms the survival of Phoenician culture and religion on the islands.|$|E
