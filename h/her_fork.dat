60|$|Mrs. Radford, {{large and}} threatening, stood {{suspended}} on the hearthrug, holding <b>her</b> <b>fork.</b>|$|E
60|$|Annette {{looked up}} at him for a moment, looked down, and played with <b>her</b> <b>fork.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mrs Potter {{concluded}} by emphatically stabbing {{a potato}} with <b>her</b> <b>fork,</b> {{and beginning to}} peel it.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly the end came. With {{a shriek}} she sprang in and touched a tall warrior with <b>her</b> <b>forked</b> wand. Instantly {{two of his}} comrades, those {{standing}} immediately next to him, seized the doomed man, each by one arm, and advanced with him towards the king.|$|R
60|$|Louise {{laid down}} <b>her</b> knife and <b>fork.</b> <b>Her</b> left hand {{clutched}} {{the piece of}} toast which was lying by her side. She began to crumble it up into small pieces.|$|R
6000|$|The woman handed <b>her</b> the <b>fork.</b> [...] "This is {{the only}} way," [...] she said, [...] "and you will notice that the tines are very short and blunt." ...|$|R
60|$|Louise dropped <b>her</b> <b>fork</b> with a clatter, disclosing, in this well-bred young lady, {{an unusual}} degree of excitement.|$|E
60|$|He flicked a two-carat diamond {{solitaire}} ring {{across the}} table. Miss Asher flipped {{it back to}} him with <b>her</b> <b>fork.</b>|$|E
60|$|I was {{relieved}} to find her in genial mood. Nothing could have exceeded the cordiality with which she waved <b>her</b> <b>fork.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Palmer," [...] she said, flourishing <b>her</b> {{crimping}} <b>fork</b> tragically, [...] "do {{you mean}} to say you went and invited Linda Grant here tomorrow? Linda Grant, of all women in this world!" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{ordered the}} cocktails at once. Every {{now and then}} he watched her. She ate delicately but with a healthy and unashamed appetite. A little colour came into her cheeks as the room grew warmer, her lower lip became less uncompromising. Suddenly she laid down <b>her</b> knife and <b>fork.</b> <b>Her</b> eyes were agleam with interest. She pulled at his sleeve.|$|R
60|$|She {{put down}} <b>her</b> knife and <b>fork.</b> Tears sprang into her eyes,--tears of anger, he thought.|$|R
60|$|Madame {{put down}} <b>her</b> <b>fork,</b> but kept her knife in her hand. She {{looked across the}} room, not at Miss Pinnegar.|$|E
60|$|At this statement, {{which was}} almost brutal in its brief comprehensiveness, Ida turned pale as death, as well she might, and dropped <b>her</b> <b>fork</b> with a clatter upon the plate.|$|E
6000|$|Lady Olive {{laid down}} <b>her</b> <b>fork.</b> [...] "My dear Harry," [...] she declared, [...] "do {{be a little}} more considerate. How are we to enjoy our luncheon if we think of that poor man?" ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Saxthorpe, who {{had been}} out of the {{conversation}} for far too long, laid down <b>her</b> knife and <b>fork.</b>|$|R
50|$|For collectors, {{the album}} also {{includes}} the rare song Eternal Love, originally released as the b-side of <b>her</b> single A <b>Fork</b> in the Road.|$|R
6000|$|Clarence, who {{had begun}} {{suddenly}} {{to feel that}} {{he was responsible for}} Susy's deportment and was balefully conscious that she was holding <b>her</b> plated <b>fork</b> in <b>her</b> chubby fist by its middle, and, from his previous knowledge of her, was likely at any moment to plunge it into the dish before her, said softly,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Fiorsen {{stretched}} {{out his hand and}} seized hers just where her little warm pulse was beating very steadily. She looked at it, changed <b>her</b> <b>fork</b> over, and went on eating with the other hand. Fiorsen drew his hand away {{as if he had been}} stung.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How,' says Mrs Veneering, {{laying down}} <b>her</b> <b>fork</b> to press her aquiline hands {{together}} at {{the tips of the}} fingers, and addressing the Father who travels the three thousand miles per week: 'how a mother can look at her baby, and know that she lives beyond her husband's means, I cannot imagine.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How easy {{white folks}} al'us does things!" [...] said Aunt Chloe, pausing {{while she was}} {{greasing}} a griddle with a scrap of bacon on <b>her</b> <b>fork,</b> and regarding young Master George with pride. [...] "The way he can write, now! and read, too! and then {{to come out here}} evenings and read his lessons to us,--it's mighty interestin'!" ...|$|E
6000|$|My new {{acquaintance}} smiled again. When {{she smiled}} she was irresistible: a laughing face protruding from {{a cloud of}} diaphanous drapery. [...] "Now, shall I tell you how I came to know that?" [...] she asked, poising a glace cherry on <b>her</b> dessert <b>fork</b> in front of her. [...] "Shall I explain my trick, like the conjurers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Thank God!' I felt it fervently, and I said it fervently. Lady Janet {{laid down}} <b>her</b> knife and <b>fork,</b> and fixed {{one of her}} fierce looks on me.|$|R
6000|$|... "O Frank, {{how can you}} be so wicked?" [...] said Eda, {{taking up}} <b>her</b> knife and <b>fork</b> and attacking the wing with so much energy as almost to justify her friend's assertion.|$|R
6000|$|... "You!" [...] {{said his}} vis-Ã -vis, arching her eyebrows; and others {{up and down}} the table, looked round or over at Hewson where he sat midway of it with Miss Hernshaw {{drooping}} beside him. She alone seemed indifferent to his pretension; she seemed even insensible of it, as she broke off little corners of her ice with <b>her</b> <b>fork.</b>|$|E
60|$|She had {{the true}} Jacobus impudence, that old woman. Her mop of iron-grey hair was parted, {{on the side}} like a man's, raffishly, and she made as if to plunge <b>her</b> <b>fork</b> into it, as she used {{to do with the}} knitting-needle, but refrained. Her little black eyes sparkled venomously. I turned to my host {{at the head of the}} table-- menacingly as it were.|$|E
60|$|I {{was telling}} an amusing story at table {{yesterday}} midday, when my glance chanced to rest upon Miss West. She was not listening. Her food on <b>her</b> <b>fork</b> was {{suspended in the}} air a sheer instant {{as she looked at}} her father with all her eyes. It was a stare of fear. She realized that I was observing, and with superb control, slowly, quite naturally, she lowered the fork and rested it on her plate, retaining her hold on it and retaining her father's face in her look.|$|E
6000|$|Jenny nodded, and, in {{proof of}} her assertion, {{agitated}} <b>her</b> knife and <b>fork,</b> {{like a pair}} of drumsticks, over her plate. [...] "If there's any opportunity of playing the drums..." [...] she began.|$|R
60|$|Ending {{with that}} smart double fire of {{compliments}} to her hosts, the Queen of Hearts honored us all three {{with a smile}} of approval, and transferred her attention to <b>her</b> knife and <b>fork.</b>|$|R
60|$|The settle {{was dark}} and greasy. Alvina feared for her clothes. But she sat with her enamel plate and <b>her</b> {{impossible}} <b>fork,</b> {{a piece of meat}} and a chunk of bread, and ate. It was difficult--but the food was good, and the fire blazed. Only there was a film of wood-smoke in the room, rather smarting. Ciccio sat on the settle beside her, and ate in large mouthfuls.|$|R
60|$|As {{the door}} of the breakfast-room closed upon Pierre, Mrs. Glendinning rose, <b>her</b> <b>fork</b> unconsciously {{retained}} in her hand. Presently, as she paced the room in deep, rapid thought, she became conscious of something strange in her grasp, and without looking at it, to mark what it was, impulsively flung it from her. A dashing noise was heard, and then a quivering. She turned; and hanging by the side of Pierre's portrait, she saw her own smiling picture pierced through, and the fork, whose silver tines had caught in the painted bosom, vibratingly rankled in the wound.|$|E
6000|$|... "A chili," [...] said Rebecca, gasping. [...] "Oh yes!" [...] She {{thought a}} chili was {{something}} cool, {{as its name}} imported, and was served with some. [...] "How fresh and green they look," [...] she said, and put one into her mouth. It was hotter than the curry; flesh and blood could bear it no longer. She laid down <b>her</b> <b>fork.</b> [...] "Water, for Heaven's sake, water!" [...] she cried. Mr. Sedley burst out laughing (he was a coarse man, from the Stock Exchange, where they love all sorts of practical jokes). [...] "They are real Indian, I assure you," [...] said he. [...] "Sambo, give Miss Sharp some water." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jervy, {{watching}} {{her from the}} opposite side of the table, with Phoebe close by him as usual, had his own motives for encouraging her to talk, by the easy means of encouraging her to drink. He sent for another glass of the hot grog. Phoebe, daintily picking up her oysters with <b>her</b> <b>fork,</b> affected to be shocked at Mrs. Sowler's coarse method of eating and drinking. She kept her eyes on her plate, and only consented to taste malt liquor under modest protest. When Jervy lit a cigar, after finishing his supper, she reminded him, in an impressively genteel manner, of the consideration which he owed to the presence of an elderly lady. [...] "I like it myself, dear," [...] she said mincingly; [...] "but perhaps Mrs. Sowler objects to the smell?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah and {{you might}} have added all it seems to ME!" [...] She laughed again, while she took up <b>her</b> knife and <b>fork,</b> as in the cheer of these assurances. [...] "But you're not sure how she'll take it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye mout hev {{left some}} o' that pretty talk for HIM to say," [...] said Minty, taking up <b>her</b> knife and <b>fork</b> {{with a slight}} shrug, [...] "and you needn't call me MISS Minty either, jest because there's kempeny present." ...|$|R
6000|$|But even in {{the midst}} of her Lucullian repast Katy laid down <b>her</b> knife and <b>fork.</b> <b>Her</b> heart sank as lead, and a tear fell upon her filet mignon. Her {{haunting}} suspicions of the star lodger arose again, fourfold. Thus courted and admired and smiled upon by that fashionable and gracious assembly, what else could Mr. Brunelli be but one of those dazzling titled patricians, glorious of name but shy of rent money, concerning whom experience had made her wise? With a sense of his ineligibility growing within her there was mingled a torturing conviction that his personality was becoming more pleasing to her day by day. And why had he left her to dine alone? ...|$|R
