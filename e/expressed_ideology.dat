50|$|A {{political}} {{party is a}} political organization that typically seeks to attain and maintain political power within government, usually by participating in electoral campaigns, educational outreach or protest actions. Parties often espouse an <b>expressed</b> <b>ideology</b> or vision bolstered by a written platform with specific goals, forming a coalition among disparate interests.|$|E

40|$|Since Mallorca was in Nationalist control {{throughout}} the Spanish Civil War, the drama published and {{performed on the}} island provides a fascinating case study of how a distinctive culture was employed to support {{what came to be}} the Francoist cause. This article includes analysis of the plays of Gabriel Cortès, the possibility of dramatic propaganda in Catalan, and the contribution of Francesc Ferrari Billoch. Particular attention is devoted to differing ways of <b>expressing</b> <b>ideology</b> in the theatre and to the press reception plays. The fate of Mallorcan dramatists in early Francoism reveals the contradictions resulting from political allegiances...|$|R
40|$|What {{explains}} {{the gender gap}} in ideology, i. e. the observation that women {{tend to be more}} leftist than men? We provide new evidence showing that personality traits play a key role. Using a novel high-quality data set, we show that the mediating (i. e. indirect) effects of gender operating through personality traits by far dominate the direct effects of gender. They also dominate other potential differences between the sexes like income or education as explanatory factors. Our findings suggest that women tend to be more leftist than men mainly because they have different personalities, which, in turn, shape their <b>expressed</b> <b>ideology.</b> Taking such mediating effects of personality traits into account explains over three quarters of the observed gender gap in general ideological preferences...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{acknowledged}} defects in private pension schemes {{as they are}} presently administered: vesting requirements are long, most plans are not portable, plans are subject to insolvencies, and benefits are inadequate because, among other reasons, they are not indexed for inflation. In this article, Harry Glasbeek argues {{that there is little}} hope that these defects in private pension schemes will be remedied since the primary motivation behind their entrenchment was not to provide retirement income for employees, but was to provide certain benefits for employers such as a more stable work force, the easier retirement of less productive workers, and the accumulation of a large private investment fund. Indeed he argues that, ironically and in spite of their <b>expressed</b> <b>ideology,</b> those who seriously argue that private pensions can be improved invariably end up making suggestions that would have private pension schemes take on the characteristics of a public pension scheme. He concludes by arguing the case for abolishing private pensions and substituting a public non-earnings related scheme...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{concerns}} the criminalization of cross burning. This act of symbolic expression sometimes communicates hate, inspires fear of impending bodily harm, <b>expresses</b> an <b>ideology</b> and solidarity with others, or encompasses combinations of these. In 1991, Edward Cleary defended a White juvenile, known in court documents as R. A. V., who had burned a cross {{on the lawn}} of a Black family. In that litigation, Cleary began his oral argument to the Supreme Court by posing this question: To what degree does abhorrence of cross burning justify banning it? That question still baffles us. Establishing appropriate boundaries {{for the protection of}} speech that can both intimidate and <b>express</b> an <b>ideology</b> constitutes a profound challenge for a progressive society committed to the twin goals of free expression and civil order...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{emplacement}} {{is a way}} {{we might}} better understand how power relations are built into people 2 ̆ 7 s everyday lives, and thus how they may be contested. Though previous research has documented that built form can regulate and <b>express</b> <b>ideology,</b> {{little attention has been}} paid to how buildings are employed and utilized to manage risk. In this paper, I argue that differences in ideas about risk and the built form of two residential women 2 ̆ 7 s clubs in Progressive Era Chicago can be explained by emplaced risk ideologies. Risk ideologies are sets of ideas about danger, and risk emplacement is a practice that links risks to places, and places to risks. The result of risk emplacement is that places become substitutes for the putative danger associated with them...|$|R

40|$|Change in {{government}} has characterized {{the development of}} most nations. Sometimes this change {{has been marked by}} continued evolution, in a peaceful attempt to move forward. Other times, change has been fraught with violent revolution and terrorism. This process {{has been the subject of}} much debate by political scientists and economic philosophers. Today, Turkey suffers from continued threats to its government through violent acts of terrorism conducted by various groups, <b>expressing</b> <b>ideologies</b> of leftist and rightist organizations, as well as ethnic and religious extremists. This thesis examines DHKP/C as the primary leftist revolutionary group effecting Turkey, exploring its historical background in Europe and the Middle East, as well as its philosophical link to Marxism. Further, this treatise discusses the implication of revolution and terrorism expressed by DHKP/C; and explores innovative and peaceful solutions, strategies, and techniques to be used by the police forces of Turkey in combating this grou...|$|R

50|$|The alt-right has {{its roots}} on Internet {{websites}} such as 4chan and 8chan, where anonymous members create and use Internet memes to <b>express</b> their <b>ideologies.</b> It is difficult to tell how much of what people write in these venues is serious {{and how much is}} intended to provoke outrage. Members of the alt-right use websites like Alternative Right, Twitter, Breitbart, and Reddit to convey their message.

40|$|Discourses {{are more}} than just {{patterns}} of words. For discourse communities, they <b>express</b> <b>ideologies</b> and provide meanings that can be translated into action. They are vehicles for reform when they thrive. The discourse of person-centered medicine has had a vigorous start, with identifiable leaders, a vocabulary which has situated meanings, institutions such as meetings, letterheads and a Society and a group of adherents that constitute a discourse community. For a discourse to thrive, its founding problematic has to be perceived as 'real' by its target audience — in this case, presumably, healthcare workers. Real in this sense can be defined as something perceived to have an influence on foundational values, for better or for worse. It is not yet clear that the discourse of person-centered medicine has convinced its target audience of the 'crisis of knowledge, care, compassion and costs' that it invokes to justify its proposed paradigm shift. In order to make it thrive, those who drive the discourse will need to 'realise' both the crisis it addresses and the outcomes it may achieve.

5|$|The Roman Empire {{was one of}} {{the largest}} in history, with {{contiguous}} territories throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.

40|$|ABSTRACT How {{the news}} expresses exclusion: A {{linguistic}} analysis of two Montreal newspapers and their {{coverage of the}} Occupy movement James Gibbons This study examines exclusion as an expressive act occurring in language. Using a sample of news coverage taken from The Gazette and La Presse, this thesis examines grammatical and lexical elements that express exclusion. The purpose {{is to examine the}} characteristics of language that posit a “they” identification, as opposed to an “us” identification. Elements that express a “not like us” differentiation will be considered along with supplementary context, such as social theories of exclusion. The methodology adopted for this study is based on critical linguistic studies and functional grammar; this method considers language to <b>express</b> <b>ideology,</b> whether deliberate or inadvertent. The methodology examines power structures in the sentence such as “transitivity,” which is the analysis of who does what to whom, and lexical (word and terminological) choices that, in certain instances, express negative associative values (connotations). These transitive and lexical considerations, taken cumulatively across a text, provide a conception of the principal idea used to organize the text, or what some of the prevailing ideas happen to be. The sample used consists of news coverage of the Occupy movement, as featured during the time frame spanning the 15 th of October to the 25 th of November 2011...|$|R
