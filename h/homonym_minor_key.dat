40|$|Abstract — Basing upon {{original}} computational analytic method (Majchrzak 2005, 2007), {{the present}} work aims, at: 1) Showing the differences {{for the major}} <b>key</b> and the <b>minor</b> (harmonic) <b>key</b> in the classification of chords, as an aspect of importance for interpreting a piece’s tonal structure diagram; 2) Drawing attention to the subordination of the <b>minor</b> <b>key</b> as versus the major key in the chord classification, using the same algorithm. The relations between chords appearing in the major and <b>minor</b> (harmonic) <b>key</b> are shown by applying the comparisons of: 1) third-based chords; 2) degrees in the C major and A <b>minor</b> <b>keys,</b> on which the same diatonic chords appear...|$|R
