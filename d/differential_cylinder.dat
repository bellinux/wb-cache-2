In this paper I investigate the response of Jupiter’s shape to <b>differential</b> rotation on <b>cylinders</b> of various cylindrical radii using a simple equipotential theory. I find that both solid-body rotation (with System III rotation rate) and <b>differential</b> rotation on <b>cylinders</b> up to a latitude between 20 and 30 degrees are consistent with Jupiter’s measured shape.

The new type of piston pump can output the flows with two different values to control {{the movement of the}} <b>differential</b> <b>cylinder</b> directly in the closed circuit and realize much ideal result of the control of the <b>differential</b> <b>cylinder</b> by a single pump. Also a simulation model of the hydraulic pump is established under the circumstance of SimulationX software, considering the characteristics of the movement of an individual piston, the oil compressibility, and the flow distribution area changed with the rotation angle. The key data of the pump is defined by means of digital simulation. In particular, an analysis is made on the dimension of the unloading groove of the port plate and the characteristics of the flow pulse of the pump. Furthermore, an experimental model pump is manufactured, the basic performances of the pump is tested on the experimental platform at various rotatory speeds such as pressure, flow and noise, in the end the accuracy of the principle is verified...|$|E

Here, an elastic robot arm driven by a <b>differential</b> <b>cylinder</b> is investigated. The task is to design a suitable control law which not only tracks a given trajectory but also allows the damping of the flexible arm. In general, the flatness-property of a dynamical system enables a 2 ̆ 2 simple 2 ̆ 2 approach to solve a given tracking control problem. Although {{the model of the}} <b>differential</b> <b>cylinder</b> is not flat, the tracking control in terms of flatness is possible if some of the state variables are measured. Furthermore, the control law is supplemented with a damping component, based on model matching. This approach to control is confirmed to be suitable through simulation results...|$|E

40|$|The {{numerical}} solution of partial differential equations in unbounded domains requires a finite computational domain. Often one obtains a finite domain by introducing an artificial boundary and imposing boundary conditions there. This paper derives exact boundary conditions at an artificial boundary for partial <b>differential</b> equations in <b>cylinders.</b> An abstract theory is developed {{to analyze the}} general linear problem. Solvability requirements and estimates of {{the solution of the}} resulting finite problem are obtained by use of the notions of exponential and ordinary dichotomies. Useful representations of the boundary conditions are derived using separation of variables for problems with constant tails. The constant tail results are extended to problems whose coefficients obtain limits at infinity by use of an abstract perturbation theory. The perturbation theory approach is also applied to a class of nonlinear problems. General asymptotic formulas for the boundary conditions are derived and displayed in detail...|$|R

The pistons are connected in opposition to share the work. As the channels are open and closed by movement of pistons the working fluid passing through the adequate channel is heated, cooled or let adiabaticaly flown from one cylinder to the other. The arrangement enables different thermodynamic cycles to be performed. Here the Brayton cycle is chosen by adequate choice of volume ratio and by positioning the channel apertures. During isobaric parts of the cycle the gas is adequately heated or cooled when passing through corresponding channel. During these process temperatures remain constant (and different) in each cylinder. The performance of the engine is analyzed and the parameters and efficiency determined...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} resistance-free motion control refers to {{solutions}} that minimize or completely {{eliminate the need}} for proportional valves, hence avoiding the throttling losses associated with metering. Previous research by the authors shows how a secondary control system could be used to improve energy efficiency in construction machines. The proposed solution uses hydraulic transformers, powered by a common pressure rail system driving both the linear work implements and the rotary drives of a propulsion system in a wheel loader. An emphasis in this paper is on the sizing aspects of transformer-based system design. The solution under special observation enables the use of smaller transformers utilizing the <b>differential</b> <b>cylinder</b> as a two-stage gearbox by means of “short-circuiting” its two cylinder chambers.

40|$|Electrohydraulic and {{electromechanical}} {{valve train}} technologies for four-stroke engines are emerging which allow much greater flexibility {{and control of}} the valve events than can be achieved using mechanically-based systems. Much of the work done on exploiting the benefits of these systems has been directed towards improving engine fuel economy and reducing emissions. In the present work a study has been made, using an engine simulation program, in to some of the possible benefits to engine performance that may be facilitated by the flexibility of fully variable valve train (FVVT) systems. The simulation study indicates that FVVT systems, limited by realistic opening and closing rates, provide sufficient range in the valve event duration and timing to enable the engine to produce very high specific outputs whilst achieving a high level of torque in the low- and mid-speed range. It is also shown that an FVVT system makes it possible to modify the basic intake manifold tuning mechanism by modifying the engine firing order, without recourse to variable geometry manifold systems. Additionally, the operation of a 'pneumatic hybridisation' concept are investigated and a range of further operating strategies, including <b>Differential</b> <b>Cylinder</b> Loading, which become viable upon the adoption of FVVT systems are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{arbitrary}} {{position control}} of cylinder {{has always been}} the hard challenge in pneumatic system.

And the mathematical models of the cylinder driving system are linearized. Then fuzzy PID control algorithm is designed for the cylinder position control, including the detail analysis of fuzzy variables and domain, fuzzy logic rules, and defuzzification. The stability of the proposed fuzzy PID controller is theoretically proved according to the small gain theorem. Experiments for targets position of 250 [*]mm, 300 [*]mm, and 350 [*]mm were done and the results showed that the absolute error of the position control is less than 0. 25 [*]mm.

40|$|Hydraulic <b>differential,</b> {{electric}} servo <b>cylinders</b> {{are strongly}} non-linear, coupled multivariable electromechanical tools applicable for driving e. g. manipulators. Besides saturation-type nonlinearities discontinous ones originating from the {{friction between the}} cylinder and the piston and the hydrodynamic properties {{of the flow of}} the working fluid are present in such systems. Though they have considerable advantages in comparison with electric ones in several applications their traditional PID control have to cope with the problem of instabilities and dificulties in finding the proper setting of their feedback gains. These parameters significantly depend on the actual pose of the robot arm and the temperature of the hydraulic oil varying during operation. To widen their applicability both disturbance rejection based, and partial flatness principle based approaches requiring the accurate model of the system and measurement of the disturbances and their time-derivatives were proposed. For getting rid of needing this accurate set of information an adaptive approach working with a hectic learning phase and an acceptable regime of “tuned ” operation was also proposed. In the present paper twoo possible non-linear improvement of this already non-linear control is presented and comaperd to each other. Generally the “learning ” phase is shortened and it becomes less hectic, and trajectory tracking becomes more accurate. The capabilities of the improved control are illustrated via simulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} {{research}} is the horizontally balanced loading platform on soft suspension. Deviation from the horizontal direction of the platform can be caused by: - Displacement of the gravity centre of main unit load placed on it from the vertical axis of the platform; - Displacement of the mass centre of the load dispersed on the platform plane from its vertical axis; - Adding a load which gravity centre does not coincide with the gravity centre of the main load. In specific cases the use of complex and expensive tracking systems of high accuracy to balance loading platforms horizontally can be justified, e. g. when mounting the optical measuring or observation systems on a platform. The aim is to assess the possibility to use the soft hydro-pneumatic suspension with a low power supply unit to provide horizontal balance of platform. The paper offers a soft hydro-pneumatic suspension design of the rectangular loading platform based on four <b>differential</b> hydraulic <b>cylinders</b> to be the supports for two diagonal beams of the platform. The head and rod ends of each pair of the beam hydro-cylinders are cross-pipe connected, and to compensate for {{a difference between the}} volumes of head and rod ends of cylinders because of their differentiality, there are hydraulic bag-type accumulators installed in the hydraulic suspension system. The research technique involves the development of a mathematical model of the loading platform hydro-pneumatic suspension followed by its approbation using numerical methods. The paper presents algorithms of engineering analysis of parameters and structural dimensions of hydraulic suspension components. In order to assess the adequacy of the developed mathematical model of a hydro-pneumatic suspension the paper studiesthe an effect of the following factors {{on the quality of the}} platform stabilization in the horizon:  initial volume values of the gas chamber of hydraulic accumulators;  pressure level of initial pressurization of hydraulic accumulators with nitrogen;  differentiality degree of the suspension cylinders;  value of the gravity centre displacement with respect to the vertical axis of platform;  additional loading of the platform by the load undisplaced with respect to the vertical axis of platform. In the context of calculating a hydro-pneumatic suspension of the platform loading diagonal beam of 2 m length, weighing 500 kg, with a load of 5, 000 kg was shown that at the greatest displacement of the load gravity centre to the edge of the beam a deviation of the beam relative to the horizon is one angular degree, at most. The work deals with creating the soft stabilized platform suspensions for stationary systems and mobile units. As a result, a developed mathematical model allows the following: - to show the theoretical possibility to create a soft hydro-pneumatic suspension of the loading platform based on four differential hydro-cylinders and four hydraulic accumulators to provide an acceptable accuracy of the loading platform balance in the horizon when the mass centre of the load placed on it is displaced with respect to the vertical axis of the platform; - to find that the initial stiffness of the hydro-pneumatic suspension, defined by parameters of its hydraulic system, has little effect on the quality of the platform balance in the horizon. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{variable}} displacement pump control system has greater energy-saving advantages and application prospects than the valve control system. However, the {{variable displacement}} pump control of <b>differential</b> <b>cylinder</b> is not concurrent with the existing technologies. The asymmetric pump-controlled cylinder is, therefore, used to balance the unequal volume flow through a single rod cylinder in closed-circuit system. This {{is considered to be}} an effective method. Nevertheless, the asymmetric axial piston pump (AAPP) is a constant displacement pump. In this study, variable-displacement asymmetric axial piston pump (VAPP) is investigated according to the same principle used in investigating AAPP. This study, therefore, aims at investigating the characteristics of VAPP. The variable-displacement output of VAPP is implemented by controlling the swash plate angle with angle feedback control circuit, which is composed of a servo proportional valve and an angular displacement sensor. The angular displacement sensor is connected to the swash plate. The simulation model of VAPP, which is set up through the ITI-SimulationX simulation platform, is used to predict VAPP’s characteristics. The purpose of implementing the experiment is to verify the theoretical results. Both the simulation and the experiment results demonstrated that the swash plate angle is controlled by a variable mechanism; when the swash plate angle increases, the flow of Port B and Port T increases while the response speed of Port B and Port T also accelerates. When the swash plate angle is constant, the flow of Port B and Port T increases along with the increase of pump speed, although the pressure-response speed of Port B is faster than that of Port T. Consequently, the flow pulsation of Port B and Port T tends to decrease gradually along with the increase of pump speed. When the pressure loaded on Port B equals to that of Port T, the flow ripple cycle of Port B is longer than that of Port T, whereas the peak flow of Port B is higher than that of Port T. Since the flow ripple of Port T is bigger than that of Port B, Port T should be connected to the low pressure sides or the oil tank so that it does not affect VAPP’s performance. Further, to avoid the backflow of VAPP from Port T to Port B, Port T cannot be loaded alone, and the loading pressure of Port T also cannot exceed that of Port B...|$|E

Who transported at that time their {{material}} yet with donkeys [...] It was suggested General Garbari as project officer and formulated a number of requirements which the vehicle had to meet: it needed to move a load of 500 kg through all kinds of terrain, especially in mountainous areas and on very narrow paths. The development was first placed in the hands of Antonio Micucci and later worked on by Soldavini and Giulio Cesare Carcano [...] Carcano had just a new long mounted V-twin engine with forced air cooling developed, where the directors of Moto Guzzi bread saw. There was a 500 and a 650 cc version that was intended for the Fiat 500, but Fiat withdrew from the project. Carcano saw his chance to still find a use for his new engine. The [...] "Mulo Meccanico" [...] (Mechanical Donkey) was a very special machine with wheel drive and variable wheelbase and track width [...] The 754 cc engine produced just 20 hp, due to the low compression ratio that, taking into account fuel of low quality, was necessary. The couple, however, of 47 Nm was achieved at 2,400 rpm. There was only one 26mm Weber carburettor used and the machine had a waterproof coil - ignition [...] There was a chassis system which consisted of tubes and pressed steel box sections. The rear suspension consisted of two box girder arms that were cushioned by rubber suspension. At the front was a one-sided telescopic fork with coil springs [...] The control was done with a steering wheel through bevel gears. The driver sat on a motorcycle seat, but the operation was done through levers and pedals as in a car [...] The engine was sitting behind the driver. Behind it was a manual gearbox with six forward gears and one reverse. There was a central differential with a teruglooppal to prevent roll back. 20% of the drive went to the front wheel, 80% to the rear wheels. The rear-wheel drive was done with two drive shafts that went diagonally from the differential to the two wheels, the front-wheel drive through a propeller shaft leading from the <b>differential</b> between the <b>cylinders</b> through to the steering head went. Using three bevel gears, the drive was at the steering led to another drive shaft, which powered the front wheel. In one cabinet aluminum were located both the gearbox, the differential and the device to adjust the track width. That could happen driving: a distance of about 25 with the gauge could be changed from 1300 mm to 850 mm or vice versa, but in an emergency that could still happen. The drum brakes were behind hydraulic operated, the drum brake at the front {{with the aid of a}} Bowden cable [...] Behind the rear wheels were tensioning rollers, leaving a short caterpillar could be mounted. The front fender left enough space for a snow chain [...] However Autoveicolo da Montagna did not meet expectations. As long as there was straight drove the machine could take the most improbable slopes, but sideways was always the danger of falling over, because there were only three wheels. On the mountain trails were very short turns or rocks enough to stop the mechanical donkey while a real donkey did not experience any problems here. Therefore, the Autoveicolo da Montagna was already taken out of production in 1963.|$|R
