40|$|The European Currency Unit (ECU) {{was officially}} {{introduced}} in March 1979 and {{has joined the}} ranks of innovative financial products that are rapidly appearing. The purpose of the paper is to explore the properties of the ECU and analyze those characteristics of the ECU, and products <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> <b>ECU,</b> that offer value-added. Changes in communications and information technology, changes in the regulatory climate, and changes in the macroeconomic environment have generally encouraged recent financial innovations. We argue that the ECU has gained an edge on its component currencies because of its portfolio properties, its role in reducing transaction costs, the role of the European Monetary System, and trading factors peculiar to the ECU. Private participants should continue to gravitate toward the ECU as a useful vehicle to fulfill the services of money. ...|$|E
5000|$|The European Currency Unit (₠ or ECU, [...] ) was {{a basket}} of the {{currencies}} of the European Community member states, used as the unit of account of the European Community before being replaced by the euro on 1 January 1999, at parity. The ECU itself replaced the European Unit of Account, also at parity, on 13 March 1979. The European Exchange Rate Mechanism attempted to minimize fluctuations between member state currencies and the ECU. The ECU was also used in some international financial transactions, where its advantage was that securities <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> <b>ECUs</b> provided investors with the opportunity for foreign diversification without reliance on the currency of a single country.|$|R

From 1882, the dirham became a subdivision of the Moroccan rial, with 50 Mazunas = 10 dirham = 1 rial.|$|R

The peso notes were <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> [...] "peso fuerte". Notes <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> reales were issued until 1871. In 1874, notes for 10, 20 and 50 centavos were issued, with 20 pesos notes introduced in 1875.|$|R
5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies <b>in</b> the system, <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> terms of <b>ECUs.</b> The weights within the <b>ECU</b> changed <b>in</b> response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|R

50|$|There is no {{consensus}} on the scope of naming convention for different types of IRS. Even a wide description of IRS contracts only includes those whose legs are <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> the same currency. It is generally accepted that swaps of similar nature whose legs are <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> different currencies are called cross currency basis swaps. Swaps which are determined on a floating rate index in one currency but whose payments are <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> another currency are called quantos.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{difference}} between external debt <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> domestic currency, and external debt <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> foreign currency. A nation can service external debt <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> domestic currency by tax revenues, but to service foreign currency debt it has to convert tax revenues in foreign exchange market to foreign currency, which puts downward pressure on the value of its currency. So all of the money used to service foreign currency debt has to come from a country's balance of payments transfers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{balance of}} payments identity {{does not take into}} account changes in asset prices and exchange rates. For example, the value of external assets or liabilities can change due to higher or lower stockmarket prices or a default/write-off on debt. Similarly, changes in exchange rates will affect the value of foreign assets and liabilities. An appreciation of a country's currency will decrease both the value of assets <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> foreign currency and the burden of liabilities <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> foreign currency. The value of assets and liabilities <b>denominated</b> <b>in</b> the home currency will not be affected by changes in the exchange rate.|$|R
