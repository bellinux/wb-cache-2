Simultaneously, fishermen in Playa Azul protested that their livelihood was endangered due to fishing bans caused by the chemical spill; consequently, in Lázaro Cárdenas, 28people were arrested while warrants for 526 others' arrest were issued for disturbing peace and blocking highways. This sparked protests from two <b>environmental</b> <b>group</b> as a well a group of Mexican artists. Also, the fisherman demanded a $1million compensation.

Building on the methodologies of Kempton et al. (2001), we first show that official lists of nonprofit groups–from the Vermont Secretary of State, the Internal Revenue Service, and local grassroots directories–significantly undercount local <b>environmental</b> <b>groups.</b> Second, we show that since the mid- 1980 s, the number and membership roles of local autonomous <b>environmental</b> <b>groups</b> have grown rapidly relative to all other types of local and non-local land-based groups in these counties.

40|$|The {{debate about}} genetic {{modification}} (GM) {{can be seen}} as characteristic of our time. <b>Environmental</b> <b>groups,</b> in challenging GM, are also challenging modernist faith in progress, and science and technology. In this paper we use the case of New Zealand's Royal Commission on Genetic Modification to explore the application of science discourses as used by <b>environmental</b> <b>groups.</b> We do this by situating the debate in the framework of modernity, discussing the use of science by <b>environmental</b> <b>groups,</b> and deconstructing the science discourses evident within environmental groups' submissions to the Commission. We find science being called into question by the very movement that has relied on it to fight environmental issues for many years. The <b>environmental</b> <b>groups</b> are challenging the traditional boundaries of science, for although they use science they also present it as a culturally embedded activity with no greater epistemological authority than other knowledge systems. Their discourses, like that of the other main actors in the GM debate, are thus part of the constant re-negotiation of the cultural construct of 'science'.

A.R.R.F. has raised money and bid alongside polluters since 1995 for as many allowances as their funds can buy.
