25|$|However, {{there are}} {{possible}} drawbacks of SIR technology, such as leaching of the extractant or clogging of a <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> by attrition of the particles. These might be remedied by choosing the proper particle-extractant-system. This implies selecting a suitable extractant with low water solubility, which is sufficiently retained inside the pores, and selecting mechanically stable particles as a solid {{support for the}} extractant. Additionally, SIRs can be stabilized by coating them, as shown by D. Muraviev et al. As coating material, A. W. Trochimczuk et al. used polyvinyl alcohol.|$|E

2500|$|Flow {{hydrogenation}} {{has become}} a popular technique at the bench and increasingly the process scale. This technique involves continuously flowing a dilute stream of dissolved reactant over a <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> catalyst {{in the presence of}} hydrogen. Using established HPLC technology, this technique allows the application of pressures from atmospheric to [...] Elevated temperatures may also be used. At the bench scale, systems use a range of pre-packed catalysts which eliminates the need for weighing and filtering pyrophoric catalysts.|$|E
2500|$|The fuel is {{fluidized}} in {{oxygen and}} steam or air. The ash is removed dry or as heavy agglomerates that defluidize. The temperatures are relatively low in dry ash gasifiers, so the fuel must be highly reactive; low-grade coals are particularly suitable. The agglomerating gasifiers have slightly higher temperatures, and {{are suitable for}} higher rank coals. Fuel throughput is higher than for the <b>fixed</b> <b>bed,</b> but {{not as high as}} for the entrained flow gasifier. The conversion efficiency can be rather low due to elutriation of carbonaceous material. [...] Recycle or subsequent combustion of solids can be used to increase conversion. Fluidized bed gasifiers are most useful for fuels that form highly corrosive ash that would damage the walls of slagging gasifiers. Biomass fuels generally contain high levels of corrosive ash.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>fixed</b> <b>bed</b> of {{carbonaceous}} fuel (e.g. coal or biomass) {{through which the}} [...] "gasification agent" [...] (steam, oxygen and/or air) flows in counter-current configuration. The ash is either removed in the dry condition or as a slag. The slagging gasifiers have a lower ratio of steam to carbon, achieving temperatures higher than the ash fusion temperature. The nature of the gasifier means that the fuel must have high mechanical strength and must ideally be non-caking {{so that it will}} form a permeable bed, although recent developments have reduced these restrictions to some extent. The throughput for this type of gasifier is relatively low. Thermal efficiency is high as the temperatures in the gas exit are relatively low. However, this means that tar and methane production is significant at typical operation temperatures, so product gas must be extensively cleaned before use. The tar can be recycled to the reactor.|$|E

30|$|<b>Fixed</b> {{fluidized}} <b>bed</b> reactor {{is a kind}} of {{fluidized bed}} that has no external circulating particles.

Therefore, the <b>fixed</b> fluidized <b>bed</b> reactor is widely used in laboratory studies for operating parameter optimization and catalyst evaluation [2, 3], as well as developing kinetic models [4, 5], especially for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process.

To understand the hydrodynamics, reaction kinetics and thermodynamics in conventional and modified <b>fixed</b> fluidized <b>bed</b> reactors, the computational fluid dynamics method, energy-minimization multi-scale-based two-fluid model coupled with a six-lump kinetic model was used to investigate the gas–solid flow and cracking reactions. The gas mixing and particle volume fraction distributions, as well as product yields in the conventional and modified <b>fixed</b> fluidized <b>bed</b> reactors were analyzed. The residence time distribution model was utilized to obtain the parameters indicating the back-mixing degree, such as mean residence time and dimensionless variance of the gas. The results showed that the simulated product distribution is in reasonable agreement with the experimental data; the modified <b>fixed</b> fluidized <b>bed</b> reactor is closer to the ideal plug flow reactor, which can efficiently enhance the gas–solid mixing, reduce the gas back-mixing degree, and hence improve the reaction performance.|$|R

The conversion of H/sub 2 / to H/sub 2 /O by reduction of CuO in <b>fixed</b> <b>beds</b> increased with in- creasing bed length, temperature, hydrogen/argon ratio, and decreasing mesh size of CuO. Residence times required for 99 % conversion in a 1 - in. -diam. bed were 0. 6 and 1. 2 sec for 30 % hydrogen- 70 % argon and 10 % hydrogen 90 % argon mixtures, respectively, at a total gas flow of 1 l/min. The CuO used was 25 -mil-diam. wires with a surface area of 0. 019 m/sup 2 //g. The residence time required for a given value of conversion decreased about 10 % when the total flow rate was increased from 1 to 1. 7 liters/min, which indicates that the reduction is mass-transfer controlled to a slight extent under the experimental conditions used.
