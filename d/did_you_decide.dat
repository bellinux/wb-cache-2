30|$|In the semi-structured interview, {{teachers}} discussed {{various aspects}} of their models, what strengths they brought to their models, and the challenges and benefits associated with their models. However, if there were certain areas that were not addressed spontaneously by the participants, there were opportunities within the interview protocol to address them. For example, for the question, “How and why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> to pursue your current teaching model?”, teachers were further prompted with questions related to the roles of administration; teachers; research, anecdotal evidence, or past experience; and standards (e.g., Common Core State Standards, Next Generation Science Standards). If teachers failed to address particular stakeholders when asked about challenges or benefits, they would be prompted to do so (i.e., themselves or other teachers, administration, students, parents). Finally, the semi-structured interview format allowed the interviewer to follow up during the conversation with additional questions for clarification or further exploration.|$|E
30|$|The basic {{question}} above begs some immediate follow-up questions, ones that draw on influential factors shared by both metacognitive and EL processes. For example, if participants do switch between perspectives, what contexts or motivations trigger switching (e.g. environment complexity, learning goals, metacognitive monitoring, {{individual differences in}} spatial skills)? To address context, virtual environments could vary landmark similarity, intersection complexity, or field of view range. Different learning goals could change motivations for interacting with an environment. Additionally, think-aloud protocols or direct questions, such as “Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> to switch to the other display?” could explore metacognitive and motivational factors impacting perspective switching. In addition, using individual difference measures, such as the Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale (Hegarty et al., 2002) or the Scale on Sense of Direction and Spatial Representation (Pazzaglia, Cornoldi, & De Beni, 2000) and tying these to contextual factors and metacognitive monitoring should provide insights into how these factors interact. These factors may individually or jointly affect patterns of perspective switching and the different patterns could, in turn, affect EL. Results from studies such as these can provide useful guidance for navigational aid design.|$|E

40|$|Last weekend China Beat contributors—and {{longtime}} Beijing neighbors—Susan Jakes and Leslie T. Chang {{caught up}} to talk about Chang’s newly released book,Factory Girls: From Village to City in a Changing China. The book, which builds on stories Chang wrote as {{a correspondent for the}} Wall Street Journal (and currently garnering glowing reviews and widespread coverage), follows the lives of young rural women making new lives for themselves in the southern Chinese city of Dongguan. Susan Jakes: How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> you wanted {{to write a book about}} migrant workers in China? What did you want to try to figure out? Was there a weakness in the existing reporting on this subject that you wanted to address? Leslie Chang: The book project began with a bit of an agenda. I had already read some stories in the foreign press, including the Wall Street Journal, about how terrible the conditions in the factories were. The stories tended to focus on the worst cases, the abuses, the miseries, the horrible bosses, the injuries. They tended to portray migration as a desperate act without much of a pay-off for people. I had a suspicion that there must be more to this, that perhaps things were not so black and white. I also thought that, for a young person coming from a farming village this whole experience in the city might appear very different than it does to us as Western observers. What is it like to leave your village at 16 or 17, to come to a city where you don’t know a single person or only one person, to work in a factory, to earn money for the first time? How does your relationship with your family change? How do your friendships change? How does your worldview change? I thought there must be more to the story. And with that suspicion in mind, I went down to Dongguan in February of 2004...|$|E
40|$|Hydrology I {{is taught}} every {{semester}} at Utah Valley University {{and is a}} required course for majors in both Environmental Management and Geology. Prior to Fall 2010, the mean passing rate in the course was 29 % (SD = 4 %) with a mean enrollment of N = 19 (SD = 6). In all cases, {{students who did not}} pass either formally withdrew or simply stopped coming to class and completing assignments. In Fall 2010, when the enrollment peaked at N = 28, the course was reorganized with the intention of reducing the attrition rate. The root cause of attrition was identified as the fear and frustration that students experienced while attempting to solve problem sets on their own. In-class lectures and out-of-class problem sets were replaced with out-ofclass reading assignments and in-class group problem-solving with coaching by the instructor. Some of the in-class problems were calculations with one correct answer, while others were essentially role-playing scenarios in which multiple approaches were possible and expected. The Fall 2010 class earned a record passing rate of 71 %, followed by passing rates of 89 % and 86 % in Spring 2011 and Fall 2011, respectively. At the end of each course, students were surveyed with the question: “Did you ever consider dropping this course? If so, why did you consider dropping the course and why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> not to drop the course?” The vast majority of respondents (93 %) have stated that they never considered dropping the course and the most frequent (25 %) explanation has been some version of “The course was interesting” followed by versions of “I need the course for my career plans” (12. 5 %), “The course is required for the degree” (12. 5 %), and “I enjoy a challenge / I am not a quitter” (12. 5 %). A sample explanation has been “No, I find the subject very interesting. The class was involving and it used applications in real world settings. I learned a lot about hydrology and ways to benefit the less fortunate. ” The tentative conclusion is that students will focus on the interesting aspects of a subject if their frustration level can be effectively managed. Another consequence of the course reorganization is that, beginning in Spring 2011, the mean enrollment has dropped to N = 10 (SD = 2) as students are no longer enrolling in the course repeatedly until they pass...|$|E
