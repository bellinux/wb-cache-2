25|$|The {{first signs}} of an {{arrangement}} of cells in the tooth bud occur in the cap stage. A small group of ectomesenchymal cells stops producing extracellular substances, which results in an aggregation of these cells called the <b>dental</b> <b>papilla.</b> At this point, the tooth bud grows around the ectomesenchymal aggregation, taking on {{the appearance of a}} cap, and becomes the enamel (or dental) organ covering the <b>dental</b> <b>papilla.</b> A condensation of ectomesenchymal cells called the dental sac or follicle surrounds the enamel organ and limits the <b>dental</b> <b>papilla.</b> Eventually, the enamel organ will produce enamel, the <b>dental</b> <b>papilla</b> will produce dentin and pulp, and the dental sac will produce all the supporting structures of a tooth, the periodontium.|$|E

40|$|Important factors {{involved}} in odontogenesis in mouse <b>dental</b> <b>papillae</b> disappear between the pre-and post-natal stages of development. Therefore, {{we hypothesized that}} certain genes involved in odontogenesis in <b>dental</b> <b>papillae</b> were subject to pre-/post-natal down-regulation. Our goal was to identify, by microarray analysis, which genes were down-regulated. <b>Dental</b> <b>papillae</b> were isolated from embryonic 16 -day-, 18 -day- (E 16, E 18), and post-natal 3 -day-old (P 3) murine first mandibular molar germs and analyzed by microarray. The number of down-regulated genes was 2269 between E 16 and E 18, and 3130 between E 18 and P 3. Drastic down-regulation (fold change > 10. 0) of Adamts 4, Aldha 1 a 2, and Lef 1 was observed at both E 16 and E 18, and quantitative RT-PCR revealed a post-natal reduction in their expression (Adamts 4, 1 / 3; Aldh 1 a 2, 1 / 13; and Lef 1, 1 / 37).

40|$|Timing {{and pattern}} of {{expression}} of alkaline phosphatase was examined during early differentiation of the 1 st arch skeleton in inbred C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Embryos were recovered between 10 and 18 d of gestation and staged using a detailed staging table of craniofacial development prior to histochemical examination. Expression of alkaline phosphatase is initiated at stage 20. 2 in the plasma membrane of mesenchymal {{cells in the}} distal region of the first arch. Expression is strongest in osteoid (unmineralised bone matrix) and presumptive periosteum at stage 21. 32. Mineralisation begins at stage E 23. Expression {{is present in the}} mineralised bone matrix. Secondary cartilages form in the condylar and angular processes by stage M 24. The cartilaginous cells and surrounding cells in the processes are all alkaline phosphatase-positive and surrounded by the common periosteum, suggesting that progenitor cells of the processes, dentary ramus and secondary cartilages all originate from a common pool. Nonhypertrophied chondrocytes of Meckel's cartilage express alkaline phosphatase at stage M 23. Expression in these chondrocytes is preceded by the expression in their adjacent perichondrium. This is true of chondrocytes in all other cranial cartilages examined. 3 -D reconstruction of expression in Meckel's cartilage also revealed that the chondrocytes of Meckel's cartilage which express alkaline phosphatase and the matrix of which undergoes mineralisation are those surrounded by the alkaline phosphatase-positive dentary ramus. By stage 25, coincident with mineralisation in the distal section of Meckel's cartilage, most chondrocytes are strongly positive. The perichondria of malleus and incus cartilages express alkaline phosphatase at stage M 24. Nonhypertrophied chondrocytes along these perichondria also express alkaline phosphatase. Superficial and deep cells in the dental laminae of incisor and 1 st molar teeth become alkaline phosphatase-positive at the bud stage, stages 21. 16 and 21. 32, respectively. <b>Dental</b> <b>papillae</b> are negative until stage M 24 when alkaline phosphatase expression begins in the <b>dental</b> <b>papillae</b> and follicles of the incisor teeth and the dental follicles of the 1 st molar teeth.

25|$|Whereas mantle dentin forms {{from the}} preexisting ground {{substance}} of the <b>dental</b> <b>papilla,</b> primary dentin forms through a different process. Odontoblasts increase in size, eliminating the availability of any extracellular resources to contribute to an organic matrix for mineralization. Additionally, the larger odontoblasts cause collagen to be secreted in smaller amounts, which results in more tightly arranged, heterogeneous nucleation that is used for mineralization. Other materials (such as lipids, phosphoproteins, and phospholipids) are also secreted.|$|E
25|$|Odontoblasts, the dentin-forming cells, {{differentiate}} from {{cells of the}} <b>dental</b> <b>papilla.</b> They begin secreting an organic matrix around the area directly adjacent to the inner enamel epithelium, closest {{to the area of}} the future cusp of a tooth. The organic matrix contains collagen fibers with large diameters (0.1–0.2μm in diameter). The odontoblasts begin to move {{toward the center of the}} tooth, forming an extension called the odontoblast process. Thus, dentin formation proceeds toward the inside of the tooth. The odontoblast process causes the secretion of hydroxyapatite crystals and mineralization of the matrix. This area of mineralization is known as mantle dentin and is a layer usually about 150μm thick.|$|E
25|$|Hard tissues, {{including}} enamel and dentin, develop {{during the}} next stage of tooth development. This stage is called the crown, or maturation stage, by some researchers. Important cellular changes occur at this time. In prior stages, all of the IEE cells were dividing to increase the overall size of the tooth bud, but rapid dividing, called mitosis, stops during the crown stage at the location where the cusps of the teeth form. The first mineralized hard tissues form at this location. At the same time, the IEE cells change in shape from cuboidal to columnar and become preameloblasts. The nuclei of these cells move closer to the stratum intermedium and away from the <b>dental</b> <b>papilla</b> as they become polarized.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} growth hormone, its {{mediator}} insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and {{fetal calf serum}} on odontogenesis were compared to those of serum-free medium. Explanted, 16 -day, fetal mouse first molar tooth germs in early bell stage were grown on semisolid, serum-free medium supplemented with ascorbic and retinoic acids. Recombinant human growth hormone at 50 or 100 ng/ml, IGF-I at 100 or 200 ng/ml, or fetal calf serum at 20 % concentration {{were added to the}} media. Volumetric changes in serial sections of six tooth germs per treatment over 3 days of treatment (4, 5, 6 days in vitro) were compared by digitized morphometry. Mitotic indices were also compared and the cell densities of the <b>dental</b> <b>papillae</b> recorded. Qualitative ratings of differentiation were ascribed to each tooth germ by light microscopy. Differences in volume, mitotic activity and cell densities were found. The growth hormone-treated tooth germs were not larger than the serum-free ones but had increased mitotic indices and higher cell densities in the <b>dental</b> <b>papillae.</b> IGF-I-treated tooth germs had larger volumes than with all other treatments, e. g. germs treated with 200 ng/ml of IGF-I, after 6 days in culture, were significantly larger than with all other treatments (p < 0. 01 - < 0. 001). Whilst IGF-I-treated germs displayed the greatest extent of differentiation, growth hormone-treated germs also showed advanced differentiation compared to those on serum-free medium. These results suggest that growth hormone and IGF-I are involved in odontogenesis of murine teeth in vitro by affecting mitotic activity, tissue volume and cell differentiation. In conjunction with previous immunohistochemical studies that show expression of growth hormone receptor and IGF-I in developing teeth, these results provide evidence that both growth hormone and its mediator play a part in odontogenesis...|$|R

500|$|The tooth bud (sometimes {{called the}} tooth germ) is an {{aggregation}} of cells that eventually forms a tooth.

40|$|Lungfish are a {{group of}} ancient fish, {{represented}} almost continuously in the fossil record from their first appearance in the Devonian to the present time. They have numerous unique characters in the dentition, found only among lungfish, {{as well as some}} that are shared with other groups of fish and with higher vertebrates, such as a thin layer of true enamel, instead of the enameloid found in the dentition of most fish. Unique characters include the diversity of forms of dentine in the tooth plates, as well as the organisation of the dentines and the unusual mode of continuous growth of the dentition. Their enamel is based on amelogenin formed by the ameloblasts of the dental lamina, and is mineralised by long crystals of calcium hydroxyapatite deposited in layers over the developing tooth. The different forms of dentine, which show progressive evolutionary change within the group, are based on an extracellular matrix of collagen, mineralised with calcium hydroxapatite of variable crystalline form. Cells that line the oral cavity produce the ameloblasts that are endodermal in origin, and cells that form the <b>dental</b> <b>papillae</b> are, like the other cells that secrete skeletal tissues, derived from head mesoderm, as in other vertebrates.

40|$|Although Hertwig's {{epithelial}} {{root sheath}} (HERS) performs an important {{function in the}} formation of the tooth root, the developmental mechanisms that control HERS growth and differentiation remain to be thoroughly elucidated. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP 4), which is secreted by mesenchymal cells, acts on the dental epithelium as a regulator of cell differentiation during crown formation. In an effort to determine whether BMP 4 specifically regulates the development of HERS in the dental epithelium, we assessed the localizations of BMP 4, BMP receptor-IB (BMPR-IB), and BMPR-II during molar root formation in the mouse. HERS cells were shown to express BMPR-IB and BMPR-II. BMP 4 -positive cells were detected densely in the <b>dental</b> <b>papillae</b> around HERS, thereby suggesting that BMP 4 participated in HERS formation. Beads soaked in BMP 4, NOGGIN, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were implanted into the pulp cavity under culture conditions, and the length of HERS was evaluated with regard to the proliferating cells. After 12 h, both groups exhibited a similar HERS developmental pattern, with the length and shape of HERS bearing a close resemblance to one another. However, after 48 h, the observed HERS elongation was significantly shorter in the BMP 4 -treated group. In addition, proliferative cell nuclear antigens were detectable only in the NOGGIN- and PBS-treated groups. These findings demonstrate that mesenchymally expressed BMP 4 regulates HERS development by preventing elongation and maintaining cell proliferation.

2500|$|The {{adjacent}} layer of {{cells in the}} <b>dental</b> <b>papilla</b> suddenly increases in size and differentiates into odontoblasts, which are the cells that form dentin. Researchers believe that the odontoblasts would not form {{if it were not}} for the changes occurring in the IEE. As the changes to the IEE and the formation of odontoblasts continue from the tips of the cusps, the odontoblasts secrete a substance, an organic matrix, into their immediate surrounding. The organic matrix contains the material needed for dentin formation. [...] As odontoblasts deposit organic matrix termed predentin, they migrate toward the center of the <b>dental</b> <b>papilla.</b> Thus, unlike enamel, dentin starts forming in the surface closest to the outside of the tooth and proceeds inward.

BMP 9 -induced alkaline phosphatase activity, the expression of osteocalcin and osteopontin, and matrix mineralization in iSCAPs were inhibited by TNF-α in a dose-dependent fashion, although increased AdBMP 9 partially overcame TNF-α inhibition.
