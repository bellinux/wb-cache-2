500|$|The {{cabin crew}} started the evacuation, {{even before the}} plane {{had come to a}} halt, via both forward galley doors, both rear doors and the {{starboard}} overwing exits. Eighteen passengers escaped via the overwing exits before the fire grew too intense to use that route. The forward port galley door <b>escape</b> <b>slide</b> caught fire before it could be used, but one person jumped from there. 84 people escaped via the starboard galley door. Three of the crew escaped by the emergency cockpit rope. The rear starboard door <b>escape</b> <b>slide</b> had twisted on deployment, so Steward Taylor climbed down to straighten it, leaving stewardess Jane Harrison at the door assisting the passengers. Six passengers escaped via this route before the slide was punctured and deflated. Harrison encouraged the passengers to jump, and pushed out those too frightened to do so. 11 people escaped via this route, and five more escaped via the rear port door before the slide was destroyed. Harrison was last seen alive preparing to jump herself, but then she turned back and disappeared into the burning fuselage in an attempt to save the remaining four female passengers, including a disabled woman and eight-year-old girl. It was these actions which led to the award of the George Cross posthumously [...] to Harrison in recognition of her selfless gallantry. 35 people were injured, and five killed.|$|E

In addition to the precautions taken while hiring a new architect, a watchman was also hired to monitor the school grounds during all hours of the night.|$|E
50|$|Airplanes {{such as the}} Embraer 145 family, Fokker 50 family, Antonov An-148 family, ATR {{family and}} the Bombardier CRJ-200 family do not have <b>escape</b> <b>slides</b> because all exits are at a {{distance}} from the ground (less than 6 ft), below which evacuation assisting devices are not required by regulations. On the primary entrance door, 1L, some of these aircraft have stairs that are either connected to the door or drop down.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Escape</b> <b>slides</b> {{are packed}} and held within the door {{structure}} inside the slide bustle, a protruding {{part of the}} inside of an aircraft door that varies with aircraft size, door size and door location.

50|$|Heavily {{loaded with}} fuel and cargo, {{the plane was}} {{approaching}} too fast and too high {{to land on the}} scheduled runway 9. Sanders requested by radio to land on the longer runway 36L. Ignoring warning messages from the onboard computer and using a series of sharp turns that tested the DC-10's safety limits, Sanders landed the jet safely on the runway at well over its maximum designed landing weight. By that time, Calloway was once again restrained. Emergency personnel and police gained access to the plane via <b>escape</b> <b>slide</b> and ladder. Inside, they found the cockpit interior covered in blood. Calloway was then arrested and taken off the plane.|$|E
25|$|As {{there was}} a risk of fire from the leaking fuel, the {{commander}} ordered an emergency evacuation of the aircraft. Although the rear doors opened as intended and the evacuation slides deployed, both forward doors required considerable force to open them before all on board could evacuate the aircraft. No injuries were sustained in the evacuation. The investigation subsequently was able to replicate the difficulty in opening both forward doors on the One-Eleven. It was discovered that inadequate guidance from the manufacturer of the <b>escape</b> <b>slides</b> meant that they were incorrectly stowed. One door had an incorrect part fitted. A warning was issued to all One-Eleven operators and the relevant aviation authorities concerning this issue.|$|R
50|$|All large {{commercial}} aircraft have <b>escape</b> <b>slides</b> {{on the main}} doors of the plane, but some do not have slides over the wings, because when the flaps are fully lowered, the wings are low enough to the ground that passengers can evacuate safely. Some of these aircraft are the Embraer 190, Boeing 707, 717, 727 and 737. However, other aircraft {{require the use of}} overwing slides for the window exits to ensure that passengers can reach the ground quickly and safely. These include the Boeing 767, Boeing 757, and Airbus A320-series aircraft. Typically, overwing evacuation slides are not designed for use in ditching situations as they cannot be detached and will not operate, as the system is disabled by the aspirators on the slide taking in water, and Boeing recommends disarming the doors of a 747 before opening in a ditching situation.|$|R

5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{turned off}} the runway onto a short taxiway called link [...] "D" [...] {{and came to a}} full stop facing northwest. Evacuation efforts began immediately, but several difficulties were encountered. The purser tried to open the right front exit door about ten seconds before the aircraft stopped, but it would not open more than a [...] "crack" [...] due to a design fault in the emergency slide system. After about 25 seconds, the purser opened the left front door and successfully deployed the <b>escape</b> <b>slide.</b> At this time, the first two fire service appliances (i. e., fire trucks) arrived, and one began showering the fuselage and the open door with foam to prevent the fire from spreading to the door and the slide as passengers were evacuating, and to provide cooling to protect the passengers still inside. When the second appliance arrived, the first concentrated on the burning fuel and the left engine. The second appliance sprayed foam over the fuselage and the open door. During this time, the [...] "No 4 stewardess" [...] had kept passengers out of the forward galley area to allow the purser time to open a door. When the left side door was opened, a jam had developed in the narrow (22.5 inch-wide) passageway between the two forward galley bulkheads. The No 4 stewardess physically pulled the passengers out one at a time until the jam was relieved. Meanwhile, the purser had resumed working on the right front door, and he successfully opened the door fully and deployed the <b>escape</b> <b>slide</b> about one minute after the plane had stopped. Sixteen passengers and the No 4 stewardess escaped through the left front door, one of whom was unconscious and the No 4 stewardess dragged her out physically. The purser and 34 passengers made their escape through the right front door.|$|E
5000|$|If a rapid {{evacuation}} {{is required}} {{and the doors}} are opened while [...] "armed", {{the opening of the}} door pulls the slide pack out of the bustle (because the girt bar is physically attached to the aircraft floor). Due to the weight of both the door and the slide, great effort is involved in pushing the door open sufficiently to free the slide from the bustle, thus on larger aircraft a [...] "power assist" [...] function kicks in to aid the opening, either electrically or from compressed gas. Once the slide is completely free it will fall under gravity and after travelling a certain distance a pin will be pulled from a squib containing compressed gas and the slide will inflate. Should this system fail, the slide can be manually inflated by the cabin crew by pulling a manual inflation handle {{at the top of the}} slide. Should this also fail, standard operating procedures require the cabin crew to send passengers away from the door and to one that has a functioning <b>escape</b> <b>slide.</b>|$|E
