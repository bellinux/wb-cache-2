In addition to these weapons, many of the henchmen are physically different; the over-large Tee Hee had an iron claw, Jaws, an assassin with steel teeth, was played by 2.18m (7'2") actor Richard Kiel, whilst Renard (the henchman to the main villainess Elektra) survived being shot in the head, which progressively killed off <b>his</b> <b>senses</b> {{and his ability to}} feel pain.|$|E

5|$|A three-part series {{published}} between November 1993 and January 1994, {{the series}} introduces attorney Beck as a love interest for Brock. When Beck pursues {{a lawsuit against}} Scarmore Industries for employees poisoned by a sentient liquid-mercury virus, Venom is injured trying {{to protect her from}} the Juggernaut's kidnap attempt.

The symbiote overcomes the virus; Brock regains <b>his</b> <b>senses,</b> and Venom is returned to earth. Beck later insists on only being Brock's friend, because his romantic feelings for her make him more violent. Among DCD's 300 bestselling issues of 1993 Venom: The Madness #1 was number 173; the remaining issues did not chart.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Eragon {{continues}} his training, but is discouraged when the {{scar on his}} back causes him to have agonizing seizures multiple times per day. He has been swooning over Arya {{for most of the}} book. Saphira also has a similar problem with Glaedr, as she believes him to be a good choice for a mate and tries to win his affections. Eragon tells her it would not be proper, and she in turn replies that Arya is not as important as his education. Both efforts fail miserably, but bring Eragon and Saphira closer together. Later, at the ancient elven ceremony, the Agaetí Blödhren (Blood-Oath Celebration), Eragon is altered by a spectral dragon. The changes alter <b>his</b> <b>senses,</b> and enhance his abilities, effectively turning him into an elf-human hybrid, as well as healing all of his wounds, scars, and back injury. Reinvigorated, Eragon continues training until he learns that the Empire will soon attack the Varden in Surda. Afterward he confesses his feelings for Arya who rejects him harshly. Dismayed, he leaves without completing his training, to aid the Varden in battle.
