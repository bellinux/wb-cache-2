5000|$|Prunes {{are used}} in {{preparing}} both sweet and savory dishes. Stewed prunes, a compote, are a common dessert. Prunes are an ingredient in North African tagines or tzimmes, a traditional Jewish dish (in which the principal ingredient is diced or sliced carrots), in the Nordic prune kisel, eaten with rice pudding, and in the traditional Norwegian <b>dessert</b> <b>fruit</b> soup. Prunes have also been included in other holiday dishes, such as stuffing and cake. Prune-filled Danish pastries, yogurt or ice cream containing prunes or prune juice are found in some countries. Chocolate-covered prunes are a traditional confectionery in Eastern Europe. Prunes are also used to make juice and kompot (uzvar), a traditional drink in Europe. In the Cotswolds, prunes were fermented to form a cider-like drink called jerkum which, due to the high sugar content of prunes, was considered particularly potent in alcohol content compared to contemporary ciders and beers.|$|E
5000|$|This {{question}} {{appears in}} case 23 of the Mumonkan: CASE 23. ENO'S GOOD AND EVILEno, the sixth patriarch, was pursued by Monk Emyo up to Daiyurei. The patriarch, seeing Emyo coming, laid the robe and the bowl on a rock, {{and said to}} him, [...] "This robe represents the faith. Is it to be fought for by force? You may take them now." [...] Emyo went to move the bowl and the robe and yet they were as heavy as mountains. He could not move them. Hesitating and trembling, Emyo asked the patriarch, [...] "I come for the teaching, not for the robe. Please enlighten me!" [...] The patriarch said, [...] "What is primordially Emyo (i.e., your true self), {{if you do not}} think this is good nor {{do you think this is}} evil?" [...] At that moment Emyo was greatly awakened. His whole body was covered with sweat. Emyo cried, bowed, and said, [...] "Is there or is there not any other (deep) significance (in Zen) than your secret words and teachings a minute ago?" [...] The patriarch answered, [...] "What I have told you is no secret at all. Once you have realized your own true self, the depth (in Zen) rather belongs to you!" [...] Emyo said, [...] "When I was at Obai with the other monks, I never realized what my true self was. Now you have dispersed the clouds of my ignorance to realize it, just like a man capable of discerning warm and cold by tasting water. From now on you are my teacher!" [...] The patriarch said, [...] "We both have Obai for our teacher. Guard your own self!"Mumon's Comments:We should say that the sixth patriarch was in an emergency. This revelation of his, however, resembles the deed of an overly protective grandmother, who peeled a fresh lichi (a <b>dessert</b> <b>fruit),</b> removed its stone and put it to her grandchild's mouth ready for him to swallow.You describe it in vain, you picture it to no avail,Praising it is useless, cease to worry about it at all.It is your true self, it has nowhere to hide,Even if the universe is annihilated, it is not destroyed.|$|E

A significant effect (p< 0. 001) of age on the development of SSS was demonstrated in the study, yet only in the case of young people. The addition of flavour enhancers to pasta with Bolognese sauce intensified the occur-rence of sensory-specific satiety, however that effect appeared to depend on the sex of the examined and was distinctly higher in women than in men. It was also demonstrated that in the elderly the feeling of satiety occurred at a relatively lower intake of pasta with Bolognese sauce as compared to the young people and the addition of flavour enhancers had no significant effect on the content of energy ingested with a meal in both sex groups...|$|E
40|$|The guava {{fruit is}} an {{excellent}} source of fiber and vitamin C, but has low energy value. It is normally consumed fresh as a <b>dessert</b> <b>fruit.</b> Guava plantlet comes into flowering and fruiting at an early age, and that could be bearing all year around by pruning and other technique. The quality of guava fruits in Taiwan was increased and improved by bagging, pruning, cultivating method, and breeding. Guava is reportedly a climacteric fruit, but some cultivars cultivated in Taiwan as ‘Tai-Kuo Bar', 'Shyh-Jii Bar', and ‘Jen-Ju Bar', are exhibiting a typical non-climacteric type. The important cultivars are non-climacteric type in Taiwan and suitable for transportation in a long distance. According to the characteristic of guava in Taiwan, it has a potentiality in local market and exporting. The unstable quality is major problem in Taiwan. The objective of this experiment is to improving and stabilizing quality in guava by nutrient management. This study investigated four areas to establish the cultivation and management mode for guava. The first is the relationship between quality and leaf nutrient. The second is the effect of rootstock and cuttings on fruit quality and leaf nutrient. The third is the kinds of fertilizers for guava tree, and the fourth is the relationship between photosynthetic characteristic and fruit quality in guava cultivars. 番石榴果實富含膳食纖維及維生素C及低熱量。番石榴栽植後至結果期所需時期短，且配合修剪，已可週年生產，故能穩定供應市場所需。番石榴經由品種改良，修剪套袋等栽培措施，品質大幅提升。且目前主要栽培種果實屬為非更年型如泰國拔 世紀拔及珍珠拔等，具有耐貯運特性。綜合台灣地區番石榴之特性，應具有內外銷競爭潛力。但是番石榴產業仍存在不易克服之問題，其中以品質不穩定最為嚴重，本試驗擬從營養管理著手，以提升及穩定番石榴品質為目標。擬探討： 1. 葉片無機營養狀態和果實品質之關係。 2. 砧木及扦插苗對番石榴葉片營養及果實品質之影響。 3. 施肥種類及時期。 4. 番石榴葉片光合作用效率和品質之關係，以供育種及栽培之參考，以建立高品質之生產模式...|$|E

40|$|The pummelo, Citrus grandis (L.) Osbeck, is {{the most}} {{tropical}} of the citrus fruits, yet is poorly distributed, underutilized, and often unknown. It is an excellent fruit, however, which finds ready acceptance wherever tried. Pummelos probably originated in China but were carried to Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, where their evolution has continued and where many varieties are now available. The tree is large and spreading, with large, winged leaves, and frequently with thorns. The flower is very large for a citrus (3 - 5 cm in diameter), and the fruits vary from large to extra large. The rind is often thick. At maturity the sweet to subacid fruit vesicles separate easily from the membrane of the segments and are served in a dish as a <b>dessert</b> <b>fruit.</b> Varieties of pummelo can be classified as Thailand group (best tropical varieties), Chinese group (better suited to subtropics), and Indonesian group (extremely variable and sometimes inferior). The pummelo produces a monoembryonic, normal, sexual seed, and thus can be improved by breeding. Improved varieties are maintained by bud and cleft grafting {{as well as by}} marcotting. Culture {{is similar to that of}} other citrus trees, but the trees need somewhat larger growing areas. Cover crops or cash crops can be planted among the trees until they are too large. Normal chemical treatment schedules for pests and weeds can be used, but have not been adequately tried with the pummelo. Some pummelos are tolerant to foot rot, a disease that always requires careful treatment. Since flowering may occur several times a year, fruiting is irregular, but usually one harvesting season predominates. The fruit is picked just as it yellows or later, and is more flavorful when stored for several months. Because of its thick rind, the pummelo is easy to ship and keeps well even in common storage.
