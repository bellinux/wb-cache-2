Beryllium does not form oxides {{until it reaches}} very high temperatures. Tools made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In structural applications, the combination of high <b>flexural</b> <b>rigidity,</b> thermal stability, thermal conductivity and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays {{and other forms of}} ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of particle detectors. The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and beryllium oxide have led to their use in thermal management applications.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess whether cross-sectional areal properties, calculated from densitometry, correlate to the true flexural properties. Right and left male embalmed tibiae were used in the study. Prior to scanning, the proximal end of each tibia was potted in a fixture with registration pins, flushed thoroughly with water under pressure to remove trapped air, and then placed in a constant thickness water bath attached to a precision indexer. Two sets of three scans of the entire tibia were taken with an Hologic QDR 1000 /W densitometer at rotations of 0, 45, and 90 degrees about the tibia long axis. An aluminum step phantom and a bone step phantom, machined from bovine cortical bone, were also in the bath and scanned separately. Pixel attenuation data from the two sets of scans were averaged to reduce noise. Pixel data from the high energy beam were then converted to equivalent thicknesses using calibration equations. Cross-sectional areal properties (centroid, principal area moments and principal angle) along the length were computed from the three registered scans using methods developed in our laboratory. <b>Flexural</b> <b>rigidities.</b> Four strain gages were bonded around the circumference of each of 5 cross-sections encompassing the entire diaphysis. A known transverse load was then applied to the distal end and the bone was rotated 360 degrees in eight increments of 45 degrees each. Strains from the eight orientations were analyzed along with the known applied bending moments at each section to compute section centroids, curvatures, principal <b>flexural</b> <b>rigidities</b> and principal angle. Reference axes between the two methods were maintained within +/- 0. 5 degrees using an electronic inclinometer. Principal angles (flexural - areal) differed by - 2. 0 +/- 4. 0 degrees, and 1. 0 +/- 2. 5 degrees for the right and left tibia, respectively. Section principal <b>flexural</b> <b>rigidities</b> were highly correlated to principal areal moments (right: r(sup 2) = 0. 997; left: r(sup 2) = 0. 978) indicating a nearly constant effective flexural modulus. Right and left tibia exhibited a very high degree of symmetry when comparing either flexural or areal properties.

40|$|Predicting the {{time-dependent}} behaviour of {{prestressed concrete}} (PC) beams is crucial as time effects under serviceability loading {{can result in}} a critical loss of prestress. The conventional technique using moment–curvature (M/χ) to simulate the behaviour of PC beams is based on the Euler-Bernoulli corollary of a linear strain profile in which all deformations are accommodated through changes in the material strain, i. e. it is strain based. Consequently, the M/χ approach cannot directly accommodate discrete deformations associated with tension stiffening, such as the formation of individual cracks and reinforcement slip. Hence, the M/χ approach can simulate the behaviour prior to cracking purely through mechanics. However, for post-cracking behaviour it requires empirically derived correction factors, such as empirically derived <b>flexural</b> <b>rigidities,</b> to allow for the deformations associated with tension stiffening. This paper presents a displacement- based moment–rotation (M/Θ) approach for determining the behaviour of PC beams by applying the Euler-Bernoulli theorem of plane sections, as opposed to the conventional M/χ approach of a linear strain profile. Being based on plane sections, the M/Θ approach deals directly with displacements and, consequently, can simulate the mechanics of tension stiffening directly. The approach is shown to accommodate the time effects of concrete creep, shrinkage and reinforcement relaxation and can develop equivalent <b>flexural</b> <b>rigidities</b> directly from mechanics.

40|$|In this study, simple {{expressions}} for the, anistropic rigidities of orthogonally rib-stiffened {{reinforced concrete}} slab structures are presented. These expressions are valid for both, the pre-cracking and post-cracking stages of concrete, and are, therefore, applicable to reinforced {{as well as}} prestressed concrete structures. Bending and twisting tests on several orthogonally rib-stiffened reinforced concrete slab structures were conducted. The experimental results of twisting tests show that using shear reinforcement (stirrups) has {{a significant effect on}} increasing the pre-cracking and post-cracking torsional rigidities, so proposed equations for estimating these torsional rigidities were developed to properly account for the presence of stirrups. The experimental results of bending tests verify that using stirrups has no effect on both the pre-cracking and post-cracking <b>flexural</b> <b>rigidities,</b> so the existing equations for determining these <b>flexural</b> <b>rigidities</b> were not modified. The structural response of orthogonally rib-stiffened reinforced concrete slabs to loads was observed. It shows that using stirrups leads to ductile behavior of such structures. The experimental procedure and the necessary precautions that must be taken to help ensuring accurate results were discussed. The use of realistic estimates for the torsional constants of rib-stiffened reinforced concrete slab structures when using shear reinforcement will lead to better design as well as economy.
