A case study method was employed to investigate the Stanza Development Centre that is situated in Mamelodi, North Rand Region, Gauteng Province. The aim was to explore challenges faced by the centre to understand and get lessons of obstacles hampering success of service delivery in the centre {{in terms of the}} actual running of the income-generating projects and the skills training programmes. The findings demonstrated that training was provided to management to ensure that it is able to manage the centre effectively. The relationship among senior management, middle management, and beneficiaries is not severe to affect negatively the running of income-generation projects and skills training programme in the centre. In addition, material resources are available to facilitate the activities in the centre to take place. However, there are challenges facing the centre. Those include limited presentation of skills training programmes in the centre due to criteria set by the Department of Labour as a prerequisite to provide training. There is lack of collaboration among various sectors which results in fragmented provision of services and the impact thereof is not much visible. In addition, there is lack of growth of projects due to lack of after care support in terms of finance, marketing, business management, accommodation, or land. Most importantly, the lack of local government in promoting and integrating the income generation projects in their local <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> <b>programme</b> is an oversight, which is costing to the development of these projects to grow beyond survivalist projects...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{contribution}} of the Community <b>Economic</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Programme</b> (CED) run by The Open University of Tanzania in collaboration with the Southern New Hampshire University based in the United States of America in political and economic empowerment in Tanzania. The government of Tanzania in its efforts to facilitate the community empowerment process at both political and economic levels had resolved to institute political devolution and decentralization hence the establishment of the ongoing central and local government reforms. Embodied in these reforms are components such as capacity building and training for realisation of the reforms. Selectively, the study underscores the impacts and achievements in the sectors of capacity building and training through CED. The findings of the study support the contention that the ongoing reform programmes in the central and local government, require some intervention by other stake-holders in as far as capacity building and training is concerned. The study also underscores the levels attained in democratization, governance, empowerment and the degree of participatory practices all of which are objectives of the reforms. The findings of this study are based mainly on seven Councils that include Kilombero, Tandahimba, Mbozi, Rungwe, Babati, Kilwa and Mbeya. Responses from respondents have-to a large extent, thrown some light on the course of action to be taken with regard to capacity building and training. It can be noted that as one of the stakeholders, OUT- CED, has the potential to undertake the task of capacity building and training jointly with other stakeholders who are already involved in such exercises.

40|$|Abstract Background Maps can portray trends, patterns, {{and spatial}} {{differences}} {{that might be}} overlooked in tabular data and are now widely used in health research. Little has been reported {{about the process of}} using maps to communicate epidemiological findings. Method Population weighted raster maps show colour changes over the study area. Similar to the rasters of barometric pressure in a weather map, data are the health occurrence – a peak on the map represents a higher value of the indicator in question. The population relevance of each sentinel site, as determined in the stratified last stage random sample, combines with geography (inverse-distance weighting) to provide a population-weighted extension of each colour. This transforms the map to show population space rather than simply geographic space. Results Maps allowed discussion of strategies to reduce violence against women in a context of political sensitivity about quoting summary indicator figures. Time-series maps showed planners how experiences of health services had deteriorated despite a reform programme; where in a country HIV risk behaviours were improving; and how knowledge of an <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> <b>programme</b> quickly fell off across a region. Change maps highlighted where indicators were improving and where they were deteriorating. Maps of potential impact of interventions, based on multivariate modelling, displayed how partial and full implementation of programmes could improve outcomes across a country. Scale depends on context. To support local planning, district maps or local government authority maps of health indicators were more useful than national maps; but multinational maps of outcomes were more useful for regional institutions. Mapping was useful to illustrate in which districts enrolment in religious schools – a rare occurrence - was more prevalent. Conclusions Population weighted raster maps can present social audit findings in an accessible and compelling way, increasing the use of evidence by planners with limited numeracy skills or little time to look at evidence. Maps complement epidemiological analysis, but they are not a substitute. Much less do they substitute for rigorous epidemiological designs, like randomised controlled trials. </p...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{consensus}} globally {{about the significance of}} developing local and regional economies in order to create sustainable livelihood for local communities. The policy discourse in South Africa and elsewhere as well as the immense body of literature on local economic development bears testimony to this reality (Nel 1994,Tomlinson 1994, Rogerson 2003, World Bank 2002). The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (Act 108 of 1996) and the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act (Act 36 of 2000) enshrine the role of municipalities in enhancing the economic growth and development, and harnessing the social wellbeing of the communities ‘through creation of employment opportunities and redistribution of resources’. Importantly, this legislative framework must be accompanied by, on the one hand proper structures and political will, {{and on the other hand}} provision of resources and institutional capacity for realization of the long term objectives of Local Economic Development (LED). In order to be successfully mainstreamed and implemented the LED must be embodied within the legally prescribed Integrated Development Plans. In addition, the LED strategy must be incorporated within the Provincial Growth and Development Strategies (PGDS). In this research an exploration of the Local <b>Economic</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Programme</b> on the Blue Crane Route Municipality with specific reference to Cookhouse was investigated. The primary aim of this study was to establish the views of the residents regarding their perceptions of the LED and its effects in terms of addressing current poverty related problems and their view on the proposed wind farm project, to investigate the proposed implementation process of LED project, specifically at Cookhouse. The second objective of this research was to present empirical data from both a questionnaire completed by 18 respondents and two interviews, that helps amplify and verify the impact of LED at BCRM. The question answered was whether the proposed wind farm will make an impact on the lives of the ordinary people at Cookhouse. The final objective of this research to identify the shortcomings in the LED development process in the BCRM and to make recommendations on feasible actions that could be employed to alleviate poverty. The findings of the research suggest that the proposed project should be evaluated taking the themes of social, environmental and economic aspects of sustainable development into account. Also the findings of the research have noted that community members are not aware of what opportunities this project will bring to the community of Cookhouse. It should be noted that when this project was identified, the community was never consulted and now it’s very difficult at this stage to reject the project since there employment opportunities. Therefore local authorities are constitutionally obliged create space for community participation, which warrants accessibility and availability of information to local communities to enable to participate effectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this study is to assess the extent to which the Turkic people of Kazakhstan and Sinkiang have been aligned {{politically}} and socially with the socialist societies of their respective countries. It is not intended to consider this question in the light of success or failure. There are several reasons for not doing so. It would be realistic to consider the question in this light only if a definite goel was to be achieved within a specified period of time. This was not the case in either Kazakhstan or Sinkiang. There was and is no definable period of time within which Communism is to be I I achieved. Equally important, Communism remains a hazy expression for a state of existence that yet has to be defined in a manner that is universally accepted. In this study the various political, cultural, religious and educational aspects of the Turkic people will be considered. The intention is to discover to what extent these traditions have been replaced by the social institutions of the socialist societies. This in turn should allow some insight into the advances made by both the Russian and Chinese Communists in their attempts to transform their respective Turkic people. At the same time the study deals with specific difficulties that the Governments had to overcome in the course of the transformation process. These include getting the Turkic people to participate in the various socialist institutions. From this there arise new questions and problems. The Islamic society of the Turkic people had not prepared the latter to participate in a modern, industrial society. They lacked the required educational background to be usefully employable in the bureaucracy on any but a superficial level. As a result non-Turkic cadres had to be used in many leading positions. This raised the question of great Russian and Han-Chinese chauvinism. Another problem was that of attacking the traditional Turkic way of life without alienating the Turkic people. The direct attack on Islam was complex. In general both Governments demonstrated a lack of understanding for the Islamic way of life. As a consequence they launched an attack on an Islamic orthodoxy that did not exist. Also, the Soviet policy of an outright attack forced the Soviet Government to define a new way of life for the Kazakh and other Muslim people. In China the need for this was avoided because of the less antagonistic attitude towards Islam. To a great extent this study compares the policies of the Soviet and Chinese Governments. This in itself raises some questions. The Russian revolution preceded the Chinese by nearly 32 years. This gave the Chinese a considerable advantage. They did not have to make the same mistakes that ha been made by the Soviet Union, particularly the collectivisation drive in Kazakhstan. But the Chinese not only benefitted from the Soviet mistakes. They'were able also to make use of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in advancing their <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> <b>programme.</b> In addition the more industrially advanced Soviet Union could and did assist the Chinese in their industrialisation. From the discussion of the connection between the two countries their logically follows an assessment of the inter-state relationship. The intention is to discover to what extent the Turkic people influenced the Sino-Soviet relationship. But the economic question hardly can be excluded from the discussion. This in turn leads to the analysis of some of the historical) -political, ideological and economic causes of the Sino-Soviet rift...|$|E

In the context of GIZ’s Sustainable <b>Economic</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Programme</b> in Kyrgyzstan, the German development agency tasked SLE to perform the study out its Jalal-Abad office, with the following subtasks: - Studied three value chains (apple, tomato and plum) partly; - Has interviewed companies producing and processing those commodities and - Has analyzed the national quality infrastructure (NQI) serving the three. Following a similar task in Ghana, SLE developed a qualitative research methodology with a five week stay in Kyrgyzstan. Through 60 interviews mainly with food processors, but also including farmers, quality infrastructure (QI) service providers and GIZ partners, the three staff SLE team prepared recommendations after verifying them in workshops. Three recommendation groups were developed: 1. 	Strengthen utilization of formal market demands as driver for improved Food Safety and QI 2. 	Widen scope of Kyrgyz QI services and increase clients’ satisfaction in order to boost QI utilization 3. 	Flank intervention in quality management through facilitating investment climate Background and Task This summary condensates the SLE study on how quality infrastructure in three value chains can contribute to economic growth in southern Kyrgyzstan. In the context of GIZ’s Sustainable <b>Economic</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Programme</b> in Kyrgyzstan, the German development agency operates {{an office in the}} rural South Fergana Valley. Based out of that office in Jalal-Abad, this research consultancy has: •	Studied three value chains (apple, tomato and plum) partly; •	Has interviewed companies producing and processing those commodities and •	Has analyzed the national quality infrastructure (NQI) serving the three. These steps were taken in order to come up with recommendations how to support economic growth in rural Kyrgyzstan through specific interventions. The Kyrgyz national economy is still much depending on Russia, 27 years after Soviet Union’s breakup. Yet, many young Kyrgyz people migrate to Russia instead of farming on their families’ properties with the consequence of them not being available in the Kyrgyz national labor market. Stemming from Soviet’s era, the Quality Infrastructure (QI) subsector serves companies and their customers alike through Metrology, Standardization, Testing, Certification and Accreditation. The -mostly governmental- NQI operates on the policy level out of the capital, the regional hubs such as Osh being relevant to Jalal Abad and on the county level (oblast). Besides supplying national Kyrgyz markets, exports play a particular role as they are relevant to apple and plum products. Since the accession of Kyrgyzstan to the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) with Russia, Belarus, Armenia and Kazakhstan, export regulations are expected for summer 2017. In light of this the client defined the main research questions as to how to improve food safety and how quality infrastructure services can contribute to creating job opportunities, especially for youth. Methodology Having completed a study of Ghana’s national quality infrastructure in 2015, the Seminar Ländliche Entwicklung (SLE) has been commissioned by GIZ to perform this task, replicating partially the methods and partly in personal union. Given the explorative character of the Kyrgyzstan study, and in coordination with the client during the inception phase, a qualitative approach was adopted. Given the results of the research in Ghana showing the best chances of QI utilization on the medium size company level, the Kyrgyzstan study focused on food processors. The three expatriate SLE consultants designed a five week field phase, flanked by two national Kyrgyz experts. Supported by GIZ’s logistics, the SLE team spent a week in each value chain. The interviews covered 20 food processing companies; three farmers and one retailer were interviewed. 18 interviews were conducted with service providers in the quality infrastructure sector. The total of sixty interviews included also six with development agencies, partly in GIZ partnership. During the final stages, recommendation workshops were hold in Jalal Abad and Bishkek with the purpose of verifying the results and recommendations. Findings and Observations Some out of many observations shall be reflected here: The interviews with producers revealed that EAEU markets, especially Russia are highly relevant to them and will become even more once compliance with customs regulations become obligatory, foreseen in 2017. Looking at the type of producer and processor, the research found a “dual-economy” existing with informal markets for fresh products and formal markets requiring certifiable quality management. Given the formal markets concluding contracts between producers, processors and their clients also concerning quality characteristics, it results in a higher chance of quality management and QI services playing a role. Pondering obligatory and voluntary use of QI, this research applied the assumption that formal markets impose quality regimes sparing the authorities from obligating farmers, processors and exporters as well as policing compliance. On paper, Kyrgyz NQI should function, but in reality this is barely in position to check compliance of products being exported to EAEU countries. While the EAEU is supposed to equip Kyrgyz QI providers even in regions, much is left to be done. Since soviet past, the line ministries for agriculture and health shared the task of maintaining QI services. However, given the nowadays’ involvement of the state inspectorate, exporters have to check compliance for each authority the same characteristics. This duplication withholds willing QI customers and frustrates them, instead of facilitating their work. With 28 ’ 000 out of the total 150 ’ 000 tones annual apple production, apple products are subject to export regulations. In so far, EAEU’s customs union is very relevant, which can even become restrictive, like it was observable with potatoes evading quality infrastructure. Apple juice, which is examined by health authorities additionally for sanitary reasons, requires quality infrastructure services, but does lack inspection. Given this situation, Kyrgyz apples or products more generally do not reach lucrative markets. Like apple, the pomicultures plum is growing in orchards typically planted back in Soviet times. The up to 20 ’ 000 tons of Plums produced annually, are dried in order to conserve them with the few micro-drying facilities. However, even more is sold to intermediaries who partly export them to more lucrative markets, through Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Hardly any QI service utilization was observed. Tomatoes are produced on some 10 ’ 000 ha of fields in Southern Kyrgyzstan. 60 % of these tomatoes are processed to juices and paste, where hygiene and quality regimes apply. On the fields, fertilizer is applied leading to a necessity to analyze Nitrate concentrations, yet hardly any QI utilization has been observed. In all three value chains, it would be required using Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) because it is the most effective and economic way to combat food safety problems. Nevertheless, HACCP is not mandatory in the EAEU quality management and training has been too theoretical. While organic products do not play any role on Kyrgyz national markets, there is an opportunity for European markets. Already now, Kyrgyz Walnuts, plums and other are exported to Turkey, and partly re-dispatched onwards to the EU. A few European processors even invest directly, such as in Kyrgyz nuts. However, in order to do so, they utilize their own company based quality management. Nevertheless, given the growing EU organic market, an opportunity arises for Kyrgyz plums, dried apples, herbal spices and more. This is even more relevant, given the national quality infrastructure contributing. Looking at job opportunities, income generation and youth’s migration, the youth’s multitude of motives for leaving the country presented itself. Youth also leaves rural South in order to be in reach of urban opportunities from mobile phone access to training opportunities. The research concludes that in order to influence migration, the necessary condition is an integrated program offering job opportunities Results and recommendations Summarizing all three value chains, quality infrastructure is utilized rarely by farmers and micro-scale processors, also because National QI is concentrated in Bishkek. In order to solve this, QI services need to be offered on the producer level in relevant villages. Extending services on village level also involves consultancy as to how translating the QI results in a proper HACCP management. Already now, Quality infrastructure is not utilized sufficiently to access profitable markets. The reason is partly the high cost, the unawareness by producers and partly the poor presence in relevant fields and area. Given the poor scope of tests and compliance checks, farmers and processors risk having to check twice quality properties. Consequently, and in order to comply with EAEU regulations already during 2017, the rejection risk of Kyrgyz products grows. In light of this, it is recommended to stimulate QI utilization, widen the scope of QI services and facilitate general economic conditions as follows: 1. 	In order to use formal market demand as driver for improved Food Safety and QI – service utilization in selected value chains (VC) it is necessary to: a. 	improve the linkage of local VC actors with formal markets b. 	facilitate compliance of local VC actors with market requirements 2. 	QI utilization should grow through fulfillment of two recommendations. a. 	In order to increase QI service utilization, the necessary condition is to increase its scope. b. 	The sufficient condition is customers satisfied with easy access, speed and precision of service. 3. 	Besides these two main recommendations, general conditions should augment room for change...|$|E

First, some aspects of the standard notion of competitiveness are discussed. Then some key indicators of the competitiveness of Hungarian regions will be investigated. I shall end by introducing the so-called pyramid model, which has been designed to measure and improve regional competitiveness...|$|R

South Africa had to adapt and conform to the prevailing global economic architecture and adhere to neo-liberal principles prevailing at the time while at home it had to face a restructuring economy and worsening social conditions {{for a majority of}} its people: unemployment, housing and infrastructure backlogs. Policies and programmes where devised and adopted. The EPWP and local <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> are just two of the many programmes meant to deal with unemployment, skills development, inequality and poverty. This report investigates the potential of the EPWP as a tool for local <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> by reviewing the theoretical underpinnings of public works and local economic development; and the intergovernmental relations and planning policies, processes, mechanisms, and institutional arrangements in place to enable the programmes’ implementation.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{findings from}} {{a project that}} intended to enhance the capacity of HAMASA Sanaa Group, a youth non-governmental organization which promote positive youth development and their involvement in community development processes taking place in their community by through investigating the views and behavior of young people aged between 14 and 24 in relation to youth development, youth groups and community development processes. The subject of youth participation in both local and national development processes has been an ongoing concern in Tanzania and elsewhere since the early 1990 s. In this context {{the author of this}} report undertook this project {{under the auspices of the}} Community <b>Economic</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Programme</b> of the Southern New Hampshire (US) University and the Open University of Tanzania to investigate the reasons why young people are not participating in community development processes and consider what, if anything, could be done to increase their participation through implementing a capacity building project of HAMASA. For the purpose of this paper, Community development processes were recognized as those grassroots processes by which communities; become more responsible; organize and plan together; develop healthy options; empower themselves; reduce ignorance, poverty and suffering; create employment and economic opportunities; and Achieve social, economic, cultural and environment goals. The Hananasifu Unplanned settlement is located within Kinondoni Municipal, about 4 kilometers from the Dar-es-Salaam city centre. It is accessible from Kawawa road. The settlement occupies about 50 hectares of land sharing borders with the planned neighborhoods of Kinondoni on the northern side, Kawawa road on the western side and Magomeni and Msimbazi valley on the southern side. The community development processes that were taking place in Hananasifu included construction and maintenance of large drainage channels constructed by a community based organization, Hananasifu Community Development Association (HCDA) under funding from the ILO, HIV/AIDS prevention campaigns and home based care for people living with HIV/AIDS, support and care of orphans, construction and maintenance of water points and participation in water user committees, environmental sanitation, security and peace of their street and participating in decision making forums such as in the street government and in political parties. Project participants were HAMASA members, local government agencies in Kinondoni Municipal responsible for youth development and community development department, community members and NGOs serving youth and international NGOs dealing with capacity building of local NGOs in Tanzania. To achieve this objective, the project first conducted a participatory action research based on interviews, questionnaires, focus group discussions and observation to gather data and identify community, local authorities and youth perceptions on Youth development and how they can engage effectively in community development processes. SWOT analysis of HAMASA was conducted as part of the research on youth organizations or groups. Capacity building tools such as Organizations Self-Assessments were used to understand the capacity needs of HAMASA Sanaa Group so that they can enable the youth of Hananasifu to engage effectively in community development processes and promote positive youth development. Evidence in this report confirms that the youth are concerned about a range of issues. Many of these relate to the community perception on youth, support, local and national policy agenda although they often are not perceived in this way. Even though the youth seldom mentioned local development processes explicitly as a concern, a number of the issues such as the availability of spaces for petty businesses and local leisure facilities fall under the jurisdiction of the local authority and/or national government. The research found that both the youth and community members had different views on the exact ages of people who constitute the youth group, the meaning and importance of youth development, importance of youth involvement in development processes and there were differences on the reasons which make young people form organizations such as HAMASA and the benefits they get from such groups. The research concluded that it is on the basis of these differing views and negative perceptions on youths and their organizations that youth are not trusted and involved adequately in community development processes within their community. The SWOT analysis and organizational self-assessment found that HAMASA like many other emerging NGOs had many organizational weaknesses that were hampering its capacity to support youth participate effectively in community development processes. The issues that were identified from the research were implemented in a model for building the organizational capacity of HAMASA Sanaa Group. The capacity building approach was implemented by facilitating HAMASA to understand how they real work through an Organization Self-Assessment (OSA) and undertaking several priority activities on the areas that were seen crucial from the OSA. These included: reviewing the constitution of HAMASA to make it more clear and focused, developing the vision and mission statements, to improve documentation and provision of relevant information to the youth by establishing a resource centre, improving networking and linkages with other stakeholders, improving fundraising skills by developing a project proposal and lastly by improving theatre arts and drama skills of the youth by accessing training from the University of Dar-es-Salaam.

The social value of urban agriculture, such as improving food security, developing a sense of community and promoting ecological conservation, is well documented. But in order to effectively contribute to development agendas, urban agriculture must also present viable, sustainable economic opportunities. This study sets forth vegetable box schemes as a context-appropriate, economically feasible urban agriculture enterprise for which there is growing consumer demand. A survey of 354 subscribers to vegetable box schemes in Cape Town is analysed, finding these households source half of their fresh produce and a quarter of their total groceries from box schemes. The study explores dimensions of consumer satisfaction and considers ways in which box schemes may be expanded. This paper also offers a brief comparison of different box scheme models in order to demonstrate that a development-oriented social enterprise model can compete with other for-profit models in the market...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{more and}} more {{scholars}} of regional science {{are interested in the}} role of agglomeration economies in the knowledge-based economy. This issue can be dealt with from different points of view: the competitive type of functional or nodal regions and one has to examine the factors influencing regional competitiveness. To improve competitiveness of regions, different <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> <b>programmes</b> must be applied, which means that the improvement of competitiveness requires different strategies based on the different types of regions. In this paper we outline our analytical framework: the pyramid model of regional competitiveness and the UFO-model of cluster-based regional <b>economic</b> <b>development.</b> After introducing, we are going to investigate into the competitiveness of Hungarian microregions (LAU 1). Our statistical analysis to underline the classification of microregions by competitiveness types is based on a complex methodology of multi-variable data analysis. For the investigation of agglomeration economies in these different types of microregions we apply the location quotient (LQ) method and Ellison-Glaeser-index of traded sectors. The Local Moran Index (LISA), which can be interpreted as the local index of spatial autocorrelation, is used to calculate the neighbourhood effects of the microregions. ...|$|R
