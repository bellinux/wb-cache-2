Räikkönen had reportedly only left his home {{at the last moment}} {{to make it to the}} Grand Prix after considering not racing at all in the event. On Friday, Räikkönen then publicly threatened that he would not continue to race with Lotus in the remaining two Grands Prix of the season after Abu Dhabi unless the salary dispute was resolved. In the Saturday's qualifying, Räikkönen made it to 5th, but was demoted to the 22nd and last grid spot due to his E21 car failing a post-qualifying floor <b>deflection</b> <b>test.</b> In the race, he immediately made contact with Giedo van der Garde's Caterham in the first corner of the first lap and broke his Lotus's right front suspension, forcing Räikkönen to retire on the first lap for the first time since the 2006 United States Grand Prix. Immediately after being recovered, he left the circuit and returned to his hotel while the race continued, further fueling tensions between him and the team. Despite this, following the race, it was announced that Lotus and Räikkönen had reached a provisional agreement on the salary dispute that would see Räikkönen race for the team during the remainder of the season as the investment group Quantum Motorsports said that they had concluded long-running negotiations with Lotus for acquisition of a share in the team, providing the team with financial security.|$|E

40|$|Pavement {{management}} systems (PMS) have historically relied on distress (e. g., cracking, and rutting) and roughness (e. g., International Roughness Index or IRI) as key pavement performance indicators in the decisions-making process. Both are important indicators that merit emphasis within the PMS process, {{but they are}} not the only ones. Structural adequacy, for example, is another important pavement performance indicator that is critical to making rational pavement rehabilitation decisions. And indeed, more and more highway agencies in the USA are incorporating <b>deflection</b> <b>testing</b> as part of their routine PMS activities. <b>Deflection</b> <b>testing</b> for the structural evaluation of pavements has been around for decades. Falling Weight Deflectometers (FWDs) represent the state-of-the-practice in pavement deflection testing; however, FWD testing is a stop-and-go operation that requires lane closures (hence can cause traffic disruptions and create a safety hazard) and that has limited production rates. To overcome these shortcomings, a number of organizations have developed moving pavement <b>deflection</b> <b>testing</b> devices.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Björk-Shiley 60 ° convexo-concave {{prosthetic}} {{heart valves}} (Shiley, Inc, Irvine, Calif, {{a subsidiary of}} Pfizer, Inc) {{continue to be a}} concern for approximately 35, 000 nonexplanted patients worldwide, with approximately 600 events reported to the manufacturer to date. Fractures of the outlet struts of the valves began to appear in the early 1980 s and have continued to the present, but their causes are only partially understood. Methods: A matched case-control study was conducted evaluating manufacturing records for 52 valves with outlet strut fractures and 248 control subjects matched for age at implantation, valve size, and valve position. Results: In addition to the risk factors recognized as determinants of outlet strut fracture, the United Kingdom case-control study has observed 7 - to 9 -fold increased risk with performance of multiple hook <b>deflection</b> <b>tests.</b> This test was performed more than once, usually after rework on the valve. Six valves in this study underwent multiple hook <b>deflection</b> <b>tests,</b> of which 4 experienced an outlet strut fracture. Cracks and further rework were noted for these valves. Significant associations were also observed between outlet strut fracture and disc-to-strut gap measurements taken before the attachment of the sewing ring. Conclusions: It is our view that a combination of factors related to valve design, manufacturing process, and patient characteristics are responsible for outlet strut fractures of Björk-Shiley convexo-concave valves. Multiple hook <b>deflection</b> <b>tests</b> have emerged as a potential new risk factor for outlet strut fracture in both The Netherlands and the United Kingdom. This factor appears to be correlated with the presence of other abnormalities. A further study is needed to investigate the factors correlated with multiple hook <b>deflection</b> <b>tests.</b> On confirmation of risk, the presence of multiple hook <b>deflection</b> <b>tests</b> may be added to equations, quantifying the risk of outlet strut fracture for comparison against risk of mortality and serious morbidity from explant operations.

40|$|The Benkelman Beam {{structural}} test of flexible pavements was replaced in 1976 by dynamic <b>deflection</b> <b>testing</b> {{with a model}} 400 Road Rater. The Road Rater is used to determine structural ratings of flexible pavements. New pavement construction in Iowa has decreased with a corresponding increase of restoration and rehabilitation. A method to determine structural ratings of layered systems and rigid pavements is needed to properly design overlay thickness. The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate the feasibility of using the Road Rater to determine support values of layered systems and rigid pavements. This evaluation was accomplished by correlating the Road Rater with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Thumper, a dynamic <b>deflection</b> <b>testing</b> device. Data were obtained with the Road Rater and Thumper at 411 individual test locations on 39 different structural sections ranging from 10 " of PCC pavement and 25 " of asphalt pavement to a newly graveled unpaved roadway. A high correlation between a 9000 pound Thumper deflection and the 1185 pound Road Rater deflection was obtained. A Road Rater modification has been completed to provide 2000 pound load inputs.
