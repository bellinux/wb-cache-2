40|$|The <b>environmental</b> <b>burdens</b> of Chinese copper {{production}} {{have been identified}} and quantified {{in the context of}} typical technologies, materials supplies and environmental emissions by a life cycle approach. Primary and secondary {{copper production}} using copper ores and scraps, respectively, were analyzed in detail. The flash and bath smelting approaches and the recycling of copper scraps were selected as representative copper production processes. A quantitative analysis was also conducted to assess the influence of material transport distance in copper production. Life cycle assessment (LCA) results showed that resources depletion and human health contribute significantly to <b>environmental</b> <b>burdens</b> in Chinese copper production. In addition, the secondary copper production has dramatically lower <b>environmental</b> <b>burdens</b> than the primary production. There is no obvious distinction in overall <b>environmental</b> <b>burdens</b> in primary copper production by flash or bath smelting approach. However, resources depletion is lower and the damage to human health is higher for flash smelting approach. Ecosystem quality damage is slight for both approaches. <b>Environmental</b> <b>burdens</b> from the mining stage contribute most in all life cycle stages in primary copper production. In secondary copper production, the electrolytic refining stage dominates. Based on the life cycle assessment results, some suggestions for improving environmental performance were proposed to meet the sustainable development of Chinese copper industry...|$|R

40|$|According to the {{definition}} given by the Finnish Committee for Sustainable Development, the ecological criteria for sustainable development are the preservation of biodiversity and adoption of human activities to the natural resources and tolerance of nature. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) process is {{used to assess the}} environmental effects over the entire life of the product or activity. In the methodology of LCA the environmental assessment is normally based on the account of <b>environmental</b> <b>burdens</b> that can be quantitatively dealt with, which includes harmful emissions into air, water and soil and consumption of resources (energy, water, materials and land). The potential harmful changes in the environment created by these burdens are dealt with, such as the potential global warming induced by carbon dioxide or potential acidification induced by oxides of sulphur and nitrogen. Environmental impact of building products consists of procurement of raw material, manufacture items (raw materials and product) and also the use of energy resources during transportation – all of which <b>burden</b> the environment. <b>Environmental</b> <b>burdens</b> of concrete and concrete products consist of limestone quarrying, burning and grinding of clinker, extraction, excavation and crushing of cement stone materials, manufacturing and transportation of raw materials and the final product. The <b>environmental</b> <b>burdens</b> of concrete, hollow-core slabs, roofing tiles, exterior wall panels, concrete beams and columns are dealt with in the assessment. The differences in <b>environmental</b> <b>burdens</b> between various concrete products are a consequence of different binder contents and types, long transportation distances of raw materials and products and different electricity consumption especially in the production phases.

40|$|Industrial {{solid waste}} has {{potential}} impacts on soil, water and air quality, {{as well as}} human health, during its whole life stages. A framework for the life cycle management of industrial solid waste, which integrates the source reduction process, is presented and applied to copper slag management. Three management scenarios of copper slag are developed: (i) production of cement after electric furnace treatment, (ii) production of cement after flotation, and (iii) source reduction before the recycling process. A life cycle assessment is carried out to estimate the <b>environmental</b> <b>burdens</b> of these three scenarios. Life cycle assessment {{results showed that the}} <b>environmental</b> <b>burdens</b> of the three scenarios are 2710. 09, 2061. 19 and 2145. 02 Pt respectively. In consideration of the closed-loop recycling process, the environmental performance of the flotation approach excelled that of the electric furnace approach. Additionally, although flash smelting promotes the source reduction of copper slag compared with bath smelting, it did not reduce the overall <b>environmental</b> <b>burdens</b> resulting from the complete copper slag management process. Moreover, it led to the shifting of <b>environmental</b> <b>burdens</b> from ecosystem quality damage and resources depletion to human health damage. The case study shows {{that it is necessary to}} integrate the generation process into the whole life cycle of industrial solid waste, and to make an integrated assessment for quantifying the contribution of source reduction, rather than to simply follow the priority of source reduction and the hierarchy of waste management...|$|R

Life-cycle assessment methodology {{was used to assess}} the <b>environmental</b> <b>burdens</b> associated with self-generated electricity (SGE) and proposed embedded power generation in Nigeria.

A mandatory diesel fuel displacement with Jatropha biodiesel can reduce annual GHG emissions from SGE by 76 % provided combined cycle power plants are adopted for embedded power generation. The magnitude of these benefits would depend on material inputs, seed yield as well as the environmental status of the reference fuel.
