40|$|Forty-eight {{openings}} of 30, 60, and 90 feet {{in diameter}} were created in previously unmanaged mixed conifer-hardwood stands on a high-quality site in northern California in 1963. They were an attempt to convert an essentially even-aged forest to an uneven-aged arrangement and comprised the initial cut in the <b>group-selection</b> <b>system.</b> Five conifers and three hardwoods produced 36 seed crops that ranged from very light to heavy during the 10 -year study period (1964 - 1973). Sound seed for four conifer species combined (not sugar pine) for 10 years amounted to the equivalent of more than 302, 900 seeds per acre and, in general, {{did not differ significantly}} among opening sizes. Shade and roots from bordering trees were major influences on seedling survival and development in the openings. Density of established conifer and hardwood seedlings (at least 4 years old) ranged from 12 per acre for incense-cedar in 90 -foot openings to about 9, 600 ponderosa pines per acre in 60 -foot openings after 10 years, and did not differ significantly among opening sizes. Conifer seedling heights ranged from 0. 8 to 1. 7 feet after 9 years. Average height of ponderosa pines and hardwoods differed significantly between the largest and smallest opening size with height being best in the largest. Normally multi-stemmed and wide-crowned shrubs were conspicuous by their single spindly stems...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1994 In the Pacific Northwest, a {{transition}} has begun that is shifting many practices in forest management. Traditionally, harvesting and regeneration {{has been done}} through clearcutting which removes all trees in the area being cut and plants an entirely new stand. Clearcutting is often the most efficient method for harvesting forests since implementation and other costs are kept to a minimum, while yields and revenues are maximized by removing all of the timber. Now, however, ecosystem and aesthetic concerns are directing forest management away from clearcutting, which usually impairs both, and toward other methods that are less damaging to the environment. Many of these alternative systems can be classified under the heading New Forestry. " Typically, their applications involve leaving live trees on the site after a cutting, thereby creating a more diversified stand than would a clearcut. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the timber volumes and financial yields between New Forestry techniques and clearcutting. Two alternative systems of management were designed to represent variations on the New Forestry theme. The first was a two-story technique where the stand would consist of two distinct size classes, and all harvests would leave a few trees scattered throughout the site. The second alternative method was a <b>group-selection</b> <b>system</b> that would consist of multiple entries removing small patches of a stand at a time. It was determined that managing two-story stands would reduce volume yields by 3 % to 29 % and financial yields by 6 % to 15 % depending on the number of live trees left after harvest. Group-selection stands reduced average annual volume yields by 6 % or 10 % and financial yields by 33 % or 45 % depending on the number of entries in a rotation. A financial analysis with price premiums for larger logs was also performed, but the yields did not experience much of a change...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an analysis of the position and density of a secondary road network in the <b>group-selection</b> management <b>system.</b> The research was conducted in the economic unit Prosara in the north west of the Republic of Srpska. The network of skid roads in the analyzed sections was recorded using the GPS devices Garmin GPS 60 and Garmin Map 62 st, and the analysis software package used was ESRI ArcInfo 10. 1. Adhering to the general guidelines, the slope of skid roads was analyzed within six predefined intervals: 0 - 12 %, 12 - 16 %, 16 - 20 %, 20 - 30 %, 30 - 40 % and over 40 %. Relative openness with a secondary road network was determined for a maximum distance between the skid roads of 130 m and it ranged from 82. 62 % to 96. 37 %. Such openness was classified as very good and excellent. Together with all factors related to stand and terrain characteristics, it appears that in all the compartments, the density of the secondary network of skid roads is adequate for the application of a skidder with a winch, without extending above the maximum length of the winch rope. Out of the total length of analyzed skid roads, 24 % is within an appropriate slope interval for a planned conversion to truck roads, whereas 37 % is the maximum slope from the ecological point of view. The average terrain slope for the whole analyzed area is 26. 4 %. Such moderately sloping terrain is suitable for the construction of skid roads with low investment and small environmental impact. Due to their specific configuration, the main skid roads were designed along the ridge, while the secondary and tertiary skid roads most often separated from them at the maximum slope, forming an irregular fish bone shape...|$|R
