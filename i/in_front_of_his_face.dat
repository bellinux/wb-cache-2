5|$|Lack of {{patronage}} led to Pentland folding his businesses {{and taking a}} job in 1930 as a pilot with Australian National Airways (ANA), a new airline founded by Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm. By 1932, ANA was in trouble as well, and Pentland left to set up as a dairy farmer on a property he bought at Singleton. Within two years, drought forced him to sell the land and he returned to earning his living as a pilot, instructing at aero clubs in Queensland and New South Wales. By late 1937, he was again employed as a transport pilot in New Guinea, where {{he was known as}} a practical joker who liked to hold a map <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> in apparent short-sightedness and ask his passengers if they could see a landing ground anywhere. He returned to Australia after war was declared in September 1939.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test in Sydney, with England captain Douglas Jardine again {{employed}} Bodyline. This involved constant intimidatory short-pitched leg-side bowling with a leg-cordon {{to catch}} balls fended {{off by the}} batsman, {{in an attempt to}} curtail Donald Bradman, generally regarded as the best batsman ever, from scoring. McCabe came to the wicket on the first day, the score at 3/82 with Bill Woodfull, Bill Ponsford and Jack Fingleton already dismissed, and Bradman not playing due to illness. Having warned his parents, who were watching him in Test cricket for the only time, not to jump the fence if he was hit, McCabe took guard. Jardine had deployed seven men on the leg-side, usually with five close catchers and two men patrolling the boundary for hook shots. McCabe hooked the first ball he received from Bodyline spearhead Harold Larwood for a boundary. After Kippax fell with the score at 87, McCabe and Vic Richardson added 129 before Richardson fell. McCabe reached stumps at 127 not out with the total 6/290. His innings was marked by dangerous cutting and compulsive hooking of short-pitched deliveries <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> unfazed by the repeated body blows which hit his teammates.|$|E
25|$|Mrs. Connally {{testified that}} just after hearing a loud, {{frightening}} noise {{that came from}} somewhere behind her and to her right, she turned toward President Kennedy and saw him raise his arms and elbows, with his hands <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and throat. She then heard another gunshot and then Governor Connally yelling. Mrs. Connally then turned away from Kennedy toward her husband, at which point another gunshot sounded and she and the limousine's rear interior were covered with fragments of skull, blood, and brain.|$|E

25|$|According to the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations, Kennedy {{was waving}} to the crowds {{on his right}} with his right arm upraised {{on the side of}} the limo when a shot entered his upper back, {{penetrated}} his neck and slightly damaged a spinal vertebra and the top of his right lung. The bullet exited his throat nearly centerline just beneath his larynx and nicked the left side of his suit tie knot. He raised his elbows and clenched his fists <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and neck, then leaned forward and left. Mrs. Kennedy, facing him, then put her arms around him in concern.|$|E
500|$|The first single, [...] "Stinkfist", {{garnered}} limited airplay. It was shortened {{by radio}} programmers, MTV (U.S.) renamed the music video of [...] "Stinkfist" [...] to [...] "Track No.1" [...] due to offensive connotations, and {{the lyrics of}} the song were altered. Responding to fan complaints about censorship, Matt Pinfield of MTV's 120 Minutes expressed regret on air by waving his fist <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> while introducing the video and explaining the name change.|$|E

500|$|After 1994, Armstrong refused all {{requests}} for autographs because {{he found that}} his signed items were selling for {{large amounts of money}} and that many forgeries were in circulation; any requests that were sent to him received a form letter in reply, saying that he had stopped signing. Although his no-autograph policy was well known, author Andrew Smith observed people at the 2002 Reno Air Races still trying to get signatures, with one person even claiming, [...] "If you shove something close enough <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> he'll sign." [...] He also stopped sending out congratulatory letters to new Eagle Scouts, because he believed these letters should come from people who know the Scouts personally.|$|E
500|$|Unlike 9413, other extras {{around him}} begin to find success. A woman (Adriane Marsh) {{with the number}} [...] "13" [...] on her head {{constantly}} kneels and stands back up {{at the behest of}} a film director, and eventually succeeds in landing a part, greeted by a [...] "Casting Today" [...] sign. Another extra (Voya George) with the number [...] "15", who unlike 9413 has expressionless and unenthusiastic facial expressions, holds paper masks <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> symbolizing his performances. He is greeted with enthusiasm by the cheering masses, all of whom speak in the same gibberish as 9413. His number 15 is replaced with a star and he achieves tremendous success. 9413 admires this new movie star and attempts to mimic him, presenting his own, much more impressive-looking mask. But the star is unimpressed and disregards 9413, who sadly cradles his mask like a baby, lamenting his inability to achieve success.|$|E

2500|$|When {{being interviewed}} by WCBS-NY, Espada {{walked out of}} the taping of the show [...] "Eye on New York" [...] on April 24, 2010, after {{reporter}} Marcia Kramer revisited issues of his actual residence. Espada got testy when Kramer reminded him that when she approached him last year outside his Mamaroneck home, he donned an orange ski cap and held a baby <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> to hide from the camera before speeding off in a car driven by his wife Connie Espada.|$|E
2500|$|The golden {{trevally}} is found {{either as a}} solitary individual or in small schools as an adult. Juveniles tend to form larger schools which tend to congregate and follow ( [...] or [...] "pilot") larger fish such as groupers, sharks, and even jellyfish. This behaviour mimics that of the related pilot fish, Naucrates ductor, with their maneuverability protecting them from their hosts, which in turn provides them with protection from predation from other fish. This behaviour extends to scuba divers, with one diver reporting a single young individual obsessively stationing itself <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> plate.|$|E

2500|$|The {{album is}} Q-Tip's second {{released}} studio effort, following his solo debut Amplified and the 2002 shelving of Kamaal/The Abstract. Q-Tip {{put together a}} band for recording The Renaissance. In an interview for Billboard magazine, he discussed his musical direction for the album, stating [...] "I wanted a hip-hop sonic feel, something pure {{to the sound of}} hip-hop with real drums, real emotion and people taking solos… In that sense this record feels like we're moving in a new direction … something hip-hop should do". Production for The Renaissance was primarily handled by Q-Tip, {{with the exception of the}} J Dilla-produced [...] "Move." [...] The album also features contributions from such artists as Norah Jones, D'Angelo, Raphael Saadiq and Amanda Diva. The album cover art features Q-Tip in a silver suit holding an MPC2000XL <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Department of the Environment {{report on}} the {{collision}} was published on 4 March 1976 and tests showed no equipment fault on the train. Postmortem evidence indicated that, {{at the time of}} impact, the driver's hand was on the [...] "dead man's handle", rather than <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> to protect it, implying he had made no attempt to stop. Witnesses were interviewed; some passengers on the train reporting that the train accelerated when entering the station, and some witnesses standing in the station reported that the driver, 56-year-old Leslie Newson, was sitting upright in his seat and looking straight ahead as the train passed through the station. The state of the motor-control gear, as found after the accident, indicated that power had been applied to the motors until within two seconds of the impact.|$|E
2500|$|A blatant bigot, McReynolds {{would not}} accept [...] "Jews, drinkers, blacks, women, smokers, married or engaged individuals" [...] as law clerks. Time [...] "called him 'Puritanical', 'intolerably rude', 'savagely sarcastic', 'incredibly reactionary', and 'anti-Semitic'". McReynolds refused to speak to Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish member of the Court, for three years {{following}} Brandeis's appointment and, when Brandeis retired in 1939, did not sign the customary dedicatory letter sent to justices on their retirement. He habitually left the conference room whenever Brandeis spoke. When Benjamin Cardozo's appointment was being pressed on President Herbert C. Hoover, McReynolds joined with fellow justices Pierce Butler and Willis Van Devanter in urging the White House not to [...] "afflict the Court with another Jew". When news of Cardozo's appointment was announced, McReynolds is claimed to have said [...] "Huh, {{it seems that the}} only way you can get on the Supreme Court these days is to be either the son of a criminal or a Jew, or both." [...] During Cardozo's swearing-in ceremony, McReynolds pointedly read a newspaper, and would often hold a brief or record <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> when Cardozo delivered an opinion from the bench. Likewise, he refused to sign opinions authored by Brandeis.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{theory is}} that Joan is {{actually}} a comic figure, and the huge alterations in her character are supposed to evoke laughter. Michael Taylor, for example, argues, [...] "A fiendish provenance replaces a divine one in , a scene that reduces Joan to a comic, bathetic dependency on shifty representatives of the underworld." [...] In line with this thinking, it is worth pointing {{out that in the}} 1981 BBC Television Shakespeare adaptation, Joan, and the French in general, are treated predominantly as comic figures. Joan (Brenda Blethyn), Alençon (Michael Byrne), the Bastard (Brian Protheroe), Reignier (David Daker) and Charles (Ian Saynor) are treated as buffoons for the most part, and there is no indication of any malevolence (significantly, when Joan’s fiends abandon her, we never see them, we simply see her talking to empty air). Examples of the comic treatment of the characters are found during the battle of Orléans, where Joan is ludicrously depicted as defending the city from the entire English army single-handed, whilst Talbot stands by incredulously watching his soldiers flee one after another. Another example appears in Act 2, Scene 1, as the five of them blame one another for the breach in the watch at Orléans that allowed the English back into the city. Their role as comic figures is also shown in Act 3, Scene 2. After Joan has entered Rouen and the others stand outside waiting for her signal. Charles is shown sneaking through a field holding a helmet with a large plume up <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> in an effort to hide.|$|E
2500|$|According to witnesses, the {{shooting}} occurred {{shortly after the}} limousine made the sharp left-hand turn from Houston onto Elm Street. Most of the witnesses recalled that the first shot was fired after the president had started waving with his right hand. The onlookers recalled hearing three shots, with {{the second and third}} shots bunched distinctly much closer together than the first and second shots. [...] The Zapruder film shows the President re-emerging in the footage after being temporarily hidden from view by the Stemmons Freeway sign at Zapruder film frame 224 to 225; his mouth has already opened wide in an anguished expression. He has already been impacted by a bullet and his hands clench into fists. He then quickly raises his fists dramatically <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> and throat as he turns leftwards towards his wife. Secret Service Agent Clint Hill testified that he heard one shot, then jumped off the running board of the Secret Service follow-up car directly behind Kennedy (Hill was filmed jumping off his follow-up car at the equivalent of Zapruder frame 308; {{about a quarter of a}} second before the president's head exploded at frame 313). Hill then rapidly ran towards the Presidential limo and then another shot hit Kennedy in the head, cracking open the right side of his skull. As the limousine began speeding up, Mrs. Kennedy was heard to scream [...] and she climbed out of the back seat onto the rear of the limo. [...] At the same time, Hill managed to climb aboard and hang onto the suddenly accelerating limo, and Mrs. Kennedy returned to the back seat. Hill then shielded her and the President. Both of the Connallys stated they heard Mrs. Kennedy say, [...] "I have his brains in my hand!" [...] The limo driver and police motorcycles turned on their sirens and raced at high speeds to Parkland Hospital, passing their intended destination of the Dallas Trade Mart along the way, and arriving at about 12:38p.m. (CST).|$|E
