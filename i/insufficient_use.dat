50|$|If {{firewood}} {{and timber}} is collected from grassland {{rather than from}} forests, human land use will even benefit the species. In particular, sal (Shorea robusta) and saj (Terminalia elliptica) {{have been identified as}} trees that encroach upon the florican's habitat in Nepal, and its decline in Bardia National Park is probably chiefly due to <b>insufficient</b> <b>use</b> of trees that overgrow grassland. A sustainable land-management technique that will bolster Bengal florican stocks consists of harvesting grass and particularly wood from changing tracts of land, leaving some areas unharvested each year and setting aside a few additional ones as reserve land, where grasses can grow tall for years until they are harvested. Controlled burning may be necessary when woodland encroachment is strong; it should take place before March, so that the year's offspring are not harmed.A landscape ecology approach, integrating social, biological and physical environmental elements at scales compatible with management objectives, will be needed to effectively conserve Bengal floricans and their grassland habitats.|$|E

Federated Farmers was consulted on the proposal and agreed that there was <b>insufficient</b> <b>use</b> {{of the station}} to justify its retention.

Aberrant activation of β-catenin is oncogenic and is a critical driver in the development and progression of human cancers.

MSAB shows potent anti-tumor effects selectively on Wnt-dependent cancer cells in vitro and in mouse cancer models.

A commitment to a long-run money growth rate corresponding to the inflation target could reinforce the credibility of central bank announcements and the role of inflation target as strong and credible nominal anchor for private inflation expectations. We show that, using Friedman’s k-percent money growth rule to help anchoring inflation expectations under inflation-targeting regime can generate dynamic instability in output, inflation, assets prices as well as real money demand. Alternatively, a well-specified monetary targeting rule that responds negatively to the evolution of expected inflation allows achieving macro-economic and financial stability. inflation targeting, monetary targeting, stock prices, macro-economic and financial stability, Friedman’s k-percent money growth rule. ...|$|R

To prune the superfluous genes and samples we used a feature selection method called Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), which is supposed to enhance the output of classification and avoid the local optimization problem. We examined the classification prediction accuracy of the TSVM-RFE algorithm in comparison with the Genetic Learning Across Datasets (GLAD) algorithm, as both are semi-supervised learning methods. Comparing these two methods, we found that the TSVM-RFE surpassed both a SVM using RFE and GLAD. I...|$|R
