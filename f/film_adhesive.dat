On or before graduating in 1927, {{in some form}} of debauchery, he climbed the side of the Great Gate to place a broken furniture leg in Henry VIII's right hand. Henry VIII Holding Stick He became a Fellow at Trinity in 1928 to research atomic physics under Rutherford at the Cavendish Laboratory. In 1928 de Bruyne published his findings in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. He also wrote up his research as a thesis for the Trinity Fellowship and in September 1928 was duly elected a Prize Fellow of Trinity College. De Bruyne took his MA and PhD degrees in 1930. He continued to work at the Cavendish until 1931.Dr. de Bruyne developed other [...] "plastics". A laminate of flax roving and paper soaked with liquid phenolic resin and cured under pressure was called Gordon Aerolite. This type of reinforcement was suggested by Mr. Malcolm Gordon {{as a result of the}} publication of Dr. de Bruyne's lecture to the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1937. Malcolm Gordon was a student of Dr. de Bruyne, and Gordon's family had connections to a Belfast linen business which supplied de Bruyne with flax after he had been rejected by an American glassfibre manufacturer; The reply to his enquiry, in January 1937, for glass [...] "silk" [...] went as follows: [...] " [...] [...] [...] I have to say that we see no prospect of glass 'silk' being suitable for molded plastics [...] [...] [...] Our reluctance to supply it for any purpose where it is possibly going to be a failure [...] [...] [...]" [...] as they did not see [...] "any prospect for glass 'silk' being suitable for molded plastics" [...] and did not want to be associated with potential failure. Dr. de Bruyne's Aero Research company continued to expand. The company made Miles Magister tailplanes for the Air Ministry. During this time, de Havilland's chief engineer began spending time at Aero Research discussing the concept of wood sandwich construction with balsa core. This eventually led to the production of the Mosquito bomber. As war broke out, the company began to grow and developed the strip heating process to speed the assembly of wood parts. Morris Motors used Aerolite and strip heating to assembly Horsa gliders, as did de Havilland on the Mosquito as well as on other aircraft and in naval launches and patrol boats. Other adhesives were developed, Redux (for REsearch at DUXford - de Bruyne with George Newell) was developed to box aluminium sheet to a balsa core. Fomvar was an early <b>film</b> <b>adhesive.</b> Aerodux was a resorcinol which to this day remains one of the company's most popular glues. At the end of the war, the company's first efforts to market their products was to the Finnish Plywood Association who ordered 100 tons of Aerolite. This order was a turning point for Aero Research, which spent the next five years working on a plan and financing for truly large-scale low-cost production of urea-formaldehyde resins. In the end, Aero Research was taken over by the Swiss Ciba company, a large multinational group of chemical companies that wanted to expand into England.|$|E

40|$|Adhesive bonding and bonded {{repair of}} {{metallic}} and composite aircraft structures {{have been used}} as effective methods for manufacturing and for restoring structural integrity of aircraft structures. Adhesive bonding requires the application of heat in order to cure the adhesive and complete the bonding operation; however, conventional heating methods are subject to several drawbacks and might be undesirable, particularly in cases involving repair of new, exotic aerospace materials. The motivation of this work is to develop a novel, cost-effective bonding method and apparatus using a network of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to provide heating with uniform bondline temperature, rapid temperature response, and minimal energy cost by producing heat directly at the bondline.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted in order to characterize {{the sensitivity of the}} overall response and failure behavior of composite scarf joints to the details of their geometry. Three parameters, considered to be manufacturing imperfections that could occur during the repair process, are examined: a through-thickness offset between the two adherends, adherends of different relative thicknesses, and adherends with different relative longitudinal stiffnesses. In all cases, the baseline adherend remains the same with a [Â± 15] 3 s layup, and the manufacturing imperfection is introduced in the opposite adherend. A specimen was designed and utilized for this study. All specimens were made from Toray T 800 / 3900 pre-impregnated carbon fiber/epoxy composite material and 3 M Scotch-Weld Structural Adhesive Film AF 555 M using controlled processing techniques, some of which were specifically designed to handle the particular details of this work. The achieved geometry of all specimens for each case show successful implementation of the manufacturing imperfections. All specimens were tested in uniaxial tension to failure and the results indicate that the specimens show the desired behavior throughout. The load-displacement responses of all specimens exhibit the same general characteristics, with an initial linear region that gradually transitions to increasingly nonlinear behavior to the point of maximum load. The extensional stress-strain responses for all adherends are linear to the point of maximum load, with moduli equal to those calculated via Classical Laminate Plate Theory. The load-bending strain responses exhibit minimal magnitude of bending for cases with aligned load paths through both adherends, while the specimens with an eccentric load path between the two adherends show bending strain that increases with increasing load, showing membrane stiffening effects at higher loads. The type of failure and location of the failure surfaces throughout the joint region is generally the same for all specimens, with cohesive failure {{directly in front of the}} blunt tip of both adherends, crossing via adhesive failure from the corner of the blunt tip to the opposite adherend surface, where cohesive failure occurs until it crosses back via adhesive failure near the midline of the joint to join antisymmetrically with the failure surface from the opposite blunt tip. The value of the maximum loads of the specimens fall into two sets based on the achieved thickness of the <b>film</b> <b>adhesive</b> layer of the specimen: either less than or greater than the nominal uncured <b>film</b> <b>adhesive</b> thickness. However, the type and magnitude of the manufacturing imperfections considered showed no effect on these maximum loads. Voids are observed within the <b>film</b> <b>adhesive</b> layer of all specimens, with differences in the shapes, sizes, and extents of the voids corresponding with the thickness of the <b>film</b> <b>adhesive</b> layer and likely contributing to the maximum loads observed.
