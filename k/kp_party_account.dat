The communication theories gatekeeping and agenda setting are applied to the first two research questions: How do official Twitter <b>accounts</b> of political <b>parties</b> differ from party-leader accounts when it comes to (1 a) frequency and dispersion of tweets, (1 b) agenda setting? How does different parties’ communication diverge regarding (2 a) frequency and dispersion, (2 b) agenda setting? Finally, Political personalization theory is applied to the third research question: (3) To what extent are party leaders utilized in party communication on Twitter?        There are 655 identified tweets during Almedalen 2017.

Opposition parties are more active on Twitter than governing parties.

50|$|In computing, {{a master}} data {{management}} tool {{can be used to}} support {{master data management}} by removing duplicates, standardizing data (mass maintaining), and incorporating rules to eliminate incorrect data from entering the system in order to create an authoritative source of master data. Master data are the products, <b>accounts</b> and <b>parties</b> for which the business transactions are completed. The root cause problem stems from business unit and product line segmentation, in which the same customer will be serviced by different product lines, with redundant data being entered about the customer (a.k.a. party in the role of customer) and account in order to process the transaction. The redundancy of <b>party</b> and <b>account</b> data is compounded in the front to back office life cycle, where the authoritative single source for the <b>party,</b> <b>account</b> and product data is needed but is often once again redundantly entered or augmented.|$|R
