We show that the apparent trends in global mean brightness temperature due to the change <b>in</b> <b>weighting</b> function vary from about - 0. 4 K/decade to 0. 4 K/decade depending on the altitude sensed by the different SSU channels.

40|$|Background There is an {{increased}} interest {{in the use of}} multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to support regulatory and reimbursement decision making. The EVIDEM framework was developed to provide pragmatic multi-criteria decision support in health care, to estimate the value of healthcare interventions, and to aid in priority-setting. The objectives of this study were to test 1) the influence of different weighting techniques on the overall outcome of an MCDA exercise, 2) the discriminative power <b>in</b> <b>weighting</b> different criteria of such techniques, and 3) whether different techniques result <b>in</b> similar <b>weights</b> <b>in</b> <b>weighting</b> the criteria set proposed by the EVIDEM framework. Methods A sample of 60 Dutch and Canadian students participated in the study. Each student used an online survey to provide weights for 14 criteria with two different techniques: a five-point rating scale and one of the following techniques selected randomly: ranking, point allocation, pairwise comparison and best worst scaling. Results The results {{of this study indicate that}} there is no effect of differences <b>in</b> <b>weights</b> on value estimates at the group level. On an individual level, considerable differences <b>in</b> criteria <b>weights</b> and rank order occur as a result of the weight elicitation method used, and the ability of different techniques to discriminate in criteria importance. Of the five techniques tested, the pair-wise comparison of criteria has the highest ability to discriminate <b>in</b> <b>weights</b> when fourteen criteria are compared. Conclusions When weights are intended to support group decisions, the choice of elicitation technique has negligible impact on criteria weights and the overall value of an innovation. However, when weights are used to support individual decisions, the choice of elicitation technique influences outcome and studies that use dissimilar techniques cannot be easily compared. Weight elicitation through pairwise comparison of criteria is preferred when taking into account its superior ability to discriminate between criteria and respondents’ preference...|$|R
