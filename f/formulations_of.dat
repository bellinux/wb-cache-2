5|$|Dualism {{is a set}} {{of views}} about the {{relationship}} between mind and matter (or body). It begins with the claim that mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical. One of the earliest known <b>formulations</b> <b>of</b> mind–body dualism was expressed in the eastern Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy (c. 650 BCE), which divided the world into purusha (mind/spirit) and prakriti (material substance). Specifically, the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali presents an analytical approach {{to the nature of the}} mind.|$|E

Research Objectives 1. to identify and analyze the policy on <b>formulation</b> <b>of</b> protection of rights of accused terrorists in the line with the principle of presumption of innocence in criminal judicial system. 2. To identify and analyze the policy on <b>formulation</b> <b>of</b> procedures of treating accused terrorists in the line with the principle of presumption of innocence in criminal judicial system. It was a juridicial normative research with qualitative analysis. Research Finding : The <b>formulation</b> <b>of</b> protection of rights of accused terrorists is normatifvely provided in the Criminal Codes and Law of Terrorism Combat. The policy on <b>formulation</b> <b>of</b> protection of the rights of accused terrorists in those two laws is not yet fully harmonious since in the Law of Terrorism Combat there is a provision inconsistent with the principles of proof provided in the Criminal Codes. However, the rest is in general in coherence with the principle of presumption of innocence. The policy on <b>formulation</b> <b>of</b> procedures of treating accused terrorists is already consistent with the principle of protection to the rights of accused terrorists in compliance the Criminal Codes and Law of Terrorism Combat. The policy on <b>formulation</b> <b>of</b> procedures of treating accused terrorists is normatively consistent with the principle of presumption of innocence. However, in their implementations, there were still technical obstacles due to some diffrent perceptions in understanding the provisions concerning with treatment to accused terrorists by the legal enforcers...|$|R

5|$|Aspirin is an {{effective}} analgesic for acute pain, but is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen for the alleviation of pain because aspirin {{is more likely to}} cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps, bloating, gastric distension, or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent <b>formulations</b> <b>of</b> aspirin, such as Alka-Seltzer or Blowfish, relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets, which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines. Topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain.|$|E

Common <b>formulations</b> <b>of</b> the clique problem include finding a maximum clique (a clique with the largest possible number of vertices), finding a maximum weight clique in a weighted graph, listing all maximal cliques (cliques that cannot be enlarged), and solving the decision problem of testing whether a graph contains a clique larger than a given size.|$|E

5|$|Chemical peels {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the {{appearance}} of acne scars. Mild peels include those using glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, Jessner's solution, or a lower concentrations (20%) of trichloroacetic acid. These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne. Higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (30–40%) are considered to be medium-strength peels and affect skin as deep as the papillary dermis. <b>Formulations</b> <b>of</b> trichloroacetic acid concentrated to 50% or more are considered to be deep chemical peels. Medium-strength and deep-strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars, but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes, infection, and small white superficial cysts known as milia.|$|E

5|$|In Japan, a geisha {{was paid}} {{for the number of}} senkodokei (incense sticks) that had been {{consumed}} while she was present, a practice which continued until 1924. Incense seal clocks were used for similar occasions and events as the stick clock; while religious purposes were of primary importance, these clocks were also popular at social gatherings, and were used by Chinese scholars and intellectuals. The seal was a wooden or stone disk with one or more grooves etched in it into which incense was placed. These clocks were common in China, but were produced in fewer numbers in Japan. To signal the passage of a specific amount of time, small pieces of fragrant woods, resins, or different scented incenses could be placed on the incense powder trails. Different powdered incense clocks used different <b>formulations</b> <b>of</b> incense, depending on how the clock was laid out. The length of the trail of incense, directly related {{to the size of the}} seal, was the primary factor in determining how long the clock would last; all burned for long periods of time, ranging between 12 hours and a month.|$|E
5|$|The {{significance}} {{of the concept of}} a Hilbert space was underlined with the realization that it offers one of the best mathematical <b>formulations</b> <b>of</b> quantum mechanics. In short, the states of a quantum mechanical system are vectors in a certain Hilbert space, the observables are hermitian operators on that space, the symmetries of the system are unitary operators, and measurements are orthogonal projections. The relation between quantum mechanical symmetries and unitary operators provided an impetus {{for the development of the}} unitary representation theory of groups, initiated in the 1928 work of Hermann Weyl. On the other hand, in the early 1930s it became clear that classical mechanics can be described in terms of Hilbert space (Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics) and that certain properties of classical dynamical systems can be analyzed using Hilbert space techniques in the framework of ergodic theory.|$|E
