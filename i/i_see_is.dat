The singer professes his love: [...] "I look around and everything <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> beautiful, because all <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> you." [...] According to The Huffington Posts Dean, Timberlake is in happier state of mind than on his 2002 song [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] or his 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around". However, his lyrics have an obsessive quality: [...] "A million people in a crowded room, but my camera lens is only set to zoom and it all becomes so clear." [...] Mellisa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly wrote that on [...] "Tunnel Vision", Timberlake is lyrically [...] "playing the rom-com director": [...] "Just like a movie shoot, I’m zoomin’ in on you as we ride off into the sun." [...] According to Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times, Timberlake uses references to [...] "cameras and reflective surfaces" [...] {{to reflect on the}} [...] "changing nature of celebrity".|$|E

Robert Christgau of MSN Music stated that West perfectly acknowledged {{his status as a}} rapper, and noted that his persona seems to be aware that his [...] "bling-and-sex brag is about to get blown away by padrone Jay-Z's 'all <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> these niggaz I made millionaires/Millin about' and pink-haired Nicki Minaj's 'bitch from Sri Lanka-Willy Wonka-watch the queen conquer' trifecta." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters praised the production of the song, and stated that the track features [...] "glass-shattering bass". Nitsuh Abebe of New York declared that Minaj gave one of the best verses of the year.|$|E
500|$|... "Beautiful People" [...] is an uptempo electro house, dancehall and Europop {{song with}} R influences. According to James Dean Wells from AOL Radio, {{the song is}} [...] " [...] pulsing synths that build under Benassi and Brown's staccato and auto-tuned melodies." [...] "Beautiful People" [...] is set in common time with a {{moderate}} tempo of 126 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of Eb major with Brown's vocal range spanning from the note of Eb4 to the note of F5. The song is positive and uplifting with lyrics such as: [...] "Everywhere that I've been / The only thing that <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> beautiful people ... / Don't you know / Don't you know / You're beautiful." [...] According to Rap-Up, on the song, Brown encourages [...] "everyone {{on the dance floor}} to keep their heads up and discover the beauty inside." [...] When speaking about [...] "Beautiful People", Brown told Jayson Rodriguez from MTV News that [...] "it wasn't a selfish record, it wasn't me bragging or boasting or talking about cars or money or girls. It was me being able to inspire people with dance music. We have a lot of tragic things going on and the world needs to come together as a whole and stop the negativity." ...|$|E

2500|$|A free {{relative}} clause, on {{the other}} hand, {{does not have an}} explicit antecedent external to itself. Instead, the relative clause itself takes the place of an argument in the matrix clause.

[...] Commenting in Unrestrained magazine in 2007, Rygg said, [...] "I'm a diagnosed depressive, {{and should have}} been trying to focus on living, but instead I've immersed myself in some isolated, dark and paranoid place. It has no doubt helped make this album what it is, but it's a prison of the mind." [...] Adding, “Sometimes all <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> darkness; it's overpowering. So this record is about venting out a lot of that stuff, the gloom, but it also represents some kind of quiet acceptance. Like this is how the situation is, and you're just gonna have to live with it. Use it for what it's worth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Springfield {{introduced}} the Motown sound {{to a wider}} UK audience, both with her covers of Motown songs, and by facilitating the first UK TV appearance for The Temptations, The Supremes, The Miracles, and Stevie Wonder on {{a special edition of}} the Ready Steady Go! show – which was produced by Wickham – called The Sound of Motown. On 28 April 1965 it was broadcast by Rediffusion TV, with Springfield opening each half of the show accompanied by Martha Reeves and the Vandellas and Motown's in-house band, The Funk Brothers. The associated Tamla-Motown Revue featuring The Supremes, The Miracles and Wonder had started in London in March, and according to The Supremes' Mary Wilson, the tour was a flop: [...] "It's always... disheartening when you go out there and you see the house is half-full... but once you're on stage... You perform as well for five as you do for 500." [...] Wickham, a fan of the Motown artists, booked them for the Ready Steady Go! special and enlisted Springfield to host it. In 1966 Springfield released three additional UK Top20 hits: [...] "Little By Little" [...] and two dramatic ballads – one written by Carole King: [...] "Goin' Back" [...] and [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>Is</b> You," [...] written by Ben Weisman & Clive Westlake, which also reached the US Top20. In August and September 1966, she hosted Dusty, a six-part music and talk show weekly BBC TV series. A compilation of her singles, Golden Hits released in November 1966, reached No.2 in the UK. From the mid-1960s, Springfield would use the pseudonym [...] "Gladys Thong" [...] when recording backing vocals for other artists including Madeline Bell, Kiki Dee, Anne Murray and Elton John. Bell was a regular backing singer on early Springfield albums, and the pair co-wrote [...] "I'm Gonna Leave You" [...] with Lesley Duncan, which appeared as the B-side of [...] "Goin' Back." ...|$|E
