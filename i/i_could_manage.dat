25|$|The Byzantine army's nadir {{was reached}} in 1091, when Alexios <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> to field only 500 {{soldiers}} from the Empire's professional forces. These formed {{the nucleus of the}} army, with the addition of the armed retainers of Alexios' relatives and the nobles enrolled in the army, plus the substantial aid of a large force of allied Cumans, which won the Battle of Levounion against the Pechenegs (Petcheneks or Patzinaks). Yet, through a combination of skill, determination, and years of campaigning, Alexios, John, and Manuel Komnenos managed to restore the power of the Byzantine Empire by constructing a new army from scratch. This process should not, however, at least in its earlier phases, be seen as a planned exercise in military restructuring. In particular, Alexios I was often reduced to reacting to events rather than controlling them; the changes he made to the Byzantine army were largely done out of immediate necessity and were pragmatic in nature.|$|E
2500|$|Delaney felt an {{immediate}} affinity with this [...] "multitude {{of people of}} all races – spending every night {{of their lives in}} parks and cafes" [...] surviving on next to nothing. Their courage and shared camaraderie inspired him to feel that [...] "somehow, someway there was something <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> if only with some stronger force of will I could find the courage to surmount the terror and fear of this immense city and accept everything insofar as possible with some calm and determination".|$|E
2500|$|Dodds {{reported}} that he asked God how he should play cricket, and received the reply: [...] "Hit the ball hard and enjoy it." [...] He took some while to follow this advice, but when he did, the Essex cricketer and coach Frank Rist noted a transformation in his batting which led him to dub Dodds [...] "the miracle man". Dodds himself dated his transformation to a match against Middlesex: [...] "I felt closer to God {{than ever before in}} my life," [...] he wrote. [...] "I tried to fashion the loveliest strokes <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> for the God who would enjoy them. In return I had a tremendous sense of His pleasure." ...|$|E
60|$|If I {{had looked}} back through all my old {{recollections}} of her, and had recalled {{them one by}} one, it would only have ended in making me cry. And yet, I felt that I ought {{to stand up for}} her as long as <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> <b>managed</b> to meet the difficulty in this way.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! that's a bore,' {{said his}} companion. 'It is {{difficult}} to turn to with a new thing when you {{are not in the}} habit of it. <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> charades.' ...|$|R
60|$|Jack. Well, I don't see how <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{possibly}} <b>manage</b> to do that. I {{can produce}} the hand-bag at any moment. It {{is in my}} dressing-room at home. I really think that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a very stiff sum," [...] {{the master}} of Tilgate retorted; [...] "but perhaps <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> it; per--haps <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> it. We must sell the Dowlands farm at once, that's certain, and I must take the twelve {{thousand}} or so the land will fetch for my own use, absolutely and without restriction." ...|$|E
60|$|Bessie. I think, {{if you let}} me, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> to {{talk him}} round in a week, maybe.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, five-and-twenty, or even twenty. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> on twenty. And then {{we could}} buy a {{commission}} for dear Ferdinand.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You {{will take}} me with you, Abu,' I exclaimed. 'This is the chance I have been hoping for. Once within a day's journey of Khartoum, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> slip away at night, {{and it would be}} very hard if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>manage</b> to cross the Nile into Khartoum.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{joined the}} fatal group once more. [...] "Do you know," [...] I said, {{addressing}} Lucretia {{with as little}} tremor in my voice as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>manage,</b> [...] "it's very curious, but I have never heard your surname yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was afraid}} of it after what Pete told me," [...] he said. [...] "I would have helped him more if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>managed</b> it, but I can't let a big crop like this stand over when I've bills to meet." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was my turn}} {{to stare}} dumbly before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> to ask: “For Tolosa?” in a very knowing tone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rather," [...] replied March. [...] "Don't {{you think}} it would be better for me to ride behind you? I think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> to hold on." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{asserted}} my Ego. 'Certainly,' I answered, with my coolest air. 'I said I thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> {{you for a}} week; and I {{have managed}} you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|With {{this object}} I {{purposely}} made a considerable circuit {{on my way}} to the Hall (as we called the Earl's house): [...] "and if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>manage</b> to lose my way a bit," [...] I thought to myself, [...] "that would suit me capitally!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't, Boardman," [...] pleaded Dan. [...] "Boardy, I {{believe if}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{get in and}} {{up to my room}} without anybody's seeing me, I'd let you tell them. There don't seem to be anybody about, and <b>I</b> think we <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't mind if I {{never got}} another new stitch, if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>manage</b> the other things," [...] said Mrs. Page stoutly. [...] "If your Uncle Eugene would only help us a little, until Leicester got through! He really ought to. But {{of course he}} never will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, mademoiselle, I think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> {{to escape}} if I had {{but a little}} help. For example, from the top window of this house I think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> to jump upon the wall, {{and if you could}} but furnish me with a rope I could easily make my escape. Of course I should want a suit of peasant’s clothes, for, you see, I should be {{detected}} at once if I tried to get away in this uniform. I speak French fairly now, and think I could pass as a native.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{told him}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> five hundred, {{and he said}} he could do the same, but I doubt whether that will be enough to carry it out properly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{none in the}} world," [...] said I, as {{carelessly}} as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> it; [...] "only I don't {{think it}} a legitimate--that is, an effective, method of attack." ...|$|E
60|$|I listened--and under similar {{circumstances}} I would listen again--yes! with my ear at the keyhole, if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not possibly <b>manage</b> {{it in any}} other way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} younger man reflectively, [...] "I always fancied you were a sportsman, and we had our fun. Of course, while it lasted I would cheerfully have broken the Socialist fellow's head if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>managed</b> it, but just now the odds seem a trifle heavy against him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Baxter, H. J., sergeant, RAF, air-gunner, {{shot down}} in a Sunderland over the sea, batman & cook, [...] "Baxter was the most unselfish and gallant man", [...] "always ready to help", [...] "having only one hand <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>manage</b> it (escaping down a rope) unaided, Sergeant Baxter used to let me down." ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, Mary, I {{think you}} might,' said Ethel, after a moment's thought. 'If it were only Aubrey, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> for him; but I am more anxious about papa.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish it was}} I," [...] said Jock, [...] "I'll {{be bound}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> it!" [...] Then impatiently—-"Something must be done, you know, Armie. We can't stay here all night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to a ball next week," [...] she explained, [...] "a grown-up ball, and I've got to wear a skirt. I {{wanted to see if}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> a train." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know. It was silly, officious blundering on {{the part}} of one of my subs. I meant de Mountford to {{have plenty of time to}} get away, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>managed</b> it somehow to leave him unmolested if he kept some {{distance}} away from England. The whole thing has been most unfortunate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Undreamed of!" [...] cried Mercedes, {{throwing}} {{up her hands}} in dainty dismay. [...] "However in the world <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>manage</b> without a tent?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well, then, I {{will give}} you two {{shilling}}s a day for food; that will be sixpence for breakfast and tea and a shilling for dinner. <b>I</b> suppose you <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> on that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> to be glad!' the Queen said. 'Only I {{never can}} {{remember}} the rule. You must be very happy, living in this wood, and being glad whenever you like!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand," [...] he said, [...] "it is {{etiquette}} for music-hall {{artists in}} their spare time to eat--er--fried fish with their fingers. Must I do that? I doubt if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I do, and I'll {{tell you}} how I mean to get it. I've planned everything; for, though I hardly dreamed of going, I amused myself by {{thinking}} how <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>manage</b> if I did get invited." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{great deal}} too much, master. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>managed</b> it <b>I</b> should have dropped the sword Silence on your toe long before. But I couldn't, for the Heer Adrian was {{watching}} me, and I {{had to wait}} till he closed his eyes, which he did to hear the better without seeming to listen." ...|$|R
6000|$|So the {{acquaintance}} became {{closer and}} closer, {{and at last}} Will ventured to say: “If I were back in England, mademoiselle, I might perhaps get your Lucien out. You could give me his name and the prison {{in which he is}} confined, and it would be hard if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>manage</b> to aid him to escape.” ...|$|R
60|$|You may {{imagine the}} shock to my {{feelings}} when I beheld his white head. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>manage</b> {{to tell him}} that his wife was at an hotel in town. He left me at once, to go and get his hat on board. I was mightily surprised by the smartness of his movements as he hurried up the gangway.|$|R
