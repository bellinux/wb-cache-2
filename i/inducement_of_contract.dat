50|$|The {{principal}} torts can {{be listed}} as passing off, injurious falsehood and trade libel (see also Food libel laws), conspiracy, <b>inducement</b> <b>of</b> breach <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> tortious interference (such as interference with economic relations or unlawful interference with trade), and watching and besetting. These torts represent the common law's historical attempt {{to balance the}} need to protect claimants against those who inflict economic harm and the wider need to allow effective, even aggressive, competition (including competition between employers and their workers).|$|R
2500|$|MacMahon {{found their}} {{arguments}} [...] "wholly unconvincing." [...] There {{was no evidence}} of fraud in the <b>inducement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contract,</b> and even if there had been the Prima Paint separability rule required that the arbitrator decide that question unless the fraud claim was specific to the arbitration clause itself, which was not the case in the McMahons' suit. Fraud was also well within the scope of the arbitration clause, he wrote. Nor did the state action waive the arbitration clause since it largely concerned different issues and [...] "that proceeding has no bearing on this action and certainly no effect on plaintiffs' agreement to arbitrate".|$|R
2500|$|There is no {{consensus}} {{about the status of}} the right to strike at common law. On the one hand, the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed that [...] "to cease work except for higher wages, and a strike in consequence, was lawful at common law", that [...] "right of workmen to strike is an essential element in the principle of collective bargaining", [...] "that workmen have a right to strike", and that this is [...] "a fundamental human right". This view would accord with international law, and see the right to stop work in a good faith trade dispute as an implied term in every employment contract. On the other hand, differently composed courts have asserted that the common law position sits at odds with international law: that a strike is a breach <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> and this creates tortious liability for unions organising collective action, unless it falls within an immunity from statute. On this view, even though an employer is not liable for economic loss to workers who are collectively dismissed, a union could be liable to the employer for taking collective action. Economic torts have been said to include conspiracy to injure, <b>inducement</b> <b>of</b> breach <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> and tortious interference with a contract. However, TULRCA 1992 section 219 contains the classic formula, that collective action by a trade union becomes immune from any liability in tort if done [...] "in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute". This said, various further hurdles must be jumped for a union to be certain of immunity from employers suing for damages, or an injunction to stop a strike.|$|R
5000|$|Tortious {{interference}} with contract rights can occur when one party convinces another to breach its {{contract with a}} third party (e.g., using blackmail, threats, influence, etc.) or where someone knowingly interferes with a contractor's ability to perform his contractual obligations, preventing the client from receiving the services or goods promised (e.g., by refusing to deliver goods).

30|$|Knots {{have been}} {{considered}} an undesirable visual feature of lumber. To clarify the essence of this visual undesirability, eye-tracking data from 20 subjects, who freely observed 55 images of wood wall panels, were recorded and distribution maps of eye-fixation pauses were composed. These maps were compared with the arrangement of knots on each knotty wall panel image and the visual <b>inducement</b> <b>of</b> knots was evaluated using a new numerical index of pausing probability. The present study {{is the first to}} objectively quantify the visual <b>inducement</b> <b>of</b> knots. In addition, the subjective noticeability of knots and ten visual impressions of each wood panel image were investigated by a sensory evaluation. There was a very clear linear relationship between the visual <b>inducement</b> <b>of</b> knots and the subjective noticeability of knots. A correlation analysis suggested that many visual impressions of wood wall panels were influenced by a complementary effect between the subjective noticeability of knots and the visual <b>inducement</b> <b>of</b> knots. The visual impact of knots was masked to some extent by special visual stimuli such as deep red grooves on the wood wall panels.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was the <b>inducement</b> <b>of</b> imagery in order to retain sign {{language}} vocabulary items. Thirty-eight beginning sign language students were selected as subjects. Subjects were randomly assigned to two groups. The treatment group received instructions in the use of imagery mnemonics in order to better retain sign language vocabulary. Subjects in the control group were left to learn the vocabulary items by methods of their own choosing. Results of the statistical analyses indicated no significant difference between groups on posttest measures. However, there was a tendency toward an interaction between subjects' grade point averages and the treatments. The <b>inducement</b> <b>of</b> imagery in the treatment group was somewhat of an "equalizer" between subjects with high and low grade point averages. Additional analyses indicated that the <b>inducement</b> <b>of</b> imagery mnemonics in the treatment group was more successful for the poorer students and hindered the better students...|$|R

40|$|In June, 2005, the United States Supreme Court {{set forth}} an 2 ̆ 2 {{inducement}} 2 ̆ 2 rule in MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. that imposes secondary liability on 2 ̆ 2 one who distributes a device with {{the object of}} promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement. 2 ̆ 2 The Court emphasized {{the limitations of the}} liability standard it was setting forth, stating that the target was only 2 ̆ 2 purposeful, culpable expression and conduct, and thus does nothing to compromise legitimate commerce or discourage innovation having a lawful promise. 2 ̆ 2 Yet, the liability standard set forth in Grokster is not as clear or as precise as the Court 2 ̆ 7 s opinion suggested. Moreover, it has potential implications for the scope of secondary liability under the Patent Act as well. The Copyright Act contains no statutory language referring to 2 ̆ 2 inducement to infringe, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 contributory infringement, 2 ̆ 2 or any other type of secondary or vicarious liability. Rather, the courts have exported these theories of indirect liability from the Patent Act, where they are explicit, and have read them into copyright law. Thus, the Grokster Court drew its liability standard for <b>inducement</b> <b>of</b> copyright infringement from the <b>inducement</b> <b>of</b> infringement liability provision of the Patent Act. It {{is not surprising that the}} Court did so [...] the relationship between the law relating to copyright infringement and patent infringement has been closely intertwined for many decades, and the Supreme Court itself has drawn upon the intricate relationship between the two areas in crafting its copyright jurisprudence, both in Grokster and in earlier cases. Unfortunately, however, the contours <b>of</b> liability for <b>inducement</b> <b>of</b> infringement under the Patent Act have been unclear historically. The decisions of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have spawned two competing lines of cases: one imposing a broader scope <b>of</b> liability for <b>inducement</b> to infringe because of a weaker intent standard, and one imposing a narrower scope of liability because of a stronger intent standard. The Supreme Court ignored this intra-circuit split in Grokster, leaving unsettled both the parameters of indirect infringement liability in copyright law and the impact that Grokster is likely to have on the development <b>of</b> <b>inducement</b> <b>of</b> infringement jurisprudence under patent law. Thus, two critical aspects of Grokster are its potential impact on the development of indirect liability under both copyright and patent law and, most importantly, its potential influence on our understanding of the 2 ̆ 2 intent 2 ̆ 2 element <b>of</b> <b>inducement</b> <b>of</b> infringement in both areas. As discussed below, inducement liability first evolved in the patent context through case law. It was codified in the Patent Act and imported into copyright law by the courts, even though no statutory basis for such liability exists in that context. Then, in Grokster, the Supreme Court expounded upon the meaning <b>of</b> intent for <b>inducement</b> <b>of</b> infringement in the copyright area. That language has since been adopted by the Federal Circuit in analyzing the intent standard for inducement in the patent area. It is worth exploring whether these incremental judicial alterations in what is fundamentally a statutory area of patent law intrude upon the proper relationship between the courts and the legislature, and whether these changes result in rational or piecemeal development of the legal standards pertaining to <b>inducement</b> <b>of</b> infringement liability in patent law...|$|R
