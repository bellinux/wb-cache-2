5|$|In the 16th century, the Marsamxett Harbour {{was one of}} the {{two major}} {{harbours}} in the Maltese city of Valletta. In the centre of the harbour was an island, originally known as l'Isolotto and now known as Manoel Island after the fort, which overlooked the city. Shortly after Valletta's construction, the Order of Saint John realised this was a potential vulnerability in the city's defences. As early as 1569, it was proposed that a small fort with a cavalier be built on the Isolotto to prevent the enemy <b>from</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> island and building batteries on it. The threat was again highlighted by the Spanish military engineer Scipione Campi in 1577, and by Giovanni Battista in 1582.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{was not entirely}} bad news for Vienna. At Haslach, Johann von Klenau arranged his 25,000infantry and cavalry in a prime defensive position and, on 11 October, the overly confident General of Division Pierre Dupont de l'Étang attacked Klenau's force with fewer than 8,000men. The French lost 1,500men killed and wounded. Aside <b>from</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> Imperial Eagles and guidons of the 15th and 17th Dragoons, Klenau's force also captured 900men, 11guns and 18 ammunition wagons.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to visit Jupiter was Pioneer 10 in 1973, followed {{a year later}} by Pioneer11. Aside <b>from</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> first close-up pictures of the planet, the probes discovered its magnetosphere and its largely fluid interior. The Voyager1 and Voyager2 probes visited the planet in 1979, and studied its moons and the ring system, discovering the volcanic activity ofIo {{and the presence of}} water ice on the surface of Europa. Ulysses further studied Jupiter's magnetosphere in 1992 and then again in 2000. The Cassini probe approached the planet in 2000 and took very detailed images of its atmosphere. The New Horizons spacecraft passed by Jupiter in 2007 and made improved measurements of its and its satellites' parameters.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, for the North Vietnamese {{the battle}} was {{just one part of}} the May Offensive, {{although}} they later claimed to have killed 800 Australians during a single attack—a fact which may have indicated the importance they placed on it at the time. They had reacted quickly and proficiently to mount a battalion attack on the first night in an attempt to push the Australians off their line of communications; however, while the attacks on Coral and Balmoral had been well co-ordinated, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong had repeatedly surrendered the element of surprise with preparatory fire and poor light discipline alerting the defenders on each occasion. Meanwhile, rigid command-and-control arrangements and a lack of radio communications had forced the North Vietnamese to operate on fixed schedules, preventing them <b>from</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> initiative or responding rapidly to changing situations. Such inflexibility had resulted in predictability, with the communist commanders ultimately committing their forces to a frontal assault on Coral on the first night, and mounting very similar attacks against Balmoral on the nights of 26 and 28 May, both of which ended in costly failures.|$|E
5|$|Lady Jane Grey was the {{great-granddaughter}} of Henry VII {{through his}} youngest daughter Mary Tudor, and first cousin once removed to his grandson, King Edward VI. After Edward's death, a Protestant faction proclaimed her queen over Henry VIII's daughters, hoping {{to prevent the}} Catholic Mary Tudor <b>from</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> throne. Two weeks {{after the death of}} her brother, Mary, {{with the support of the}} English people, claimed the throne, which Jane relinquished only nine days after being installed. She and her husband, Lord Guildford Dudley, were imprisoned in the Tower of London on charges of high treason. Jane's trial was conducted in November, but her sentence of death was suspended. In February 1554, Jane's father Henry, who had been pardoned, participated in Wyatt's rebellion. On 12 February, Mary had Jane, then aged 16, and her husband beheaded; Jane's father suffered the same fate two days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{third round}} of green-flag pit stops {{commenced}} fifteen laps later when Bräck became the first driver to stop. Franchitti inherited the first position until he made his pit stop on lap 143, handing it to Manning. This meant Manning became the first driver to lead his début CART race twice. The fourth caution was necessitated on the 155th lap when Manning's right-hand rear wing endplate became detached and landed on the track {{between the first and}} second turns. Manning made a pit stop but his crew elected not to make repairs to his rear wing. It assisted in making his car develop less understeer and slightly improved its balance. Racing resumed on lap 163 with Bräck leading a single-file restart. The left side of Kanaan's car collided heavily with the wall on the backstraight six laps later, triggering the fifth (and final) caution. All drivers (including Bräck) made pit stops under caution. A crew member on Bräck's team dropped a left-rear wheel nut dropping him to ninth place. Fernández was observed speeding and was required to move to the rear of the field. Da Matta's team were slow to fit his right-rear tyre preventing him <b>from</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> first position and he emerged in second place.|$|E

5|$|With party support eroded, Treatt did {{not remain}} long as leader afterwards. On Friday 6 August 1954, Treatt {{announced}} that he would resign as leader on 10 August. At the following party meeting, after a deadlocked vote between Askin and Morton, Askin persuaded Murray Robson to accept the Leadership of the Liberal Party as a compromise candidate. Like other senior members of the party, after having no conservative government since Alexander Mair in 1941, Robson had no experience in government, he had little interest in policy except for Cold War anti-communism, ignored majority views of his party and fellow parliamentary colleagues and further alienated party members by trying to forge a closer alliance with Michael Bruxner's Country Party. Over a year after Robson had assumed the leadership, at a party meeting on 20 September 1955, senior party member Ken McCaw moved that the leadership be declared vacant, citing that Robson's leadership lacked the qualities necessary for winning the next election. The motion was carried 15 votes to 5. Robson then moved a motion to prevent Morton, who was the only person nominated for leader, <b>from</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> leadership. This was defeated 16 votes to 6 and Morton was elected unnopposed as leader, with Robert Askin remaining as Deputy Leader.|$|E
5|$|In the {{build up}} to the World Cup Charlton gave out first caps to Gary Kelly, Phil Babb and Jason McAteer; he had {{difficulty}} convincing McAteer to join Ireland as he first had to turn down an approach by the FA {{to play for the}} England under-21s. He scheduled difficult matches before the tournament and Ireland picked up positive results by beating both the Netherlands and Germany away from home. Ireland opened the group stage of the tournament by beating Italy 1–0 at the Giants Stadium, Ray Houghton scoring the winning goal on 11 minutes. They then fell to a 2–1 defeat to Mexico at the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium, during which Charlton had a pitch-side argument with an official who was preventing substitute John Aldridge (who went on to score the consolation goal) <b>from</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> pitch minutes after his teammate Tommy Coyne had left the pitch {{and sat down on the}} bench. For his arguing, Charlton was suspended by FIFA for the final group game against Norway, and had to watch from the commentary box as Ireland qualified with a 0–0 draw. They faced the Netherlands in the Round of 16; Dennis Bergkamp put the Dutch ahead on 11 minutes after Marc Overmars took advantage of a mistake by Terry Phelan, and Wim Jonk scored the second and final goal of the game from 30 yards after Packie Bonner fluffed an otherwise routine save. For his achievements Charlton was awarded the Freedom of the City of Dublin in 1994 by Lord Mayor Tomás Mac Giolla, the first Englishman to be given the honour since 1854.|$|E
