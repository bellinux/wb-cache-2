5|$|Ice ages {{during the}} Pleistocene brought a cooler and wetter pluvial climate {{to the region}} {{starting}} 2 to 3million years ago. The added precipitation increased runoff and the erosive ability of streams (especially from spring melt water and flash floods in summer).

5|$|The {{ability to}} <b>excavate</b> allows {{woodpeckers}} to obtain tree sap, {{an important source}} of food for some species. Most famously, the sapsuckers (genus Sphyrapicus) feed in this fashion, but the technique is not restricted to these, and others such as the acorn woodpecker and white-headed woodpecker also feed on sap. It was once thought that the technique was restricted to the New World, but Old World species, such as the Arabian woodpecker and great spotted woodpecker, also feed in this way.|$|E

50|$|Of the {{approximately}} 150 square meters of “living area” inside the cave, {{about a fifth}} has been <b>excavated,</b> and only half of that area has been <b>excavated</b> {{all the way down}} to bedrock. This was primarily due to constraints on time and resources, which stopped excavation from being extended to promising areas or even bringing the whole of the <b>excavated</b> area down to bedrock; instead, efforts were focused on obtaining a large sample of artifacts and floral and faunal remains from the area already <b>excavated.</b>|$|R
5|$|The fort was rediscovered {{by historians}} and {{excavated}} in 1996, {{and the area}} is now an archaeological site. In 1995, researchers located the ship La Belle in Matagorda Bay, with several sections of the hull remaining virtually intact. They constructed a cofferdam, {{the first to be}} used in North America to <b>excavate</b> the ship as if in dry conditions. In 2000, excavations revealed three of the original structures of the fort, as well as three graves of Frenchmen.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Excavating</b> trace {{impact the}} {{production}} efficiency and overall performance of shovel directly. Hence, it’s of very realistic significance {{to obtain the}} optimal <b>excavating</b> trace. Based on site test data, the point of tangency of the rack pitch line of the bucket rod and the pitch circle of the crowd gear were determined as the rotating center and the dynamic model of working mechanism was derived; due to the change law of the current and voltage of the hoist motor, the <b>excavating</b> process sections was separated from the <b>excavating</b> trace; log spiral model {{was chosen as the}} fitting function, and according to the following three judgment rules: maximizing soil volume in bucket, rationalizing the <b>excavating</b> time and minimizing the energy consumption of unit mass of soil in bucket, the optimal <b>excavating</b> trace was obtained and provided basis for the operation and design of the large mining shovel...|$|R
5|$|A neutron {{spectrometer}} {{on board the}} Lunar Prospector spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to {{the northern and southern}} lunar poles, including the crater Shackleton. At the end of this mission in July 1999, the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth-based telescopes an impact-generated plume containing water vapor. The impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor, and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals, or that the impact site did not contain any ice. Alternatively, {{it is possible that the}} crash did not <b>excavate</b> deeply enough into the regolith to liberate significant quantities of water vapor.|$|E
5|$|Aston and Taylor {{subsequently}} {{decided to}} work together on a new archaeological television series, devising the format for Time Team. Whilst Taylor organised the film production side of the project with Channel 4, Aston located suitable sites to <b>excavate,</b> and gathered together a team of specialists to appear on the show, among them field archaeologists Harding and Carenza Lewis, artist Victor Ambrus, and historian Robin Bush. He knew the actor and television presenter Tony Robinson after they had met on an archaeological course in Greece, and successfully requested that he present the show. From an early stage, they had agreed that every episode would feature a practical process or a re-enactment alongside the field archaeology.|$|E
5|$|Being {{located just}} inside the Lions' Gate, {{one of the major}} entries to the Old City, the East Jerusalem Development Company {{initially}} intended to <b>excavate</b> the reservoir and build a multi-storey car park at the site.

Subsequently, in 1981 a small square equipped with benches was constructed on part of the covered pool.|$|E
40|$|Scraping and <b>excavating</b> parrotfishes {{are well}} known for their marked {{differences}} in jaw morphology and feeding behaviour. Despite the importance of parrotfishes to reef systems and the well-known differences within the group, few studies have compared the functional importance of scraping versus <b>excavating</b> parrotfishes in shaping coral reef benthic communities. We compared the abundance, depth and dynamics of scraping and <b>excavating</b> parrotfish grazing scars on massive Porites spp. colonies along a reef gradient at Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef. Scraping grazing scars were more abundant at most study sites than <b>excavating</b> scars. <b>Excavating</b> grazing scars were relatively rare but exposed more coral skeleton than scraping scars. Approximately 70 % of <b>excavating</b> scars had some degree of filamentous algal growth in the scar compared with just 5 % of scraping scars. Scraping grazing scars on massive Porites spp. completely disappeared after 2 mo whereas <b>excavating</b> grazing scars remained almost unchanged over this period. Groups of <b>excavating</b> scars were more tightly clustered, exposed more coral skeleton and presented higher algal cover than grouped scraping scars. The deep, long-lasting <b>excavating</b> scars probably provide more suitable sites for the settlement of benthic algae and other invasive taxa on coral colonies. In contrast, the abundant and frequent grazing scars of scraping parrotfish may represent a more constant drain on energy supplies for coral colonies. These results highlight the differences between parrotfishes with distinct feeding modes and indicate that they differently impact not only algal communities but also coral colonies...|$|R
