5|$|Duquesne {{was unable}} to extend its streak on the road against St. Louis, as they lost 59–69. Bill Clark led the team with 17points and Saunders grabbed four steals, enough to raise his per-game average to 2.9, a nation-leading figure. With this, Saunders had at one point {{led the nation in}} double-doubles, rebounds, and steals. The Dukes lost again, 80–92, in their final road game against Saint Bonaventure. The loss put a <b>damper</b> <b>on</b> Duquesne's hopes for a home game {{in the first round of}} the Atlantic 10 tournament, as they fell into a tie for the ninth seed position.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1873 put a <b>damper</b> <b>on</b> this growth, and in {{the interim}} the city's steel {{industry}} began to decline, squeezed by competition from newer, more efficient producers in Western Pennsylvania and the Midwest {{on one side and}} labor unrest at home. But the textile industry remained strong, and even grew. Accordingly, its residents continued to embrace new movements in architecture. The 1880 pharmacy building at 137 Second Street featured a highly decorated cast iron storefront and curved windows showing the influence of the Queen Anne Style. Further down Second Street, industrialist Jonas Heartt's house built that same year {{is one of the best}} residential applications of the same style.|$|E

The full scope of British victories in 1758 did not reach English shores until later in the year, when Pitt learned of the successes at Forts Duquesne and Frontenac, key steps in completing the conquest of New France. Had Carillon also fallen in 1758, the conquest might have been completed in 1758 or 1759; as it happened, Montreal (the last point of resistance) did not surrender until 1760, with campaigns launched from Fort Oswego, Quebec, and Carillon, which was captured and renamed Ticonderoga in 1759 by forces under the command of Jeffrey Amherst, the victor at Louisbourg.|$|E
40|$|Synchronized switch <b>damping</b> <b>on</b> {{inductor}} {{offers a}} high damping {{performance in a}} broad frequency range. It consists of an inductor and resistor in a serial configuration, which are connected and disconnected from the piezoceramics in an alternating manner by a switch. When the switch is triggered by the vibration itself, it adapts to different excitation frequencies especially in the low frequency range. This article presents a detailed study of the damping performance of the synchronized switch <b>damping</b> <b>on</b> inductor technique. Calculations are performed in a normalized way. The optimal tuning of synchronized switch <b>damping</b> <b>on</b> inductor network parameters is derived, and the corresponding maximum damping performance is obtained. The results are further compared to standard linear inductance-resistance networks. For a validation of the theoretical results, measurements on a clamped beam test rig are performed. Therefore, the synchronized switch <b>damping</b> <b>on</b> inductor circuit is realized as a synthetic impedance in a DSpace environment. The measurement results are in good agreement with the theoretical calculations. © The Author(s) 2012...|$|R
40|$|Squeeze-film <b>damping</b> <b>on</b> microresonators is a {{significant}} damping source even when the surrounding gas is highly rarefied. This article presents a general modeling approach based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for the prediction of squeeze-film <b>damping</b> <b>on</b> resonators in the free-molecule regime. The generality of the approach is demonstrated in its capability of simulating resonators of any shape and with any accommodation coefficient. The approach is validated using both the analytical results of the free-space damping and the experimental data of the squeeze-film <b>damping</b> <b>on</b> a clamped clamped plate resonator oscillating at its first flexure mode. The effect of oscillation modes on the quality factor of the resonator has also been studied and semi-analytical approximate models for the squeeze-film damping with diffuse collisions have been developed...|$|R

In 1928, the Southern Pacific Railroad stopped service to Yaquina City.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{analytical}} {{investigation of the}} possibility of employing damping elements to prevent chatter instability in wood machining is presented. A simplified model of a two-degree-of-freedom machine for wood cutting is first established. Then, the stabilizing effect of <b>damping</b> <b>on</b> the initially unstable and undamped system is investigated. The influence of <b>damping</b> <b>on</b> flutter and divergence instability is analyzed separately following different approaches. Some simplified assumptions are made to facilitate the analysis and a set of explicit conditions ensuring stability is found. Since the studied system is nonconservative, not only the effect of <b>damping</b> <b>on</b> the initially unstable system is investigated, but also its effect on the initially stable system. In particular, a condition preventing the destabilization of the system is achieved through the eigenvalue sensitivity analysis. The results attained might ensure important productivity improvements in real wood machining application...|$|R

By 1991 there were enough African Esperantists to warrant a pan-African congress. The language continues to spread, although it is not officially recognised by any country, and is part of the state educational curriculum of only a few.|$|E
25|$|Although mining had {{provided}} foreign exchange, {{the vast majority}} of Hondurans gained their livelihoods from agriculture, usually on a subsistence level. Periodic efforts were made to develop agricultural exports, but they met with little success. Some tobacco, cattle, and hides were exported, mostly to neighboring countries. The recurring civil conflicts and the resultant confiscation of stock by various military commanders, however, put a <b>damper</b> <b>on</b> efforts to develop the cattle industry and contributed to its rather backward status. Some bananas and other fruits were exported from the Islas de la Bahía, much of this trade going to New Orleans, but the volume was small and the benefit {{for the rest of the}} nation almost imperceptible.|$|E

The embargo of 1807 was the starting point on the path to the War of 1812 with Great Britain. Both Great Britain and France imposed trade restrictions in order to weaken each other's economies. This also had the effect of disrupting American trade and testing the United States' neutrality. As time went on, harassment of American ships by the British Navy increased. This included impressment and seizures of American men and goods.|$|E
