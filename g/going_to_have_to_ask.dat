40|$|Powerpoint: [URL] {{blending}} and {{the indirect}} framing of directive constructions Speakers resort to pseudo-directive constructions {{when attempting to}} get someone to do something without giving the impression of restricting the addressee's freedom of choice of action or without impinging upon the addressee's self-assessment that s/he has that freedom of choice. One efficient (i. e. face-saving) strategy consists in blending a covert coding of the speaker's authority and an overt coding of the addressee's freedom of non-compliance into the same construction. This is generally done compressively, both at the formal and conceptual levels. In XXXX (2005), we showed that the you (don't) want to/ wanna X construction (e. g. {{you want to make}} a left turn, you don't wanna miss that) displayed the main properties of a grammatical blend (Fauconnier and Turner 1996), among which the dual inheritance principle and, above all, compression (morphosyntactic and conceptual). In this case, grammatical blending successfully frames the directive as collaborative work (the speaker appears as willing to help the addressee) and thus mitigates the inherent coerciveness of the act. In this paper I will show that grammatical blending may serve the same function in expansive (pseudo-) directive strategies: (1) A- I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you to leave. B- You're kicking me out? A- No, I'm not saying that. B- Ok, then I can stay? ( [...] .) A- I'm asking you to leave. B- Are you kicking me out? A- No. (2) I told you again not to take any photographs. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you to stay behind. (3) I'm afraid I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you to check with the Defense Department. (4) Mister, you can say anything you want about me, but I'm gonna have to ask you not to talk about my horse that way. In this construction (I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you to X) the driving force of the illocutionary intent (Speaker wants Addressee to X > structural type: 'Speaker asks Addressee to X') is disguised as something impending (going to) and extrinsic from the speaker's own will (have to). The compositional combination of directive strategies is blended into a composite construction. However, despite its internal complexity, the expanded construction assumes some morphosyntactic and prosodic unity, insofar as each of its formal components displays a high degree of collostruction strength to the composite structure (Stefanowitsch and Gries 2003, 2005). This paper will show that compression - a defining property of conceptual integration (Fauconnier and Turner 2000) - does not (always) correspond in a one-to-one fashion with morphosyntactic chunking in a grammatical blend. This observation will be corroborated by empirical research on innovative directive strategies in Japanese (Smith 1992, Sunaoshi 1995, Takano 2005). Those case studies, combined with a critical examination of recent works on the topic (Fauconnier and Turner 2002, Mandelblit 2000, etc.), will form the basis for a renewed (and expanded) definition of grammatical blending. Finally, these newly defined constructional integration networks will be described in light of the Fuzzy Construction Grammar framework (Desagulier 2005). REFERENCES Blum-Kulka, S. 1989.

Some days this can give you (× 100) speed improvement, sometimes it feels like (× 1. 2), it depends on how efficiently you’ve already coded in R, how many “apply() ” and “sum() ” you may have successfully used.

40|$|As face-threatening acts, {{directives}} can {{be perceived}} as impolite if the illocutionary force is not properly mitigated. One efficient mitigating strategy is via hedging. While most studies consider hedges either in isolation or in parallel distribution, l investigate how speakers mitigate directives by combining hedges. My case-study is the construction, of which (1) is a paradigm example: (1) I'm afraid I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you to leave I test two working hypotheses: 1) the full catenative sequence + + + marks iconic distance between the speaker (S) and the FTA ("ask Addressee (A) not to do X"); 2) the more catenative elements {{are present in the}} construction, the less constraining and impolite the request, and vice versa. I use the Corpus of Contemporary American English to extract all instances of the construction depicted above containing {{one or more of the}} relevant hedges. I conduct a multiple correspondence analysis to detect significant interactions (a) between hedges, (b) between hedges and elements that characterize the FTA. Results show that there is a correlation between the kinds and numbers of hedges that are used and the kinds of speech act that are done, with special regards to their potential for social conflict...|$|E
