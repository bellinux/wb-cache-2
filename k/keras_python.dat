40|$|This work {{presents}} EddyNet, a {{deep learning}} based architecture for automated eddy detection and classification from Sea Surface Height (SSH) maps {{provided by the}} Copernicus Marine and Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS). EddyNet is a U-Net like network that consists of a convolutional encoder-decoder followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The output is a map with the same size of the input where pixels have the following labels {' 0 ': Non eddy, ' 1 ': anticyclonic eddy, ' 2 ': cyclonic eddy}. We investigate the use of SELU activation function instead of the classical ReLU+BN and we use an overlap based loss function instead of the cross entropy loss. <b>Keras</b> <b>Python</b> code, the training datasets and EddyNet weights files are open-source and freely available on [URL]...|$|E
40|$|We {{implemented}} a deep neural network, which we trained to generate image captions. The neural network connects computer vision and natural language processing. We followed existing architectures {{for the same}} problem and implemented our architecture with <b>Keras</b> library in <b>Python.</b> We retrieved data from an online data collection MS COCO. Our solution implements a bimodal architecture and uses deep convolutional, recurrent and fully connected neural networks. For processing and collecting image features we used the VGG 16 architecture. We used GloVe embeddings for word representation. The final model was trained on a collection of 82. 783 and tested on 40. 504 images and their descriptions. We evaluated the model with the BLEU score metric and obtained a value of 49. 0 and classification accuracy of 60 %. Current state-of-the-art models were not surpassed, but we see many possibilities for improvements...|$|R
30|$|The {{architecture}} of CNN mimics {{the structure of}} animal visual cortex. The input image patch is firstly passed to several consecutive layers that convolute and downsample the patch, followed by a flattening layer which stretches the patch into a feature vector. After the flattening layer, the subsequent layers (namely the fully connected layers and the softmax layer) convert the feature vector into the output scores. In recent years, several improved CNN architectures have been proposed, but their overall architecture kept similar. This study used the well-known AlexNet [34] architecture implemented using the <b>Keras</b> library for <b>Python.</b> To avoid overfitting to our data, the number of AlexNet layers was reduced to five. Our CNN also incorporated L 2 normalization, ReLU activation function, dropout regularization, categorical cross entropy loss function, and Adadelta learning method. The choice of CNN architecture will be further explained in the “Discussion” section.|$|R
