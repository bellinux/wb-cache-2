5|$|In October 2010, Sergei Shmatko, Russia's energy minister, {{stated that}} Russia and Iceland would work {{together}} to develop Kamchatka's geothermal energy sources. Russia is also investigating foreign investment possibilities for developing geothermal energy in the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Islands.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Islands</b> of Russia, Nabi dropped about 75mm (3in) of rain, {{equivalent}} to the monthly average. Gusts reached 83km/h (51mph), weak enough not to cause major damage. During the storm's passage, high waves washed away unpaved roads in Severo-Kurilsk.|$|E
5|$|P. m. saturatus, {{described}} by Leonhard Hess Stejneger in 1885, breeds in Sakhalin, the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Islands,</b> Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. It is deeper brown than the nominate subspecies {{and has a}} larger bill.|$|E

5000|$|Both Broutona Island and {{its highest}} point, 801m Broutona Mount in Russia's <b>Kurils</b> <b>Islands</b> are named for William Robert Broughton.|$|R
25|$|With Shumshu and Paramushiro under Soviet control, {{the rest}} of the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Island</b> chain, much more lightly held by Japanese forces, fell to Soviet forces easily. The Soviets {{completed}} their occupation of the Kurils on 5 September 1945.|$|R
5|$|After {{becoming}} extratropical, Higos {{affected the}} <b>Kuril</b> <b>Islands</b> and later Sakhalin. Power {{was cut in}} 22towns, and ferry service was canceled. On Sakhalin, high winds downed many trees, some of which blocked roads. Six people were injured by fallen trees. The remnants of Higos capsized two ships offshore Primorye, killing seven people.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{forces were}} still {{fighting}} against the Soviets {{as well as the}} Chinese, and managing their cease-fire and surrender was difficult. The last air combat by Japanese fighters against American reconnaissance bombers took place on August 18. The Soviet Union continued to fight until early September, taking the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Islands.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rough {{waves from}} Typhoon Etau {{produced}} rip currents on Saipan that swept up four swimmers, who were later rescued after holding onto a buoy. The outer {{periphery of the}} storm caused P36.98million (PHP, $673,000 USD) in damage, mostly to infrastructure with some minor crop damage. Late in its duration, Etau caused damage in Russia's <b>Kuril</b> <b>Islands.</b>|$|E
50|$|The trench {{formed as}} a result of the {{subduction}} zone, which formed in the late Cretaceous, that created the <b>Kuril</b> <b>island</b> arc as well as the Kamchatka volcanic arc. The Pacific Plate is being subducted beneath the Okhotsk Plate along the trench, resulting in intense volcanism.|$|R
50|$|The Hidaka Mountains {{formed in}} the late Quaternary {{as part of the}} outer arc of the western end of the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Island</b> Arc. They were formed by the uplift {{resulting}} from the collision with the Kuril arc and the Northeast Japan Arc. The Hidaka mountains no longer appear to be uplifting.|$|R
50|$|Born in 1769 on Awaji Island, Takadaya Kahei (高田屋嘉兵衛) was a Japanese {{merchant}} {{credited with}} transforming the trading outpost of Hakodate in Japan's northern island of Hokkaidō into a thriving city. He is also recognised for opening the northern Etorofu sea {{route to the}} <b>Kuril</b> <b>island</b> fisheries and helping settle territorial disputes with Russia over the islands.|$|R
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the attack, the ship was anchored at Ariake Bay, Kyushu beginning in September 1941 while its aircraft were based at Kagoshima to train with the other 1st Air Fleet air units for the Pearl Harbor operation. Once preparations and training were completed, Akagi assembled {{with the rest of}} the First Air Fleet at Hitokappu Bay in the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Islands</b> on 22 November 1941. The ships departed on 26 November 1941 for Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces {{conducted}} many {{air raids}} on Japan during World War II, causing extensive destruction to the country's cities and killing between 241,000 and 900,000 people. During {{the first years}} of the Pacific War these attacks were limited to the Doolittle Raid in April 1942 and small-scale raids on military positions in the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Islands</b> from mid-1943. Strategic bombing raids began in June 1944 and continued until the end of the war in August 1945. Allied naval and land-based tactical air units also attacked Japan during 1945.|$|E
5|$|For the {{commanding}} officers stationed on the Aleutian Islands during the Aleutian Islands campaign, attacking the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Islands</b> from the Aleutians was a logical continuation to recapturing Attu and Kiska. However, these officers faced resistance from their superiors in Washington and their {{troops on the}} ground. Troop morale had sharply declined {{as a result of}} the island's dismal conditions, creating a condition that the troops called the 'Aleutian stare' amongst those who had been on the island for more than six months. An American assault of the Kuriles never materialised.|$|E
50|$|A {{small number}} of minke whales were caught by the Soviets in the western North Pacific, with 21 being taken by pelagic fleets between 1933 and 1979 and an {{additional}} 94 being caught by catchers operating out of the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Island</b> land stations - the annual catch in the latter region never exceeded nine or ten whales (1951, 1954, and 1956).|$|R
50|$|Sakhalin Island Arc is {{an ancient}} {{volcanic}} arc dating from the Early Miocene. The arc {{was a result of}} the Okhotsk Plate subducting beneath the Eurasian Plate in the convergence zone. The arc runs from mainland Asia through Sakhalin Island into central Hokkaido and the collision zone around the Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group, where the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Island</b> Arc and the Northeastern Japan Arc meet.|$|R
5000|$|The island {{consists}} of a dormant or extinct stratovolcano, Pik Mitaka -( [...] влк.Митака Japanese 三高山; Mitakayama), which rises to 1169 m above sea level. The island has steep cliff sides and no sandy beaches, making landing very difficult and dangerous even in calm weather.Makanrushi is 28 km away from Onekotan. Makanrushi thus lies behind the main currently-active arc of <b>Kuril</b> <b>Island</b> volcanoes.|$|R
5|$|In 1977, the 51st Combined Arms Army was re-formed on {{the basis}} of the staff of the 2nd Army Corps in the Far East Military District. The army was {{stationed}} on Sakhalin and in the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Islands.</b> The 79th Motor Rifle Division was disbanded in 1994. On 11 October 1993 the army was reorganized as the 68th Army Corps. Its 33rd Motor Rifle Division and 18th Machine Gun Artillery Division became part of the 68th Army Corps. The 68th Army Corps disbanded in 2010, but was later reformed in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In Asia, the United States led the {{occupation}} of Japan and administrated Japan's former islands in the Western Pacific, while the Soviets annexed Sakhalin and the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Islands.</b> Korea, formerly under Japanese rule, was divided and occupied by the Soviet Union in the North and the US in the South between 1945 and 1948. Separate republics emerged {{on both sides of}} the 38th parallel in 1948, each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of Korea, which led ultimately to the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|In eastern Asia, the russet sparrow {{is found}} in Sakhalin, the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Islands,</b> {{a small part of}} {{mainland}} Russia, Japan, southern Korea, and part of northern China, where it is mostly migratory. It is distributed through southern China and Taiwan, and the mountainous parts of Burma, southern Northeast India, Laos, and Vietnam, where it is mostly resident. The russet sparrow also occurs as a winter visitor in southern Japan, the further south of China, and northern Thailand. In eastern Asia, the autumn migration occurs between August and November.|$|E
50|$|In 1779, the Tokugawa shogunate took {{direct control}} over Hakodate, which {{triggered}} rapid {{development in the}} area. Merchant Takadaya Kahei, who is honoured as the founder of Hakodate port, set up trading operations, which included opening the northern Etorofu sea route to the <b>Kuril</b> <b>island</b> fisheries. He is credited with turning Hakodate from a trading outpost into a thriving city. A Hakodate magistracy was established in 1802.|$|R
50|$|Srednego Strait (Russian: Proliv Srednego; Japanese: Suride Kaikyo) is a strait that {{separates}} the islands of Rasshua and Ushishir. It is about 14.5 km (about 9 mi) wide. The strait is obstructed by several rocks and reefs and has tidal currents that reach four knots and create heavy tide rips, reportedly making it the most dangerous passage for vessel traffic in the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Island</b> chain.|$|R
40|$|Here {{we present}} review {{data on the}} {{geographic}} distribution and biogeography of the Sakhalin biota and attempt to analyze its general structure based on indicator taxonomic groups of terrestrial and freshwater organisms (i. e., fungi, plants, and animals). The work {{is based on a}} long-term program designed to survey and inventory the biota of Sakhalin Island: the International Sakhalin Island Project, an extension of the International <b>Kuril</b> <b>Island</b> Projectreported on by Pietsch et al. (2003) ...|$|R
5|$|The extratropical {{remnants}} of Noul continued to the northeast. Around 12:00UTC on May12, the storm {{passed through the}} Kantō region of southeastern Japan. The center quickly moved back over water and passed just east of Hokkaido on May13. Noul slowed its forward motion while remaining south of the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Islands</b> and Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. At 06:00UTC on May16, the {{remnants of}} Noul dissipated near the international date line, after being absorbed by another large extratropical storm.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{the most}} stable and secure {{part of the sea}} otter's range is Russia. Before the 19th century, around 20,000 to 25,000 sea otters lived near the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Islands,</b> with more near Kamchatka and the Commander Islands. After the years of the Great Hunt, the {{population}} in these areas, currently part of Russia, was only 750. By 2004, sea otters had repopulated all of their former habitat in these areas, with an estimated total population of about 27,000. Of these, about 19,000 are at the Kurils, 2,000 to 3,500 at Kamchatka and another 5,000 to 5,500 at the Commander Islands. Growth has slowed slightly, suggesting the numbers are reaching carrying capacity.|$|E
5|$|Following the Doolittle Raid, {{the next}} air attacks on Japan were made against the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Islands</b> in mid-1943. The liberation of Alaska's Attu Island in May 1943 during the Aleutian Islands Campaign {{provided}} the USAAF with bases {{within range of}} the Kurils. As part of the preparations for the liberation of Kiska Island in the Aleutians, the Eleventh Air Force {{conducted a series of}} raids against the Kurils to suppress the Japanese air units stationed there. The first of these attacks was made against southern Shumshu and northern Paramushiru by eight B-25s on 10July. The Kurils were attacked again on 18July by six B-24 Liberator heavy bombers, and the unopposed liberation of Kiska (Operation Cottage) took place on 15August.|$|E
50|$|The Kuril-Kamchatka Trench or Kuril Trench (Курило-Камчатский жёлоб, Kurilo-Kamchatkii Zhyolob) is an oceanic trench in the {{northwest}} Pacific Ocean. It lies off the southeast coast of Kamchatka and parallels the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Island</b> chain to meet the Japan Trench east of Hokkaido. It extends from a triple junction with the Ulakhan Fault and the Aleutian Trench near the Commander Islands, Russia, in the northeast, to the intersection with the Japan Trench in the southwest.|$|R
30|$|The large slip near trench is {{not common}} for great (Mw > 8) {{subduction}} earthquakes. However, the 2011 Tohoku earthquake {{should not be}} counted as the only example. Another recent case we have studied is the 2006 Mw 8.3 <b>Kuril</b> <b>island</b> earthquake. Our inversion yielded a peak slip of 9 m near the trench axis. ([URL] The geological post-tsunami survey in 2007 revealed up to 20 m local tsunami runups (MacInnes et al., 2009). This preliminary slip model is also remarkably similar to the result of Lay et al. (2009).|$|R
5000|$|Neves {{and other}} Brazilian anthropologists have theorized that Luzia's Paleo-Indian {{predecessors}} lived in South East Asia {{for tens of}} thousands of years, after migrating from Africa, and began arriving in the New World, as early as 15,000 years ago. The oldest confirmed date for an archaeosite in the Americas is 18,500 and 14,500 cal BP. for the Monte Verde site in southern Chile. [...] Some anthropologists have hypothesized that a population from coastal East Asia migrated in boats along the <b>Kuril</b> <b>island</b> chain, the Beringian coast, and down the west coast of the Americas during the decline of the Last Glacial Maximum.|$|R
5|$|The Allies {{called for}} {{unconditional}} Japanese surrender in the Potsdam Declaration of 27 July, but the Japanese government rejected the call. In early August, the USAAF dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Allies justified the atomic bombings {{as a military}} necessity to avoid invading the Japanese home islands which would cost the lives of between 250,000 and 500,000 Allied servicemen and millions of Japanese troops and civilians. Between the two bombings, the Soviets, pursuant to the Yalta agreement, invaded Japanese-held Manchuria, and quickly defeated the Kwantung Army, which was the largest Japanese fighting force. The Red Army also captured Sakhalin Island and the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Islands.</b> On 15 August 1945, Japan surrendered, with the surrender documents finally signed at Tokyo Bay {{on the deck of}} the American battleship USS Missouri on 2 September 1945, ending the war.|$|E
5|$|For many {{maritime}} indigenous cultures {{throughout the}} North Pacific, especially the Ainu in the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Islands,</b> the Koryaks and Itelmen of Kamchatka, the Aleut in the Aleutian Islands, the Haida of Haida Gwaii {{and a host}} of tribes on the Pacific coast of North America, the sea otter has played an important role as a cultural, as well as material, resource. In these cultures, many of which have strongly animist traditions full of legends and stories in which many aspects of the natural world are associated with spirits, the sea otter was considered particularly kin to humans. The Nuu-chah-nulth, Haida, and other First Nations of coastal British Columbia used the warm and luxurious pelts as chiefs' regalia. Sea otter pelts were given in potlatches to mark coming-of-age ceremonies, weddings, and funerals. The Aleuts carved sea otter bones for use as ornaments and in games, and used powdered sea otter baculum as a medicine for fever.|$|E
5|$|No {{body parts}} were {{recovered}} by the Soviet search {{team from the}} surface of the sea in their territorial waters, though they would later turn over clothes and shoes to a joint U.S.–Japanese delegation to Nevelsk on Sakhalin. On Monday, September 26, 1983, a delegation of seven Japanese and U.S. officials arriving aboard the Japanese patrol boat Tsugaru, had met a six-man Soviet delegation at the port of Nevelsk on Sakhalin Island. KGB Major General A. I. Romanenko, the Commander of the Sakhalin and <b>Kuril</b> <b>Islands</b> frontier guard, headed the Soviet delegation. Romanenko handed over to the U.S. and the Japanese, among other things, single and paired footwear. With footwear that the Japanese also retrieved, the total came to 213 men's, women's and children's dress shoes, sandals, and sports shoes. The Soviets indicated these items were all that they had retrieved floating or on the shores of Sakhalin and Moneron islands.|$|E

40|$|New data on microstructures {{and mineral}} and {{chemical}} compositions of ferromanganese crusts sampled {{from the western}} slope of the <b>Kuril</b> <b>Island</b> Arc in the Sea of Okhotsk during cruises of R/V Vulkanolog are discussed. The study of the crusts using analytical electron microscopy methods revealed that their manganese phase is represented by vernadite, Fe-vernadite, todorokite, asbolane, and asbolane-buserite, while iron phase consists of hematite, hydrohematite, ferroxyhite, and magnetite. Lithic mineral assemblage includes apatite, quartz, epidote, and montmorillonite. According to chemical analysis most of the crusts contain significant part of volcanogenic and hydrothermal material. It is evident from elevated values of Mn/Fe and (Mn+Fe) /Ti ratios, low concentrations of some trace elements, and positive Eu anomaly...|$|R
