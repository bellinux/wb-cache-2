60|$|He soon {{observed}} {{that in some}} cases of women, the identification of persons, though complete, was quite at variance with the marks upon the linen; this led him to notice that even the marks upon the linen were sometimes inconsistent with one another; and thus he came to understand that they had dressed in great haste and agitation, and that their clothes had become mixed together. The identification of men by their dress, was rendered extremely difficult, in consequence of a large proportion of them being dressed alike--in clothes of one kind, that is to say, supplied by slopsellers and outfitters, and not made by single garments but by hundreds. Many of the men were bringing over parrots, and had receipts upon them for the price of the birds; others had bills of exchange in their pockets, or in belts. Some of these documents, carefully unwrinkled and dried, were little less <b>fresh</b> <b>in</b> <b>appearance</b> that day, than the present page will be under ordinary circumstances, after having been opened three or four times.|$|E
50|$|The arkose {{sandstone}} {{which makes}} up the formation is composed of grains that show little sorting based on grain size, exhibit very little rounding and the feldspars in the rock are relatively <b>fresh</b> <b>in</b> <b>appearance.</b> This lack of sorting and grain rounding is typical of arkosic sandstones and is indicative of relatively rapid erosion from the granites of the growing mountains to the south. The layers of sand were nearly horizontal when deposited, but were tilted to their near vertical position during a later episode of mountain building, possibly the Alice Springs Orogeny of Palaeozoic age (400-300 Ma).|$|E
5000|$|The {{constituents}} {{of the rock}} suggests of its origin in particularly dry and high temperature conditions which is deduced to have an important bearing in explicating prehistoric crustal development of the earth.From the time Holland, named the rock as Charnockite, its characteristics have been extensively studied by several researches in Earth Sciences over the century. An analysis of three charnockites in the region, extending from St. Thomas Mount - Pallavaram -Tambaram, {{south of the city}} of Chennai, carried out on the compositional characteristics of coexisting orthopyroxene, garnet and biotite has established several petrographic varieties within the charnockites-enderbites such as the granulites and gneisses corresponding to adamellite, monzonite, granite and others.Another study on the general characteristics of the rocks of this series has recorded that the rocks are in general bluish gray or darkish in colour and extremely <b>fresh</b> <b>in</b> <b>appearance</b> with an even grained granular structure. The mineral composition shows an unvarying presence of pleochroic rhombic pyroxene. The other femic minerals noted are augite and hornblende with minute grains of opaque iron ores and these minerals have been noted to cluster together. Plagioclase feldspars, alkali feldspars and quartz are the salic minerals present in this series of rocks.In order to determine the geological age of the charnockitic region of the Pallavaram area in the Madras (Chennai) Block, palaeomagnetic investigations were carried out at 12 sites, which suggested an age of magnetization in the Pallavaram charnockites as 2600 Ma while in the St. Thomas Mount the period of emplacement was assessed as 1650 Ma (Mesoproterozoic). There was a further inference that the Madras block granulites indicated crustal evolution similar to those in the Eastern Ghats belt with identical palaeopoles from both the areas. The study also noted that “pressure, temperature and the chemical potential of water were constant for assemblages separated by large distances.” ...|$|E

40|$|This project {{demonstrates}} how the functional life of wall-to-wall carpet {{can be extended}} through the visual design process. The judicious selection of visual design strategies {{and the way they}} are integrated into the woven surface has the capability of retaining vibrancy and a <b>fresh</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>in</b> Axminster wall-to-wall carpet In carrying out this research I have studied and then exploited the historical and contemporary languages of design, including: pattern structure, illusion of depth, the psychological and physiological influence of colour and the characteristics of optical colour mixing. The carpet prototypes illustrating the research outcomes have been specifically designed for the high foot-traffic demands of today's hospitality and leisure industries. In developing the outcomes of my research I have investigated historical precedents which have significantly contributed to present-day wall-to-wall carpet design. This includes the appropriation of central and western Asian cultural motifs by English weavers in the 16 th century, the influence of fashion on carpet from the Neo-Classic period, the adoption of flat-coloured woven surfaces in Modernism and the influence of Postmodernism on interior architecture. The project also shows how forgotten design techniques such as those employed in Mamluk carpets can be applied in contemporary wall-to-wall carpet designs. While the research addresses the specific functional requirements of the hospitality and leisure industries, it also seeks to imbue the carpet prototypes with a sense of time and place by integrating imagery from Australia's natural environment and cultural heritage. In doing this my research {{demonstrates how}} the surface of wall-to-wall carpet can be a significant medium in articulating expressions of contemporary cultural relevance...|$|R
