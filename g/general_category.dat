25|$|Unicode {{provides}} a <b>general</b> <b>category</b> property for each character. So {{in addition to}} belonging to a script every character also has a <b>general</b> <b>category.</b> Typically scripts include letter characters including: uppercase letters, lowercase letter and modifier letters. Some characters are considered titlecase letters for a few precomposed ligatures such as ǲ (U+01F2). Such titlecase ligatures {{are all in the}} Latin and Greek scripts and are all compatibility characters, and therefore Unicode discourages their use by authors. It is unlikely that new titlecase letters will be added in the future.|$|E

25|$|In North America, Australia and South Africa pants is the <b>general</b> <b>category</b> term, whereas {{trousers}} (sometimes slacks in Australia and the United States) often refers {{more specifically}} to tailored garments with a waistband, belt-loops, and a fly-front. So informal elastic-waist knitted garments {{would be called}} pants, but not trousers (or slacks).|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{development of}} category theory was powered {{first by the}} computational needs of homological algebra, and later by the axiomatic needs of algebraic geometry. <b>General</b> <b>category</b> theory, an extension of universal algebra having many new features allowing for semantic flexibility and higher-order logic, came later; it is now applied throughout mathematics.|$|E
25|$|By association, {{the word}} has also been used to mean any sort of {{recurring}} theme, (whether or not subject to developmental transformation) in literature, or (metaphorically) {{the life of a}} fictional character or a real person.

These {{are included in}} a particular script when they are unique to that script. Other such characters are generally unified and included in the punctuation or diacritic blocks. However, the bulk of characters in any script (other than the common and inherited scripts) are letters.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of the 1970s was a {{short-lived}} peak in popularity for medieval folk rock. Gryphon enjoyed some mainstream success when they played the National theatre and Old Vic and supported Yes on tour. However, with line-up changes from about 1975 they began to drop their distinctive medieval sound and became increasingly a mainstream progressive rock band, before they dissolved in 1977. Similarly despite retaining elements of medieval music, bands like Gentle Giant rapidly moved off into further experimentation and were soon being classified under the more <b>general</b> <b>category</b> of progressive rock.|$|E
25|$|On 9 September Patel {{announced}} a new organisation, Patel Navnirman Sena (PNS), for nationwide extension of the agitation. Patel met former Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel prior to a meeting with government members on 14 September. 20 Patidar representatives led by Hardik Patel and Lalji Patel the meeting, which was chaired by the Chief Minister and attended by cabinet ministers. The issues discussed included the police action on 25 August, scholarship schemes for <b>general</b> <b>category</b> students, compensation to people died in violence, and release of arrested people. In a symbolic boycott, Patidars withdrew large amounts of cash from Kherol and Vadrad branches of Sabarkantha District Central Cooperative Bank of Sabarkantha district.|$|E

25|$|The largest {{demonstration}} {{was held}} in Ahmedabad on 25 August 2015, and was attended by thousands. Later, there were incidents of violence and arson across the state, resulting in a curfew in several cities and towns. Properties and vehicles worth crores of rupees were damaged and destroyed. The state returned to normalcy by 28 August. Despite talks with the government, the agitation recommenced and turned violent again on 19 September. The government announced a scheme which offered scholarships and subsidies to <b>general</b> <b>category</b> students on 24 September 2015 and a 10% quota of spaces reserved for economically backward classes in April 2016. The 10% reservation was quashed by the Gujarat High Court in August 2016.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{reservation}} of 15%, 7.5% and 27% {{seats are}} provided for candidates hailing from SC, ST and OBC communities. In case enough candidates {{do not meet}} minimum qualifying criteria as per written tests, SC/ST candidates are permitted a relaxation of 50%. If some vacancies still exists, a further relaxation is offered with a deferred admission after 1 year of Preparatory Course study covering physics, chemistry and mathematics. After one year of study, only those candidates {{who are able to}} clear a cut-off in the End Semester Exams are allowed into regular studies at the IITs. The seats reserved for SC/ST students are not transferable to <b>General</b> <b>Category</b> and roll on to the next year's students from the Preparatory Courses.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the government's assurances that seats will be increased in the institutes so that the <b>general</b> <b>category</b> students don't get affected, another point raised against reservation {{is that most of}} the seats reserved for SC/ST candidates remain empty and hence any more reservation is a waste of resources. A major concern among them is also the fact that implementing reservation in institutes of higher education would be difficult unless the quality of faculty in them is diluted. They back this point by the fact that all IITs and IIMs are facing shortage of faculty and hence increasing the seats will lead to deterioration of education. For example, while IIT Kharagpur requires 667 faculties, it currently has only 470. Similarly, IIT Bombay has just 401 faculties as against the required 529.|$|E

25|$|Gafni is {{the author}} of eight books on spirituality and religion, {{including}} the 2001 Soul Prints. Soul Prints included an introduction by Israeli poet Admiel Kosman and won the Napra Award for best Spirituality Book of 2001. Marc Gafni's second English-language book, The Mystery of Love, was later converted to an audio lecture series called The Erotic and the Holy, published by Sounds True. He also co-authored Who is Afraid of Lilith? Rereading the Kabbalah of the Feminine Shadow with Ohad Ezrachi. He wrote Radical Kabbalah, a two-volume work published by Integral Publishers in 2012. In 2012, he published Your Unique Self: The Radical Path to Personal Enlightenment with a foreword written by Wilber. It won the 2012 USA Book News Best Book of the Year award in the Spirituality: <b>General</b> <b>category.</b>|$|E
25|$|Price {{has also}} {{established}} {{herself in the}} publishing industry, despite having her work ghostwritten by Rebecca Farnworth. She released {{the first of four}} autobiographies Being Jordan in May 2004. Initially turned down by the mainstream publishing houses after demanding a £1million advance, she was eventually signed up by small independent publisher John Blake for £10,000 plus royalties. In a departure from industry norms, she conducted a 10-day book-signing tour which provoked enough interest – contrary to expectations and almost exclusively female – to propel her to first position in the Nielsen BookScan hardback sales chart and to sell 97,090 copies in one year; and over 1,000,000 as of January 2007. Her second autobiography, A Whole New World, was published in January 2006. It reached number two in the hardback <b>general</b> <b>category</b> and sold 198,105 copies by 1 April 2006.|$|E
25|$|The main {{argument}} against the concept of reservation is that it goes against the idea of merit and would dilute the IITs {{as one of the}} basic reasons behind their success is the excellent students they get via IIT-JEE. It is also being argued by the opposers that the irreparable damage caused during the childhood of the individual, cannot be rectified at a later stage. Also, the primary education provided by the government to the economically poor is highly inadequate, and this negligence by the government is the root cause of the problem. Statistics across the IIT's reveal that while about 4–5% of <b>general</b> <b>category</b> students do not complete their degree program, the number goes up to about 20% for reserved category students. This is used as an {{argument against}} reservations claiming that the reserved class candidates are not adequately prepared to face the challenging academic life in IITs.|$|E

[...] Qisas crimes include murder or any crime involving bodily harm. Tazir represents most cases, {{many of which are}} defined by national regulations such as bribery, trafficking, and drug abuse.
