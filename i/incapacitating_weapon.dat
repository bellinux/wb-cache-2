5000|$|Alexander claims credit as the {{inventor}} of the non-lethal, <b>incapacitating</b> <b>weapon</b> [...] "sticky foam" [...] which was used with mixed results by U.S. Marines in Somalia in 1995.|$|E
50|$|Lasers {{of all but}} {{the lowest}} powers can {{potentially}} be used as <b>incapacitating</b> <b>weapons,</b> through their ability to produce temporary or permanent vision loss in varying degrees when aimed at the eyes. The degree, character, and duration of vision impairment caused by eye exposure to laser light varies {{with the power of}} the laser, the wavelength(s), the collimation of the beam, the exact orientation of the beam, and the duration of exposure. Lasers of even a fraction of a watt in power can produce immediate, permanent vision loss under certain conditions, making such lasers potential non-lethal but <b>incapacitating</b> <b>weapons.</b> The extreme handicap that laser-induced blindness represents makes the use of lasers even as non-lethal weapons morally controversial, and weapons designed to cause blindness have been banned by the Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons. Incidents of pilots being exposed to lasers while flying have prompted aviation authorities to implement special procedures to deal with such hazards.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly after, it is {{discovered}} that the Grey Men have acquired a stockpile of nuclear weapons, which they plan to use against Osea and Yuktobania. Razgriz is sent to locate and <b>incapacitate</b> these <b>weapons.</b> They are aided in their task by an anonymous source from deep within Yuktobania, which eventually reveals itself to be an anti-war resistance organization led by Jack Bartlett. Bartlett had become the first POW of the war, but he had escaped.|$|R
5000|$|The chigiriki is a Japanese flail weapon. It {{consists}} of a solid or hollow wood (sometimes bamboo) or iron staff with an iron weight and chain on the end, sometimes retractable. The chigiriki is a more aggressive variation of the parrying weapon kusarigama.

50|$|ChromeSkull and Preston {{kill the}} detectives, then fight each other, with ChromeSkull coming out victorious when he decapitates Preston. ChromeSkull takes Preston's <b>weapon,</b> <b>incapacitates</b> Jess and Tommy, and attacks an {{investigating}} detective, {{along with a}} group of officers. ChromeSkull returns to Jess, but she fights him off long enough for the wounded detective to recover, and shoot the killer. The FBI arrives, takes Jess to a hospital, and tells the detective that they will be taking over his investigation. ChromeSkull escapes the factory, and is next shown in Hollywood conversing with Spann, who assures him that they will find Jess.|$|R
50|$|Non-lethal self-defense {{tools are}} also being sold under Kimber's PepperBlaster trademark. Kimber PepperBlasters are highly {{concentrated}} irritant high velocity <b>incapacitating</b> non-lethal chemical <b>weapons.</b> Since these non-lethal weapons are effective at ranges where most handgun and knife encounters occur, they {{could be used to}} defend against such attacks. They are also useful for hikers in the wild to discourage aggressive animals. These products are also a suitable self-defense weapon for college students and commuters, especially on campuses that prohibit the concealed carry of firearms. Recently, Kimber introduced the PepperBlaster II, a modification of the original designed with an ergonomic grip and sights to enhance aiming.|$|R
