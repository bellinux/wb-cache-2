2500|$|Powertrain {{detail of}} the Audi V8 {{featured}} one of two all-new, all-aluminium alloy engines – both petrol engines, and both in V8 configuration with 32 valves (four valves per cylinder) with dual valve springs, and four overhead camshafts (DOHC). The design set the pattern for future Audi-developed Volkswagen Group V8 engines. In addition to using an all-aluminum alloy cylinder block (when the established material was grey cast iron), the camshafts were driven using a hybrid method. A rubber/kevlar toothed timing belt, driven {{from the front of}} the crankshaft operated only the <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> in each bank. [...] The inlet camshafts were then operated via a simplex roller chain from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> – the right bank, (cylinders 1–4) at the rear of the engine, and the left bank (cylinders 5–8) at the front of the engine, immediately behind the timing belt. This method reduced the complexity of the timing belt layout, and as a result, required fewer components, such as idler rollers and guides, and lead to easier and less costly maintenance of the timing belt and associated components. [...] The intervals for changing the timing belts varied; the 3.6V8 (PT) required changing every , whereas the 4.2V8 (ABH) had a longer interval at [...] A thermostatically controlled electric cooling fan also became standard, replacing the engine-driven viscous fans on earlier cars. [...] This not only provided forced airflow for the engine coolant radiator, but also for the smaller engine oil cooler.|$|E
2500|$|The new A70 Supra engine, the Toyota 7M-GE, was the {{flagship}} engine of Toyota's arsenal. Both {{versions of the}} engine contained 4 valves per cylinder and dual overhead cams. The turbocharged 7M-GTE engine was Toyota's first distributor-less engine offered in the US which used coil packs sitting on the cam covers and a cam position sensor driven by the <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft.</b> It was equipped with a CT26 turbocharger and was rated at [...] at 5600 rpm while the naturally aspirated 7M-GE engine was rated at [...] at 6000 rpm. Further refinement on the turbo model increased power to [...] and [...] in 1989. This was mostly due to a redesign of the wastegate. All models used the same tire size of 225/50R16 on 16x7 inch wheels. Spare tires were full-sized but on steel wheels.|$|E
50|$|For twin cam or DOHC engines, VCT {{was used}} {{on either the}} intake or <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft.</b> (Engines that have VCT on both {{camshafts}} are now designated as Ti-VCT.) The use of variable camshaft timing on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> is for improved emissions, and vehicles with VCT on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> do not require exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) as retarding the exhaust cam timing achieves the same result. VCT on the intake camshaft is used primarily for increasing engine power and torque as the PCM is able to optimize {{the opening of the}} intake valves to match the engine conditions.|$|E

50|$|The Dual VVT-i system adjusts timing on both {{intake and}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts.</b> It was first {{introduced}} in 1998 on the RS200 Altezza's 3S-GE engine.|$|R
5000|$|In 1989, the {{displacement}} was enlarged to 2467 cc and this engine produced 175 kW (238 PS; 235 BHP). [...] Higher lift intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts</b> were used.Applications: ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{update of}} the S14B23 {{produced}} , or [...] if {{equipped with a}} catalytic converter. Changes include a revised intake camshaft profile and modified <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> timing, increased compression, and a more efficient cylinder head intake port design. Larger diameter exhaust header tubes are used.|$|E
50|$|A single {{timing belt}} drives the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft.</b> The cam {{journals}} are supported on five points between the valve lifters of each cylinder {{and on the}} front of the cylinder head, and are lubricated by an oiler port located in the middle of the camshaft.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{with its}} N42 predecessor, the N46 {{features}} a revised crankshaft, intake manifold and valvetrain. In 2007, the N46 was updated, which {{was known as}} the N46N. Changes included the intake manifold, <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> and the engine control unit was changed from Bosch ME9.2 to Bosch MV17.4.6.|$|E
50|$|The S85 has dual {{overhead}} camshafts with 4 valves per cylinder {{and variable}} valve timing on the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts</b> (double-VANOS). The engine block and cylinder head are constructed from Aluminum alloy.|$|R
50|$|The M62B48 was {{developed}} by Alpina, based on the M62TUB44 with variable valve timing also fitted to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts</b> (double-VANOS). It has a bore of 93 mm and a stroke of 89 mm.|$|R
50|$|The second-generation double VANOS system {{adjusts the}} timing of the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts</b> with {{continuously}} variable adjustment, based on engine speed and throttle opening. The first double VANOS system appeared on the S50B32 engine in 1996.|$|R
50|$|The TrailBlazer won the North American Truck of the Year {{award in}} 2002. The 4.2 L I6 Atlas LL8 {{appeared}} on the Ward's 10 Best Engines list from 2002-2005 with innovative features such as DOHC, Variable Valve Timing (VVT) on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft,</b> and GM's patented Lost-foam casting process.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998, the M52TU ("technical update") was released, adding {{variable}} valve timing to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> (called dual VANOS by BMW). Other upgrades included electronic throttle control (which uses a throttle cable as backup), a dual length intake manifold (called [...] "DISA" [...] by BMW) and revised cylinder liners.|$|E
50|$|The {{variable}} valve timing (VANOS) is a continuously variable design and is present on both the intake and exhaust camshafts. The VANOS units were designed as integral components of the chain drive, and the adjustment ranges are 63 degrees for the intake camshaft and 60 degrees for the <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft.</b> The redline for the N73 is 6500 rpm.|$|E
50|$|W4 :A {{water cooled}} 4-stroke {{overhead}} valve {{version of the}} W2. Separate inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts</b> ran in bronze bearings. The gear wheels to drive them were supplied ready-made. The four stroke crankshaft could only use ball bearings.|$|R
50|$|The S62 engine (also {{known as}} S62B50) is the {{high-performance}} {{variant of the}} M62, which is fitted to the E39 M5 and the E52 Z8. The S62 was BMW's first V8 engine to have variable valve timing on both the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts</b> (double-VANOS).|$|R
50|$|VarioCam is an {{automobile}} {{variable valve timing}} technology developed by Porsche. VarioCam varies {{the timing of the}} intake valves by adjusting the tension on the timing chain connecting the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts.</b> VarioCam was first used on the 1992 3.0 L engine in the Porsche 968.|$|R
50|$|An all new direct {{injection}} 5.0 L engine family {{was introduced in}} 2009 (all new engine block). New featuring: spray-guided direct-injection, continuously variable intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> timing. The naturally aspirated engines also feature cam profile switching and variable track length inlet manifold. Supercharged engines make use of a sixth-generation twin vortices supercharger. The 2010 model year engine conforms to EU5 and ULEV2 emissions regulations.|$|E
50|$|VVT-iE (Variable Valve Timing - {{intelligent}} by Electric motor) is {{a version}} of Dual VVT-i that uses an electrically operated actuator to adjust and maintain intake camshaft timing. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> timing is still controlled using a hydraulic actuator. This form of variable valve timing technology was developed initially for Lexus vehicles. This system was first introduced on the 2007MY Lexus LS 460 as 1UR engine.|$|E
50|$|The Series 2 Interceptor {{engine was}} a major {{redesign}} of the Series 1A engine. It included a wet sump engine to improve oil flow to the crankshaft. The CB points were moved {{to the end of}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> and the timing cover was redesigned accordingly. This engine was used on the Interceptor until the end of production in 1970. This engine was later used on Rickman Interceptor and Clymer Enfields.|$|E
50|$|More {{than two}} {{overhead}} camshafts {{are not known}} to have been tried in a production engine. However, MotoCzysz has designed a motorcycle engine with a triple overhead camshaft configuration, with the intake ports descending through the cylinder head to two central intake ports between two outside <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts</b> actuating one of two exhaust valves per cylinder each.|$|R
50|$|Compared {{with its}} M62 predecessor, the N62 also has {{variable}} valve timing on both the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts</b> (double-VANOS). As per the M62, the N62 has 4 valves per cylinder, an aluminium block, an aluminium head and fracture-split forged powdered metal connecting rods. The redline is 6500 rpm. Unlike its predecessor and successor, there was no M version of the N62.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, {{the fifth}} and {{final version of the}} 3S-GE was released, found only in the Japanese-delivered Altezza RS200. The 'Black Top' as it came to be {{referred}} to as, was fitted with a dual VVT-i system that adjusted timing on both intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts</b> and came in two different spec levels dependent on which transmission it was coupled to.|$|R
50|$|A single {{timing belt}} drives the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> {{along with the}} oil and water pumps. The cam journal is {{supported}} on 5 points between the valve lifters of each cylinder and {{on the front of}} the cylinder head. The cam journals are lubricated by oiler port located in the middle of the camshaft. To adjust the valve clearance in the first two generations, a shim over bucket system is employed. In the following generations a shim under bucket system is used.|$|E
50|$|These {{engines are}} a distant {{relative}} to the F-series engines found in the mid 1990s Honda Accord and Prelude. To get most out of the compact sized engine, Honda engineers utilized technology derived from Honda's racing engines. The F20C and F22C1 have two overhead cams with roller followers, a ladder-frame main bearing stiffener, a VTEC system for both the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft,</b> Fiber-Reinforced Metal cylinder liners (FRM), molybdenum disulfide-coated piston skirts for reduced friction, and use a timing chain.|$|E
50|$|The OM 668 {{makes use}} of the common rail system. Compared to the otto engine M 166 it has four valves per {{cylinder}} instead of two. Two chain driven overhead camshafts are used. The intake camshaft is driven by a chain, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> {{is connected to the}} intake camshaft with a gear. Another chain drives the oil pump from the crankshaft. All engines have a turbocharger and all engines with more than 44 kW power also have an intercooler. In 1997 the OM 668 was the smallest diesel engine by Mercedes-Benz.|$|E
50|$|The second {{generation}} Vios {{was introduced to}} China in 2008. The only major difference of the Vios in China is that the larger capacity models are powered by the new 1.6L 1ZR-FE engine with Dual VVT-i. The new Dual VVT-i engine system adjusts timing on both intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts</b> which results in superior performance, excellent fuel economy and lower emissions.|$|R
50|$|MIVEC (Mitsubishi Innovative Valve timing Electronic Control system) is {{the brand}} name of a {{variable}} valve timing (VVT) engine technology developed by Mitsubishi Motors. MIVEC, as with other similar systems, varies {{the timing of the}} intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts</b> which increases the power and torque output over a broad engine speed range while also being able to help spool a turbocharger more quickly and accurately.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, {{players can}} modify {{any part of}} their vehicle using a dynamic garage system. Like the cars, the parts are fictional, and are {{supplied}} by the game's fictional parts developer SL Tuners. In particular, the many engine components are highly modifiable, including intake, <b>exhausts,</b> <b>camshafts,</b> crankshafts, engine blocks, intake manifolds, cylinder heads, and turbochargers. Parts can be mixed and matched to create unique engines.|$|R
50|$|The 2.0L Zetec Inline-4 {{used in the}} 1998-2003 Ford Escort ZX2, Ford Contour, and 99-02 Mercury Cougar used VCT on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft.</b> The 2002-2004 SVT Focus (ST170 in Europe) also {{featured}} VCT, but on the intake camshaft of its {{modified version of the}} 2.0L Zetec engine. In addition, the 1.7L Zetec-S engine found in the European Ford Puma was equipped with variable camshaft timing. The 6.2L V8 introduced in the 2010 SVT Raptor also uses VCT. That motor has a single cam per bank, so it is dual-equal variable cam timing.|$|E

A thermostatically controlled electric cooling fan also became standard, replacing the engine-driven viscous fans on earlier cars. This not only provided forced airflow for the engine coolant radiator, but also for the smaller engine oil cooler.|$|E
50|$|Based on the PSA DW10 {{engine and}} with a {{capacity}} of 1997 cc, this engine was developed by Peugeot engineers in France on behalf of both PSA and Ford Motor Company. Production is currently taking place in France and Skövde in Sweden. The engine was released to Ford models in 2005 Ford Focus, and followed in the 2007 Mk IV Mondeo. It features a 16-valve cylinder head with twin belt driven camshafts (inlet camshaft connected to cambelt with <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshaft</b> indirectly linked via a timing chain) and utilises a variable geometry turbocharger with overboost function. An intercooler is always present, as opposed to some applications of its predecessor.|$|E
50|$|Continuous VVT {{was adopted}} {{for the first}} time. Featured on both the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts,</b> each can be varied through a range of 40 degrees. The twin spark plug system was {{replaced}} by a regular single spark plug per cylinder. New electronic coolant flow control has replaced the mechanical thermostat for improved engine warm-up and optimum control of engine temperature. Also tumble flaps are used to improve output at low engine speeds.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Mercedes-Benz built a 3.5-litre M-291 flat-12 engine for {{endurance}} racing. This engine employed a clever cylinder-head design with exhaust ports where the intake ports {{would normally be}} (on top of the engine, pointing upwards). The intake ports are between the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts,</b> just above the spark-plugs, pointing at an outward angle from the vertical. Putting the exhaust system on top, rather than underneath, allowed the engine to ride much lower in the engine-bay of the C-291 (and later C-292).|$|R
5000|$|The 2GR-FKS {{combines}} the D-4S {{system from the}} 2GR-FSE with the simulated on-demand Atkinson cycle used in the 2UR-GSE and 8AR-FTS engines. The intake camshafts are equipped with VVT-iW and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>camshafts</b> are equipped with VVT-i. In the Tacoma the engine specifications are [...] at 6000 rpm and [...] at 4600 rpm. In the Lexus RX 350 the engine specifications are [...] at 6300 rpm and [...] at 4700 rpm respectively.In the Lexus GS350 the engine specifications are [...] at 6600 rpm and [...] at 4800 rpm respectively.|$|R
