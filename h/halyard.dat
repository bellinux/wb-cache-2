5|$|At {{almost the}} same time as Chesapeake lost control of her helm, her fore-topsail <b>halyard</b> was shot away, her fore-topsail yard then dropped, and she 'luffed up'. Losing her forward momentum, she yawed further into the wind until she was 'in irons', her sails were pressed back against her masts and she then made {{sternway}} (went backwards). Her port stern quarter (rear left corner) made contact with Shannons starboard side, level with the fifth gunport from the bow, and Chesapeake was caught by the projecting fluke of one of Shannons anchors, which had been stowed on the gangway. Chesapeakes spanker boom then swung over the deck of the British ship. Mr Stevens, Broke's boatswain, lashed the boom inboard to keep the two ships together, and lost an arm as he did so.|$|E
5|$|During World War II in Yugoslavia, the United States {{initially}} {{supported the}} royal government of Yugoslavia. When the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia {{in the spring}} of 1941, the United States decisively supported the Chetniks {{in the first years of}} the war. This support took place in the form of extensive clandestine relations between the Office of Strategic Services and Chetniks with William Donovan's administration. Such cooperation was highlighted by complex operations such as Operation <b>Halyard,</b> in which several hundred American pilots were rescued by Chetniks. However, OSS support for the Chetniks was compromised by the United Kingdom's MI6 policy of favoring the Yugoslav Partisans over the Chetniks. In 1943, the US government's support for the Chetniks over the Yugoslav Partisans was such that president Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed with Winston Churchill in a private conversation that he imagined that Yugoslavia's boundaries would be completely redrawn into three separate states, with Peter Karađorđević Jr. being the monarch of an independent Serbian kingdom at the end of the war. The USAF and the British RAF began bombing Belgrade indiscriminately in April 1944 when they thought that Nazi occupation could not be removed by home-grown resistance alone. The United States intelligence circles gradually conceded its influence on Yugoslav guerrilla operations to the British. At the end of the war, President Harry S. Truman dedicated a Legion of Merit to Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović, but the award wasn't revealed publicly until 2005.|$|E

25|$|Currently, {{the flag}} is {{one and a}} half times wider than its height (i.e. in the {{proportion}} 2:3) and, except in the French navy, has stripes of equal width. Initially, the three stripes of the flag were not equally wide, being in the proportions 30 (blue), 33 (white) and 37 (red). Under Napoleon I, the proportions were changed to make the stripes' width equal, but by a regulation dated 17 May 1853, the navy went back to using the 30:33:37 proportions, which it now continues to use, as the flapping of the flag makes portions farther from the <b>halyard</b> seem smaller.|$|E

25|$|In July 1944, Vasić and {{his wife}} met with Richard Felman and other American pilots, whose B-24 Liberators were shot down by the Germans near the Serbian village of Pranjani. Vasić told Felman that the Chetniks would do {{everything}} {{in their power to}} protect the downed airmen and explained that the Germans had discovered the wreckage of Felman's plane. Vasić told him that they had recovered the body of a dead American pilot and assigned a young Chetnik named Miodrag Stefanović to be Felman's bodyguard. Felman was one of several hundred American airmen who were rescued by the Chetniks during Operation <b>Halyard,</b> and he spent much of his life speaking fervantly about the debt he owed to the Chetniks.|$|E
25|$|When George Musulin {{organized}} the 1944 final rescue of 500 American airmen called Operation <b>Halyard,</b> Draža Mihailović sent a political mission to Bari, Italy aboard an American plane.

At the Bari stopover, Ivan Šubašić, who signed the Treaty of Vis, {{also known as the}} Tito-Šubašić Agreement, earlier that year, met with the members of Mihailović's political mission but the Prime Minister-in-exile said nothing about the agreement he signed months earlier compromising the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Pribićević and his team remained in the West after the war ended, like thousands of other soldiers who managed to escape.|$|E
25|$|The Mayflower {{departed}} Plymouth, England on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot {{ship had}} 102 passengers and {{a crew of}} about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined {{with a lack of}} proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way, there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come. After arriving at their destination, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in the cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter. During the voyage there was a turbulent storm during which John Howland fell overboard. He managed to grab a topsail <b>halyard</b> that was trailing in the water and was hauled back aboard safely.|$|E

25|$|Sea shanties are {{a type of}} work song {{traditionally}} sung by sailors. Derived {{from the}} French word 'chanter', meaning 'to sing', they may date from {{as early as the}} 15th century, but most recorded examples derive from the 19th century. Shanties were usually slow rhythmic songs designed to help with collective tasks on labour-intensive sailing and later steam ships. Many were call and response songs, with one voice (the shantyman) singing a lead line {{and the rest of the}} sailors giving a response together. There were derived from varied sources, including dances, folk songs, polkas, waltzes and even West African work-songs. Since different songs were useful for different tasks they are traditionally divided into three main categories, short haul shanties, for tasks requiring quick pulls over a relatively short time; <b>halyard</b> shanties, for heavier work requiring more set-up time between pulls; and Capstan shanties, for long, repetitive tasks requiring a sustained rhythm, but not involving working the lines. Famous shanties include, the 'Drunken Sailor' and 'Blow the Man Down'. There was some interest in sea shanties in the first revival from figures like Percy Grainger. In the second revival A. L. Lloyd attempted to popularise them, recording several albums of sea songs from 1965.|$|E
25|$|A Gin Pennant {{means that}} the wardroom is {{inviting}} officers from ships in company to drinks. The origins of the Gin Pennant are uncertain, {{but it seems to}} have been used since the 1940s and probably earlier. Originally it was a small green triangular pennant measuring approximately , defaced with a white wine glass, nowadays the gin pennant is a Starboard pennant defaced with a wine or cocktail glass. Its colour, size and position when hoisted were all significant as the aim was for the pennant to be as inconspicuous as possible, thereby having fewer ships sight it and subsequently accept the invitation for drinks. The Gin Pennant is still in regular use by Commonwealth Navies, such as the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Within the RAN it is common practice, whilst in port, for junior officers of one ship to attempt to raise the Gin Pennant on the <b>halyard</b> of another ship, thereby forcing that ship to put on free drinks for the officers of the ship that managed to raise the pennant. If, however the junior officers are caught raising the pennant, then it is their ship that must put on free drinks within their Wardroom. Usually this practice is restricted to Commonwealth Navies; however, prior to increased force protection, RAN officers have successfully raised the Gin Pennant on a number of units in the USN.|$|E
500|$|Leaving port {{with a broad}} {{white flag}} bearing the motto [...] "Free Trade and Sailors' Rights", Chesapeake met with Shannon near 5pm that afternoon. During six minutes of firing, each ship managed two full {{broadside}}s. Chesapeakes first broadside was fired while the ship was heeling, causing most hits on Shannon to strike the water or waterline causing little damage to Shannon although carronade fire caused serious damage to Shannons rigging. A second round of fire was more effective, landing hits on Shannon 's 12 pounder shot locker. Chesapeake 's 32 lb carronades punished Shannons forecastle, killing three men, wounding others and disabling Shannon 's nine pounder bow gun. However Chesapeake suffered far more heavily in the exchange as accurate British fire caused heavy losses among American gun crews and crippling losses {{to the men and}} officers on Chesapeakes quarterdeck. A succession of helmsmen were killed and her wheel itself was destroyed. At the same time, her foretopsail <b>halyard</b> was shot away causing the ship to lose maneuverability.|$|E

500|$|At Boston, Captain James Lawrence took {{command of}} Chesapeake on 20 May 1813, and on 1 June, put to sea {{to meet the}} waiting HMS Shannon, {{commanded}} by Captain Philip Broke, the frigate whose written challenge had just missed Chesapeakes sailing. Chesapeake suffered early in the exchange of gunfire, having her wheel and fore topsail <b>halyard</b> shot away, rendering her unmanoeuvrable. Lawrence himself was mortally wounded and was carried below. The American crew, struggled {{to carry out their}} captain's last order, [...] "Don't give up the ship!", but the British boarding party overwhelmed them. The battle was notably intense but of short duration, lasting ten to fifteen minutes, in which time 252 men were killed or wounded. Shannons captain was severely injured in fighting on the forecastle. Chesapeake and her crew were taken to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where the sailors were imprisoned; the ship was repaired and taken into service by the Royal Navy. She was sold at Portsmouth, England in 1819 and broken up. Surviving timbers were used to build the nearby Chesapeake Mill in Wickham and can be seen and visited to this day. Shannon survived longer, being broken up in 1859.|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 19 November 1941, Sydney was {{off the coast of}} Western Australia, near Carnarvon, and heading south towards Fremantle. Around 15:55, the cruiser spotted a merchant ship on a northbound course, which quickly turned away from the coast at [...] Sydney increased speed to [...] and made to intercept. As she closed the gap, Sydney began to signal the unidentified merchantman, first by signal light, then after no reply was forthcoming and the distance between the two ships had decreased, by a combination of light and signal flag. The merchant ship hoisted her callsign, but as she was ahead and just port of Sydney, the flags were obscured by the funnel. A request from the cruiser that the merchant ship make her signal letters clear, which the signals officer did by lengthening the <b>halyard</b> and swinging the flags clear. The callsign was that of the Dutch ship Straat Malakka, but she was not on Sydneys list of ships meant to be in the area. Further flag signals were exchanged between the ships, with Sydney asking the Dutch ship's destination and cargo.|$|E

Shortly afterward Lion lost her remaining dynamo to the rising water which knocked out all remaining light and power. He ordered [...] "Course north-east" [...] at 11:02 to bring his ships back to their pursuit of Hipper. He also hoisted [...] "Attack the rear of the enemy" [...] on the other <b>halyard</b> although there was no connection between the two signals.

Beatty tried to correct the mistake, but he was so far behind the leading battlecruisers that his signals could not be read amidst the smoke and haze.|$|E

2500|$|Modern shanties {{were used}} to {{accompany}} work at the patent windlass, {{which was designed to}} raise anchor and was operated by the see-saw like action of pumping hand brakes. The up and down motion of the brake levers lent the action a binary form that was well-suited by many of the same songs used as <b>halyard</b> shanties. And yet, the continuous nature of the task also meant grand choruses were possible. So while <b>halyard</b> shanties and capstan shanties tended to be exclusive of one another, windlass shanties sometimes shared repertoire with each of those other types.
