50|$|Among the {{two types}} of silicon steel, {{grain-oriented}} (GO) and grain non-oriented (GNO), GO is most desirable for magnetic cores. It is anisotropic, offering better magnetic properties than GNO in one direction. As the magnetic field in inductor and transformer cores is always along the same direction, it is an advantage to use <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> <b>steel</b> in the preferred orientation. Rotating machines, where the direction of the magnetic field can change, gain no benefit from grain-oriented steel.|$|E

40|$|Inductor or reactor or {{sometimes}} called as ‘Choke’ as per its intended situational assignment, {{is a basic}} magnetic component which is very useful for many fields {{and particularly in the}} fields of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. Amongst its endless applications in the fields, inductors functions in the low frequency range such as the power system frequencies (i. e. 50 Hz, 60 Hz) are considered mainly in this research. Main concern {{of this paper is to}} popularize toroidal steel core inductor construction which is advantages in many aspects over the common other types of inductors such as EI laminated and C-Core constructions. Conventionally for toroidal silicon steel core inductors, cores are constructed with magnetically <b>Grain</b> <b>Oriented</b> Silicon <b>Steel</b> (GOSS). This paper describes a methodological approach to find out the suitability of magnetically Non <b>Grain</b> <b>Oriented</b> Silicon <b>Steel</b> (NGOSS) for the inductor core material. A comparative study is carried out selecting inductor designs made with <b>Grain</b> <b>Oriented</b> Silicon <b>Steel</b> (GOSS) and their corresponding Non <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> silicon <b>steel</b> (NGOSS) ones. Comparisons of the designs with regards to their electrical, thermal characteristics are primarily carried out and the economical viability of these inductors with proposed steel type is also verified in this dissertation. Analyzed results shows the advantages of using Non <b>Grain</b> <b>Oriented</b> Silicon <b>Steel</b> (NGOSS) for inductor designs over its cost considerations and at the same time matching performances of the conversional <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> types. To have the best optimized outcome from the proposed new steel type for inductor manufacturing, it is necessary to incorporate characteristics of non grain electrical silicon steel to inductor design programs and such program is proposed and developed towards the end of this dissertation...|$|R

40|$|Characteristic {{features}} of microstructure in secondary recrystallized <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> silicon <b>steel</b> containing MnS and AIN have been investigated. Since secondary recrystallization is markedly influenced by inhibitors {{and a small}} amount of solute elements, transmission electron microscopy has been used to characterize changes of the morphology of inhibitors by tin addition. The onset temperature of secondary recrystallization of the silicon stcel is shown to be decreased by tin addition. Also tin addition tends {{to reduce the size of}} inhibitors, MnS and AIN, and thereby appears to reduce the size of primary recrystallized grains. These effects of tin addition on microstructure are consistent with the fundamental idea that reduction of the size of primary recrystallized grains generally decreases the onset temperature of the secondary recrystallization. Electron back scattering pattern measurement was also conducted to characterize microscopic texture of recrystallized grains.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the copper content, initial structure, and scheme of {{treatment}} on the magnetic properties of an ultra-thin <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> electrical <b>steel</b> has been investigated. In the material with copper and an initial sharp texture, the nucleation of new grains upon primary recrystallization is connected with deformation twins; in the samples without copper and with copper and diffuse texture, it is connected predominantly with shear bands and transition bands. Upon heating {{at a rate of}} ∼ 0. 004 K/s, the temperature of primary recrystallization in the copper-bearing samples is considerably higher than in the copper-free material. Upon heating at a rate of ∼ 4 K/s the appearance of new grains occurs almost simultaneously for all of the studied samples. In the samples with copper and initial sharp texture after annealing at 1050 C, {{a significant part of the}} volume is occupied by grains that had undergone normal grain growth; in the samples without copper and with copper and diffuse texture, anomalous growth is hardly observed at all. To obtain high final magnetic properties of the ultra-thin <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> electrical <b>steel</b> produced by the Littmann method, it has been suggested to use an <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> electrical <b>steel</b> with 0. 5 % Cu that exhibits the diffuse orientation of grains as the workpiece. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Localised {{magnetic}} flux density, magnetising field and power loss {{are believed to}} distribute non-uniformly in <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> electrical <b>steel.</b> Understanding {{of the causes of}} their variation can help reduce the overall power loss of the material. In this investigation, magnetic domain observation was often used in the study of domain configuration and crystal orientation of the test specimens. Methods of domain observation have been studied and compared in order to select the appropriate method for different parts of the investigation and to improve the understanding of the image observed. A less destructive local loss measurement sensor has been built for the measurement of localised flux density, magnetising field and power loss. The sensor was tested and evaluated specifically for the measurement of localised magnetic power loss of the high permeability <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> electrical <b>steel.</b> The results obtained from local loss scanning measurements indicated that localised flux density and magnetising field can vary substantially in <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> electrical <b>steel</b> under AC magnetisation of 50 Hz. The variation of localised flux density has been found mainly resulted by grain misorientation and local grain arrangement. The transverse component of flux density was detected and has been found increases with increasing grain misorientation. The variation of localised magnetising field has been found mainly influenced by the localised demagnetising field due to formation of free magnetic poles at grain boundaries. It has been proved that both flux density and magnetising field have strong influence on the distribution of localised power loss. The study of the effect of domain refinement on distribution of localised flux density showed that domain refinement by means of ball scribing on one surface of <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> electrical <b>steel</b> can improve the uniformity of distribution of flux density. However, results also inferred that excessive scribing in a confined area can cause obvious uneven distribution of flux density {{in the direction of the}} specimen’s thickness...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we studied}} the {{influence}} of thermal effect on the iron loss components by DC and AC magnetic measurement. The measured result shows that iron loss of nonoriented silicon steel is more influenced by temperature than <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> one. Based on loss separation model, we have found a suitable iron loss expression for nonoriented and <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> <b>steels.</b> Then a temperature dependent iron loss model is proposed, where temperature coefficient k is introduced to consider thermal effect on dynamic loss. The iron loss model is validated by all series of silicon steel stripe made by WISCO. The relative error of the model is about 11 % {{in a wide range}} of 20 ∼ 400 Hz, 20 ∼ 200 °C, 0 ∼ 2 T.

The developed method gives possible to make calculation of the flux density and influence of skin effect {{in different parts of}} the magnetic cores of distribution transformer, where are used mix of <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> (GO) and non <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> (NGO) <b>steels.</b> Was determinate the general basic conditions for the calculation of flux density in the laminations from grain and non <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> <b>steels</b> of the magnetic core: the strength of magnetic field for the laminations of particular part of mixed core is the same; the sum of the magnetic fluxes in GO and NGO steels in particular part of mixed core is equal with the designed magnetic flux in this part of mixed core. Discover, the magnetic flux in mixed core of the transformer has specific distribution between magnetic steels. The flux density is higher in laminations from GO steel and smaller in laminations from the NGO steel. That is happened because for magnetic flux is easier pass through laminations from GO steel, what has better magnetic conductance than laminations from NGO steel. Originality.

40|$|AbstractThe {{efficiency}} of power transformers should be always taken in account when design and operation conditions parameters are chosen. In high temperature superconducting transformers (HTS transformers), normally cooled by liquid nitrogen at 77 K, cores are usually kept {{at room temperature}} {{in order to minimize}} total magnetic losses, losing the possibility to use the cooling liquid to minimize electric risks and to cool the core, and increasing the complexity of the cryostats that, in these cases, must only embrace the superconducting windings.

40|$|Effective {{magnetic}} shielding from DC to power frequencies is of growing importance in many applications. Electrical steel {{is often used}} as a shielding material since it offers a cost effective solution over this frequency range. There is no standard or commonly accepted approach to measuring the shielding capabilities of different grades of sheet materials or accurately assessing their effectiveness in practical applications. This paper briefly reviews recent experimental approaches to measuring the shielding factors of electrical steels. Research results obtained from one type of simple test system are presented to show the dependence of the shielding factors of electrical steel panels on thickness and relative permeability. Multiple-layer shielding is often advocated and its effectiveness, {{in the case of}} <b>grain</b> <b>oriented</b> <b>steel,</b> is demonstrated. Depending on the application, the selection of shielding material based on typical B-H curves presented by manufacturers can be misleading so a clearer understanding of specific material properties which control the shielding effectiveness is needed.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of individual core losses of wound core distribution transformers (T/Fs) {{is very important}} because these constitute {{one of the main}} parameters of their quality and moreover core costs represent about 30 % of the total T/F is very important because these constitute one of the main parameters of their quality and moreover core costs represent about 30 % of the total T/F material cost. In addition, accurate calculations of individual core actual losses is extremely difficult, since actual losses show a divergence up to +/- 20 %, in relation with the theoretical individual core losses.

Domain refinement techniques like mechanical scratching, laser scribing or plasma flame can be applied after the process of rolling {{in order to reduce}} the core losses due to mechanical or thermal stress that refines the magnetic domains. The most commonly used techniques is laser scribing due to its no-contact nature and the slight damage to the surface coating [1]. Therewith, the core losses can be reduced by typically 10 %. However, after the annealing of laser domain refined material, the induced thermal stress is removed and the effect of the improvement of the {{magnetic properties}} is reduced dramatically [2].
