5|$|After {{her mother}} {{announced}} {{she would not}} run for re-election in 2014, Davis filed as a <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> for county clerk. At a candidates' forum, Davis stated {{she felt she was}} best qualified for the position because of her 26 years of experience in the clerk's office.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, Davis {{first became}} {{involved}} in politics when he attended a Democratic Party meeting in Vicksburg and, to his surprise, was chosen as a delegate to the party's state convention in Jackson. In 1842, he attended the Democratic convention, and, in 1843, became a <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> for the state House of Representatives from the Warren County-Vicksburg district; he lost his first election. In 1844, Davis {{was sent to the}} party convention for a third time, and his interest in politics deepened. He was selected as one of six presidential electors for the 1844 presidential election and campaigned effectively throughout Mississippi for the <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> James K. Polk.|$|E
5|$|Gingrich {{sought a}} rematch against Flynt in 1976. While the Republicans did {{slightly}} {{better in the}} 1976 House elections than in 1974 nationally, the <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> in the 1976 presidential election was former Governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter. Carter won {{more than two-thirds of}} the vote in his native Georgia. Gingrich lost his race by 5,100 votes.|$|E

5|$|In April 1892, Clayton {{was under}} {{consideration}} as a <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> {{for a long}} term on the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. At the West Virginia Democratic Party State Convention in August 1892, held in Parkersburg, Marmaduke H. Dent was elected as the party's candidate for election to the long term, beating out Clayton, Joseph Moreland, and Robert W. Monroe.|$|E
5|$|In September 1923, Democratic gubernatorial nominee J. Campbell Cantrill died, {{leaving the}} party without a candidate. Alben Barkley, who Cantrill had {{defeated}} for the nomination, {{refused to be}} the <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate,</b> perhaps because he had already {{decided to run for}} the U.S. Senate in 1926. The Democratic Central Committee chose Fields as a replacement for Cantrill.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma {{has been}} {{politically}} conservative {{for much of}} its history, especially recently. During the first half century of statehood, it was considered a Democratic stronghold, being carried by the Republican Party in only two presidential elections (1920 and 1928). During this time, it was also carried by every winning <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> up to Harry Truman. However, Oklahoma Democrats were {{generally considered to be}} more conservative than Democrats in other states.|$|E

50|$|Shoshone County was {{historically}} a Democratic-leaning county, but {{in recent}} years has voted for Republican presidential <b>candidates,</b> while favoring <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidates</b> locally and statewide. The county polled a majority for <b>Democratic</b> Gubernatorial <b>candidate</b> Jerry Brady and <b>Democratic</b> Senatorial <b>candidate</b> Larry LaRocco, but Barack Obama lost in 2008 by an eight-point margin.|$|R
5|$|Preckwinkle {{nominated}} Joseph Berrios {{for re-election}} as Chairman of the Democratic Party of Cook County {{at a meeting}} of the Cook County Democratic Central Committee on March 3, 2010. At the time Berrios was the incumbent chairman as well as a commissioner with the Cook County Board of Review and the <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> for Cook County Assessor. Berrios was re-elected.|$|E
5|$|After Kerr's death, Randall was the {{consensus}} {{choice of the}} Democratic caucus, and {{was elected to the}} Speakership when Congress returned to Washington on December 2, 1876. He assumed the chair at a tumultuous time, as the presidential election had just concluded the previous month with no clear winner. The <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate,</b> Samuel J. Tilden of New York, had 184 electoral votes, just shy of the 185 needed for victory. Rutherford B. Hayes, the Republican, had 163; the remaining 22 votes were in doubt.|$|E
5|$|Brunner's term as Ohio Secretary of State ends in 2011 and {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 2010 along with other Ohio statewide offices. In January, rumors that were eventually confirmed began circulating that second term Republican United States Senator George Voinovich would not run {{for re-election}} in 2010. Brunner's name was mentioned as a potential <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> for the seat. On January 23, 2009, Brunner and Ohio Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher met to discuss the possibility that either of them would run, but did not confirm any decision or leanings to the media.|$|E

5|$|Despite the state's general Republican and {{conservative}} leanings, Democrats have found success in various statewide elections, {{most notably in}} those involving South Dakota's congressional representatives in Washington. American Indians have been becoming more active in state and county electoral politics. In the 2002 election, American Indian voting carried Tim Johnson as the <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> {{by a margin of}} 532 votes. Until his electoral defeat in 2004, Senator Tom Daschle was the Senate minority leader (and briefly its majority leader during Democratic control of the Senate in 2001–02).|$|E
5|$|Following {{the custom}} of the times—that {{candidates}} not appear to seek the office—Tyler stayed home throughout the campaign, and made no speeches. Tyler received only 47 electoral votes, from Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee, in the November 1836 election, trailing both Granger and the <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate,</b> Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky. Harrison was the leading Whig candidate for president, but he lost to Van Buren. The presidential election was settled by the Electoral College, but for {{the only time in}} American history, the vice presidential election was decided by the Senate, which selected Johnson over Granger on the first ballot.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Kentucky Democrats {{nominated}} Linn Boyd for governor, but Boyd {{declined the}} nomination. Powell {{was chosen to}} replace Boyd on the ticket, {{largely due to the}} influence of James Guthrie. The Whig party nominated Senator John J. Crittenden, and the race was complicated by former Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson's announcement that he would run as an independent <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate.</b> Knowing the Democrats' chances were dimmed by having two candidates in the race, Powell arranged a meeting with Johnson, following which the latter withdrew his candidacy and pledged his support to Powell. Nevertheless, Crittenden won the election.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{never gave}} up on a return to public service. He ran an {{unsuccessful}} campaign for the U.S. Senate against John J. Crittenden in 1842. He briefly and futilely sought his party's nomination for president in 1844. He also ran as an independent candidate for Governor of Kentucky in 1848, but after talking with the <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate,</b> Lazarus W. Powell, who had replaced Linn Boyd on the ticket, Johnson decided to drop out and back Powell. Some speculated that the real object of this campaign was to secure another nomination to the vice-presidency, but this hope was denied.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{defeated}} Native American activist Russell Means at the Libertarian Party's National Convention in Seattle {{to win the}} party's presidential nomination. Former Alaska State representative Andre Marrou {{was selected}} as his running mate. After over a year of campaigning as the Libertarian Party nominee, Paul received very little media coverage, and was excluded from presidential debates. On Election Day, {{he was on the}} ballot in 46 states and the District of Columbia, and finished in third place with approximately 0.47% of the vote, behind <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> Michael Dukakis and the winner Vice President George H.W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|Swisher was {{an active}} member of the West Virginia Democratic Party. In 1900, he was {{selected}} as a candidate for State Superintendent of Free Schools. In the 1902 general election, he ran as the <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> for the Eleventh District of the West Virginia State Senate. Despite his loss, Swisher received the largest number of Democratic votes ever amassed in Monongalia County up until that time. Swisher was a delegate at the 1936 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, and was selected as an alternate delegate to the Democratic National Conventions of 1912 and 1924.|$|E

5|$|The Crisis carried editorials by Du Bois that {{supported}} the ideals of unionized labor but excoriated the racism demonstrated by its leaders, who systematically excluded blacks from membership. Du Bois also supported {{the principles of the}} Socialist Party (he was briefly a member of the party from 1910 to 1912), but he denounced the racism demonstrated by some socialist leaders.Lewis, p. 275 (denounced). Frustrated by Republican president Taft's failure to address widespread lynching, Du Bois endorsed <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 presidential race, in exchange for Wilson's promise to support black causes.|$|E
5|$|The party split grew, and in 1912, Taft and Roosevelt were rivals for the Republican nomination. The 1912 Republican National Convention was bitterly divided. At Taft's request, Harding gave {{a speech}} nominating the president, but the angry delegates were not {{receptive}} to Harding's oratory. Taft was renominated, but Roosevelt supporters bolted the party. Harding, as a loyal Republican, supported Taft. The Republican vote was split between Taft, the party's official candidate, and Roosevelt, running under the label of the Progressive Party. This allowed the <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate,</b> New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson, to be elected.|$|E
5|$|Although {{given the}} first name Lewis, Willkie was known from {{childhood}} by his middle name. Herman Willkie, who had come from Prussia with his parents at age four, was intensely involved in progressive politics, and in 1896 took his sons to a torchlight procession for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan, {{who had come to}} Elwood during his campaign. The Willkie boys had a sidewalk fight with Republican youths, and though the Willkies won their battle, Bryan did not, defeated by former Ohio governor William McKinley. When Bryan ran again in 1900, he stayed overnight at the Willkie home, and the <b>Democratic</b> <b>candidate</b> for president became the first political hero for the boy who would later seek that office.|$|E
