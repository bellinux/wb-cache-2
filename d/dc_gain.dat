25|$|Finite bandwidth: All {{amplifiers}} have finite bandwidth. To a first approximation, the op-amp has {{the frequency}} response of an integrator with gain. That is, the gain {{of a typical}} op-amp is inversely proportional to frequency and is characterized by its gain–bandwidth product(GBWP).

This dynamic response coupled with the very high <b>DC</b> <b>gain</b> of the op-amp gives it {{the characteristics of a}} first-order low-pass filter with very high <b>DC</b> <b>gain</b> and low cutoff frequency given by the GBWP divided by the DC gain.The finite bandwidth of an op-amp can be the source of several problems, including:Typical low-cost, general-purpose op-amps exhibit a GBWP of a few megahertz.

40|$|Abstract—Op-amps {{are crucial}} {{components}} in sigma–delta modulators (SDMs). As device dimensions and supply voltages continue to scale down, {{it is increasingly}} critical to determine a suitable op-amp <b>dc</b> <b>gain.</b> If the <b>dc</b> <b>gain</b> is set too high, then the op-amp consumes too much power; if the <b>dc</b> <b>gain</b> is too small, then nonlinear distortion becomes serious. However, there exists no efficient approach for selecting dc gains. In this brief, we propose to use a nonlinear function to model nonlinear op-amp <b>dc</b> <b>gain</b> curves. Then, this nonlinear function is employed to derive an SDM nonlinear distortion model {{as a function of}} SDM system parameters.
