5|$|Aldfrith ruled both Bernicia and Deira {{throughout}} his reign, {{but the two}} parts remained distinct, and would again be divided by the Vikings in the late 9th century. The centre of Bernicia lay in the region around the later Anglo-Scottish border, with Lindisfarne, Hexham, Bamburgh, and Yeavering being important religious and royal centres. Even after Ecgfrith's death, Bernicia included much of modern southeast Scotland, with a presumed royal centre at Dunbar, and religious centres at Coldingham and Melrose. The details of the early Middle Ages in northwest England and southwest Scotland are more obscure, but a Bishop of Whithorn is known from shortly after Aldfrith's reign. York, Catterick, Ripon, and Whitby appear to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>important</b> sites in Deira.|$|E

5|$|Historically, stars <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>important</b> to civilizations {{throughout}} the world. They {{have been part}} of religious practices and used for celestial navigation and orientation. Many ancient astronomers believed that stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped stars into constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the Sun. The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the horizon) was used to create calendars, which could be used to regulate agricultural practices. The Gregorian calendar, currently used nearly everywhere in the world, is a solar calendar based on the angle of the Earth's rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>important</b> in this regard. First is the emergency legislation passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the financial crisis on the country. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. The much larger foreign operations of the banks, however, went into receivership.|$|E
5|$|Naming and {{classifying}} our surroundings {{has probably}} been taking place as long as mankind {{has been able to}} communicate. It would always <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>important</b> to know the names of poisonous and edible plants and animals in order to communicate this information to other members of the family or group. Medicinal plant illustrations show up in Egyptian wall paintings from c. 1500 BC, indicating that the uses of different species were understood and that a basic taxonomy was in place.|$|E
5|$|The Edwardian castles {{also made}} strong {{symbolic}} {{statements about the}} nature of the new occupation. For example, Caernarvon was decorated with carved eagles, equipped with polygonal towers and expensive banded masonry, all designed to imitate the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, then the idealised image of imperial power. The actual site of the castle may also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>important</b> as it was positioned close to the former Roman fort of Segontium. The elaborate gatehouse, with an excessive five sets of doors and six portcullises, also appears to have been designed to impress visitors and to invoke an image of an Arthurian castle, then believed to have been Byzantine in character.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{origins of}} Styracosaurus were not understood {{for many years}} because fossil evidence for early ceratopsians was sparse. The discovery of Protoceratops, in 1922, shed light on early ceratopsid relationships, but several decades passed before additional finds filled in more of the blanks. Fresh discoveries in the late 1990s and 2000s, including Zuniceratops, the earliest known ceratopsian with brow horns, and Yinlong, the first known Jurassic ceratopsian, indicate what the ancestors of Styracosaurus may have looked like. These new discoveries <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>important</b> in illuminating the origins of horned dinosaurs in general, and suggest that the group originated during the Jurassic in Asia, {{with the appearance of}} true horned ceratopsians occurring {{by the beginning of the}} late Cretaceous in North America.|$|E
5|$|Beauty {{in nature}} has {{historically}} been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless. Nature and wildness <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>important</b> subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The tradition of representing nature as it is {{became one of the}} aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art.|$|E
5|$|In a 2010 {{review of}} Stegosaurus species, Peter Galton {{suggested}} that {{the arrangement of the}} plates on the back may have varied between species, and that the pattern of plates as viewed in profile may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>important</b> for species recognition. Galton noted that the plates in S. stenops have been found articulated in two staggered rows, rather than paired. Fewer S. ungulatus plates have been found, and none articulated, making the arrangement in this species more difficult to determine. However, the type specimen of S. ungulatus preserves two flattened spine-like plates from the tail that are nearly identical in shape and size, but are mirror images of each other, suggesting that at least these were arranged in pairs. Many of the plates are manifestly chiral and no two plates of the same size and shape have been found for an individual; however plates have been correlated between individuals. Well preserved integumentary impressions of the plates of Hesperosaurus show a smooth surface with long and parallel, shallow grooves. This indicates that the plates were covered in keratinous sheaths.|$|E

5|$|Many people <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>important</b> in {{the push}} to develop {{the game in the}} Cook Islands and raise the profile of the {{national}} netball team on the global stage. They include Anna Noovao, who was the captain of the 1992 New Zealand side, Margharet Matenga, who was the first Cook Islands player to play for New Zealand's national team, and Mamia, who was the secretary of the Cook Islands Netball Association for six years. Mamia was an umpire and an umpire examiner for the Oceania region. She attended South Pacific Games in Micronesia, the Commonwealth Games in Malaysia, and the Olympic Games in Sydney. Mamia was a national representative for teams that had competed in the South Pacific Games during the 1980s. Tina Pupuke Browne was president of the Cook Islands Netball Association. Elizabeth Tou was coach of the national team from 2005 to 2007. She represented the country as a player at Pacific Games, Commonwealth Games and the World Championships.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals {{have a large}} larynx {{and thus}} a {{low-pitched}} voice, namely the hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) where the larynx can take up {{the entirety of the}} thoracic cavity while pushing the lungs, heart, and trachea into the abdomen. Large vocal pads can also lower the pitch, as in the low-pitched roars of big cats. The production of infrasound is possible in some mammals such as the African elephant (Loxodonta spp.) and baleen whales. Small mammals with small larynxes have the ability to produced ultrasound, which can be detected by modifications to the middle ear and cochlea. Ultrasound is inaudible to birds and reptiles, which might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>important</b> during the Mesozoic, when birds and reptiles were the dominant predators. This private channel is used by some rodents in, for example, mother-to-pup communication, and by bats when echolocating. Toothed whales also use echolocation, but, as opposed to the vocal membrane that extends upward from the vocal folds, they have a melon to manipulate sounds. Some mammals, namely the primates, have air sacs attached to the larynx, which may function to increase the volume of sound.|$|E
5|$|There {{are more}} than 30 monuments in the early Maya style, which dates to the Late Preclassic, making it the most common style {{represented}} at Takalik Abaj. The great quantity of early Maya sculpture {{and the presence of}} early examples of Maya hieroglyphic writing suggest that the site played an important part in the development of Maya ideology. The origins of the Maya sculptural style may have developed in the Preclassic on the Pacific coast and Takalik Abaj's position at the nexus of key trade routes could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>important</b> in the dissemination of the style across the Maya area. The early Maya style of monument at Takalik Abaj is closely linked to the style of monument at Kaminaljuyu, showing mutual influence. This interlinked style spread to other sites that formed part of the extended trade network of which these two cities were the twin foci.|$|E
