25|$|Denmark is a {{representative}} democracy with universal suffrage. Membership of the <b>Folketing</b> {{is based on}} proportional representation of political parties, with a 2% electoral threshold. Danes elect 175 members to the <b>Folketing,</b> with Greenland and the Faroe Islands electing an additional two members each—179 members in total.

25|$|Greenland's minimal {{representation}} in the <b>Folketing</b> meant that despite 70.3% of Greenlanders rejecting entry into the European Common Market (EEC), it was pulled in along with Denmark in 1973. Fears that the customs union would allow foreign firms to compete and overfish its waters were quickly realized and the local parties began to push strongly for increased autonomy. The <b>Folketing</b> approved devolution in 1978 {{and the next year}} enacted home rule under a local Landsting. On 23 February 1982, a bare majority (53%) of Greenland's population voted to leave the EEC, a process which lasted until 1985.|$|E
