The building is four storeys high, with attics and sub-basements, and comprises long north and south ranges which are linked by two cross-ranges. The original plans intended for east and west ranges to be added, forming a rectangular plan; the east range was built 1921-22, but the west range was not built.Until around 1925 the building had its own power station, supplying electricity to passenger and <b>goods</b> <b>lifts,</b> printing presses and more than 11,000 lamps; the chimney, centred {{to the south of}} the building, is in the style of a campanile.Pevsner described the building as contributing to a [...] "curiously muddled area …its vast bulk not very convincingly dressed up with Wrenaissance trimmings." ...|$|E

50|$|He {{emigrated to}} Australia on the Champion of the Seas, {{arriving}} in Melbourne in June 1856.He {{set up a}} blacksmith's workshop in Flinders Lane, where he fabricated straightforward iron components such as posts for houses and bridges, as well as undertaking a range of construction jobs. Around 1870 he hired an engineer, Thomas Pearce, who had trade experience with Boulton & Watt of Birmingham. With Pearce as an assistant, they greatly expanded their capabilities and specialised in fabricating hydraulic lifts, which were increasingly being installed in multi-storey buildings. The workshop grew and in 1888 he floated Johns Hydraulic & General Engineering Co. as a public company. In 1892 they formed a consortium as Johns & Waygood to supply and install passenger and <b>goods</b> <b>lifts</b> to the new Metropolitan Gas Company building. In 1893 the company became Johns & Waygood Limited after taking over the Australian arm of the British Richard Waygood & Co. Johns, Pearce and Charles Lawson were board members and major shareholders, as were Thomas Bent and George Swinburne.|$|E
40|$|Generally, DC motors {{are given}} {{preference}} for industrial {{applications such as}} electric locomotives, cranes, <b>goods</b> <b>lifts.</b> Because of they have high starting moment; they initially start with high current. This high start-up current must be decreased since it may damage windings of the motor and increases power consumption. It could be controlled by an appropriate driver system and controller. The nature of fuzzy logic control has adaptive characteristics that can achieve robust response to a system with uncertainty, parameter variation, and load disturbance. In this paper, fuzzy logic based control of start-up current of a Buck-Boost Converter fed serial DC motor is examined through computer simulation. In order to see the advantages of fuzzy logic control, classical PI control has applied to the same motor, under same circumstances and has been compared. C++ Builder software {{has been used for}} the simulation. According to the simulation results, plainly, fuzzy logic control has stronger responses than classical PI control and uses lower current at starting moment...|$|E
40|$|In central Jönköping, on Munksjöns {{northern}} waterside {{a shopping}} centre will be built, {{on the block}} Atollen. The construction will begin in autumn of 2007 and will be finished according to plan in 2009. Atollens goal is to counteract the competition from external retailers and strengthen the retail trade in the city centre, leading to more attractive and competitive city centre. Atollen {{will not be a}} shopping centre in traditional style and design, it will be focused on shopping and experience. The shopping centre shall be a natural venue with a wide and exclusive store mix, concentrated against trend conscious customers. This will be created {{with the help of a}} futuristic design and architecture, with light, open and transparent spaces. Atollens central location and design have led to the choice of placing the receiving department in the shopping centres basement. This will lead to a more complex receiving department for Atollens units. The objective of this thesis is to analyse the receiving department and the internal logistics effects on sales and tenants ability to pay. To achieve the objective a status report has been established of Atollens commercial parts and the internal logistic flow, from plans and blueprints. The thesis work has been carried out with help of interviews, literature studies and visits to shopping centres in benchmarking purposes. The analysis of the receiving department and the internal logistics has been carried out from the areas garage entrance, receiving department, storage/depot and logistic walkway. The analysis has identified a number of problems that can arise in Atollen and potentially lead to a goods supply that is not optimal for the shopping centres units. The thesis works conclusion is based on how the authors consider the problems that can arise affect sales and tenants ability to pay in Atollen. The conclusion also presents recommendations of how to avoid that these problems arise. The recommendations involves delivery control, extension of logistic walkway, installation of <b>goods</b> <b>lifts,</b> displays and reference, delivery instructions, security and shop interior.

40|$|Aerodynamic {{predictions}} from supersonic linear {{theory and}} hypersonic impact theory {{were compared with}} experimental data for three hypersonic research airplane concepts over a Mach number range from 1. 10 to 2. 86.

The combined tangent-cone theory predictions were <b>good</b> for <b>lift</b> and fair to good for pitching moment for M more than or equal to 2. 0.

2500|$|The tower has thirty two lifts for tenants to use, where 8 lifts serve roughly ten {{floors of}} the building. All tenant {{passenger}} lifts serve the ground floor and the following groups of floors – floors 5–17, floors 18–28, floors 28–39 and floors 39–50 (note that level 5 is the first office floor {{and there is no}} level 13). In addition there are 2 firemen's lifts which serve all floors in the building. These have colour designations with blue being in the northeast core of the building and green being in the southwest. From the building's initial construction until late 2009 there were 2 large freight lifts at which point another was added. This lift was built inside a vacant lift shaft and has the designation GL37 (GL for <b>goods</b> <b>lift</b> and 37 as it is the 37th lift in the building). The tower uses 'Gearless Traction Elevators' by Otis. [...] These lifts were installed in 1990 (aside from GL37 – 2009) using a gearless traction machine. [...] They have woven steel cables called hoisting ropes that are attached {{to the top of the}} lift cabin and wrapped around the drive sheave in special grooves.
