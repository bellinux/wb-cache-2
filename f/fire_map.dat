40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{behavior}} of pulse- coupled integrate-and-fire oscillators. Each oscillator {{is characterized by a}} state evolving between two threshold values. As the state reaches the upper threshold, it is reset to the lower threshold and emits a pulse which increments by a constant value the state of every other oscillator. The behavior of the system is described by the so-called firing map: depending on the stability of the <b>firing</b> <b>map,</b> an important dichotomy characterizes {{the behavior of}} the oscillators (synchronization or clustering). The <b>firing</b> <b>map</b> is the composition of a linear map with a scalar nonlinearity. After briefly discussing the case of the scalar <b>firing</b> <b>map</b> (corresponding to two oscillators), the stability analysis is extended to the general n-dimensional <b>firing</b> <b>map</b> (for n+ 1 oscillators). Different models are considered (leaky oscillators, quadratic oscillators, [...] .), with a particular emphasis on the persistence of the dichotomy in higher dimension...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the efficacy of archived remotely sensed data to create historic fire maps, this study compares a remote sensing based wildland <b>fire</b> <b>map</b> with an historical fire database for California, USA. Fires occurring in two years (1996 and 1999) were mapped using data obtained from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor. A vector database of fire perimeters, compiled and maintained by the State of California was obtained as a source of comparison for the AVHRR based <b>fire</b> <b>map.</b> The two datasets were overlaid and spatially compared in seven land cover types and ten ecoregions. The sources of disagreement and overlap between the datasets were quantified in order to elucidate trends in fire detection algorithm performance over the land cover types and ecoregions. Various methods of vector based comparison were examined in order to more effectively describe the spatial relationships between the two fire maps. The results show that algorithm performance varies over both ecosystem type and geographic region of California. The remote sensing method was able to map between 62 % and 74 % (1999 and 1996, respectively) of fire area mapped in the State maintained database. There was between 40 % and 45 % (1999 and 1996, respectively) of geographic overlap in the datasets. The results illustrate the need to calibrate remotely sensed algorithms by ecosystem type and geographic location in order to more effectively produce historic <b>fire</b> <b>map</b> products for research and other purposes...|$|E
40|$|Pulse coupled neural {{networks}} (PCNN) is a mammal visual cortex-inspired artificial {{neural networks}}. Owing to the coupling links in neurons, PCNN is successful {{to utilize the}} local information, thus it has been successfully employed in image fusion. However, in traditional PCNN for image fusion, value of per pixel is used to motivate per neuron. In this paper, image feature of per pixel, e. g. gradient and local energy, is used to motivate per neuron and generate <b>firing</b> <b>maps.</b> Each <b>firing</b> <b>map</b> is corresponding to one type feature. Furthermore, a new multi-channel PCNN is presented to combine these <b>firing</b> <b>maps</b> via a weighting function which measures the contribution of these features to the fused image quality. Finally, pixels with maximum firing times, when firing times of source images are compared, are selected as the pixels of the fused image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms Wavelet-based and Wavelet-PCNN-based fusion algorithms. supported by Navigation Science Foundation of China under grant no. 05 F 07001 and National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant no. 6047208...|$|R

40|$|Severe crown {{fires are}} {{determining}} disturbances for {{the composition and}} structure of boreal forests in North America. Fire cycle (FC) associations with continental climate gradients are well known, but smaller scale controls remain poorly documented. Using a time since <b>fire</b> <b>map</b> (time scale of 300 years), the study aims to assess the relative contributions of local and regional controls on FC and to describe the relationship between FC heterogeneity and vegetation patterns. The study area, located in boreal eastern North America, was partitioned into watersheds according to five scales going from local (3 km 2) to landscape (2800 km 2) scales. Using survival analysis, we observed that dry surficial deposits and hydrography density better predict FC when measured at the local scale, while terrain complexity and slope position perform better when measured at the middle and landscape scales. The most parsimonious model was selected according to the Akaike information criterion to predict FC throughout the study area. We detected two FC zones, one short (159 years) and one long (303 years), with specific age structures and tree compositions.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} current satellite-based <b>fire</b> <b>mapping</b> activities at several institutions in Russia that provide operational fire monitoring at federal and regional levels. The current operational systems are {{based on data from}} the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) on the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration (NOAA) operational polar orbiting environmental satellite series. Detailed descriptions of the data acquisition and preprocessing systems, algorithms, and the suite of fire products are provided. Each institution has expertise in addressing a specific aspect of satellite-based <b>fire</b> <b>mapping</b> and monitoring.

They {{were concerned about}} fragmentation of the landscape by subdivisions and the decline in productivity and biological diversity of the grasslands because of the encroachment of woody species onto grasslands (McDonald 1996). They believed {{that the lack of}} natural fires was {{a major factor in the}} shift in vegetation. The group was galvanized into action in 1992 following the active suppression of a beneficial fire in a grass-creosote brush (Larrea spp.) area where escape was unlikely. The Malpai Borderlands Group was formalized soon afterwards as a non-profit organization with the immediate goals to establish a fire management plan that included ranchers and land management agencies, and to create a <b>fire</b> <b>map</b> that indicated how the private landowners wanted fire starts to be handled. Unfortunately, the map was not always used by the agencies suppressing fires. In 1994, a lightning fire ignited in Sycamore Canyon east of Douglas and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) initiated aggressive suppression. The fire was actually reducing natural fuels, shrubs, and tree cover, and was creating a mosaic of vegetation types. It took a major effort by the landowner and the local Forest Service representative to halt the costly suppression activities.|$|E
40|$|Currently {{available}} satellite {{active fire}} detection {{products from the}} VIIRS and MODIS instruments on polar-orbiting satellites produce detection squares in arbitrary locations. There is no global fire/no <b>fire</b> <b>map,</b> no detection under cloud cover, false negatives are common, and the detection squares are much coarser than the resolution of a fire behavior model. Consequently, current active fire satellite detection products {{should be used to}} improve fire modeling in a statistical sense only, rather than as a direct input. We describe a new data assimilation method for active fire detection, based on a modification of the fire arrival time to simultaneously minimize the difference from the forecast fire arrival time and maximize the likelihood of the fire detection data. This method is inspired by contour detection methods used in computer vision, and it can be cast as a Bayesian inverse problem technique, or a generalized Tikhonov regularization. After the new fire arrival time on the whole simulation domain is found, the model can be re-run from a time in the past using the new fire arrival time to generate the heat fluxes and to spin up the atmospheric model until the satellite overpass time, when the coupled simulation continues from the modified state.

40|$|A {{standard}} method {{for assessing the}} accuracy of fire mapping derived from NOAA-AVHRR imagery was applied to five Landsat scenes sampling different regions across northern Australia. The procedure involved the undertaking of: (1) detailed ground verification exercises (using ground and aerial transects) {{at the time of}} Landsat overpasses; (2) assessment of the accuracy of fire mapping derived from relatively high resolution Landsat imagery, using the ground-truth verification data; and (3) using the Landsat fire mapping as a basis for assessing the accuracy of fire mapping produced from more coarse-resolution NOAA-AVHRR imagery, employing a regression approach. As well, using <b>fire</b> <b>map</b> data interpreted from Landsat imagery (both MSS and TM) and NOAA-AVHRR for two of these scene areas, the size class distribution of fires was determined principally to assess the reliability of mapping small fires with NOAA-AVHRR imagery. Accuracy of fire mapping undertaken at the Landsat scale was consistently greater than 80 % (range 84 - 99 %). For assessing the accuracy of fire mapping derived from NOAA-AVHRR, a regression approach was applied using the mapped extent of burning from both Landsat and NOAA-AVHRR in 10 X 10 km 2 grid cells. Results indicated variable, but generally high mapping accuracy, with r ranging from 0. 41 - 0. 81. Assessment of the size class distribution of fires indicates that mapping from NOAA-AVHRR imagery a priori misses all fires less than 1 pixel (1 km 2) in size; which constitute by far the great majority of individual fires. The assessment indicates that fire mapping accuracy using current semi-manual mapping procedures is generally high, but needs to be substantially automated if mapping quality is to be improved consistently...|$|E

Differences in NDVI and differences in NBR (dNBR) depend on the pre-fire vegetation, which varies by forest type and successional stage (Miller and Thode 2007).

Remote sensing provides a useful technique for investigating coal fields at a large scale and for detecting coal fires. In this study, the spreading direction of a coal fire in the Wuda Coal Field (WCF), northwest China, was analyzed using multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) thermal infrared (TIR) data. Using an automated method and based on the land surface temperatures (LST) that were retrieved from these thermal data, coal fires related to thermal anomalies were identified; the locations of these fires were validated using a coal <b>fire</b> <b>map</b> (CFM) that was developed via field surveys; and the cross-validation of the results was also carried out using the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) thermal infrared images.

The study delineated the spreading direction using the results of the coal fire dynamics analysis, and a coal fire spreading direction map was generated. The results showed that the coal fires primarily spread north or northeast in the central part of the WCF and south or southwest in the southern part of the WCF. In the northern part of the WCF, some coal fires were spreading north, perhaps coinciding with the orientation of the coal belt. Certain coal fires scattered in the northern and southern parts of the WCF were extending in bilateral directions.

Coal fires not only burn valuable non-renewable coal reserves but also severely affect the local and global environment. The Rujigou coalfield in Shizuishan City, Ningxia, NW China, {{is well known for}} being a storehouse of anthracite coal. This coalfield is also known for having more coal fires than most other coalfields in China. In this study, an attempt was made to study the dynamics of coal fires in the Rujigou coalfield, from 2001 to 2007, using multi-temporal nighttime Landsat data. The multi-temporal nighttime short wave infrared (SWIR) data sets based on a fixed thresholding technique were used to detect and monitor the surface coal fires and the nighttime enhanced thematic mapper (ETM+) thermal infrared (TIR) data sets, based on a dynamic thresholding technique, were used to identify the thermal anomalies related to subsurface coal fires. By validating the coal fires identified in the nighttime satellite data and the coal fires extracted from daytime satellite data with the coal <b>fire</b> <b>map</b> (CFM) manufactured by field survey, we found that the results from the daytime satellite data had higher omission and commission errors than the results from the nighttime satellite data.

The average mass concentration of the submicron particles (PM 1) was 5. 7  ±  5. 4  µg m − 3 during the field campaign, ranging from 0. 1 up to 33. 3  µg m − 3. Organic aerosol (OA) was the dominant component in PM 1, with a fraction of 68  %. Three OA factors, i. e., biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA), biomass-burning-influenced oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA-BB) and oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA), were resolved using positive matrix factorization analysis. The two oxygenated OA factors accounted for 87  % of the total OA mass.

The {{proposed}} new fusion algorithm {{is based on}} the improved pulse coupled neural network (PCNN) model, the fundamental characteristics of images and the properties of human vision system. Compared with the traditional algorithm where the linking strength of each neuron is the same and its value is chosen through experimentation, this algorithm uses the contrast of each pixel as its value, so that the linking strength of each pixel can be chosen adaptively. After the processing of PCNN with the adaptive linking strength, new <b>fire</b> <b>mapping</b> images are obtained for each image taking part in the fusion. The clear objects of each original image are decided by the compare-selection operator with the <b>fire</b> <b>mapping</b> images pixel by pixel and then all of them are merged into a new clear image. Furthermore, by this algorithm, other parameters, for example,, the threshold adjusting constant, only have a slight effect on the new fused image. Therefore, it overcomes the difficulty in adjusting parameters in PCNN.
