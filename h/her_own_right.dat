5|$|Nora Chadwick (1950) {{suggested}} that mythical legends of Þorgerðr and Irpa have become confused and intertwined with historical accounts of Haakon’s wife Þóra and her sister, Guðrún; {{and that the}} figure of the shieldmaiden Lagertha in the Gesta may also be an aspect of Þorgerðr.

60|$|But for {{all this}} fine show this king was not really the king. When the old king died he left a daughter, and {{she should have been}} queen if she had had <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rights.</b> But this king, who was her uncle, had stepped in before her, and so the poor princess was pushed aside and was nobody at all but a princess, the king's niece.|$|R
5|$|The earldom of Suffolk, says {{historian}} Michael Hicks, was 'not particularly well-endowed,' {{probably only}} just scraping the £666 qualifying income for that rank. His mother, though, held substantial estates in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>right,</b> from her father, Sir Thomas Chaucer. Furthermore, {{because this was}} Alice's third marriage, she held large dowers from both previous husbands, the second {{of whom had been}} Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury.|$|E
5|$|Gyllenhaal's first films—her {{feature film}} debut {{at the age}} of 15, Waterland (1992); A Dangerous Woman (1993); and Homegrown (1998)—were {{directed}} by her father; the last two also featured her brother; they had supporting roles as children. With their mother, she and Jake appeared in two episodes of Molto Mario, an Italian cooking show on the Food Network. After graduating from college, she played supporting roles in films like Cecil B.

5|$|The third story follows Daenerys Targaryen, {{daughter}} of Aerys, the last Targaryen king.

The three dragons soon become not only a symbol of her bloodline and her legitimate claim to the throne, but also devastating weapons of war.|$|E
50|$|Her {{memory of}} {{tangible}} facts was very tenacious, {{but it had}} no grasp of abstractions, and it was never apparent that she comprehended {{the idea of a}} deity. She was protective of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rights,</b> and never intentionally invaded those of others, and she was never known to deceive. She was kind and gentle enough to be entrusted with the care of the sick, and made an excellent nurse.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the show}} was a bigger hit in prime time, Moore always {{preferred}} the daytime housewife audience. He thought that it gave the lonely housewives something to listen to and watch while they worked. The show provided a break into show business for many performers, including Alan King, Jonathan Winters, Carol Burnett, and Dorothy Loudon. The Garry Moore Show featured regular supporting cast members Durward Kirby, Marion Lorne, Denise Lor, and Ken Carson, {{as well as a}} mixture of song-and-dance routines and comedy skits, and introduced the public to comedian Carol Burnett. After the show ended, Burnett became a star in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>right,</b> hosting The Carol Burnett Show for many years.|$|E
5|$|The current Raglan Castle {{was begun}} by Sir William ap Thomas, the lesser {{son of a}} minor Welsh family who rose {{through the ranks of}} mid-15th century politics, {{profiting}} from the benefits of the local offices he held. William married first Elizabeth, a wealthy heiress, and then Gwladus ap Thomas, another heiress who would prove to be a powerful regional figure in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>right.</b> In 1432 William purchased the manor of Raglan, where he had already been staying as a tenant, for 1,000 marks (£666) and commenced a programme of building work that established the basic shape of the castle as seen today, although most of it— {{with the exception of the}} South Gate and the Great Tower— was later built over.|$|E
5|$|Warwick's sister, and {{therefore}} Edward IV's niece, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, was executed by Henry VIII in 1541. By then, {{the cause was}} more religious and political rather than dynastic. The attainder of her father, Clarence, was a legal bar to any claims to the throne by his children. Additionally her marriage, arranged by Henry VII, to Sir Richard Pole, his half-cousin and trusted supporter, was not auspicious. Nevertheless, it did allow the couple to be closely involved in court affairs. Margaret's fortunes improved under Henry VIII and in February 1512 she was restored to the earldom of Salisbury and all the Warwicks' lands. This made her the first and, apart from Anne Boleyn, {{the only woman in}} 16th-century England to hold a peerage title in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
50|$|Third party {{standing}} {{is a term}} of the law {{of civil}} procedure that describes when one party may file a lawsuit or assert a defense in which the rights of third parties are asserted. In the United States, this is generally prohibited, as a party can only assert his or <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rights</b> and cannot raise the claims of right of a third party who is not before the court. However, there are several exceptions to this doctrine.|$|R
5000|$|Mary Musgrove (c. 1700-1763) was {{of mixed}} Yamacraw and English ancestry. She {{facilitated}} {{in the development}} of Colonial Georgia and became an important intermediary between Muscogee Creek Indians and the English colonists.

5|$|Ambrose Dudley was {{the fourth}} son of Sir John Dudley, later Viscount Lisle, Earl of Warwick and Duke of Northumberland, and his wife Jane Guildford. The Dudleys had 13 {{children}} in all and were known for their Protestant leanings {{as well as for}} their happy family life. Ambrose Dudley and his brothers were trained by, among others, the mathematician John Dee and the rhetorician Thomas Wilson. In August 1549 Dudley went to Norfolk with his father and his younger brother Robert to fight against the rebel peasant army of Robert Kett. Back in London, Dudley was knighted and married Anne Whorwood, daughter of William Whorwood, deceased Attorney-General. In 1552 they had a daughter who died soon. Anne also died in 1552 of the sweating sickness. Dudley soon married for the second time: Elizabeth Lady Tailboys (or Talboys, 15201563), who was a baroness in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>right</b> with large possessions in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|In the Augustan History, Maeonius was emperor briefly {{before he}} was killed by his soldiers, however, no {{inscriptions}} or evidence exist for his reign. At the time of Odaenathus' assassination, Zenobia might have been with her husband; according to chronicler George Syncellus, he was killed near Heraclea Pontica in Bithynia. The transfer of power seems to have been smooth, since Syncellus reports that the time from the assassination to the army handing the crown to Zenobia was one day. Zenobia may have been in Palmyra, but this would have reduced the likelihood of a smooth transition; the soldiers might have chosen one of their officers, so the first scenario of her being with her husband is more likely. The historical records are unanimous that Zenobia did not fight for supremacy and {{there is no evidence of}} delay in the transfer of the throne to Odaenathus and Zenobia's son, the ten-year-old Vaballathus. Although she never claimed to rule in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>right</b> and acted as a regent for her son, Zenobia held the reins of power in the kingdom, and Vaballathus was kept in his mother's shadow, never exercising real power.|$|E
5|$|Makeba's {{daughter}} Bongi, who was {{a singer}} in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>right</b> and had often accompanied her mother on stage, died in childbirth in 1985. Makeba was left responsible for her two grandchildren, and decided {{to move out of}} Guinea. She settled in the Woluwe-Saint-Lambert district of the Belgian capital Brussels. In the following year, Masekela introduced Makeba to Paul Simon, and a few months later she embarked on Simon's very successful Graceland Tour. The tour concluded with two concerts held in Harare, Zimbabwe, which were filmed in 1987 for release as Graceland: The African Concert. After touring the world with Simon, Warner Bros. Records signed Makeba and she released Sangoma ("Healer"), an album of healing chants named in honour of her sangoma mother. Her involvement with Simon caused controversy: Graceland had been recorded in South Africa, breaking the cultural boycott of the country, and thus Makeba's participation in the tour was regarded as contravening the boycott (which Makeba herself endorsed).|$|E
500|$|Lucy Stone's {{refusal to}} take her husband's name, as an {{assertion}} of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rights,</b> was controversial then, and is largely what she is remembered for today. Women who continue to use their birth name after marriage are still occasionally known as [...] "Lucy Stoners" [...] in the United States. In 1921, the Lucy Stone League was founded in New York City by Ruth Hale, described in 1924 by Time as the [...] "'Lucy Stone'-spouse" [...] of Heywood Broun. The League was re-instituted in 1997.|$|R
