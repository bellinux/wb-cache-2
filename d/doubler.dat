5|$|A voltage <b>doubler</b> is an {{electronic}} circuit which charges capacitors from the input voltage and switches these charges {{in such a}} way that, in the ideal case, exactly twice the voltage is produced at the output as at its input.|$|E
25|$|For simple higher-frequency filter circuits, or in voltage {{regulator}} or voltage <b>doubler</b> circuits, low-cost metallized polyester film capacitors provide long-term stability, and can replace more-expensive tantalum capacitors. Because capacitors pass AC signals but block DC, film capacitors with their high insulation resistance and low self-inductance are well-suited as signal coupling capacitors for higher frequencies. For similar reasons, film capacitors {{are widely used}} as decoupling capacitors to suppress noise or transients.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} version are two-sided bags, either joined {{round the}} edges or folded and joined along two sides. Webbing straps may be stitched to <b>doubler</b> patches {{which are then}} glued or welded to the bag on light duty bags, but on large and heavy duty bags there are usually strips of bag material bonded to the bags which form flat retaining tubes for the webbing which is threaded through the tubes and may be withdrawn for maintenance and inspection. heavy duty open bags are generally conical with a domed top or a reversed truncated cone top, and may have several straps from the lifting point at the bottom, through the guide tubes on the sides, to a crown ring of webbing or steel at the top, to spread the load evenly over {{the fabric of the}} bag.|$|E

500|$|The Greinacher voltage <b>doubler</b> is a {{significant}} improvement over the Villard circuit for a small cost in additional components. [...] The ripple is much reduced, nominally zero under open-circuit load conditions, but when current is being drawn depends on {{the resistance of the}} load and the value of the capacitors used. [...] The circuit works by following a Villard cell stage with what is in essence a peak detector or envelope detector stage. [...] The peak detector cell has the effect of removing most of the ripple while preserving the peak voltage at the output. The Greinacher circuit is also commonly known as the half-wave voltage <b>doubler.</b>|$|E
500|$|Voltage {{doublers}} are {{a variety}} of voltage multiplier circuit. [...] Many, but not all, voltage <b>doubler</b> circuits {{can be viewed as a}} single stage of a higher order multiplier: cascading identical stages together achieves a greater voltage multiplication.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} to use the simple diode-capacitor circuits described above to double the voltage of a DC source by preceding the voltage <b>doubler</b> with a chopper circuit. [...] In effect, this converts the DC to AC before application to the voltage <b>doubler.</b> [...] More efficient circuits can be built by driving the switching devices from an external clock so that both functions, the chopping and multiplying, are achieved simultaneously. [...] Such circuits are known as switched capacitor circuits. [...] This approach is especially useful in low-voltage battery-powered applications where integrated circuits require a voltage supply greater than the battery can deliver. [...] Frequently, a clock signal is readily available on board the integrated circuit and little or no additional circuitry is needed to generate it.|$|E

500|$|The Dickson charge pump, or Dickson multiplier, {{consists}} of a cascade of diode/capacitor cells with the bottom plate of each capacitor driven by a clock pulse train. [...] The circuit is a modification of the Cockcroft-Walton multiplier but takes a DC input with the clock trains providing the switching signal instead of the AC input. [...] The Dickson multiplier normally requires that alternate cells are driven from clock pulses of opposite phase. [...] However, since a voltage <b>doubler,</b> shown in figure 7, requires only one stage of multiplication only one clock signal is required.Yuan, pp.13-14 ...|$|E
500|$|The Dickson {{multiplier}} {{is frequently}} employed in integrated circuits where the supply voltage (from a battery for instance) {{is lower than}} that required by the circuitry.

500|$|The Delon circuit uses {{a bridge}} {{topology}} for voltage doubling; consequently {{it is also}} called a full-wave voltage <b>doubler.</b> This form of circuit was, at one time, commonly found in cathode ray tube television sets where {{it was used to}} provide an [...] Extra high tension (EHT) supply. Generating voltages in excess of 5kV with a transformer has safety issues in terms of domestic equipment and in any case is uneconomical. However, black and white television sets required an e.h.t. of 10kV and colour sets even more. Voltage doublers were used to either double the voltage on an e.h.t winding on the mains transformer or were applied to the waveform on the line flyback coils.Millman and Halkias, p.109Wharton and Howorth, pp.68–69 ...|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} and {{improvements to the}} basic Dickson charge pump. [...] Many of these are concerned with reducing {{the effect of the}} transistor drain-source voltage. [...] This can be very significant if the input voltage is small, such as a low-voltage battery. [...] With ideal switching elements the output is an integral multiple of the input (two for a <b>doubler)</b> but with a single-cell battery as the input source and MOSFET switches the output will be far less than this value since much of the voltage will be dropped across the transistors. [...] For a circuit using discrete components the Schottky diode would be a better choice of switching element for its extremely low voltage drop in the on state. [...] However, integrated circuit designers prefer to use the easily available MOSFET and compensate for its inadequacies with increased circuit complexity.Yuan, 14-21 ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{next step}} was when Abraham Bennet, the {{inventor}} of the gold leaf electroscope, described a [...] "doubler of electricity" [...] (Phil. Trans., 1787), as a device similar to the electrophorus, but that could amplify a small charge by means of repeated manual operations with three insulated plates, {{in order to make it}} observable in an electroscope. Erasmus Darwin, W. Wilson, G. C. Bohnenberger, and (later, 1841) J. C. E. Péclet developed various modifications of Bennet's device. Francis Ronalds automated the generation process in 1816 by adapting a pendulum bob as one of the plates, driven by clockwork or a steam engine – he created the device to power his electric telegraph. In 1788, William Nicholson proposed his rotating <b>doubler,</b> which can be considered as the first rotating influence machine. His instrument was described as [...] "an instrument which by turning a winch produces the two states of electricity without friction or communication with the earth". (Phil.

2500|$|Others, {{including}} T. Cavallo (who {{developed the}} [...] "Cavallo multiplier", a charge multiplier using simple addition, in 1795), John Read, Charles Bernard Desormes, and Jean Nicolas Pierre Hachette, developed further {{various forms of}} rotating doublers.

The most interesting of these were described in the [...] "Annalen der Physik" [...] (1801). Giuseppe Belli, in 1831, developed a simple symmetrical <b>doubler</b> which consisted of two curved metal plates between which revolved a pair of plates carried on an insulating stem. It was the first symmetrical influence machine, with identical structures for both terminals. This apparatus was reinvented several times, by C.F.

2500|$|The guitar {{controller}} for Rock Band, {{modeled after}} a Fender Stratocaster, {{is used for}} lead guitar and bass guitar gameplay. It has several features akin to Guitar Heros controller, as it features five colored fret buttons on {{the neck of the}} guitar (which correspond to on-screen notes), a strum bar, and a whammy bar. To use the guitar controller, players must hold the fret button that corresponds to the scrolling colored note on-screen while simultaneously pushing the strum bar. In addition, five smaller fret buttons are located further down on the neck. [...] These buttons can be used to play all notes in guitar solos (denoted by the note track turning blue) as hammer-ons and pull-offs, without the need to strum. The whammy bar can be used to distort the sound of held notes. A special effects switch can be used to toggle between five different guitar effects during solos and Overdrive periods (ranging from wah-wah, flange, chorus, echo, distortion, <b>doubler,</b> slap back echo, medium echo, and long echo), however, this switch was removed from the Rock Band 3 edition of the guitar. Overdrive for guitarists can be deployed by holding the controller in a vertical position or pressing the [...] "Select/Back/-" [...] button. The controller is offered in both wired and wireless versions. Rock Band games allow players to apply a [...] "Lefty Flip" [...] setting, supporting left-handed guitar players. [...] The second version of the controller, distributed with Rock Band 2, introduced quieter fret buttons, a more reliable strum bar, and optical sensor and microphone to help the player calibrate the video and audio output from their television/stereo system's setup.|$|E
