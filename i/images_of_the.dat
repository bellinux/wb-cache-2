We prove that, for a p-group over Fp whose ring of invariants is a polynomial algebra, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transfer is a principal ideal. We compute <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transfer for SLn(Fq) and GLn(Fq) showing that both ideals are principal. We prove that, for a permutation group, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transfer is a radical ideal and for a cyclic permutation group <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transfer is a prime ideal...|$|R

5|$|Just as {{the image}} of the wife in {{advertising}} has reflected the general views of the appropriate roles of a wife, <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> husband also reflect the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> husband as performing work outside of the home and taking care of the family finances. It has been noted that this role has been especially prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one is not likely to find an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in household chores, except when they are depicted as particularly bad at performing the housework. In addition, it has been noted that over time, the portrayal of husbands and wives in an intimate, romantic relationship has been on the rise.|$|E

5|$|A {{comprehensive}} analysis {{conducted in}} 1980 by Hopson questioned Thulborn's ideas.

He did acknowledge that X-ray <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most complete specimen showed that this individual indeed lacked unerupted replacement teeth. According to Hopson, this indicated that only juveniles continuously replaced their teeth, and that this process ceased when reaching adulthood. Thulborn's aestivation hypothesis was rejected by Hopson due to lack of evidence.|$|E
