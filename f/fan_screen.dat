50|$|By {{the time}} the railway {{connection}} was finished in 1923, 26 miners and a similar number of surface men were at work at the Bowen Consolidated Coal Mine and output was averaging 35 tons of coal per day. Twin tramways were laid down the tunnels and serviced by a stationary steam hauling engine, a compressed air water pump was installed {{at the foot of}} the tunnel and the ventilation was improved by sinking a vertical shaft to an extension of one of the cross-cuts and equipping it with a double-inlet sirocco-type <b>fan.</b> <b>Screens</b> were installed on the loading gantry and the Cornish boilers supplied steam to the whole mine. An office building and bath-house were erected and by 1925 the main tunnel in the Garrick seam was 480m long and under 60m of cover. Coal output was 120 tons per day.|$|R

50|$|A film {{adaptation}} of the book was produced by Focus Features, Michael De Luca Productions, and Trigger Street Productions, with Universal Pictures and Focus Features securing {{the rights to the}} trilogy in March 2012. Universal is also the film's distributor. Charlie Hunnam was originally cast in the role of Christian Grey alongside Dakota Johnson in the role of Anastasia Steele, but Hunnam gave up the part in October 2013, with Jamie Dornan announced for the role on 23 October. The film was released on 13 February 2015, and became an immediate success, making it to #1 at the box office with $558.5 million. However, critical reactions were generally negative. After the first film premiered at a special <b>fan</b> <b>screening</b> in New York City on 6 February 2015, director Sam Taylor-Johnson confirmed two sequels to be succeeded after the first film, with Fifty Shades Darker to be released February 10 2017.|$|R

40|$|Variable {{screening}} {{techniques have}} been proposed to mitigate the impact of high dimensionality in clas-sification problems, including t-test marginal <b>screening</b> (<b>Fan</b> & Fan, 2008) and maximum marginal like-lihood <b>screening</b> (<b>Fan</b> & Song, 2010). However, these methods rely on strong modelling assumptions that are easily violated in real applications. To circumvent the parametric modelling assumptions, we propose a new variable screening technique for binary classification based on the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic. We prove that this so-called Kolmogorov filter enjoys the sure screening property under much weakened model assumptions. We supplement our theoretical study by a simulation study. Some key words: Dvoretzky–Kiefer–Wolfowitz inequality; Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; Sure screening property...|$|R

5000|$|In 1996, Adams {{decided to}} start using the {{longtime}} nickname of [...] "Ash" [...] professionally in place of Jason. The switch came about {{as a result of}} increasing confusion among viewers, <b>fans,</b> <b>Screen</b> Actors Guild officials and others in the media between certain credits of his and those of a newer, up-and-coming actor, Jason Leland Adams (to whom he is not related). When the latter Adams entered the SAG for the first time, he immediately had to register his middle name of Leland in from the start since the former Jason Adams already existed in their index. However, {{despite the fact that the}} first Jason Adams had already been a known face in Hollywood for the past decade, announcements of new projects with the newer Jason (Leland) Adams in the cast automatically led people to think it was the first Jason, since not all casting sources adhered to the proper SAG listing of the newer Jason's name. The situation became even more convoluted when other records began erroneously listing the first Jason Adams' middle name as being Leland, when in fact it never was. Finally, the original Jason Adams decided to ease the situation by dropping his real first name altogether, and becoming Ash Adams.|$|R

50|$|The rigid or <b>screen</b> <b>fan</b> (éventail a écran) became also fashionable {{during the}} 18th and 19th century. They never {{reached the same}} level of {{popularity}} as the easy to carry around, folding fans which became almost an integrated part of women's dress. The <b>screen</b> <b>fan</b> was mainly used inside the interior of the house. In 18th and 19th century paintings of interiors one sometimes sees one laying on a chimney mantle. They were mainly used to protect a woman's face against the glare and heat of the fire, to avoid getting 'coup rose' or ruddy cheeks from the heat. But probably not in the least it served to keep the heat from spoiling the carefully applied make-up which in those days was often wax-based. For a better understanding we have to realise that until the mid 20th century houses were heated by open fires in chimneys or by stoves, and the lack of insolation made many a house very draughty and cold during winter. Therefore, any social or family gathering would be in close proximity to the fireplace.|$|R
50|$|The style drew upon Swiss chalet architecture, {{which had}} been {{introduced}} to America by Andrew Jackson Downing around 1850. Log construction was popularized by Downing's protégé, Calvert Vaux, in his pattern book Villas and Cottages in 1857. Downing's design principles emphasized utility, structural expression, and conformity to natural surroundings. The building form was influenced by Stick style, but using log framing instead of dimensional lumber to express the structural system of the buildings. Charles Eastlake's book Hints on Household Taste in Furniture, Upholstery and other Details also influenced the Adirondack rustic style. Interior decorations such as rustic and Mission Style furniture, mounted trophies of fish and game, Japanese <b>fans</b> and <b>screens,</b> and American Indian artifacts were influenced by Eastlake's ideas.|$|R
