5|$|Lavender Foal Syndrome (LFS), {{also called}} Coat Color Dilution Lethal (CCDL). Recessive disorder, fatal when homozygous, {{carriers}} show no signs. The condition has its name because most affected foals {{are born with}} a coat color dilution that lightens {{the tips of the}} coat hairs, or even the entire hair shaft. Foals with LFS are unable to stand at birth, often have seizures, and are usually euthanized within a few days of birth. In November 2009, Cornell University announced that a <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> has been developed to detect carriers of LFS. Simultaneously, the University of Pretoria also announced that they had also developed a <b>DNA</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E

5|$|In December 1983, Graysmith tracks Allen {{down to a}} Vallejo Ace Hardware store, {{where he}} is {{employed}} as a sales clerk. The men have a brief encounter before Graysmith leaves. Eight years later, victim Mike Mageau meets with authorities and identifies Allen from a police mugshot. As the authorities walk by an airport book store, copies of Graysmith's book Zodiac are shown. Final title cards inform the audience that Allen died in 1992 before he could be questioned further. A <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> performed in 2002 on an archived autopsy sample did not match a partial DNA sample gathered from the postage stamp {{on one of the}} Zodiac letters, but this does not rule him out as a suspect.|$|E
5|$|Initially Bueno's mother {{claimed to}} be the {{absolute}} owner of his recorded material as well as profits. Judge Ricardo Sangiorg of the 76th Civil Court froze all of the assets held in bank accounts and copyrighted material hosted by SADAIC and the Argentine Musician's Union, as requested by the legal group Cúneo Libarona-Ballester, the representatives of Patricia Pacheco and her son Ramiro. Pacheco claimed that Ramiro Pacheco was the legitimate son of Bueno and requested a <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> to verify it. The lawyers sent legal notices to Olave, her lawyer Miguel Angel Pierri and Gozalo stating that none of the assets of Bueno's estate could be used or spent until it was decided which one of the parties would inherit them.|$|E

5|$|Keith ends his {{relationship}} with Wallace's mother Alicia Fennel (Erica Gimpel) to give Lianne a second chance. Because Celeste refused to pay the $50,000 reward for finding Duncan, Keith sues the Kanes, who agree to pay if Veronica signs away any future claim to their estate. Once Veronica signs, Keith shows her the <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> that proves he is her father, meaning Veronica never had a claim of the estate. Logan is arrested, and once released he angrily breaks up with Veronica for providing the evidence against him. Logan then explains that when he saw Lilly after returning from Mexico, he knew their relationship was over and wrote a letter which he left in her car.|$|E
5|$|Scully tells Doggett {{that while}} the <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> disproves Fassl's culpability, it implicates a {{possible}} blood relative; Fassl, however, is an only child. Reyes proposes that the murders are being conducted by an entity rather than a person. Meanwhile, Fassl approaches Assistant District Attorney Damon Kaylor and begs to {{be sent back to}} prison. Kaylor refuses, but is killed by the Bearded Man. After hearing of Kaylor's disappearance, Reyes theorizes that Fassl's piety and his unwillingness to acknowledge his darker half has given him the unwanted ability to physically change into another, more violent person.|$|E
5|$|The {{first episode}} then makes a timeskip from 1989 to 2012. Pablo works for Clemente's company, and Andrés is a slacker without a stable job {{who works as}} dog walker. María Laura hires Andrés by chance, and remembers their 1989 encounter; a <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> {{confirms}} that Andrés (not Pablo) {{is the father of}} her son, Martín. These events give the series its basic plot: Andrés tries to adjust to his newly discovered paternity, Pablo resents his intrusion, Martín tries to stay on good terms with both of them and María Laura begins a romance with Andrés. Pablo cheats on her with Patricia Longo (Isabel Macedo), Clemente's wife and secretary. She becomes pregnant by Pablo, but claims that Clemente is her son's father.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} that some of Victoria's descendants did have mild porphyria (although some historians now think {{it could have been}} bi-polar disorder), most notably Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen. This disease may have affected her grandfather, George III and this could give credence to Victoria's legitimate birth. There is more reliable documentation that one of her great-great-grandsons, Prince William of Gloucester, was diagnosed with the disease shortly before his death when his aircraft crashed during an air race. Concrete evidence on the origins of the disease and paternity of Victoria could be achieved with a <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> of her or her parents' remains, but no such study has been sanctioned by the Royal Family.|$|E
5|$|During a {{time when}} they are both {{particularly}} vulnerable, Dimitri and Edmund's wife, Maria, sleep together. When Maria finds out she is pregnant, they have a <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> done. Skye Chandler, who is in love with Edmund, tampers with test so it will show Dimitri is the father when it is in fact Edmund. After Maria confesses everything, a devastated Edmund tells Dimitri that he is dead to him and he will be bringing the child up as his own. Maria gives birth to a baby girl named Maddie and is later presumed dead in a plane crash. Dimitri discovers that Edmund is Maddie's father when he finds out their blood types do not match. He takes her to Vadzel, but Edmund tracks them down and takes back custody of Maddie. The brothers remain estranged for quite some time, but eventually manage to reconcile. Dimitri leaves Pine Valley permanently in 2001 with his current wife, Alex Devane.|$|E
5|$|Kidney {{and heart}} {{diseases}} {{have been reported}} in the breed. In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV in the breed. This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it. There are DNA tests available for GSD IV, and it is highly recommended (some cat associations obligate their Norwegian Forest cat breeder members) to carry out the <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> before using such animals for breeding. PawPeds provide a pedigree database which comes together with health programmes, through publishing each single cat's test result, to provide useful information for breeders to make a well-informed breeding decision. The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia, which is a rare, partially hereditary disease of the hip joint.|$|E

5|$|Kresge {{comes to}} see Scully, {{telling her that}} the Sims {{received}} several large payments from a pharmaceutical company, Prangen Industries. The two visit Dr. Calderon, who tells them that Emily was part of clinical trials and that Roberta was paid the money {{to keep her from}} pulling Emily from the program. Marshall Sim is arrested for the murder of his wife. Scully visits Emily and gives her the cross necklace. Marshall confesses soon after, but is found dead in his cell shortly after being visited by the two dark-suited men. Bill shows Scully a photo of Melissa, who is clearly not pregnant, shortly before Emily was born, which he thinks proves that she isn't Emily's mother. Scully meets with someone from an adoptive agency, wanting to adopt Emily. The woman is very hesitant considering Scully's job and the fact that Emily is a special needs child. Scully flashes back to talking with Melissa around Christmas time shortly before she joined the FBI. On Christmas morning Scully receives the results of a <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> from the FBI proving that Melissa is not Emily's mother—she is.|$|E
5|$|Later, Black is {{informed}} that the girls are missing. She and Means search the woods, finding the girls in a grotto. They are with a teacher from the school, Ben Fisher (John Pyper-Ferguson) who attacks Means; she subdues him and he is arrested. She later confronts him, and it is revealed {{he is a former}} Group member charged with protecting the girls due to their powers. When Black later learns that Fisher has been released, she fears for McKenna's life. She rushes to the school, knowing the girls will be at a prayer meeting. She arrives just too late to prevent Alex from firing upon the meeting; Fisher is killed while shielding McKenna. Later, Means shows Black two sets of <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> results—one from McKenna, the other from the Shroud of Turin. The profiles seem to prove that McKenna is related to Jesus Christ; Means entrusts them, and the decision as to whether to proliferate them, to Black.|$|E
5|$|Later, Scully {{speaks with}} the man. He claims he {{received}} his burns due to alien testing and that he knew Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). He further elaborates that {{he was sent to}} the FBI to retrieve certain files. Scully suspects the man is lying, but asks to examine his burns to investigate his strange claims. He notes that they are the result of an injection that failed to transform him into one of the aliens. The man claims a new conspiracy has formed after the previous one was destroyed; the new one being hidden within the government and the conspirators involved being alien. Doggett theorizes that the man is actually Mulder. Scully takes the man to her house to give him the files he seeks. Suddenly, William begins to cry, only to be quieted when the scarred man picks him up. Meanwhile, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) meets with Doggett and the two discuss the idea that the man is actually Mulder. Skinner points out the inconsistencies in Doggett's reasoning, but a <b>DNA</b> <b>test</b> is undertaken anyway.|$|E
