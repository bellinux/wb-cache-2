500|$|DeConcini later {{charged that}} McCain had {{leaked to the}} press {{sensitive}} information about the investigation that came {{from some of the}} closed proceedings of the Ethics Committee. McCain denied doing so under oath, although several press reports concluded that McCain {{had been one of the}} main leakers during that time. The GAO investigator later said, [...] "There is absolutely no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that McCain made those leaks." [...] Vice chair Rudman stated in his 1996 autobiography that McCain and his staff were responsible for some of the leaks, but later repudiated the assertion.|$|E
500|$|Shackleton's initial {{reply was}} accommodating: [...] "I {{would like to}} fall in with your views as far as {{possible}} without creating a position that would be untenable to myself". However, Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. [...] "I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided [...] "what limits he puts on his own rights". To this Shackleton replied: [...] "There is no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further".|$|E
500|$|Szilard and Zinn {{conducted}} a simple experiment {{on the seventh}} floor of Pupin Hall at Columbia, using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. Initially nothing registered on the oscilloscope, but then Zinn realized that it was not plugged in. On doing so, they discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible. Szilard later described the event: [...] "We turned the switch and saw the flashes. We watched them for a little while and then we switched everything off and went home." [...] He understood the implications and consequences of this discovery, though. [...] "That night, there was very little <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that the world was headed for grief".|$|E

5000|$|After {{the race}} Attraction's trainer Mark Johnston said: [...] "She doesn't {{have the most}} perfect {{physical}} confirmation in the world, but believe me, {{there are a lot}} worse horses than her. She is a champion two-year-old, the best in Europe, and now she is a Classic winner. She didn't just win that, she galloped and stayed {{all the way to the}} line. I am thrilled to see it happen. Everybody put <b>doubts</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind about her stamina, but really I never doubted her".|$|R

500|$|Wayne Kramer, a guitarist for MC5, {{suggested}} that Hendrix {{had been set}} up as part of a wide-scale crackdown on rock musicians: [...] "I don't have any <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that the right-wing government forces were behind all of that... There was an effort, a movement, to stop this threat that rock and roll represented." [...] Hendrix was not the only prominent rock musician who found himself in legal trouble during May 1969. On May 16, the US embassy in London revoked John Lennon's visa in response to his 1968 drug conviction, describing him as [...] "an inadmissible immigrant". That same day, Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady was arrested for possession of marijuana, and on May 28, Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull were arrested at their London home for marijuana possession.|$|E
500|$|Burton, who {{finished}} second, {{was happy with}} his performance, [...] " [...] Todd Berrier has come in and done a great job, the team’s done a great job. We had one hiccough early on pit road {{but the rest of}} them we picked out our spots every single time, and that’s what it takes; it takes a team effort." [...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "Anytime that Jimmie is down is not usually because of performance, it's usually because of an incident like last week. There was no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind they were going to come this week and make a statement. Obviously leading all the laps pretty much and winning the race sends a statement out there that he is the best, that they're not going to be denied this year." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1981 NFL Draft, Taylor {{was drafted}} by the NFL's New York Giants as the 2nd pick overall. In a poll of NFL General Managers (GMs) taken before the draft 26 of the league's 28 GMs said {{if they had the}} first {{selection}} they would select Taylor. One of the two GMs who said they would not take Taylor was Bum Phillips, who had just been hired as coach and general manager by the New Orleans Saints. As fate would have it for Taylor, the Saints were also the team who had the first pick in the draft. Giants GM George Young predicted before the draft that he would be better than NFL legends such as Dick Butkus: [...] "Taylor is the best college linebacker I've ever seen. Sure, I saw Dick Butkus play. There's no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind about Taylor. He's bigger and stronger than Butkus was. On the blitz, he's devastating." ...|$|E
5000|$|For {{about two}} {{thousand}} years a reserve of energy has fed and supported us, and filled our lives, but during the last century a split has opened in this reserve, and its components have begun to disintegrate: God, perspective, colour, the Bible, shape, line, traditions, the so-called humanities, love, devotion, family, school, education, the prophets and Christ himself. Have I too, perhaps, <b>doubted</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> time?

500|$|Contemporaries of Edwards {{have been}} unstinting in their praise of his abilities. Bobby Charlton {{described}} him as [...] "the only player {{that made me feel}} inferior" [...] and said his death was [...] "the biggest single tragedy ever to happen to Manchester United and English football". Terry Venables claimed that, had he lived, it would have been Edwards, not Bobby Moore, who lifted the World Cup trophy as England captain in 1966. Tommy Docherty stated that [...] "there is no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that Duncan would have become the greatest player ever. Not just in British football, with United and England, but the best in the world. George Best was something special, as was Pelé and Maradona, but in my mind Duncan was much better in terms of all-round ability and skill." [...] In recognition of his talents Edwards was made an inaugural inductee to the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002. [...] His memorabilia was exhibited at Dudley Museum prior to its closure, and was subsequently sold to Manchester United with a selection to be loaned back for display at the Dudley Archives.|$|E
500|$|In {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision. [...] "It {{was the wrong}} decision, and I think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that. There's no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind I would have made those saves. And {{the fact of the}} matter is it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, and I think you have to live in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E
500|$|Four {{days after}} Kesler's return, Jannik Hansen was {{involved}} in a controversial hit on the Chicago Blackhawks' Marian Hossa. As both players went up for an airborne puck, Hansen struck Hossa {{in the back of the}} head with his forearm and elbow. Hossa then laid on the ice for a few minutes, during which time the training staff examined him before he was able to leave under his own power. Hansen was given a two-minute minor for roughing and Hossa did not return to the game. Opinions of the hit varied with former NHL referee Kerry Fraser, stating that he did not believe that there was any deliberate or malicious intent, and that he would be surprised if Hansen received a suspension for the play. Meanwhile, former Blackhawks analyst Ed Olczyk stated, [...] "there’s no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind, once he didn’t play the puck, he had one thing in his mind, and that was to put his forearm or elbow in the back of the head of Marian Hossa," [...] and he would be surprised if Hansen was not suspended. Hossa returned to practice the following day. Hansen was suspended for one game due to what Brendan Shanahan called [...] "the carelessness and force of which the blow was delivered." ...|$|E

500|$|IGN's Craig Harris {{said that}} the titles were [...] "like a gap filler to make the wait for a new Pokémon game {{just a little more}} bearable". Jim Sterling of Destructoid stated, [...] "While it is, at its core, the same game that you've played many years ago, it still manages to feel new and the updated {{features}} bolster the original experience in a manner that never intrudes and only enhances". 1UP.com's Justin Haywald stated that [...] "HeartGold/SoulSilver is easily the best Pokémon game yet". VideoGamer.com reviewer Jamin Smith said, [...] "With HeartGold and SoulSilver the Pokémon series has reached a point where it can't get any better." [...] Eurogamer's Keza MacDonald gave the games a 9/10, stating [...] "They combine everything that was best about the older Pokémon games", citing the Pokémon designs and improved graphics and battle system. GamePros McKinley Noble stated that [...] "it's clear that this is a perfect experience for both old-school trainers and the newest generation of Pokémon fans." [...] GameZone's Cliff Bakehorn III said, [...] "There is not a <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind: Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver are the pinnacle of the entire series." [...] Nathan Meunier of GameSpot gave the games one of the lower scores, criticizing them for a lack of innovation. GamesRadar attributed the game's success to being a remake of classic games.|$|E

Drummer Jason Bittner recently stated about the band's new material, [...] "The songs {{are a little more}} on the darker, angry side... lots of heaviness, lots of crazy guitar, and LOTS of room for me to have some fun. There is no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that this will be the best performance of my career, so far, and I owe that to my guys for bringing me incredible riffs to write killer drum parts to." [...] As of the fall of 2009 the band was appearing on the 'Shock & Raw' tour of North America with 2Cents, Otep & Five Finger Death Punch. After a South American tour, Shadows Fall will be playing on the Jägermeister Stage in the 2010 Rockstar Mayhem Festival in July and August 2010. The band is also scheduled to support Lamb of God on their Australian tour in December 2009 Shadows Fall is pleased to announce their first and only New York City performance this year, taking place at Santos Party House on December 18, 2010 with direct support from Thy Will Be Done.|$|E

60|$|Our {{friends at}} home may well rejoice with us, for {{we are at}} our goal, and up to a point, at least, we {{have shown that the}} {{statement}} of Professor Challenger can be verified. We have not, it is true, ascended the plateau, but it lies before us, and even Professor Summerlee is in a more chastened mood. Not that he will for an instant admit that his rival could be right, but he is less persistent in his incessant objections, and has sunk for the most part into an observant silence. I must hark back, however, and continue my narrative from where I dropped it.

60|$|And how nobly {{it raises}} our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm {{tropical}} sea; his vast, mild head overhung by {{a canopy of}} vapor, engendered by his incommunicable contemplations, and that vapor-- as you will sometimes see it--glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts. For d'ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate vapor. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim <b>doubts</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this combination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye.|$|R
60|$|And {{one night}} as I came {{near the village}} of Rosses on the road from Sligo, a fire blazed up on a green bank at my right side seven or eight feet above me, and another fire {{suddenly}} answered from Knock-na-rea. I hurried on doubting, and yet hardly <b>doubting</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart that I saw again the fires that I had seen by the river at Ballisodare. I began occasionally telling people that one should believe whatever had been believed in all countries and periods, and only reject any part of it after much evidence, instead of starting all over afresh and only believing what one could prove. But I was always ready to deny or turn into a joke what was for all that my secret fanaticism. When I had read Darwin and Huxley and believed as they did, I had wanted, because an established authority was upon my side, to argue with everybody.|$|R
