5|$|Michelle {{undergoes}} a session of regression hypnosis, where she {{claims to be}} twenty-four years old. She suddenly starts screaming in panic about someone trying to kill her, and the session is ended. Mulder reviews the video of the session, and <b>is</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> girl is the reincarnation of Morris, having been conceived right around the time the detective was murdered. The tape contains a brief section of static noise just before Michelle begins screaming, which Mulder has an expert clean up. The noise is found to contain a grainy image of {{what appears to be}} a fish tank ornament of a man in an atmospheric diving suit. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Morris' autopsy findings, which show the presence of salt water in his respiratory tract, indicating he died of drowning. The agents realise from these findings that Morris was drowned in the exotic fish tank in Fiore's house.|$|E
5|$|Pinfold is very {{protective}} of his privacy, but uncharacteristically agrees {{to be interviewed}} on BBC radio. The main inquisitor is a man named Angel, whose voice and manner disconcert Pinfold, who believes he detects a veiled malicious intent. In the weeks that follow, Pinfold broods on the incident. He finds his memory beginning to play tricks on him. The encroaching winter depresses him further; he decides to escape by taking a cruise, and secures passage on the SS Caliban, bound for Ceylon. As the voyage proceeds, Pinfold finds that he hears sounds and conversations {{from other parts of}} the ship which he believes are somehow being transmitted into his cabin. Amid an increasingly bizarre series of overheard incidents, he hears remarks which become progressively more insulting, and then directly threatening towards himself. The main tormentors are a man and a woman, whose vicious words are balanced by those of an affectionate younger woman, Margaret. He <b>is</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> man is the BBC interviewer Angel, using his technical knowledge to broadcast the voices. Pinfold spends sleepless nights, awaiting a threatened beating, a kidnapping attempt and a seductive visit from Margaret.|$|E
5|$|The Pevensies save Trumpkin {{from being}} drowned by two Telmarines. Trumpkin <b>is</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> four {{children}} are the Kings and Queens of Old, and they continue on together. Nikabrik and Trufflehunter lead Caspian to a gathering of Narnians, where Caspian convinces them to help him win his throne so he can return their land. They meet the Pevensies and Trumpkin, and all journey to Aslan's How. Peter decides they will attack Miraz's castle, rejecting Lucy's advice that they wait for Aslan to return. The Narnians raid Miraz's castle, but Caspian ruins the plan by freeing Cornelius instead of opening the gate. He learns that Miraz killed his father, and confronts Miraz but is wounded. Overwhelmed, Peter calls for a retreat. Peter, Susan, Edmund, Caspian and the Narnians escape with heavy losses. Upon returning to Aslan's How, Peter and Caspian argue, while back at the castle, Miraz is crowned King.|$|E

2500|$|Mackensen had <b>been</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Allies' main thrust {{would be}} up the Via Anziate, and the ferocity of the British feint on May 23 and 24 did nothing to persuade him otherwise. Kesselring, however, <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Allies' {{intentions}} <b>were</b> to gain Route6 and ordered the Hermann Göring Panzer Division, resting [...] away at Livorno, to Valmontone to hold open Route6 for the Tenth Army, which was retreating up this road from Cassino.|$|R
50|$|Hendrik (Henk) Lindemans {{witnessed}} the exhumation of his brother's body, states <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> remains <b>were</b> {{those of his}} brother.|$|R
25|$|Nick Higham <b>is</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{success of}} the Anglo-Saxon elite in gaining an early {{compromise}} shortly after the Battle of Badon {{is a key to}} the {{success of the}} culture. This produced a political ascendancy across the south and east of Britain, which in turn required some structure to be successful.|$|E
25|$|While {{the courts}} are obligated in theory to give {{deference}} to the NLRB's interpretation of the Act, they do not always do so. The court may direct the NLRB to reconsider its decision or reverse it outright if it <b>is</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Board is in error. The court may also reverse Board actions that it considers to be an abuse of the NLRB's discretion, typically {{in the choice of}} remedies to be applied.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} wife of Huni {{was instead}} a queen Djefatnebty, whose name appears in black ink inscriptions on beer vases from Elephantine. Her name {{is guided by}} the title great one of the hetes-sceptre, making her definitely a queen consort. According to an interpretation by Günter Dreyer, Djefatnebty's death is mentioned alongside several events {{during the reign of}} king Huni, although no king is mentioned in the inscription by his name. Dreyer <b>is</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> notations concern the 22nd year of Huni's reign, since the Turin canon credits him with a reign of 24 years and no 3rd dynasty king is archaeologically proven to have ruled so long. Dreyer's interpretation is not commonly accepted, though.|$|E

25|$|There {{was a rough}} {{dispute between}} President Băsescu and Premier Ponta on fuel price rise by 7 cents, measure adopted since 1 April 2014. The head of state asked Victor Ponta to waive the fee he deems an {{unnecessary}} and discriminatory tax burden. Likewise, Traian Băsescu <b>is</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> measure will lead to tax evasion. The measure was also criticized by opposition. Thus, on 15 March, between 8,000 and 10,000 people, members or supporters of the People's Movement Party, protested in Bucharest's George Enescu Square against Ponta's poor economic policies and wave of taxes that will be introduced once with 1 April. Romania figures among the countries with the most expensive gasoline in the world, at $7.38 per gallon (€1.41 per litre).|$|E
25|$|Mrs. Burke {{presents}} her compliments to Mr. Fox, {{and thanks}} {{him for his}} obliging inquiries. Mrs. Burke communicated his letter to Mr. Burke, and by his desire has to inform Mr. Fox that it has cost Mr. Burke the most heart-felt pain to obey the stern voice of his duty in rending asunder a long friendship, but that he deemed this sacrifice necessary; that his principles continue the same; and that in whatever of life may yet remain to him, he conceives that he must live for others and not for himself. Mr. Burke <b>is</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> principles which he has endeavoured to maintain are necessary to the welfare and dignity of his country, and that these principles can be enforced only by the general persuasion of his sincerity.|$|E
25|$|Myshkin {{follows the}} Yepanchins {{back to their}} dacha, where {{eventually}} Aglaya finds him alone on the verandah. To his surprise, she begins {{to talk to him}} very earnestly about duels and how to load a pistol. They are interrupted by General Yepanchin who wants Myshkin to walk with him. Aglaya slips a note into Myshkin's hand as they leave. The General is greatly agitated by the effect Nastassya Filippovna's behavior is having on his family, particularly since her information about Yevgeny Pavlovich's uncle {{has turned out to be}} completely correct. When the General leaves, Myshkin reads Aglaya's note, which is an urgent request to meet her secretly the following morning. His reflections are interrupted by Keller who has come to offer to be his second at the duel that will inevitably follow from the incident that morning, but Myshkin merely laughs heartily and invites Keller to visit him to drink champagne. Keller departs and Rogozhin appears. He informs the Prince that Nastassya Filippovna wants to see him and that she has been in correspondence with Aglaya. She <b>is</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Prince is in love with Aglaya and is desperately seeking to bring them together. Myshkin is perturbed by the information, but he remains in an inexplicably happy frame of mind and speaks with forgiveness and brotherly affection to Rogozhin. Remembering it will be his birthday tomorrow, he persuades Rogozhin to join him for some wine.|$|E

40|$|Paul Einzig, a London ?nancial journalist, after a four week {{visit to}} New York, observed: With few {{exceptions}} they [?nanciers] <b>were</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> period of prosperity then being experienced was everlasting,. Although just {{then there was}} a minor slump in Wall Streeteverybody I met <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> boom would <b>be</b> resumed (London Financial News 4 / 9 / 26, cited in Davis, 1975 : 132) This would have been an accurate portrayal of the spring of 2000. But this observation was made in spring 1926...|$|R
500|$|Faced {{with the}} monster Tate is, {{and her own}} romantic {{feelings}} for him, Violet accidentally kills herself, something she doesn't realize was successful until weeks later when she discovers she cannot leave the house. After many ghosts, Vivien is committed to an insane asylum, while Ben <b>is</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> second twin was fathered by [...] (Morris Chestnut), a neighbourhood security officer. Meanwhile, Constance enlists {{the help of a}} medium, [...] (Sarah Paulson), to help her talk to Addie. Constance discovers from Billie Dean to her horror, that Tate's child with Vivien will become the Antichrist. After Ben learns of Tate being the [...] "Rubber Man", he has Vivien freed from the asylum.|$|E
500|$|Another {{variety is}} the 1938-D/S, caused by dies bearing an [...] "S" [...] mintmark being repunched with a [...] "D" [...] {{and used to}} strike coins at Denver. While the actual course of events is uncertain, Bowers <b>is</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> variety was created because Buffalo nickel dies {{intended}} for the San Francisco mint were repunched with the [...] "D" [...] and sent to Denver so {{they would not be}} wasted—no San Francisco Buffalo nickels were struck in 1938, but they were produced at Denver, and it was already known that a new design would be introduced. The 1938-D/S was the first repunched mintmark of any US coin to be discovered, causing great excitement among numismatists when the variety came to light in 1962.|$|E
500|$|Using {{a facial}} {{recognition}} system, the ferry bomber is identified and taken into custody. He {{turns out to}} be Carroll Oerstadt (Jim Caviezel), who is angry at the military after being turned down for joining by both the Marines and Army, because their medical screening showed he was unstable. Considering the case now closed, the government shuts down the [...] "Snow White" [...] investigation. Despite the killer having been caught, Claire and the ferry victims remain dead, which unsettles Doug since he <b>is</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Snow White" [...] team can actually alter history. Doug persuades Denny to do one last experiment: send Doug to the past to save Claire and stop the bombing; a risky procedure, since no human has ever been sent back. Doug survives the trip, because he was sent back to a hospital emergency room, where they were able to revive him. He steals an ambulance and races to Oerstadt's shack just in time to stop Claire's murder, while Oerstadt flees with the bomb.|$|E

2500|$|Nigel Collett - {{author of}} biographical book The Butcher of Amritsar - <b>is</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that,</b> <b>the</b> Amritsar {{massacre}} preyed on Dyer’s mind {{from the very}} day he opened fire. “He {{spent the rest of}} his life trying to justify himself. He persuaded himself it had been his duty to act as he did, but he could not persuade his soul that he had done right. It rotted his mind and, I am guessing here, added to his sickness.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2009, Käßmann {{expressed}} {{the opinion that}} it might be better to tear down former and unused churches than to allow them to be used for purposes that could damage their image. As examples of such purposes, she mentioned conversion into restaurants, discothèques, or mosques. A reassignment to a synagogue, however, she found positive. After protests from Muslims, she slightly qualified her statement, saying: [...] "If a Christian congregation <b>is</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> use as a mosque can happen in deepest peace, I concur, but at the moment I do not see that possibility." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1985, Morris became {{interested}} in Dr. James Grigson, a psychiatrist in Dallas. Under Texas law, the death penalty can only be issued if the jury <b>is</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> defendant is not only guilty, but will commit further violent crimes {{in the future if}} he is not put to death. Grigson had spent 15 years testifying for such cases, and he almost invariably gave the same damning testimony, often saying that it is [...] "one hundred per cent certain" [...] that the defendant would kill again. This led to Grigson being nicknamed [...] "Dr. Death". Through Grigson, Morris would meet the subject of his next film, 36-year-old Randall Dale Adams.|$|E
2500|$|Haim Saban {{discussed}} {{his views on}} the Middle East and Persian Gulf region in great detail in a 2006 interview with Haaretz. Particularly notable were his comments regarding Iran: [...] "When I see Ahmadinejad, I see Hitler. They speak the same language. His motivation is also clear: {{the return of the}} Mahdi is a supreme goal. And for a religious person of deep self-persuasion, that supreme goal is worth the liquidation of five and a half million Jews. We cannot allow ourselves that. Nuclear weapons {{in the hands of a}} religious leadership that <b>is</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> annihilation of Israel will bring about the emergence of a new Muslim caliphate? Israel cannot allow that. This is no game. It's truly an existential danger." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2006, the Cultural Association Ladinamo (based in Madrid, and {{represented}} by Javier de la Cueva) was granted {{the use of}} copyleft music in their public activities. The sentence said: [...] "Admitting the existence of music equipment, a joint evaluation of the evidence practiced, this court <b>is</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> defendant prevents communication of works whose management is entrusted to the plaintiff , using a repertoire of authors who have not assigned the exploitation of their rights to the SGAE, having at its disposal a database for that purpose {{and so it is}} manifested both by the legal representative of the Association and by Manuela Villa Acosta, in charge of the cultural programming of the association, which is compatible with the alternative character of the Association and its integration in the movement called 'copy left'".|$|E
