Beams of the size of 20 × 20 × 150 20 × 20 × 150 mm were cast and loaded under four-point bending to obtain the mechanical characteristics of each porosity level. The elastic modulus and flexural strength are found to decrease with increased porosity. Fractography studies have been undertaken to identify the role of the pores on the fracture path.

Individual bullet traps of this nature would typically be backed by a concrete wall to protect from negligent discharges or mechanical failures causing a bullet to miss the target entirely but which is not expected to be struck during the course of normal firing. Intact vehicle tyres are generally only suitable for higher energy projectiles which will easily penetrate their surface. Handgun bullets and shotgun pellets may ricochet back. Granulated rubber (often from shredded tires) is a convenient capture material from which bullets may be separated by gravity during agitation by subsequent bullet impact.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} much need for {{environmentally}} friendly and economical housing in war torn and natural disaster areas of the world. People are left homeless and {{the government needs to}} tackle the cost of resettling those displaced by these unforeseen circumstances. Providing adequate housing in these situations will not only protect people from the physical environment but can also contribute towards better health and reduce the incidence of disease. Given the scale and nature of the issue, many alternative housing systems need to be considered to ensure appropriate choices are being made for a particular situation. In this', project, suitability of a lightweight concrete material has been assessed. The material considered is <b>Expanded</b> Polystyrene <b>Beads</b> (EPS) used as an aggregate replacement in concrete production. An extensive experimental work design aspects based on BS 8110 : Part 1 was considered. The use of polystyrene beads as an alternative aggregate is seen as a viable alternative to conventional concrete aggregates especially in naturally disaster prone and war torn countries of the world, due to its potential performance and variety of applications. At the start, the project examined key properties of polystyrene bead uses and then used the findings to develop a design procedure, followed by comments on its application in the future housing needs meeting sustainability requirements. A wide range of raw materials were used in the premix experiments and each product has its own particular requirements. However, these rules were considered in mixture design. 1. The water content was kept low 2. Using an adequate fibre content about 3...|$|R
