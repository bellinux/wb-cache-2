6000|$|SCENE II.--AMANDA's Dressing-room. Enter AMANDA {{followed}} by her MAID. Maid. If you please, madam, only {{to say whether}} you'll have me buy them or not? Aman. Yes--no--Go, teaser; I care not what you do. Pr'ythee, leave me. [Exit MAID.] Enter BERINTHIA. Ber. What, {{in the name of}} Jove, is the matter with you? Aman. The matter, Berinthia! I'm almost mad; I'm plagued to death. Ber. Who is it that plagues you? Aman. Who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>should</b> plague a wife but her husband? Ber. O, ho! is it come to that?--We shall have you wish yourself a widow, by-and-by. Aman. Would I were anything but what I am! A base, ungrateful man, to use me thus! Ber. What, has he given you fresh reason to suspect his wandering? Aman. Every hour gives me reason. Ber. And yet, Amanda, you perhaps at this moment cause in another's breast the same tormenting doubts and jealousies which you feel so sensibly yourself. Aman. Heaven knows I would not. Ber. Why, you can't tell but there may be some one as tenderly attached to Townly, whom you boast of as your conquest, as you can be to your husband? Aman. I'm sure, I never encouraged his pretensions. Ber. Psha! psha! no sensible man ever perseveres to love without encouragement. Why have you not treated him as you have Lord Foppington? Aman. Because he presumed not so far. But let us drop the subject. Men, not women, are riddles. Mr. Loveless now follows some flirt for variety, whom I'm sure he does not like so well as he does me. Ber. That's more than you know, madam. Aman. Why, do you know the ugly thing? Ber. I think I can guess at the person; but she's no such ugly thing neither. Aman. Is she very handsome? Ber. Truly I think so. Aman. Whate'er she be, I'm sure he does not like her well enough to bestow anything more than a little outward gallantry upon her. Ber. [Aside.] Outward gallantry! I can't bear this.-- [Aloud.] Come, come, don't you be too secure, Amanda: while you suffer Townly to imagine that you do not detest him for his designs on you, you have no right to complain that your husband is engaged elsewhere. But here comes the person we were speaking of. Enter COLONEL TOWNLY. Col. Town. Ladies, as I come uninvited, I beg, if I intrude, you will use the same freedom in turning me out again. Aman. I believe it is near the time Loveless said he would be at home. He talked of accepting Lord Foppington's invitation to sup at Sir Tunbelly Clumsy's. Col. Town. His lordship has done me the honour to invite me also. If you'll let me escort you, I'll let you into a mystery as we go, in which you must play a part when we arrive. Aman. But we have two hours yet to spare; the carriages are not ordered till eight, and it is not a five minutes' drive. So, cousin, let us keep the colonel to play at piquet with us, till Mr. Loveless comes home. Ber. As you please, madam; but you know I have a letter to write. Col. Town. Madam, you know you may command me, though I am a very wretched gamester. Aman. Oh, you play well enough to lose your money, and that's all the ladies require; and so, without any more ceremony, let us go into the next room, and call for cards and candles. [Exeunt.] ...|$|E
60|$|About {{two o'clock}} in the day, Mr Alf did make a speech,--and a very good speech it was, if {{correctly}} reported in the 'Evening Pulpit.' Mr Alf was a clever man, ready at all points, with all his powers immediately at command, and, no doubt, he did make a good speech. But in this speech, in which we may presume that it would be his intention to convince the electors that they ought to return him to Parliament, because, of the two candidates, he was the fittest to represent their views, he did not say a word as to his own political ideas, not, indeed, a word that could be accepted as manifesting his own fitness for the place which it was his ambition to fill. He contented himself with endeavouring to show that the other man was not fit;--and that he and his friends, though solicitous of proving to the electors that Mr Melmotte was about the most unfit man in the world, had been guilty of nothing shabby in their manner of doing so. 'Mr Melmotte,' he said, 'comes before you as a Conservative, and has told us, by the mouths of his friends,--for he has not favoured us with many words of his own,-- that he is supported by the whole Conservative party. That party is not my party, but I respect it. Where, however, are these Conservative supporters? We have heard, till we are sick of it, of the banquet which Mr Melmotte gave yesterday. I am told that very few of those whom he calls his Conservative friends could be induced to attend that banquet. It is equally notorious that the leading merchants of the City refused to grace the table of this great commercial prince. I say that the leaders of the Conservative party have at last found their candidate out, have repudiated him;--and are seeking now to free themselves from the individual shame of having supported the candidature of such a man by remaining in their own houses instead of clustering round the polling booths. Go to Mr Melmotte's committee-room and inquire if those leading Conservatives be there. Look about, and see whether they are walking with him in the streets, or standing with him in public places, or taking the air with him in the parks. I respect the leaders of the Conservative party; but they have made a mistake in this matter, and they know it.' Then he ended by alluding to the rumours of yesterday. 'I scorn,' said he, 'to say anything against the personal character of a political opponent, which I am {{not in a position to}} prove. I make no allusion, and have made no allusion, to reports which were circulated yesterday about him, and which I believe were originated in the City. They may be false or they may be true. As I know nothing of the matter, I prefer to regard them as false, and I recommend you to do the same. But I declared to you long before these reports were in men's mouths, that Mr Melmotte was not entitled by his character to represent you in parliament, and I repeat that assertion. A great British merchant, indeed! How long, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>should</b> a man be known in this city before that title be accorded to him? Who knew aught of this man two years since,--unless, indeed, it be some one who had burnt his wings in trafficking with him in some continental city? Ask the character of this great British merchant in Hamburg and Vienna; ask it in Paris;--ask those whose business here has connected them with the assurance companies of foreign countries, and you will be told whether this is a fit man to represent Westminster in the British parliament!' There was much more yet; but such was the tone of the speech which Mr Alf made with the object of inducing the electors to vote for himself.|$|E

40|$|The ongoing {{consultation}} process on the European Union Global Strategy (EUGS) presents {{an occasion for}} the European Union (EU) to redress the European Security Strategy’s (ESS) shortcomings and update its stance on multilateralism. As rule-based multilateralism remains deeply entrenched in the Union’s DNA, the EUGS is unlikely to represent ground-breaking innovations {{as to how the}} EU should act in international affairs. The key challenge in respect of the EU’s multilateralism is twofold.

40|$|M. Cur. In 1995, the South African Department of Health {{described}} tuberculosis (TB) as South Africa's {{number one}} health problem. The Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) strategy was thereafter implemented {{as a way}} of managing TB patients. One of its key elements is a network of trained treatment supporters who are able to support and observe TB patients swallow their treatment. In Alexandra Township a group of treatment supporters was trained in 1998 and another in 2002 but have subsequently I left the community based DOTS programme., [...] ~ Why do treatment supporters leave the community based DOTS programme? What can be done to make treatment supporters stay on the community based DOTS programme?

Community nurses, treatment supporters and members of the Anti-TB Association were selected for the study. Focus group interviews were conducted with all three sample groups.

40|$|This ethnographic {{dissertation}} examines contemporary {{perceptions of}} higher education {{within the context of}} a Tribal government. The purpose of this dissertation is to understand how Tribal community members perceive higher education as related to Tribal self-determination. This project was partially modeled around two specific research questions relating to Brayboy’s (2012) model of self-determination. Specific research questions for this dissertation included: (1) What are the perceptions of education in a Tribal community as they relate to sovereignty, nation building, and self-determination? (2) Are there differences among perceptions of education between groups (e. g., traditionalists v. credentialists) ? In addition to addressing the specific research questions, this project also included a modified grounded theory to foster emergent theme development. Emergent theme development was intended to account for narratives beyond specific research questions. Participants were presented the following questions in one-on-one, open-ended interviews organized around the following questions: (1) How is formal education important for Tribal members? (2) How is formal education important to Tribal community development? (3) What formal educational credentials are most important to the operations of the Tribe? (4) What do you think formal educational credentials represent? (5) What tensions exist between a formal education v. cultural knowledge? (6) What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>should</b> be the ideal process of Tribal higher education? (7) How well do you think the current educational policies and practices of the Tribe complement self-determination? (8) What are the goals of a self-determination education? Results for this project were mixed. Narratives indicated a relative absence of conceptual constructs associated with Brayboy’s model of self-determination. Additionally, narratives also did not indicate a robust example of group dynamic. Results appeared to indicate an underlying presence of epistemological standpoints to frame Tribal higher education in terms of: (1) Formal Credentials; (2) Practical Experience; and (3) Cultural Experience. Finally, emergent theme development established how educational credentials are promoted, valued, and employed within the Tribal government setting. Narratives produced an extremely nuanced and dynamic landscape of perceptions, groups, utilities, tensions, obstacles, and reforms within Tribes. Narratives also indicated the presence of educational credentialism affecting self-determination in Tribal communities...|$|E

40|$|Narration as a {{fundamental}} activity practiced among human beings dates from long before writing was invented, and spread throughout many different civilisations. Within cultural and literary studies it underwent a renaissance through {{the work of the}} Russian folklorist and scholar Vladimir Propp, who analysed the basic plot components of Russian folk tales (published in Russia in 1928, translated to English in 1958, Morphology of the Folktale). Then, with the breakthrough of text linguistics, the narrative perspective entered forcefully into analyses of non-fictional texts (Wehrlich 1976, van Dijk 1980, Adam 1992). There have been many discussions about the number of components in the narrative structure, but there is currently a more or less clear consensus on the 5 component schema: initial situation, complication, reaction, resolution, final situation. The narrative structure has also entered non-linguistic fields, such as psychology and political science, and more particularly into climate change discourse, where even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has described its reports as “narratives”. With this as a backdrop, we will in the present contribution discuss the notion of narrative and its relevance in the analysis of climate change discourse within different genres, to show that despite their differences in both content and structure, there is a common climate change narrativity. The comparison involves two very distinct genres, the first of which is the political speech, exemplified by French President François Hollande’s prepared remarks at the climate change conference (COP 21) in Paris in late 2015. The second genre has not yet received a label, but can be called “survey discourse”. This corresponds to answers to open-ended questions in a survey undertaken by the Norwegian Citizen Panel in 2015, where respondents answer freely in their own words the following question: “Concerning climate change, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>should</b> be done?” The differences between the two genres are manifold. A political speech is carefully drafted by professionals and represents an institutional commitment by a leader. Survey answers are formulated by anonymous respondents who most often are not specialists in the field, and who in no way are bound by their statements. Despite these differences, our findings will show how these texts belonging to very different genres comprise a plot, and how different characters (heroes, victims, and villains) are integrated into the unfolding ‘story’, thus reflecting the socially pervasive nature of narratives...|$|E
40|$|One tree, many uses Cue: The {{most obvious}} {{advantage}} of indigenous fruit trees is their delicious fruit. There is the sweet juicy mango, or the tasty fig. But when talking to France Gondwe of ICRAF in Malawi, Excello Zidana {{discovered that the}} list of uses for indigenous fruit trees goes on, and on and on. He mentions {{some of the many}} things that fruit trees can provide, but he also talks about the vulnerable status of many of the fruit trees indigenous to Africa. With the introduction of more and more exotic fruit trees, they may not be so common place in the future. So why try to preserve them? IN:	?Apart from fruits which can be eaten?? OUT:	?about the use of indigenous trees. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 23 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was France Gondwe of ICRAF in Malawi encouraging us to plant and cultivate our indigenous fruit trees by spreading the word about their uses. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Gondwe	Apart from fruits which can be eaten for a snack or even for a meal, indigenous trees can also be used as shade trees. They can be planted along homesteads for shade trees, and also for ornamental. We have small hardwood indigenous trees from light construction, like in sheds of tobacco. They can also be used for long term construction, like palm tress, they are used for bridges. There are fig trees which can be used for canoe digging. There are a lot of purposes ? conservation of water shed, for fodder for livestock, fruit processing. There are a lot of purposes, or a lot of benefits. Zidana	And do you believe that these fruit trees have any economic importance that one can actually buy a car? Gondwe	Yes. A car? In the African context we talk of a cow, or cattle! Because indigenous fruit trees can be processed into fruit juices for example. Somebody can {{make a lot of money}} within a short time from processing our indigenous fruit trees like baobab, like tamarindus. So it is very easy to make a lot of income from indigenous fruit trees. Zidana	Can farmers improve the soil fertility in their gardens by planting indigenous fruit trees? Gondwe	Yes they can do that. There are some fruit trees which have a bearing on the improvement of the soil. It can help in soil conservation, so that will automatically improve the soil. The leaves which are falling can be used for, especially these fruit trees which have high nitrogen content in their leaves. Zidana	Let?s talk of a palm tree, what can a farmer get from the palm tree? Gondwe	I can only talk of the common palm tree which is at my home for example, which gives a lot of pulp which we as children used to take the nut, you can eat the nut, but the leaves of the palm tree are also used for weaving and the wood of the palm tree is also used for construction of the houses, the roofs and those are long term constructions. The whole palm or half of the palm can be put as a bridge on a footpath. Zidana	And of all these trees you have mentioned, which ones are the most adaptable to the regions? Gondwe	All the indigenous fruit trees are adaptable to the region. If you say they are indigenous then they are adaptable because they have been there for all the years. So what we should be differentiating is, where are these adaptable? So we have fig tree, adapted to wetter parts or along the rivers. But there are also trees which are adapted to the dry areas like baobab and like tamarindus. If they are planted in the right areas they will be adapted to the whole region. Zidana	During problems like droughts, when you look at the two species, the exotic one and the indigenous fruit trees, do you see any difference in terms of performance, production, when there is drought? Gondwe	Yes, the indigenous fruit trees will perform better when there is drought. Most of these exotic fruit trees rely on high water injections, but indigenous fruit trees will do very well even if there is a drought. Of course they will also do much better when there is good moisture. Zidana	There is a general fear that these trees may go for good because many people use firewood for cooking in their homes. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>should</b> be done to make sure that these species are maintained and preserved? Gondwe	Farmers who have already seen the value of indigenous fruit trees should start planting these trees. Because the problem will be extinction of these indigenous fruit trees and then the countries are over-run by the exotic ones. But ones a problem comes, like a pest or like a disease, then we have a problem that exotic ones might be extinct within a short time. Zidana	Do you see any improvement on soil fertility improvement, as well as the environment in general when people start planting indigenous fruit trees in their homes? Gondwe	Yes at ICRAF we would encourage farmers to plant indigenous fruit trees. For soil fertility yes, but also for the environment in general. We have tamarindus which is a fertility improving tree, so that can be planted within the farm, by dispersing it within the farm or along the boundaries, around the contours. But we also encourage planting trees in contours or along places where degradation is happening. Fruit trees can be used to preserve the environment or to improve the soil in a lot of ways. We have talked about shade, ornamental, construction, and a lot of economic benefits. Therefore I would encourage all of us to start planting indigenous fruits, to start conserving indigenous fruits and to start training each other or giving information to other about the use of indigenous trees. End of track. How fruit trees can give more than just the fruits...|$|E
