50|$|The general causal pathway {{depends on}} a number of {{variables}} and probabilities. First, the animal must be harboring resistant bacteria and the bacteria have a probability that they can survive from the animal to the dinner table at infectious doses. Humans must then be exposed to these resistant bacteria by eating undercooked meat or coming into contact with them in the environment. Resistant bacteria and their genetic material that codes for resistance are not only found in food, but also the environment. For example, studies have found that resistant bacteria can leak from hog waste lagoons into ground water, creating an exposure through the public water supply. Upon exposure, an individual must <b>develop</b> <b>illness</b> that is severe enough for them to seek medical attention. Factors such as age and immune system condition may influence disease susceptibility, which could impact the severity of disease. If the individual becomes ill and needs medical attention, a physician may prescribe an antibiotic. This pathway depends on the medical doctor’s ability to identify potential antibiotic resistance before prescribing treatment to a patient affected by food-borne illness. If the bacteria causing the illness is resistant to the drug the physician recommended, then the illness will not be improved by the medication. This could potentially lead to increased morbidity and mortality.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Malaria is an {{important}} disease for Australian travellers, particularly to Papua New Guinea. Travellers often seek health advice from their general practitioner before travel or if they <b>develop</b> <b>illness</b> after travel.

None of the 12 individuals who took chemoprophylaxis for the recommended period post-travel developed malaria compared to 4 / 24 travellers who terminated prophylaxis prematurely or 2 / 2 who took no chemoprophylaxis. DISCUSSION: Chemoprophylaxis is effective if taken for the full recommended period following travel to a malaria endemic area; 4 weeks for doxycycline and mefloquine, and 7 days for atovaquone+proguanil.

40|$|OBJECTIVES. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test the supposition that both smoking and consuming alcohol suppress host resistance to viral infections. METHODS. The relations between smoking, alcohol consumption, and the incidence of documented clinical colds were prospectively studied among 391 subjects intentionally exposed to one of five respiratory viruses and 26 subjects given saline. Clinical colds were defined as clinical symptoms verified by the isolation of virus or by an increase in virus-specific antibody titer. Analyses included control variables for demographics; body weight; virus; and environmental, immunological and psychological factors. RESULTS. Smokers were at greater risk for developing colds than nonsmokers because smokers were more likely both to develop infections and to <b>develop</b> <b>illness</b> following infection. Greater numbers of alcoholic drinks (up to three or four per day) were associated with decreased risk for developing colds because drinking was associated with decreased illness following infection. However, the benefits of drinking occurred only among nonsmokers. CONCLUSIONS. Susceptibility to colds was increased by smoking. Although alcohol consumption did not influence risk of clinical illness for smokers, moderate alcohol consumption was associated with decreased risk for nonsmokers...|$|E
40|$|Infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) {{has been}} linked to various {{gastro-intestinal}} diseases; nevertheless it remains to be clarified why only a minority of infected individuals <b>develop</b> <b>illness.</b> Studies from the West have indicated that the cagA gene and the associated EPIYA genotype of H. pylori is closely linked to the development of severe gastritis and gastric carcinoma; however, as yet no consistent correlation has been found among the bacteria from East Asia. In addition to genotype variation, the CagA protein undergoes fragmentation; however, the functional significance of fragmentation with respect to H. pylori infection remains unknown. In this study, we isolated 594 H. pylori colonies from 99 patients and examined the fragmentation patterns of CagA protein using immunoblotting. By analyzing the ability of the isolates to induce the host cell morphological transition to the highly invasive hummingbird phenotype, we demonstrated that H. pylori colonies with substantial CagA fragmentation are less potent in terms of causing this morphological transition. Our results uncovered a functional role for CagA fragmentation with respect to H. pylori-induced hummingbird phenotype formation and these findings suggest the possibility that the post-translational processing of CagA may be involved in H. pylori infection pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|No single {{animal model}} for severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) reproduces {{all aspects of}} the human disease. Young inbred mice support SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication in the respiratory tract and are available in sufficient numbers for statistical evaluation. They are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, but their use in SARS research is limited because they do not <b>develop</b> <b>illness</b> following infection. Older (12 - to 14 -mo-old) BALB/c mice develop clinical illness and pneumonitis, but they can be hard to procure, and immune senescence complicates pathogenesis studies. We adapted the SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) by serial passage in the respiratory tract of young BALB/c mice. Fifteen passages resulted in a virus (MA 15) that is lethal for mice following intranasal inoculation. Lethality is preceded by rapid and high titer viral replication in lungs, viremia, and dissemination of virus to extrapulmonary sites accompanied by lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and pathological changes in the lungs. Abundant viral antigen is extensively distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes, and necrotic cellular debris is present in airways and alveoli, with only mild and focal pneumonitis. These observations suggest that mice infected with MA 15 die from an overwhelming viral infection with extensive, virally mediated destruction o...|$|E

A sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay for anti-Norwalk virus blocking activity was applied to whole serum and to separate IgM and IgG fractions obtained by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. The peak IgM response occurred at about 2 weeks after illness, but IgM was detectable at lower titers for up to 21 weeks after infection. The IgM response was seen in volunteers who became ill, whether or not prechallenge total serum antibody was present. On long-term (27 to 42 months) rechallenge, volunteers who were previously ill and had produced IgM antibody again developed illness, and a secondary IgM response greater than the first was detected. Inoculated volunteers who did not <b>develop</b> <b>illness,</b> as well as previously ill volunteers on short-term rechallenge (4 to 14 weeks), usually failed to generate an IgM response, whether or not an IgG response had occurred. In ill subjects, the rise in IgM and IgG occurred concomitantly.

For persons not previously vaccinated, the median effectiveness in preventing disease with vaccination at 0 – 6 h, 6 – 24 h, and 1 – 3 days after exposure was estimated as 93 %, 90 %, and 80 %, respectively, and effectiveness in modifying disease among those who <b>develop</b> <b>illness</b> was estimated as 80 %, 80 %, and 75 %, respectively.

An environmental investigation was conducted that consisted of reviewing beef handling practices at a specific local supermarket and obtaining ground beef samples from the store and two households with case-patients.
