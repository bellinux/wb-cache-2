5000|$|There were an {{estimated}} 50-100 Australians {{fighting in the}} country as of January 2014, with total calculations for the war reaching about 200 fighters. About six {{were reported to have}} died and the others were suggested as having returned home. In Sydney and Melbourne, in particular, opponents and supporters of the government have resorted to beatings, assaults, shootings and property, largely along sectarian lines. There were more than 15 incidents of violence involving members of the Lebanese, Turkish and Syrian communities, although in 2013 it had decreased from the previous year. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) reported {{at the end of the}} year: [...] "The situation in Syria, with the potential for violence spilling into other parts of the Middle East, increases the possibility of associated communal violence in Australia and remains a concern for ASIO." [...] Zaky Mallah, the first person to be charged and acquitted under Australia's anti-terrorism laws, suggested: [...] "The majority of Australians heading to Syria are from Lebanese backgrounds. The Lebanese youth here <b>feel</b> <b>disadvantaged,</b> isolated and discriminated against. Many are unemployed and have turned to religion as a result." [...] After the death of a couple from western Sydney in the country, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison suggested those fighting in Syria could risk losing their citizenship, while the Australian Federal Police added that those returning from the fighting would be considered a national security threat. ASIO confiscated the passports of those it suspected of travelling to engage in [...] "politically motivated violence;" [...] from mid-2012 to mid-2013 18 passports were confiscated. Former Victoria Multicultural Affairs Commissioner and founder of the Australian Arabic Council Joseph Wakim said:"The new coalition government has been critical of both sides and sympathetic to the Christian minorities who have been targeted by the anti-Assad [...] forces. With Australia's suite of anti-terror laws, and concerted efforts by our intelligence agencies to share resources and establish strategic community contacts, Australia's buffer against terrorist acts has been bolstered. Local community elders and clerics have also been more vigilant and public in encouraging good citizenship and close cooperation with authorities, including denouncing potential terrorists. Australian fighting in Syria had a perceived moral duty to aid their Muslim brothers to rid Syria of an infidel secular authoritarian regime and replace it with one that upholds their brand version of pure Islam.

50|$|One of {{the primary}} {{treatments}} in the Galatea, and most evident in the contrast between Elicio and Erastro, is the perception of rural and city folk and their lives. Elicio, a cultured shepherd, and Erastro, a rústico ganadero (rustic herdsman) are an odd pair of friends, and throughout the novel their differing views come out in conversations with other characters. Erastro, though from the rural parts of Spain, is very eloquent in speech — a trait that surprises many. However, because of his background, Erastro <b>feels</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> in his desire for Galatea, who had a very cultured upbringing similar to Elicio’s. A similar discussion ensues {{when a group of}} soldiers meets the group and one of them, Darinto, describes his view of pastoral (or rural) life as being a simple one, without all the complications, formalities and expenses of city life. Damón replies that the rural life is not as glorious or desirable as Darinto imagines: there are just as many chores and other things to do in country life as in city life, and so is not the relaxing simple life described.|$|R

The nephew composes and teaches music with some success but <b>feels</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> by his name and is jealous of his uncle. Eventually he sinks into an indolent and debauched state. After his wife's death, he loses all self-esteem and his brusque manners result in him being ostracized by former friends. A character profile of the nephew is now sketched by Diderot: {{a man who was}} once wealthy and comfortable with a pretty wife, who is now living in poverty and decadence, shunned by his friends. And yet this man retains enough of his past to analyze his despondency philosophically and maintains his sense of humor. Essentially he believes in nothing—not in religion, nor in morality; nor in the Roussean view about nature being better than civilization since in his opinion every species in nature consumes one another. [...] He views the same process at work in the economic world where men consume each other through the legal system. The wise man, according to the nephew, will consequently practice hedonism: [...] Hurrah for wisdom and philosophy!--the wisdom of Solomon: to drink good wines, gorge on choice foods, tumble pretty women, sleep on downy beds; outside of that, all is vanity.|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the use of women in the labour market under current circumstances in Benesov region. As a woman living in Benesov region, I will possibly look for a job there too, and that is why I have chosen this theme. The thesis focuses on the situation of unemployed women in Benesov region, {{as well as on the}} attitudes of these women to this situation. The thesis is divided into two parts theoretical part and practical part. In the theoretical part, I defined terms connected to unemployment: the reasons of unemployment, the division of unemployment and the results of unemployment. I also focused on terms that are important for the unemployment of women, such as the gender, the feminism, the feminization of poverty, the status of families in a present-day world and the state policy of employment in terms of gender equality. Benesov region was characterized as well. The aim of the practical part was to clarify the unemployment of women in Benesov region and the woman's attitudes to this topic. Moreover, I have identified a hypothesis, in which I presume that unemployed women in Benesov region without children or with children older than six years <b>feel</b> less <b>disadvantaged</b> in the labour market than women living in Benesov region with children up to six years old. According to the survey, this hypothesis was confirmed. Subsequently, I described the methodology of the thesis. The research was done by a secondary data analysis, a survey and semi-structured interviews which helped to illustrate the topic from the expert's points of view. The data collection was done in the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of the Czech Republic contact office in Benesov. According to the results, under present circumstances women with children up to six years' old <b>feel</b> more <b>disadvantaged</b> in the labour market in Benesov region than women with no children or with children older than six. One of the important questions for confirmation the hypothesis was the question whether the respondent feels included into the group of unemployed that is more in danger of unemployment. During a job interview, women with children up to six years were also more often confronted by questions of their potential employers on their personal lives...|$|R

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{studies have shown}} that the {{integration}} of the LGBT community into the economic system yields a higher income for the country. In a recent USAID study, it is said that a wide range of scholarly theories from economics, political science, sociology, psychology, public health and other social sciences support the idea that full rights and inclusion of LGBT people are associated with higher levels of economic development and well-being for the country. Also, the acceptance of LGBT people within the office environment can lead to higher income for the company since the people do not <b>feel</b> as <b>disadvantaged</b> and as discriminated as before. Another thing is that a better environment for LGBT individuals can be an attractive bargaining chip for countries seeking multinational investments and even tourists, since a conservative climate that keeps LGBT people in the closet and policymakers from recognizing the human rights of LGBT people will hold their economy back from its full potential. Naturally, passing a non-discrimination law will not immediately lead to a sudden boost in the country's economy, although less discrimination should eventually lead to more output.|$|R
40|$|Studying {{the issue}} of how ethnic groups in Tuva adapt to {{contemporary}} social and economic transformations is of special importance at the moment {{due to the fact that}} Tuva is an ethnically heterogeneous region, and also because {{the issue of}} such adaptation has not been sufficiently studied so far. The ethnic and cultural profile of the population of a certain region is also important for assessing the prospects of its development. In order to study the whole scope of techniques, pace and scale of ethnic groups’ adaptation to the transforming environment, the authors of this article launched and led two public opinion polls (2010 and 2014). A representative sample of 400 residents of Tuva of working age was polled by means of a questionnaire. The analysis of the data thus obtained shows that the adaptation patterns in various ethnic groups (primarily Tuvans and Russians) are different. An additional obstacle ethnic Russians face is that they have to adapt to both new socioeconomic situation and new ethnopolitical reality. While basic value orientations of ethnic Russians and Tuvans are quite similar, in the issues of equality and social mobility Russians, including the younger generation, still <b>feel</b> more <b>disadvantaged</b> than Tuvans. Low confidence in the future cripples their self-esteem, especially concerning career prospects and social mobility. Ethnic Tuvans feel more confident in their future due to their trust in kinship and territorial networks. Nevertheless, the overall adaptation level remains rather low, with a marked prevalence of paternalist expectations and passive outlook. In general, it is quite clear that the level of adaptation to the realities of the new economy does not match the requirements of the region’s social and economic development. The degree of frustration and deprivation among the population of Tuva is still high. Opinion polls show a rise of pro-migration mood: while Russians aim to move out of the region, ethnic Tuvans plan to relocate to the urban areas of Tuva...|$|R

Consequently, they express strong desires for &# 039;exposure,&# 039; which can only be met through migration, particularly to India&# 039;s metropolitan cities.

Using data collected over ten years in West Africa, this study looked at market-oriented urban vegetable production in West Africa and Ghana in particular. Gender disaggregated data on key issues such as access and control of resources, division of tasks, decision-making process and challenges faced was collected from farmers and traders. With several exceptions, a clear gender distinction emerged across the sub-region: men dominate urban vegetable farming, while women manage vegetable marketing. The general differentiation is attributed to societal norms, but other factors play a role as well. Female farmers, for example, feel constrained by existing irrigation practices that are energy-intensive and conflict with household duties. Male farmers, on the other hand, feel significantly oppressed by their dependency on credit and prices dictated by market women, and <b>feel</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> when entering the vegetable retail market.

40|$|Abstract: Evolutionary {{theorists have}} argued that {{perceived}} competitive disadvantage may lead to more positive evaluation of, and greater likelihood of engaging in, risky and antisocial behavior. However, experimental studies have not yet {{examined the effects of}} competitive disadvantage on perceptions of rape. In the current study, we created a manipulation of perceived competitive status to test its effects on beliefs about rape. In one condition, participants were made to <b>feel</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> relative to male peers in terms of financial, physical, and intellectual power, whereas in the other condition they were made to feel advantaged. Participants were 120 heterosexual male undergraduate students. The manipulation was effective; compared to participants in the advantage condition, those in the disadvantage condition rated themselves as significantly worse off financially, shorter, in worse physical shape, and as having lower course marks than the average male student at the university. Compared to perceived competitive advantage, perceived disadvantage led to less negative attitudes towards rape. However, perceived competitive status did not significantly affect justifications and excuses for rape. Future studies using similar experimental manipulations can complement correlational studies and may contribute to greater clarity, precision, and sophistication of research and theory on the role of competitive disadvantage in rape...|$|E

30|$|It is {{also true}} that summative {{assessments}} are often high stakes assessments; thus, there is wariness about imposing additional risks and anxieties, such as involving computers in the assessment process. Investigation of the role of technology and how it might impact on assessment is still in its infancy. Ricketts and Wilks (2002) claim that the speed of marking and immediacy of the availability of feedback are the main reasons students accept computer-based assessment even though they find it difficult to read from a computer screen for long periods of time. The negative association between increased anxiety associated with assessment and academic performance is well-established (e.g., Hembree, 1988; Stobart, 2001). Brosnan (1999) has raised the issue of computer anxiety affecting performance. Engelbrecht and Harding (2004) found that, in the domain of summative assessment, online assessment does not differ significantly from that of paper-based assessment. However, Ricketts and Wilks (2002) reported that some students <b>feel</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> by online examinations because they find these examinations more stressful or because they dislike computers. But the picture is mixed: dyslexic students considered online examinations advantageous to them, and some students found this format less stressful than paper-based exams (see also Clesham, 2010). It should be acknowledged that paper-based approaches to examination cannot avoid differential effects due to situational or other anxieties and that this is yet again a case of e-assessment receiving heightened scrutiny. Nonetheless, understanding how students experience an online assessment environment remains a valid avenue of enquiry.|$|E

40|$|For so many {{important}} outcomes in life, {{there comes a}} point when, having done everything one can to make the desired outcome happen, one must simply sit back and hope things work out. After all the résumé tweaking and hand shaking, the job seeker can only wait for the phone to ring. After all the test preparation and statement crafting, the high-school senior can only scan the mail for the dreaded thin envelope or the prized thick one. After controlling whatever can be controlled, people must eventually turn many outcomes over to “the universe”— some combination of controlling gods, other people’s deci-sions, chance factors, and the fabled flapping of a butterfly’s wings. We suggest that in these moments—when people face out-comes of important life events that are beyond their personal control—rather than waiting passively to learn their fate, peo-ple may act as if they can gain fate’s favor by doing good deeds proactively. Specifically, we propose that the experience of awaiting an important, uncontrollable outcome increases the likelihood that people will do good deeds when confronted with the opportunity, as if they were “investing in karma. ” For instance, job seekers {{may be more likely to}} drop a few coins in a collection jar after interviewing, and students may be more willing to offer a helping hand on days when they find them-selves obsessing about admissions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is {{to prove that the}} sectarian {{division}} in Lebanon is a factor that facilitates the emergence and survival of Salafi Jihadi groups in the country. It shows how the sectarian division, be it on the political or social level, is leading to a malfunctioning political system on the internal level and eventually a weak position in the region, thus making Lebanon more susceptible to Jihadi Islamist groups. The sect-based consociational system of Lebanon makes some sects <b>feel</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> compared to others, thus pushing those subgroups to seek the help of the more radical ideologies. The shared identities across borders import into Lebanon regional and international disputes including sectarian rivalries, which may encourage Salafi Jihadism in the country. Moreover, both the internal deficiency and the external weakness produce deadlock and weak deterrence, making governmental reactions towards extremist activities either slow or not entirely effective. The link that exists between sectarian division, its outcomes and Salafi Jihadism forms a pattern that can similarly be used to look into the increase in sectarian tension in Lebanon since 2005 and the ascendancy of Salafi Jihadism ever since the civil war in Syria began in 2011. Once the uprisings in Syria turned violent, the sectarian division in Lebanon intensified and the country witnessed a rise of Salafi Jihadism.

[...] University of Washington, 2015 This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} performance standards {{used to evaluate}} selected Seattle jazz musicians, {{as well as the}} effects of these standards on musicians’ educational, professional, and community experiences. My study synthesizes theoretical and methodological approaches from ethnomusicology, jazz studies, and other disciplines; draws from interviews with Seattle jazz musicians who studied jazz at a college level; and incorporates my experiences as performing jazz musician, scholar, and educator. I explore issues of authenticity, evaluation, and agency. I argue that individual performers generate their own definitions of jazz musicianship in response to competing standards and notions of authenticity held by instructors, audiences, and other musicians. I show that some performers <b>feel</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> or marginalized by negative evaluations based on certain restrictive criteria. Standards function within technical, conceptual, and social domains of musicianship, as well as in relationship to social categories such as gender and race. Oftentimes, musicians either cannot or do not wish to satisfy evaluative standards – including homogeneous definitions of playing technique rooted in particular notions of talent; static forms of jazz tradition based on certain notions of historical convention; restrictive modes of social presentation tied to specific notions of artistry; and exclusionary social structures reflecting overlapping ideologies of gender and race. This study shows that jazz musicians develop adaptive approaches by making their own choices and by using strategies particular to their musical setting, thereby asserting their agency. These approaches include recognizing tensions, conflicts, and biases in evaluative standards, as well as and taking responsibility for their own musical development. I demonstrate that standards function through processes of acceptance, contestation, or adaptation. While these standards create structural limitations for jazz musicians, they are still able develop their own identities, senses of authenticity, and motivations to continue performing...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} the chapter by Aymar Nyenyezi and An Ansoms (‘Land {{grabbing}} and power relations in Burundi: Practical norms and real governance’) lays on land conflicts that oppose political elites and various groups of ‘ordinary citizens’. This chapter again shows how history shapes contemporary land conflicts. It highlights how patronage networks, clientelism and nepotism have continuously {{played a central role}} in control over land regardless of which elite group held power. In the land conflicts described, the involved actors call upon the broad range of existing normative frameworks: legal provisions, arrangements arising from mediation efforts, provisions from the Arusha Peace Agreement, and customary norms. The chapter also shows that the ‘norms’ that finally prevail in such land conflicts, are ultimately the result of the power play amongst the elites. Competing power holders may back up a weaker group in a land conflict to support their own electorate, or to undermine political adversaries. Competition between different ethnic groups is an important factor, but also rivalries between various political parties play a role. However, people do act when they risk losing their land. Power relations may be modified in response to the contestation strategies developed by subordinate actors at the micro level, in their attempts to turn the odds in the land conflict into their favour. The chapter particularly highlights the importance of reinforcing the agency of subordinate groups in the land arena and the crucial role of civil society organisations and the media in this respect. The chapter on Burundi also shows how central power changes frequently and profoundly, when “the coins of power turn”. This strong influence of shifts in the national-level power constellation upon evolutions in local-level land conflicts also implies that seemingly definite solutions are never final in the heads of people who <b>feel</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> by the outcome of the conflict. When the national-level power constellation changes, the odds in micro-level land conflicts may turn overnight and seemingly settled claims again will be contested...|$|E
