They further argue that influence of inflation is also depicted in considering the real <b>GNP</b> price <b>deflator.</b> High inflation rate interacts with high tax shield incentives and thereby increases the corporate debt financing ratios.|$|R

What is important for the one-quarter-ahead prediction may not be important for the eight-quarter-ahead prediction, and vice versa. The second is that the results imply that there are many important sources of variability for real GNP. It is not the case that one or two sources dominate.

40|$|For {{more than}} a decade the United States has {{experienced}} accelerating inflation. Since late 1971 average prices have risen at a rate of 5 percent per year, measured by the Gross National Product (<b>GNP)</b> <b>deflator,</b> and the wholesale price index of all commodities has risen an average of 14 percent per year. The general inflation has prompted a number of studies concerning its impact on agriculture. Most of the studies were limited to comments on the effects of inflation, rather than monetary actions on agriculture. Nevertheless, if one believes, as I do, that excessive monetary growth is the major cause of inflation, the influence of monetary actions is implied. The impact on agriculture attributed to inflation varied widely in these studies, ranging from real wealth gains to nominal and real wealth losses.

Second, also unlike most (although not all) other related studies, the deficit is expressed in real terms and then divided by the real GNP level; expressing the deficit in this ratio form enables us to judge the deficit relative {{to the size of}} the economy which must finance it.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of ex ante econometric model forecasts of four key macroeconomic variables: real GNP growth, the rate of price inflation measured by the <b>GNP</b> <b>deflator,</b> the civilian unemployment rate, and the Treasury Bill rate. Annual forecasts produced by the Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics (RSQE) based on the Michigan Quarterly Econometric Model of the U. S. Economy are compared with quasi ex ante forecasts from a four-variable vector autoregressive (VAR) model. Statistical ests of the equality of forecast error variances as well as univariate and multivariate forecast encompassing-type tests are conducted. The forecast error variance comparisons indicate that for three of the four variables the RSQE forecasts are more accurate than the VAR forecasts and for one of the variables (real GNP growth) only slightly less accurate. The forecast encompassing-type tests indicate that the RSQE forecasts contain information not contained in the VAR forecasts and, conversely, that VAR forecasts contain information not included in the RSQE forecasts. The scope for improving RSQE forecasts by combining them with VAR forecasts is rather limited, however. (JEL C 32, C 53, E 17) I. In t roduct io...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with the escalation of capital costs of nuclear central station power plants between the early 1960 s and the present. The report presents an historical overview of the development of the nuclear power industry and cost escalation in the industry, using existing data on orders and capital costs. New data are presented on regulatory delays in the licensing process, derived from a concurrent study being carried on in the Social Science group at Caltech. The conclusions of the study are that nuclear capital costs have escalated more rapidly than the <b>GNP</b> <b>deflator</b> or the construction industry price index. Prior to 1970, cost increases are related to bottleneck problems in the nuclear construction and supplying industries and the regulatory process; intervenors play only a minor role in cost escalation. After 1970, generic changes introduced into the licensing process by intervenors (including environmental impact reviews, antitrust reviews, more stringent safety standards) dominate the cost escalation picture, with bottlenecks of secondary importance. Recent increases in the time from application for a construction permit to commercial operation are related not only to intervenor actions, but also to suspensions, cancellations or postponements of construction by utilities due to unfavorable demand or financing conditions...|$|E

Both the all—item consumer price index and the implicit <b>GNP</b> <b>deflator</b> have increased in every quarter since late 1965, and neither seems likely to reach a zero rate of change in the near future. Sustained inflation at the rates of recent years is rare, even if not unique, in the histories of developed economies.

The list is a long one, particularly if we include propositions that once were known but later forgotten or rejected in the years of Keynesian orthodoxy, so I shall not attempt to be complete.

40|$|The most {{important}} economic measures are monetary. They have many different names, are derived in different theories and employ different formulas. Yet, they all {{attempt to do}} basically the same thing: to separate a change in nominal value into a ‘real part’ due to the changes in quantities and an inflation due to the changes of prices. Examples are: real national product and its components, the <b>GNP</b> <b>deflator,</b> the CPI, various measures related to consumer surplus, {{as well as the}} large number of formulas for price and quantity indexes that have been proposed. The theories that have been developed to derive these measures are largely unsatisfactory. The axiomatic theory of indexes does not make clear which economic problem a particular formula can be used to solve. The economic theories are for the most part based on unrealistic assumption. For example, the theory of the CPI is usually developed for a single consumer with homothetic preferences and then applied to a large aggregate of diverse consumers with non-homothetic preferences. In this paper I develop a unitary theory {{that can be used in}} all situations in which monetary measures have been used. The theory implies a uniquely optimal measure which turns out to be the TÃ¶rnqvist index.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} basic nominal stylized facts of {{business}} cycles in the United States using monthly data from 1960 : 1 to 1993 : 4 and the methodology suggested by Kydland and Prescott (1990). Comparisons are made among simple-sum and Divisia aggregates using the Thornton and Yue (1992) series of Divisia monetary aggregates. The robustness {{of the results}} to (relevant) nonstochastic stationarity-inducing transformations is also investigated. Kydland and Prescott (1990) argue that business cycle research took a wrong turn when researchers abandoned the effort {{to account for the}} cyclical behavior of aggregate data following Koopmans’s (1947) criticism of the methodology developed by Burns and Mitchell (1946) as being “measurement without theory. ” Crediting Lucas (1977) with reviving interest in business cycle research, Kydland and Prescott initiated a line of research that builds on the growth theory literature. Part of it involves an effort to assemble business cycle facts. This boils down to investigating whether deviations of macroeconomic aggregates from their trends are correlated with the cycle, and if so, at what leads and lags. Kydland and Prescott (1990) report some original evidence for the U. S. economy and conclude that several accepted nominal facts, such as the procyclical movements of money and prices, appear to be business cycle myths. In contrast to conventional wisdom, they argue that the price level (whether measured by the implicit <b>GNP</b> <b>deflator</b> or by the consumer price index), is countercyclical. Although the monetary base and M 1 are both procyclical, neither leads the cycle. This evidence counters Mankiw’s (1989) criticism of real business cycle models {{on the grounds that they}} do not predict procyclical variation in prices. Moreover, the evidence of countercyclical price behavior has been confirmed by Cooley and Ohania...|$|E

40|$|The major {{economic}} policy {{issue of the}} 1980 s is inflation. Although economists have been writing about inflation for several decades, little {{work has been done}} on the theory of inflation measurement. There is an extensive literature dealing with the statistical aspects of price indices and the inflation phenomenon. However, statistical discussions ignore the economic theory behind inflation measures and inflation discussions fail to address the practical aspect of measurement of inflation. This dissertation develops an inflation measure that overcomes these failings. By combining the principles of price formation found in microeconomic literature with the macroeconomic theory of inflation, an economically appropriate measure of inflation is presented. The measure adopts the Marshallian view that producers fix prices and vary output in response to market conditions. Recognizing that production takes time which leads to uncertainty about the forward delivery market, the measure stresses both labor and material input costs as the prime price determinants. Contracts fix these costs. Current or spot market demand influences prices only in the service sector. This influence is measured and added to the price forming factors determined in oligopoly, monopoly and competitive sectors. The four sectors are combined with a measure of government price influence to generate the measure of inflation. A highly stylized model of this measure is tested monthly for the 1965 - 78 period. The theoretical measure and the model results are then compared to conventional inflation measures. The CPI, <b>GNP</b> <b>deflator</b> and WPI are discussed and their problems as measures of inflation are assessed. The measure proposed and tested here eliminates much of the sampling bias, substitution bias, and quality bias plaguing the others. Being designed as a measure of inflation in the general price level, the proposed measure actually incorporates the broad economic base necessary for a macroeconomic measure. It provides a useful policy guide for inflation management and an appropriate measure of the policy's success...|$|E
