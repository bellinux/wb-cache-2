50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat.</b> (Tadarida teniotis, {{sometimes}} {{given as}} Tadarida insignis) is {{a species of}} free-tailed bat found in the Old World. Other common names include the bulldog bat and the mastiff bat {{because of the presence}} of wrinkling on the snout. This bat is found in the Mediterranean region of Europe and in scattered locations across Asia at altitudes from sea level to 3100 m. It was reported from Korea in 1931, but has not been sighted on the Korean Peninsula since that time. Populations in Japan, Taiwan and Korea are now considered to be a separate species Tadarida insignis.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>European</b> <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> roosts by day in crevices in cliffs, {{in rocky}} gorges, under overhangs, in holes in tall buildings, under roof tiles or under stone bridges. It emerges at dusk and flies {{at a great}} height with a swift direct flight, not exhibiting the sudden twists and turns shown by many other bat species. It feeds on insects caught in flight and seldom needs to drink. When it does drink, it scoops up water from a pond or river while flying low over the surface. Before leaving the roost it makes a {{rattling}} sound and it often emits a characteristic [...] "tsick-tsick" [...] in flight, enabling it to be recognised by sound.|$|E
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> has large, broad ears, {{each with}} a very small tragus, a backward-pointing {{projection}} which helps direct sound into the ear. Its muzzle has wrinkled lips, which gives its face a similarity to a dog's face and is the origin for its common names of bulldog or mastiff bat. Its tail is fleshy and robust, and the rear third is not connected to any membranes. Its fur is short and even, the dorsal (upper) surface is greyish-black, with a brownish shine, while the ventral (under) surface is paler. Its ears, wing and tail membranes are black and it has an unpleasant smell. This bat's head and body length is about 3.5 in, its tail about 2 in and its weight from 1 to 2 oz.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{threat to the}} bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> {{is likely to be}} ongoing land clearing in semi-arid bioregions of Queensland and NSW. The eastern Australian Bioregions that comprise the core range of the bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat,</b> particularly the Brigalow Belt (north and south), have been subjected to broad scale clearing and habitat modification since European settlement. Clearing of vegetation for agriculture and removal of hollow bearing trees for firewood collection and forestry are likely to reduce the availability of roosting sites for the bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat.</b> Clearing of native vegetation and removal of dead wood and dead trees have been recognised as key threatening processes for the bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> in NSW.|$|R
5|$|The {{echolocation}} {{call of the}} bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> {{contrasts with}} all other Australian molossid bats in that it displays a strongly frequency modulated search phase pulse. The bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> also has the highest mean characteristic frequency (36 kHz) of any Australian Mormopterus.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Since April 1983 to March 1990, {{the author}} carried out {{observations}} on the <b>European</b> <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> (Tadarida teniotis) in a suburban house of Latina. The shelter used by the species was located between the outer wall and the flue of the central heating system. The maximum number of specimens observed {{at the same time}} was one male and two females. Some characteristic calls uttered by the male have been noticed. These consisted in several very loud shrill notes often given out in rapid succession. These calls have been heard mainly during the day and at sunset, amid the noise from the city and industries in the surrounding; they lasted about 30 seconds on average (up to 45). These calls were probably given out at times of maximum excitement, perhaps in the pre-mating phase. They were heard more frequently in spring (March-May) but also in autumn (October-November). Flight generally occurred at temperatures no lower than 16 °C and from 25 to 60 minutes after sunset, after characteristic loud calls, and coming its habitual shelter. The presence of the <b>European</b> <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> in this spot may have been influenced by the source of heat represented by the flue, which supplied warmth during the winter months and, at the same time, by the trophic opportunities offered by the vast uncultivated fields in the area, with luxuriant herbaceous vegetation, scattered shrubs and trees, ditches, a few small cane thickets, flooded fields. The flue has not been activated since 1987, but the species has continued to live in the same place until 1590 (last sighting on March 1). The author excludes the presence of the species in the study site before 1983. Riassunto Dall'aprile 1983 al marzo 1990 l'autore ha compiuto osservazioni sul Molosso di Cestoni (Tadarida teniotis), in un'abitazione alla periferia della città di Latina. I 1 ricovero abituale della specie è localizzato tra il muro esterno e la canna fumaria dell'impianto centralizzato di riscaldamento. I 1 numero massimo di esemplari osservati contemporaneamente è stato di un maschio e due femmine. Sono stati rilevati alcuni caratteristici richiami emessi dal maschio in momenti di massima eccitazione, probabilmente nelle fasi pre-copula, principalmente nei mesi primaverili (marzo-maggio) ma anche autunnali (ottobre-novembre). L'involo si è verificato generalmente con temperature dell'aria non inferiori ai 16 °C e da 25 a 60 minuti dopo il tramonto, eccetto in un caso dove un esemplare in volo, alto e diritto, è stato osservato pochi minuti dopo il tramonto del sole e dopo aver ascoltato i forti richiami provenienti dal ricovero abituale della specie...|$|E

50|$|The bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> is {{uncommon}} {{and widely}} dispersed across broad areas of inland Australia, with specimens and records from central Australia and the remote south-western {{corner of the}} Northern Territory, northern South Australia, western and central Queensland and north western NSW. The distribution of the bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> is unusual in that it ranges from extremely arid areas of the central Australian interior, where average annual rainfall is less than abbr=on 200 mm, to areas of the north-eastern Queensland dry tropics where average annual rainfall can exceed abbr=on 1000 mm. In the eastern component of its distribution the bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> occurs {{to the west of}} the Great Dividing Range within the Brigalow Belt (north and south), Mulga Lands, Darling Riverine Plains and Nandewar Biogeographic Regions.In the western component of its distribution the bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> occurs within the Finke, MacDonnell Ranges, Simpson Strzelecki Dunefields and Central Ranges Bioregions.|$|R
500|$|A 1998 genetic {{study of}} species {{boundaries}} in Australian <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bats</b> (Family Mollossidae) {{indicated that the}} bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> (referred to as Mormopterus sp 6) {{was one of a}} group of eight distinct and unresolved genetic groups in the Australian Mormopterus. Mormopterus sp 6 was genetically distinct from all other types, however only a single specimen from central Australia was included in the study. [...] Accumulation of additional specimens (n=24) in Museum collections and targeted trapping facilitated formal description of the bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> in 2008 on the basis of morphology, the results of allozyme electrophoresis and investigation of echolocation call characteristics. Further resolution of the Australian Molossidae has shown that the bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> and the east-coast <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> (Mormopterus norfolkensis) are only distantly related to other Australian Mollosid taxa, and the differences between these two species and remaining taxa in the Mormopterus 'planiceps group lead to the erection of three new subgenera in 2014. These subgenera include Setirostris (Reardon, McKenzie & Adams 2014) for Mormopterus eleryi, Micronomus (Reardon, McKenzie & Adams 2014) for Mormopterus norfolkensis and Ozimops (Reardon, McKenzie & Adams 2014) for the remaining seven Australian taxa and several Indo-Papuan forms formerly in the planiceps group. The subgeneric name Setirostris (seta + rostrum) refers to the characteristic bristles on the face of the bristle-faced <b>free-tailed</b> <b>bat</b> [...] and the specific name eleryi is for Elery Hamilton-Smith in recognition of contributions to bat research and conservation.|$|R
