Investigation revealed that the fatigue cracks have initiated at the weld-parent metal interface and propagated progressively in the circumferential direction.

To understand the complex dynamic interaction of thruster actuation, appendage motion, and spin dynamics, each spacecraft is modeled as a tree of rigid bodies connected by spherical or <b>gimballed</b> <b>joints.</b> The method presented facilitates assembling by inspection the exact, nonlinear dynamic {{equations of motion}} for a multibody spacecraft suitable for solution by numerical integration. The building block equations are derived by applying Newton's and Euler's equations of motion to an "element" consisting of two bodies and one <b>joint</b> (spherical and <b>gimballed</b> <b>joints</b> are considered separately). Patterns in the "mass" and L'force" matrices guide assembly by inspection of a general N-body tree-topology system.

40|$|During {{a normal}} {{inspection}} of the main propulsion system at Kennedy Space Center, small cracks were noticed near a slotted region of a <b>gimbal</b> <b>joint</b> flowliner located just upstream {{from one of the}} Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME). These small cracks sparked an investigation of the entire Space Shuttle fleet main propulsion feedlines. The investigation was initiated to determine the cause of the small cracks and a repair method that would be needed to return the Shuttle fleet back to operation safely. The cracks were found to be initiated by structural resonance caused by flow fluctuations from the SSME low pressure fuel turbopump interacting with the flowliner. The pump induced backward traveling wakes that excited the liner and duct acoustics which also caused the liner to vibrate in complex mode shapes. The investigation involved an extensive effort by a team of engineers from the NASA civil servant and contractor workforce with the goal to characterize the root cause of the cracking behavior of the fuel side <b>gimbal</b> <b>joint</b> flowliners. In addition to working to identify the root cause, a parallel path was taken to characterize the material properties and fatigue capabilities of the liner material such that the life of the liners could be ascertained. As the characterization of the material and the most probable cause matured, the combination of the two with pump speed restrictions provided a means to return the Shuttle to flight in a safe manner. This paper traces the flowliner investigation results with respect to the structural dynamics analysis, component level testing and hot-fire flow testing on a static testbed. The paper will address the unique aspects of a very complex problem involving backflow from a high performance pump that has never been characterized nor understood to such detail. In addition, the paper will briefly address the flow phenomena that excited the liners, the unique structural dynamic modal characteristics and the variability of SSME operation which has ultimately ensured the safe and reliable operation of the shuttle main engines for each flight...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} motion of a large, flexible shallow spherical shell in a circular orbit is presented. For small elastic displacements and attitude angles the linearized equations for the roll and yaw (out-of-plane) motions completely separate from the pitch (in-plane) and elastic motions. However, the pitch and only the axisymmetric elastic modes are seen to be coupled in the linear range. With the shell's symmetry axis following the local vertical, the structure undergoes a static deformation {{under the influence of}} gravity and inertia. Further, the pitch and roll motions are unstable due to the unfavorable moment of inertia distribution. A rigid lightweight dumbbell with heavy tip masses and connected to the shell at its apex by a spring loaded double <b>gimbal</b> <b>joint</b> is proposed to gravitationally stabilize the structure. It is noted that the dumbbell motion can excite only those elastic modes having one nodal diameter. A sensitivity study of the system response characteristics to the key system parameters is carried out...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{describes}} an on-going effort {{that focuses on}} the appli-cation of finite-element multibody procedures to the dynamic analysis of tilt rotors.

In fact, multibody formulations can deal with complex flexible mecha-nisms of arbitrary topologies: a given mechanism is modelled through an idealization process that identifies the mechanism components from within a large library of elements implemented in the code. Each element provides a basic functional building block, for example a rigid or flexible member, a hinge, a motor, etc. After assembling the various elements, one can construct a virtual prototype of the mechanism with the required level of accuracy.

40|$|In May of 2002, three cracks {{were found}} in the {{downstream}} flowliner at the <b>gimbal</b> <b>joint</b> in the LH 2 feedline at the interface with the Low Pressure Fuel Turbopump (LPFP) of Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) # 1 of Orbiter OV- 104. Subsequent inspections of the feedline flowliners in the other orbiters revealed the existence of 8 additional cracks. No cracks {{were found in}} the LO 2 feedline flowliners. A solution to the cracking problem was developed and implemented on all orbiters. The solution included weld repair of all detectable cracks and the polishing of all slot edges to remove manufacturing discrepancies that could initiate new cracks. Using the results of a fracture mechanics analysis with a scatter factor of 4 on the predicted fatigue life, the orbiters were cleared for return to flight with a one-flight rationale requiring inspections after each flight.

40|$|The {{design process}} of {{unmanned}} ISR systems has typically driven {{in the direction}} of increasing system mass to increase stabilization performance and imagery quality. However, through the use of new sensor and processor technology high performance stabilization feedback is being made available for control on new small and low mass stabilized platforms that can be placed on small UAVs. This project develops and implements a LOS stabilization controller design, typically seen on larger gimbals, onto a new small stabilized gimbal, the Tigereye, and demonstrates the application on several small UAV aircraft. The Tigereye gimbal is a new 2 lb, 2 -axis, gimbal intended to provided high performance closed loop LOS stabilization through the utilization of inertial rate gyro, electronic video stabilization, and host platform state information. Ground and flight tests results of the LOS stabilization controller on the Tigereye gimbal have shown stabilization performance improvements over legacy systems. However, system characteristics identified in testing still limit stabilization performance, these include: host system vibration, <b>gimbal</b> <b>joint</b> friction and backlash, joint actuation compliance, payload CG asymmetry, and gyro noise and drift.

40|$|Equations {{of motion}} are derived {{for a general}} {{spacecraft}} composed of rigid bodies connected via rotary (spherical or <b>gimballed)</b> <b>joints</b> in a tree topology. Several supporting concepts are developed in depth. Basis dyads aid in the transition from basis-free vector equations to component-wise equations. Joint partials allow abstraction of 1 -DOF, 2 -DOF, 3 -DOF gimballed and spherical rotational joints to a common notation. The basic building block consisting of an "inner" body and an "outer" body connected by a joint enables efficient organization of arbitrary tree structures. Kane's equation is recast in a form which facilitates systematic assembly of large systems of equations, and exposes a relationship of Kane's equation to Newton and Euler's equations which is obscured by the usual presentation.

40|$|A {{proposed}} {{method for}} controlling {{the shape and}} orientation of very large shallow dish type receiver/reflectors {{to be used in}} communication, radiometry and in electronic orbital based mail systems involves connecting a rigid light weight dumbell with heavy tip masses to the shell at its apex by a spring loaded double <b>gimballed</b> <b>joint</b> with dampling. To completely damp the system transient motion in all of the important lower frequency modes, an active control system is required. A mathematical model is extended to include the effects of point actuators located at preselected positions on the shell surface.

As an example, three rigid body modes and six elastic modes are included in the model and six actuators are assumed, none of which lies on a nodal line or circle...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a multi-body {{analysis of the}} 1 / 5 scale wind tunnel model of the V- 22 tiltrotor, the Wing and Rotor Aeroelastic Testing System (WRATS), currently tested at NASA Langley Research Center. An original multi-body formulation has been developed at the Dipartimento di Ingegneria Aerospaziale of the Politecnico di Milano, Italy. It {{is based on the}} direct writing of the equilibrium equations of independent rigid bodies, connected by kinematic constraints that result in the addition of algebraic constraint equations, and by dynamic constraints, that directly contribute to the equilibrium equations. The formulation has been extended to the simultaneous solution of interdisciplinary problems by modeling electric and hydraulic networks, for aeroservoelastic problems. The code has been tailored to the modeling of rotorcrafts while preserving a complete generality. A family of aerodynamic elements has been introduced to model high aspect aerodynamic surfaces, based on the strip theory, with quasi-steady aerodynamic coefficients, compressibility, post-stall interpolation of experimental data, dynamic stall modeling, and radial flow drag. Different models for the induced velocity of the rotor can be used, from uniform velocity to dynamic in flow. A complete dynamic and aeroelastic analysis of the model of the V- 22 tiltrotor has been performed, to assess the validity of the formulation and to exploit the unique features of multi-body analysis with respect to conventional comprehensive rotorcraft codes; These are the ability to model the exact kinematics of mechanical systems, and the possibility to simulate unusual maneuvers and unusual flight conditions, that are particular to the tiltrotor, e. g. the conversion maneuver. A complete modal validation of the analytical model has been performed, to assess the ability to reproduce the correct dynamics of the system with a relatively coarse beam model of the semispan wing, pylon and rotor. Particular care has been used to model the kinematics of the <b>gimbal</b> <b>joint,</b> that characterizes the rotor hub, and of the control system, consisting in the entire swashplate mechanism. The kinematics of the fixed and the rotating plates have been modeled, with variable length control links used to input the controls, the rotating flexible links, the pitch horns and the pitch bearings. The investigations took advantage of concurring wind tunnel test runs, that were performed in August 1998, and allowed the acquisition of data specific to the multi-body analysis...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{mechanism}} (mechanical moving component) failures and anomalies have recently occurred on satellites. In addition, more demanding operating and life requirements have caused mechanism failures or anomalies to occur even before some satellites were launched (e. g., during the qualification testing of GOES-NEXT, CERES, and the Space Station Freedom Beta <b>Joint</b> <b>Gimbal).</b> For these reasons, {{it is imperative}} to determine which mechanisms worked in the past and which have failed so that the best selection of mechanically moving components can be made for future satellites. It is also important to know where the problem areas are so that timely decisions can be made on the initiation of research to develop future needed technology.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis addresses {{the problem of}} computing rapid slew maneuvers for a spacecraft antenna mounted on a double-axis <b>gimbal</b> with elastic <b>joints.</b> The performance of the system can be enhanced by designing antenna maneuvers in which the flexible effects are properly constrained, thus reducing the load on the spacecraft control system. The motion of a mass-spring-damper system is shown to be analogous to a spacecraft antenna slew with linear dynamics. This model is extended to a nonlinear double-gimbal mechanism with flexible joints, which better represents real spacecraft antenna dynamics. Rather than increase maneuver times to control flexible motion, this thesis presents optimal solutions that decrease maneuver times while allowing designers to easily constrain flexibility. Since {{it is impossible to}} recast the nonlinear system into a modal representation, an innovative approach is used to map the nonlinear dynamics into a linear system with a fictitious force. The fictitious force captures the effects of the nonlinearities so the vibrational motion can be constrained for a time-optimal slew. It is shown that by constructing an appropriate optimal control problem, the maneuver time for a flexible DGM can be decreased by approximately 42 % compared to a conventional computed torque control solution.
