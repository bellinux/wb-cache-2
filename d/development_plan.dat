40|$|Thesis (PhD (School of Public Management and Planning)) —University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Most of {{the less}} {{developed}} countries are engaging in development projects to address the development needs of their citizens. Yet the record of success of these projects is not high. The ‘crisis in development planning’ has been under scrutiny for some time so that ways may be found of improving the <b>development</b> <b>planning</b> process. <b>Development</b> <b>planning</b> requires reliable quantities of information of an acceptable quality. In particular geo-spatial information {{should be used in}} <b>development</b> <b>planning.</b> However, there is evidence of poor usage of geo-spatial information in <b>development</b> <b>planning.</b> There is a need to review the <b>development</b> <b>planning</b> process, in particular the decision-making process, particularly where information and knowledge are used. A proposed new <b>development</b> <b>planning</b> process is presented, emphasizing the role of information and knowledge, as well as capacity and capacity-building in a community participative process. From evidence presented in this research it is concluded that there is a significant relationship between geo-spatial information and <b>development</b> <b>planning.</b> A Geo-spatial Information Decision-making Model is developed, emphasizing the relationship between geo-spatial information, spatial knowledge and the decision-making process within the environment of the <b>development</b> <b>planning</b> process. This is an information / knowledge-centric model, with the objective of optimizing rationality in the decision-making process [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Risk-sensitive {{development}} {{is an essential}} component of building resilient communities. It provides an opportunity for sustaining development investment as well as reducing future risks at community level. <b>Development</b> <b>plans</b> should integrate disaster and climate risk information systematically, to overcome increasing challenges of disaster and climate risks and to optimise the use of resources for effective delivery of development outcomes. While <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> identify needs and priorities of communities, the process of formulating <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> itself intends to empower communities. Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) integrated development strategies will enable state and non-state stakeholders to implement risk-informed actions in disaster prone areas. Formulation of risk-sensitive village and regional <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> has been promoted in the recent Community Resilience Framework of Sri Lanka. This paper presents an approach and process in developing risk-sensitive <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> in a pilot project in the Northern Sri Lanka moving from stand-alone DRR initiatives to risk-sensitive development. Key lessons from the pilot project include: involvement of local authorities from the outset of the risk-sensitive <b>development</b> <b>planning</b> process; formulating a system to monitor the complete risk-sensitive <b>development</b> <b>planning</b> process; and creating a community of practice to promote risk-sensitive <b>development</b> <b>planning</b> at divisional level for future upscaling...|$|R

Development, considered as socio-economic growth and prosperity, represents today the paramount goal of all nations. Many countries regard national <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> as the main tool for programming and accelerating <b>development</b> <b>planning.</b> Information {{plays an important role}} in this. <b>Development</b> <b>planning</b> needs a specialized information and documentation service which, if adequately organized, could facilitate and improve the quality of <b>development</b> <b>planning.</b> The main goals of this research were to gain a comprehensive understanding of <b>development</b> <b>planning</b> information needs, to investigate the role of a documentation centre specialized in <b>development</b> <b>planning,</b> and to find the way for improving the necessary information and documentation base for more efficient <b>development</b> <b>planning.</b> The study was based on the Development Documentation Centre in Sierra Leone. The main characteristics of <b>development</b> <b>planning</b> process in this West African Country and its corresponding information needs were examined and elaborated. An emphasis was put on the role of Development Documentation Centre in meeting the specific information and documentation needs of development planners in the Ministry of National <b>Development</b> and Economic <b>Planning</b> in Sierra Leone. This is a case study based on the experience of one country. However, similarity of living and working conditions with other developing countries allows that conclusions drawn here could have some wider implications...|$|R
