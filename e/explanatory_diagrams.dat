This makes possible the direct comparison of the accurate solution of explicitly finite equations with the solution of renormalized equations containing counterterms. The numerically efficient way of solving iteratively these latter equations is obtained by deriving at each order of the iteration new counterterms which evolve during the iteration process towards the counterterms determined based on the asymptotic behavior of the converged propagator. As shown at different values of the coupling, the use of these evolving counterterms accelerates the convergence of the solution of the equations.

Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) is the most effective photocatalyst for decomposition of organic contaminants in water resources due to its high photoactivity for the production of hydroxyl radical, low cost, chemical inertness, and low toxicity. However, TiO 2 is only activated by ultraviolet light. Accordingly, many {{attempts have been made to}} extend the available range to the visible-light area by metal and non-metal doping, dye photosensitization and so on. In the first part of study, 2 -ethylimidazole-TiO 2 (N-doped TiO 2) photocatalyst was synthesized by a simple method by 2 -ethylimidazole as the specific nitrogen source, and its photocatalytic activity was examined for degradation of microcystin-LR under visible light irradiation because harmful cyanobacterial toxins (e. g., microcystins) have raised concerns about the safety of drinking water resources. The synthesized photocatalyst was compared to other N-doped TiO 2 materials reported in previous studies for the photocatalytic activity. In the second part of study, Co-H 2 O 2 -TiO 2 can be synthesized using the precursor, TTIP (Titanium Tetraisopropoxide), and hydrogen peroxide. Additionally, the efficiency of H 2 O 2 -TiO 2 in visible light rage was experimentally confirmed through the previous study.

Here, we demonstrate that the underlying problem, the low intrinsic conductivity, can be overcome by working in a field-effect geometry. We present high resolution surface topographies obtained by STM on pentacene organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). By virtue of the OFET geometry, the hole accumulation layer that is present at sufficiently negative gate bias acts as back contact, collecting the tunnelling current. The presence of a true tunnelling gap is established, as is the need for the presence of an accumulation layer. The tunnelling current vs. tip bias showed rectifying behaviour, which is rationalized in terms of the tip acting as a second gate on the unipolar semiconductor.

40|$|The term “Integral Abutment Bridges” is used broadly {{all over}} the world these days. While the {{expansion}} joints used in bridges were once a scientifically proved cure to the problem of natural expansion and contraction, there are the excessive maintenance costs being accumulated annually due to the deterioration of essential functions from deicing chemicals and debris. This drawback triggered the advent of Integral Abutment Bridges. The performance of Integral Abutment Bridges at almost no extra costs in seasonal and daily cyclic contraction and expansion can be assessed as a monumental landmark of civil engineering technologies with respect to the massive budget reductions. However, since Integral Abutment Bridges are destined to expand or contract under the laws of nature, the bridge design became more complicated and sophisticated in order to complement the removal of expansion joints. That is why numerous researchers are attracted to Integral Abutment Bridges with deep interests. Accordingly, in designing the piled abutments of Integral bridges, it is essential to precisely predict the bridge’s behavior in advance. Researchers have been broadly carried out during the last several decades on the behavior of piled bridge abutments. However, most of the studies have been analyzed with focus on structural elements or soils, respectively for the static and dynamic loads such as thermal variations and earthquake loads. This presented research developed 3 D numerical models with 3 m, 4 m, 5 m, 6 m, 7 m, and 8 m-tall abutments in the bridge using the finite element analysis software MIDAS CIVIL that simulate the behaviors of Integral Abutment Bridges to study the soil-structure interaction mechanism. In addition, this work evaluated and validated the suitability to the limit of the abutment height in Ontario’s recommendations for Integral Abutment Bridges by a parametric study under the combined static loading conditions. In order to be a balanced research in terms of a multidisciplinary study, this research analyzed key facts and issues related to soil-structure interaction mechanisms with both structural and geotechnical concerns. Moreover, the study established an <b>explanatory</b> <b>diagram</b> on soil-structure interaction mechanisms by cyclic thermal movements in Integral Abutment Bridges...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to draw upon psychological contract theory to examine solicitors’ perceptions of expectations and obligations. Socialisation processes and the role of Organisational Citizenship Behaviours (OCB) were explored in relation to promotion to partnership. Context is important as law firms have a different ownership structure to other commercial organisations and employ professionals. The legal profession is changing (Empson, 2007 a) due to the increasing size of firms and the changing aspirations of those entering the profession. A mixed method approach to researching these issues was adopted. The research was conducted in two stages. Stage One comprised telephone interviews with 128 solicitors to complete a questionnaire and Stage Two comprised 34 in-depth semi-structured interviews. These interviews were analysed using QSR N 6 (NUD*IST) software. The research makes a contribution {{to the understanding of the}} psychological contract of professionals in two main areas: theoretical and practical. The utility of a promissory based approach to the psychological contract (Conway and Briner, 2005) is critically examined. The role of OCB is considered in terms of what behaviour can be seen as in-role and what as extra-role and how to identify discretionary behaviour. The results from the quantitative analysis in the study revealed a high degree of similarity in the responses. One explanation proposed is that the process of socialisation experienced by solicitors engenders assumptions about appropriate behaviour and thus expectations are defined and communicated. The research led to the production of two <b>explanatory</b> <b>diagrams</b> of the psychological contract of solicitors. The first typology examines the influences upon the contract and the interactions of expectations and obligations. The second schema examines the impact of promotion to partnership upon work satisfaction. The implications of these for the management of law firms are discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the author {{examines}} the evolution, manufacture, and societal significance of zoomorphic penannular brooches, {{a type of}} metal dress fastener used in early medieval Ireland that is often decorated. The brooches examined are dated to the 6 th and 7 th centuries, during which the Irish underwent a process of religious conversion from Celtic paganism to Christianity, and social rank was paramount. It is in this social context that the brooches are examined. Despite {{the significance of this}} time of social change, brooches from this period tend to be overlooked by scholarship in favor of the more ornate metalwork of the 8 th and 9 th centuries. The author begins by discussing the origin and evolution of the zoomorphic penannular brooch form, and the motifs used to decorate it. This is followed by an explanation of the brooch in early medieval Irish society, based on an examination of early Irish law and literature. The author took measures to make the field of Medieval Irish metalwork more accessible to scholars outside of Ireland and the UK. The study is presented in a clear manner that is accessible to the outsider, and provides <b>explanatory</b> <b>diagrams</b> and a glossary of terms frequently used in the discipline. In order to amend the lack of high quality images of brooches from this period, the author has provided images of fourteen brooches from the period, 11 of which she handled and photographed at the National Museum of Ireland and the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore. The thesis includes a catalogue of six of these brooches, complete with detailed photos and formal analyses. By way of her research, the author has made the study of 6 th and 7 th century zoomorphic penannular brooches more accessible to scholars who are outsiders to the field, with the aim of encouraging research of these items during this fascinating time of religious and cultural transition.

40|$|The {{performance}} of devotional music in India {{has been an}} active, sonic conduit where spiritual identities are shaped and forged, and both history and mythology lived out and remembered daily. For the followers of Sikhism, congregational hymn singing has been the vehicle through which text, melody and ritual act as repositories of memory, elevating memory {{to a place where}} historical and social events can be reenacted and memorialized on levels of spiritual significance. This dissertation investigates the musical process of Shabad Kirtan, Sikh hymn singing, in a Sikh musical service as a powerful vehicle to forge a sense of identification between individual and the group. As an intimate part of Sikh life from birth to death, the repertoire of Shabad Kirtan draws from a rich mosaic of classical and folk genres as well as performance styles, acting as a musical and cognitive archive. Through a detailed analysis of the Asa Di Var service, Shabad Kirtan is explored as a phenomenological experience where time, place and occasion interact as a meaningful unit through which the congregation creates and recreates themselves, invoking deep memories and emotional experiences. Supported by <b>explanatory</b> tables, <b>diagrams</b> and musical transcriptions, the sonic movements of the service show how the Divine Word as Shabad is not only embodied through the Guru Granth Sahib, but also encountered through the human enactment of the service, aurally, viscerally and phenomenologically...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by advances in {{our knowledge of the}} structure of working memory that under some circumstances, effectively more processing capacity is available to learners if instructional materials use multiple information modes, (e. g., auditory and visual) instead of equivalent single mode formats. From a cognitive load (Sweller, 1988, 1989, 1993, 1994, 1999; Chandler & Sweller, 1991, 1996; Sweller, van Merrienboer & Paas, 1998) perspective, this thesis examined; a) the conditions under which this "modality" effect could be obtained and b) investigated the conditions under which dual modalities may be an ineffective instructional technique. The first four experiments used map reading and the interpretation of graphs as instructional material and compared an audio/visual format with visual only instructions. It was predicted that the additional processing capacity provided in an audio/visual format would enhance learning when compared to equivalent visual only formats. Results from these studies indicated that a dual-mode presentation was superior to equivalent visual only presentations. In these experiments, the maps or graphs were not self contained. For the students who participated in Experiments 1 to 4, both the graphs and explanatory text (presented either in a visual or audio form) was essential to render the material intelligible. The final two experiments, Experiments 5 and 6, using the interpretation of graphs as instructional material, examined a variation to the presentation formats of Experiments 1 to 4. According to cognitive load theory, if a source of instructional material is fully intelligible in isolation (e. g., selfcontained diagram), then any additional information may impede rather than enhance learning. Experiments 5 and 6 provided evidence that an explanatory text which was supposedly helpful but not essential, presented aurally, with a self-contained diagram, actually hindered learning when compared to a diagram only format, thus demonstrating a redundancy effect. The thesis also examined the conditions under which differences between instructional groups were most pronounced. In accordance with cognitive load theory, it was predicted that the strongest difference between instructional groups would be in areas testing high complexity information generated by a high level of interaction between learning elements. High element interactivity is imposed when learning elements must be processed simultaneously rather than sequentially (see Sweller and Chandler, 1994) and therefore creating a high cognitive load leaving fewer resources for learning. Results from Experiments 4 and 5 provided some support for a cognitive load hypothesis that differences in instructional formats are more important in areas of high element interactivity. Specifically in Experiment 4, instructional group differences were found on test questions tapping high element interactivity information (elements of information that could only be learned simultaneously) but not for low element interactivity items (elements of information that could be learned sequentially). Overall, the thesis demonstrated when information is CQ!!Piex for students; a) a visual map or diagram combined with essential auditory text is preferable to an equivalent visual only format (Experiments 1 to 4) and alternatively, b) if diagrammatic information is already self <b>explanatory,</b> <b>diagram</b> only instructions are superior to an audio/visual format which requires students to attend to redundant unnecessary text (Experiments 5 and 6) ...|$|R

A particular fo-cus of our algorithm is to depict the underlying flow patterns effec-tively and succinctly with a minimum set of streamlines. To achieve this goal, 2 D distance fields are generated to encode the distances from each grid point in the field to the nearby streamlines. A local metric is derived to measure the dissimilarity between the vectors from the original field and an approximate field computed from the distance fields. A global metric is used to measure the dissimilarity between streamlines based on the local errors to decide whether to drop a new seed at a local point. This process is iterated to generate streamlines until no more streamlines can be found that are dissim-ilar to the existing ones. We present examples of images generated from our algorithm and report results from qualitative analysis and user studies. ...|$|R
