On August 17, 2010, he was convicted on one of the 24 federal charges, a charge of lying to the FBI, and the jury was hung on 23 other counts. The defense did not call a single witness, claiming that prosecutors did not prove their case. Because the jury could not agree on the remaining charges, a mistrial was ordered for those counts. Within <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> mistrial was declared, the prosecution team announced that they would definitely pursue a retrial on the twenty-three mistrial counts.

The aerial attack killed members of the Shalhoub and Hashem families who had used an underground garage below a three-story apartment building as a shelter during the bombing. Initial news reports state that the families were asleep when the two bombs were dropped on their building. While Israel had directed residents of South Lebanon to flee the conflict, roads out of the area were also subject to Israeli bombardment. One of the eight survivors of the blast said that attacks on the roads out of Qana discouraged the two families from leaving.|$|E

The 5th Battalion, of the King's Own Scottish Borderers on the left, was flank guard against the woodlands on the western slope of the ridge, which had been targeted by gas shells during the artillery bombardment, with the 4th Battalion Scots Fusiliers on their right. The 4th Battalion King's Own Scottish Borderers was in support. When the leading troops and the tank reached the gullies between Queen's and Lee's Hills on Es Sire Ridge, the tank nose-dived into a gully.

50|$|Swerve was {{sweeping}} mines off Anzio on 9 July when, at 13:00, {{she struck}} a mine.

25|$|On the bridge, Captain Bartlett {{was already}} {{considering}} efforts {{to save the}} ship, despite its increasingly dire condition. Only two minutes after the blast, boiler rooms five and six had to be evacuated. In about ten minutes, Britannic was roughly in the same condition Titanic had been in one hour after the collision with the iceberg. <b>Fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> ship was struck, the open portholes on E Deck were underwater. With water also entering the ship's aft section from the bulkhead between boiler rooms four and five, Britannic quickly developed a serious list to starboard due to {{the weight of the}} water flooding into the starboard side. With the shores of the Greek island Kea to the right, Bartlett gave the order to navigate the ship towards the island in attempt to beach the vessel. The effect of the ship's starboard list and the weight of the rudder made attempts to navigate the ship under its own power difficult, and the steering gear was knocked out by the explosion, which eliminated steering by the rudder. However, the captain ordered the port shaft driven at a higher speed than the starboard side, which helped the ship move towards the island.|$|E
25|$|Rain {{returned}} to the circuit only <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> race resumed green flag conditions and more chaos ensued; Chandhok of Murphy Prototypes and Michael Munemann of Greaves Motorsport collected one another while spinning exiting Tertre Rouge corner, bringing out the safety cars for the second time. As the rain tapered off and racing resumed once more, the remaining Toyota and pursuing Porsche cars were now on different pit stop sequences, allowing Bernhard and later Hartley to briefly take the overall race lead before Sarrazin in the No. 7 reclaimed the top spot by the fourth hour. Further down the field changes in lead were also happening in other categories. Wet weather tyre strategy from the Dempsey-Proton Porsche failed to pay off as the No. 98 Aston Martin took command in LMGTE Am from the slower Porsche. After the damaged KCMG car relinquished the lead in LMP2, Franck Mailleux's No. 34 Race Performance Oreca and Signatech driver Paul-Loup Chatin traded off the category lead before later being joined by the No. 35 OAK Ligier driven by Alex Brundle. The LMGTE Pro lead became a multi-car battle between representatives {{of each of the}} four manufacturers, with the lead sometimes changing several times per lap. The Porsche 919 Hybrid also suffered its first major problems as the No. 14 of Marc Lieb went to the garage with fuel pressure problems, dropping the car to 51st place before it recovered to sixth.|$|E

They were [...] further north than intended, and instead of an open beach they were faced with steep cliffs and ridges up to around [...] in height. However, the mistake had put them ashore at a relatively undefended area; at Gaba Tepe further south where they had planned to land, there was a strong-point, with an artillery battery close by equipped with two 15cm and two 12cm guns, and the 5th Company, 27th Infantry Regiment was positioned to counter-attack any landing at that more southern point.

Soon after Spartan was hit, another Hs 293 slammed into Samuel Huntington, penetrating to her boiler room before exploding and killing four men. The force of the explosion blew out two of her cargo hatches, launching a jeep into the stricken ship's flying bridge in the process. With no power, and, hence, no way of fighting the fire, Samuel Huntingtons master ordered the ship abandoned, and the crew lowered her lifeboats and headed away from the ship. <b>Fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> bomb's blast, another explosion rocked the ship, throwing a cloud of debris over [...] in the air, and raining shrapnel on ships as far as [...] away.|$|E

The pilots then ran out to their aircraft with speaker Treacy saying [...] "Go, go, go!" [...] In the haste that the morning had become, not all the jets had been refueled and a majority of the jets were still unarmed. The handful of jets that were armed were sent up with one or two missiles. The standard missile load involves at least two missiles at launch.

500|$|North Korean 120-mm. {{mortar fire}} was already falling on {{battalion}} {{as it moved}} out. For [...] it encountered only sporadic small arms and machine gun fire; then North Korean rifle fire became intense and preregistered mortar fire came down on the troops, slowing the advance. On the left, men in L Company could see approximately 400 North Koreans preparing to counterattack. They radioed for an air strike but the designated planes {{were on the ground}} refueling. The troops were still able to repulse the counterattack with combined artillery, mortar, and small arms fire. The air strike came in at 14:00, blanketing the top and the north slope of the ridge. By this time North Korean mortar fire had caused many casualties, and elements of L and I Companies became intermingled. But, in contrast to the action on Hill 518, the men continued the attack largely of their own volition after many of the officers had become casualties. Many of the officers in the companies were wounded but refused evacuation and simply continued the attack. <b>Fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> air strike, the 3rd Battalion resumed its attack toward the crest. As it neared it the North Koreans came out of their positions in a violent counterattack and engaged at close quarters. Some men gained the crest but North Korean mortar and machine gun fire drove them off. They reached it a second time but could not hold it. Another air strike hit the North Koreans. Then, a third time, the company commander led his men to the top. The men scrambled up a 60-degree slope for the last stretch to the top, where they closed with the North Koreans and overran their positions. The remaining men of the two US companies secured the hill and then reorganized jointly. There were fewer than 40 effectives left in L Company and about 40 in I Company; the latter had lost all its officers.|$|E

The results indicate that for both uptick and downtick block trades the stock prices adjust within a <b>fifteen</b> <b>minute</b> period <b>after</b> <b>the</b> block trade. Moreover, for uptick blocks {{there is no evidence}} of any stock price reaction before the block trade. However, the adjustment of stock price for downtick blocks begins about <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> before the block trade. They also find that option price behavior differs considerably from stock price behavior. Specifically, the authors' results suggest that options exhibit abnormal price behavior starting thirty minutes before the block and ending one hour <b>after</b> <b>the</b> block. The pattern is more pronounced for downtick blocks and for put options. The authors interpret this abnormal price behavior of options before the block trade as consistent with intermarket frontrunning. Copyright 1992 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R
