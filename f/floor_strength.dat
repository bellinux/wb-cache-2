50|$|Each Major League Roller Hockey PRO {{regulation}} game {{is played}} between two teams and is 34 minutes long. The game is composed of two 17-minute halves with an intermission of either one minute between the halves. At {{the end of the}} 35-minute regulation time, the team with the most goals wins the game. If a game is tied after regulation time, a 5-minute overtime ensues with the <b>floor</b> <b>strength</b> 3 on 3. If no winner is declared, four shooters for each team, in turn, take a penalty shot. The team with the most goals during the four-round shootout wins the game. If the game is still tied after the four shootout rounds, the shootout becomes sudden death. Whichever team ultimately wins the shootout is awarded a goal in the game score and thus awarded two points in the standings. The losing team in overtime or shootout is awarded only one. Shootout goals and saves are not tracked in hockey statistics; shootout statistics are tracked separately.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> {{after the}} modified pelvic reconstruction procedure for pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Materials and methodsPatients {{were assigned to}} two groups consisting of 37 patients diagnosed with POP and undergoing modified pelvic reconstruction (reconstruction group), and 30 patients admitted to our hospital {{during the same period}} for other surgical indications (control group). Vaginal palpation of pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> was performed according to the modified Oxford grading system before operating on the two groups and again in the 3 rd month following surgery for the reconstruction group. A comparative study was performed to evaluate {{the differences between the two}} groups and the improvement of pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> in the reconstruction group. ResultsThe pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> was significantly improved postoperatively when compared with preoperative results in the reconstruction group (t = − 17. 478, p <  0. 001). However, pre- and postoperative muscle strength in the reconstruction group was significantly lower relative to the control group, respectively (χ 2  =  63. 293, p <  0. 001; χ 2  =  31. 550, p <  0. 001). ConclusionThe modified pelvic reconstruction procedure could improve pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> in POP patients, which remains lower when compared with the normal population.

40|$|Aim. To {{compare the}} {{measurements}} of women`s pelvic <b>floor</b> musculature <b>strength</b> (PFMS) during pregnancy and postpartum period. Background. Pregnancy and childbirth {{can have an}} influence on the muscles and pelvic floor and can cause morbidities of women`s genito-urinary tract. Design. A prospective cohort study. Methods. There were included 226 primigravidae women, attended by community health services {{in the city of}} Itapecerica da Serra, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The participants were followed in four stages: (1) within 12 weeks of pregnancy; (2) between 36 - 40 weeks of pregnancy; (3) within 48 hours after childbirth; (4) 42 - 60 days after childbirth. Data were collected from February 2007 -August 2008. The pelvic <b>floor</b> musculature <b>strength</b> was evaluated by perineometry and digital vaginal palpation in stages 1, 2 and 4. The final sample included 110 women who completed all four stages of the study. Results. The pelvic <b>floor</b> musculature <b>strength</b> of the women did not change significantly during pregnancy or after delivery (anova: p = 0 center dot 78). In all three examined stages, a low-intensity pelvic <b>floor</b> musculature <b>strength</b> was prevalent (in mmHg: stage 1 = 15 center dot 9; stage 2 = 15 center dot 2, stage 4 = 14 center dot 7), with scores from 0 - 3 on the Oxford scale. The pelvic <b>floor</b> musculature <b>strength</b> did not differ in relation to maternal age, skin colour, conjugal status, dyspareunia, stool characteristics, type of delivery, or conditions of the perineum. An interaction between maternal nutritional state and newborn`s weight may affect the pelvic <b>floor</b> musculature <b>strength</b> (manova: p = 0 center dot 04). Conclusion. Pregnancy and childbirth did not reduce significantly pelvic <b>floor</b> musculature <b>strength.</b> The perineometry and digital vaginal palpation used to assess the pelvic <b>floor</b> musculature <b>strength</b> were well accepted by the women. Relevance to clinical practice. In clinical practice, digital vaginal palpation is effective for supporting the diagnosis of urinary, intestinal and sexual dysfunctions. Perineometry use is particularly important together with the performance of perineal exercises with biofeedback in the treatment these disorders.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> {{before and}} after vaginal birth. Design Prospective repeated measures study. Setting Main district hospital. Population Fifty-five women: 25 primiparae and 20 multiparae following vaginal birth, and 10 women following elective caesarean delivery as a control group. Methods Pelvic muscle strength was evaluated by palpation, perineometry and perineal ultrasound before childbirth in the 36 th to 42 nd week of pregnancy, three to eight days postpartum and six to ten weeks postpartum. Main outcome measures Pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> on palpation, intravaginal squeeze pressure and vesical neck elevation during squeeze. Results Pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> is significantly reduced three to eight days postpartum in women following vaginal birth but not in women after caesarean delivery. Six to ten weeks later palpation and vesical neck elevation on perineal ultrasound do not show any significant differences to antepartum values, while intravaginal pressure on perineometry remains significantly lower in primiparae, but not in multiparae.

5000|$|A Kegel perineometer or vaginal {{manometer}} is {{an instrument}} for measuring the strength of voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor muscles. Arnold Kegel (1894-1981) was the gynecologist who invented the Kegel Perineometer (used for measuring vaginal air pressure) and Kegel exercises (squeezing of {{the muscles of the}} pelvic floor). This followed the observation that muscles of the pelvic floor inevitably weakened following the trauma of childbirth. [...] Ascertaining the air pressure inside the vagina by insertion of a perineometer, while requesting the woman to squeeze as hard as possible, indicates whether or not she would benefit from strengthening the vaginal muscles using the Kegel exercises. More modern electromyograph (EMG) perineometers, which measure electrical activity in the pelvic floor muscles, may be more effective in this purpose. [...] Assessment of pelvic <b>floor</b> <b>strength</b> during gynaecological examination may help to identify women with fascial defects of the pelvic floor, as well as those at risk of genital prolapse or urinary incontinence. Both the Kegel perineometer and a digital examination are effective and concordant in their results in this assessment.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} uterine fundal pressure during {{the second stage of}} labor (Kristeller maneuver) on pelvic floor dysfunction (urinary and anal incontinence, genital prolapse, pelvic <b>floor</b> <b>strength).</b> METHODS: 522 primiparous women, enrolled 3 months after vaginal delivery, were divided in two groups: group A (297 women) identifies the women who received Kristeller maneuvers with different indications (e. g. fetal distress, failure to progress, mother exhaustion), group B (225 women) the women without maneuver. Participants were questioned about urogynecological symptoms and examined by Q-tip test, digital test, vaginal perineometry and uroflowmetric stop test score. RESULTS: Mediolateral episiotomies, dyspareunia and perineal pain were significantly higher in Kristeller group, whereas urinary and anal incontinence, genital prolapse and pelvic <b>floor</b> <b>strength</b> were not significantly different between the groups.

Pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> was subjectively evaluated using transvaginal digital palpation. Pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> was objectively assessed using a portable perineometer. All of the parameters were evaluated simultaneously in G 1 and were evaluated in G 2 during the 20 (th) and 36 (th) weeks of pregnancy and 45 days after delivery. RESULTS: In G 2, 14 women were excluded because they left the study before the follow-up evaluation. The median age was 23 years in G 1 and 22 years in G 2; {{there was no significant}} difference between the groups. The average body mass index was 21. 7 kg/m(2) in G 1 and 25. 0 kg/m(2) in G 2; there was a significant difference between the groups (p = 0. 0004). In G 2, transvaginal digital palpation evaluation showed significant impairments of pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> at the 36 (th) week of pregnancy (p = 0. 0006) and 45 days after vaginal delivery (p = 0. 0001) compared to G 1.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{benefits}} of a 12 -week abdominal and pelvic floor muscle strength training programme for the treatment of mild stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in obese women. Thirty obese female patients with mild SUI were randomly divided into two groups: the abdominal exercise (ABD) group and the pelvic floor exercise (PF) group. The participants were evaluated for vaginal pressure, leak point pressure (LPP) and waist–hip ratio (WHR) before, immediately after and at a 12 -week follow-up after the termination of treatment. The ABD group showed a significant increase in vaginal pressure immediately after the intervention and at follow-up (p <  0. 001), while the PF group showed no significant change in this variable. The ABD group also showed a significant increase in LPP after 12 weeks of treatment (p =  0. 008), while the PF group demonstrated no significant change in the same variable (p =  0. 030). At 24 weeks, the LPP remained significantly different from the baseline only for the ABD group (p =  0. 005).

Methods: A prospective cohort of nurse-midwifery patients consented to mapping of genital trauma at birth and an assessment of postpartum pelvic floor outcomes. Women completed validated question-naires for perineal pain and urinary and anal incontinence at 12 weeks postpartum and underwent physical examination to assess pelvic <b>floor</b> <b>strength</b> and anatomy at 6 weeks postpartum. Results: One hundred seventy-two of 212 (80 %) eligible women provided follow-up assessment data at 6 or 12 weeks postpartum. Women with an intact perineum (n 89) used fewer analgesics (P <. 002) and had lower pain scores {{at the time of}} hospital discharge than women with second-degree lac-erations (sutured, n 46; unsutured, n 37; intact, n 89) (P <. 02).

40|$|Introduction and hypothesis: Theoretically, tight or strong {{pelvic floor}} muscles may impair the {{progress}} of labor and lead to instrumental deliveries. We aimed to investigate whether vaginal resting pressure, pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength,</b> or endurance at midpregnancy affect delivery outcome. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of women giving birth at a university hospital. Vaginal resting pressure, pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength,</b> and endurance in 300 nulliparous pregnant women were assessed at mean gestational week 20. 8 (± 1. 4) using a high precision pressure transducer connected to a vaginal balloon. Delivery outcome measures [acute cesarean section, prolonged second stage of labor (> 2 h), instrumental vaginal delivery (vacuum and forceps), episiotomy, and third- and fourth-degree perineal tear) were retrieved from the hospital’s electronic birth records. Results: Twenty-three women were lost to follow-up, mostly because they gave birth at another hospital. Women with prolonged second stage had significantly higher resting pressure than women with second stage less than 2 h; the mean difference was 4. 4 cmH 2 O [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 2 – 7. 6], p[*]<[*] 0. 01, adjusted odds ratio 1. 049 (95 % CI 1. 011 – 1. 089, p[*]=[*] 0. 012). Vaginal resting pressure did not affect other delivery outcomes. Pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> and endurance similarly were not associated with any delivery outcomes. Conclusions: While midpregnancy vaginal resting pressure is associated with prolonged second stage of labor, neither vaginal resting pressure nor pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> or endurance are associated with operative delivery or perineal tears.

40|$|Background: Urinary Incontinence is an {{unpleasant}} and most common problem for many adults, mainly {{majority of the}} women in today’s fast life, stress incontinence being the commonest. Weak pelvic floor muscles are mainly responsible for urinary incontinence. It is a distressing and disabling condition mainly affecting the social and psychological well being of an individual. Various forms of pelvic floor muscle exercises are used to reduce the severity of stress urinary incontinence by improving the strength of the pelvic floor muscles. Thus, this study was done to check the effectiveness of the use of Tanzberger Exercises in women with urinary incontinence and their impact on {{the quality of life of}} the women. Method: Twenty women suffering from stress urinary incontinence were selected by convenient sampling method.

40|$|PURPOSE: to {{evaluate}} the effect of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) on female sexual dysfunctions. METHODS: twentysix women with a diagnosis of sexual dysfunction (sexual desire, arousal, orgasmic disorders and/or dyspareunia) were included in a clinical trial with a before/after approach. The assessment was carried out before, during (after five sessions) {{and at the end}} of the treatment (after ten sessions) by two-digit palpation (assessment of pelvic floor muscle, PFM, strength), intravaginal electromyography (EMG) (capture of PFM contraction amplitudes) and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI, a questionnaire for the evaluation of sexual function). The women underwent PFMT in different positions for ten sessions (once or twice a week). For statistical analysis, absolute and relative frequencies were used for clinical characteristics and PFM strength. The Friedman test was used to compare the FSFI domain scores and EMG values, the Student's t-test was used to determine the association between these values and the characteristics of the women, and the Wilcoxon test for percent modification of the EMG. The Mann-Whitney test permitted us to compare these values with clinical characteristics. The Spearman correlation test was used to correlate the EMG values with mean total score. Results were considered statistically significant if p< 0. 05. RESULTS: a significant improvement (p< 0. 0001) of FSFI scores was observed at the end of treatment compared to the values observed before and in the middle of treatment. Regarding the EMG, the amplitudes of tonic and phasic contractions increased significantly during treatment (p< 0. 0001). Pelvic <b>floor</b> <b>strength</b> increased, which 69 % of the women presenting grade 4 or 5 at the end of treatment, with a total improvement of sexual complaints.

40|$|Background: We aim to {{evaluate}} if Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT) delivered {{in primary care}} results in fewer referrals to secondary care for urinary incontinence (UI), thereby reducing the number and associated costs of surgical procedures for UI. Methods / design: The study will consist of two populations – a prevention group and a treatment group who will both be offered PFMT in primary care. The prevention group will consist of parous women aged 25 - 64 attending for a routine cervical smear. Their pelvic floor will be assessed using the Modified Oxford Scale (MOS) and a baseline data form will be completed that asks about the frequency and associated bother of urine leakage. From the answers given, the group will be subdivided into two groups. The first (prevention) group will be subdivided into a primary prevention arm (no symptoms of urinary incontinence and pelvic <b>floor</b> <b>strength</b> ≤ 2 on MOS) and a secondary prevention arm (women reporting symptoms of urine leakage irrespective of MOS). The second (treatment) group will be women of any age {{who may or may}} not have had a vaginal birth presenting to their GP with UI. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews will be conducted with a subset of patients and staff with the aim of identifying barriers and facilitators in delivering PFMT in primary care. Discussion: A recently completed community study showed good outcomes with practice nurse delivery of PFMT. We suggest if this were to be implemented more widely it would reduce the need for referral to secondary care. We believe that this study will show whether implementing a package of PFMT delivered in primary care can treat as well as prevent UI and will also be helpful in exploring the benefits / drawbacks of such implementation, thus providing lessons for implementation in other Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) ...|$|E

Delivery outcome measures [acute cesarean section, prolonged second stage of labor (> 2 h), instrumental vaginal delivery (vacuum and forceps), episiotomy, and third- and fourth-degree perineal tear) were retrieved from the hospital’s electronic birth records. Results: Twenty-three women were lost to follow-up, mostly because they gave birth at another hospital. Women with prolonged second stage had significantly higher resting pressure than women with second stage less than 2 h; the mean difference was 4. 4 cmH 2 O [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 2 – 7. 6], p[*]<[*] 0. 01, adjusted odds ratio 1. 049 (95 % CI 1. 011 – 1. 089, p[*]=[*] 0. 012). Vaginal resting pressure did not affect other delivery outcomes. Pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> and endurance similarly were not associated with any delivery outcomes. Conclusions: While midpregnancy vaginal resting pressure is associated with prolonged second stage of labor, neither vaginal resting pressure nor pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> or endurance are associated with operative delivery or perineal tears. Strong pelvic floor muscles are not disadvantageous for vaginal delivery. Seksjon for idrettsmedisinske fag / Department of Sports Medicin...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objectives: {{to compare}} the pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> in {{primiparous}} women after normal birth and cesarean section, related to the socio-demographic characteristics, nutritional status, dyspareunia, urinary incontinence, perineal exercise in pregnancy, perineal condition and weight of the newborn. Methods: this was a cross-sectional study conducted after 50 - 70 postpartum days, with 24 primiparous women who underwent cesarean delivery and 72 who had a normal birth. The 9301 PeritronTM was used for analysis of muscle strength. The mean muscle strength was compared between the groups by two-way analysis of variance. Results: the pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> was 24. 0 cmH 2 O (± 16. 2) and 25. 4 cmH 2 O (± 14. 7) in postpartum primiparous women after normal birth and cesarean section, respectively, with no significant difference. The muscular strength was greater in postpartum women with &# 8805; 12 years of study (42. 0 ± 26. 3 versus 14. 6 ± 7. 7 cmH 2 O; p= 0. 036) and in those who performed perineal exercises (42. 6 ± 25. 4 11. 8 ± 4. 9 vs. cmH 2 O; p = 0. 010), compared to caesarean. There {{was no difference in}} muscle strength according to delivery type regarding nutritional status, dyspareunia, urinary incontinence, perineal condition or newborn weight. Conclusion: pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> does not differ between primiparous women based on the type of delivery. Postpartum women with normal births, with higher education who performed perineal exercise during pregnancy showed greater muscle strength...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) on female sexual dysfunctions. Twenty-six women with a diagnosis of sexual dysfunction (sexual desire, arousal, orgasmic disorders and/or dyspareunia) were included in a clinical trial with a before/after approach. The assessment was carried out before, during (after five sessions) {{and at the end}} of the treatment (after ten sessions) by two-digit palpation (assessment of pelvic floor muscle, PFM, strength), intravaginal electromyography (EMG) (capture of PFM contraction amplitudes) and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI, a questionnaire for the evaluation of sexual function). The women underwent PFMT in different positions for ten sessions (once or twice a week). For statistical analysis, absolute and relative frequencies were used for clinical characteristics and PFM strength. The Friedman test was used to compare the FSFI domain scores and EMG values, the Students t-test was used to determine the association between these values and the characteristics of the women, and the Wilcoxon test for percent modification of the EMG. The Mann-Whitney test permitted us to compare these values with clinical characteristics. The Spearman correlation test was used to correlate the EMG values with mean total score. Results were considered statistically significant if p< 0. 05. A significant improvement (p< 0. 0001) of FSFI scores was observed at the end of treatment compared to the values observed before and in the middle of treatment. Regarding the EMG, the amplitudes of tonic and phasic contractions increased significantly during treatment (p< 0. 0001). Pelvic <b>floor</b> <b>strength</b> increased, which 69 % of the women presenting grade 4 or 5 at the end of treatment, with a total improvement of sexual complaints. The PFMT improved muscle strength and electromyography contraction amplitudes, with improved sexual function, indicating that this physiotherapy approach may be successfully used for the treatment of female sexual dysfunctions...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: According {{to current}} studies {{approximately}} 10 - 41 % {{of the female}} population worldwide suffers from stress incontinence (SUI). After exhausting all conservative measures for treatment and clear indication the retropubic trans vaginal tape = TVT or the trans obturator tape = TVTO are the preferred operative interventions. Current publications frequently compare the two surgical options and also describe the occurrence of postoperative pain in the adductor muscles. None of the investigations looked at pre- and postoperative functional status of the musculoskeletal system. Question: What are the retropubic effects of the TVT and the musculoskeletal consequences of the TVTO regarding {{the quality of life}} (QoL), the strength of the pelvic floor muscles and the musculoskeletal system in general? Method: We conducted a clinical prospective study with N= 70 of which 37 patients received a TVTO and 33 patients a TVT. Pre-surgery diagnostic was done. On the day of pre-medication for the surgery and six weeks post operatively a physical therapy evaluation was done which included the following: evaluation of posture and mobility of the spine, diaphragmatic breathing, strength testing of the pelvic floor muscles and manual tests of the pelvic girdle. All patients suffered from a verified dominant 2 nd degree SUI. In addition a visual analog scale (VAS) was used for measuring the QoL. A perineal sonography was done as well as digital grading of pelvic <b>floor</b> <b>strength</b> using the Oxford and Laycock grading scale. Summary: The result of both groups 6 weeks post surgery was as follows: Significant improvement of pelvic floor muscle strength and QoL. No groin or adductor pain unless it was present prior to the surgery. The improved motor control of the pelvic floor muscles can be explained through the phenomenon of muscular neurodynamics and improved mechano-sensitivity of the muscles. In addition, influenced by achieved continence, there might be parasympathetic relaxation. The QoL was improved considerably because of the achieved continence and reduced pain symptoms. After evaluation of the outcomes of both surgeries, they can be equally considered as positive intervention if done with clear indications and by an experienced surgeon...|$|E
40|$|Aims The major aims of {{the study}} were to compare the safety of a {{continuous}} low-dose estradiol-releasing vaginal ring (ESTring) to that of a vaginal estradiol tablet (Vagifem®) on the endometrium and the relief of subjective symptoms and signs of urogenital estrogen deficiency. Quality of life and acceptability of treatment delivery were also assessed. Study design A prospective, randomized study in which women were assigned in a 2 : 1 ratio to ESTring and Vagifem and followed for 12 months. The primary endpoint was endometrial safety, {{based on the results of}} ultrasound measurement of endometrial thickness and a progestogen challenge test at baseline and week 48. Efficacy was determined by subjective assessment of urogenital estrogen deficiency symptoms at baseline and weeks 3, 12, 24, 36 and 48 and assessment of signs of vaginal epithelial atrophy by the clinician at baseline, 12 and 48 weeks. In addition, pelvic <b>floor</b> <b>strength,</b> vaginal cytological evaluation and pH, bacteruria and patient acceptability were assessed. Quality of life was assessed using a menopause-specific quality-of-life questionnire and a 2 -day bladder diary at baseline and 12 and 48 weeks. The comparability of the two groups was assessed using ANOVA, χ(2) or Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s exact tests. Results A total of 126 women were randomized to ESTring and 59 to Vagifem. There was no statistical difference between the groups in the alleviation of symptoms and signs of urogenital estrogen deficiency. Maturation indices increased in both groups, from generally atrophic at baseline to proliferative or highly proliferative at 48 weeks. After 48 weeks of treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in endometrial thickness between the two groups. A statistically smaller proportion of bleeding/spotting occurred in the ESTring group (n = 0) compared to the Vagifem users (n = 4). Estradiol and total estrone serum levels increased during treatment in both groups but remained within the normal postmenopausal range. General health status in both groups was unchanged but the urogenital component of health burden was significantly improved in both groups. Bladder diary variables showed no differences between treatment groups. Conclusion Equivalent endometrial safety and efficacy in the relief of the symptoms and signs of urogenital estrogen deficiency were demonstrated for the 12 months 2 ̆ 7 use of a low-dose estradiol-releasing vaginal ring and a vaginal estradiol tablet...|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} common {{treatment}} recommendations includes exercising the muscles of the pelvis. Kegel exercises to strengthen or retrain pelvic floor muscles and sphincter muscles can reduce stress leakage. Patients younger than 60 years old benefit the most. The patient should do at least 24 daily contractions for at least 6 weeks. It is possible to assess pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> using a Kegel perineometer.|$|R
40|$|Objective To analyze pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> (PFMS), urinary continence {{and quality}} of life related to urinary {{incontinence}} (UI) of women in the first trimester of pregnancy. Method Cross-sectional study with a sample of 500 women who started prenatal care in a complementary healthcare facility in Guarulhos, state of S&# 227;o Paulo, from 2012 and 2013. Pelvic <b>floor</b> muscle <b>strength</b> was evaluated through perineometry. The pregnant women who presented UI answered the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF). Results It was found that maternal age (OR= 1. 06; CI 95 % 1. 02 - 1. 11) and prior UI (OR= 15. 12; 95 %CI 8. 19 - 27. 92) are the variables that, in tandem, best explain the occurrence of UI at the beginning of pregnancy. The mean score on the ICIQ-SF was 8. 2 (SD= 3. 9), considered a moderate impact on quality of life. Conclusion Older pregnant women with prior UI {{are more likely to have}} UI in the first trimester of pregnancy. &# 8233...|$|R
