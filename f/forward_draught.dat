60|$|A man was {{straightway}} despatched {{on horseback}} to Castle Boterel, and the gentleman known as Dr. Granson {{came in the}} course of the afternoon. He pronounced her nervous system to be in a decided state of disorder; <b>forwarded</b> some soothing <b>draught,</b> and gave orders that on no account whatever was she to play chess again.|$|R
50|$|When {{the design}} commenced, {{engineers}} {{knew that the}} beaches where the ships were expected to land would be very flat, {{but it was not}} possible to produce a satisfactory vessel with a 3 ft <b>draught</b> <b>forward,</b> and very little keel slope, so the 1 in 50 keel slope was maintained. It was known that the 1:50 slope would often result in the LST grounding aft on a shallow beach, resulting in the vehicles being discharged into comparatively deep water.|$|R
60|$|After a {{few minutes}} brisk walking he found himself at the further end of the Kleine Hout Straat, there where stood the ricketty, half-mildewed and wholly insalubrious house which had {{previously}} sheltered him. The door as usual was loose upon its hinges and swinging backwards and <b>forwards</b> in the <b>draught</b> with a squeaking, melancholy sound. Diogenes pushed it further open and went in. The same fetid smells, peculiar to all the houses in this quarter of the city, greeted his nostrils, and {{from the depths of}} the dark and dank passage a dog gave a perfunctory bark.|$|R
60|$|Venn was loth to depart, for all {{on earth}} that {{interested}} him lay under this roof. As nobody in the house had any more sleep that night, except the two who slept for ever, {{there was no reason}} why he should not remain. So he retired into the niche of the fireplace where he had used to sit, and there he continued, watching the steam from the double row of bank-notes as they waved backwards and <b>forwards</b> in the <b>draught</b> of the chimney till their flaccidity was changed to dry crispness throughout. Then the woman came and unpinned them, and, folding them together, carried the handful upstairs. Presently the doctor appeared from above with the look of a man who could do no more, and, pulling on his gloves, went out of the house, the trotting of his horse soon dying away upon the road.|$|R
40|$|Tillage {{operation}} in {{loamy sand soil}} for disc ploughing on an experimental plot of twenty different soil moisture levels at tractor forward speeds of 1. 94 m/s, 2. 2 m/s and 2. 5 m/s were conducted using trace tractor techniques. The variables: draw-bar pull force, moisture content, cone index, tractor forward speeds, widths of cut and depths of cut were measured. In determining the effect of moisture content and <b>forward</b> speeds on <b>draught</b> forces, results revealed that at lowest moisture content of 1. 53 % draught forces of 4688. 33 N, 5708. 33 N and 6758. 33 N at tractor forward speeds of 1. 94 m/s, 2. 2 m/s and 2. 5 m/s, were obtained. The draught forces of 3008. 32 N, 4018. 66 N and 5068. os 33 N were obtained at highest moisture content of 24. 14 % with tractor forward speeds of 1. 94 m/s, 2. 2 m/s and 2. 5 m/s. The tractor forward speeds of 2. 5 m/s recorded the highest draught force of 6758. 33 N. The lowest draught forces at respective moisture levels were obtained at tractor forward speed of 1. 94 m/s. It is clear that, draught forces increase with increase in tracto...|$|R
500|$|In 1917, Bayan was the {{flagship}} of Vice Admiral Bakhirev, who now commanded the naval forces defending the Gulf of Riga. During Operation Albion, {{the invasion of}} the Estonian islands of Saaremaa (Ösel), Hiiumaa (Dagö) and Muhu (Moon), in October 1917, the ship defended the southern entrance to Moon Sound on 17 October. When the German minesweepers began clearing the minefields guarding the entrance, they were attacked by Bayan and the predreadnought , while the predreadnought [...] engaged the dreadnoughts [...] and [...] defending the minesweepers. Slava was hit multiple times by the German ships and Bakirev ordered his forces to withdraw. Bayan was the last ship to withdraw, but she was hit once by a [...] shell from König before she moved out of range. The shell penetrated the deck near the forward turret and started a fire among the flammable material in the cable compartment that was not extinguished until the next day. Fragments from the shell destroyed a bulkhead and loosened some plates of the ship's bottom. The location of the fire near the forward magazine forced it to be flooded as a precaution. Between the leaky plates and the flooded magazine, the ship took about [...] aboard and her <b>draught</b> <b>forward</b> increased to [...] The shell killed five men and wounded three more. Despite her increased draught, Bayan was able to pass through the dredged channel connecting the northern and southern parts of Moon Sound later that day. When the general withdrawal was ordered the following day, the ship sailed for Finland.|$|R
