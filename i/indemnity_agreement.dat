Negotiating agreements that govern the shared use of infrastructure can be challenging, especially on issues such as liability and indemnity. As requested, this report discusses (1) the liability and <b>indemnity</b> provisions in <b>agreements</b> among passenger and freight railroads, and the resulting implications of these provisions; (2) federal and state court opinions and Surface Transportation Board (STB) decisions related to contractual liability and indemnity provisions of passenger and freight railroad agreements; (3) factors that influence the negotiations of liability and indemnity provisions among passenger and freight railroads; and (4) potential options for facilitating negotiations of liability and indemnity provisions. GAO obtained information from all existing and proposed commuter rail agencies, Amtrak, and major freight railroads through site visits or telephone interviews. GAO analyzed the liability and <b>indemnity</b> provisions in <b>agreements</b> between commuter rail agencies, Amtrak, and freight railroads. GAO also reviewed federal and state laws, STB decisions, and court cases related to liability and indemnity provisions. The Department of Transportation and STB had no comments on the report.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} the ordinary least squares (OLS) -, M-, MM-, and the Theil–Sen (TS) -estimator for crop yield data analysis in crop insurance applications using Monte Carlo simulations. More specifically, the performance is assessed with respect to trend estimation, prediction of future yield levels, and the estimation of expected <b>indemnity</b> payments. In <b>agreement</b> with earlier findings, other estimators are found to be superior to OLS in simple regression problems if yield distributions are outlier contaminated and heteroscedastic. While this conclusion is also valid for subsequent applications such as yield prediction and the estimation of expected indemnity payments, the difference between the considered estimators becomes less distinct. For these applications, we find particularly the M-estimator to be a good compromise between high-breakdown (very robust) estimators and the very efficient OLS-estimator. Because no regression technique dominates all others in all applications and scenarios for error term distributions, our results underline that the choice of the estimation technique should be dependent on the purpose of the crop yield data analysis. However, alternative estimators such as M-, MM-, and TS-estimator can reduce (and bound) the risk of unreliable or inefficient crop yield data analysis in crop insurance applications...|$|R

50|$|On April 23, 2008, the NFL {{announced}} {{they had reached}} an <b>indemnity</b> <b>agreement</b> with Walsh and had arranged a May 13, 2008 meeting between Walsh and Goodell.

The Patriots and the NFL promised not to sue Walsh and also agreed to indemnify Walsh for any legal expenses involved with the interview process, so long as he complied with the terms of the agreement. Moreover, the agreement stipulated that the NFL would preserve the evidence turned over by Walsh, and that Walsh could retain copies, but could not release those copies to third parties without NFL permission.|$|E
50|$|Nearly {{six months}} after the incident, the Boston Herald reported, citing an unnamed source, that the Patriots had also videotaped the St. Louis Rams' {{walkthrough}} practice prior to Super Bowl XXXVI in February 2002, an allegation denied by Belichick and later retracted by the Herald. Meanwhile, Matt Walsh, a Patriots video assistant in 2001 who was fired after the team's 2002 season, told the media the same week that he had information and materials regarding the Patriots' videotaping practices, but demanded an <b>indemnity</b> <b>agreement</b> before speaking with the NFL. The NFL reached a deal with Walsh on April 23, 2008, and arranged a meeting between Goodell and Walsh. Prior to the meeting, Walsh sent eight videotapes, containing opponents' coaches' signals from the 2000 through 2002 seasons, in accordance with the agreement. Goodell and Walsh met on May 13, 2008, at which time Walsh told Goodell he and other Patriots employees were present at the Rams' walkthrough to set up video equipment for the game but that there was no tape of the walkthrough made; as a result, Goodell told the media no additional penalties would be brought against the Patriots. Less than 24 hours later, the Herald issued an apology for the article about the alleged walkthrough tape.|$|E

40|$|The {{financing}} of a {{geothermal power plant}} has a unique characteristic which is not present with conventional oil, coal, or nuclear power plants and which has slowed development of geothermal resources. That unique characteristic is the increased risk as perceived by utilities, banks and lessors and the unpredictability of those risks as perceived by insurance companies. From a utility company perspective, the increased risk is the potential financial loss to the stockholders in the event the power plant is unable to economically produce electricity due to depletion, scaling or other problems. Such an eventuality {{could result in the}} utility having to ''write-off'' the value of the asset and pass the loss onto the stockholders. Banks, lessors and others share these same concerns for their stockholders; thus, are willing to finance power plants only if most of the financial risk is borne by the utility. Retention of financial risk by the utility can {{take the form of a}} ''hell or high water'' power purchase contract wherein the utility makes payments even when no power is being produced, or an <b>indemnity</b> <b>agreement</b> with a plant lessor wherein the utility agrees to indemnify the lessor in the event he loses any of the tax or income benefits contemplated, or a credit agreement with a bank or other source of funds wherein the utility company's general credit backs up the obligation. As a result of their perception of increased risk, utilities have been searching for ways to reduce the risk to their stockholders by shifting it either to the taxpayer in the form of a DOE grant or DOE loan guarantee, or the rate-payer in the form of Public Utility Commission (PUC) approvals or other sharing. Other potential methods for reducing risk may entail finding a plant lessor or other entity willing to accept some of the risk in exchange for a higher rate of return obtaining insurance; or some combination of DOE loan guarantee, lease and insurance. No attempt has been made to include the viewpoint of municipal utilities in this report. While they and their ratepayers may have the same concerns about the increased economic risks, the sources of financing are substantially different; thus, the risk of loss to the stockholders is not a concern...|$|E
