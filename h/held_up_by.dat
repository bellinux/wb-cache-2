5|$|Polistes nests can be {{built from}} wood fiber which are {{collected}} from posts and plant stems. The fiber is formed into a paper like comb with hexagonal cells. The nests are orientated downward and are <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> one filament. P. exclamans have also been observed occupying artificial nests put out by researchers and consisting of bundles of straws.|$|E
5|$|By 10:00 the 2/4th Somerset Light Infantry, 1/5th Devonshire Regiment, 2/5th Hampshire Regiment, 1/4th Wiltshire Regiment, 2/3rd and 3/3rd Gurkha Rifles (from the 232nd and the 233rd Brigades, 75th Division) were {{advancing}} {{along the}} main road. They occupied the undefended villages of Tall al-Turmus, Qastina and Yazur. The 52nd (Lowland) Division had already occupied Bashshit. The 75th Division proceeded to attack Mesmiye on a lower and southward extension of the ridge on which Qatra and el Mughar were situated with the 52nd (Lowland) Division attacking directly towards these two villages. But these attacks were <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> very strong Ottoman defences.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{eagerness to}} start out again, Amundsen waited until mid-October and the first hints of spring. He was ready to leave on 15October, but was <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the weather {{for a few more}} days. On 19October 1911 the five men, with four sledges and fifty-two dogs, began their journey. The weather quickly worsened, and in heavy fog the party strayed into the field of crevasses that Johansen's depot party had {{discovered}} the previous autumn. Wisting later recalled how his sledge, with Amundsen aboard, nearly disappeared down a crevasse when the snow bridge broke underneath it.|$|E

5|$|<b>Held</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> {{freezing}} {{weather and}} snow storms, LI Corps was approaching Zagreb from the north, and broke through a hastily established defensive line between Pregrada and Krapina. Bicycle-mounted {{troops of the}} 183rd Infantry Division turned east to secure Ustaše-controlled Varaždin. The German-installed NDH government called on all Croats to stop fighting, and in the evening, LI Infantry Corps entered Zagreb and relieved the 14th Panzer Division.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 2016, Jet Airways flight 9W7083 from Bhopal to Mumbai was <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> a {{large group}} of {{passengers}} headed for a marriage in Mumbai. There were allegations from other passengers that the wedding party was politically connected and attempted to coerce the cabin crew to disembark passengers, so that additional members of their party could be accommodated. The airline claimed it was a technical glitch in their booking system which led to overbooking.|$|E
5|$|On October 3, 1945, {{the bill}} was {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives by Congressman Andrew J. May from Kentucky, the chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, and in the Senate by Senator Edwin C. Johnson from Colorado, the ranking member of the Senate Military Affairs Committee. The bill was known as the May-Johnson Bill for its sponsors. May immediately had the bill referred to the Military Affairs Committee, which held hearings on October 9. Bush, Conant and Groves all testified before the committee. But in the Senate Military Affairs Committee, {{the bill was}} <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg.|$|E
60|$|In the train, however, he felt ill. Every {{motion was}} insufferable pain, {{and he was}} sick. He dragged himself from the station into a cab, feeling his way step by step, like a blind man, and <b>held</b> <b>up</b> only <b>by</b> a dim will.|$|R

5|$|Sharks {{tend to be}} seen {{quite often}} in {{cartoons}} whenever a scene involves the ocean. Such examples include the Tom and Jerry cartoons, Jabberjaw, and other shows produced by Hanna-Barbera. They also are used commonly as a clichéd means of killing off a character that is <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> a rope or some similar object as the sharks swim right below them, or the character may be standing on a plank above shark infested waters.|$|E
5|$|St. Leger's {{artillery}} was <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> {{a tactic}} {{that was also}} used to slow down Burgoyne's army {{after the fall of}} Ticonderoga: Gansevoort and his men had systematically felled trees across the wooded track the expedition came down, and St. Leger needed to clear the track to make way for his artillery. This work occupied all but 250 of St. Leger's white men, with the actual encirclement of the fort dominated by Indians.|$|E
5|$|The 8th Brigade {{continued}} their advance without interruption to Jinsafut, which was occupied in the evening. The 1st Battalion, Connaught Rangers (7th Brigade) {{were ordered to}} pass through the 8th Brigade and capture the road junction northeast of El Funduq. Here they captured an artillery column of five field guns, horses, wagons and prisoners which had been <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> fire from the 9th Brigade.|$|E

5|$|The Yeomanry Mounted Division, {{with the}} Anzac Mounted Division in reserve, covered the infantry's left flank. Yibna was {{captured}} by the 8th Mounted Brigade which then advanced northwards against El Kubeibeh and Zernukah. The 22nd Mounted Brigade was <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> Ottoman units defending Aqir while the 6th Mounted Brigade (with the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade protecting their northern flank) was directed against el Mughar.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of new D-class cruisers were canceled {{to make way for}} Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. The provisional names of the planned D-class cruisers, Ersatz Elsass and Ersatz Hessen, were reallocated to the new ships, the contracts for which were awarded to the Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven and the Deutsche Werke in Kiel. Construction was <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> 14months, partly because Hitler wanted to secure the treaty with Britain before work began, and partly due to numerous design changes after the ships had been ordered.|$|E
5|$|The geographical, {{engineering}} and logistical difficulties of conducting operations in SWPA were driven home by Alamo Force's first operation, Operation Chronicle, {{the occupation of}} Woodlark and Kiriwina Islands in June 1943. Despite {{the fact that the}} operation was unopposed by the Japanese, it was subject to delays. Krueger visited Kiriwina, where road work and airbase development were <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> heavy rains, on 11 July. He was dissatisfied with the rate of progress and relieved the task force commander. The arrival of additional engineers sped up the base development effort, and No. 79 Squadron RAAF commenced operations from Kiriwina on 18 August.|$|E

5|$|A full upgrade of {{the station}} {{was carried out in}} 1987. A main {{incentive}} was that the Norwegian Public Roads Administration wanted the station building removed to make room for a new interchange towards Jar. Therefore, Kielland's station building was demolished in 1987. The new station building, designed by NSB Arkitektkontor and Arne Henriksen, was built in glass and concrete with a dominant portal presenting the staircases. On the island platform a new ticket booth was built in steel and glass. The platform was covered by a roof of laminated wood and plywood <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> galvanized steel columns. The roof followed the shape of the curved platform and featured a gable.|$|E
5|$|<b>Held</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> {{freezing}} {{weather and}} snow storms, on 10 April, {{on the following}} day LI Infantry Corps was approaching Zagreb from the north, and bicycle-mounted troops of the 183rd Infantry Division had turned east to capture Varaždin, along with an entire Yugoslav brigade including its commanding general. On the same day, the German-installed interim Croatian government called on all Croats to stop fighting, and in the evening, LI Infantry Corps entered Zagreb and relieved the 14th Panzer Division. In the face of the assault by the 14th Panzer Division, the 4th Army quickly ceased to exist as an operational formation. The disintegration of the 4th Army was caused largely by fifth column activity, as it was involved in little fighting.|$|E
5|$|Higginbotham's {{nomination}} was <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> Mississippi Senator James Eastland, {{the chairman of}} the Senate Judiciary Committee and a committed segregationist. Eastland delayed the nomination long enough so that, despite being passed by a subcommittee, Higginbotham's nomination lapsed following the death of President Kennedy, and {{the beginning of a new}} congressional term. He was ultimately appointed to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by President Lyndon Johnson as a recess appointment on January 6, 1964, and was confirmed by the Senate later that year. At the time of his appointment, he was 35 years old. Higginbotham became a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, of Yale University, and of Thomas Jefferson University.|$|E

The new task force, {{containing}} a reinforced Army contingent commanded by Major General Alfred Terry, arrived at Beaufort on 8 January 1865 but was <b>held</b> <b>up</b> there <b>by</b> bad weather. The ships got underway again on 12 January.|$|R

5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for an attack}} on the Hindenburg Line at Bullecourt, the 1st Australian Brigade—of which the 1st Battalion was part—was attached to the 2nd Australian Division. The attack commenced in the morning of 3 May 1917, with the 2nd Division lined up in conjunction with thirteen other divisions. Despite some progress made early in the attack, the Australian forces were soon <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> strong opposition, and in the evening the 1st Battalion was entrenched in the old German line known as 'OG1'. Three of the battalion's companies occupied the line, while a fourth was placed in reserve. Their position was such that they occupied a wedge into the German line, while two flanks were in German held territory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the planned}} {{offensive}} on the Sangro, C Squadron was {{to follow the}} 19th Armoured Regiment in its advance at 03:00. Although its tanks reached the river, they bogged down {{in the mud and}} the squadron remained on the other bank as B Squadron advanced to Monte Marconi. Three troops from C Squadron finally crossed the river by the afternoon of 29 November; one was ordered to advance to Elici and a second was to make contact with the 8th Indian Infantry Division at La Defenza. The routes were mined and the troops spent the night at 23rd Battalion headquarters. In the morning, the mines were cleared and the second troop contacted the Indians and advanced east of Elici; the first troop was <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> shelling south of Elici.|$|E

They traveled slowly, <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> his ill-health (by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments). They stayed in Kuizhou (in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing) {{at the entrance to the}} Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 766. This period was Du Fu's last great poetic flowering, and here he wrote 400 poems in his dense, late style.|$|E
