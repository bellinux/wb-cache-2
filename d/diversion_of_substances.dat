50|$|The {{rule has}} been written to be {{consistent}} with the above delineated HHS standard. However, {{the context in which the}} HHS standard was issued was not specific to controlled substances and therefore not designed to provide safeguards against the <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> controlled <b>substances.</b> The responsibility for establishing regulatory safeguards against <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> controlled <b>substances</b> falls upon DEA as the agency charged with administering and enforcing the CSA. Accordingly, while the DEA's rule is designed to work in tandem with the HHS standard, its scope is necessarily distinct from the HHS standard.|$|R

Body weight and liver weight have been followed before and after portacaval transposition and control procedures in rats, and the DNA activity ratio studied in the liver of rats after partial hepatectomy in protacavally transposed animals. The {{results suggest that the}} liver atrophy seen after portal diversion is a result <b>of</b> <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> trophic <b>substances</b> in the portal blood rather than of a decrease in absolute liver flow.

40|$|Nonmedical use of {{prescription}} drugs is rising in the United States (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2001; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2011). <b>Diversion</b> <b>of</b> these <b>substances</b> represents a growing problem for law enforcement and public health officials (Cai, R., Crane, E., Poneleit, K., & Paulozzi, L., 2010; U. S. Department of Justice, 2009). This study documents the extent <b>of</b> prescription drug <b>diversion</b> among an understudied population [...] individuals with legitimate prescriptions - and uses Social Learning Theory and Rational Choice Theory to examine risk factors relating to diversion. Participants: Participants {{in this study were}} 502 young adults who had been prescribed a medication in waves 5 through 7 of the College Life Study. The College Life Study is a prospective longitudinal study of a single cohort of young adults that were sampled from a large, public university in 2004. Methods: Diversion behavior was described in detail and differences between diverters and non-diverters were examined. Regression analyses examined the effects of theoretically driven peer and rational choice effects on the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>diversion.</b> Opportunity and perceptions were examined as potential mediators. Results: Individuals with legitimate prescriptions divert a substantial amount of medication. Reasons for refusing to divert, opportunities for diversion, and beliefs about diversion differ between diverters and non-diverters. Regression analyses revealed both peer effects and exposure to information regarding prescription drugs predict diversion. Opportunity mediated the relationship between perceptions <b>of</b> peer <b>diversion</b> and likelihood <b>of</b> <b>diversion.</b> Conclusions: Support for both social learning and rational choice approaches to diversion was found. Additional research is warranted to continue to explore risk and protective factors relating to diversion. Implications for the field are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the pathogenesis of any infectious process, it is obviously necessary to have knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>substances</b> produced in the tissues by the micro-organisms which may play active roles in the disease. In the past, such substances have been detected by much effort, or by chance. When they have been discovered, evidence regarding the production of such materials in vivo during the infection has often been obtained by examining human patients for antibody response to these products. It has been pointed out previously (1 - 3) that the use of precipitin analysis in agar furnishes a valuable tool for estimating the total number of antibody responses which occur as a result of infection. This in turn, of course, reflects the total number of antigens or toxins secreted by the infecting agent in vivo. The use of human antibodies automatically restricts our studies to those antigens formed in vivo, and prevents <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> interest to <b>substances</b> produced by the micro-organism in cultures alone. The use of these precipitin technics also furnishes the tool for following the isolation, purification, and eventual characterization of each of the antigen...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: The {{objective}} of Nigerias fertilizer subsidy scheme was to make&# 13; inorganic fertilizers {{readily available to}} farmers at affordable prices in order to boost food production&# 13; in the country. Shortly into the scheme, farmers complained that fertilizers were not received at the&# 13; time of need and in sufficient quantities. Approach: Using Ondo State, Nigeria as a case study, to&# 13; determine; inter alia, if the farmers complaints were founded and if so, to design alternative ways of&# 13; administering the scheme such that the lofty goals {{for which it was}} established could be realized. &# 13; Methodology: Primary data were collected from 596 farmers randomly selected from the state. &# 13; Secondary data were collected from purposively selected NAFCON, AISC, ADP, FPDD (now FFD) &# 13; and a published book source. The primary data were analyzed with the use of descriptive statistics such&# 13; as percentages and means. The secondary data were analyzed with the use of OLS and TLS regression&# 13; methods. Results: The descriptive analyses showed that farmers in Ondo State did not receive their&# 13; fertilizer supplies in sufficient quantities and at the time of need, despite the fact that supply surpassed&# 13; adoption (demand) for most years of the study period. The inferential analyses showed that a subsidy&# 13; introduced into NAFCON and other producing firms production processes would engender increased&# 13; output and induce fertilizer prices to fall in Ondo State. Conclusion: These results showed that farmers&# 13; in Ondo State did not receive their fertilizer supplies at the time of need and in sufficient quantities due&# 13; to leakages and <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>substance</b> from the vast bureaucratic distribution channels. As an&# 13; alternative, if subsidy was administered through the producing firms production processes, output of&# 13; fertilizers would have increased making the market supply curve of fertilizers to shift to the right. This&# 13; would have also caused the price of fertilizer to fall in the state...|$|R
40|$|There are no uniform {{protocols}} in the United States for safe, {{environmentally acceptable}} disposal <b>of</b> controlled <b>substances</b> by patients. In addition, there are conflicting protocols used by various institutions for {{the disposal of}} narcotic medica-tions. Although the US Drug Enforcement Administration oversees the prescribing, acquisition, and distribution <b>of</b> controlled <b>substances</b> and works to prevent the illegal diver-sion of these products, it stops short of recommending spe-cific mechanisms for consumers to dispose of unused med-ications.

40|$|Opioids are {{extremely}} effective in managing cancer pain, and now are utilized {{for longer periods}} of time in cancer patients as the treatment for malignancies has become more successful. [1] The goals in cancer pain treatment includes maintaining function in patients with cancer pain (especially in earlier stage disease), and palliation in advanced disease. [1] The perception of the lay public and inexperienced clinicians that addiction is inevitable, often leads to an inappropriate fear to utilize opioids to appropriately manage pain; resulting in persistent under-treatment of cancer pain internationally. [2],[3] There is much confusion about the phenomenon of physical dependence and how this can be differentiated from the maladaptive behaviors that constitute a diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> abuse. The burden of cancer and associated cancer pain is projected to continue to rise, and is often at an advanced stage at diagnosis in less developed countries. [4] To be able to provide quality care for this patient population availability of opioids and skilled clinicians in pain management is paramount. In the majority of cases, the main concern is to abate concerns about risks of opioid addiction; to allow adequate pain relief. To understand the infrequent phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> abuse in the setting of cancer pain management clear definitions are needed, and review of the epidemiology of occurrence in cancer populations is needed. It is also important to clearly separate the issues <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> abuse at the patient level and <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> prescribed opioids. There are principles of managing cancer pain in the rare clinical scenario when the risk <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> abuse is high, which can still allow safe management of cancer pain with opioids...|$|R
