5|$|In 1987, {{the city}} drafted a new master plan, {{also known as}} the Growth Management Guide 2000, which would {{transform}} downtown Flagstaff from a shopping and trade center into a regional center for <b>finance,</b> <b>office</b> use, and government. The city built a new city hall, library, and the Coconino County Administrative Building in the downtown district, staking an investment by the local government for years to come. In 1992, the city hired a new manager, Dave Wilcox, who had previously worked at revitalizing the downtown areas of Beloit, Wisconsin and Missoula, Montana. During the 1990s, the downtown area underwent a revitalization, many of the city sidewalks were repaved with decorative brick facing, and a different mix of shops and restaurants opened up {{to take advantage of the}} area's historical appeal.|$|E

25|$|The CCF was {{committed}} to efficiency-oriented planning. Douglas set up an Economic Advisory and Planning Board (EAPB), a cabinet committee with a supporting secretariat, charged with planning economic development strategies for the province and evaluating overall policies and programs. The EAPB evolved into two new agencies: the Budget Bureau and the Government <b>Finance</b> <b>Office.</b> The former was the secretariat for the Treasury Board, the committee of cabinet in charge of allocating budgetary expenditures. In addition, the Budget Bureau had an Organization and Methods unit, which surveyed the operations of various government departments and made recommendations on how they could be managed more effectively. Budgeting became more than the mechanical exercise of allocating money; it became the meeting point of the decision-making process, where all the Douglas government's diverse priorities were integrated.|$|E

500|$|Since {{the initial}} {{adoption}} of the EagleCash system, it has been augmented by ATM-like kiosks which allow soldiers to add funds to the card without visiting the base's <b>finance</b> <b>office.</b> [...] Originally, this requirement caused long lines to refill cards, reducing {{the utility of the}} system. The conversion to the kiosk system, developed by NCR Corporation, remedied these problems and increased the ability of the system to provide easy cash for soldiers away from home [...] "something we often take for granted, but for soldiers deployed on foreign land, it has always been a challenge". [...] To date, 3.2 million EagleCash and EZpay cards have been issued and used to process 16.5 million electronic transactions valued at over $3.6 billion.|$|E

500|$|The new Constitution {{empowered}} {{the president}} to appoint executive department heads {{with the consent of}} the Senate. Three departments had existed under the Articles of Confederation: the Department of War, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the <b>Finance</b> <b>Office.</b> The Department of War was retained, while the latter two departments became the Department of State and the Department of the Treasury, respectively. The leaders of these three departments constituted the initial positions in Washington's cabinet. In September 1789, Congress established the position of Attorney General to serve as the chief legal adviser to the president. Though the Attorney General did not oversee a department (the United States Department of Justice would be established in 1870), the position nonetheless became a part of the cabinet. Edmund Randolph became the first Attorney General, while Henry Knox retained his position as head of the Department of War and Thomas Jefferson served as the first Secretary of State. For the key post of Secretary of the Treasury, which would oversee economic policy, Washington chose Alexander Hamilton, after his first choice, Robert Morris, declined. Morris had recommended Hamilton instead, writing [...] "But, my dear general, you will be no loser by my declining the secrataryship of the Treasury, for I can recommend a far cleverer fellow than I am for your minister of finance in the person of your aide-de-camp, Colonel Hamilton." [...] Washington's initial cabinet consisted of one individual from New England (Knox), one individual from the mid-Atlantic (Hamilton), and two Southerners (Jefferson and Randolph).|$|E
500|$|A first plenum of the Central Committee also elects {{heads of}} departments, bureaus, central leading groups and other {{institutions}} to pursue its work during a term (a [...] "term" [...] being the period elapsing between national congresses, usually five years). The General Office is the party's [...] "nerve centre", in charge of day-to-day administrative work, including communications, protocol, and setting agendas for meetings. The CPC currently has four main central departments: the Organization Department, responsible for overseeing provincial appointments and vetting cadres for future appointments, the Publicity Department (formerly [...] "Propaganda Department"), which oversees the media and formulates the party line to the media, the International Department, functioning as the party's [...] "foreign affairs ministry" [...] with other parties, and the United Front Work Department, which oversees work with the country's non-Communist parties and other mass organizations. The CC also has direct control over the Central Policy Research Office, {{which is responsible for}} researching issues of significant interest to the party leadership, the Central Party School, which provides political training and ideological indoctrination in communist thought for high-ranking and rising cadres, the Party History Research Centre, which sets priorities for scholarly research in state-run universities and the Central Party School, and the Compilation and Translation Bureau, which studies and translates the classical works of Marxism. The party's newspaper, the People's Daily, is under the direct control of the Central Committee and is published with the objectives “to tell good stories about China and the (Party)" [...] and to promote its party leader. The theoretical magazines Seeking Truth from Facts and Study Times are published by the Central Party School.

2500|$|In Napoleon's Last Campaign, Petre {{posits that}} the Emperor Napoleon {{abandoned}} the guiding principles {{of his previous}} success, which lay in his relentless pursuit of his opponent's main army. In the Saxon Campaign, Napoleon lost sight of his primary objectives, becoming mired in secondary achievements. Petre noted also the vast increase in sheer numbers, {{on both sides of}} the contest, and predicted that in terms of numbers, [...] "we must wait for the wars of tomorrow to see those numbers exceeded." [...] World War I interrupted his work as a military historian; he was recalled from retirement to work in the <b>Finance</b> <b>office</b> of the Munitions Ministry.

2500|$|In August 1995, the {{campaign}} of Republican presidential candidate, Bob Dole, returned the LCR's $1,000 campaign contribution. The campaign returned the contribution after openly lesbian columnist, Deb Price, of the Detroit News, asked about it after she saw it on a public report from the Federal Elections Commission. [...] The campaign sent a written statement to Price saying that Dole was in [...] "100% disagreement with {{the agenda of the}} Log Cabin Republicans." [...] The <b>finance</b> <b>office</b> of {{the campaign}} had solicited the contribution from LCR. At the event where it was given, Dole had personally spoken with LCR's then-executive director, Rich Tafel, about the group and about AIDS legislation it was promoting in the Senate. Weeks earlier, Dole agreed to co-sponsor the legislation after a meeting with Tafel at the campaign's headquarters. [...] It resulted in a front-page story in The New York Times, penned by Richard L. Berke, then-chief political reporter for the daily.|$|E
2500|$|German {{civilians were}} held as [...] "reparations labour" [...] by the USSR. Data from the Russian archives, newly {{published}} in 2001 {{and based on}} an actual enumeration, put the number of German civilians deported from Poland to the USSR in early 1945 for reparations labour at 155,262; 37% (57,586) died in the USSR. The West German Red Cross had estimated in 1964 that 233,000 German civilians were deported to the USSR from Poland as forced labourers, and that 45% (105,000) were dead or missing. The West German Red Cross estimated {{at that time that}} 110,000 German civilians were held as forced labour in the Kaliningrad Oblast, where 50,000 were dead or missing. The Soviets deported 7,448 Poles of the Armia Krajowa from Poland. Soviet records indicated that 506 Poles died in captivity. Tomasz Kamusella maintains that in early 1945, 165,000 Germans were transported to the Soviet Union. According to Gerhardt Reichling, an official in the German <b>Finance</b> <b>office,</b> 520,000 German civilians from the Oder–Neisse region were conscripted for forced labour by both the USSR and Poland; he maintains that 206,000 perished.|$|E
