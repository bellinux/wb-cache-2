5|$|Nikki is {{manipulative}} of Paulo {{and appears}} to care more about the diamonds than her relationship. After the crash, Paulo becomes suspicious Nikki is just using {{him to get the}} diamonds. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> asks him after the crash is the whereabouts of the diamonds, and avoids answering Paulo when he asks if they would still be together if she did not need him to help find the diamonds. Paulo does what Nikki tells him to because of his fear of losing her, which results in their deaths.|$|E
500|$|I {{talked to}} Yoko {{the day after}} he was killed, and the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> said was, [...] "John was really fond of you." [...] The last {{telephone}} conversation I had with him we were still the best of mates. He was always a very warm guy, John. His bluff was all on the surface. He used to take his glasses down, those granny glasses, and say, [...] "it's only me." [...] They were like a wall you know? A shield. Those are the moments I treasure.|$|E
500|$|The {{downloadable}} episode Turnabout Reclaimed {{was written}} by the game designer Yuki Nakamura, {{with the concept of}} [...] "lighthearted fun" [...] to set it apart from the main game. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> decided on was to feature an orca, and have the story take place in an aquarium; it took her several tries to decide {{on the rest of the}} story. One of the scrapped ideas involved the orca stealing treasures from the aquarium and attacking people by the shore during its escape to the sea, with the episode's mystery involving the reason for the orca's behavior. The opening for this draft would have involved guards and detective Fulbright vaguely referring to someone escaping; the intention was that the player would think they were talking about Blackquill, before it was revealed to be the orca.|$|E
6000|$|... "Might {{he never}} have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let him go to Nottingham?" [...] {{was one of the}} <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right," [...] Mary assured him, laughing. [...] "It {{was one of}} the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> mentioned. When I told her that I should ask any one to tea I liked she was {{positively}} indignant." ...|$|R
5000|$|The book chronicles Judy's educational, personal, {{and social}} growth. One of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> does at college {{is to change}} her name to [...] "Judy." [...] She designs a {{rigorous}} reading program for herself and struggles to gain the basic cultural knowledge to which she, {{growing up in the}} bleak environment of the orphanage, was never exposed.|$|R
500|$|When Mitzeee {{realised}} Mercedes was her stalker, Mercedes knocked Mitzeee {{out after}} Mitzeee tries to stab her. Mercedes realised {{that she will}} be blamed for stalking Mitzeee so she stabbed herself to convince people Mitzeee was mad. Metcalfe said the situation was born through [...] "pure desperation". She said that [...] "the thought of Mitzeee, Riley and Bobby as a family together was too much for her to take, and she just saw red. I don't think it's something that Mercedes thought about or planned - she wouldn't have even dreamed of doing it to herself. But at the time, she saw it as the only way out of the situation". Shenton explained that Mitzeee was worried due to the stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine, which as she states [...] "isn't a great combination." [...] Shenton revealed that Mercedes arrived to see Mitzee who [...] "still has no idea who the stalker really is, but as they're talking, Mercedes says something that makes Mitzeee discover the truth - and she's totally shocked. Mitzeee is petrified and picks up a knife in the kitchen. The next thing you know, Mitzeee wakes up after being unconscious [...] The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> sees is Mercedes with a stab wound and there is blood everywhere. Mitzeee doesn't have a clue whether she could have stabbed Mercedes, or if someone else came into the flat and did it".|$|E
2500|$|The family residence, [...] "Calumet Place," [...] Washington, {{in which}} Gen. Logan died, {{was then a}} new and long-desired home, but unpaid for. Friends of the General in Chicago voluntarily raised a fund and put it at Mrs. Logan's disposal. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> did was to secure the homestead, and in it devoted {{what was once the}} studio of an artist and former owner to a [...] "Memorial Hall," [...] where all the General's books, army uniforms, portraits, busts, {{presents}} and souvenirs of life were gathered to form an interesting collection. She gave the collection of memorials, trophies and souvenirs of her husband and only son, Maj. John Alexander Logan Jr., who was killed Nov. 11, 1899, at the Battle of San Jacinto, to the State of Illinois.|$|E

5000|$|Robert Barnard: [...] "Mostly semi-supernatural stories. In this setting, Witness for the Prosecution {{stands out}} as the jewel it is: surely this is the cleverest short story she wrote. Of the others, the best is perhaps The Call of Wings, but that, depressingly, {{was one of the}} very <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> wrote (pre-First World War). In this mode she got no better." ...|$|R
50|$|Right after 9/11, a DJ remixed {{the song}} which was carried on {{stations}} across the country. Jewel {{was in the}} mountains with her longtime boyfriend, Ty Murray, during the attack, and she first heard this version on the radio a few days later—it {{was one of the}} <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> heard. She spoke of this experience at a Borders concert in Ann Arbor, MI prior to the release of Perfectly Clear.|$|R
50|$|The {{very first}} person to pass through Charley was her mother who died giving birth to Charley. Her mother told her she loved her and then passed though Charley. Charley remembers this because her memory extends from {{the day she was}} born. One of the very <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> can recall is the Big Bad, a being {{shrouded}} in darkness who always seemed to be saving her. The books balance humor, romance and suspense.|$|R
6000|$|Next {{morning the}} <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> {{saw was a}} {{beautiful}} bracelet, shining on the table; and while she stood admiring it, she heard the little voice sing,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{dare say}} {{it has been the}} <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> has said to him,' said Albinia. 'She is a noble little creature! But what have you done with them now?' ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> saw on {{entering}} {{the room was}} a dark straw hat, a straw hat with a strong penthouse flap to it, and her heart was immediately softened.|$|E
60|$|The queen, of course, now {{came into}} power again. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>she</b> {{did was to}} release Somerset from his confinement, and {{reinstate}} him as prime minister of the crown.|$|R
5000|$|Alessandra Stanley, {{television}} {{critic for}} The New York Times, {{was not as}} fond of The Evidence. Among the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> mentions is that with the show being set in San Francisco there are no Asian or gay characters, {{not even in the}} background of crowd shots of the first episode. Despite being filmed in San Francisco Stanley found the show to be [...] "no more representative than the 1970s cop show The Streets of San Francisco and might as well be set in Chicago or Kansas City." [...] Stanley described the characters as the [...] "too familiar" [...] tormented guy with his buddy for comic relief.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I know, I know,' said Lily; 'she is {{very sorry}} herself by this time. Of course {{she did not}} mean it, {{but it is the}} <b>first</b> unkind <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> ever said to me. It is very silly, and very unjust to take it seriously, but I cannot help it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|All {{that had}} {{happened}} began to return on Kate's brain in a funny medley; and the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> exclaimed was, [...] "Oh! those poor little fishes, how I must have frightened them!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have taken}} to queer company, Andre," [...] was the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> said to him. [...] "Or else I am mistaken in {{thinking}} that your companion was Mlle. Binet of the Theatre Feydau." ...|$|E
6000|$|The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> saw {{on coming}} out of school was the pony carriage, with Charles and Captain Morville himself. Charlotte, who was all excitement, had time to say, while her sister was out of hearing,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Juanna {{placed the}} lantern {{beside her and}} opened the book. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>she</b> saw was a name on the fly-leaf, [...] "Jane Beach," [...] and beneath it this inscription, which evidently had been written by some one in a great hurry: [...] "To dearest Leonard from Jane. 23 Jan." ...|$|R
50|$|In her autobiographical essay, Rachael's Story, she {{discussed}} her lifelong {{gender identity}} as female, and one motive of her going to England was a hope {{for an opportunity}} to address her gender issues. In 1977 she went to England to work for PhD in astronomy at an all-male St John's College, Cambridge, and did research at Cavendish Laboratory in University of Cambridge. Among the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> did on arrival in Cambridge was to approach John Randall at Charing Cross Hospital in London, who prescribed oestrogen. In 1978, she came out as transgender, and started with her PhD supervisor, Richard Hills. She said Rachael spontaneously came up as her name one morning.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the opening}} of the Civil War, G. J. Adams told Bethany that [...] "she was at liberty to go {{wherever}} she pleased." [...] Veney then went to Worcester, Massachusetts, and one of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> recalled doing was making gruel and carrying it to the sick Union soldiers in Brookfield. During this time, she also worked as a laundress and earned extra money by going door to door and selling a bluing solution (made to brighten clothing). She apparently had a thriving business in selling this solution to housewives of her neighborhood and “if one of her customers moved to another part of Worcester it was her custom to carry the bluing to them.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Early in March I had a {{telegram}} from her, in consequence of which I repaired immediately to Chelsea, where the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> {{said to me}} was: [...] "He has got it, he has got it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|But Davy's cup of iniquity {{was not yet}} full. He was to {{discover}} that one sin demands another to cover it. They had dinner with Mrs. Lynde that day, and the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> asked Davy was, ...|$|E
60|$|Ellen was {{set down}} by-and-by. Her colour was very deep, {{but she looked}} gentle and happy, and the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> did was to bend over Alfred, kiss him, and say how she wished he had been there.|$|E
6000|$|... "All very natural, Mr. John," [...] {{returned}} the commodore, laughing, and again flourishing {{his hand in}} his own peculiar manner. [...] "The women all love to hear the echoes, for they are not satisfied with what they have once said, but they like to hear it over again. I never knew a lady come on the Otsego, {{but one of the}} <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> did was to get paddled to the Speaking Rocks, to have a chat with herself. They come out in such numbers, sometimes, and then all talk at once, in a way quite to confuse the echo. I suppose you have heard, young lady, the opinion people have now got concerning these voices." ...|$|R
6000|$|Here, then, I stayed by Blanche who, I noted, {{wore the}} ruby heart encircled by serpents. Indeed, {{this was the}} <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> of which <b>she</b> spoke to me, saying, ...|$|R
50|$|One of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> did was {{establish}} a Club for Parents, whose {{purpose was to}} provide a support network for families. They published a newsletter and held support groups twice daily. Once during the day and another at night so that regardless of work schedules, parents could participate. The focus was on information, and sharing of experiences, because even the medical community did not know what caused a lot of the developmental delays or what the learning capacity of the children was. She also established guidelines to allow Down Syndrome students to participate in schooling. Until García's proposal to the Education Council, Downs students and those with IQs under 50, were not allowed to participate in school in Uruguay.|$|R
6000|$|When {{she reached}} the city, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> did was to look about {{and see if there}} was any churchyard, and when she found none, she exclaimed, 'This is a {{delightful}} spot. We will stay here for ever.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{backing off}} that way, she couldn't see {{where she was}} going, and the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> knew she had backed into a bramble bush. It tore her skirts and {{scratched}} her legs. [...] "Ooch!" [...] cried old Granny Fox.|$|E
6000|$|... "May your Leddyship never hae sae weary a heart, that ye canna be {{sensible}} of the weariness of the limbs," [...] said Jeanie. That came better off, {{thought the}} Duke; it's the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> has {{said to the}} purpose.|$|E
60|$|Her resolve once taken, Angela {{followed}} {{him with an}} untroubled face into {{the room where the}} registrar, a gentleman neatly dressed in black, was sitting at a sort of desk. Here the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> her glance fell upon was the person of George Caresfoot. Although it was now the second week in June, he wore a respirator over his mouth and a scarf round his neck, and coughed very much. These were the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> noticed. The next was that he was much thinner, so thin that the cheek-bones stood out from the level of his face, whilst the little blood-shot eyes seemed to protrude, giving to his general appearance, even with the mouth (his worst feature) hidden by the respirator, an unusually repulsive look. He was leaning on the arm of Lady Bellamy, who greeted Angela with a smile which the latter fancied had something of triumph in it.|$|R
25|$|Furious that Titania {{will not}} give him the child, he puts juice from a magical flower into her eyes while she is asleep. The effect of the juice will cause Titania {{to fall in love}} with the <b>first</b> live <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> sees. Titania awakens and finds herself madly in love with Bottom, an actor from the rude {{mechanicals}} whose head was just transformed into that of a donkey, thanks to a curse from Puck.|$|R
6000|$|Juanna {{took the}} journal, and holding {{it to the}} light, opened it at hazard. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>she</b> saw was her own name, for in truth it contained, among many other matters, {{a record of the}} priest's unhappy infatuation from the first moment of their meeting, and also of his pious efforts to {{overcome}} it. Turning the pages rapidly she came to the last on which there was any writing. It ran as follows: ...|$|R
