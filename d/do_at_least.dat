Breuer later clarified his comments on Facebook that did not end speculation on Johnson's future with the band.|$|E

The Appalachian Trail Conservancy claims that the Appalachian Trail is the longest hiking-only trail in the world.

500|$|After {{the release}} of The Avengers in May 2012, Tom Russo of Boston.com noted that aside from the {{occasional}} [...] "novelty" [...] such as Aliens vs. Predator (2004), {{the idea of a}} shared universe was virtually unheard of in Hollywood. Since that time, the shared universe model created by Marvel Studios has begun to be replicated by other film studios that held rights to other comic book characters. In April 2014, Tuna Amobi, a media analyst for Standard & Poor's Equity Research Services, stated that in the previous three to five years, Hollywood studios began planning [...] "megafranchises" [...] for years to come, opposed to working one blockbuster at a time. Amobi added, [...] "A lot of these superhero characters were just being left there to gather dust. Disney has proved that this [...] can be a gold mine." [...] However, with additional studios now [...] "playing the megafranchise game", Doug Creutz, media analyst for Cowen and Company, feels the allure will eventually die for audiences: [...] "If Marvel's going to make two or three films a year, and Warner Brothers is going to <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> a film every year, and Sony's going to do a film every year, and Fox [...] going to do a film every year, can everyone do well in that scenario?

Every member {{is required to}} <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one hour per week of cleaning if they are able, encouraging accountability for {{the community and the}} space. Most decisions within OSCA are made by modified consensus. Oberlin bans all fraternities and sororities, making the co-ops the largest student-organized social system at the college. In addition to OSCA's four housing/dining and three dining-only cooperatives, Brown Bag Co-op is an OSCA-backed grocery that sells personal servings of food at bulk prices. OSCA also funds the Nicaragua Sister Partnership (NICSIS), a [...] "sister cooperative" [...] with Nicaragua's National Union of Farmers and Ranchers (UNAG). NICSIS works as a micro-lending program with a mission to empower female members of the community and provide superior benefits for laborers. Outside of OSCA, other Oberlin co-ops include the Bike Co-op, Pottery Co-op, and SWAP: The Oberlin Book Co-op.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have also}} {{been a number of}} {{problems}} regarding studies of free will. Particularly in earlier studies, research relied too much on the introspection of the participants, but introspective estimates of event timing were found to be inaccurate. Many brain activity measures have been insufficient and primitive as there is no good independent brain-function measure of the conscious generation of intentions, choices, or decisions. The conclusions drawn from measurements that have been made are debatable too, as they don't necessarily tell, for example, what a sudden dip in the readings is representing. In other words, the dip might {{have nothing to do with}} unconscious decision, since many other mental processes are going on while performing the task. Some of the research mentioned here has gotten more advanced, however, even recording individual neurons in conscious volunteers. Researcher Itzhak Fried says that available studies <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> suggest consciousness comes in a later stage of decision making than previously expected – challenging any versions of [...] "free will" [...] where intention occurs at the beginning of the human decision process.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first version}} of the {{screenplay}} was written by first-time screenwriters Gary Goldman and David Z. Weinstein. Goldman had been inspired by {{a new wave of}} martial arts films that had [...] "all sorts of weird actions and special effects, shot against this background of Oriental mysticism and modern sensibilities". They had written a Western originally set in the 1880s with Jack Burton as a cowboy who rides into town. Goldman and Weinstein envisioned combining Chinese fantasy elements with the western. They submitted the script to TAFT Entertainment Pictures executive producers Paul Monash and Keith Barish during the summer of 1982. Monash bought their script and had them <b>do</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one rewrite but still did not like the results. He remembers, [...] "The problems came largely from the fact it was set in turn-of-the-century San Francisco, which affected everythingstyle, dialogue, action". Goldman rejected a request by 20th Century Fox for a re-write that asked for major alterations. He was angered when the studio wanted to update it to a contemporary setting. The studio then removed the writers from the project. However, they still wanted credit for their contributions.|$|E
