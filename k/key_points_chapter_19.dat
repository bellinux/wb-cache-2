5000|$|The {{heading for}} <b>Chapter</b> <b>19</b> {{declares}} that [...] "Nothing is more {{worthy of a}} captain than to foretell {{the policies of the}} enemy." [...] Close {{to the end of the}} Roman civil war between Brutus and Cassius and Marc Antony and Octavian, Brutus won the battle on his wing but Cassius believed that Brutus had actually lost. Thinking the battle to be all but over, Cassius killed himself. Machiavelli relates the <b>point</b> of <b>Chapter</b> <b>19</b> to a moment in modern history; when, in 1498, Florence went to war with Venice and was able to predict the enemy army's movements and win the war.|$|R
5000|$|Chapter 5, [...] "The Frozen River", {{deals with}} the question, [...] "Does time flow?" [...] One <b>key</b> <b>point</b> in this <b>chapter</b> deals with special relativity. Observers moving {{relative}} to each other have different conceptions of what exists at a given moment, and hence they have different conceptions of reality. The conclusion is that time does not flow, as all things simultaneously exist at the same time.|$|R
40|$|Extract:This {{chapter is}} an accompaniment to the {{previous}} chapter (Chapter 4) in which you learnt how to critically appraise evidence {{about the effects of}} interventions. In order to further illustrate the <b>key</b> <b>points</b> from <b>Chapter</b> 4, this chapter contains a number of worked examples of questions about the effects of interventions. As we mentioned in the preface of the book, we believe that it can be easier to learn the process of critical appraisal when you see some worked examples of how it is done, and it is even better when the examples are from your own health profession. Therefore, this chapter (and Chapters 7, 9 and 11) contains examples from a range of health professions. Some of the clinical examples are relevant to more than one health profession...|$|R

The "Rehabilitation Administrative Manual" [RAM] {{from the}} California Department of Rehabilitation [DOR] {{consists}} of multiple volumes. The problem with referencing the RAM is {{total number of}} volumes and quantity of material contained therein, making the ability to find and quote actual chapters and sections containing needed rules, regulations, and policies to cite during daily tasks at the DOR time consuming. Information was obtained through research of related literature, discussions with the author's project advisor, and communication with Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors [VRCs]. It was determined that summarizing <b>key</b> <b>points</b> within selected <b>chapters</b> of the RAM would decrease {{the amount of time}} the VRCs needed to reference and cite specific rules, regulations, and policies while completing their daily assignments.

40|$|The <b>key</b> <b>points</b> in this <b>chapter</b> are: 1. Purely {{statistical}} {{market analysis}} techniques for determining risk are incomplete because, {{in the real}} world, risk is effected by non-statistical phenomena such as news. Quantitative models can ignore such "shocks," but analysts still need to explain their models {{in the face of}} such shocks. 2. Risk must include the effects of all relationships. This is only partially accounted by models using correlation statistics. 3. Market analysis techniques used for risk management have much in common with the techniques used in market surveillance for regulation. In this paper, we provide a framework that can be applied either to risk management for trading or to the regulation of markets. Our framework lets analysts define patterns of market behavior and detect new or hidden relationships between subjects in order to evaluate risk and discover information flows. Introduction From the information technology perspective, Wall Street represents a complex and [...] ...|$|R

In addition, I propose that <b>Chapter</b> <b>19</b> is not {{in accordance with the}} principal of {{the best interests of the}} child. I examine the history of surrogate motherhood in South Africa and establish that, prior to the enactment of <b>Chapter</b> <b>19,</b> no legislation expressly afforded surrogate motherhood agreements legal recognition. Hence, prior to the enactment of <b>Chapter</b> <b>19,</b> parties who entered surrogacy agreements could, first, not rely on the agreement to enforce contractual obligations, and secondly, the legal positions of the parties to the agreement were uncertain. Thirdly, a child born of a surrogacy agreement was seen as the child of the surrogate mother and not of the commissioning parents. South Afric...|$|R

40|$|<b>Chapter</b> <b>19</b> of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) {{replaced}} court {{review of}} U. S. antidumping and countervailing duties with binding review by special binational panels of trade experts. It requires these panels {{to apply the}} same standard of review that U. S. courts use in trade remedy cases. Despite the centrality of this requirement to the <b>Chapter</b> <b>19</b> panel system, these panels have not adhered to this mandate. <b>Chapter</b> <b>19</b> panels overturn U. S. agency rulings much more often than the courts. In fact, they apply two different standards of review: exacting scrutiny where foreign producers and governments appeal, and near-absolute deference to agencies when U. S. industries appeal. In contrast, panels have shown great deference to Canadian agency determinations (which almost invariably find dumping exists) and favor Canadian industries seeking duties as often as foreign producers seeking their reduction or elimination. Previously suggested explanations - that <b>Chapter</b> <b>19</b> appeals involve different facts, that U. S. courts are inept, or that U. S. industries have captured U. S. agencies - fail to explain these phenomena. Rather, these discrepancies result from conflicting views about trade laws within the U. S. government, the relatively greater incentive of the Canadian government to control the <b>Chapter</b> <b>19</b> process through panel appointments and political action, and a procedural structure that {{makes it easy for}} panelists to override the U.
