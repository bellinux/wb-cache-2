He also argues that the one reading on which Uthman united the Muslims was the one in circulation among most Muslims, and that it reached them through uninterrupted transmission from Muhammad.|$|E

Since 2005, he won ten times at Roland Garros, ten times at Monte Carlo, ten times at Barcelona and seven at Rome. However, Nadal has shed that label owing to his success on other surfaces, including holding simultaneous Grand Slam tournament titles on grass, hard courts, and clay on two separate occasions, winning eight Masters series titles on hardcourt, and winning the Olympic gold medal on hardcourt.|$|E

25|$|Constant {{court cases}} against Him: Swamiji {{had to face}} many court cases filed against him.

25|$|Makkali Gosala {{seems to}} have {{combined}} the ideas of older schools of thought into an eclectic doctrine. He appears to have believed in niyati (destiny), svabhava (nature), and sangati (change), and possibly parinama, which may have prompted other philosophical schools to label him variously as ahetuvadin, vainayikavadin, ajnanavadin, and issarakaranavadin. According to him all beings undergo development (parinama). This culminates {{in the course of}} time (samsarasuddhi) in final salvation to which all beings are destined under the impact of the factors of niyati (destiny), bhava (nature), and sangati (change). As such destiny does not appear as the only player, but rather chance or indeterminism plays equal part in his doctrine. He thus subscribed to niyativada (fatalism) only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought that some future events like salvation for all were strictly determined.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1960s and 1970s, three left arm spinners {{dominated}} the Indian domestic cricket scene. Along with Doshi there were, Padmakar Shivalkar from Bombay, & Rajinder Goel of Haryana & Delhi. Goel still holds {{the record for}} the highest number of wickets in the Ranji Trophy (640 at 17.14). Shivlakar holds the record for his team Mumbai. Years after years, they destroyed strong batting line ups in Indian cricket with the guile of their spin, only to be overlooked by the national selectors. The only reason was the presence of B.S. Bedi. With a world class left arm spinner readily available, the selectors were reluctant to give the others much chance. Thus, Shivalker and Goel had to content themselves with a few unofficial test matches against Sri Lanka. Goel was specially unlucky, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was originally selected to make his official Test Debut against WI at Delhi, in 1974–78. But a last minute change saw off spinner Venkat replacing him. Doshi, in that sense, can be considered to be the luckiest; at least he got the chance to represent India in full internationals. Nevertheless, he too lost the best years of his playing career waiting for his chance to come.|$|E

500|$|The title Christ, or Messiah, {{indicates}} that Jesus' followers believed {{him to be}} the anointed heir of King David, whom some Jews expected to save Israel. The Gospels refer to him not only as a Messiah but in the absolute form as [...] "the Messiah" [...] or, equivalently, [...] "the Christ". In early Judaism, this absolute form of the title is not found, but only phrases such as [...] "his Messiah". The tradition is ambiguous enough to leave room for debate as to whether Jesus defined his eschatological role as that of the Messiah. The Jewish messianic tradition included many different forms, some of them focused on a Messiah figure and others not. Based on the Christian tradition, Gerd Theissen advances the hypothesis that Jesus saw himself in messianic terms but did not claim the title [...] "Messiah". Bart Ehrman argues that Jesus did consider himself to be the Messiah, albeit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be the king of the new political order that God would usher in, not in the sense that most people today think of the term.|$|E
