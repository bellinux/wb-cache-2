Sections of the Great Wall had been built prior to the Qin Dynasty (221–207BC) and subsequently connected and fortified during the Qin dynasty, although its present form was mostly an engineering feat and remodeling of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644AD) during the 15th and 16th centuries. The large walls of Pingyao serve as one example. Likewise, {{the walls of the}} Forbidden City in Beijing were established in the early 15th century by the Yongle Emperor.|$|E

According to CMX, these changes were made in conjunction with Shueisha and Tenjho Tenge creator Oh! great, who examines each of their changes.

The controller {{has not been}} released outside Japan, but online retailers such as Amazon.com and Play-Asia do import and sell the controller internationally. It differs from previous editions in that it features a white cable which is 3 m (9.8 ft) long, rather than the 2 m (6.5 ft) black cable used on standard controllers. In 2014, the manufacturing production of the white controller was resumed under the Super Smash Bros. branding, again exclusively <b>for</b> Japan (see <b>more</b> <b>info</b> on the Super Smash Bros. edition below).|$|R
5000|$|Mackintosh {{park was}} the {{terminus}} of the 7A Dublin Bus route, {{but the first}} few departures in the morning terminated at Pearse Villas. The route originally ran every 3 minutes with more running on Saturdays and Sundays. Up to 112 departures of the 7A ran every day with 125 on some days. The bus used to be as popular as the 46A. A few years ago Dublin Bus scrapped the route. But, on November 13, 2016 Dublin Bus reintroduced the 7A. The new route leaves from Loughlinstown Wood Estate and has the exact same route of the old 7. On November 13, the 7 was moved out of Sallynoggin onto the Sallyglen Road and moved onto the Blackrock bypass. It also leaves Brides Glen, avoiding the old terminus in Loughlinstown. Dublin Bus also redesigned the 111 to go every hour from Brides Glen via Loughlinstown Hospital, Loughlinstown Wood Estate, Watsons, Sallynoggin, Mountown Road, Dún Laoghaire. The bus continues through to Glasthule and terminates at the old 8 terminus in Dalkey. <b>For</b> <b>more</b> route <b>info</b> check out www.dublinbus.ie ...|$|R

2500|$|Bernoulli's {{principle}} {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the lift force on an airfoil, if the behaviour of the fluid flow {{in the vicinity of the}} foil is known. [...] For example, if the air flowing past the top surface of an aircraft wing is moving faster than the air flowing past the bottom surface, then Bernoulli's principle implies that the pressure on the surfaces of the wing will be lower above than below. This pressure difference results in an upwards lifting force. Whenever the distribution of speed past the top and bottom surfaces of a wing is known, the lift forces can be calculated (to a good approximation) using Bernoulli's equations – established by Bernoulli over a century before the first man-made wings were used for the purpose of flight. Bernoulli's principle does not explain why the air flows faster past the top of the wing and slower past the underside. See the article on aerodynamic lift <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>info.</b>|$|E
2500|$|For {{the general}} field of human speech reproduction, a {{bandwidth}} of 5512Hz {{is sufficient to}} produce excellent results (for voice) using the sampling rate of 11025 and VBR encoding from 44100 (standard) wave files.. This is easily accomplished using LAME version 3.99.5 and the command line [...] "lame -V 9.6 lecture.WAV" [...] English speakers average 41–42kbit/s with -V 9.6 setting but this may vary with amount of silence recorded or the rate of delivery (wpm). Resampling to 12000 (6K bandwidth) is selected by the LAME parameter -V 9.4 Likewise -V 9.2 selects 16000 sample rate and a resultant 8K lowpass filtering. <b>For</b> <b>more</b> <b>info</b> see Nyquist – Shannon. [...] Older versions of LAME and FFmpeg only support integer arguments for variable bit rate quality selection parameter. [...] The n.nnn quality parameter (-V) is documented at lame.sourceforge.net but is only supported in LAME with the new style VBR variable bit rate quality selector—not average bit rate (ABR).|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} said that the first Macaulay of Lewis on record is Dòmhnall Cam, in 1610. However, there appear to be two Macaulays {{recorded}} as witnessing a 1572 record of sasine, following a grant of land to Torcail Conanach Macleod. The document, unknown to Matheson, records the names of [...] "Johanno roy [...] mcLachlayne McOler", and [...] "Murdo mcRorie mcLachlayne". According to Aonghas MacCoinnich, the name McOler would appear to be Macaulay, likely meaning that these were Uig Macaulays. The Lewis traditions, gathered by Thomas in the 19th century, had an Iain Ruadh, as grandfather to the Macaulay hero Dòmhnall Cam (see sections below). However, Dòmhnall Cam is on record in 1610 ("Donald Cam McCoull and Mulcallum McCoull"), and Thomas's traditional genealogy implausibly puts his grandfather in the 1450s. MacCoinnich noted that the traditions noted by Thomas seemed to link the Macaulays of Lewis to Wester Ross and Loch Broom; and although any real connection may have been forgotten by tradition, the Macleod trans-Minch lordship would have made such connection quite possible.
