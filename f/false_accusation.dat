5|$|Folkvord {{is the son}} {{of school}} {{principal}} Sverre Folkvord and housewife Eldrid Kjesbu. He finished secondary school earning the examen artium degree in Trondheim and then started studies to become a social worker at the Social School of Trondheim. By 1976 he was the leader of the national Social Agencies Union serving until 1978. In 1982, along with fellow Red Electoral Alliance member Harald Stabell, Folkvord sued Oslo's social-office leading figures, Signe M. Stray Ryssdal and Marit Moe. They accused them of misconduct and of making a <b>false</b> <b>accusation</b> which led to an innocent man going to prison. These accusations eventually led to a police investigation into the matter. After finding no proof of their accusations, Moe sued Folkvord and Stabell for defamatatory charges made against her, but she abstained from pursuing this in court.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes criminals {{were beaten}} with the bastinado to gain confessions, but Han {{scholars}} argued that torture {{was not the}} best means of gaining confession, while court conferences were called into session to decide how many strokes should be given and what size the stick should be {{so as not to}} cause permanent injury. Imprisonment was an unheard of form of punishment during Han; common punishments were the death penalty by beheading, periods of forced hard labor for convicts, exile, or monetary fines. Mutilating punishments also existed in early Han, borrowed from previous practice in Qin. This included tattooing the face, cutting off the nose, castration, and amputation of one or both feet, yet by 167 BCE these were abolished in favor of lengthy floggings with the bastinado. Further reforms were implemented by the first year of Emperor Jing's (r. 154141 BCE) reign which decreased the amount of strokes a prisoner could receive from the bastinado. Starting in 195 BCE, those aged seventy and older were exempt from mutilating punishments. Further reforms exempted those aged seventy and older from harsh interrogation methods in cases other than <b>false</b> <b>accusation</b> and murder.|$|E
5|$|In {{the year}} Grann 757, barbarians from {{the kingdom of}} Issach siege Darna Castle, and Prince Kurth of Grannvale and his friend Lord Byron of Chalpy {{set out on a}} punitive expedition. When the southwestern kingdom of Verdane takes {{advantage}} of Grannvale's weakened state to invade, Byron's son Sigurd repels them and launches a counter-invasion. During the campaign, Sigurd meets a mysterious girl named Deirdre. She is revealed to be of Naga blood, a long-lost member of the Grannvalian royal family, and the descendant of the crusader with the power to defeat the evil dragon Loptyr. Sigurd and Deirdre fall in love and marry, and their son Seliph is born in Agustria. At this point, an alliance of Grannvale dukes stage an attempt to seize the throne, murder Kurth, and frame Sigurd and his father for the crime. Sigurd is forced into exile, while the archbishop Manfroy of the Loptyr Sect kidnaps Deirdre and erases her memories in order to use her to resurrect Loptyr. His plan is to wed her to Lord Arvis of Velthomer - the two are, unbeknownst to them, half siblings, and their union will produce a human vessel capable of hosting the consciousness of Loptyr. During their exile, Sigurd and his allies are forced to hide Seliph and the rest of their children from the forces of Arvis and the Loptyr cult. After a year in exile, Sigurd begins making his way back through Jugdral, killing the Dukes responsible for the <b>false</b> <b>accusation.</b> Apparently exonerated, Sigurd returns to Grannvale, only to learn that Arvis has married Deirdre to become Grannvale's king. Arvis orders Sigurd's allies to be executed and personally murders Sigurd.|$|E
50|$|Tong is {{the author}} of three books and {{numerous}} publications on the topic of false abuse allegations. In 1992, Tong published his first book, Don't Blame ME, Daddy: <b>False</b> <b>Accusations</b> of Child Sexual Abuse. It was written after his legal battles to prove his innocence of accusations against him. The book detailed the increase of <b>false</b> <b>accusations</b> of child sexual abuse in relation to divorce and child custody cases. He followed up with the book Ashes to Ashes, Families to Dust in 1996. The book provided information for those falsely accused of abuse. In 2002, Tong published his third book, Elusive Innocence: Survival Guide for the Falsely Accused. The book, which targeted attorneys, detailed the difference between actual abuse and <b>false</b> <b>accusations</b> of abuse as well as domestic violence allegations. It included chapters on fighting <b>false</b> <b>accusations</b> and a summary of case studies involving <b>false</b> <b>accusations.</b> Tong also penned the Foreword to the 2009 book I'm Going to be a Dad, Now What? written by Craig Baird.|$|R

A bomb exploded as police were dispersing a peaceful rally, killing seven policemen and wounding many others. The anarchists were blamed, and their spectacular trial gained national attention. The Knights of Labor were seriously injured by the <b>false</b> <b>accusation</b> that the Knights promoted anarchistic violence. Many Knights locals transferred to the less radical and more respectable AFL unions or railroad brotherhoods.|$|E
25|$|The {{leader of}} Tangwai, Huang Shin-chieh, and his comrades soon petitioned the KMT {{government}} {{for the restoration of}} elections, but were rebuffed. On 21 January 1979, the KMT arrested Yu Deng-fa, one of the most prestigious Tangwai leaders, and his son with the intentional <b>false</b> <b>accusation</b> of propagandising for the Chinese Communist Party. Tangwai regarded the arrest of Yu as a signal of complete suppression and decided to make a last-ditch effort by holding radical demonstrations on the street, resulting in the escalating conflict between the conservative KMT and Tangwai.|$|E

25|$|Sívori {{retired from}} the playing field in 1969. Although he retired to his native Argentina as a wealthy man, his love for the game meant {{that he decided to}} take up a further career as a coach; he coached River Plate, Rosario Central, Estudiantes de La Plata, Racing Club and Vélez Sarsfield. In 1970, Bobby Moore was arrested in Bogota, Colombia after a shop {{assistant}} claimed to have seen him steal a bracelet from the shop she was working in. After several days, the charges were quashed, and as Moore took a flight to Mexico, he met Sivori, who told him that the <b>false</b> <b>accusation</b> thing was frequent in Colombia.|$|E
25|$|With {{the end of}} World War II in 1945, the {{surviving}} Jews began {{to return to their}} homes although many chose to emigrate to the United States, Great Britain, and British-controlled Palestine. In many ways, the antisemitism of the Nazi regime was continued in different guises. Claims of blood libel and persecution of Jews continued, in part due to fear that the returning Jews would attempt to reclaim property stolen during the Holocaust or expose the true nature of the assistance given by the local population in the previously Nazi-occupied territories. One culminating example was the Kielce pogrom, which occurred in 1946 in Poland when citizens violently attacked Jews based on a <b>false</b> <b>accusation</b> of the kidnapping of a Christian child.|$|E
25|$|Colon's {{self-confidence}} is remarkable. He had {{a strong}} regard for right and justice. Firmly, though respectfully, he reproved Rabbi Israel Bruna, the foremost German talmudist of his time, for overstepping the bounds of his authority. Responsum No. 4, addressed to the congregation of Regensburg, is highly important. A number of Jews of that community having been falsely accused, and a sum of money having to be raised for their ransom, the surrounding places and neighboring communities refused to contribute, at least insofar {{as it was a}} question of paying a fixed tax instead of making voluntary contributions. Colon decided that the communities in question could not refuse to pay their share, since the same <b>false</b> <b>accusation</b> might be made against them also, and if the accused in this case were proved innocent and ransomed, they would then be safe from danger.|$|E

25|$|Under Ottoman rule, Christians and Jews were {{considered}} dhimmis and {{were allowed to}} practice their religious precepts. During the Damascus affair of 1840 the <b>false</b> <b>accusation</b> of ritual murder was brought against members of the Jewish community of Damascus. In addition the massacre of Christians in 1860 {{was also one of}} the most notorious incidents of these centuries, when fighting between Druze and Maronites in Mount Lebanon spilled over into the city. Several thousand Christians were killed, with many more being saved through the intervention of the Algerian exile Abd al-Qadir and his soldiers (three days after the massacre started), who brought them to safety in Abd al-Qadir's residence and the citadel. The Christian quarter of the old city (mostly inhabited by Catholics), including a number of churches, was burnt down. The Christian inhabitants of the notoriously poor and refractory Midan district outside the walls (mostly Orthodox) were, however, protected by their Muslim neighbours.|$|E
25|$|A {{partnership}} reneges {{on their}} contract if they violate {{the rules of}} play; most often this happens when a player plays off-suit when they could have, and therefore should have, followed suit. The penalty for reneging varies; in most cases it nullifies that team's contract (the team cannot make their contract and their score is reduced by 10 points for each bid trick), while sometimes reneging results in a three-trick penalty, meaning the team may still make contract but must take three additional tricks to do so. It does not matter if the player reneges on purpose. The bags still count against the opposing team, and will go against their points. On the other-hand if a team calls reneg and that team cannot prove or call out the first hand that was a potential reneg, then the team that called out the <b>false</b> <b>accusation</b> is penalized the three-trick penalty. The tricks do not count towards opponents bid.|$|E
25|$|In the {{criminal}} code, the ruling principle was the lex talionis. Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, limb for limb was {{the penalty for}} assault upon an amelu. A sort of symbolic retaliation was the punishment for the offender, seen in cutting off the hand that struck a father or stole a trust; in cutting off the breast of a wet nurse who switched the child entrusted to her for another; {{in the loss of}} the tongue that denied father or mother (in Elamite contracts, the same penalty was inflicted for perjury); in the loss of the eye that pried into forbidden secrets. The loss of the surgeon's hand that caused loss of life or limb, or the brander's hand that obliterated a slave's identification mark, are very similar. The slave who struck a freeman or denied his master lost an ear, the organ of hearing and symbol of obedience. A person who brought another into danger of death by <b>false</b> <b>accusation</b> was punished by death. A perjurer was punished by the same penalty the perjurer sought to bring upon another.|$|E

25|$|After {{the death}} of her husband, Onassis {{returned}} permanently to the United States, splitting her time between Manhattan, Martha's Vineyard, and the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis, Massachusetts. In 1975, she became a consulting editor at Viking Press, a position that she held for two years. After almost a decade of avoiding participation in political events, she attended the 1976 Democratic National Convention and stunned the assembled delegates when she appeared in the visitors' gallery. She resigned from Viking Press in 1977 following the <b>false</b> <b>accusation</b> by The New York Times that she held some responsibility for the company's publication of Jeffrey Archer novel Shall We Tell the President?, which was set in a fictional future presidency of Ted Kennedy and described an assassination plot against him. Two years later, she appeared alongside her mother-in-law Rose Kennedy at Faneuil Hall in Boston when Ted Kennedy announced {{that he was going to}} challenge incumbent President Jimmy Carter for the Democratic nomination for president.

25|$|While {{he was in}} Erzurum, Pietschmann was {{witness to}} the Armenian Genocide {{carried out by the}} local {{government}} authorities. When the Germans and Austrians withdrew their forces from the front, Pietschmann was forced to leave Erzurum on 18 June 1915 by the German consul of Erzurum, Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter. Pietschmann was accompanied by Carl Schlimme, an assistant of Scheubner-Richter. They were told by the consul to take an Armenian family along and help them find refuge. In Bayburt, they were stopped by Turkish soldiers and ordered to surrender the Armenian family. When they refused, the caravan drivers were apprehended. Consequently, Pietschmann and Schlimme were forced to drive the caravans themselves. When Turkish soldiers demanded the Armenian family once more, Pietschmann and Schlimme confronted them with guns and thus secured a passage for themselves out of Bayburt, headed towards Erzincan. Upon arrival in Erzincan, the Armenian family was apprehended and stationed in a local prison under the pretext of concealing weapons in their belongings. According to Schlimme, this was a <b>false</b> <b>accusation</b> since he had searched their belongings for any sort of weapon himself.|$|E
25|$|Tyrone Dobbs {{was also}} the centre of a {{domestic}} abuse storyline when he was introduced to police officer Kirsty Soames whilst on a night out. Tyrone and Kirsty immediately hit it off. Kirsty's temper began to show when she used to become jealous of Tyrone's friends, specifically his friendship with Fiz Stape. Kirsty fell pregnant and her temper soon turned violent as she lashed out at Tyrone on numerous occasions, attacking him with her fists and kitchen appliances. Tyrone hid his injuries from his concerned friends and refused to leave the house. Kirsty gave birth in the Rovers Return after a heated confrontation with Tina, yet Tyrone was absent due to him fixing Fiz's boiler. This made Kirsty secretly leave out Tyrone's name as their newborn daughter Ruby's father on the birth certificate. Kirsty's violent outbursts become more frequent and a terrified Tyrone finally confides in a horrified Fiz about Kirsty's domestic abuse, this leads to Tyrone and Fiz embarking on a secret affair after she confesses her love for him. Fiz and Tyrone conspire a plan together for Tyrone to wed Kirsty then report Kirsty to the police for her domestic abuse, resulting in Kirsty being sent to prison and Tyrone getting full custody of his daughter Ruby. Tyrone proposes to a delighted Kirsty, but Kirsty eventually discovers his affair with Fiz, and their plan. Kirsty eventually reveals Fiz and Tyrone's affair {{in front of everybody}} at her and Tyrone's wedding. After the wedding, Kirsty and Tyrone have a blazing row back at their house, resulting in Kirsty falling down the stairs after trying to attack Tyrone. The row is overheard by several neighbours and they think Tyrone has been assaulting Kirsty and call the police. Kirsty lies to the police and makes a <b>false</b> <b>accusation</b> that Tyrone has been beating her for months. This leads to Tyrone's arrest and he is bailed until his appending trial. Whilst on bail, Tyrone flees Weatherfield with Fiz, her daughter Hope and his daughter Ruby causing the police to issue a warrant for his arrest. Tyrone is caught and arrested. Kirsty lies again whilst giving evidence at Tyrone's trial by playing the victim to the jury. But whilst struggling being a single mum at home, Kirsty snaps at a screaming Ruby and starts screaming at her child to stop crying. Realising that she does not trust herself around her daughter, Kirsty interrupts Tyrone's trial and confesses to the judge that it was her who had been assaulting Tyrone and he was innocent. Tyrone gets released and Kirsty gets charged and is sentenced to three years in prison. Tyrone gets full custody of Ruby and starts his new life with his girlfriend Fiz.|$|E
