40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{philosophical}} foundations of rational-choice theory. It is argued that L. Savage's expected-utility axioms cannot be defended as requirements of instrumental rationality, {{in part because of}} their implications for the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences.</b> Then it is argued that common knowledge of rationality does not imply that rational game-players must be in Nash equilibrium, and for some games is an incoherent concept. Finally, the suggestion that rational-choice theory is self-defeating is examined in relation to coordination games (where the theory cannot explain the role of salience) and the concept of "resolute" choice.

40|$|Changes of the climatic {{conditions}} will affect urban drainage systems, {{as they are}} closely related to the weather phenomenon and are built as to cope with the weather occurring. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate indicators that can be used to describe and compare impacts and adaptation measures in existing urban drainage systems. Problems in the system due to climate change can be summarised as problems with flooding of surfaces and basements, increased amount of combined sewer overflows (CSO), increase of the inflow to waste water treatment plants (WWTP) and increase in pollutants spreading from urban areas to the environment. The impacts needs to be described with indicators taking into account the system behaviour both before, during and after an event (e. g. urban flooding) has occurred, and can be divided into (A) description of the system performance, (B) capacity exceeding in the system, and (C) <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> as a result of capacity exceeding. The consequences can be divided into sustainable aspects as: technical, economical, socio-cultural, environmental, and health. The research is performed within a project which will also include model simulations of urban drainage systems in four Swedish municipalities as to assess impacts and evaluate the use of indicators.

40|$|Purpose – The {{question}} is addressed of how types of consequences of accounting {{can be identified}} and classified. In doing so, an analysis is conducted of consequences for Kain Nikunau (i. e. indigenous persons of Nikunau Island) that have some association with the accounting brought from the Atlantic to the Pacific by I-Matang (i. e. indigenous persons of Europe, in particular being fair-skinned). Design/methodology/approach – We adopt an eclectic approach; use historical sources and participant-observation data; compose an analytical <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> of accounting {{for the last several}} generations of Kain Nikunau; and discuss the findings in order to enhance the present literature about consequences of accounting. Findings – Human application of I-Matang accounting ideas and practices, figuring even mundanely and unobtrusively in various activities and situations (e. g. trade, mining and wage employment, Christian missions and churches, formal education, medical care and other public services, development planning and bi-lateral aid, and colonial and island government), have caused or formed conditions of possibility for wide-ranging and far-reaching changes on Nikunau and to Kain Nikunau. These changes are consequences of accounting and may be classified as biological, cultural, demographic, distributional, environmental, geographic, macro- and micro-economic, organisational, political, religious, social and societal. The desirability and undesirability of these consequences are ambiguous. Identifying and classifying these consequences is an analytical inductive process requiring taking several perspectives, applying lateral thinking and examining a field of inquiry longitudinally.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} psychological consequences of serious brain damage. It {{is divided into}} two key parts, the first (theoretical) part and the second (empirical) part. The role and division of the central nervous system and the roles of each constituent part are described in the theoretical part. Then the detailed description of the brain damage, its various levels and their characteristics is followed. Furthermore, the causes and various methods of diagnosing the brain damage are described. Then we move to the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> caused by the brain damage. The general consequences and division of the most common consequences depended on damaged lobes of the cerebral cortex are also presented. The description of the general psychological characteristics of an individual is followed. The division of mental processes and the thorough description of each group and the concept of personality are defined as well. The course of rehabilitation after the brain damage with possible results is described in the last constituent part of the theoretical part. The empirical part of the dissertation includes a study of a case. A difficult experience of a young man on the brink of adulthood, who had a traffic accident as a pedestrian, is presented here. Unfortunate event, its circumstances and the whole course of rehabilitation with the comparison of the conditions before and after the damage (focused on psychological characteristics of an individual) are described here in details. Last but not least, the changes of the psychological characteristics of an individual and their influence on the quality of life are presented as well. ...|$|E
40|$|This Thesis {{deals with}} the option of {{employing}} the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic (ACR) when a radiation emergency is imminent. Primarily, it focuses on evaluation of selected devices designed for radiation reconnaissance; summarising of radiation protection related legislation; and study of approved procedures. At its beginning, this Thesis tracks the origin of early detection systems at {{the territory of the}} then Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and their gradual evolution into the the existing form. From the radiation emergency point of view, this nationwide system represents a priceless help for monitoring of radioactive contamination dispersion and for warning. The following part sums up basic information on what is an ionizing radiation, how it comes into being and which basic quantities describe it. This part also contains basic type distinction, <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>consequences</b> for human organism and the most significant interactions of sources of ionizing radiation that could be misused with the most probability. This specific topic is introduced here because of the subsequent part of this Thesis being named Radiological Dispersion Device, or the dirty bomb. The significant part of this Thesis is the summary and classification of related legislation. The first documents referred to are two international standards. Publication 103 the 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection is dealing, inter alia, with dosing limits determining dose levels in planned exposure situations and reference levels used for emergency exposure situations and existing exposure situations. Publication 96 Protecting People against Radiation Exposure in the Event of a Radiological Attack is more substantial for this Thesis since it partly copes with the protection of front-line units including Integrated Rescue System (IRS) components and it specifies maximum exposure time for intervening personnel. Based on the IRS Catalogue of Typical Activities (STC 01 /IZS), Materialised and Verified Use of a Radiological Weapon, the ACR {{would be one of the}} intervening components in such an attack. This Thesis analyses in detail individual ACR procedures starting with activities before employment, through threat prevention, event reaction to post-event activities like decontamination followed by monitoring of personnel contamination and their health condition. The practical part deals mainly with one of the Thesis´s goals which was evaluation of selected dosimetric devices used by the military for radiation reconnaissance. For this purpose, the quantitative research processing their main parameters was applied. The analysis within a selected sample was used for comparing and the sumary index IVi then showed the status of device applicability for contemporary use in radiation emergency. The pre-defined goals of this Thesis have been met implementing the above methods. The comparison of individual devices and their evaluation in respect to their applicability in joint radiation emergency operation with other IRS components has been carried out via discussion. It has been found out that some of the devices are obsolete and do not comply with the requirements for this job. This fact reflects the reality that these devices were designed in the period of a potential nuclear war. This corresponds with their robust structure and high level of sensitivity which is not desirable for a radiation emergency. The most severe problem, however, seems to be the fact that some devices measure quantities in old, no more used, units which could cause misinterpretation. On the other hand, other devices are modern, sensitive at low levels of dose input and offer real-time information on a well organised LCD display. To answer the question of ACR´s readiness to intervene in a radiation emergency one has to say that the ACR is ready to meet its rescue and consequence management tasks at a satisfactory level...|$|E
