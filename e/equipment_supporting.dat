2500|$|The [...] "C-74 squadron" [...] (later 521st Air Transport Group, 1701st Air Transport Wing), Air Transport Command {{operated}} two squadrons of C-74 Globemasters from Brookley from 1947 {{until their}} retirement in 1955. [...] The eleven aircraft were used extensively for worldwide transport of personnel and <b>equipment,</b> <b>supporting</b> United States military missions. [...] They saw extensive service supporting the Berlin Airlift and the Korean War being used on scheduled MATS overseas routes though the late 1940s and mid-1950s. [...] Additionally, logistic support flights for Strategic Air Command (SAC), and Tactical Air Command (TAC) saw the Globemaster in North Africa, the Middle East, Europe, the Caribbean, {{and within the}} United States. Two C-74s were used to support the first TAC Republic F-84 Thunderjet flight across the Pacific Ocean to Japan. SAC also continued to use the Globemasters to rotate Boeing B-47 Stratojet Medium Bombardment Groups on temporary duty in England and Morocco {{as part of their}} REFLEX operation. [...] The C-74s were retired in 1955 due to lack of logistical support. The 1701st ATW flew strategic airlift missions on a worldwide scale with its C-124 Globemaster II fleet after the retirement of the C-74 until 1957 when Military Air Transport Service moved out of Brookley AFB and the base came under the full jurisdiction of Air Material Command.|$|E
