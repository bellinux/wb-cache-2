40|$|The order <b>fill</b> <b>rate</b> is less {{commonly}} used than the volume <b>fill</b> <b>rate</b> (most often just denoted <b>fill</b> <b>rate)</b> as a performance measure for inventory control systems. However, in settings where {{the focus is}} on filling customer orders rather than total quantities, the order <b>fill</b> <b>rate</b> should be the preferred measure. In this paper we consider a continuous review, base-stock policy, where all replenishment orders have the same constant lead time and all unfilled demands are backordered. We develop exact mathematical expressions for the two fill-rate measures when demand follows a compound renewal process. We also elaborate on when the order <b>fill</b> <b>rate</b> can be interpreted as the (extended) ready rate. Furthermore, for the case when customer orders are generated by a negative binomial distribution, we show that it is the size of the shape parameter of this distribution that determines the relative magnitude of the two <b>fill</b> <b>rates.</b> In particular, we show that when customer orders are generated by a geometric distribution, the order <b>fill</b> <b>rate</b> and the volume <b>fill</b> <b>rate</b> are equal (though not equivalent when considering sample paths). For the case when customer inter-arrival times follow an Erlang distribution, we show how to compute the two <b>fill</b> <b>rates.</b> Backordering; continuous review; compound renewal process; inventory control; negative binomial distribution; service levels...|$|R

The performance metrics of interest are the <b>fill</b> <b>rates</b> {{of the high}} priority demand classes (the gold <b>fill</b> <b>rate</b> in the two demand class system and the platinum and gold <b>fill</b> <b>rates</b> in the three-demand class system). Our main interest is in the sensitivity of these <b>fill</b> <b>rates</b> to {{the form of the}} replenishment lead time probability distribution and the resulting quality of approximation methods used to estimate these <b>fill</b> <b>rates.</b> We consider three approximation methods: what we call the single cycle approach attributed to Dekker et al and Deshpande et al, the embedded Markov chain approach of Fadigloglu and Bulut, and the continuous time Markov chain approach of Vicil and Jackson. We confirm the superiority of the embedded Markov chain approach for the case of constant lead times but we find that the <b>fill</b> <b>rates</b> are relatively insensitive to the form of the lead time distribution and both latter approaches, the embedded Markov chain approach and the continuous time Markov chain approach, perform well over wide ranges of lead time variability. For the three-demand class system, we demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} achieve highly differentiated <b>fill</b> <b>rates</b> by demand class and show that these <b>fill</b> <b>rates</b> can be estimated with high accuracy using the continuous time Markov chain approach, provided the <b>fill</b> <b>rate</b> of the lowest priority demand class (the silver <b>fill</b> <b>rate)</b> is not too low...|$|R

50|$|Pores {{that are}} not {{of the same size}} will fill at {{different}} values of pressure, with the smaller ones filling first. This difference in <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> can be a beneficial application of capillary condensation. Many materials have different pore sizes with ceramics being one of the most commonly encountered. In materials with different pore sizes, curves can be constructed similar to Figure 7. A detailed analysis of the shape of these isotherms is done using the Kelvin equation. This enables the pore size distribution to be determined. While this is a relatively simple method of analyzing the isotherms, a more in depth analysis of the isotherms is done using the BET method. Another method of determining the pore size distribution is by using a procedure known as Mercury Injection Porosimetry. This uses the volume of mercury taken up by the solid as the pressure increases to create the same isotherms mentioned above. An application where pore size is beneficial is in regards to oil recovery. When recovering oil from tiny pores, it is useful to inject gas and water into the pore. The gas will then occupy the space where the oil once was, mobilizing the oil, and then the water will displace some of the oil forcing it to leave the pore.|$|E

Left ventriculography was performed at baseline (after pretreatment with propranolol to minimize reflex changes) and was repeated after the intravenous administration of 2. 5 mg nicardipine. Regional peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> and time to peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> were determined in eight ventricular segments before and after nicardipine. At baseline, the time from the R wave to the regional peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> was 380 - 680 msec, {{and there were a}} large number of segments with depressed peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> (p less than 0. 001, vs. distribution of regional peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> in normal subjects using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), indicating both asynchrony of filling (p less than 0. 001, vs. distribution of time to peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> in normal subjects) and nonhomogeneity of diastolic distensibility. Nicardipine administration significantly reduced the distribution of the time to peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> (p less than 0. 001) and increased regional peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> (p less than 0. 001) in a large subset of segments.

40|$|AbstractThe noninvasive {{measurement}} of left ventricular filling has relied predominantly on radionuclide-derived peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> normalized to end-diastolic volume. Doppler echocardiography {{also has the}} ability to measure peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate,</b> but wide application of this technique has been limited by technical errors involved in quantitative echocardiographic determination of mitral anulus cross-sectional area and ventricular volumes. For Doppler echocardiography, normalization of peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> to mitral stroke volume rather than end-diastolic volume permits the derivation of a diastolic filling index that is relatively free of errors caused by geometric assumptions, diameter measurements and sample volume positioning. This normalization process can be achieved by simply dividing early peak filling velocity by the time velocity integral of mitral inflov. To validate this new Doppler echocardiographic filling index, Doppler echocardiographic and radionuclide-derived peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate,</b> both normalized to mitral stroke volume, were compared in 30 patients; there was an excellent correlation (r = 0. 91, SEE = 0. 88). This variable was not influenced by the position of the sample volume in relation to the mitral apparatus in contrast to early filling velocity, which increased 37 %, and early/late filling (E/A) ratio, which increased 43 % as the sample volume was moved from the anulus to the tips of the mitral leaflets. In a cohort of 22 normal patients, the mean peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> normalized to mitral stroke volume (SV) was 5. 25 ± 1. 47 SV/s. The mean peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> for a subgroup of eight normal patients aged 57 to 89 years (mean 71 ± 9) was 3. 9 ± 1 SV/s. In conclusion, normalization of peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> to mitral stroke volume minimizes technical errors involved in measuring Doppler echocardiographic peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> in the same fashion that normalization to end-diastolic volume minimizes technical errors involved in radionuclide angiographic {{measurement of}} peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate.</b> For this reason, peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> normalized to mitral stroke volume may provide a more reliable and reproducible method for assessing left ventricular filling.

The isovolumic relaxation period was determined automatically on left ventricular time-activity curves as the interval between minimal volume and onset of rapid filling. In 17 patients, M-mode echocardiography performed simultaneously with radionuclide angiography demonstrated that onset of mitral valve opening correlated well with onset of rapid filling (r = 0. 84, p < 0. 001). The isovolumic relaxation period was longer in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than in cdntrol subjects (95 ± 44 versus 50 ± 23 ms, p < 0. 01) and was longer in patients without an outflow tract gradient at rest than in patients with a gradient (109 ± 37 versus 86 ± 35 ms, p < 0. 05). In these patients without obstruction, a weak linear relation between duration of the isovolumic period and peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> was fodnd (r = 0. 48, p < 0. 02). Filling was impaired in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as assessed by lower peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> (3. 2 ± 1. 2 versus 3. 5 ± 0. 5 end-diastolic volume/s, p < 0. 05) and prolonged time to peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> (185 ± 44 versus 145 ± 20 ms, p < 0. 01) compared with values in control subjects. The delay in time to peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> was caused primarily by the prolonged isovolumic period, because the interval from onset of rapid filling to peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> was similar in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and control subjects (87 ± 31 versus 95 ± 25 ms, NS). Studies were repeated in 43 patients after administration of oral verapamil (320 to 640 mg/day). Verapamil decreased the isovolumic relaxation period (from 95 ± 42 to 80 ± 31 ms, p < 0. 05), associated with improved filling; peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> increased and time to peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> decreased. Thus, the delay in peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is caused by prolongation of the isovolumic period.

To study the relation between global and regional filling of LV, resting ECG-gated pool study was performed in 22 normal subjects and 24 patients with angina pectoris with isolated stenosis (＞ 75 %) of proximal LAD but without myocardial infarction. A computer program subdivided LV into four regions and the time-activity curves and the first derivative curves were computed in global LV and in each region (septal, apical and lateral region). End-systole of each region occurred very close to global end-systole in both groups.

In the septal and apical sides perfused by stenosed vessel, peak filling rates were slightly decreased in apical region (p＜. 02), but not in septal region (p=NS), and time to peak filling rates were prolonged in apical (p＜. 001) and in septal region (p＜. 001) in patients with angina pectoris compared with normal subjects.
