40|$|Volatile flavour {{substances}} {{were isolated}} from the minced pulp of half ripe and full ripe fruits of guava (Psidium guajava L.) cv. Lucknow- 49 by simultaneous steam distillation extraction (SDE) with diethyl ether as extracting solvent. The concentrate was analysed by GC-MS. Acetic, butyric and hexanoic acids were the predominant acids, trans- 2 -hexenal and hexanal the predominant aldehydes and ethyl propanoate, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, methyl hexanoate, ethyl hexanoate, cis- 3 -hexen- 1 -yl acetate, <b>hexyl</b> acetate, methyl <b>benzoate,</b> methyl octanoate, ethyl benzoate, phenylpropyl acetate and cinnamyl acetate, the esters responsible for the characteristic guava flavour were also present. The amount of total volatile substances was about 20 % higher in full ripe fruits. The concentration of acids and most esters increased and that of C 6 aldehydes decreased during ripening. The enzyme analysis showed that the polygalacturonase (PG) activity was lower in the ripe fruit, than in the half ripe one, while the β -galactosidase activity was not influenced by maturity stage. The surface and the cell walls of full ripe guava became wrinkled, and parenchyma cells were empty (SEM) ...|$|R
40|$|Ethylhexyl triazone (ET) was {{separated}} from other sunscreens such as avobenzone, octocrylene, octyl methoxycinnamate, and diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl <b>hexyl</b> <b>benzoate</b> and from parabens by normal-phase HPTLC on silica gel 60 as stationary phase. Two mobile phases were particularly effective: (A) cyclohexane-diethyl ether 1 [*]:[*] 1 (v/v) and (B) cyclohexane-diethyl ether-acetone 15 [*]:[*] 1 [*]:[*] 2 (v/v/v) since apart from ET analysis they facilitated separation and quantification of other sunscreens present in the formulations. Densitometric scanning was performed at 300 [*]nm. Calibration curves for ET were nonlinear (second-degree polynomials), with R > 0. 998. For both mobile phases limits of detection (LOD) were 0. 03 and limits of quantification (LOQ) 0. 1 [*]μg spot− 1. Both methods were validated...|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of 11 organic UV filters, worldwide authorised in sunscreen formulations, {{was performed by}} HPLC with UV spectrophotometric detection. The filters determined were: phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid, benzophenone-A, benzophenone- 3, A-methylbenzylidene camphor, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutyl phenol, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyltriazine, ethylhexyl triazone, and diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl <b>hexyl</b> <b>benzoate.</b> Three analytical methods were developed which were based on an ultrasonic extraction of the sample in methanol/ 1 % aqueous acetic acid (70 : 30, v/v) or dimethylacetamide/propan- 2 -ol (1 : 1, v/v) in dependence of the water or fat-solubility of the filter, followed by HPLC separation and quantitation. HPLC was carried out using three different columns and eluting conditions. Standard calibration curves were linear for all the analytes over the concentration range 0. 5 - 100 mu g mL(- 1). UV measurements were carried out at 280, 300, 310 or 360 nm {{with the aid of}} a diode array detector in dependence on the maximum absorption of each filter. Quantitative recoveries were obtained for all sunscreen compounds determined in homemade formulations. The proposed analytical procedure has been successfully applied for the analysis of commercial samples in order to check the presence of UV filters and to determine their concentration...|$|E
