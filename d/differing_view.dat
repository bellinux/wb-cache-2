5|$|Eleanor's son Elliott {{authored}} numerous books, {{including a}} mystery series in which Eleanor was the detective. However, these murder mysteries were researched and written by William Harrington. They continued until Harrington's death in 2000, {{ten years after}} Elliott's death. With James Brough, Elliot also wrote a highly personal book about his parents called The Roosevelts of Hyde Park: An Untold Story, in which he revealed details about the sexual lives of his parents, including his father's relationships with mistress Lucy Mercer and secretary Marguerite ("Missy") LeHand, as well as graphic details surrounding the illness that crippled his father. Published in 1973, the biography also contains valuable insights into FDR's run for vice-president, his rise to the governorship of New York, and his capture of the presidency in 1932, particularly {{with the help of}} Louis Howe. When Elliott published this book in 1973, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. led the family's denunciation of him; the book was fiercely repudiated by all Elliot's siblings. Another of the siblings, James, published My Parents, a <b>Differing</b> <b>View</b> (with Bill Libby, 1976), which was written in part as a response to Elliot's book. A sequel to An Untold Story with James Brough, published in 1975 and titled A Rendezvous With Destiny, carried the Roosevelt saga to the end of World War II. Mother R.: Eleanor Roosevelt's Untold Story, also with Brough, was published in 1977. Eleanor Roosevelt, with Love: A Centenary Remembrance, came out in 1984.|$|E

25|$|The {{struggle}} of Shaykh Uways against the Salihiyya {{was so intense}} that he was resolute to being a martyr (martin). Moving north to curb the influence of radical nationalist and puritanical teachings of Salihiya neo-Sufis, Shaykh Uways was tragically murdered by Salihiyya followers in 1909. His death {{came as a shock}} to even Salihiyya adherents. The Sayyid, however, composed a poem to celebrate his brotherhood's victory, although some northerners offer a <b>differing</b> <b>view</b> of the Sayyid's reaction.|$|E

500|$|The Constitution of the Anglican Church of Australia [...] "commit Anglicans to {{mainstream}} Christian orthodoxy", but its ruling principles direct {{it to that}} particular tradition within as [...] "represented by the Church of England". The Australian church had {{to work out the}} meaning of its common heritage [...] "in the context of the different cultures of the separate colonies" [...] but [...] "the way in which that faith pedigree was appealed to and interpreted... has highlighted differences." [...] Peter Carnley, former primate of the Anglican Church of Australia, has described Anglicanism's [...] "unique or essential identity" [...] as having [...] "not so much a body of theological teaching, as a style of theological reflection" [...] that goes back to the Elizabethan theologian Richard Hooker. St James' conforms to this Anglican tradition, part of which is a general dislike {{of what used to be}} referred to as 'Enthusiasm': that is, a dislike of [...] "pious individualism and emotional exuberance". St James' theological position in the liturgy is evidently consistent with Carnley's explanation that incarnational reality [...] "might be experienced with the aid of aesthetic, symbolic or sacramental aids to worship." [...] Such an adherence to the importance of the sacred and the sublime in worship remains in sharp contradistinction to practice in the surrounding mostly evangelical diocese, which typically eschews beauty and holds to an [...] "ultra-low ecclesiastical aesthetic" [...] that is combined with [...] "ultra-conservative social values". Teaching at St James' takes account of both the Biblical and contemporary historical context. In the Sydney diocese, St James's <b>differing</b> <b>view</b> has therefore been controversial since the 19th century as the various rectors led the church towards and away from Anglo-Catholicism. Micklem, for example, renewed Anglo-Catholic churchmanship and Davidson [...] "returned it firmly to a moderate position".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} have perceived {{a conflict between}} The Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations; the former emphasises sympathy for others, while the latter focuses {{on the role of}} self-interest. In recent years, however, some scholars of Smith's work have argued that no contradiction exists. They claim that in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the [...] "impartial spectator" [...] {{as a result of a}} natural desire to have outside observers sympathise with their sentiments. Rather than viewing The Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations as presenting incompatible views of human nature, some Smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation. Otteson argues that both books are Newtonian in their methodology and deploy a similar [...] "market model" [...] for explaining the creation and development of large-scale human social orders, including morality, economics, as well as language. Ekelund and Hebert offer a <b>differing</b> <b>view,</b> observing that self-interest is present in both works and that [...] "in the former, sympathy is the moral faculty that holds self-interest in check, whereas in the latter, competition is the economic faculty that restrains self-interest." ...|$|E
2500|$|References to {{both human}} and alien {{religion}} is often subtle and brief, but can also form the main theme of an episode. The first season episode [...] "The Parliament of Dreams" [...] is a conventional [...] "showcase" [...] for religion, in which each species on the Babylon 5 station {{has an opportunity to}} demonstrate its beliefs (humanity's are presented as being numerous and varied), while [...] "Passing Through Gethsemane" [...] focuses on a specific position of Roman Catholic beliefs, as well as concepts of justice, vengeance, and biblical forgiveness. Other treatments have been more contentious, such as the David Gerrold-scripted [...] "Believers", in which alien parents would rather see their son die than undergo a life-saving operation because their religious beliefs forbid it. When religion {{is an integral part of}} an episode, various characters express <b>differing</b> <b>view</b> points. Such as in [...] "Soul Hunter", where the concept of an immortal soul is touched upon, and whether after death it is destroyed, reincarnated, or simply does not exist. The character arguing the latter, Doctor Stephen Franklin, often appears in the more spiritual storylines as his scientific rationality is used to create dramatic conflict. Undercurrents of religions such as Buddhism have been viewed by some in various episode scripts, and while identifying himself as an atheist, Straczynski believes that passages of dialog can take on distinct meanings to viewers of differing faiths, and that the show ultimately expresses ideas which cross religious boundaries.|$|E
