2500|$|In {{the wake}} of his primary defeat, Mfume was {{believed}} to be considering running for mayor of Baltimore in 2007, though he had not publicly expressed interest in such a run. On November 13, 2006, Mfume told a Baltimore-area radio station that [...] "I don't have any plans to run for mayor. She 's worked for and deserves an opportunity to lead. ... <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> succeed. I want the city to be united. I think at this point we owe her at least the opportunity to try to lead it." [...] In late 2010, he was again rumored to be considering a run in the Baltimore mayoral election, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his time}} as UN Ambassador, Stevenson often {{traveled}} around the country promoting the United Nations in speeches and seminars. On these trips, he frequently faced opposition and protests from groups skeptical of the United Nations, such as the right-wing John Birch Society. In October 1963 Stevenson spoke in Dallas, Texas, where he was shouted down by unruly protestors led by retired General Edwin Walker's [...] "National Indignation Convention". At one point a woman hit Stevenson {{on the head with}} a sign, leading Stevenson to remark [...] "is she animal or human?", and telling a policeman [...] "I don't want her to go to jail, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go to school." [...] Afterwards, Stevenson warned President Kennedy's advisers about the [...] "ugly and frightening" [...] mood he had found in Dallas, but Kennedy went ahead with his planned visit to Dallas in late November 1963.|$|E

She had been an ambassador for six years, and frequently visits with families involved in the organization's Early Steps to School Success program, which coaches families to help children learn in the early years. In 2011 she partnered with Frigidaire as part of her work with Save The Children. In 2013, Garner took her eldest daughter Violet to a Save The Children gala in New York: [...] "My husband and I have never taken our kids to a public event before, but I brought my daughter Violet, because ... <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> see the passionate commitment Mark Shriver and Hillary Clinton have {{to make the world a}} better place for everyone." [...] In 2014, she joined the Invest in Us campaign., and in January 2015, she appeared in A Path Appears, a PBS documentary which focuses on rural poverty among children in West Virginia.|$|E
6000|$|... "So all I {{could do}} was {{to go back to}} the other room, and tell him that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go to sleep, and that he must not call out <b>to</b> <b>her</b> until I told him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{nothing to}} speak of," [...] replied Pan, nonchalantly. [...] "Reckon {{she was a}} little flustered because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> marry me this afternoon." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be cute but not beautiful. She {{looked like}} a young girl. I gave her a {{substantial}} overbite, her eyes were wide, her body was slim, she wasn't particularly busty. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> look almost elven, {{so that when you}} see {{her for the first time}} wearing full-make up and dressed in a provocative outfit where you know she's just been in bed with Deathstroke that it does jab you a bit. [...] "Whoa, good God! This little girl is a slut!" ...|$|R
60|$|LADY WINDERMERE. But I {{want to see}} her. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> come here.|$|E
6000|$|... "Before I {{had asked}} her to be my wife I had promised to be her brother. And so I will, if she should ever want a brother. I am not going to desert her because she will not do what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> do, or be what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be. She understands that. There is to be no quarrel between us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{understand}} because you're blind. She's sinned, and {{she must}} suffer. I know what she'll endure. She'll be starved and tortured and humiliated. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> accept the punishment of man as a sacrifice to God. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> accept it joyfully. She has an opportunity which is offered to very few of us. God is very good and very merciful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did not <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> make me happy. I do {{not expect}} to be made happy. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> do <b>her</b> duty. You were in love with her once, Mr. Finn?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Kit, {{blushing}} like a girl. [...] "When I got my post <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> promise {{she would}} marry me when I came back, but she refused." ...|$|R
6000|$|Papa did not understand, {{but the boy}} explained. [...] "She can't not {{never see}} them now," [...] he sobbed, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> see them, and they has pockets!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{more than}} ever. Strickland isn't {{the man to}} make a woman happy. It can't last. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> know that I shall never fail her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] said John, with a sigh. [...] "I say, Gracie, do {{you think}} the Fergusons like Lillie? <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be {{intimate}} with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} it's the worst I can do," [...] Newman {{would say in}} answer to this. [...] "Kindly {{overlook}} the deficiency." [...] He assured her that he, at least, would never scold her; she was perfectly satisfactory. [...] "If you only knew," [...] he said, [...] "how exactly you are what I coveted! And I am beginning to understand why I coveted it; the having it {{makes all the difference}} that I expected. Never was a man so pleased with his good fortune. You have been holding your head for a week past just as I wanted my wife to hold hers. You say just the things <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> say. You walk about the room just as <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> walk. You have just the taste in dress that <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> have. In short, you come up to the mark, and, I can tell you, my mark was high." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There!" [...] says Miss Grant, [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{see you in}} your braws {{like the}} lass of Limekilns. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> see what <b>I</b> could make of you, when I buckled to the job in earnest!" ...|$|R
60|$|You see, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> May Martha Mangum for to {{have and}} <b>to</b> hold. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> abide with me, and put my {{slippers}} and pipe away every day in places where they cannot be found of evenings.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Lambert looked away. [...] "I tried <b>to</b> {{reason with}} <b>her,</b> Anthony. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> 'sit for council,' but she's so crazy {{to get away}} she will not do it. She will hardly speak to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> soften {{and help}} me. She seems to draw and smooth away the evil, {{and to keep}} me from myself. Nothing is so dreary where she is.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said he; [...] "I want to {{telegraph}} to Miriam {{that you}} and I are engaged to be married. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> know it before she gets here. Shall I send it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are," [...] he {{answered}} unconsciously. [...] "I {{am sure that}} you are. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> tell me the whole truth about this extraordinary marriage. We will find some way out of it." ...|$|E
60|$|She laughed again. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go on talking, {{because her}} laugh was so delightful. But we {{had reached the}} road, {{and she said she}} must go back: there were so many things she had to do.|$|R
6000|$|Don Jer. Why, I {{never was}} so amazed in my life! Louisa gone off with Isaac Mendoza! What! steal {{away with the}} very man whom <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> marry--elope with <b>her</b> own husband, as it were--it is impossible! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm wery much {{attached}} to my wife, {{if you knew}} all about it, sir; and <b>I</b> <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> come home with me. Service ain't no inheritance; nor yet ain't wages, when they never amounts to more than twenty pounds a-year." ...|$|R
60|$|I do {{not know}} what Julia is going to do. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go to Detroit and board. She has many {{pleasant}} acquaintances there and she would find good schools for the children.|$|E
6000|$|... "No: its too much. The plain {{truth is}} that I dont care whether she finds me out or not. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} thoroughly, once and for ever, that I wont marry her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'As the Court clock strikes six, she says. And if I am {{not there}} to take her {{instructions}} of course she will give up the idea, which is just what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> do.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She doesn't {{care to be}} out, but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> come, and she's a good obliging girl, so she came," [...] said Shank, {{drawing her}} arm through his as they pressed forward against the blast in the {{direction}} of the shore.|$|R
60|$|When Sally got {{out alone}} with me {{she made me}} ride <b>to</b> keep <b>her</b> from disappearing somewhere on the horizon. This morning <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> enjoy <b>to</b> the fullest <b>her</b> utter freedom and to feel that for once I could not catch her.|$|R
5000|$|Rennison {{said that}} she wrote not {{in an attempt to}} teach, but to make herself laugh. She said, [...] "I wanted Georgia to be a decent person. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be someone who is a bit stupid and self-obsessed and {{difficult}} and funny and rude, and a bit jealous and all those other things. But <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> have a good heart." [...] Rennison also said that her books were not just for teenage girls, but aimed to have a [...] "potential resonance beyond the young." [...] In particular, Rennison often brought feminist ideals into <b>her</b> writing. She <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> books <b>to</b> get girls talking and deciding for themselves {{what they wanted to do}} and who they wanted to be, rather than letting men decide for them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Poor Laura!' said Guy. 'Could not {{you write}} a note to her too? <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be told that I am very sorry, if I ever gave her pain by {{speaking}} thoughtlessly of him.' ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Harrison {{has had a}} dream which {{promises}} me a large bank account, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{go ahead}} and dream it twice more, {{so as to make}} the prediction sure to be fulfilled.|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand, madam," [...] he said, [...] "and I am {{grateful}} to you for consenting to take her. She is getting too old now to wander about with me, and since the narrow escape she had, last time I was here, I have felt anxious whenever {{she was out of}} my sight. It would not suit me to put her in a farm house. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> learn to speak nicely, and I have done my best to teach her; but if she went to a farm house she would be picking up all sorts of country words, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> talk like a little lady.|$|E
6000|$|... "I told you," [...] {{the other}} went on, [...] "that Mr. Fortescue {{said that he}} had no {{personal}} objection to me, but that if I {{was in a position to}} give his daughter a home equal <b>to</b> that which <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> leave, he would be content." ...|$|R
6000|$|We got on {{together}} admirably. I {{was introduced}} as [...] "Mrs. Woodville," [...] by previous {{arrangement with the}} Major--effected through Benjamin. Before the dinner was over we had promised to exchange visits. Nothing but the opportunity was wanting to lead Lady Clarinda into talking, as <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> talk, of Mrs. Beauly.|$|R
60|$|I did not wake Rectus to {{tell him}} the news. It would not do any good, and I was afraid Corny might hear us. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> sleep as long as she could, and, indeed, I dreaded the moment when she should awake, and find that all had been given up.|$|R
