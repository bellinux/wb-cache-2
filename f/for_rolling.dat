5|$|Based on the study, Governor William O'Neill ordered ConnDOT in October 1986 to {{initiate}} rail {{service on the}} corridor. It was established as a temporary service to newly reopened local stations between Union Station in New Haven and Old Saybrook, to alleviate traffic congestion that arose from scheduled construction work on I-95. O'Neill introduced a $50 million transportation program that included $900,000 (later reduced to $500,000) for basic stations and $4 million to refurbish 12 Budd Rail Diesel Cars <b>for</b> <b>rolling</b> stock. The RDCs {{were found to be}} insufficient and two diesel trainsets were purchased from the defunct PATrain service in 1989 instead.

Maida Vale and Kilburn Park were provided with buildings {{in the style of the}} earlier Leslie Green stations but without the upper storey, which was no longer required for housing lift gear. Warwick Avenue was accessed from a subway under the street. The LNWR rebuilt Queen's Park station with additional platforms for the Bakerloo Tube's and its own electric services and constructed two train sheds <b>for</b> <b>rolling</b> stock, one each side of the station.|$|E
