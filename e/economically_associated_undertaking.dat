The evaluation was undertaken by the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) over the period 2010 to 2012. The basic design of the TFA Pathway is as follows: 1. High-achieving university graduates are recruited nationally. Applicants are subject to a rigorous recruitment process and are {{selected on the basis of}} qualities and skills suitable to the teaching profession, and the possession of a genuine desire to reduce educational disadvantage. 2. Selected applicants (termed <b>Associates)</b> <b>undertake</b> six weeks of initial residential intensive education prior to commencing a two-year placement as an Associate in a disadvantaged secondary school (the Placement School). 3. <b>Associates</b> <b>undertake</b> a two-year employment-based course involving continued study toward a qualification in teaching; a teaching role with a 0. 8 FTE reduced load, and the support of an in-school teacher Mentor. 4. Further support is provided fortnightly by a Clinical Specialist (Melbourne Graduate School of Education, MGSE) and a Training and Leadership Adviser (TFA). 5. Associates are placed in secondary schools in geographic ‘clusters’, allowing for multiple Associates within a school and within a region to ensure Associates have access to peer-support. 6.

40|$|I explore an empirically robust but {{previously}} undocumented {{association between}} the foreign exchange reserves accumulated by central banks of emerging market economies and dollar-denominated debt held in the balance sheets of non financial sector firms. Borrowing in dollars can have damaging effects on corporate balance sheets {{in the event of}} exchange rate depreciation. However, firms may discount such risk because of the implicit insurance provided by the central banks ex-ante reserve accumulation: {{in the event of a}} currency depreciation, firms may expect the central bank to stabilize the exchange rate using its stock of reserves. Using a novel firm-level balance sheet database, I investigate this possibility for close to 1500 firms in six of the largest Latin American economies, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Results suggest that over the sample period, 1995 - 2007, an increase in the level of reserves is statistically and <b>economically</b> <b>associated</b> with an increase in the dollar borrowing of non financial sector firms of these economies. This could hint at a possible paradox: a higher level of reserves need not necessarily signify an economy that is more resilient to shocks. While reserve accumulation enables governments to weather macroeconomic risks arising from sudden stops in international capital flows, it can also increase the vulnerability of the corporate sector to currency risks by distorting incentives. Thus central banks, while formulating their foreign exchange intervention policies, may need to take into consideration the impact of the resultant reserve stockpiling on the private sector...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Conference {{staff and}} leaders, espousing the {{predominantly}} liberal outlook of the denomination, made extraordinary efforts to encourage churches to pursue aims such as advocating {{for peace in}} Vietnam, improved racial relations, and formulating a more articulate and relevant faith {{for the needs of}} the younger generations. This was particularly remarkable because Conference ministers, and <b>associates,</b> <b>undertook</b> these aims in addition to the daunting task of servicing the needs of churches spread over a seven-state region, which entailed much time and expense in travel and meetings distant from the Atlanta headquarters. Some churches were quite enthusiastic about all of these programs, engaging in experimental ministries and worship; others, mostly those outside the major metropolitan areas, resisted what they saw as an intrusion upon their traditions and autonomy, and these gradually began keeping to themselves, often only supporting their associations or customary benevolences. By the 1990s, many congregations simply decided to withdraw and form their own groupings or, just as often, become totally independent, a trait increasingly noticeable also among recently established churches of fundamentalist or charismatic persuasion in the region. Those moves reduced the six associations down to four.|$|R

40|$|Still intensifying in {{the second}} halí of the 20 -th century {{disintegration}} of the world market causes undertaking various attempts towards its former unity. Many integration concepts are postulated, among others ideas of universalism and regionalism. The first concept assumes restoration of the world-wide order owing to multilateral agreements doing away with protective and regulating actions in the world. In turn, regionalists formulate opinions that universalization of the world economic relations can be achieved only by means of co-operation intensification and liberalization of economic relations within definite regions, and only these regions — after establishing co-operation relations — introduce the world-wide economic order. The author accords in principle {{with the ideas of}} regionalists stating that practical realization of the universalists' recommendations is not real enough to-day. In subsequent parts of the paper the author surveys developing integration processes in several world regions. Pointing out that these processes are grounded by conviction of <b>economically</b> <b>associated</b> countries that integration can create a real power of economic development, the author states that these countries can be delivered from the hegemony of economically developed countries simultaneously. Basing himself on a broad analysas of situation and achievements of particular regional integration groupings the author concludes that the process of universalization of world economic relations starts only after increasing economic significance of particular relations by way of concluded agreements and treaties. Only then the present trends to subordinate the world to the small group of rich countries can be replaced by a "new economic order" based on the principle of equality, mutual respect and regard to advantages of all participants of international economic relations.
