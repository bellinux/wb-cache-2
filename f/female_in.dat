5000|$|While {{the average}} weight of females does not differ {{between high and}} low-density {{population}} conditions reproductive output is greater in low-density conditions compared to high-density conditions. <b>Females</b> <b>in</b> high-density conditions also experience a higher mortality rate.

5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the male}} and <b>female</b> <b>in</b> any particular species are adapted to fit each other like a lock (male) and key (<b>female).</b> <b>In</b> males, the ninth abdominal segment is divided into a dorsal 'tegumen' and ventral 'viniculum'. They form a ring-like structure for the attachment of genital parts {{and a pair of}} lateral clasping organs (claspers or 'harpe'). The male has a median tubular organ (called the aedeagus) which is extended through an eversible sheath (or 'vesica') to inseminate the female. The males have paired sperm ducts in all lepidopterans; the paired testes are separate in basal taxa and fused in advanced forms.|$|E
5|$|Among {{domestic}} cats, {{males are}} more likely to fight than females. Among feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a <b>female.</b> <b>In</b> such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male. Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home. Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones.|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{determine}} {{in a large}} {{series of}} surgical biopsies, the frequency of various histologic types of primary solid malignant neoplasms <b>in</b> males and <b>females</b> <b>in</b> different age groups.

5|$|Another {{interesting}} {{habit of}} males {{of this and}} other fairywren species during the reproductive season is to pluck petals (in this species, predominantly pink and purple ones which contrast with their plumage) and show them to female fairywrens. Petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a <b>female</b> <b>in</b> the male fairywren's own or another territory. Outside the breeding season males may sometimes still show petals to females in other territories, presumably to promote themselves. It is notable that fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous: pairs will bond for life, but regularly mate with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting. Thus, petal-carrying might be a behaviour that strengthens the pair-bond. Petal carrying might also be a way for extra males to gain matings with the <b>female.</b> <b>In</b> either case, the data does not strongly link petal-carrying and presenting to a copulation soon thereafter.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown high rates of {{psychopathology}} among <b>female</b> adolescents <b>in</b> detention. Although rates of mental health problems have been called alarming, it is unknown whether mental health needs <b>in</b> <b>females</b> <b>in</b> juvenile justice differ substantially from those of <b>females</b> <b>in</b> mental health care. Therefore, this study compared adolescent <b>females</b> <b>in</b> detention with inpatient adolescent females. For this purpose, a sample of 256 detained females (mean age 15. 4 ± 1. 3) was compared to 45 psychiatric inpatient females (mean age 15. 8 ± 1. 4). Socio-demographic characteristics, mental health history and psychiatric problems were investigated using file-information and self-report questionnaires. Compared to detained females, inpatients more often showed internalizing problems and dissociation, whereas externalizing problems prevailed in girls <b>in</b> detention centers. <b>Females</b> <b>in</b> detention more often came from an ethnic minority group, while <b>females</b> <b>in</b> mental healthcare more often received mental healthcare previously and had parents with higher employment. This study confirms that mental health needs of girls in mental healthcare and in detention are high. However, non-mental health related factors were different as well - i. e. socio-economic factors - {{and are likely to}} influence the involvement with either service sector. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
