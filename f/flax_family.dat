50|$|Construction of the Bessbrook and Newry Tramway {{began in}} 1883, and the {{enterprise}} was incorporated in 1884, after the Tramways and Public Companies (Ireland) Act 1883 came into effect. It was built {{primarily on the}} own land of its owners, the Richardsons, and was intended to carry workers and freight from the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) GNR(I), in Newry to the <b>family's</b> <b>flax</b> mill in Bessbrook. In July 1884 Edward Hopkinson was contacted by the company, the Bessbrook Spinning Company to undertake the installation operation of electric traction for the line - the terms were that Hopkinson would provide locomotive power to operating ten trains each way every day, carrying 100 tons of freight a day, and with a capacity to haul 200 tons a day, with the locomotives able to pull 18 tons gross at 6 mph in addition to locomotive and passengers in the uphill direction (12 tons at 9 mph). Additionally Hopkinson was to run the line on a six-month trial, showing {{that the cost of}} operation was not more than that of steam traction. The work began in November 1884, with the line opening in October 1885; the terms of the trial were met in April 1886.|$|R
40|$|Background: Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is an {{economically}} important fiber and oil crop {{that has been}} grown for thousands of years. The genome has been recently sequenced and transcriptomics are providing information on candidate genes potentially related to agronomically-important traits. In order to accelerate functional characterization of these genes we have generated a flax EMS mutant population {{that can be used}} as a TILLinG (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes) platform for forward and reverse genetics. Results: A population of 4, 894 M 2 mutant seed families was generated using 3 different EMS concentrations (0. 3 %, 0. 6 % and 0. 75 %) and used to produce M 2 plants for subsequent phenotyping and DNA extraction. 10, 839 viable M 2 plants (4, 033 families) were obtained and 1, 552 families (38. 5 %) showed a visual developmental phenotype (stem size and diameter, plant architecture, flower-related). The majority of these families showed more than one phenotype. Mutant phenotype data are organised in a database and can be accessed and searched at UTILLdb ([URL] Preliminary screens were also performed for atypical fiber and seed phenotypes. Genomic DNA was extracted from 3, 515 M 2 families and eight-fold pooled for subsequent mutant detection by ENDO 1 nuclease mis-match cleavage. In order to validate the collection for reverse genetics, DNA pools were screened for two genes coding enzymes of the lignin biosynthesis pathway: Coumarate- 3 -Hydroxylase (C 3 H) and Cinnamyl Alcohol Dehydrogenase (CAD). We identified 79 and 76 mutations in the C 3 H and CAD genes, respectively. The average mutation rate was calculated as 1 / 41 Kb giving rise to approximately 9, 000 mutations per genome. Thirty-five out of the 52 <b>flax</b> cad mutant <b>families</b> containing missense or codon stop mutations showed the typical orange-brown xylem phenotype observed in CAD down-regulated/mutant plants in other species. Conclusions: We have developed a flax mutant population that {{can be used as a}}n efficient forward and reverse genetics tool. The collection has an extremely high mutation rate that enables the detection of large numbers of independant mutant families by screening a comparatively low number of M 2 families. The population will prove to be a valuable resource for both fundamental research and the identification of agronomically-important genes for crop improvement in flax...|$|R
