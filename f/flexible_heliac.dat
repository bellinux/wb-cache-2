50|$|TJ-II is a <b>flexible</b> <b>Heliac</b> {{installed}} at Spain's National Fusion Laboratory.|$|E
50|$|The <b>flexible</b> <b>Heliac</b> TJ-II was {{designed}} {{on the basis}} of calculations performed by the team of physicists and engineers of CIEMAT, in collaboration with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL, USA) and the Max Planck Institute of Plasma Physics (IPP, Germany). The TJ-II project received preferential support from the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) for phase I (Physics) in 1986 and for phase II (Engineering) in 1990. The construction of this <b>flexible</b> <b>Heliac</b> was carried out in parts according to its constitutive elements, which were commissioned to various European companies, although 60% of the investments reverted to Spanish companies.|$|E
50|$|Heliac: A helical axis stellarator, {{in which}} the {{magnetic}} axis (and plasma) follows a helical path to form a toroidal helix rather than a simple ring shape. The twisted plasma induces twist in the magnetic field lines to effect drift cancellation, and typically can provide more twist than the Torsatron or Heliotron, especially near {{the centre of the}} plasma (magnetic axis). The original Heliac consists only of circular coils, and the <b>flexible</b> <b>heliac</b> (H-1NF, TJ-II, TU-Heliac) adds a small helical coil to allow the twist to be varied by a factor of up to 2.|$|E

Major research facilities at the school include the 14UD NEC Pelletron accelerator and associated modular superconducting linac run by the Department of Nuclear Physics, the H-1NF <b>flexible</b> Stellarator <b>Heliac</b> run by the Plasma Research Laboratory plus an extensive range of smaller experimental and computational equipment.|$|R
50|$|The H-1 <b>flexible</b> <b>Heliac</b> is a three field-period helical axis {{stellarator}} {{located in}} the ANU Research School of Physics and Engineering at Canberra, Australia. Optimisation of the H-1 power supplies for low current ripple allows precise control of the ratio of secondary (helical, vertical) coil to primary (poloidal, toroidal) coil currents, resulting in a finely tunable magnetic geometry. Slight variation in the current ratio between shots (plasma discharges) in a sequence corresponds to a high resolution parameter scan through magnetic configurations (i.e.: rotational transform profile, magnetic well). The programmable control system allows for repetition rates of around 30 shots per hour, limited by data acquisition time and magnet cooling time.|$|E

40|$|The {{capability}} of the TJ-II <b>Flexible</b> <b>Heliac</b> to obtain configurations with different magnetic parameters {{has been used in}} the last experimental campaign to introduce different rational values in the iota profile at several radial positions. Evidence of E x B shear near some rationals has been observed pointing to some possible explanation for transport barier formation. This issue is of utmost importance for so called "advanced " regimes in steady state plasmas. A description is also given of the last experiments conducted in TJ-II and their results.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{presentation}} of the most relevant recent Physics results obtained in the TJ-II <b>flexible</b> <b>heliac.</b> Firstly ECRH modulation and plasma breakdown studies are summarised; then the particle control techniques used to obtain reproducible discharges with density under control are presented. Transport studies show internal heat transport barriers that reduce heat conductivity to neoclassical values, and ELM-like transport events, similar to those observed in tokamaks and in other stellarators before and during H mode transition.

40|$|The {{construction}} and {{assembly of the}} <b>flexible</b> <b>Heliac</b> TJ-II located at the Centro de Investigaciones Energ 6 ticas MedioAmbientales y Tecnol 6 gicas (CIEMAT), Madrid, has recently been finished. The problems encountered during manufacturing this strongly helical machine have been solved satisfactory. Nevertheless the complicated geometry, the low magnetic permeability of all materials and the required narow tolerances, created real challenges for all the component manufacturers. First measurements of the magnetic surfaces in the device have been done, using the fluorescent rod technique at electron energies between 100 and 200 eY. A very good agreement has being found between magnetic surface measurements and theoretical predictions. Plasma operation with 1 MW, 53. 2 Ghz, ECH system is about to start.

40|$|Abstract: H- 1 is a helical axis {{stellarator}} {{of major}} radius R= 1 m, and average minor radius ~ 0. 15 - 0. 2 m. Its <b>flexible</b> <b>heliac</b> coil set permits {{access to a}} wide range of magnetic configurations. RFgenerated plasma shows a very complex dependence on configuration of both the electron density and the nature of fluctuations. Magnetic fluctuations range from highly coherent, often multi-frequency in sequence or simultaneously, to approaching broad-band (df/f ~ 0. 02 - 0. 5), in the range 1 - 200 kHz. Application of datamining {{to a wide range}} of configurations classifies these fluctuations and extracts poloidal and toroidal mode numbers, revealing that a significant class of fluctuations exhibit scaling which is Alfvénic with electron density (within a constant factor) and shear Alfvénic in rotational transform. An array of optical and interferometric diagnostics is combined with the magnetic probe arrays to provide information on internal structure of the MHD modes, and associated 3 D effects. The configurational dependence is closely related to the presence of low order rational surfaces. The plasma density falls to very low values at these rationals prompting the question: how much is this due to the effect of magnetic islands?

40|$|The <b>flexible</b> <b>Heliac</b> {{coil set}} of helical axis {{stellarator}} H- 1 (R= 1 m, ~ 0. 15 - 0. 2 m) permits {{access to a}} wide range of magnetic configurations. Surprisingly, in the absence of any obvious population of energetic particles, Alfven modes normally associated with energetic populations in larger fusion experiments are observed. Using H- 1 's unique combination of flexibility and advanced diagnostics, RF-generated plasma in H- 1 is shown to have a very complex dependence on configuration of both the electron density and fluctuations in the MHD Alfven range. Magnetic fluctuations range from highly coherent, often multi-frequency, to approaching broad-band (df/f ~ 0. 02 - 0. 5), in the range 1 - 200 kHz. Application of datamining techniques {{to a wide range}} of configurations classifies these fluctuations and extracts poloidal and toroidal mode numbers, revealing that a significant class of fluctuations exhibit scaling which is i) Alfvenic with electron density (within a constant factor) and ii) shear Alfvenic in rotational transform. This is confirmed by scans within a single pulse, which can follow mode conversions. An array of optical and interferometric diagnostics is combined with the magnetic probe arrays to provide initial information on the internal structure of the MHD modes, and associated 3 D effects. The configurational dependence is closely related to the presence of low order rational surfaces; density falls to very low values near, but not precisely at these rational values. Results from a uniquely accurate magnetic field mapping system, combined with a comprehensive model of the vacuum magnetic field in H- 1 show that magnetic islands should not dominate the confinement of the configuration, and indicate that the dependence of density on configuration may be attributable to plasma generation effects.

40|$|Magneto {{hydrodynamic}} (MHD) instabilities in magnetically confined plasmas {{are responsible}} for different phenomena of relevance in the transport of particles and energy. Plasma oscillations can limit the operational space of most experimental devices, therefore their study and understanding may lead to find the way to control them and achieving better plasma performance. In the <b>flexible</b> <b>heliac</b> device TJ-II, an almost current-free and low magnetic shear stellarator, collective oscillations are commonly observed in plasmas heated with microwave or neutral particle beams. Frequently, low mode number oscillations, systematically linked to low order rational values of the rotational transform (namely, to their associated magnetic islands chain), are found to lead fast-particle and/or thermal-plasma confinement degradation. The present work summarizes some studies performed in the TJ-II stellarator to investigate the role of magnetic islands dynamics in plasma confinement. Tearing mode (TM) activity is often detected as intense and coherent modes in Mirnov coils signal spectra during the low-confinement phase (L-mode) of neutral beam (NBI) heated plasmas. Their rotation speed is generally close to the plasma flow velocity and the resolved mode numbers correspond to the lowest rational values contained in the rotational transform profile of each magnetic configuration, so the measured mode frequencies are rather low (tens of kHz) and scale with their poloidal mode number. Nevertheless, under co-NBI heating (that flattens the magnetic shear profile), the rotating structures can become faster than the plasma flow, apparently driven by an additional velocity in the electron diamagnetic drift direction. At some critical plasma conditions dependent on plasma profiles, the TM may change their stable behaviour into a pulsed magnetic activity. Mirnov coil signals show repeated magnetic bursts and their spectrograms reveal that stable modes change into intermittent (with≈ 1 ms repetition period) frequency stripes starting at around doubled frequency and rapidly (≈ 0. 3 ms) decreasing to frequencies slightly above the stable rotation value. Coinciding with the magnetic pulses, collapses of small intensity local transport barriers are observed, akin to minor disruptions, and during the magnetic fluctuations-free periods, barriers build up again. This cyclic process, resembling an ELMy-like phase, can be sustained, if heating and/or fuelling are not modified. As well, rotating islands, which in essence provide a wave for the magnetic components, can interact with shear Alfven waves giving rise to new coherent modes. This new coupling of TM with Alfven waves has been identified {{for the first time}} in TJ-II in L-mode plasmas under full NBI power (≈ 0. 9 MW). On the other hand, magnetic islands can be locked in the laboratory frame, as is the magnetic field itself in stellarators. The interaction of shear-Alfven waves with static magnetic island chains might open new gaps in the continuum spectrum, which would enable for the existence of weakly damped Alfvenic modes. This kind of wave coupling, MIAEs (magnetic island induced Alfven eigenmode), has been proposed to explain the origin of some Alfvenic waves in the intermediate frequency range (fTM < f < fHAE) during NBI heating in TJ-II. Acoustic like modes with frequencies in the range of 15 - 40 kHz have been first identified in TJ-II during Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) heating, where a considerable population of fast electrons is generated. They exhibit standing wave like behaviour in the poloidal plane, as geodesic acoustic modes (GAM), but propagate at around the ion sound speed in the toroidal direction, as ion sound waves (ISW). Their fundamental mode number is (m= 2, n= 1), and frequency scales with acoustic speed. Modes can be occasionally bursting in intensity with rapid decreases in frequency (≈ 20 %), in coincidence with pulses of fast electron lost from the plasma core, which may suggest a nonlinear interaction of acoustic mode with fast electrons in velocity space. The necessary condition for exciting the acoustic modes is having finite size low-order magnetic islands in the plasma bulk, likely because the long confinement time of fast electrons in the vicinity of islands favours wave-fast electron interaction. The results of the studies described in this thesis show that rational surfaces may help to regulate plasma transport due to the multiple means that they interact with thermal plasma, fast particle populations, and plasma waves. We hope that this work can contribute to future stellarator design and operation procedures.
