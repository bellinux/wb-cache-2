5|$|The area's {{population}} has declined <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>peak</b> of around 2700 in 1926 {{to its current}} level of around 1200. This decline has halted in recent decades, with 2008 figures being {{very similar to those}} of 1986.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the types}} of insects {{consumed}} are many families of beetles, wasps and ants, flies (families Tabanidae and Asilidae), bugs, and caterpillars. Other invertebrates eaten include spiders, millipedes and earthworms. The flame robin consumes small prey items whole, and bashes larger victims against a hard surface repeatedly to break up before eating. The latter group constitute only 0.5% of prey over time—seasonally varying <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>peak</b> of 1.8% in autumn {{to a low of}} 0.2% of prey caught in winter.|$|E
5|$|Dayton's {{population}} declined significantly <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>peak</b> of 262,332 {{residents in}} 1960 to only 141,527 in 2010. This {{was in part}} due to the slowdown of the region's manufacturing and the growth of Dayton's affluent suburbs including Oakwood, Englewood, Beavercreek, Springboro, Miamisburg, Kettering, and Centerville. The city's most populous ethnic group, white, declined from 78.1% in 1960 to 51.7% by 2010. However, recent census estimates show a 1.3% population increase since 2010, the first increase in five decades.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, {{new housing}} estates were built north-west of the town. This was {{followed}} by the redevelopment of the town centre in the 1960s and 1970s, which destroyed much of the old high street. There was speculation that the town's population could increase to around 55–60,000 by 1970. This did not happen: a decline in the linoleum industry in the mid-1960s led to a decrease in population, <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>peak</b> of 53,750 in 1961 to 47,962 in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Nabulsi soap or sabon nabulsi {{is a type}} of castile soap {{produced}} only in Nablus and made of three primary ingredients: virgin olive oil, water, and a sodium compound. Since the 10th century, Nabulsi soap has enjoyed a reputation for being a fine product, and has been exported across the Arab world and to Europe. Though the number of soap factories decreased <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>peak</b> of thirty in the 19th century to only two today, efforts to preserve this important part of Palestinian and Nabulsi cultural heritage continue.|$|E
5|$|Osteopathic {{physicians}} have historically entered primary care fields {{at a higher}} rate than their M.D. counterparts. Some osteopathic organizations make claims to a greater emphasis on the importance of primary care within osteopathic medicine. However, the proportion of osteopathic students choosing primary care fields, like that of their M.D. peers, is declining. Currently, only one in five osteopathic medical students enters a family medicine residency (the largest primary care field). In 2004, only 32% of osteopathic seniors planned careers in any primary care field; this percentage was down <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>peak</b> in 1996 of more than 50%.|$|E

5|$|The last {{relic of}} the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, the Fairfield Plant, {{continues}} to be operated by U. S. Steel {{as one of its}} five integrated steel mills in the USA. It is the largest steel-making plant in Alabama, employing 2,000 workers as of September 2006, down <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>peak</b> of 45,000 during World War II. With a single blast furnace and three basic oxygen process furnaces, amongst other various mills and production facilities, the plant produces 2.4 million tons of raw steel per annum and 640,000 tons of seamless tubular and sheet products, mainly for purchase by the booming oil industry.|$|E
5|$|Where possible, the University of Chicago {{attempted}} to re-employ workers {{who had been}} transferred from the Metallurgical Laboratory to other projects once their work had ended. Replacing staff was nearly impossible, as Groves had ordered a staffing freeze. The only division to grow between November 1944 and March 1945 was the health division; all the rest lost 20 {{percent or more of}} their staff. <b>From</b> <b>a</b> <b>peak</b> of 2,008 staff on 1 July 1944, the number of people working at the Metallurgical Laboratory fell to 1,444 on 1 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Localized but {{extensive}} {{power outages}} were reported across {{areas that were}} hit by significant amounts of ice. At {{the peak of the}} storm over 300,000 customers lost power across the United States. In the Cincinnati area, 122,000 were without power at one point with 52,000 still blacked out as of Wednesday morning. All had been restored by Tuesday morning. About 7,500 customers in Indiana near the Indianapolis region were still without power on February 15, down <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>peak</b> of about 50,000 especially in the Bloomington area. Other states that reported outages included Kentucky (14,000), Maryland (at least 135,000 customers, including 69,000 in Anne Arundel County and 25,000 in Prince George's County, Maryland), New Jersey (36,000), Pennsylvania (10,000 in the Pittsburgh region), Virginia (7,800), and New York (18,000) on Long Island. By 10:00 am Thursday, February 15, about 73,000 homes were without electricity in the Washington DC metropolitan area. Most of those outages were from an ice storm that hit areas from the southern Ohio Valley towards the Atlantic Coast.|$|E

5|$|Minority {{ethnic groups}} include white Zimbabweans, {{who make up}} less than 1% of the total {{population}}. White Zimbabweans are mostly of British origin, {{but there are also}} Afrikaner, Greek, Portuguese, French and Dutch communities. The white population dropped <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>peak</b> of around 278,000 or 4.3% of the population in 1975 to possibly 120,000 in 1999, and was estimated to be no more than 50,000 in 2002, and possibly much less. The 2012 census lists the total white population at 28,782 (roughly 0.22% of the population), one-tenth of its 1975 estimated size. Most emigration has been to the United Kingdom (between 200,000 and 500,000 Britons are of Rhodesian or Zimbabwean origin), South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Coloureds form 0.5% of the population, and various Asian ethnic groups, mostly of Indian and Chinese origin, are also 0.5%.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the copper shark as Near Threatened worldwide. While the global population is unknown, the long maturation time and low reproductive rate {{of this species}} render it highly susceptible to overfishing. Regionally, the IUCN has listed this species under Least Concern off Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, where fisheries are generally well-managed; the local copper shark population for each of those three countries is contained almost entirely within their respective Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Reported catches by New Zealand have steadily declined <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>peak</b> of 40 tons in 1995/96 to 20 tons 2001/02, though it is uncertain whether this reflects a genuine decline or changing fishing habits.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} Tkach’s tenure {{as the head}} of the WCG was notable. Church income dropped from a high of over $200 million in 1990 to $50 million by 1996. By then the church could only count 49,000 as members, less than half from its peak. The {{circulation}} of The Plain Truth, distributed free by subscription and via newsstand distribution around the globe, fell <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>peak</b> of 8,000,000 to less than 100,000 before it switched to a paid subscription status. Eventually the magazine was spun off into a separate, independent, evangelical ministry. The number of employees at the church headquarters fell from 1,000 to about 50. Ambassador University, as the college had become after earning regional accreditation in Texas, ceased operations in 1997 as the church could no longer provide its annual operating subsidy. The Pasadena campus was finally sold in 2004.|$|E
