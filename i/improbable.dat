5|$|The score employs drums, flutes and chanting. The film's sounds {{also include}} bells heard in <b>improbable</b> places.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who have}} {{had much to do}} with Oriental monks will {{understand}} how <b>improbable</b> it is that the terms of the arrangement, whatever it was, were ever known to any except of the leaders.|$|E
5|$|Due to its location, the Church of St Peter {{is often}} {{described}} as a cemetery church. However, scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it <b>improbable</b> that an ordinary village cemetery church would have an inscription by a Bulgarian tsar. In her opinion, {{it is more likely that}} the church was constructed by a noble person related to the court of the Second Bulgarian Empire.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{this series}} of events is {{extremely}} <b>improbable.</b> Constantius had already left Helena {{by the time he}} left for Britain. Additionally, no earlier source mentions that Helena was born in Britain, let alone that she was a princess. Henry's source for the story is unknown, though {{it may have been a}} lost hagiography of Helena.|$|E
5|$|Planet Nine is a {{hypothetical}} large {{planet in the}} far outer Solar System, the gravitational effects of which would explain the <b>improbable</b> orbital configuration {{of a group of}} trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) that orbit mostly beyond the Kuiper belt.|$|E
5|$|The film {{may have}} been {{inspired}} by the real 1909 strike of the New York City shirtwaist makers, but the strike ended without settlement. The scenario is bears the hallmarks of the successful dime novels with an <b>improbable</b> resolution. Released on July 8, 1910, the film has received attention for presenting labor issues, but the film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Bulk {{francium}} {{has never}} been viewed. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, {{it is assumed that}} francium would appear as a highly reactive metal, if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly <b>improbable,</b> since the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of its longest-lived isotope is only 22 minutes) would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.|$|E
5|$|Estimates for {{the cavalry}} are {{usually in the}} 1,000–3,000 range. The Persian cavalry was usually {{provided}} by the ethnic Persians, Bactrians, Medes, Cissians, and Saka; most of these probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry. The fleet must {{have had at least}} some proportion of transport ships, since the cavalry was carried by ship; whilst Herodotus claims the cavalry was carried in the triremes, this is <b>improbable.</b> Lazenby estimates 30–40 transport ships would be required to carry 1,000 cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, matter {{itself is}} {{expected}} to come {{under the influence of}} radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. Current data suggest that the universe has a flat geometry (or very close to flat), and thus, will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively <b>improbable</b> events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus also recounts that King Alexander I of Macedonia (an {{ancestor}} of Alexander the Great,) who was allied to the Persians and present in their camp, secretly rode to the Greek camp {{with a warning}} that the Persians had decided to attack, and that before the main battle Mardonius issued {{a challenge to the}} Spartans to fight a special battle between equal numbers of Spartans and Persians, which was declined. Some historians have called these stories <b>improbable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nature {{has been}} more than lavish in her gifts to St. Johns. Travel as many miles as you like and go where you will, it is highly <b>improbable</b> that you will find a spot with so many {{magnificent}} nature advantages as has St. Johns. The fine stretch of level land on which the city is located, the deep water of the two rivers, the navigable sloughs and the superb scenery which nature has painted with a master hand, makes the location an ideal one in every respect either for industries or residences.|$|E
5|$|Not {{known for}} his {{offensive}} ability, Regehr ended a 100-game goal scoring drought early in the season, finishing with four for the season. He set a career high with 18 points, and was {{a key player in}} the Flames <b>improbable</b> run to the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals facing top opposition players. He played the final two games of the Stanley Cup Final despite tearing ligaments in his foot in game five. His performance in the post season earned him the praise of his opponents.|$|E
5|$|Some sources {{assert that}} Mickiewicz's mother was descended from a converted, Frankist Jewish family. Others {{view this as}} <b>improbable.</b> Polish {{historian}} Kazimierz Wyka, in his biographic entry in Polski Słownik Biograficzny (1975) writes that this hypothesis, {{based on the fact}} that his mother's maiden name, Majewska, was popular among Frankist Jews, has not been proven. Wyka states that poet's mother was the daughter of a noble (szlachta) family of Starykoń coat of arms, living on an estate at Czombrów in Nowogródek Voivodeship (Navahrudak Voivodeship).|$|E
5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem of evil which raises the problem that, if an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God exists, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil in the world would make the existence of God <b>improbable.</b> The theodicy attempts to demonstrate that the existence of God remains probable, despite the occurrence of evil.|$|E
5|$|The five reel {{film was}} {{released}} through the Pathé Exchange as a Pathé Gold Rooster Play on October 7, 1917. Charles E. Wagner of the Exhibitor's Trade Review {{found it to}} be a good film with great direction and photography, but was concerned that the stunt in which the baby appeared {{to be involved in the}} accident was too real. Wagner stated the film had sufficient action and pathos without sexual suggestiveness; which should prove a strong program for the Pathé program. Frances Agnew of The Morning Telegraph {{found it to be}} an average picture that was not exceptional for audiences, but it would hold sentimental appeal for the average viewer. A reviewer for The New York Dramatic Mirror found the film's excessive use of coincidental meetings to be highly <b>improbable,</b> but found Warde's performance to be excellent and the rest of the cast give good performances. The reviewer said that Emile Chautard had made the <b>improbable</b> story more plausible.|$|E
5|$|The only useful ways {{to reduce}} the spread of cold viruses are {{physical}} measures such as hand washing and face masks; in the healthcare environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also used. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. Vaccination has proved difficult as there are many viruses involved and they mutate rapidly. Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is, thus, highly <b>improbable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully {{investigate}} a series of deaths that occur immediately after an ancient artifact is brought to Boston from an excavation site in South America. According to Scully, the deaths {{appear to be the}} result of political terrorism, but Mulder suspects something more <b>improbable.</b>|$|E
5|$|These factors make eastern Pacific landfalls <b>improbable</b> {{north of}} about central Baja California. In those {{instances}} when upper level steering winds do allow a more northerly path, much cooler sea surface temperatures quickly weaken tropical cyclones that approach California, although torrential rainfall can still occur. For example, the September 24-hour rainfall record for Los Angeles {{is held by}} the 1939 Long Beach Tropical Storm, as of January 2007.|$|E
5|$|Under modern {{constitutional}} conventions, {{the sovereign}} acts {{on the advice}} of his or her ministers. Since these ministers most often enjoy the support of parliament and obtain the passage of bills, it is <b>improbable</b> that they would advise the sovereign to withhold assent. Hence, in modern practice, royal assent is always granted; a refusal to do so would be appropriate only in an emergency requiring the use of the monarch's reserve powers.|$|E
5|$|When a party {{calling itself}} Conservative {{can think of}} {{nothing better than to}} outbid the Government's {{election}} promises; when it demands economy in one breath and increased spending in the next; when it proposes an immediate tax cut regardless of inflationary results... when in short, the Conservative party no longer gives us a conservative alternative after twenty-one years... then our political system desperately requires an opposition prepared to stand for something more than the <b>improbable</b> chance of quick victory.|$|E
5|$|Appian {{claims that}} Lucullus had {{embarked}} from Rome {{with only a}} single legion; upon entering Anatolia to make war against Mithridates, he added four more legions to his army. The overall size of this force consisted of 30,000 infantry and 1,600 cavalry. Following Mithridates' retreat to Armenia, Appian estimates Lucullus' invading force to be only two legions and 500 horsemen, although it is highly <b>improbable</b> {{that he would have}} undertaken the invasion of Armenia with such a small army. Historian Adrian Sherwin-White places the size of Lucullus' force to 12,000 seasoned legionaries (composed of three legions), and 4,000 provincial cavalry and light infantry. The Roman army was further bolstered by several thousand allied Gallic, Thracian, and Bithynian infantry and cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} imagery, the {{asteroid}} belt is mostly empty. The asteroids are spread over such a large volume {{that it would be}} <b>improbable</b> to reach an asteroid without aiming carefully. Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known, and the total number ranges in the millions or more, depending on the lower size cutoff. Over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100km, and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that {{the asteroid belt}} has 0.7–1.7 million asteroids with a diameter of 1km or more. The apparent magnitudes of most of the known asteroids are 11–19, with the median at about 16.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{additional}} expense involved in re-shooting many {{portions of the}} film, Himanshu Rai replaced Najm-ul-Hassan with Ashok Kumar, who was the brother of Sashadhar Mukherjee's wife, as the hero of Jeevan Naiya. This marked the debut, <b>improbable</b> as it may seem, of Ashok Kumar's five-decade-long career in Hindi films. Najm-ul-Hassan was dismissed from his job at Bombay Talkies (this was {{the period in which}} actors and actresses were paid regular monthly salaries by one specific film studio and could not work in any other studio). His reputation as a dangerous cad established, he could not find work in any other studio. His career was ruined and he sank into obscurity.|$|E
5|$|In 1429, when Isabeau {{lived in}} English-occupied Paris, the {{accusation}} was again put forth that CharlesVII {{was not the}} son of CharlesVI. At that time, with two contenders for the French throne—the young HenryVI and disinherited Charles—this could have been propaganda {{to prop up the}} English claim. Furthermore, gossip spread that Joan of Arc was Isabeau and Orleans' illegitimate daughter—a rumor Gibbons finds <b>improbable</b> because Joan of Arc almost certainly was not born for some years after Orléans' assassination. Stories circulated that the dauphins were murdered, and attempts were made to poison the other children, all of which added to Isabeau's reputation of one of history's great villains.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, LeMond {{became the}} first non-European {{professional}} cyclist to win the Tour de France, and he remains the only American cyclist to have won the Tour. LeMond was accidentally shot with multiple pellets while hunting in 1987 and missed the next two Tours. He returned to the 1989 Tour, completing an <b>improbable</b> comeback by winning in dramatic fashion on the race's final stage. He successfully defended his title the following year, claiming his third and final Tour victory in 1990, which made LeMond one of only seven riders who have won three or more Tours. He retired from competition in December 1994. He {{was inducted into the}} United States Bicycling Hall of Fame in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Long epic poetry was not {{a popular}} genre in North Korea before Mt. Paektu, {{but it was in}} the Soviet Union where Cho had immigrated from. Poema and Mayakovsky's prosody and poetry were also among Cho's {{influences}} that can be seen in Mt. Paektu. These Russian stylistic influences gave Mt. Paektu its peculiar characteristics that prompted mixed reactions from the North Korean public. For instance, some in the literature circles were unfamiliar with the concept of a lyrical epic and thought of it as an <b>improbable</b> amalgam of genres, criticizing the work for being indistinguishable from ordinary prose. According to North Korean studies scholar Alzo David-West, the relatively favorable reaction to Mt. Paektu compared to some other literature testifies to North Korean readership being capable at being both a receptive and a dismissive audience.|$|E
5|$|Many doctors {{considered}} {{the case to}} be unusual and debated the cause of death. Some, including family members, accused them of criminal negligence; that Shepard was fed well before the operation, which could have allowed him to choke on vomit. No autopsy was made, but an inquest {{was made by the}} coroner. The two doctors to perform the operation made a statement on March 28, 1893 that after prior examinations no diseases were found and his heart and lungs seemed healthy. A Tribune reporter met doctor William J. Morton, son of possible ether discoverer William T. G. Morton who had first used it in 1846. Morton said it was most <b>improbable</b> Shepard died of ether, ensuring its safety when properly used, and that deaths were one in 25,000. He recommended an autopsy.|$|E
5|$|The report {{suggests}} two hypotheses for the accident. In the first, {{there was}} a flaw in the power control of the plane's engines, which would have kept one of the thrust levers into acceleration, regardless of their actual position. In such circumstances, there was mechanical failure of the aircraft. However, the occurrence of this failure is one in 400 billion hours of flight and therefore highly <b>improbable.</b> In the second hypothesis, the pilot has performed a procedure different from that provided in the manual, and put the thrust lever in an irregular position, a configuration of human error for the accident.|$|E
5|$|Although {{multiple}} hypotheses {{exist on}} the origins of the horse in Finland, an indigenous wild horse origin is thought <b>improbable,</b> as significant numbers of domesticated horses were imported from earliest times. The Finnhorse is most likely descended from a northern European domestic horse. One theory suggests that horses arrived from the west, brought to what today is western Finland by the Vikings during the Viking Age, circa 800–1050 CE. These Viking horses would have been of northern European ancestry. The other main theory suggests that non-Viking peoples, who migrated into Finland from the southeast and south, brought with them horses of Mongolian origin that had been further developed in the Urals and Volga River regions. Both theories have merit, as there were two distinct horse types in the eastern and western regions of Finland that remained distinct from one another until at least the middle of the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Both the Blazers and Mavericks started Game 4 {{with a quiet}} first half, with Dallas leading slightly. The Blazers then {{missed their}} first 15 shots after halftime as the Mavs' lead grew as big as 67–44. Roy then made a three-pointer {{near the end of}} the third to cut the lead to 67–49. In the fourth quarter, Roy scored 18 points after going 1-for-3 the {{previous}} 3 quarters, including a clutch 4-point play to tie the game and a bank shot from the middle of the paint with 49 seconds left to give his team the lead for good, finishing with 24 points to lead the Blazers to an <b>improbable</b> 84–82 win to tie the series. The Blazers would go on to lose the series in 6 games, but it gave hope for Roy to start again next season.|$|E
5|$|Checkmate is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Focusing {{on the subject of}} convictions by circumstantial evidence, the plot has a French baron and an American businessman vie for the affections of an heiress. She chooses the American and the French baron conspires with the heiress's aunt to take revenge. The American falls into their trap and is accused of stabbing the baron by the conspirators. The circumstantial evidence was enough to convict him and he is sent to prison. Through the aid of a homeless doppelgänger who looks like the fiancé, he is substituted in prison and the original forces a confession from the aunt. For his plot, the baron is convicted of perjury and sent to prison. Released on February 17, 1911, the film was a critical failure for its <b>improbable</b> plot and its prison substitution scene. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Despite some claims, {{such as that}} by the {{historian}} Max von Boehm, that the largest crinolines measured up to ten yards (30feet) around, the photohistorian Alison Gernsheim concluded that the maximum realistic circumference was in fact between five-and-a-half and six yards. Whilst a loosely gathered skirt draped over a large hoop would certainly require a higher yardage, Gernsheim noted that ten yard hems were highly <b>improbable.</b> Staged photographs showing women wearing exaggeratedly large crinolines were quite popular, such as a widely published sequence of five stereoscope views showing a woman dressing {{with the assistance of}} several maids who require long poles to lift her dress over her head and other ingenious means of navigating her enormous hoopskirt. Such photographs, which re-enacted contemporary caricatures rather than accurately reflecting reality, were aimed towards the voyeur's market. However, it was a fact that the size of the crinoline often caused difficulties in passing through doors, boarding carriages and generally moving about. By the late 1860s many crinolines were of a significantly reduced size, as noted by a Victoria and Albert Museum curator observing the sizes of cage crinolines in the Museum's collection.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in {{the year}} manager George Graham had started to {{assemble}} a squad with a blend of youth and experience. Having already signed defenders Steve Bould and Lee Dixon, he set about trimming the squad letting Steve Williams and Kenny Sansom leave. Arsenal were not considered favourites for the league title {{at the start of}} the season, but a 5–1 win away at Wimbledon on the opening day led to talk over their chances. They continued their fine start to the campaign, particularly away from home and led the table from the Christmas period. At one stage Arsenal were 11 points clear of Liverpool, but a series of draws and surprising defeats allowed the gap to be closed. By the time Arsenal faced Liverpool on the final day, they were faced with an <b>improbable</b> challenge – winning by a two-goal margin against the defending champions to claim the title. Graham's cautious approach paid dividends as Arsenal led after the break, and deep into stoppage time midfielder Michael Thomas scored the all-important second goal.|$|E
5|$|In response, Bangladesh lost Tamim Iqbal for a duck in {{the first}} over, giving debutant Ajmal Shahzad his first ODI wicket from his third ball of the match. Bresnan removed the other Bangladeshi opener in the 10th over, {{the first of his}} four wickets in the match. This wicket brought {{together}} Mushfiqur Rahim and Aftab Ahmed, who both played aggressively, putting on 56 together in the next ten overs, but when Aftab Ahmed was run out looking for a non-existent run, Bangladesh started to struggle. Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan both fell after making good starts and the required run rate started to rise, making a Bangladeshi victory look <b>improbable.</b> Slow scoring between Naeem Islam and Mahmudullah took victory further away, and Bangladesh eventually finished 45 runs short of their target, granting England a series whitewash.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Test of the 2009 Ashes at the SWALEC Stadium in Cardiff, Collingwood scored 64 {{in the first}} innings as England totalled 435. On a flat wicket, however, this was put into context by the Australians, who amassed 674 for 6 declared, with four centurions; Collingwood bowled nine overs, and claimed the wicket of Brad Haddin caught at deep midwicket. In reply, England slid to 70 for 5 and seemed certain to succumb to an innings defeat. In response, Collingwood stayed at the crease for 5¾ hours (nearly {{the whole of the}} final day) and top-scored for England with 74 runs from 245 balls. He was ninth man out, edging Peter Siddle to gully, but final pair James Anderson and Monty Panesar blocked out the final 11½ overs of the match to secure an <b>improbable</b> draw.|$|E
