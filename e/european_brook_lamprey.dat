5000|$|The {{brook lamprey}} (Lampetra planeri, {{also known as}} the <b>European</b> <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> and the western brook lamprey) is a small European lamprey species that {{exclusively}} inhabits freshwater environments. The species is related to, but distinct from, the North American western brook lamprey (Lampetra richardsoni).|$|E
5000|$|The {{southern}} <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> {{is currently}} {{listed as a}} species of “least concern” in the United States by CN Red List. The southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> has also not been given any status regarding endangerment by the US Federal List or CITES. Currently there are no conservation plans in action specific to the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> nor laws or protected waterways aimed at conservation. No evidence of biological factors {{has been found that}} would contribute to a decline in the abundance or the range of the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey,</b> in fact, the biggest threat to the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> and closely related species is human induced alteration of suitable microhabitats. In order to preserve these specific types of microhabitats used by the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> during each phase of the life cycle, habitat preservation and rehabilitation of affected microhabitats are essential. Microhabitats used by the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> during all life stages must have a certain water temperature, substrate composition, and water quality in order for the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> to successfully inhabit and spawn in these areas.|$|R
5000|$|The {{southern}} <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey's</b> {{life cycle}} {{consists of two}} main stages: larval and adult. During the larval stage, the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> inhabits a distinct micro habitat involving relatively slow moving water and a sandy substrate. The consistency of the substrate is vitally important to the Southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> because during the larval stage, the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> burrows into the substrate using its oral disk as an anchor. The southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> secretes mucus from its body to form a tube leading {{to the entrance of}} the burrow and to provide support for the burrow. The formation of this larval burrow relies on the composition and size of the substrate available. The combination of both small and large particles and coarse and fine sand grains allow the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> to construct a suitable burrow that allows enough water to flow through the burrow to ensure proper respiration. The substrate in which larval southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> burrow must not contain too many fine silt and clay particles as this would inhibit respiration while too many particles of coarse sand would hinder proper burrow construction. The larval stage is complete after approximately three years. Following the larval stage, the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form. Adult southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> are found in crevices and cracks between large rocks in deeper, faster moving water than the habitat occupied during the larval stage. After completing the metamorphosis to adults, southern <b>brook</b> <b>lampreys</b> come together in groups to spawn and, once spawning is complete, the adults die. Spawning usually occurs between April and May and takes place in another distinct microhabitat consisting of shallow riffle areas with rocky substrate with a water temperature falling between 17°C to 21°C. Fecundity of the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> averages between 800 and 2500 oocytes. Human factors have been found to influence the available habitat for spawning southern <b>brook</b> <b>lampreys.</b> Southern <b>brook</b> <b>lampreys</b> have been recorded using shallow areas under bridges as spawning grounds possibly to help conceal spawning aggregations from visual predators.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> {{occurs in}} slow moving {{rivers and streams}} from Florida to southern Mississippi, Georgia, and Arkansas along the Gulf Coast west to Oklahoma and Texas. The southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> ranges {{as far north as}} Minnesota and Wisconsin. Specifically, southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> have been reported to occur in the Chattahoochee river system and the Conecuh river system in Alabama, the Sabine river system in Texas and Louisiana, the Illinois river system in Oklahoma, and the Neches river system in Texas. The southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> was thought to be restricted to the southern United States; however, Becker observed southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> in Wisconsin in 1983. The southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> has also been reported to occur as far north as the Spruce river and the Tamarac river in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Unpublished findings have also shown that the southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> inhabits tributaries of Choctawhatchee Bay and the Ochlockonnee river system in Florida, the Chattahoochee river system in Georgia, and the Trinity and San Jacinto river systems in Texas.|$|R

50|$|The diet of the {{southern}} <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> changes as it undergoes metamorphosis during its life cycle from one phase to the next. The diet of larval southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> consists mainly of organic detritus. Studies that focused on closely related lamprey species (I. fossor) found that the stomach contents of larval lampreys contained 97.9% organic detritus, 2.12% algae, and 0.09% bacteria. After metamorphosis into the adult phase, southern <b>brook</b> <b>lampreys</b> do not feed but rely on stored fat reserves accumulated during the larval stage for energy and nutrients. Studies {{have found that the}} digestive tract of {{the southern}} <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> actually shrinks and becomes functionally useless as larval lampreys enter the adult stage. The southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> encounters a wide range of predators in its natural habitat. The eggs of adult lampreys are preyed on by various species of fish and crayfish. Southern <b>brook</b> <b>lampreys</b> in the larval stage serve as prey {{for a wide range of}} fish and bird species. Adult forms of the Southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> are preyed upon by larger fish species such as the Northern pike (E. lucius), perch species, the European chub (S. cephalus), and the mudpuppy (N. maculosus). The southern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> shares similar habitats and resources with many species of shiners (Notropis), the longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae), Johnny darters (Etheostoma nigrum), and mottled sculpins (Cottus bairdi).|$|R
50|$|Northern <b>brook</b> <b>lampreys</b> are jawless fishes, {{also known}} as cyclostomes. Northern <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> are {{considered}} non-parasitic lamprey. They have poorly developed teeth and a round, disc-like, subterminal mouth, called an oral-disc, for suction. Northern <b>brook</b> <b>lampreys</b> have a single dorsal fin that continues along their entire length until it connects with the caudal fin. This dorsal fin can be notched as well. Their coloration is gray-brown dorsally with a light line down the back and an even lighter ventral side. The length of adult northern <b>brook</b> <b>lampreys</b> does not typically exceed 16 cm and the body is attenuate. While the ammocoetes look similar to the adult lampreys the ammocoetes have a hooded mouth instead of an oral-disc and no eyes.|$|R
40|$|The least <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> has an eel-shaped {{body with}} a deeply notched dorsal fin which {{separates}} it into two distinct fins. The mouth is disc-shaped and surrounded by teeth. Adults are dark and tan above and lighter below. During spawning, adults become blue-black in color (dnr. state. oh. us.). The least <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> reaches a length of 18 cm and the maximum reported age is 8 years (fishbase. org) Behavior The least <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> is a non-parasitic species that spawns in late winter or spring. The eggs hatch in 3 - 4 weeks and the larval stage lasts about 5 - 6 years. Larvae metamorphose in late summer. Adults over-winter, spawn, and then die. The brood is hidden in nests in gravely riffles and the eggs are not guarded (natureserve. org).

40|$|The 3 lamprey species, {{sea lamprey}} Petromyzon marinus L., European river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis L. and <b>European</b> <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> L. planeri Bloch, that inhabit the Iberian Peninsula are of {{conservation}} concern. They are considered either Vulnerable, Critically Endangered, and even Extinct in {{different regions of}} this area mainly due to habitat loss and population fragmentation. Although several other factors contribute to the decline of lamprey populations in Iberian rivers, obstacles to migration (dams and weirs) {{are probably the most}} widespread and significant, causing an estimated 80 % loss of accessible habitat in most river basins. We analysed historical records from all main Iberian rivers before the construction of impassable dams became widespread, and found that lampreys were consistently present in the upper reaches. The un - blocking of the lower stretches of major river basins and the restoration of former spawning sites and larval habitats should be considered as priority measures for the conservation of these species. Identification of Special Areas of Conservation {{to be included in the}} Natura 2000 European network can also be very relevant for lamprey conservation...|$|E
40|$|The European river lamprey, Lampetra fluviatilis (L.), and the <b>European</b> <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey,</b> Lampetra planeri (Bloch, 1784), are {{considered}} highly threatened in Portugal. However, {{the lack of}} information about the ecology and distribution of these species poses difficulties to the identification of concrete actions directed to their conservation. A total of 401 sampling sites, randomly distributed throughout the entire Portuguese mainland territory were selected, and Lampetra sp. ammocoetes presence or absence checked with electrofishing. These data, together with 11 macrohabitat predictors, were analyzed using Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs). The BRT models consistently identified five environmental variables as the most important for predicting the distribution of European brook and river lamprey ammocoetes: altitude, distance to coast, sand, maximum temperature of the warmest month and precipitation of the driest month. The relationships of these variables with the species probability of occurrence suggest that lampreys occur in low altitude river stretches ( 70 % sand). In addition, intermediate values of temperature and precipitation were also found to have a positive correlation with the species occurrence. A map with the probability of occurrence of Lampetra sp. in Portugal was generated and stretches of rivers were delimited with different conservation priorities. Rivers classified with the highest level of conservation priority were considered to be proposed as Special Areas of Conservation, under the Natura 2000 Networking Programme...|$|E
40|$|Jawless {{vertebrates}} are pivotal representatives {{for studies}} {{of the evolution of}} adaptive immunity due to their unique position in chordate phylogeny. Lamprey and hagfish, the extant jawless vertebrates, have an alternative lymphocyte-based adaptive immune system that is based on somatically diversifying leucine-rich repeat (LRR) -based antigen receptors, termed variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs). Lamprey T-like and B-like lymphocyte lineages have been shown to express VLRA and VLRB types of anticipatory receptors, respectively. An additional VLR type, termed VLRC, has recently been identified in arctic lamprey (Lethenteron camtschaticum), and our analysis indicates that VLRC sequences are well conserved in sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), L. camtschaticum, and <b>European</b> <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> (Lampetra planeri). Genome sequences of P. marinus were analyzed to determine the organization of the VLRC-encoding locus. In addition to the incomplete germ-line VLRC gene, we have identified 182 flanking donor genomic sequences {{that could be used to}} complete the assembly of mature VLRC genes. Donor LRR cassettes were classifiable into five basic structural groups, the composition of which determines their order of use during VLRC assembly by virtue of sequence similarities to the incomplete germ-line gene and to one another. Bidirectional VLRC assembly was predicted by comparisons of mature VLRC genes with the sequences of donor LRR cassettes and verified by analysis of partially assembled intermediates. Biased and repetitive use of certain donor LRR cassettes was demonstrable in mature VLRCs. Our analysis provides insight into the unique molecular strategies used for VLRC gene assembly and repertoire diversification...|$|E

40|$|The {{tendency}} of many species to abandon migration remains a poorly understood aspect of evolutionary biology that may {{play an important}} role in promoting species radiation by both allopatric and sympatric mechanisms. Anadromy inherently offers an opportunity for the colonisation of freshwater environments, and the shift from an anadromous to a wholly-freshwater life-history has occurred in many families of fishes. Freshwater-resident forms have arisen repeatedly among lampreys (within the Petromyzontidae and Mordaciidae), and there has been much debate as to whether anadromous lampreys, and their derived freshwater-resident analogues, constitute distinct species or are divergent ecotypes of polymorphic species. Samples of 543 European river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis (mostly from anadromous populations) and freshwater <b>European</b> <b>brook</b> <b>lamprey</b> L. planeri from across 18 sites, primarily in the British Isles, were investigated for 13 polymorphic microsatellite DNA loci, and 108 samples from six of these sites were sequenced for 829 bp of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). We found contrasting patterns of population structure for mtDNA and microsatellite DNA markers, such that low diversity and little structure were seen for all populations for mtDNA (consistent with a recent founder expansion event), while fine-scale structuring was evident for nuclear markers. Strong differentiation for microsatellite DNA loci was seen among freshwater-resident L. planeri populations and between L. fluviatilis and L. planeri in most cases, but little structure was evident among anadromous L. fluviatilis populations. We conclude that post-glacial colonisation founded multiple freshwater-resident populations with strong habitat fidelity and limited dispersal tendencies, that became highly differentiated, a pattern that was likely intensified by anthropogenic barriers...|$|E
40|$|The Water Framework Directive, {{adopted in}} the year 2000, {{promotes}} {{a new approach to}} water management through river basin planning, fundamentally by placing aquatic ecology at the base of management decisions. The Directive commits EU member states to achieve at least 'good' qualitative status of all water bodies by 2015. A fundamental paradigm of stream ecology is the way that lotic communities change according to environmental conditions along the longitudinal gradient of a river system. The aim {{of the present study was}} to conduct an Environmental Assessment of Ell Brook, Gloucestershire, by considering the approaches taken to quantify the relationship between nutrient conditions and biological quality for four riverine biological elements outlined in Annex V of the Water Framework Directive; macroinvertebrates, phytobenthos, macrophytes, and fish. Ell Brook is a tributary of the River Leadon. The catchment area is predominantly rural and low-lying, with steeper topography at the margins. Arable farming predominates the landscape. The target for this waterbody is to achieve Good Ecological Status by 2027. The Ell Brook is failing to meet 'good' status due to a classification of moderate for phosphate and macroinvertebrates in 2009. The classification is based on two routine monitoring stations which are located in the lower reaches of the catchment Four locations were assessed for macroinvertebrate faunal assemblages along the Ell Brook. Water samples were collected and analysed at seven different locations along the watercourse and at two tributaries to assess the water quality. Peacocks Brook was chosen to represent the urban influence to the Ell Brook and Oakelbrook Mill represents the effect of the poly-tunnels in the north of the catchment. Fish population, macrophyte and diatom assessments were carried out at two locations, Oxenhall and Brass Mill to assess the potential impact that Newent Sewage Treatment Works (STW) is having on the different Biological Quality Elements (BQEs). Water quality shows to be above the threshold for phosphorus at all sample locations, with a noted increase after the STW discharge point. Macroinvertebrate samples showed to be improving at the two routine monitoring sites. Diatom taxa typical of eutrophic conditions dominated both samples, including those upstream of Newent STW discharge. A slight change in diatom flora was observed at the downstream location, with an increase of motile taxa with a tolerance to both pollution and phosphates. Macrophyte samples generated classifications of 'moderate' to 'poor' for three locations along the brook. Fish population surveys showed the presence of bullheads (Cottus gobio), brown trout (Salmo trutta) and <b>European</b> <b>Brook</b> <b>Lamprey</b> (Lampetra planeri) however the young of year age cohort of brown trout at the upstream location suggests that larger trout may not be able to utilise habitat in the upper and middle reaches of Ell Brook...|$|E
