A serious problem related to the transmission of blood-borne viruses is the thorough removal of organic matter, and mainly blood, from <b>dental</b> <b>instruments</b> when performing manual pre-sterilization decontamination. Application of benzidine test to prove the presence of blood traces on large and small <b>dental</b> <b>instruments</b> prepared for sterilization for the purpose of assessing the quality of the manual pre-sterilization decontamination. A total of 485 benzidine tests had been performed on selected 205 large and 280 small <b>dental</b> <b>instruments</b> visibly contaminated with blood. Of the total of 485 tested samples, blood traces were found in 63 (12. 99 ± 1. 53 %). In the group of large instruments, positive benzidine test was obtained in 7. 80 % compared to 16. 78 % in the small instruments with the difference being statistically significant (p = 0. 003). All 63 positive samples were additionally processed using ultrasound. Blood traces were found in 8 instruments with all of the positive samples being obtained from the barbed broaches. The manual cleaning does not guarantee decontamination of the <b>dental</b> <b>instruments</b> unlike the ultrasonic cleaning where any blood traces are being completely removed from the large instruments. In terms of the small instruments, there are still blood traces present after the ultrasonic cleaning which requires for it to be combined with a suitable enzyme cleaner, and the barbed broaches, as a requirement, should be used on a disposable basis...|$|R

40|$|Background. Dentures and <b>dental</b> <b>instruments</b> are {{frequently}} encountered ingested foreign bodies. The {{aim of the}} present study was to assess the safety and efficacy of endoscopically removing ingested dental objects. Methods. Twenty-nine consecutive patients with 29 dental objects who were treated at the Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital from August 2009 to December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Characteristics of the patients and the ingested dental objects, the clinical features and findings of radiological imaging tests, and outcomes of endoscopic removal were analyzed. Results. Patients’ mean age was 62. 9 ± 21. 0 years. The ingested dental objects included 23 dentures (13 crowns, 4 bridges, 4 partial dentures, and 2 other dentures) and 6 <b>dental</b> <b>instruments.</b> Twenty-seven upper gastrointestinal endoscopies and 2 colonoscopies were performed, and their success rates were 92. 6 % and 100 %, respectively. There were 2 cases of removal failure; one case involved an impacted partial denture in the cervical esophagus, and this case required surgical removal. Conclusions. Endoscopic removal of ingested dentures and <b>dental</b> <b>instruments</b> is associated with a favorable success rate and acceptable complications. The immediate intervention and appropriate selection of devices are essential for managing ingested dental objects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{efficiency}} of a decontamination procedure by sonication for different den-tal instruments after experimental microbial and viral contamination was tested. Both ger-micidal and virucidal activity of sonication {{in the presence}} or absence of a cationic bio-biguanid disinfectant was assessed following three different disinfection/sterilisation pro-tocols. <b>Dental</b> <b>instruments</b> were contaminated with a mixed culture of Enterococcus fae-cium, Staphylococcus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium sp., Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, or with Poliovirus type 1 and Herpesvirus simplex type 1 (HHV- 1), exposed to ultrasonic treatment in an ultrasonic bath and the surviving microorgan-isms titered. The results showed that an effective disinfection of <b>dental</b> <b>instruments,</b> expressed by an equal or higher than 4 logs microbial and viral reduction, can be obtained after 15 min or 10 min sonication in an ultrasonic cleaner equipped with a Sweep System Technology. Conversely, by the combined action of chemical disinfection and ultrasonic treatment in the same device, a sterilising effect was obtained after only 5 min for microbial and 10 - 15 min for virally contaminated instruments. The synergistic effect of chemical and physical means, as already accepted as an effective cleaning pro-cedure of medical instruments, can therefore be applied to obtain a safe and effective sterilisation of <b>dental</b> <b>instruments</b> potentially contaminated by organic fluids and dental material harbouring pathogenic microbes and viruses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background A {{fracture}} of root canal instruments, with a fractured piece protruding beyond the apex, is a troublesome incident during an endodontic treatment. Locating and retrieving them represents {{a challenge to}} maxillofacial surgeons because {{it is difficult to}} access due to the proximity between the foreign body and vital structures. Although safe and accurate for surgery, radiographs and electromagnetic devices do not provide a precise three-dimensional position. In contrast, computer-aided navigation provides a correlation between preoperatively collected data and intraoperatively encountered anatomy. However, using a navigation system for mandible treatment is difficult as the mobile nature of the mandible complicates its synchronization with the preoperative imaging data during surgery. Case presentation This report describes a case of a <b>dental</b> <b>instrument</b> breakage in the mandible during an endodontic treatment for a restorative dental procedure in a 65 -year-old Japanese woman. The broken <b>dental</b> <b>instrument</b> was removed using a minimally invasive approach with a surgical navigation system and an interocclusal splint for a stable, identically repeatable positioning of the mandible. Using the three-dimensional position of the navigation probe, a location that best approximated the most anterior extent of the fragment was selected. A minimally invasive vestibular incision was made at this location, a subperiosteal reflection was performed, and the foreign body location was confirmed using a careful navigation system. The instrument was carefully visualized and extruded from the apical to the tooth crown side and was then removed using mosquito forceps through the medullary cavity of the crown side of the tooth. Follow-up was uneventful; her clinical course was good. Conclusions The use of a surgical navigation system together with an interocclusal splint enabled the retrieval of a broken <b>dental</b> <b>instrument</b> in a safe and minimally invasive manner without damaging the surrounding vital structures...|$|E

40|$|Objective Foreign body {{aspiration}} is {{a possible}} complication of dental treatment that {{may result in a}} life-threatening situation. The foreign body is often spontaneously ejected from the airway, but in other cases, surgical intervention is needed. Prevention, diagnostic procedures, treatment and complications are discussed. Materials and methods Three cases of aspiration of <b>dental</b> <b>instruments</b> are described: the piece was localised in the right main bronchus in two cases and in the left main bronchus in one case. Results All three cases underwent surgery (resection and bronchoscopy); in one case, the surgical attempt failed, and the foreign body was not located by radiography; it was assumed to have been expelled spontaneously. Conclusion The management of <b>dental</b> materials and <b>instruments</b> requires particular care, especially if the patient is supine or semi-recumbent. The dentist must be able to manage emergency situations in which patients accidentally inspire or swallow <b>dental</b> <b>instruments</b> or materials during treatment.
