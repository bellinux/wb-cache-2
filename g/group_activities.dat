5|$|During {{this time}} Sudirman also {{continued}} {{to serve as}} a member of the Muhammadiyah Youth Group. Within the group he was known as a keen negotiator and mediator, working to resolve issues between members; he also preached at the local mosque. He was elected as Chair of the Banyumas District of the Muhammadiyah Youth Group at the end of 1937. In this role he enacted policies facilitating members' studies and activities, both religious and secular. He was later put in charge of Youth <b>Group</b> <b>activities</b> throughout Central Java and spent much of his free time travelling and preaching Islam, putting an emphasis on self-awareness. Alfiah was also active in Muhammadiyah-sponsored activities through the group's branch for women, Nasyiatul Aisyiyah.|$|E

40|$|Blood <b>group</b> <b>activity</b> was {{proven to}} be a {{property}} of the bacterium per se which possesses it, although such activity was influenced by the cultural environment of the organism. High concentrations of peptones having blood <b>group</b> <b>activity</b> were able to transfer this activity to inactive organisms; however, the conferred activity was proportional to the concentration. As a result of the low concentrations, the blood <b>group</b> <b>activity</b> of peptones was eliminated upon incorporation in culture media, and the activity of the peptones had no effect on the blood <b>group</b> <b>activity</b> levels of microorganisms when grown in these media. Conversely, the vitamin content of culture media did affect blood group active organisms. Multiple vitamins in media decreased the activity levels by blocking the reactive sites of the active organisms on which activity detection depended. Blood <b>group</b> <b>activity</b> levels were highest in media of minimal or no vitamin content. Therefore, it can be concluded that a choice of cultural medium becomes an important factor in the quantitation of bacterial blood <b>group</b> <b>activity...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{giant otter}} is an {{especially}} noisy animal, with a complex repertoire of vocalizations. All otters produce vocalizations, but by frequency and volume, the giant otter {{may be the most}} vocal. Duplaix identified nine distinct sounds, with further subdivisions possible, depending on context. Quick hah barks or explosive snorts suggest immediate interest and possible danger. A wavering scream may be used in bluff charges against intruders, while a low growl is used for aggressive warning. Hums and coos are more reassuring within the group. Whistles may be used as advance warning of nonhostile intent between groups, although evidence is limited. Newborn pups squeak to elicit attention, while older young whine and wail when they begin to participate in <b>group</b> <b>activities.</b> An analysis published in 2014 cataloged 22 distinct types of vocalization in adults and 11 in neonates.|$|E
5|$|After the United Kingdom's {{entry into}} World War I in 1914, Wheeler {{volunteered for the}} armed forces. Although preferring solitary to <b>group</b> <b>activities,</b> Wheeler found that he greatly enjoyed soldiering. For the next seven months, he was posted as an {{instructor}} in the University of London Officer Training Corps. It was during this period, in January 1915, that a son was born to the Wheelers, and named Michael. Michael was their only child, something that was a social anomaly at the time, although it is unknown if this was by choice or not. In May 1915, Wheeler transferred to the Royal Field Artillery (Territorial Force) and shortly thereafter was appointed captain. In this position he was stationed at various bases across Britain, often bringing {{his wife and child}} with him; his responsibility was as a battery commander, initially of field guns and later of howitzers.|$|E

25|$|A small 2004 {{study by}} Ellen Paek empirically {{examined}} {{the extent to}} which religiosity, operationalized as religious orientation and religious behavior, is related to the controversial idea of emotional intelligence (EI). The study examined {{the extent to which}} religious orientation and behavior were related to self-reported EI in 148 church attending adult Christians. Non-religious individuals were not part of the study. The study found that the individuals' self-reported religious orientation was positively correlated with their perceiving themselves to have greater EI. While the number of religious <b>group</b> <b>activities</b> was positively associated with perceived EI, number of years of church attendance was unrelated. Significant positive correlations were also found between level of religious commitment and perceived EI. Thus, the Christian volunteers were more likely to consider themselves emotionally intelligent if they spent more time in <b>group</b> <b>activities</b> and had more commitment to their beliefs.|$|E

25|$|The midday {{rest period}} is an {{important}} time for establishing and reinforcing relationships within the group. Mutual grooming reinforces social bonds, and helps keep hair free from dirt and parasites. It is not as common among gorillas as in other primates, although females groom their offspring regularly. Young gorillas play often and are more arboreal than the large adults. Playing helps them learn how to communicate and behave within the <b>group.</b> <b>Activities</b> include wrestling, chasing, and somersaults.

25|$|A 2008 {{study of}} 227 {{undergraduate}} and graduate students enrolled in web-enabled courses at the Naval War College (NWC) and a public university found that social loafing not only exists, but may also be prevalent in the online learning classroom. Although only 2% of NWC and 8% of public university students self-reported social loafing, 8% of NWC and 77% of public university students indicated the perception of others engaging in social loafing. Additional findings generally verify face-to-face social loafing findings from previous studies. The researchers conclude that injustice {{in the distribution of}} rewards increases social loafing, and suggest that self-perceived dominance negatively affects individual participation in <b>group</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Seoul Central District Court {{granted the}} three members a {{temporary}} contract injunction in October 2009 {{and stated that}} S.M. Entertainment could not interfere with their individual activities, thus placing a halt on TVXQ's <b>group</b> <b>activities</b> in South Korea. The members claimed that the contract was unfair and they were left out of proper profit distribution. In response, S.M. Entertainment called a press conference and claimed that the lawsuit was not about unfair contracts or human rights, but motivated by the three members' greed to pursue their cosmetics business uninhibited by the restrictions of their exclusive contract with S.M. Entertainment. The agency submitted a complaint on criminal misdemeanor charges against the cosmetics company CreBeau; however, it was never brought to court by the prosecutor on grounds of insufficient evidence. The three replied that they hoped S.M. Entertainment would respect the court's decision.|$|E
25|$|The Hawaiians’ ways of {{learning}} include wide keen {{attention from the}} children while adults are available for guidance, {{also found in the}} model of Learning by Observing and Pitching In. Children were found to learn from adults by participating in <b>group</b> <b>activities</b> where they had the chance to observe the performance of more experienced participants as well as having errors in their own performance corrected by more seasoned group members. Because the children learn through observation, and then are encouraged to practice among their peers, we can speculate the children have keen attention to events around them, which is an expectation of adults and community members who are there to assist when needed. It has been observed that Hawaiian children were successful at completing tasks which greatly depend on visual and memory process skills, which coincides with Hawaiian mother’s frequent use of non-verbal communication.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of the successes of the pilot, the {{programme}} began scale-up in 2004 and plans are in place to open an additional 1500 methadone maintenance treatment clinics for about 300,000 heroin users by 2008. A National Training Center for methadone maintenance treatment has been established in Yunnan to provide clinical and technical support. The services offered at such clinics have been broadened and provide access to other services, including HIV and hepatitis testing, antiretroviral therapy for eligible AIDS patients, <b>group</b> <b>activities,</b> and skills training for employment. The use of methadone maintenance therapy has been incorporated into the AIDS Regulations as a treatment for heroin addiction. Additionally, the requirements for entrance into methadone maintenance treatment programmes have been relaxed to encourage greater access. For example, patients are no longer required to have local residency or a previous history of internment in a detoxification centre. The programme is not without problems, however, and retaining drug users in the programme remains a critical challenge.|$|E
