5|$|Enamel's {{primary mineral}} is hydroxyapatite, {{which is a}} {{crystalline}} calcium phosphate. The large amount of minerals in enamel accounts {{not only for its}} strength but also for its brittleness. Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. Unlike dentin and bone, enamel does not contain collagen. Proteins of note <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> enamel are ameloblastins, amelogenins, enamelins and tuftelins. It is believed that they aid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> enamel by serving as framework support, among other functions.|$|E

Heterosexual arousal during childhood had a very small effect on adult sexual preference. Homosexual women were more likely to have their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, did not appear to play a significant role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant.
