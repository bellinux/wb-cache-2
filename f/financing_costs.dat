5|$|The American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, {{shortly after}} its March 1899 formation, placed orders {{for its first}} four ships for the company's planned sugar service between Hawaii and the East Coast of the United States. Three ships—American, , and —were ordered from Delaware River Shipbuilding in Chester, Pennsylvania, while the fourth——was ordered from Union Iron Works of San Francisco. The {{contract}} cost of the three Pennsylvania-built ships was set at $425,000 each, but <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> drove the final cost of each ship higher; the final cost of American was $61.00 per deadweight ton, which totaled just under $540,000.|$|E
5|$|In May 1912, the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company {{placed an}} order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for two new cargo ships— and Ohioan. The {{contract}} {{cost of the}} ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, but with a maximum price of $640,000 per ship. Maryland Steel financed the construction with a credit plan which called for a 5% down payment in cash followed by nine monthly installments for the balance. The deal allowed {{for some of the}} nine installments to be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages. The final cost of Ohioan, including <b>financing</b> <b>costs,</b> was $73.58 per deadweight ton, which came out to just under $730,000.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter of 1909, American-Hawaiian, looking to expand its fleet, placed an order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for three new cargo ships—Kentuckian, Georgian, and Honolulan. The {{contract}} for the ships required that American-Hawaiian pay $1,000,000 in cash and a further $650,000 in twelve monthly notes at 5% interest. Provisions of the deal allowed that the monthly notes could be converted into longer-term mortgages at 6% interest, and secured by the ships themselves. The final cost of Kentuckian, including <b>financing</b> <b>costs,</b> was $58.33 per deadweight ton, which came out to just under $579,000.|$|E

25|$|Private {{funding for}} such a complex {{infrastructure}} project was of unprecedented scale. An initial equity of £45million was raised by CTG/F-M, increased by £206million private institutional placement, £770million {{was raised in a}} public share offer that included press and television advertisements, a syndicated bank loan and letter of credit arranged £5billion. Privately financed, the total investment costs at 1985 prices were £2.6billion. At the 1994 completion actual costs were, in 1985 prices, £4.65billion: an 80% cost overrun. The cost overrun was partly due to enhanced safety, security, and environmental demands. <b>Financing</b> <b>costs</b> were 140% higher than forecast.|$|E
25|$|This {{is due in}} part to the {{reduction}} in the costs of COE and PARF between 2000 and 2005, which has incentivised owners to purchase new cars before their ten years is up. Previously, the COE and PARF represented around 80% of the cost of a medium-priced car like the Honda Accord. With the COE and PARF less expensive than in the past, in some cases the yearly drop in the COE and PARF rebate becomes significant compared to the pre-tax (OMV) price of a new car. Furthermore, with the PARF rebate starting to diminish after a car is five years old, the net amount of credit (similar to resale value or trade-in value) compared to the OMV becomes less favourable for owners of older cars. In contrast, in countries with low taxes, the most economical ownership strategy is to keep a car as long as possible until repair costs exceed a new car's depreciation costs or <b>financing</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E

500|$|In recent years, PV {{technology}} has improved its electricity generating efficiency, reduced the installation cost per watt {{as well as}} its energy payback time (EPBT), and has reached grid parity in at least 19 different markets by 2014. Photovoltaics is increasingly becoming a viable source of mainstream power. However, prices for PV systems show strong regional variations, much more than solar cells and panels, which tend to be global commodities. In 2013, utility-scale system prices in highly penetrated markets such as China and Germany were significantly lower ($1.40/W) than in the United States ($3.30/W). The IEA explains these discrepancies due to differences in [...] "soft costs", which include customer acquisition, permitting, inspection and interconnection, installation labor and <b>financing</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E
40|$|Management of {{accounting}} exposure is {{often at the}} expense of increased transaction exposure or increased <b>financing</b> <b>cost.</b> Multinational firms want to mitigate both foreign exchange exposures and also reduce <b>financing</b> <b>cost.</b> This paper develops a model to demonstrate the potential for a comprehensive strategy which will mitigate accounting exposure without increasing transaction exposure or <b>financing</b> <b>cost.</b> The model has three main participants: multinational firms (as borrowers and business corporations), Asian-Pacific nations (as host countries), and their National Provident Funds (as lenders). The strategy involves direct local currency borrowing from National Provident Funds for multinational firms' investments in Asian-Pacific countries and the use of local currency sales revenue for servicing the debt. The strategy outlined satisfies the preferences of all the participants involved. The primary purpose of the paper is to provide a conceptual exposition of the potential, under certain conditions...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{propose a}} dynamic {{hierarchical}} linear model (DHLM) {{to study the}} variations in the <b>costs</b> of trade <b>finance</b> across multiple countries during the global financial crisis of 2008 - 2009.

2500|$|One {{variant of}} selling short {{involves}} a long position. [...] "Selling short against the box" [...] consists of holding a long position {{on which the}} shares have already risen, whereupon one then enters a short sell order for {{an equal number of}} shares. The term box alludes to the days when a safe deposit box was used to store (long) shares. [...] The purpose of this technique is to lock in paper profits on the long position without having to sell that position (and possibly incur taxes if said position has appreciated). Once the short position has been entered, it serves to balance the long position taken earlier. Thus, from that point in time, the profit is locked in (less brokerage fees and short <b>financing</b> <b>costs),</b> regardless of further fluctuations in the underlying share price. For example, one can ensure a profit in this way, while delaying sale until the subsequent tax year.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2005, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, {{charged with}} {{ensuring}} {{value for money}} in public spending, published a report concluding that it was [...] "impossible to determine" [...] whether the PPP was better value than a publicly run investment programme, {{primarily because of the}} untested periodic review structure of the 30-year contracts. These were to be revised every 7.5 years, meaning that the ultimate price for the promised £15.7 billion of investment was still unknown. It noted that using public bond finance would have saved £90 million a year in <b>financing</b> <b>costs,</b> even though the Government guaranteed repayment of 95% of costs in the event of premature termination, and the contracts placed limits and exemptions on financial risk transferred to the infrastructure companies. The system still received an annual public subsidy of £1 billion, but its spending was now determined entirely by the infracos' interpretation of their 2000-page PPP contracts. Although the private operators were expected to receive at least 18–20% returns on capital (for Metronet), for the type of risk associated with major upgrades, most of the work was low-risk maintenance and replacement. The public-sector procurement option (using private companies for specific major projects) would also have saved the £455 million cost of concluding the PPP contracts, not to mention the five years' delay the contract negotiations caused.|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, the {{complaint}} {{has been made}} that agencies have too much power over issuers and that downgrades can even force troubled companies into bankruptcy. The lowering of a credit score by a CRA can create a vicious cycle and a self-fulfilling prophecy: not only do interest rates on securities rise, but other contracts with financial institutions may also be affected adversely, causing an increase in <b>financing</b> <b>costs</b> and an ensuing decrease in creditworthiness. Large loans to companies often contain a clause that makes the loan due in full if the company's credit rating is lowered beyond a certain point (usually from investment grade to [...] "speculative"). The purpose of these [...] "ratings triggers" [...] {{is to ensure that}} the loan-making bank is able to lay claim to a weak company's assets before the company declares bankruptcy and a receiver is appointed to divide up the claims against the company. The effect of such ratings triggers, however, can be devastating: under a worst-case scenario, once the company's debt is downgraded by a CRA, the company's loans become due in full; if the company is incapable of paying all of these loans in full at once, it is forced into bankruptcy (a so-called death spiral). These ratings triggers were instrumental in the collapse of Enron. Since that time, major agencies have put extra effort into detecting them and discouraging their use, and the US SEC requires that public companies in the United States disclose their existence.|$|E
