40|$|<b>Garnishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> {{as a way}} for {{creditors}} {{to enforce}} payment by unwilling or insolvent debtors, while very common in Germany and Switzerland, is not very successful. Based on a dynamic model of debtor behaviour, this paper explores two alternatives of reform. One is to reduce the rate <b>of</b> <b>garnishment,</b> which at present amounts to 100 percent <b>of</b> the <b>wage</b> income exceeding a defined subsistence level, thus probably destroying incentives to work. According to model simulations, reducing the rate <b>of</b> <b>garnishment</b> is likely to result in an increase of labour supply but a decrease <b>of</b> <b>garnishment</b> revenue per period. Second, the introduction of a debt release as it exists in the United States would have an ambiguous effect on labour supply. While providing debtors with a fresh start, it would result a partial loss for creditors. A Pareto improvement thus {{does not seem to be}} possible. When taxpayers as an involved third party are taken into account, however, a potential Pareto improvement appears attainable through debt release...|$|R

McDermott claimed he had [...] "traveled back in time and killed Hitler and the last 6 Nazis." [...] However, the prosecution asserted that the killings were motivated by his employer's <b>garnishment</b> <b>of</b> his <b>wages</b> for the IRS, to pay child support taxes that he owed.|$|R
50|$|Creditors' {{rights are}} the {{procedural}} provisions {{designed to protect}} the ability of creditors—persons who are owed money—to collect the money that they are owed. These provisions vary from one jurisdiction to another, and may include the ability of a creditor to put a lien on a debtor's property, to effect a seizure and forced sale of the debtor's property, to effect a <b>garnishment</b> <b>of</b> the debtor's <b>wages,</b> and to have certain purchases or gifts made by the debtor set aside as fraudulent conveyances. The rights of a particular creditor usually depend in part on the reason for which the debt is owed, and the terms of any writing memorializing the debt.|$|R

A Sheriff or deputy {{may be required to}} attend all court sessions; to act as bailiff; to take charge of juries whenever they are outside the courtroom and to extradite prisoners. Today's Sheriffs, like their historical counterparts, also carry out such unenviable but necessary court-related functions as serving subpoenas, summonses, warrants, writs or civil process; enforcing money decrees (such as those relating to child support payments, <b>garnishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> or sale of property); and collecting taxes.|$|E
50|$|Farabee {{sponsored}} {{a constitutional amendment}} to allow <b>garnishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> for child support. He secured passage of a bill allowing state agencies to maintain daycare facilities on the premises for the employees. He worked for modernization of juvenile justice policies to guarantee due process and the prevention of young persons from being housed in adult facilities. He attempted to prevent outside groups from dominating state textbook selection through the 15-member elected Texas State Board of Education. He opposed the state's blue laws and advocated industrial development and urban renewal. He sponsored legislation referring to HIV and AIDS cases. He supported the first limitation in Texas on medical malpractice. He worked to accelerate the time that a criminal case reaches the appeal stage.|$|E
50|$|As to the {{question}} of whether or not the Court should exercise the power vested in it by section 98(5) of the Constitution, so as to enable the legislature to devise an adequate substitute for the imprisonment option, it was held that it was by no means so that the system was dependent upon the imprisonment sanction for its viability. There were a number of other aids to judgment-debt collection in the system: for example, property attachment and <b>garnishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages.</b> In any event, the system was so clearly inconsistent with the right to freedom protected by section 11(1) of the Constitution, and so manifestly indefensible under section 33(1) of the Constitution, that there was no warrant for its retention, even temporarily.|$|E
5000|$|Generally, a {{creditor}} who {{has obtained}} a monetary judgment (a ruling from a court under which another party {{is required to}} pay money to the creditor) may enforce this judgment through the seizure and forced sale of the debtor's property, through the seizure of money held in the debtor's bank accounts, and through <b>garnishment</b> <b>of</b> the debtor's <b>wages.</b> In each instance, however, the creditor is required {{to engage in a}} [...] "public act", such as the recording of a lien on the title to the debtor's real estate to be seized, or using other public notice to place a lien on debtor's personal property. Thus, the required public act fixes a lien on the debtor's property. Not only does this establish the rights of the creditor to seize and sell the property, it also determines what priority the creditor will have against other creditors who may wish to seize the same property.|$|R
50|$|A levy in {{the form}} <b>of</b> <b>garnishment</b> upon <b>wages</b> is {{considered}} to be a continuous levy, i.e. it needs to be applied only once and will be applicable to future wages until either released by the IRS under §6343 or the debt is fully paid. So as future wages are earned, no additional levy action is necessary by the IRS to take a large portion from them. Distinguish this from a bank account levy. Once the money in the bank account has been sent by the bank to the IRS, any future deposits can only be reached with additional levy action by the IRS.|$|R

50|$|If payors fail {{to comply}} with {{maintenance}} payments, the FMEP will issue administrative enforcement as well as court enforcement to ensure collection of unpaid maintenance. Administrative enforcement actions include Notices of Attachment, which require the <b>garnishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> and other sources of income or the interception of federal payments (such as employment insurance benefits and income tax returns), reporting arrears to the credit bureau, refusing to issue or renew a payor’s driver’s license, and placing a lien on a payor's land or personal property. Court enforcement mechanisms involve requiring a payor to attend in court to explain the non-payment of maintenance and, ultimately, incarceration for the willful failure to pay court ordered maintenance. Cases are assessed individually {{in order to determine}} which type of enforcement is appropriate. This decision depends on factors such as the payor’s history and the amount of money owed. Under section 11.1 of the Act, the FMEP has the authority to charge payors interest on late and unpaid maintenance. This interest goes to the recipient.|$|E
50|$|The American Emigrant Company (AEC) was {{established}} in 1864 {{to take advantage of}} the “act to encourage immigration” passed by Congress that same year. Its mission was to transport skilled and unskilled workers from Europe directly to North American companies suffering labor shortages. Potential candidates found the length of service required, at least a year, unappealing; only a few thousand workers ever contracted with the company. Additionally, individuals who accepted employment through AEC frequently scarpered at the first opportunity to do so. By 1870, the American Emigrant Company was bankrupt. A group of Chinese merchants, known as the Six Companies, oversaw the emigration of 180,000 Chinese immigrants to the American Northwest between 1849 and 1882 from its base in San Francisco, California. The Chinese organization did not sign contracts until after arrival stateside; it preferred a credit-ticket system. Under the auspices of a company agent, immigrants then entered contracts with American corporations that not only specified length of employment but which also allowed for <b>garnishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> to reimburse the Six Companies for ship tickets and other expenditures.|$|E

40|$|This study uses {{establishment}} {{level data}} {{to examine the}} effect of unionism on the wage structure within establishments.

Dispersion <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> between organized plants is reduced compared to dispersion <b>of</b> <b>wages</b> between unorganized plants, but by more modest amounts.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new evidence}} about wage stickiness {{and the nature}} <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> setting. We use a unique micro dataset on monthly frequency, covering wages in the Icelandic private sector for the period from 1998 - 2010, and draw the following conclusions. First, the mean frequency <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> change is 10. 8 % per month. When weighted for heterogeneity across industries and occupations the result is almost identical; the frequency of change is 10. 5 % per month. Second, only 0. 5 % <b>of</b> monthly <b>wage</b> changes are decreases. Third, the mean duration <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> spells is 8. 9 months. Onefifth <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> spells last longer than a year while other spells last for one year or shorter. Fourth, wage setting displays strong features of time-dependence: half <b>of</b> all <b>wage</b> changes are synchronised in January, but other adjustments are staggered through the year. Fifth, there is limited evidence of state-dependence: frequency <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> increases, size <b>of</b> increases, frequency <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> decreases and size of decreases do not correlate with inflation. However, both frequency and size <b>of</b> <b>wage</b> decreases have significant correlation with unemployment. Sixth, the hazard function for wages is mostly flat during the first months but has a large twelve-month spike. These facts align with a model <b>of</b> time-dependent <b>wage</b> contracts <b>of</b> fixed duration. ...|$|R
