The most {{important}} such solvents are <b>dimethylsulfoxide,</b> DMSO, and acetonitrile, CH3CN, as these solvents has been widely {{used to measure the}} acid dissociation constants of organic molecules. Because DMSO is a stronger proton acceptor than H2O the acid becomes a stronger acid in this solvent than in water. Indeed, many molecules behave as acids in non-aqueous solution that do not do so in aqueous solution. An extreme case occurs with carbon acids, where a proton is extracted from a C-H bond.|$|E

In {{solutions}} containing the fluoride ion, F−, it forms the fluoride complexes SnF3−, Sn2F5−, and SnF2(OH2). Crystallization from an aqueous solution containing NaF produces compounds containing polynuclear anions, e.g. NaSn2F5 or Na4Sn3F10 depending on the reaction conditions, rather than NaSnF3.

Many different solvents are suitable, including sulfolane (C4H8O2S), furfural (C5H4O2), tetraethylene glycol (C8H18O5), <b>dimethylsulfoxide</b> (C2H6OS), and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (C5H9NO).|$|E
5000|$|Experiments to {{determine}} the efficacy of cryoprotectants show that the leaf covering is relatively impermeable to sugars, proline, and polyethylene glycols, but that <b>dimethylsulfoxide</b> is readily absorbed.

5000|$|Common {{additives}} are electron donors, salts and proton traps [...] Electron donors (e.g. nucleophiles, Lewis bases) {{for example}} dimethylsulfide and <b>dimethylsulfoxide</b> {{are believed to}} stabilize the carbocation. The addition of salt for example a tetraalkylammonium salt, prevents dissociation of the ion pair that is the propagating reactive site. Ion dissociation into free ions lead to non-living polymerization. Proton traps scavenge protons originating from protic impurities.|$|E

5000|$|A {{commonly}} encountered side-reaction in Wolff-Kishner reductions involves azine formation by {{reaction of}} hydrazone with the carbonyl compound.

This can be complicated by further transformation of the product hydrazone to the corresponding hydrazine during product purification. Cram found that azine formation is favored by rapid addition of preformed hydrazones to potassium tert-butoxide in anhydrous <b>dimethylsulfoxide.</b>|$|E

50|$|SnF2 {{acts as a}} Lewis acid. For example, {{it forms}} a 1:1 complex (CH3)3NSnF2 and 2:1 complex (CH3)3N2SnF2 with trimethylamine, and a 1:1 complex with <b>dimethylsulfoxide,</b> (CH3)2SO.SnF2. In {{solutions}} containing the fluoride ion, F−, it forms the fluoride complexes SnF3−, Sn2F5−, and SnF2(OH2). Crystallization from an aqueous solution containing NaF produces compounds containing polynuclear anions, e.g. NaSn2F5 or Na4Sn3F10 depending on the reaction conditions, rather than NaSnF3. The compound NaSnF3, containing the pyramidal SnF3− anion, can be produced from a pyridine - water solution. Other compounds containing the pyramidal SnF3− anion are known, such as Ca(SnF3)2.|$|E
50|$|Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) is the non-water-soluble analog of BS3. DSS and BS3 {{express the}} same {{crosslinking}} ability toward primary amines. The major structural {{difference between these}} two molecules is that DSS does not contain the sulfonate substituents {{at either end of the}} molecule, and it is this difference that is responsible for the uncharged, non-polar nature of the DSS molecule. Due to the hydrophobic nature of this crosslinker it must be dissolved in an organic solvent such as <b>dimethylsulfoxide</b> before being added to an aqueous sample. Because of the ability of DSS to cross cell membranes, it is best suited for applications where intracelluclar crosslinking is needed.|$|E
50|$|SMA can be {{combined}} with the solvent <b>dimethylsulfoxide</b> (DMSO) in an application known as reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG). The process is under phase III clinical trials in India and is a non-surgical method of male sterilization that is inexpensive, highly effective, and reversible. It involves an injection of the solution into each of the patient's Vas deferens, which forms a layer around the vas walls partially (but not completely) blocking the flow of sperm cells. As cells pass by the substance, they are rendered inactive. If approved for widespread application, it could provide {{an alternative to the}} current two major methods of male contraception: condoms or vasectomies.|$|E
50|$|The dye (DiIC18(3)) is a violet crystal that is soluble in ethanol, methanol, dimethylformamide, and <b>dimethylsulfoxide.</b> The {{crystal form}} of the dye has melting point of 68 °C (at which it decomposes).The dye had an {{absorption}} maximum at 549 nm and an emission maximum 565 nm similar to tetramethyl rhodamine. It is mildly fluorescent in aqueous suspension, but becomes bright when bound to cell membrane. Once bound to a membrane it diffuses laterally in 2 dimensions; {{if there is no}} diffusion barrier, DiI generally stains the whole leaflet (one surface) of a biological membrane rapidly, but does not readily flip across to the other leaflet.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{route to}} polyamide-imides is the condensation of an aromatic diamine, such as methylene dianiline (MDA) and trimellitic acid chloride (TMAC). Reaction of the anhydride with the diamine produces an intermediate amic acid. The acid chloride functionality reacts with the aromatic amine {{to give the}} amide bond and hydrochloric acid (HCl) as a by-product. In the commercial preparation of polyamideimides, the polymerization is carried out in a dipolar, aprotic solvent such as N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), dimethylacetamide (DMAC), dimethylformamide (DMF), or <b>dimethylsulfoxide</b> (DMSO) at temperatures between 20-60 °C. The byproduct HCl must be neutralized in situ or removed by washing it from the precipitated polymer. Further thermal treatment of the polyamideimide polymer increases molecular weight and causes the amic acid groups to form imides with the evolution of water.|$|E
50|$|Transformation is a {{naturally}} occurring process in bacteria. Bacteria {{need to be}} in a certain physiological state to successfully take up exogenous DNA, which is described as one of competence. Some bacteria are naturally competent, but usually only for a brief time at a certain stage of their growth cycle. Bacteria can also be made competent through a variety of chemical treatments including exposure to calcium ions, or a mixture of polyethylene glycol and <b>dimethylsulfoxide,</b> which make the cell membrane more permeable, leading to the uptake of the exogenous DNA. Another treatment method is the utilisation of electricity as the membrane-permeabilizing agent (electroporation or electrotransformation). Finally, liposome-mediated transformation can be used. In this method DNA is coated with lipid. Fusion of this lipid and the membrane lipid can occur, facilitating the entry of DNA.|$|E
50|$|For {{the case}} of Ti3C2Tx and Ti2CTx, etching with {{concentrated}} hydrofluoric acid leads to open, accordion-like morphology with a compact distance between layers (this is common for other MXene compositions as well). To be dispersed in suspension, the material must be pre-intercalated with something like <b>dimethylsulfoxide.</b> However, when etching is conducted with hydrochloric acid and LiF as a fluoride source, morphology is more compact with a larger inter-layer spacing, presumably due to amounts of intercalated water. The material {{has been found to}} be ‘clay-like’: as seen in clay materials (e.g. smectite clays and kaolinite), Ti3C2Tx demonstrates the ability to expand its interlayer distance hydration and can reversibly exchange charge-balancing Group I and Group II cations. Further, when hydrated, the MXene clay becomes pliable and can be molded into desired shapes, becoming a hard solid upon drying. Unlike most clays, however, MXene clay shows high electrical conductivity upon drying and is hydrophilic, being easily dispersed into single layer two-dimensional sheets in water without surfactants. Further, due to these properties, it can be quickly rolled into free-standing, additive-free electrodes for energy storage applications.|$|E

The infected cells were synchronized by exposure to 2 mM thymidine. It is shown that <b>dimethylsulfoxide</b> must be present during DNA synthesis (S-phase) and, possibly, shortly thereafter, to induce differentiation assayed by measuring hemoglobin synthesis. In order to achieve an effective intracellular incorporation of <b>dimethylsulfoxide,</b> cells must be exposed to the agent for at least 24 - 30 hr before the critical S phase.

There was a close correlation between the enthalpic transitions and the structural changes associated with the pre- and main transitions of the phospholipids {{in the range of}} concentrations up to mole fractions of <b>dimethylsulfoxide</b> in water of 0. 1333. The temperature of the pre- and main transitions of the three phospholipids were found to increase linearly with increasing mole fraction of <b>dimethylsulfoxide.</b> The difference in phase stability between the lamellar gel and ripple phases induced by increasing <b>dimethylsulfoxide</b> concentration resulted in disappearance of the ripple phase and direct transition between lamellar gel and lamellar liquid-crystal phases. The effect of changing the properties of the solvent by the addition of <b>dimethylsulfoxide</b> on the dimensions of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and solvent layers of the bilayer repeat structure has been determined from electron density distribution calculations. The lamellar repeat spacing recorded at 25 degrees C decreased from 6. 36 nm in aqueous dispersion to 6. 04 nm in a dispersion containing a mole fraction of 0. 1105 <b>dimethylsulfoxide.</b> The results indicate that dipole interactions between solvent and phospholipid and dielectric properties of the solvent are important factors in the determination of the structure of saturated phosphatidylcholines...|$|E

40|$|Expression of the <b>dimethylsulfoxide</b> {{respiratory}} (dor) operon of Rhodobacter {{is regulated}} by oxygen, light intensity {{and availability of}} substrate. Since <b>dimethylsulfoxide</b> reductase contains a pterin molybdenum cofactor, the role of molybdate in the regulation of dor operon expression was investigated, In this report we show that the molybdate-responsive transcriptional regulator, MopB, and molybdate are essential for maximal <b>dimethylsulfoxide</b> reductase activity and expression of a dorA::lacZ transcriptional fusion in Rhodobacter capsulatus. In contrast, mop genes are not required {{for the expression of}} the periplasmic nitrate reductase or xanthine dehydrogenase in R. capsulatus under conditions of molybdenum sufficiency. This is the first report demonstrating a clear functional difference between the ModE homologues MopB and MopA in this bacterium. The results suggest that MopA is primarily involved in the regulation of nitrogen fixation gene expression in response to molybdate while MopB has a role in nitrogen fixation and <b>dimethylsulfoxide</b> respiration.
