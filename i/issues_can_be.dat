5|$|The leading case, Anti-Vivisection Society, {{sets out}} a strict rule that {{charities}} cannot campaign politically. An illustration of its strictness is Bowman v Secular Society, {{where it was}} held that even when attempted changes to the law were ancillary to the main goals, it was still unacceptable. There is a dividing line; charitable trusts discussing political <b>issues</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> valid, as discussed by Hoffmann J obiter dicta in Attorney General v Ross. This line is considered by the Charity Commission in their official guidelines, which allow the Commission {{to look at the}} wider purpose of the organisation when deciding if it constitutes a valid charity.|$|E

25|$|Linear {{programming}} {{is a widely}} used field of optimization for several reasons. Many practical problems in operations research can be expressed as linear programming problems. Certain special cases of linear programming, such as network flow problems and multicommodity flow problems are considered important enough to have generated much research on specialized algorithms for their solution. A number of algorithms for other types of optimization problems work by solving LP problems as sub-problems. Historically, ideas from linear programming have inspired many of the central concepts of optimization theory, such as duality, decomposition, {{and the importance of}} convexity and its generalizations. Likewise, linear {{programming is}} heavily used in microeconomics and company management, such as planning, production, transportation, technology and other issues. Although the modern management issues are ever-changing, most companies would like to maximize profits or minimize costs with limited resources. Therefore, many <b>issues</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> characterized as linear programming problems.|$|E
25|$|Joint authorship of articles, {{in which}} {{different}} users participate in correcting, editing, and compiling the finished product, {{can also cause}} editors to become tenants in common of the copyright, {{making it impossible to}} republish without permission of all co-owners, some of whose identities may be unknown due to pseudonymous or anonymous editing. However, where persons contribute to a collective work such as an encyclopedia, there is no joint ownership if the contributions are separate and distinguishable. Despite most wikis' tracking of individual contributions, the action of contributing to a wiki page is still arguably one of jointly correcting, editing, or compiling, which would give rise to joint ownership. Some copyright <b>issues</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> alleviated through the use of an open content license. Version 2 of the GNU Free Documentation License includes a specific provision for wiki relicensing; Creative Commons licenses are also popular. When no license is specified, an implied license to read and add content to a wiki may be deemed to exist on the grounds of business necessity and the inherent nature of a wiki, although the legal basis for such an implied license may not exist in all circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The {{exploration}} of female social roles in nineteenth-century {{society is a}} common theme in Davis's works. Her female characters {{can be viewed as}} early proto-feminist symbols because they exemplify the issues surrounding the commodification of women, and the patriarchal society that places restrictions on female identity. These <b>issues</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen in the heroine of Davis's novel Margret Howth. Though Howth works in the mills, her issues flow from her relations with her male counterparts. At novel's end she marries Stephen Holmes, which can both symbolize her acceptance of her Christian destiny despite her father's protestations, and her acceptance of the role of wife and mother. Through this character Davis is representing the power that patriarchal society has over the nineteenth-century female, while also presenting a strong female character who recognizes her moral independence. Davis goes further in her {{exploration of}} the true female identity by addressing the role domesticity plays in the lives of her characters. Domesticity, which once defined the roles of nineteenth-century women, is altered by Davis's placement of women in the iron mills. By describing the harsh conditions under which these women labored, Davis is capitalizing on the idea that women are capable of integrating work life into their home life.|$|E

25|$|The first Washington-Franklin stamp issued was a two-cent red Washington-head, {{issued on}} November 16, 1908, {{to pay the}} first class postage on a {{standard}} letter. The seven separate and distinct Washington-Franklin series appeared at intervals of {{a year or two}} and included denominations that ranged from 1-cent to 1 or 5 dollars, depending on the series. The different <b>issues</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> distinguished from one another by one or more of several factors: perforation gauge, the type of stamp paper—or, in some unusual varieties, by the printing method used. Four or five basic paper-types were employed during the life of the issue. Two of these have different watermarks (consisting of single-line and double line letters: 'USPS'), while another paper-type had no watermarks (watermarks are detected by placing the stamp in a special fluid). In 1909 a much less common type of bluish paper was used, made of 35% rag stock combined with the usual wood pulp and can readily be identified by its faint bluish-gray color. (N. B., Some contend that bluish paper contained only 10% rag stock.) Later in the same year the Post Office is supposed to have experimented with China clay paper, but whether such a paper stock actually existed has become a matter of dispute.|$|E

500|$|An early {{issue that}} {{attracted}} much attention, {{both positive and}} negative, was G.I. Joe #21, titled [...] "Silent Interlude", which was told entirely without words or sound effects. In a 1987 interview, Hama explained that the motivation for the story was that he [...] "... {{wanted to see if}} [...] could do a story that was a real, complete story—beginning, middle, end, conflict, characterization, action, solid resolution—without balloons or captions or sound effects." [...] At first, the issue was controversial; some readers felt cheated that it had no words and could be [...] "read" [...] so quickly. However, it eventually became one of the series' most enduring and influential issues. Issue #21 has been recognized as a modern comic classic, and has become a prime example of comics' visual storytelling power. Comic book artist and theorist Scott McCloud (author of Understanding Comics) describes [...] "Silent Interlude" [...] as [...] "... a kind of watershed moment for cartoonists of [...] generation. Everyone remembers it. All these things came out of it. It was like 9/11." [...] The issue would eventually be ranked #44 in Wizard Magazine's listing of the [...] "100 Best Single Issues Since You Were Born", and #6 on io9's [...] "10 Issues of Ongoing Comics that Prove Single <b>Issues</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Be</b> Great." ...|$|E

500|$|The initialisms LGBT or GLBT are not {{agreed to}} by {{everyone}} that they encompass. For example, some argue that transgender and transsexual causes {{are not the same}} as that of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people. This argument centers on the idea that transgenderism and transsexuality have to do with gender identity, or a person's understanding of being or not being a man or a woman irrespective of their sexual orientation. LGB <b>issues</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen as a matter of sexual orientation or attraction. These distinctions have been made in the context of political action in which LGB goals, such as same-sex marriage legislation and human rights work (which may not include transgender and intersex people), may be perceived to differ from transgender and transsexual goals. Another problem associated is that people may not always identify with the given labels. One study conducted in Australia discovered that all the participants had experienced microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours. However, not all of the participants believed their victimisation to be motivated by anti-LGBTIQ beliefs. What it did establish is that many of these microaggressions occurred due to misconceptions and conflicting opinions on what these labels entailed (in particular, transsexual and bisexual). Evidently, by placing blanket labels on many people, who all experience difference narratives, there are inconsistencies.|$|E

2500|$|Ecofeminist author Karren Warren lists Aldo Leopold's essay [...] "Land Ethic" [...] (1949) as a {{fundamental}} work to the ecofeminist conception, as Leopold {{was the first to}} pen an ethic for the land which understands all non-human parts of that community (animals, plants, land, air, water) as equal to and in a relationship with humans.
