25|$|Also in 1998, Dan Nastasi & John Milnes {{joined forces}} with former Mucky Pup and <b>Dog</b> <b>Eat</b> <b>Dog</b> bandmates Dave Neabore & Sean Kilkenny to become All Boro Kings. The project was {{a throwback to the}} early days of <b>Dog</b> <b>Eat</b> <b>Dog</b> as it focused on the {{hardcore}} style that <b>Dog</b> <b>Eat</b> <b>Dog</b> had originally displayed on their first two releases. The band quickly signed with Century Media Records who released their debut album Just For The Fun Of It in 2002. The album was released exclusively in Europe due to the strong European fan base the members had in their other bands. The band would also appear on several compilation albums. The band played most of their shows in and around New Jersey before embarking on one European tour with Biohazard, Agnostic Front, Hatebreed, Discipline, Death Threat and Born From Pain, as part of the Eastpak Resistance Tour. In 2004, All Boro Kings quietly disbanded.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{recording}} of the album, Nastasi stepped down from both Mucky Pup and <b>Dog</b> <b>Eat</b> <b>Dog.</b> It wasn't long before he re-joined the original lineup of Non-Fiction, now calling themselves #9. #9 {{was in the process}} of recording their debut when Nastasi accepted a solo record deal with SPV Records. Nastasi named the band Nastasee and recorded two albums, featuring collaborations with members of both Mucky Pup and <b>Dog</b> <b>Eat</b> <b>Dog.</b> Trim The Fat and Ule Tide were only intended for European release and as a result, the band embarked on four tours of the continent. Before Ule Tide could officially be released, Nastasee was dropped from the label and the album was never officially released outside of promotional and mail order copies. As a result, Nastasi disbanded his band.|$|E

25|$|After their breakup in 1996, Mucky Pup reunited for {{one night}} {{performances}} on several occasions, each time featuring a different incarnation or combination of previous lineups. In 1999, they reunited as an opening act for their first show ever with <b>Dog</b> <b>Eat</b> <b>Dog.</b> This was followed by five more one-off headlining reunion shows in 2000, 2002 & 2003.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{recording}} of A Boy In A Man's World, LePage, {{who had never been}} considered an official member of the band, left due to touring conflicts. He was replaced by Dave Neabore. Shortly after the album was released, the band found themselves on their first tour of Europe. Although Mucky Pup never had a hit in the U.S., their European distribution deal, combined with this tour, helped the band attain success in Europe. When the band returned home, Nastasi resigned and helped co-found the band Non-Fiction with former members of Hades. Nastasi stayed with Non-Fiction for a short time before leaving to embark on a brief stint with Murphy's Law. Nastasi's position in Mucky Pup was filled by band friend Sean Kilkenny. After a year or so, Neabore and Kilkenny left to form the band <b>Dog</b> <b>Eat</b> <b>Dog</b> and Nastasi returned to Mucky Pup while simultaneously joining <b>Dog</b> <b>Eat</b> <b>Dog</b> as well.|$|E
25|$|The band {{began playing}} shows with bands such as Primus, Gwar, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Murphy's Law, Bad Brains, 24-7 Spyz, and Scatterbrain. While Nastasi had {{returned}} to record Now, he no longer toured with the band as he was performing with <b>Dog</b> <b>Eat</b> <b>Dog</b> {{at the same time}} Mucky Pup was touring. As a result, new guitarist Splatter became the band's live guitarist. Splatter's time with band was brief and it wasn't long before he was replaced by Terry, who would remain their live guitarist until 1992.|$|E

Since the Layoffs was published by Soho Press in July 2003, followed by <b>Dog</b> <b>Eats</b> <b>Dog,</b> from Bitter Lemon Press in October 2008, and How To Rob An Armored Car, published by Soho Press a year later in October 2009.

25|$|Following their <b>Dog</b> <b>Eat</b> <b>Dog</b> {{world tour}} Lane {{temporarily}} left the band {{to start a}} solo career and the band was then dropped by Columbia, following the arrival of grunge {{and the death of}} Warrant's long-time manager Tom Hulett. In September 1993, Lane returned to the band and a short U.S. club tour commenced. In May 1994, guitarist Allen left Warrant and was followed by drummer Sweet in the following month. In November 1994, former Kingdom Come member, Rick Steier replaced Allen on guitar and fellow Kingdom Come alumnus James Kottak replaced Sweet on drums. Shortly thereafter, a new record deal was signed with Tom Lipsky of CMC Records in September 1994. A Japanese deal was signed with Pony Canyon Records at the same time.|$|E

25|$|In October, 2008, {{the band}} updated their website {{for the first}} time in several years. As part of the update, the band {{announced}} that they would embark on a European mini-tour in the summer of 2009. The reunited band, consisting of Chris Milnes, John Milnes, Dan Nastasi, Dave Neabore and Kevin Powers, made a United States appearance at Mexicali Live in Teaneck, New Jersey, on April 11, 2009, performing to a sold out crowd. In July, 2009, the band performed at the Rock for People and With Full Force festivals. The band made a second trip to Europe in late August to play a handful of festival dates with bands such as Municipal Waste, Gorefest, Flotsam and Jetsam, Sodom and Martyr, before ending the tour with a string of dates with Superbutt. The European tour dates featured the lineup of Chris Milnes, Dan Nastasi, Mark DeBacker and Kevin Powers performing songs voted on, via the internet, by their fans. The band returned to Mexicali Live on December 11 to perform their final show of 2009. The show was a release party for Live At Mexicali 2009, a DVD and CD recording of the show held at the same location, the previous April. Towards the end of Mucky Pup's set, the original lineup of <b>Dog</b> <b>Eat</b> <b>Dog</b> reunited onstage to perform two songs.|$|E

Richard Christiansen of the Chicago Tribune referred to it as a [...] "wimpy suspense movie shot in Chicago in the fall of 1983, [...] doesn't do much good for the city or for anyone connected with it", and considered Steiger to be [...] "acting in his high hysteria gear", who [...] "snarls and whines and overacts". Steiger took a break from cinema in the mid-1980s, during which he appeared in the Yorkshire Television mini-series The Glory Boys (1984) with Anthony Perkins, and Hollywood Wives (1985) with Angie Dickinson. Steiger and Perkins were at loggerheads during the production of The Glory Boys. Perkins resented the fact that Steiger insisted on a bigger trailer and felt that Steiger was trying to steal scenes from him, while Steiger had thought Perkins [...] "so jittery and jinxed by the chemicals he was taking" [...] that he felt sorry for him and believed that he was jeopardizing the success of the film.
