40|$|Numerous {{incidents}} of fire, explosion, and ground contamination have occurred at various facilities {{over the last}} several years due to drum rupture on account of overpressurization. These incidents frequently are caused by an ignition source or a reaction between incompatible materials. The incidents may also occur simply as a result of climatic changes causing the drum to be over pressurized. A device for venting a container having a bung includes a saddle assembly securable to a container and having a support extending therefrom. A first arm is rotatably secured to the support, and the first arm extends in a first direction. A second arm has a first end portion <b>drivingly</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> the first arm, so that rotation of the first arm causes rotation of the second arm. A second end portion of the first arm is positionable proximate the bung of the container. A socket is operably associated and rotatable with the second end portion and is drivingly engageable with the bung, so that rotation of the socket causes corresponding rotation of the bung for thereby venting the container...|$|E

50|$|To recapitulate, these ligands {{activate}} the NK, as we explained. However, before the activation, Killer Inhibition Receptors (KIRs) recognize certain molecules in the MHC class I of the hosted cell and get <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> them. These molecules {{are typical of}} healthy cells but some of these molecules are repressed in infected or transformed cells. For this reason when the hosted cell is really infected the proportion of KARs <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> ligands is bigger than the proportion of KIRs <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> MHC I molecules. When this happens the NK is activated and the hosted cell is destroyed. On the other hand, if there are more KIRs <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> MHC class I molecules than KARs <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> ligands, the NK isn't activated and the suspicious hosted cell remains alive. To conclude, we should add that each KAR has its specific KIR and they always work together. For instance, the C-type lectins receptors are inhibited by some CD94/NKG2 complex.|$|R
