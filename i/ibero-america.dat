25|$|Changmarín's {{short story}} {{collections}} are quite numerous and touch upon several themes and scopes. He tries {{to recreate the}} countryside storytelling and atmosphere to expose the problems concerning land ownership and exploitation suffered by the countryside people. The latifundia is still very common in <b>Ibero-America.</b> It is endorsed by the government, religious as well as right-wing policy-makers (who generally represent the rich sectors of the society) and transnational corporations.|$|E

25|$|Latin America is a {{group of}} {{countries}} and dependencies in the Americas where Spanish and Portuguese are predominant. The term originated in 19th century France as Amérique latine to consider French-speaking territories in the Americas (Haiti, French Guiana, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin, Saint Barthélemy) along with the larger group of countries where Spanish and Portuguese languages prevailed. It is therefore broader than the terms <b>Ibero-America</b> or Hispanic America—though it usually excludes French Canada and modern French Louisiana.|$|E

25|$|During his kingship, Juan Carlos {{followed}} {{a foreign policy}} during {{the first decade of}} his kingship coined Reencounter and Reconciliation, which greatly improved Spain's standing on the world stage. The king reconciled long standing historic tensions with the Netherlands and cultivated relationships with France and Germany which led directly to Spain's entry into the European Community and into NATO. Following the tensions between Franco and the Papacy over the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, Juan Carlos' personal relations with successive popes greatly improved diplomatic relations between the Holy See and Spain, and with Pope Paul VI blessing Juan Carlos' democratic reforms. According to historian Charles Powell, it was the king's goal to win Spain's full acceptance by other European powers. The king, a self-described Europeanist, was awarded the prestigious Charlemagne Award in 1982 for his steadfast work towards democracy and for supporting European unity. The constitution gives the monarch special responsibility in promoting Spanish relations with members of its historic community, the nations formerly part of the Spanish Empire and also relations with Portugal and Brazil. Fulfilling this responsibility, the King of Spain serves as president of the twenty-four member Ibero-American States Organization. With his support of democracy, various elements within <b>Ibero-America</b> political society have sought the king's advice on how to transition from a dictatorship to a democracy. For his efforts, by 2008 the king was voted the most popular leader in all of the <b>Ibero-America</b> community.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of music, Changmarín has {{produced}} {{a long list of}} compositions, both in writing lyrics and creating the musical arrangements. One of his best-known creations comprise the lyrics for Tio Caiman, made famous by the Chilean group Quilapayún. The piece has also been recorded in Colombia, Nicaragua, Cuba, and Panama by several music groups. The piece is sometimes sung by spectators in soccer matches and performed at music concerts across <b>Ibero-America.</b> Changmarín is hardly known as the creator, but this is a credit that he does not pursue. The Panamanian Birthday Song, recorded by the DEXA orchestra directed by Edgardo Quintero, is also one of his creations and {{is considered to be a}} unique contribution to the Panamanian culture and identity.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{presence}} of the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition in the Iberian American territories, initially converso immigration was barred throughout much of <b>Ibero-America.</b> Because of this, very few converso immigrants in Iberian American colonies ever reverted to Judaism. Of those conversos in the New World who did return to Judaism, it was principally those who had come via an initial respite of refuge in Holland and/or who were settling the New World Dutch colonies such as Curaçao and the area then known as New Holland (also called Dutch Brazil). Dutch Brazil was the northern portion of the colony of Brazil ruled by the Dutch for under {{a quarter of a century}} before it also fell to the Portuguese who ruled the remainder of Brazil. Jews who had only recently reverted in Dutch Brazil then again had to flee to other Dutch-ruled colonies in the Americas, including joining brethren in Curaçao, but also migrating to New Amsterdam, in what is today New York.|$|E
500|$|You {{could say}} that five hundred years ago was the basis of blood quantum in <b>Ibero-America.</b> But in Anglo-America, while there was some preoccupation with it, it was not formalized until {{the passage of the}} General Allotment Act, mid-1880s. At that point they began to define Indian as being someone who was demonstrably and documentably of at least one-quarter by quantum blood {{indigenous}} in a given group. You couldn't be an eighth Cheyenne and an eighth Arapaho and be an Indian. You had to be a quarter Cheyenne or a quarter Arapaho or hopefully a quarter and a quarter. The reason for this was quite clear. They were identifying Indians for purposes of allotting them individual parcels of land in the existing reservation base at that point. If they ran out of Indians identifiable as such, then the rest of the land would be declared surplus. So it was clearly {{in the interests of the}} government to create a definition of Indianness that would minimize the number of Indians that were available. It was an economic motivation for the application of this genetic criteria to Indianness in the first place. It's become increasingly so ever since." [...] (...) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{studies also}} show that persons of Sephardic Bnei Anusim origin (those who are {{descendants}} of the [...] "anusim" [...] who were forced to convert to Catholicism) throughout today's Iberia (Spain and Portugal) and <b>Ibero-America</b> (Hispanic America and Brazil), estimated that up to 19.8% of the modern population of Iberia and at least 10% of the modern population of <b>Ibero-America,</b> has Sephardic Jewish ancestry within the last few centuries. The Bene Israel and the Cochin Jews of India, Beta Israel of Ethiopia, and {{a portion of the}} Lemba people of Southern Africa, meanwhile, despite more closely resembling the local populations of their native countries, also have some more remote ancient Jewish descent.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the Anusim ("forced [...] ") {{who were}} the conversos up to the third, fourth or fifth {{generation}} (depending on the Jewish responsa) who later reverted to Judaism, the Bnei Anusim (" [...] sons/children/descendants [...] forced [...] ") were the subsequent generations of descendants of the Anusim who remained hidden ever since the Inquisition in the Iberian Peninsula and its New World franchises. At least some Sephardic Anusim in the Hispanosphere (in Iberia, but especially in their colonies in <b>Ibero-America)</b> had also initially tried to revert to Judaism, or at least maintain crypto-Jewish practices in privacy. This, however, was not feasible long-term in that environment, as Judaizing conversos in Iberia and <b>Ibero-America</b> remained persecuted, prosecuted, and liable to conviction and execution. The Inquisition itself was only finally formally disbanded in the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|With {{regard to}} {{religious}} affiliation among Spanish-speakers, Christianity [...] specifically Roman Catholicism [...] {{is usually the}} first religious tradition {{that comes to mind}} [...] The Spaniards and the Portuguese took the Roman Catholic faith to <b>Ibero-America</b> and the Philippines, and Roman Catholicism remains the predominant religion amongst most Hispanics. A small but growing number of Hispanics belong to a Protestant denomination.|$|E
2500|$|Latin America {{generally}} {{refers to}} territories in the Americas where the Spanish or Portuguese languages prevail: Mexico, most of Central and South America, {{and in the}} Caribbean, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. [...] Latin America is, therefore, defined as all {{those parts of the}} Americas that were once part of the Spanish and Portuguese Empires. By this definition, Latin America is coterminous with <b>Ibero-America</b> ("Iberian America").|$|E
2500|$|His {{clear and}} direct writing form {{serves as a}} tool for the {{constant}} struggles and protests that were taking place in <b>Ibero-America</b> during the 1970s and 1980s. The décima, having a bard-like effect as an artistic expression and Changmarín having mastered the form, managed to merge it with the social angst-ridden echoes of the dispossessed and the nationalist feelings of the people to [...] "incense a protest in each fist and a march in each step".|$|E
2500|$|... "Spanish and Portuguese Jews" [...] {{typically}} spoke both Spanish and Portuguese {{in their}} Early Modern forms. This {{is in contrast}} to the languages spoken by Eastern Sephardim and North African Sephardim, which were archaic Old Spanish derived Judaeo-Spanish dialects of Judaeo-Spanish ("Ladino") and Haketia (a mixture of Old Spanish, Hebrew, and Aramaic, plus various other languages depending on the area of their settlement). Their Early Modern languages also differ from modern Spanish and Portuguese, as spoken by Sephardic Bnei Anusim of Iberia and <b>Ibero-America,</b> including some recent returnees to Judaism in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} Spanish-speaking Jews, {{most of whom}} are the {{descendants}} of Ashkenazi Jews who migrated from Europe (German Jews, Russian Jews, Polish Jews, etc.) to Hispanic America, particularly Argentina, Uruguay, Peru and Cuba (Argentina is host to the third largest Jewish population in the Western Hemisphere, after the United States and Canada) in the 19th century and following World War II. Many Spanish-speaking Jews also originate from the small communities of reconverted descendants of anusim [...] those whose Spanish Sephardi Jewish ancestors long ago hid their Jewish ancestry and beliefs in fear of persecution by the Spanish Inquisition in the Iberian Peninsula and <b>Ibero-America.</b> The Spanish Inquisition led to a large number of forced conversions of Spanish Jews.|$|E
2500|$|Members of {{the royal}} family also pursue {{charitable}} and cultural causes of special interest to themselves. [...] As prince, King Felipe chaired the Prince of Asturias Foundation (Fundación Príncipe de Asturias), which aims to promote [...] "scientific, cultural and humanistic values that form part of mankind's universal heritage." [...] The Prince of Asturias Foundation holds annual awards ceremonies acknowledging the contributions of individuals, entities, and organizations which make notable achievements in the sciences, humanities, or public affairs. Felipe serves as president of the Codespa Foundation, which finances specific economic and social development activities in <b>Ibero-America</b> and other countries, and serves as president of the Spanish branch of the Association of European Journalists, which is composed of achieving communications professionals. Felipe also serves as honorary chair of the Ministry of Culture National Awards Ceremonies.|$|E
2500|$|The Spanish Constitution of 1978 {{reestablished}} {{a constitutional}} monarchy as {{the form of}} government for Spain. The 1978 constitution affirmed {{the role of the}} King of Spain as the personification and embodiment of the Spanish State and a symbol of Spain's enduring unity and permanence. Constitutionally, the king is [...] the head-of-state and commander-in-chief of the Spanish Armed Forces. The constitution codifies the use of royal styles and titulary, royal prerogatives, hereditary succession to the crown, compensation, and a regency-guardianship contingency in cases of the monarch's minority or incapacitation. According to the constitution, the monarch is also instrumental in promoting relations with the [...] "nations of its historical community". The King of Spain serves {{as the president of the}} Ibero-American States Organization, purportedly representing over 700,000,000 people in twenty-four member nations worldwide. In 2008, Juan Carlos I was considered the most popular leader in all <b>Ibero-America.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In modern Iberia, {{practicing}} Jews of Sephardic origins, {{such as the}} Jewish {{community of}} Oporto, however, are also not Western Sephardim, but are Neo-Western Sephardim, as they were re-established in the 20th century and early 21st centuries with a campaign of outreach to the crypto-Jews of Sephardic Bnei Anusim origins. The Oporto community's return to Judaism was led by the returnee to Judaism Captain Artur Carlos de Barros Basto (1887–1961), known also as the [...] "apostle of the Marranos". In 1921, realizing that there were less than twenty Ashkenazi Jews living in Porto, and that recent returnees to Judaism like himself were not organized and had to travel to Lisbon for religious purposes whenever necessary, Barros Basto {{began to think about}} building a synagogue and took initiative in 1923 to officially register the Jewish Community of Porto and the Israelite Theological Center in the city council of Porto. As mentioned, these communities of modern-day returnees to Judaism are among the first in the emergence of the nascent Neo-Western Sephardim. Neo-Western Sephardim are the modern returnees to Judaism throughout Iberia and <b>Ibero-America</b> emerging from among the population of Sephardic Bnei Anusim, and are distinct from Western Sephardim (those termed [...] "Spanish and Portuguese Jews").|$|E
2500|$|Judaeo-Spanish, {{sometimes}} called [...] "Ladino Oriental" [...] (Eastern Ladino), was a Romance language derived from Old Spanish, incorporating elements {{from all the}} old Romance languages of the Iberian Peninsula, Hebrew and Aramaic, and was spoken by what became the Eastern Sephardim, who settled in the Eastern Mediterranean, taken {{with them in the}} 15th century after the expulsion from Spain in 1492. This dialect was further influenced by Ottoman Turkish, Levantine Arabic, Greek, Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian vocabulary in the differing lands of their exile. Haketia (also known as [...] "Tetouani" [...] in Algeria), an Arabic-influenced Judaeo-Spanish variety also derived from Old Spanish, with numerous Hebrew and Aramaic terms was spoken by North African Sephardim, taken with them in the 15th century after the expulsion from Spain in 1492. The main feature of this dialect is the heavy influence of the Jebli Arabic dialect of northern Morocco. Early Modern Spanish and Early Modern Portuguese, including in a mixture of the two was traditionally spoken or used liturgically by the ex-converso Western Sephardim, taken with them during their later migration out of Iberia between the 16th and 18th centuries as conversos, after which they reverted to Judaism. Modern Spanish and Modern Portuguese varieties, traditionally spoken by the Sephardic Bnei Anusim of Iberia and <b>Ibero-America,</b> including some recent returnees to Judaism in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. In this latter case, these varieties have incorporated loanwords from the indigenous languages of the Americas introduced following the Spanish conquest.|$|E
