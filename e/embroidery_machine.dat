25|$|In 1983 Tajima {{created the}} TMLE Series Multi-Head Electronic Lock Stitch Chenille <b>Embroidery</b> <b>machine,</b> {{followed}} by the TMEF Series 9-needle Type Electronic <b>Embroidery</b> <b>Machine</b> in 1984.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 Tajima {{introduced}} the world's first sequin <b>embroidery</b> <b>machine,</b> enabling designers to combine sequin Embroidery with plain embroidery.|$|E
25|$|Before {{computers}} were affordable, most machine embroidery {{was completed by}} punching designs on paper tape that then ran through an <b>embroidery</b> <b>machine.</b> One error could ruin an entire design, forcing the creator to start over.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995, Tajima added a multi-color (6-color) type to {{chenille}} <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines,</b> {{and announced}} {{the ability to}} mix <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines</b> with plain chenille embroidery. They also began sales of the TLFD Series Laser-cut <b>Embroidery</b> <b>Machines.</b> In 1996, Pulse Microsystems introduced the computational geometry based simulation of hand created chenille using a spiral effect. Following this in 1997, Tajima introduced 15-needle machines, {{in response to the}} [...] "multi-color-age".|$|R
25|$|<b>Machine</b> <b>embroidery</b> {{dates back}} to 1964, when Tajima started to {{manufacture}} and sell TAJIMA Multi-head Automatic <b>Embroidery</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most modern <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines</b> are {{computer}} controlled and specifically engineered for embroidery.Industrial and commercial <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines</b> and combination sewing-embroidery machines have a hooping or framing system {{that holds the}} framed area of fabric taut under the sewing needle and moves it automatically to create a design from a pre-programmed digital embroidery pattern.|$|R
25|$|Digitize: The {{computerized}} {{technique of}} turning a design image into an embroidery program. Special software {{is used to}} create plotting commands for the <b>embroidery</b> <b>machine.</b> The commands are transferred to the machine's logic head by a designated embroidery language.|$|E
25|$|Digitized {{embroidery}} design files can {{be either}} purchased or created with industry-specific embroidery digitizing software. Embroidery file formats broadly fall into two categories. The first, source formats, are specific to the software used to create the design. For these formats, the digitizer keeps the original file {{for the purposes of}} editing. The second, machine formats, are specific to a particular brand of <b>embroidery</b> <b>machine.</b> In this case, the files are available for use with particular embroidery machines and are not easily edited or scaled.|$|E
2500|$|In 1982, Tajima {{introduced}} the world's first electronic chenille <b>embroidery</b> <b>machine,</b> called the TMCE Series Multi-head Electronic Chenille <b>Embroidery</b> <b>Machine.</b> [...] In [...] the same year, they developed the automatic frame changer, a dedicated apparatus for rolled textile embroidery. [...] Also in 1982, Pulse Microsystems introduced Stitchworks, the first PC based embroidery software, {{and the first}} software based on outlines rather than stitches. [...] This was monumental to decorators, in that it allowed them to scale and change the properties and parts of their designs easily, on the computer. [...] Designs were output to paper tape, which was read by the <b>embroidery</b> <b>machine.</b> [...] Stitchworks was sold worldwide by Macpherson.|$|E
25|$|Most modern <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines</b> are {{computer}} controlled and specifically engineered for embroidery.|$|R
2500|$|In 1987 Pulse Microsystems {{introduced}} a {{digital asset management}} application called DDS, which was a design librarian for <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines.</b> [...] This made it more efficient for machine operators to access their designs. [...] In 1988 Tajima designed the TMLE-D5 series <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines,</b> with a pair arrangement of lock-stitch-handle embroidery heads, which were capable of sewing multiple threads.|$|R
50|$|The Bernina Textile Group is a {{globally}} {{active group}} of 15 companies {{doing business in}} 80 countries. The company operates in the product categories such as household sewing and <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines,</b> household overlocker machines, longarm quilting <b>machines,</b> multi-needle <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines,</b> accessories (presser foot, embroidery hoops and other accessories for sewing, quilting and overlocking) and computer software for embroidery design.|$|R
2500|$|The basic {{steps for}} {{creating}} embroidery with a computerized <b>embroidery</b> <b>machine</b> are as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{load the}} final design file into the <b>embroidery</b> <b>machine</b> after {{making sure it}} is the right format and it will fit in the {{appropriate}} hoop.|$|E
2500|$|... {{start and}} monitor the <b>embroidery</b> <b>machine,</b> to change thread colors, {{rethread}} machine, and troubleshoot problems. The operator should {{have plenty of}} needles, bobbins, a can of air (or small air compressor), a small brush, and scissors..|$|E
25|$|Not all {{machines}} are solely used for embroidery; some {{are also used}} for sewing. Some of the more advanced features becoming available include a large color touchscreen, a USB interface, auto threading, built-in design editing software, embroidery adviser software, and design file storage systems. Commercial <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines</b> can be purchased with a set number of needle colors per head(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 15,18 or more colors). Industrial <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines</b> are available with 1 to 56 heads.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Pulse Microsystems {{introduced}} networking to <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines.</b> [...] It added a box, which {{allowed them to}} network and then pull designs from a central server. [...] It also provided machine feedback, and allowed machines to be optically isolated to protect machines in an industrial environment. Since then, computerized <b>machine</b> <b>embroidery</b> has grown in popularity as costs have fallen for computers, software, and <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines.</b> Many machine manufacturers sell their own lines of embroidery patterns. In addition, many individuals and independent companies also sell embroidery designs, and there are free designs available on the internet.|$|R
50|$|The {{finished}} fabric {{is used to}} manufacture garment and apparel. This laboratory includes all sorts of industrial cutting, sewing, over-locking, interlocking and <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1973 Tajima {{introduced}} the TMB Series 6-needle (6 color) full-automatic color-change <b>embroidery</b> <b>machine.</b> [...] A few years later, in 1978, Tajima started manufacturing the TMBE Series Bridge Type Automatic Embroidery machines. [...] These machines introduced electronic 6-needle automatic color change technology.|$|E
2500|$|Bobbin: A small spool {{of thread}} inside the rotary hook housing of a sewing machine. The bobbin thread forms the {{stitches}} {{on the underside}} of the garment. [...] Bobbin thread holds the top embroidery thread to the garment. The bobbin on an <b>embroidery</b> <b>machine</b> works in the same manner and for the same purpose as on a standard sewing machine.|$|E
2500|$|After editing {{the final}} design, the file is {{loaded into the}} <b>embroidery</b> <b>machine.</b> Different {{machines}} require different formats that are proprietary to that company. Common design file formats for the home and hobby market include [...]ART, [...]HUS, [...]JEF, [...]PES, [...]SEW, and [...]VIP. [...] Embroidery patterns can {{be transferred to the}} computerized embroidery machines through cables, CDs, floppy disks, USB interfaces, or special cards that resemble flash or compact cards.|$|E
25|$|Industrial and {{commercial}} <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines</b> and combination sewing-embroidery machines have a hooping or framing system {{that holds the}} framed area of fabric taut under the sewing needle and moves it automatically to create a design from a pre-programmed digital embroidery pattern.|$|R
50|$|Brother Industries {{manufacture}} mechanical {{sewing machines}} in Zhuhai, China and computerised sewing & <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines</b> in Taiwan. A new sewing machine factory was opened in 2012 in Đồng Nai Province, Vietnam, {{which is the}} largest single brand sewing machine factory in the world.|$|R
50|$|By adding {{controlled}} {{motion of}} the material being sewn through an additional set of motors, arbitrary customized patterns of 100 cm or more in each direction can be sewn, {{opening the door to}} the very popular category of programmable household <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Machine {{embroidery}} is an embroidery {{process whereby}} {{a sewing machine}} or <b>embroidery</b> <b>machine</b> is used to create patterns on textiles. It is used commercially in product branding, corporate advertising, and uniform adornment. It is also used in the fashion industry to decorate garments and apparel. [...] Machine embroidery is used by hobbyists and crafters to decorate gifts, clothing, and home decor. [...] Examples include designs on quilts, pillows, and wall hangings.|$|E
2500|$|Brother Industries {{entered the}} {{embroidery}} industry after several computerized embroidery companies contracted it to provide sewing heads. Pulse Microsystems developed a software for them called PG1. [...] PG1 had a tight integration with the <b>embroidery</b> <b>machine</b> using high level protocol, enabling {{the machine to}} pull designs from software, rather than having the software push designs to the machine. [...] This approach is still used today. Singer failed to remain competitive during this time. Melco was acquired by Saurer in 1989.|$|E
2500|$|The major <b>embroidery</b> <b>machine</b> companies, and {{software}} developers {{are continuing to}} adapt their commercial systems to market them for home use, for companies such as Janome, RNK, Floriani, Tacony Corporation, and many more. [...] As costs have fallen for computers, software, and home market embroidery machines, the popularity for machine embroidery as a hobby as risen, and as such, many machine manufacturers sell their own lines of embroidery patterns. [...] In addition, many individuals and independent companies also sell embroidery designs, and there are free designs available on the internet.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the first <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines</b> were developed in St. Gallen. In 1910 the embroidery production constituted the largest export branch (18% of the total export value) in Switzerland {{and more than half of}} the worldwide production of embroidery originated in St. Gallen. One fifth of the population of the eastern part of Switzerland was involved with the textile industry. However, World War I and the Great Depression caused another severe crisis for St. Gallen embroidery. Only in the 1950s did the textile industry recover somewhat. Nowadays, because of competition and the prevalence of computer-operated <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines,</b> only a reduced textile industry has survived in St. Gallen; but its embroidered textiles are still popular with Parisian haute couture designers.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Embroidery</b> <b>machines</b> {{generally}} {{have one or}} more machine formats specific to their brand. However, some formats such as Tajima's [...]dst, Melco's [...]exp/.cnd and Barudan's [...]fdr have become so prevalent that they have effectively become industry standards and are often supported by machines built by rival companies.|$|R
50|$|There {{has also}} been a {{development}} in free hand <b>machine</b> <b>embroidery,</b> new <b>machines</b> have been designed that allow for the user to create free-motion embroidery which has its place in textile arts, quilting, dressmaking, home furnishings and more.|$|R
2500|$|In 1980 {{the first}} {{computerized}} embroidery machines {{were introduced to}} the home market. [...] Wilcom introduced the first computer graphics embroidery design system to run on a minicomputer. Melco, an international distribution network formed by Randal Melton and Bill Childs, created the first embroidery sample head for use with large Schiffli looms. These looms spanned several feet across and produced lace patches and large embroidery patterns. The sample head allowed embroiderers to avoid manually sewing the design sample and saved production time. Subsequently, it became the first computerized <b>embroidery</b> <b>machine</b> marketed to home sewers.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{multiple}} types of machine embroidery. Free-motion sewing machine embroidery uses a basic zigzag sewing machine. [...] Designs are done manually. [...] Most commercial embroidery {{is done with}} link stitch embroidery. In link stitch embroidery, patterns may be manually or automatically controlled. [...] Link Stitch embroidery {{is also known as}} chenille embroidery, and was patented by Pulse Microsystems in 1994. [...] More modern computerized machine embroidery [...] uses an <b>embroidery</b> <b>machine</b> or sewing/embroidery machine that is controlled with a computer that embroiders stored patterns. These machines may have multiple heads and threads.|$|E
2500|$|Melco {{patented}} {{the ability}} to sew circles with a satin stitch, as well as arched lettering generated from a keyboard. An operator digitized the design using similar techniques to punching, transferring the results to a 1" [...] paper tape or later to a floppy disk. This design would then be run on the <b>embroidery</b> <b>machine,</b> which stitched out the pattern. Wilcom enhanced this technology in 1982 {{with the introduction of}} the first multi-user system, which allowed more than one person to work on the embroidery process, streamlining production times.|$|E
50|$|The first laser bridge for <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines</b> {{was invented}} and {{realized}} in 1998 by GMI srl an Italian {{company based in}} Vittorio Veneto (TV) Italy. The laser bridge was first presented {{to the public at}} the IMB exhibition of Cologne, Germany in 2000.GMI srl continue manufacturing laser bridges and since 1998 has largely improved the quality of its cutting systems.|$|R
50|$|Jalisco, a Mexican State {{was famous}} {{for this type of}} handicraft, {{especially}} the town of Colotlan. This region has become a big producer of two kinds of non-traditional piteado industry. One which uses automated manufacturing <b>embroidery</b> <b>machines</b> to make imitation piteado products and one where non-precious silvery and golden wires are inserted in leather works which are then fraudulently traded as genuine gold and silver.|$|R
5000|$|Bernina International AG is {{a privately}} owned {{international}} manufacturer of sewing and embroidery systems. The company {{was founded in}} 1893 in Steckborn, Switzerland, by a Swiss inventor Fritz Gegauf. The company develops, manufactures and sells goods and services for the textile market, primarily household sewing-related products {{in the fields of}} embroidery, quilting, home textiles, garment sewing and crafting.
