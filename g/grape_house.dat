50|$|The estate's first {{greenhouse}} {{was constructed}} before 1800 and {{is thought to}} be the oldest in the United States. The <b>Grape</b> <b>House,</b> built in 1804 to raise exotic fruits such as oranges, pineapples, and bananas, today houses extensive grape vines, grown from cuttings taken in 1870 from Hampton Court in England. The Camellia House was built around 1820 for cultivation of camellias, introduced to America via Europe in 1797 from coastal China, Japan, and Korea.

5000|$|The Rosedale {{district}} of Toronto {{was named after}} Jarvis' residence, Rosedale House, that formerly occupied that space. The house, which overlooked Castle Frank Brook, {{a tributary of the}} Don River, was [...] "a wonderful rambling villa {{perched on the edge of}} a ravine... with a wildflower garden, a conservatory full of hothouse flowers, and, the envy of Toronto, a magnificent curving double staircase that descended to a foyer panelled in richest walnut." [...] Two new wings were added to either side of the house c.1830 containing a peach house, a <b>grape</b> <b>house,</b> bedrooms, a morning room and a large verandah. Orchards, quiet arbours, rose gardens and masses of flowers surrounded the house, which was named by Jarvis' wife Mary, granddaughter of William Dummer Powell, for the wild roses that grew so abundantly throughout the estate.|$|E

50|$|During the 1920s, Shepherd Market was a {{run down}} area, popular with {{writers and artists}} such as Michael Arlen and Sophie Fedorovitch. Arlen rented rooms {{opposite}} The <b>Grapes</b> public <b>house</b> and used Shepherd Market as the setting for his best-selling 1924 novel The Green Hat, which prompted Anthony Powell {{to move into the}} area in 1926.|$|R

25|$|In 2007 the INAO, the {{government}} organization that controls wine appellations in France, {{was preparing to}} make the largest revision of the region's legal boundaries since 1927, in response to economic pressures. With soaring demand and limited production of <b>grapes,</b> Champagne <b>houses</b> say the rising price could produce a consumer backlash that would harm the industry for years into the future. That, along with political pressure from villages that want {{to be included in}} the expanded boundaries, led to the move. Changes are subject to significant scientific review and are said to not impact Champagne produced grapes until 2020.|$|R

50|$|On {{the south}} side of Narrow Street is a rare example of an early Georgian brick terrace. With the {{exception}} of the westernmost property (The <b>Grapes</b> public <b>house)</b> it was standing derelict and abandoned, but in 1964 the writer Andrew Sinclair bought and saved one of the houses and persuaded his Cambridge friends to buy the others. (Early Georgian houses can be distinguished from late ones {{in the way that the}} windows are not set back from the brick frontage.) The Grapes (formerly The Bunch of Grapes, and known to the young Charles Dickens) was notably bought in 2011 by actor Sir Ian McKellen, director Sean Mathias and Evening Standard owner Evgeny Lebedev.|$|R
5|$|Given Huskisson's importance, and the {{potential}} impact {{on the future of}} Liverpool and Manchester's industries and on the embryonic railway industry of any findings of liability {{on the part of the}} railway, a swift determination of the causes of the accident was considered essential. By 9.00am on the morning after the accident, a hastily convened coroner's jury was assembled in the <b>Grapes</b> public <b>house</b> in Eccles. The coroner himself, MrMilne, arrived at 10.00am and was in a hurry to proceed as he had another inquest scheduled that afternoon, but proceedings were unable to begin as Lord Wilton, the only sworn witness scheduled to attend the inquest, could not be found. In the meantime, Milne sent the jury to the vicarage to view Huskisson's body.|$|R
5|$|McKellen and {{his first}} partner, Brian Taylor, a history teacher from Bolton, began their {{relationship}} in 1964. Their relationship lasted for eight years, ending in 1972. They lived in London, where McKellen continued to pursue his career as an actor. For over a decade, he has lived in a five-storey Victorian conversion in Narrow Street, Limehouse. In 1978 he met his second partner, Sean Mathias, at the Edinburgh Festival. This relationship lasted until 1988, and acording to Mathias, was tempestuous, with conflicts over McKellen's success in acting versus Mathias's somewhat less-successful career. Mathias later directed McKellen in Waiting for Godot at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2009. The pair entered into a business partnership with Evgeny Lebedev, purchasing the lease on The <b>Grapes</b> public <b>house</b> in Narrow Street.|$|R

The tunnel has not been built in a straight line, but with a slight S-shaped curvature that nevertheless allows to keep at least one entrance in sight at any point of its route. A ventilation shaft had been built about [...] from its western portal.

60|$|On {{their side}} the {{garrison}} {{on the terrace}} disregarded the musketry fire, but, crowded behind the sandbags, kept up a steady and concentrated fire at the flashes of the cannon; while from the battery below, the gunners, unable to touch the enemy's battery, discharged <b>grape</b> at the <b>houses</b> tenanted by the enemy's infantry. The Sepoys, carefully instructed in our service, had constructed shields of rope to each gun to protect the gunners, but those at the best could cover but one or two men, and the fire from the parapet inflicted such heavy losses upon the gunners that after a time their fire dropped, and an hour from the commencement of the cannonade all was still again on both sides. The Sepoy guns were silenced.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout {{most of the}} 19th century Champagne {{was made}} sweet. The taste was {{pleasing}} to most wine drinkers and the added sugar helped winemakers to cover up flaws in the wine or poor quality from less desirable <b>grapes.</b> Champagne <b>houses</b> would use the dosage to tailor the sweetness to whatever style was in fashion in a particular market. The Russians preferred the sweetest level with as much as 250–330grams of sugar added. Scandinavia was next at around 200grams followed by France at 165grams, Germany with slightly more, and the United States preferring between 110–165grams. The English preferred the driest style at 22–66grams of sugar. Gradually tastes developed to favor less sweetness and higher overall quality in the Champagne. The first slightly dry Champagne to emerged was labeled demi-sec or [...] "half dry". The success of those wines prompted the introduction of sec or dry wines. [...] Other producers made wines with even less sugar and began to call these wines extra dry. In 1846, the Champagne house Perrier-Jouët introduced a wine that was made without any added sugar. This style was initially ill-received with critics calling this wine too severe, or -like. But over the next generation, this [...] "brut" [...] style with significantly less sugar than wines labeled extra dry became the fashion for Champagne and today is the modern style {{that the majority of}} Champagne is made in.|$|R
25|$|Wimbledon {{originally}} {{played on}} Wimbledon Common, using the Fox and <b>Grapes</b> public <b>house</b> in Camp Road as the team's headquarters and changing room. The club moved to Plough Lane in September 1912. During the 1930s and 1940s, crowds of between 7,000 and 10,000 were not uncommon at the ground. Wimbledon's highest {{attendance at the}} ground came on 2 March 1935, when 18,080 people were attracted to an FA Amateur Cup tie against HMS Victory. However, the ground was basic, and even after the club's rapid rise to the First Division Plough Lane had changed little from Wimbledon's amateur days. The only notable difference was the addition of floodlights, first used on 3 October 1960 in a London Charity Cup match against Arsenal. At {{the time of the}} club's acceptance into The Football League, applicants had only to meet minimal stadium criteria, and once in the League these same criteria sufficed whether the club subsequently found itself in the Fourth or First Division. Following the Hillsborough disaster and the Taylor Report, the football authorities introduced far stricter safety rules that gave top-flight clubs specific deadlines by which to redevelop terraced grounds or to build new all-seater stadiums. The board of the club decided that Plough Lane could not be made to comply with this economically and, in 1990, announced plans to temporarily groundshare with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park in the town of Croydon, Surrey. When the club competed in the Intertoto Cup in 1995 Selhurst Park was not available, so Wimbledon's home games were played at the Goldstone Ground, the then home ground of Brighton & Hove Albion.|$|R
60|$|According {{to his own}} accounts, Mr. Tom Starbrow was up in town on business; {{apparently}} the business was not of a very pressing nature, as {{most of his time}} during the next few days was spent at Dawson Place, where he and his sister had endless conversations about old times. Then he would go with Fan to explore Whiteley's, which seemed to require a great deal of exploring; and from these delightful rambles they would return laden with treasures--choice bon-bons, exotic flowers and hot- <b>house</b> <b>grapes</b> at five or six shillings a pound; quaint Japanese knick- knacks; books and pictures, and photographs of celebrated men--great beetle-browed philosophers, and men of blood and thunder; also of women still more celebrated, on and off the stage. Mr. Starbrow would have nothing sent; the whole fun of the thing, he assured Fan, was in carrying all their purchases home themselves; and so, laden with innumerable small parcels, they would return chatting and laughing like the oldest and best of friends, happy and light-hearted as children.|$|R
