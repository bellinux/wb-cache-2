40|$|This study {{investigates the}} role of <b>digital</b> <b>channels</b> in community-led {{businesses}} by exploring two case study companies, Uber and Airbnb. At present, these community-led businesses are disrupting traditional industries by connecting with customers via <b>digital</b> <b>channels</b> and facilitating transactions between two parties. A deductive structured qualitative content analysis approach utilising a predetermined categorization matrix was implemented to decipher the <b>digital</b> <b>channels</b> used by both companies. The results discovered that both companyâ€™s <b>digital</b> <b>channels</b> push the customer to their core channel, allowing, customers {{to create their own}} physical, largely self-governed communities. However, little research exists which explores and analyses {{the role of}} <b>digital</b> <b>channels</b> in forming community-led businesses. Therefore, this paper aims to instigate future research and discussion in this emerging area by concluding with future research agendas...|$|R

5|$|Neighbours is an Australian {{television}} soap opera. It {{was first}} broadcast on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. It {{was created by}} TV executive Reg Watson, who proposed {{the idea of making}} a show that focused on realistic stories and portrayed adults and teenagers who talk openly and solve their problems together. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson's Sons and Daughters, which aired on the network. Although successful in Melbourne, Neighbours underperformed in the Sydney market and struggled for months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network Ten. After taking over production of the show, the new network had to build replica sets because Seven destroyed the originals to prevent its rival from obtaining them. Ten began screening Neighbours on 20 January 1986, taking off where the previous series left off and commencing with episode 171. Neighbours has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and in 2005, it was inducted collectively into the Logie Hall of Fame. On 11 January 2011, Neighbours moved to Ten's <b>digital</b> <b>channel,</b> Eleven.|$|E
