50|$|What {{separates}} Brain typing from Jungian typology and its offshoots, {{such as the}} Myers-Briggs <b>Type</b> <b>Indicator</b> (MBTI) and Socionics, is {{its emphasis}} on motor skills. Each of the sixteen brain types is said to specialize in certain regions of the brain responsible for varying degrees of mental and motor skills. Niednagel believes the types are inherited, possessing a genetic basis. The brain types website and books also explain how it differs from the Myers-Briggs <b>Type</b> <b>Indicator</b> in that it believes the ENTP/FCIR type {{is by far the}} most common of the sixteen types, whereas some other types presumed as common in the Myers-Briggs <b>Type</b> <b>Indicator,</b> such as the ISTJ/BEIL, are actually only about 3% of the populace according to their estimates.|$|R
