40|$|In the Republic of Macedonia, the {{legislator}} {{has tried}} {{to solve the problem}} of late payment in commercial transactions by enacting the Financial Discipline Act. The justifications for enacting this Act were the illiquidity of the business sector and the implementation of the EU Directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions. Yet, the Act includes several differences in comparison to the regime envisaged in the Directive. The time limits governing the performance of monetary liabilities in transactions between economic operators (undertakings) are identical with those in the EU Directive; however, the Act does not regulate payment in installment and does not provide for an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> unless expressly agreed. On the other hand, public authorities have a few privileges: time limits for commercial transactions between public authorities and economic operators are identical with the time limits for transactions between economic operators (whereas in the Directive time limits for public authorities are shorter); contracts on perennial procurement are exempt from compliance with this Act; and particular categories of public authorities should comply with the general time limits for commercial transactions as of 1 January 2016. Additionally, considering the prescribed misdemeanor sanctions applicable in cases where the debtor has failed to pay within the prescribed time limits, the purpose of the Financial Discipline Act remains unclear. Has it been enacted to increase or to reduce the liquidity in the national economy?...|$|E

Reports on tank bottom assessments already carried out in Germany, and comparative investigations of the tank inside by means of non-destructive test methods were analysed and appraised, {{in order to examine}} the reliability of this special method. From this the following recommendation could be deduced: The {{acoustic emission technique}} for the assessment of tank bottoms can, among other things, contribute to a preliminary decision on whether tanks need a closer inspection or whether an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for testing may be appropriate.

40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>Limit</b> for Tax Assessment The thesis {{deals with}} the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax {{assessment}} as it is regulated especially in the Tax Procedure Code (Act No. 280 / 2009 Coll.). The <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment represents a period <b>of</b> <b>time</b> during which {{it is possible to}} assess the tax. This <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> thus creates a <b>time</b> frame <b>of</b> the whole tax administration because tax decision is its aim, and in the case in which tax cannot be assessed {{there is no reason to}} proceed with any tax administration. Its main purpose consists in the establishment of certainty providing that after the lapse of the period <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> rights and duties relating to substantive tax law cannot be changed. The thesis is composed of two basic chapters. Chapter One is introductory and describes the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> It is subdivided into three parts. Part One focuses on the concept and categories <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Part Two explains general aspects <b>of</b> the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Part Three {{deals with the}} calculation <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Chapter Two focuses on legal regulation <b>of</b> the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Chapter Two is divided in ten parts. Part One defines the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment.

50|$|A major worry was the {{upcoming}} future write-off on ABN-AMRO: the price paid included {{a huge amount}} for intangibles {{that could not be}} put on the balance sheet. The write-off would only occur if and when ABN-AMRO would cease to be an independent bank (on the integration of the retail activities of ABN-AMRO into Fortis), but Fortis would then be in danger of no longer meeting the standards for capital required of banks. Another sore point was the loss on the sale of the business activities; as the sale was forced (because EU regulations) this was not effected at full value: a €300 million loss was reported on the sale. However, it later became known that although Lippens, the chairman of the Supervisory Board of Fortis had claimed to have moved heaven and earth at the EU (only stopping short of taking the EU to court) to get an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> so as to gain bargaining space (and a better price) it had not actually applied for an extension. Commissioner Kroes reported there had been no contact whatsoever. Lippens explained that it had been merely a figure of speech.|$|R
40|$|UNFCCC) (1) has laudable {{goals for}} {{greenhouse}} gas reductions. However, {{from the beginning}} of the negotiations, there were concerns (2) that the protocol might lead to a perverse incentive to increase the logging of pristine forests, which are large carbon pools and reported to be carbon sinks (3). The in-dustrialized countries that signed the Kyoto Protocol may reach their greenhouse gas re-duction commitments either by decreasing emissions or by promoting sinks of carbon. Land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) activities such as afforestation (4), reforestation, and land management are agreed ways to create such sinks. In 2001 (5, 6), it was agreed that reforesta-tion activities eligible for carbon credits would be limited to activity occurring on lands that did not contain forest on 31 December 1989. As the agreements leave room for renegotia-tion <b>of</b> this <b>time</b> <b>limit,</b> some countries are al-ready requesting its modification under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) (7).

500|$|Due to {{the cost}} of land purchases, the Met's eastward {{extension}} from Moorgate Street was slow to progress and it had to obtain an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the Act's <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> in 1869.

The first section opened to the Great Eastern Railway's (GER's) recently opened terminus at Liverpool Street on 1 February 1875. For a short time, while the Met's station was being built, services ran into the GER station via a [...] curve, the Met opening its station later that year on 12 July and this curve not being used again by regular traffic. During the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the railway to Aldgate several hundred cartloads of bullocks' horn were discovered in a layer [...] below the surface.

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} for construction projects to have applications for <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Many problems are encountered in practice in the application and preparation <b>of</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> claims.

Findings from the study revealed that local contractors usually fail to comply with the contract procedural requirements to submit timely notification of delay and have difficulty in demonstrating their entitlement for <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> The main problem faced by contract administrators is that contractors tend to "inflate" their <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> entitlement with the intention to maximise their claims. Adherence to the agreed procedure in preparing and evaluating of delay claims and the implementation of a set of agreed standardised delay analysis may help to minimize the frequency and impact of such problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficient}} and effective management <b>of</b> <b>time</b> on complex construction projects (especially when concerned with the development and resolution <b>of</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> claims) has long been considered {{a major issue in}} construction contracts. Recent research has culminated in the production of a new standard form of contract drafted specifically as an attempt to overcome these issues. This research identifies the perceived critical success factors that are recommended to be included in, and addressed by the new standard form of construction contract in an attempt to alleviate these issues, and reviews a selection of Australian standard forms of construction contract for the presence of the perceived critical success factors. A review of current literature was carried out to identify the perceived critical success factors for the effective and efficient management <b>of</b> <b>time</b> with respect to <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> claims, together with a qualitative analysis of the new standard form of construction contract as verification of the identified critical success factors and their management and application. A comparative analysis was undertaken <b>of</b> the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> provisions <b>of</b> a selection of Australian standard forms of construction contract as a means of determining their efficiency and effectiveness for resolving <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> claims in a modern construction industry. The research identified 69 critical success factors that should be present in the clauses of standard forms of construction contracts to efficiently and effectively enable the resolution <b>of</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> claims for the benefit of all parties involved. The selected Australian standard forms of construction contract were found to be vague with respect to the content and inclusion of the perceived critical success factors, providing a greater opportunity for an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> claim to evolve into a dispute between the contracting parties...|$|R
40|$|Typical {{consequences}} {{of child sexual}} abuse, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (‘PTSD’), prevent many survivors of this abuse bringing civil legal proceedings within the statutory <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b> On discovering {{the nature and extent}} of their psychiatric injury, or its connection with the abuse, survivors may apply to the court for an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to allow their claim to proceed. Outcomes of these applications often turn on judgments about the survivor’s knowledge of the injury and its cause, and about whether the survivor has taken reasonable steps to discover the nature, extent and cause of their injuries. Reported cases <b>of</b> applications for <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in this context are rare, but Queensland has an emerging body of decisions. These cases demonstrate that judgments about the issues of knowledge and reasonable conduct are made without considering evidence about the symptomatology of PTSD, especially the avoidance criterion. This article summarises the {{consequences of}} child sexual abuse, focussing on PTSD, before outlining the statutory provisions for <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Case studies <b>of</b> applications by survivors with PTSD to extend time are then synthesised. The psychological evidence is used as a standard against which to analyse judicial reasoning about survivors’ knowledge and ‘reasonable’ conduct. Finally, the question of whether PTSD can constitute a legal disability in the context of an application for an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> is addressed. Because similar questions are raised by extension provisions in nearly all Australian jurisdictions, the analysis in this article has implications for future cases in both Queensland and other jurisdictions...|$|R

40|$|Construction {{projects}} that require <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> {{is a common}} phenomenon throughout the world. A significant number of such construction projects encounter some form of delays {{in the process and}} hence, the time for completion would be typically extended. Yet, the pertinent question is whether such the granting or disallowance <b>of</b> such <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> is properly considered in light of the contractual background. The reality of this could be somewhat explained by the differing scope and complexity of the construction works undertaken in recent years. Increasing demands for more ambitious buildings or structures has inevitably led to construction designs that push the boundaries of the technical requirements involved. While the technicalities in the construction industry have been increasing in recent years, the development of law with regards to the application <b>of</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> has witnessed its own progression. The question therefore is whether the legal development moves in consonance with the practicality and commerciality required and expected from the construction professionals and to the industry itself. This paper will consider the approach taken in applying <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> clauses and the factors involved. This would necessarily require an examination of the legal principles in contractual interpretation to provide the necessary depth to the overall analysis. Thereafter, the scope <b>of</b> <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> within construction projects will be analysed from a legal perspective and the progression thereof is charted through the development of both statutes and case law. The term of reference would primarily draw from the Commonwealth jurisdictions given the dearth of approaches and case law that have emerged from this area...|$|R
