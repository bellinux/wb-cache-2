40|$|The {{sustainability}} of <b>effective</b> <b>researcher</b> development provision post-Roberts requires re-orientations of our thinking {{in a number}} of ways. Developers need to think from the perspective less of national policy and institutional organisation and more of the developing practitioner. Their autonomy needs to be the focus, understood in the positive, Kantian sense, freedom to explore new avenues of scientific and other enquiry and to direct their own development, underpinned by sense of value, individually and as a peer group. This emphasises the place of consciousness and reason in the development process. Both proponents and opponents of the skills agenda at this level are stuck in a realist mindset which demands critique. It promotes, on the one hand, an unhelpful deficit model of skills as discrete concrete requirements and, on the other hand, gives licence to the equally unhelpful challenge that skills and academic endeavour are worlds apart. This session provides opportunity for participants to explore the implications of these lines of thinking for practice and policy, especially {{with the advent of the}} new Researcher Development Framework...|$|E

40|$|Educating {{our early}} career {{researchers}} {{is becoming more}} complex. The range of doctoral degrees, the fast moving nature of knowledge, internationalisation, the demands of funding bodies and employers are all pulling on PhD supervisors. The untrained PhD supervisor will copy (or avoid copying) {{the way that they}} were supervised themselves. Current literature on PhD supervision focuses either on lists of tasks that the supervisor must undertake or on conceptions of research. There is a need for a conceptual approach to research supervision. This review of the literature relating to research supervision identifies six main concepts all of which contribute to our understanding. These are not competing concepts. Supervisors, supervisory teams and co-supervisors might use them to define or illuminate their practice. It is proposed that the range and depth of concepts that a supervisor holds will dictate how they supervise and the type of researcher who emerges {{at the end of the}} process.

40|$|Research {{training}} should facilitate <b>effective</b> <b>researcher</b> role development. While researcher roles {{require the}} performance of specialised knowledge and skill, they also require development of personal research identities within social contexts. Interaction with research peers can provide opportunities for reflective role development. Ad-hoc cohort-specific peer interventions are relatively common in research training, but these can lack standardisation and clear conceptual frameworks to underpin strategies. Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) provide a structured approach to peer support for learning. As such, we aimed to develop, implement and evaluate a PASS program for research trainees. Participants (N = 21; (9 male, 12 female; exercise science n = 5, biomedical science n = 7, science n = 2, public health n = 4, nutrition n = 3) were post-bachelor honours students and PASS was provided on a weekly basis. Demographic, academic, and PASS {{data were collected from}} institutional records. Students completed standardised PASS satisfaction evaluations. Standard undergraduate PASS administrative, funding, and reporting strategies were successfully applied. Leader selection, training, and PASS resource development processes were adapted for the research training context. Attendance and student satisfaction was high as was timely completion of research related assessments. PASS has been shown to provide methodological consistency and a transparent conceptual framework to frame expectations about the process, leader and participant roles, and mechanisms to evaluate impact. PASS enables institutionally sanctioned but peer driven opportunities for social exchange wherein reflective interpretive approaches to research role development can be considered...|$|E
40|$|Tinnitus is {{a common}} medical {{condition}} which interfaces many different disciplines, yet {{it is not a}} priority for any individual discipline. A change in its scientific understanding and clinical management requires a shift toward multidisciplinary cooperation, not only in research but also in training. The European School for Interdisciplinary Tinnitus research (ESIT) brings together a unique multidisciplinary consortium of clinical practitioners, academic researchers, commercial partners, patient organizations, and public health experts to conduct innovative research and train the next generation of tinnitus researchers. ESIT supports fundamental science and clinical research projects in order to: (1) advancing new treatment solutions for tinnitus, (2) improving existing treatment paradigms, (3) developing innovative research methods, (4) performing genetic studies on, (5) collecting epidemiological data to create new knowledge about prevalence and risk factors, (6) establishing a pan-European data resource. All research projects involve inter-sectoral partnerships through practical training, quite unlike anything that can be offered by any single university alone. Likewise, the postgraduate training curriculum fosters a deep knowledge about tinnitus whilst nurturing transferable competencies in personal qualities and approaches needed to be an <b>effective</b> <b>researcher,</b> knowledge of the standards, requirements and professionalism to do research, and skills to work with others and to ensure the wider impact of research.

40|$|The {{literature}} on treating substance abuse has dealt basically with four important questions: (a) Is treatment effective? (b) Are all programs equally effective?

This paper reviews the substance abuse treatment literature around these four questions and discusses methodological issues that hinder the interpretation and generalization of results to date. The answer {{to the first question}} is a sounding “yes,” treatment is effective but not all programs are equally <b>effective.</b> <b>Researchers</b> have moved beyond the “black box” literature that concentrated on patient and program characteristics as explanations for differences in effectiveness and search for the “active” ingredients of treatment.

30|$|We {{argue that}} for {{visualizations}} {{to be most}} <b>effective,</b> <b>researchers</b> need to integrate decision-making frameworks into visualization cognition research. Reviews of decision making with visual-spatial uncertainty also agree {{there has been a}} general lack of emphasis on mental processes within the visualization decision-making literature (Kinkeldey, MacEachren, Riveiro, & Schiewe, 2017; Kinkeldey, MacEachren, & Schiewe, 2014). The framework that has dominated applied decision-making research for the last 30  years is a dual-process account of decision making. Dual-process theories propose that we have two types of decision processes: one for automatic, easy decisions (Type 1); and another for more contemplative decisions (Type 2) (Kahneman & Frederick, 2002; Stanovich, 1999). 1 Even though many research areas involving higher-level cognition have made significant efforts to incorporate dual-process theories (Evans, 2008), visualization research has yet to directly test the application of current decision-making frameworks or develop an effective cognitive model for decision making with visualizations. The goal of this work is to integrate a dual-process account of decision making with established cognitive frameworks of visualization comprehension.|$|R
5000|$|Audio latency: Most {{musicians who}} {{play in a}} group rely on audio cues to {{maintain}} tempo and other communication. The most obvious example {{is the use of}} a drummer in pop music to keep time. In a normal rehearsal or performance environment, there is a delay between the time one musician plays and another hears the sound due to the speed of sound in air. This is typically from 3 - 50ms. When audio is transmitted through a digital medium (i.e. the Internet), the delay (or latency) can be much longer. Cell phones have latency of approximately 50ms. Applications such as Skype have approximately 100ms. And, QuickTime and Windows Media server-based streaming systems add 8 or more seconds of latency. When the latency is too high, the audio cues are no longer <b>effective.</b> <b>Researchers</b> [...] have shown that some musicians can ignore this delay while others find it obtrusive. In general, the higher the audio quality and the more channels transmitted, the higher the latency needs to be to reliably transmit the audio stream.|$|R

40|$|In {{seeking to}} {{determine}} whether climate change mitigation strategies are <b>effective,</b> <b>researchers</b> and policy-makers typically use energy consumption as an indicator. UK government data show that energy use amongst the public is rising, despite measures to encourage energy conservation. Yet, research to date has not explicitly asked which actions the public are taking with the express intention of mitigating climate change. Using Stern's classification of impact-oriented and intent-oriented behaviour research, the research described in this paper examines both actions taken ‘out of concern for climate change’ and energy conservation practices amongst the UK public. The findings show a clear divergence between actions prescribed by policy-makers (i. e. energy conservation) and those taken by the public to mitigate climate change (e. g., recycling). Furthermore, those who take action to conserve energy generally do so for reasons unconnected to the environment (e. g., to save money). Regression analyses highlight the distinct determinants of these two behavioural categories. These findings imply that surveys using energy reduction {{as an indicator of}} public response to climate change falsely assume that these can be equated; consequently, they will provide a distorted picture of behaviouralresponse. Possible reasons for the asymmetry of intentions and impacts, and policy implications, are discussed...|$|R
