5|$|St. Rynagh's National School (NS) caters for {{children}} between the ages of 4 and 12 and accommodates approximately 200 students. Secondary education is provided by Banagher College (Coláiste na Sionna), a multi <b>denominational</b> <b>school</b> under the responsibility of Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board. Banagher College is an amalgamation of La Sainte Union Secondary School and St. Rynagh's Community College. La Sainte Union is a voluntary Catholic School run by the Sisters of La Sainte-Union des Sacrés-Coeurs, a congregation founded in France in 1826 by Abbé Jean-Baptiste Debrabant to promote Christian education. The school was their first in Ireland and opened its doors in 1863 in a house on Main Street when the Abbé arrived with Mother Anatolie Badger and three sisters of the order.|$|E
5|$|The Free School of Milnrow {{was founded}} in 1726. From 1739 {{until his death in}} 1786 the {{schoolmaster}} was the caricaturist John Collier. Newhey Council School was constructed in 1911. Milnrow St James School evolved into the modern primary school, Milnrow Parish Church of England Primary. It is a <b>denominational</b> <b>school</b> with the Church of England, linked with Milnrow's Anglican parish church, St James's. There are further primary schools, in central Milnrow named Moorhouse County Primary and Crossgates County Primary, and at Newhey named Newhey Community Primary, all of which are non-denominational. Hollingworth Academy (formerly Roch Valley High then Hollingworth High and then Hollingworth Business and Enterprise College) is a secondary school in Milnrow. It is a co-educational school of non-denominational religion. Other learning facilities in Milnrow include a 1907-built Carnegie library.|$|E
25|$|Although the N.S.S. {{claimed to}} be interdenominational, the schools run by the Society became {{increasingly}} identified and involved with the Church of England. The Society acknowledged {{that one of its}} primary aims, despite its non-denominational constitution, was to carry the ministry of the Church to isolated areas which could not afford to support a clergyman. In 1923 they merged into a <b>denominational</b> <b>school</b> system known as the Church of England schools. The existence of the society was one of the influences in the evolution of a <b>denominational</b> <b>school</b> system in Newfoundland. The teachers sent out in the society’s early years were well trained and highly regarded as leaders within the communities in which they lived, and they usually served as catechists or lay readers as well. A considerable number later elected to become ordained as Anglican priests and furnished the Newfoundland church with one of its main sources of clerics during the 19th century. Regarding themselves as missionaries as well as pedagogues, they strove to inculcate the virtues of hard work, regular habits, sobriety, and the observance of Sunday as a day of rest.|$|E
40|$|Whether <b>denominational</b> <b>schools</b> {{should be}} {{funded by a}} liberal {{democratic}} state is hotly debated in contemporary political and educational philosophy. In this article we defend that on certain conditions <b>denominational</b> <b>schools</b> should be financed. Recently, important criticisms have been raised against this position. We argue that these criticisms give reason to refine and supplement our view but not to abandon it. In particular we reaffirm liberalism's commitment to autonomy. On {{the basis of our}} liberal educational view we formulate four conditions for the funding of <b>denominational</b> <b>schools</b> and describe the character of public schools. We conclude by sketching how in our liberal democratic society a differentiated educational system of public and <b>denominational</b> <b>schools</b> should look like...|$|R
5000|$|The exact {{point in}} dispute was {{the meaning of}} the phrase [...] "...by Law or {{practice}} in the Province at the Union," [...] used in s. 22(1) of the Manitoba Act. The Judicial Committee held that this provision did not itself create a system of <b>denominational</b> <b>schools.</b> Rather, it gave constitutional protection to whatever rights existed with respect to <b>denominational</b> <b>schools</b> in Manitoba in 1870. The Judicial Committee reviewed the historical record and concluded that in 1870, all schools in Manitoba were funded by the religious groups which ran them, and not by any system of public taxation. As a result, the Judicial Committee concluded that s. 22(1) simply guaranteed the right of religious groups to establish and run their own schools, at their own expense. It did not guarantee any public funding for <b>denominational</b> <b>schools,</b> since there was no financial tax support for <b>denominational</b> <b>schools</b> in 1870. Taxpayer funding for <b>denominational</b> <b>schools</b> was only established after the foundation of the Province and was not guaranteed by s. 22(1) of the Manitoba Act, 1870. The Legislature therefore could end taxpayer funding for <b>denominational</b> <b>schools</b> and instead establishing a system of taxpayer funded non-sectarian schools, without being in breach of s. 22(1).|$|R
50|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Province, the new provincial government established a system of <b>denominational</b> <b>schools</b> funded by provincial taxes. However, in 1890, the Manitoba government of Premier Thomas Greenway passed the Public Schools Act, removing funding for Catholic and Protestant <b>denominational</b> <b>schools</b> and establishing a system of tax-supported, non-sectarian public schools.|$|R
25|$|Since 1982, both parliaments {{have had}} {{to comply with the}} Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which constitutionalized a number of {{fundamental}} human rights and educational rights of minorities in all provinces (education is a provincial jurisdiction in Canada). Prior to this, Quebec was effectively the sole province required constitutionally to finance the educational needs of its linguistic minority. Ontario and Quebec are both required to finance schools for their principal religious minorities (Roman Catholic in Ontario, Protestant in Quebec), but only in Quebec is the minority almost completely composed of speakers of the minority language. (Quebec also provided English schools for anglophone Roman Catholics.) In 1997, an amendment to the constitution allowed for Quebec to replace its system of <b>denominational</b> <b>school</b> boards with a system of linguistic school boards.|$|E
25|$|Pennant Hills {{referred}} variously to {{the ridge}} from Dundas to Mobbs Hill, the quarry {{in what is}} now Dundas Valley and the Government wharf at Ermington (1817). Pennant Hills was used in naming the location of St Paul’s Church built on Mobbs Hill in 1850 and the associated <b>denominational</b> <b>school</b> which commenced around the same time. The school occupied purpose built premises next to the church from 1872 (demolished in the 1970s). When the new public school opened in the same building in January 1883 it was called Pennant Hills South Public School, changing its name to Carlingford Public School in 1887, shortly before moving into new premises across the road. By that date, the name Carlingford had become associated with the locality up to North Rocks and Pennant Hills referred to the area beyond. However, when the railway line opened from Clyde to the Carlingford district in April 1896 the station was called Pennant Hills (the station being on Pennant Hills Road) but was later changed to Carlingford in August 1901.|$|E
25|$|The Newfoundland School Society (N.S.S) was {{established}} on June 30, 1823 by a merchant named Samuel Codner. Codner {{first came to}} Newfoundland in 1788 and periodically traveled back to England where he {{was influenced by the}} Evangelical Revival occurring there during this time. He was inspired to help Christians in neglected British colonies by the Premier of England, Lord Liverpool in 1821. Knowing the dire conditions in Newfoundland, he formed The Society for Educating the Poor of Newfoundland which had its first annual meeting at the London Coffee House on July 13, 1824. It was the ability of the N.S.S. to deal with the difficult conditions in Newfoundland that led to their great success on the Island. The first N.S.S. school was set up in St. John's in 1823 and within two years, the demand spread rapidly to rural Newfoundland where petitions and applications for schools began pouring out. By 1825, five schoolmasters had been sent between St. John’s, Quidi Vidi, Harbour Grace, Carbonear, and Petty Harbour. Within just ten years, 43 N.S.S. schools had been established on the Island, with an enrolment of approximately 6945 children in daily schools and 4714 in Sunday schools. The N.S.S. began to dissipate in the late 19th century when Newfoundland Legislature established an Education Board and set up Board Schools across the Island, and especially after the Education Act of 1891. In 1923, what still existed as the N.S.S. merged into a <b>denominational</b> <b>school</b> system known as the Church of England schools.|$|E
2500|$|As Prime Minister, Bowell {{faced the}} Manitoba Schools Question. In 1890 Manitoba had {{abolished}} public funding for <b>denominational</b> <b>schools,</b> both Catholic and Protestant, which many thought was {{contrary to the}} provisions made for <b>denominational</b> <b>schools</b> in the Manitoba Act of 1870. However, in a court challenge, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that Manitoba's abolition of public funding for <b>denominational</b> <b>schools</b> {{was consistent with the}} Manitoba Act provision. [...] In a second court case, the Judicial Committee held that the federal Parliament had the authority to enact remedial legislation to force Manitoba to re-establish the funding.|$|R
5000|$|Denominational Particular Education ("confessioneel bijzonder onderwijs") {{refers to}} schools {{grounded}} in a religious denomination, often founded by or linked to church boards or religious foundations.

40|$|Almost {{everyone}} agrees that in a liberal democratic society the state should subsidize schools for compulsory education. The main reason is that compulsory education is a public and primary good that benefits both the individual and society. Also, many agree that public schools should be financed by the state. But whether <b>denominational</b> <b>schools</b> should receive subsidies from the state is hotly disputed. In the Netherlands and Belgium {{it can be said}} that <b>denominational</b> <b>schools</b> have a unique position because they are, just like public schools, fully funded by the state. Recently, however, this privileged position is more and more being questioned. Why should a liberal state contribute financially to schools that promote a specific religion or conception of the good? Doesn't this policy compromise the separation of church and state? And is it compatible with the liberal principle of state neutrality? In this article we describe three different views on the relation between liberal neutrality, primary goods, and the subsidization of <b>denominational</b> <b>schools...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Denominational</b> <b>schools</b> are an {{important}} provider of education in many countries around the world. Due to their focus, these schools often operate with multigrade classes, {{in which more than}} one age cohort is taught in one classroom. Multigrade classes are a cost-effective way to provide education and {{play a crucial role in}} education policy in the context of demographic change. This paper presents estimates of the causal effect of attending <b>denominational</b> <b>schools</b> with multigrade classes on schooling and short-run labor market outcomes. The analysis combines administrative records of schools with comprehensive population census data, and exploits the abolition of <b>denominational</b> <b>schools</b> in the Saarland, a German state, in 1969, for identification of the effect. The findings document significantly detrimental effects on final grade attainment, labor market participation and socioeconomic mobility. Notably, the negative impact is most pronounced in the outcomes of girls. Disentangling the confounding role of variation between Catholic and Protestant schools suggests that this effect might be driven by socialization early in life...|$|R
