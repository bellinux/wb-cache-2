40|$|Claims to the {{inadequacy}} of GDP growth {{as an indicator of}} well-being improvement are widespread. Yet the notion of well-being is very broad, hence difficult to quantify, so alternative indexes (e. g., ISEW, GPI) may also be deficient. This article approaches well-being from a multi-dimensional perspective which, unlike earlier attempts to incorporate inequality and environmental variables, focuses especially on â€œecological inequality,â€ 9 D or inequality in the distribution of the social cost associated with resource depletion. A methodology for assessing well-being improvements is developed, one which includes an accounting for <b>ecological</b> <b>inequality,</b> and is applied to four countries: Brazil, Costa Rica, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The variability in the results strongly suggests that in addition to depending on the subjective perspective of the policymaker regarding the relative importance of the income growth realized by different population groups, well-being assessments depend critically on the existing ecological distribution. More research into quantifying ecological distribution is therefore warranted. Absent significant progress in this area, sensitivity analysis such as that conducted here may inform policy better than GDP or alternative well-being indexes or aggregates.

Using the world-economy system as a theoretical lens, the paper raises a concern {{as to whether the}} way these global institutions frame bioenergy's role in developing regions manifests energy and <b>ecological</b> <b>inequalities</b> between the core and the periphery, as well as creates internal contradictions that perpetuate unequal exchange embedded in the system. Simultaneously, these organizations frame Brazil as a semi-peripheral state that, while successful in finding a niche concurring with the core's demand for cheap energy and cost-effective decarbonization strategies, is not necessarily a suitable role model for the periphery's socio-economic development.

Using the UK as a case study I unpack the global socio-economic and <b>ecological</b> <b>inequalities</b> inherent in the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions on a territorial basis under the international climate change framework. In so doing, I problematise questions of distribution, allocation and responsibility with regards to the pressing need to reduce global GHG emissions and the consumption that generates them. I challenge the disproportionate emphasis that energy policy places on supply as opposed to demand, as well as its overriding focus on the national scale. Consequently I argue that any low carbon transition, in addition to a technological process, is also a geographical one that will involve the reconfiguration of "current spatial patterns of economic and social activity" (Bridge et al., 2013 : 331), as well as relationships both within countries and regions and between them...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOver 60 % of {{the world}} {{population}} lives within a 150 km belt from the coastline. These territories that combine classic urban characteristics and natural features (coast, beaches, salt marshes, biodiversity reserves) are fragile but also attractive for residence, leisure and retirement. They are characterized by an unequal repartition of amenities, services, jobs {{as well as by}} uneven real estate prices. This geographical and social context raises the issue of inequality in the capability of using urban spaces, which can need a regulation from public authorities (ESCR Global Environmental Change Program, 2001). A growing attention is paid by geographical research to uneven distribution of environmental properties. We propose to analyze environmental and <b>ecological</b> <b>inequalities</b> in the specific context of urban coastal areas {{in order to determine the}} influence of the coast on the structuring of this type of territories. Environmental and <b>ecological</b> <b>inequalities</b> can be defined as observed and perceived differences, in the relation between humans and their living environment, which can discriminate individuals or groups of individuals under 4 categories: territorial inequalities that refer to differences in the quality of territories and the distribution of population groups; inequalities in access to urban and environmental amenities that refer to unequal opportunities of mobility in the city, of access to spaces and public goods, as well as possibilities of choice of residence places; inequalities in nuisances and hazards exposure; inequalities in the capacity of action and interpellation of public authorities for the transformation of living conditions. The aim of our study is to analyze through a quantitative analysis to what extent, coastal cities have specific socio-environmental characteristics compared to inland cities and to determine if those specificities may reinforce the socio-environmental inequalities in coastal territories. Focusing on French medium sized urban spaces (between 100 000 and 200 000 inhabitants) we offer a comparative analysis of the spatial distribution of socio-environmental characteristics between coastal and inland urban areas. Then, still relying on this definition and on these indicators, we will focus on coastal urban areas. Multivariate analysis of data show that cities are divided into two groups: coastal groups and continental ones. Coastal urban areas are defined by a more touristic profile. The population is older and lots of equipment is dedicated to this population. The building and development dynamic is strong. Among coastal cities, it is possible to define different geographical profiles whose characteristics can be analyzed in terms of socio-environmental inequalities. Inland urban areas are defined by a larger proportion of social, cultural and education equipment. The population is dominated by working population but the entrepreneurial dynamic is lower. The surface of agricultural land is higher and the use of green transportation is more common. Finally the risks exposure is lower. In a context of growing attractiveness, politic options can play a central part in limiting the development of inequalities and managing the consequences of the attraction of the coastal part of the city and the associated socio-environmental inequalities resulting from the competition between groups of population...|$|R

It is based on three assumptions, which are for the most part ignored in liberal theories: an accelerating <b>ecological</b> interdependence, historical <b>inequality</b> in past resource use, and the 'growth of limits'. These assumptions create a conflict between intra- and intergenerational justice, which is ignored in liberal theories, but which sustainable development tries to solve.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Inequalities in {{progress}} towards achievement of Millennium Development Goal four (MDG- 4) reflect unequal access to child health services. OBJECTIVE: To examine the time trends, socio-economic and regional inequalities of under-five mortality rate (U 5 MR) in Nepal. METHODS: We analyzed {{the data from}} complete birth histories of four Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS) done in the years 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011. For each livebirth, we computed survival period from birth until either fifth birthday or the survey date. Using direct methods i. e. by constructing life tables, we calculated yearly U 5 MRs from 1991 to 2010. Projections were made for the years 2011 to 2015. For each NDHS, U 5 MRs were calculated according to child's sex, mother's education, household wealth index, rural/urban residence, development regions and <b>ecological</b> zones. <b>Inequalities</b> were calculated as rate difference, rate ratio, population attributable risk and hazard ratio. RESULTS: Yearly U 5 MR (per 1000 live births) had decreased from 157. 3 (95 % CIs 178. 0 - 138. 9) in 1991 to 43. 2 (95 % CIs 59. 1 - 31. 5) in 2010 i. e. 114. 1 reduction in absolute risk. Projected U 5 MR for the year 2015 was 54. 33. U 5 MRs had decreased in absolute terms in all sub groups but relative inequalities had reduced for gender and rural/urban residence only. Wide inequalities existed by wealth and education and increased between 1996 and 2011. For lowest wealth quintile (as compared to highest quintile) hazard ratio (HR) increased from 1. 37 (95 % CIs 1. 27, 1. 49) to 2. 54 (95 % CIs 2. 25, 2. 86) and for mothers having no education (as compared to higher education) HR increased from 2. 55 (95 % CIs 1. 95, 3. 33) to 3. 75 (95 % CIs 3. 17, 4. 44). Changes in regional inequities were marginal and irregular. CONCLUSIONS: Nepal {{is most likely to}} achieve MDG- 4 but eductional and wealth inequalities may widen further.

40|$|Understanding {{the drivers}} of the {{productivity}} of marine ecosystems {{continues to be a}} globally important issue. A vast body of literature identifies 3 main processes that regulate the production dynamics of fisheries: biophysical, exploitative, and trophodynamic. Here, we synthesize results from international workshops in which surplus production models were applied to 13 northern hemisphere ecosystems that support notable fisheries. The results are compared across systems, levels of species aggregation, and drivers. By applying surplus production models at single- species (SS), multi-species (MS), aggregated group, and full-system levels across ecosystems, we find that the different levels of aggregation provide distinct, but complementary, information. Further, {{it is clear that the}} triad of drivers contributes to fisheries productivity in each ecosystem, but the key drivers are system-specific. Our results also confirm that full-system yield is less than the sum of SS yields and that some MS and aggregate yields may lead to overharvest of some stocks if species groups are constructed without considering common productivity, inter-species, and en vironmental interactions. Several fundamental features emerge from this Theme Section including sigmoidal biomass accumulation curves across trophic levels, improvement of model fits by inclusion of environmental or <b>ecological</b> covariates, the <b>inequality</b> of system maximum sustainable yield (MSY) versus aggregated sums and SS sums of MSY, a 1 to 5 t km− 2 fishery yield rule of thumb, and the finding that tradeoffs among ocean use objectives may not be as harsh as originally thought.

Questionnaire interviews were used {{to collect data on}} self-rated health in the last 12 months, education, marital status, perceived control based on nine questions, and material deprivation based on availability of food, clothing and heating. For each population, two ecological measures of material inequalities were available: an inequality score estimated from the survey data as the distance between the 90 th and 10 th percentiles of material deprivation, and Gini coefficient from published sources. Data on 5330 men and women aged 20 - 60 were analysed. Prevalence of poor health (worse than average) varied between 8 % in Czechs and 19 % in Hungarians. The age-sex-adjusted odds ratio for university vs primary education was 0. 36 (0. 26 - 0. 49); odds ratios per 1 standard deviation increase in perceived control and in material deprivation were 0. 58 (95 % CI 0. 48 - 0. 69) and 1. 51 (1. 40 - 1. 63), respectively. The odds ratio for an increase in inequality equivalent to the difference between the most and the least unequal populations was 1. 49 (0. 88 - 2. 52) using the material inequality score and 1. 41 (0. 91 - 2. 20) using the Gini coefficient. No indication of an effect of either inequality measure was seen after adjustment for individuals' deprivation or perceived control.

This study aims to evaluate the utility of census data in measuring geographic {{inequality in}} access to drinking-water and sanitation. Methods Spatially referenced census data were acquired for Colombia, South Africa, Egypt, and Uganda, whilst non-spatially referenced census data were acquired for Kenya. Four variants of the dissimilarity index were used to estimate geographic inequality in access to both services using large and small area units in each country through a cross-sectional, <b>ecological</b> study. Results <b>Inequality</b> was greatest for piped water in South Africa in 2001 (based on 53 areas (N) with a median population (MP) of 657, 015; D?=? 0. 5599) and lowest for access to an improved water source in Uganda in 2008 (N?=? 56; MP?=? 419, 399; D?=? 0. 2801). For sanitation, inequality was greatest for those lacking any facility in Kenya in 2009 (N?=? 158; MP?=? 216, 992; D?=? 0. 6981), and lowest for access to an improved facility in Uganda in 2002 (N?=? 56; MP?=? 341, 954; D?=? 0. 3403). Although dissimilarity index values were greater for smaller areal units, when study countries were ranked in terms of inequality, these ranks remained unaffected by the choice of large or small areal units. International comparability was limited due to definitional and temporal differences between censuses. Conclusions This five-country study suggests that patterns of inequality for broad regional units do often reflect inequality in service access at a more local scale. This implies household surveys designed to estimate province-level service coverage can provide valuable insights into geographic inequality at lower levels. In comparison with household surveys, censuses facilitate inequality assessment at different spatial scales, but pose challenges in harmonising water and sanitation typologies across countries...|$|R
40|$|Cryptosporidium are {{parasitic}} protozoa that infect humans, domestic animals, {{and wildlife}} globally. In the United States, cryptosporidiosis occurs in an estimated 750, 000 persons annually, and is primarily caused by {{either of the}} Cryptosporidium parvum genotypes 1 and 2, exposure to which occurs through ingestion of food or water contaminated with oocytes shed from infected hosts. Although most cryptosporidiosis cases are caused by genotype 1 and are of human origin, the zoonotic sources of genotype 2, such as livestock, are increasingly recognized as important for understanding human disease patterns. Social inequality could mediate patterns of human exposure and infection by placing individuals in environments where food or water contamination and livestock contact is high or through reducing the availability of educational and sanitary resources required to avoid exposure. We here analyzed data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1999 and 2000, and related seropositivity to Cryptosporidium parvum to correlates of social inequality at the household and individual scale. After accounting for the complex sampling design of NHANES and confounding by individual demographics and household conditions, we found impaired household food adequacy was associated with greater odds of Cryptosporidium seropositivity. Additionally, we identified individuals of non-white race and ethnicity and those born outside the United States as having significantly greater risk than white, domestic-born counterparts. Furthermore, we provide suggestive evidence for direct effects of family wealth on Cryptosporidium seropositivity, in that persons from low-income households and from families close to the poverty threshold had elevated odds of seropositivity relative to those in high-income families and in households far above the poverty line. These results refute assertions that cryptosporidiosis in the United States is independent of social marginalization and poverty, and carry implications for targeted public health interventions for Cryptosporidium infection in resource-poor groups. Future longitudinal and multilevel studies are necessary to elucidate the complex interactions between <b>ecological</b> factors, social <b>inequality,</b> and Cryptosporidium dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{submitted}} to ISEE 2012 Theme: The Political Economy of Green Development By Rikard Warlenius PhD Candidate Human Ecology Division Lund University, Sweden 2011. 11. 24 Calculating Climate Debt. A Comparison and a Proposal The notion of climate debt has invoked widespread {{interest in the}} last few years. First conceptualized in 1999 within the Millennium movement for (financial) debt cancellation, it was from the start a bottom-up approach, elaborated within the social and environmental movements rather than by states or academia. Demands to repay the climate debt were raised by hundreds of organizations, mainly from the global South, in 2009 and later also by states such as Bolivia and the 49 Least Developed Countries. Climate debt should be seen {{as a part of the}} wider ecological debt, a concept that was first introduced by Instituto de Ecología Politica before the Rio Earth Summit 20 years ago. Both concepts share the virtue of switching the commonly perceived positions of debtors and creditors in the world economy. While most other approaches to quantifying <b>ecological</b> and climate <b>inequalities</b> have been developed by researchers and have quite rigorous methodologies, climate debt is more of an 'open access' concept and lacks a unified way of defining, conceptualizing and calculating. One of the main goals of the research project Environmental Justice Organizations, Liabilities and Trade (Ejolt) is to empower Environmental Justice Organizations (EJOs) by transfer of scientific methodologies. Ecological debt, including climate debt, is identified as one of the key concepts. According to Ejoltʼs description, “[t]here is a demand from international EJOs and also from government officials for the instruction of the methodology of such calculations in terms that activists and citizens can understand” (Ejolt 2010). In an attempt to respond to this demand, this paper discusses and compares several efforts to quantify climate debt and similar concepts by activist-researchers (Simms 2009, Khor 2010), NGO campaigns (FOEI 2005, Jubilee Debt Campaign 2007, Third World Network 2009), UN bodies (UNDP 2007, WESS 2009) and scholars (Botzen et al 2008, Paredis et al 2008, Srinivasan et al 2008, Goeminne & Paredis 2010). A “new” method is proposed that is in line with the definition that has emerged from the climate justice movement, is accurate and user-friendly. The climate debt of a country is thus calculated as its actual emissions over time minus its fair per capita share of a “safe”, sustainable level of global emissions. The formula, CDC = ECP–(SW*T*PopC/PopW) is to be understood as CDC (climate debt of country C), ECP (C's total emissions during the time period T), SW (a sustainable level of global, annual CO 2 -emissions that is absorbed by the ecosystems without damaging their functions), T (the time period of choice), PopC (population of C at the end of P) and PopW (world population at the end of T). The method (hence referred to as RWa) is similar to “Model 1 ” of Paredis et al. (referred to as EP), which arguably is more historically correct but requires significantly more data and calculations. RWa has a model bias compared to EP that results in greater climate debt (or smaller climate claim) for countries whose population – as a rate of world population – is decreasing; i. e. generally developed countries. This bias can largely be obviated by a simple methodological innovation whereby the mean value of the population rates of the country in the beginning and end of the time period is used instead of the end value (RWb). Differing assumptions however cause greater result differences than the formal construction of the models. While Paredis et al. propose a level of global, annual emissions at 9 GtCO 2, I suggest that long-term sustainability requires a level of 3 GtCO 2. In Table 1, the climate debt for Guatemala and Sweden 1990 - 2000 resulting from the models EP 9 (with a sustainable level of 9 GtCO 2), RWa 9, RWb 9 and RWb 3 (3 GtCO 2) is reported. Note that the model bias of RWa 9 is largely obviated in RWb 9. Table 1. Sweden's and Guatemala's Climate Debt/Claim 1990 – 2000 according to four models (MtCO 2) EP 9 RWa 9 RWb 9 RWb 3 Guatemala - 111 - 135 - 118 8, 2 Sweden 481 489 481 583 The stronger ecological concern of RWb 3 increases the climate debt of both Sweden and Guatemala; actually turning the latter’s climate claim into a debt if only counting for the period 1990 - 2000. An advantage of the RW-model, however, is that the debt over longer periods of time can be calculated relatively easily. In the elaborated paper, methods will be compared, results for more countries and region will be shown, the historical and theoretical foundations of the concept further described, and assumptions discussed in depth. Finally, I will make some suggestions on how the climate debt can be repaid...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} theorizes an ongoing, global, grand {{trend of}} geopolitical disintegration, in the Post-Cold War, and increasingly in post- 1989 time. The proposed paradigm {{may be useful}} to analyze redistribution of internal power within every state, from developed old Western powers, to new developed powers as China and India, well beyond the dissolved former real-socialist countries and the so-called failing states. The focus is on not empirical description of each local request of more autonomy, self-government, or even independence, but on the reached limits of the centuries-long and planet-wide integration process, from which the modern states and contemporary world have arisen, and that has now left room to a time of disintegration. This insight draws {{on a wide range of}} positions and contributions from International Relations theorists, along with other political scientists and scholars of geopolitics, anthropologists and sociologists, political geographers and economists, historians of colonialism and nationalism, experts of secession, critics of globalization and postmodern intellectuals, federalists and anarchists. * The first of the three parts of this study, is dedicated to an historical insight about the geopolitical integration process that had westernized and globalized the entire world. War, the state and expansionism, were not an inevitable destiny. Instead, a very small group of modern states, in competition and imitation amongst themselves, started a particularly steady conquering march on the planet. Their power expanded in intensity and extension for centuries and, with and because of the Industrial Revolution, culminated in totalitarian states and in total wars. * * The second part treats the social and national movements that have led to the end, in 1989, of the bipolar paramountcy of the two industrial superpowers, United States and Soviet Union. Along with the dissolution of blocs and states, a steady decreasing of states wars, crimes and violences, is registered and explained in the study. A slippery use of the word and concept of nationalism, particularly in post- 1989 geopolitical crises, is frontally attacked in this part, drawing from early works of Ernest Gellner and Tom Nairn. Under the umbrella term of nationalism, integrationist projects and their victims, colonizers and colonized, oppressors and resistants, are likely to be confused. An early intuition of Karl Deutsch about the social awareness and mobilization of people in post-totalitarian, post-industrial and post-colonial societies, is here crossed with the work about coercion, capital, inclusion and consent of Charles Tilly. Masses, once enslaved in industrialized obedience, have evolved in networks of active citizens – and netizens – able, in a less violent international system, to claim for more personal liberties but also, as communities, for social, economical, and geopolitical change. A theoretical conjecture is also presented in this second part: in the Post-Cold War, no old or new powers will be able to keep enough concentration of power, in order to compete for world domination. We have entered a permissive state of disintegration. Redistribution of power from center to peripheries, empowerment of federal units, multiplication of small states, may occur, from now on, because there is nobody and nothing capable of preventing it. From this geopolitical point of view, the 1989 is at the very beginning. While sharing certain premises of a well-known thoughtful article by Alexander Wendt, on the inevitability of a world state (2003), this work reaches a different conclusion. * * * In the third and last part, the scope and the nature of the break in the sameness of international life is explored, with normative purposes. History is not repeating, and integration prejudices along with integrationist projects should be overcome. Every state may substantially devolve powers to its internal authorities, or even breakup, and many new smaller states, or self-governing units within states, might come out. In this increasing number of polities, an overwhelming number of citizens may go well beyond electoral democracy and have direct access to power. They may coalesce around what Brian Ferguson defined an «identerest» complex: constructed identities and tangible interests, inextricably intertwined. Citizens and netizens demanding power on their own territories and disintegration of their states, are required to take care of citizenry's duties, not only citizenship's rights. A model of responsible, moderate, pragmatic, «princely citizenry», echoing Machiavelli and Gramsci, is here proposed. -|- Acquisitions of this study are bluntly offered as a contribution to political action in a time of geopolitical change, in which it would be important to rely on expertise, but also on compassion, and on a real interest in the historical and geographical, spiritual and material pathways that each local, concrete human community is pursuing. Western-led state-building hubris, for instance, should be put aside in Afghanistan and many other corners of the world, it is recommend by this study.
