2500|$|The S3 {{received}} the 2.2 L Type 912 engine. The Turbo Esprit had a wet sump engine {{with the same}} power and torque output as its dry sump predecessor. Interior trim was revised which, when combined with changes to the body moulds, resulted in more headroom and an enlarged <b>foot-well.</b> The Turbo Esprit retained the aerodynamic body kit of the Essex cars and featured prominent 'turbo esprit' decals on the nose and sides. The S3 gained the new larger bumpers but kept the simpler sill line and glazed rear hatch of the S2.2 body. Both cars came with [...] BBS alloy wheels.|$|E
2500|$|New Zealand Police {{officers}} do not routinely carry firearms; officers only carry OC spray (pepper spray), batons and tasers. The Diplomatic Protection Squad and Airport {{officers are}} the only officers who routinely carry firearms. The majority of New Zealand Police officers are trained {{in the use of}} the Glock 17 pistol and Bushmaster XM15 M4A3 Patrolman rifle and wear a holster attachment for the pistol to enable carriage of the firearm if necessary. Senior officers can approve carrying of these firearms located in stations if necessary. In addition, since 2012, frontline vehicles have had a locked box in the passenger <b>foot-well</b> containing a loaded and holstered Glock 17, and in the rear of the vehicle, there is at least one Bushmaster rifle secured in a case together with ballistic vests. The vehicles are fitted with glass break car alarms. Each officer in the vehicle carries a set of vehicle keys and a set of safe keys. [...] Officers are required to advise their supervisor or communications if a firearm is to be retrieved from their vehicle and carried. New Zealand Police are heavily armed in contrast to neighbouring Australian Police services that require carrying of handguns, however, do not equip their officers with rifles routinely issued to United States Police such as the Bushmaster.|$|E
50|$|Fully {{automatic}} {{climate control}} system (HVAC) with pollen and charcoal filters, three different ventilation modes (diffuse, medium and focused), the ability to adjust the <b>foot-well</b> temperature one or two steps warmer or colder {{than the rest of}} the vehicle and an optional separate rear-seat climate control.|$|E
50|$|In 1961 Global Marine {{started a}} new {{drillship}} era. They ordered several self-propelled drillships each with a rated centerline drilling of 20,000 <b>foot-wells</b> in water depths of 600 feet. The first was named CUSS (Glomar) II, a 5,500-deadweight-ton vessel, Costing around $4.5 million. Built by a Gulf Coast shipyard, the vessel was almost {{twice the size of}} the CUSS I, and became the world’s first drillship built as new construction which set sail in 1962.|$|R
50|$|Inside the Series III {{the changes}} were more evident. Rootes stylists {{completely}} redesigned the seats and interior panels and specified that they be trimmed in single colour vinyl with contrasting piping. For the first time, deep pile carpets were fitted as standard in the <b>foot-wells</b> (previous versions had rubber mats). The steering wheel, control knobs and switches were in black plastic instead of beige. The dashboard, instead of being, as in the earlier cars, padded metal and plastic, was covered in burr walnut veneer surmounted by a padded crash roll fitted with black-faced British Jaeger instruments.|$|R
5000|$|Sunfish was {{developed}} by Alcort, Inc. and first appeared around 1952 as the [...] "next generation" [...] improvement on their original boat, the Sailfish. In contrast, the Sunfish has a wider beam for more stability, increased freeboard {{and the addition of}} a <b>foot-well</b> for a more comfortable sailing position. Sunfish began as a wood hull design and progressed to fiberglass construction just a few years after its introduction.|$|E
50|$|Freewheeling was {{retained}} in the four-stroke variant, {{until the end of}} production and in the Saab 99 with the 1709 cc Triumph engine. A minor drawback to the freewheel, particularly for drivers unfamiliar with the Saab, is that it makes engine braking unavailable although it could be manually engaged or disengaged by a control in the <b>foot-well.</b> Fixed wheel engagement, using the foot, could be difficult, as it involved pulling a 'T handle' intended for manual operation.|$|E

50|$|Inside, the W221’s {{interior}} is also {{significantly different from}} the preceding model, even more dominated by leather, wood and metal. Where the W220 still had a fair amount of plastic fascias and switches, the W221 has replaced most of these by more luxurious materials such as wood, leather and metal. The interior features an instrument cluster with two large flat panel screens, one for the hard disk based COMAND system which includes the navigation screen and one replacing the analog speedometer by a graphical representation of it, which can display a range of additional information and can also be replaced by the Night View Assist display. Below the central COMAND screen are silver effect air vents, and a square, analog clock within the vents. Below the vents are metal tab switches with a black field behind them, to control the HVAC system (these functions are all also accessible via the COMAND system, which also offers access to some additional HVAC functions, such as <b>foot-well</b> temperature settings and air flow control).|$|E
