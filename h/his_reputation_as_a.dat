He joined the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study and he went on to teach diplomacy at several New England colleges. He and his wife Rebecca live in Princeton, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, Robespierre's impassioned {{defense of}} the march raised his public profile considerably. The episode gave him a lasting heroic status among the poissardes and {{burnished}} <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> patron of the poor. His later rise to become virtual dictator of the Revolution was greatly facilitated by his actions during the occupation of the Assembly.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> destabiliser of regimes, Houphouët-Boigny granted refuge to Jean-Bédel Bokassa, {{after the}} exiled Central African Republic {{dictator}} had been overthrown by French paratroopers in September 1979. This move {{was met with}} international criticism, and thus, having become a political and financial burden to Houphouët-Boigny, Bokassa was expelled from Côte d'Ivoire in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Like most Austrian generals of the French Revolutionary Wars, {{he joined}} the {{military}} as a young man, and served in the War of Bavarian Succession, in which he took part in its first action by successfully repelling a Prussian border raid, which earned him the admiration of the Empress Maria Theresa's son, Joseph. His continued success in the Habsburg border wars with the Ottoman Empire added to <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> commander.|$|E
5|$|On May 18, at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln's friends promised and {{manipulated}} {{and won the}} nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff.|$|E
50|$|His {{early death}} in 1917 {{when he had}} not yet {{attained}} the age of 30 left <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> accomplished playwright with a sense of unfulfilled potential.|$|R

5|$|Outside these countries, Bennett {{remained}} almost unknown as a musician, although <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> conductor led Berlioz {{to invite}} him to join his Société Philharmonique, and the Dutch composer Johannes Verhulst solicited {{his support for the}} Netherlands Society for Encouragement of Music. Davison's attempts to interest the French composer Charles Gounod in Bennett's music led to polite but sardonic responses.|$|E
5|$|Solidifying <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hard-driving and {{assertive}} leader, Shoup rose {{through the}} senior leadership of the Marine Corps, overhauling fiscal affairs, logistics, and recruit training. He was selected as commandant by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and later served {{in the administration of}} John F. Kennedy. He reformed the Corps, emphasizing combat readiness and fiscal efficiency, against what was perceived as politicking among its officers.|$|E
5|$|Such was the {{disappointment}} at losing the Ashes, Collins was stripped {{not only of}} the New South Wales captaincy but also that of his local club, Waverley. Former players, including his former Waverley captain, the influential Monty Noble, publicly criticised Collins' captaincy. Hunter Hendry, viewing the match from the stands, suspected Collins threw the match. Despite <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gambler, there is no material evidence that Collins ever fixed the result of any cricket match.|$|E
50|$|In the 1935 season, Smart,rapidly gaining <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{explosive}} hitter, hit six, six, four, six, six, four off of Hampshire's Gerry Hill at the Cardiff Arms Park.|$|R

5000|$|... "Flamel {{was a real}} person, and he {{may have}} dabbled in alchemy, but <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> author and immortal adept must be {{accepted}} <b>as</b> <b>an</b> invention of the seventeenth century." ...|$|R
5|$|Sunday {{also took}} {{advantage}} of <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> baseball player to generate advertising for his meetings. In 1907 in Fairfield, Iowa, Sunday organized local businesses into two baseball teams and scheduled a game between them. Sunday came dressed in his professional uniform and played on both sides. Although baseball was his primary means of publicity, Sunday also once hired a circus giant {{to serve as an}} usher.|$|E
5|$|Undeterred, McCudden made {{a formal}} {{application}} {{to become a}} pilot and fly on operations but it was rejected on the grounds he was too valuable to risk losing. <b>His</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mechanic had spread since his supervision in the unit had led to a record-low number of engine failures. He continued to fly as an observer despite the recommendation of his rejection letter.|$|E
5|$|Barkley's party loyalty in the governor's race {{made him}} a {{formidable}} candidate to challenge Stanley, who by 1924 had angered members of both party factions, but Barkley {{had spent most of}} his funds in his campaign against Cantrill, and {{he did not want to}} risk <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> party unifier by challenging a Democrat. Instead, he decided to rebuild his war chest to unseat Kentucky's incumbent Republican senator, Richard P. Ernst, in 1926. In the meantime, he refrained from using his influence in state races to avoid losing any goodwill with Kentucky voters.|$|E

25|$|Murdoch {{remained}} an employee {{and later a}} partner of Boulton & Watt until the 1830s, and <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> inventor has been obscured by the reputations of Boulton and Watt and the firm they founded.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{additional}} expense involved in re-shooting many {{portions of the}} film, Himanshu Rai replaced Najm-ul-Hassan with Ashok Kumar, who was the brother of Sashadhar Mukherjee's wife, as the hero of Jeevan Naiya. This marked the debut, improbable as it may seem, of Ashok Kumar's five-decade-long career in Hindi films. Najm-ul-Hassan was dismissed from his job at Bombay Talkies (this was {{the period in which}} actors and actresses were paid regular monthly salaries by one specific film studio and could not work in any other studio). <b>His</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dangerous cad established, he could not find work in any other studio. His career was ruined and he sank into obscurity.|$|E
5|$|Griswold married Caroline on August 12, 1837, and {{the couple}} had two daughters. Following {{the birth of their}} second daughter, Griswold left his family behind in New York and moved to Philadelphia. His {{departure}} on November 27, 1840, was by all accounts abrupt, leaving his job with Horace Greeley's New York Tribune, and his library of several thousand volumes. He joined the staff of Philadelphia's Daily Standard and began to build <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> literary critic, becoming known for his savagery and vindictiveness.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{had known}} that ruling against the {{government}} might harm his prospects of promotion. By {{the time of the}} case, he was already the most senior judge of his district. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit often summoned him to sit with that court to hear appeals, a task he found stimulating. In 1917, he lobbied for promotion to the Second Circuit, but the unpopularity of his Masses decision and <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> liberal stood against him. He was passed over in favor of Martin T. Manton.|$|E
50|$|Kennelly {{earned an}} AFL Rising Star {{nomination}} in round 19 of 2002, consolidating <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> upcoming young talent. He was second (behind Leo Barry) for rebounds (77) from the defensive 50-metre arc in 2004.|$|R
50|$|He won the 55th Naoki Award for {{his novel}} Shiroi keshi (“White Poppy”, 1965). He also {{declined}} the Akutagawa Prize twice, {{as he felt}} that the reward would damage <b>his</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> author of serious literature.|$|R
