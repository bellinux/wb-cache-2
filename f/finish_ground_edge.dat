The most appropriate grinding conditions were obtained by clarifying wear process of grinding wheel and <b>finished</b> <b>ground</b> surface quality. When grinding was carried out up to stock removal 7000 mm 3 /mm, radial wear of grinding wheel ∆R is 3 µm and surface roughness Rz was 0. 5 µm or less. The grinding ratio Gr becomes about 3000, and long life grinding with little change of surface roughness was possible...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Gentex Corporation is {{developing}} a new style of interior rear-view mirror where the substrate sits proud of the mirror housing. Federal regulations require at least a 2. 5 mm radius of curvature {{around the perimeter of}} the substrate, and a grinding operation has been determined to form the radius in the substrate. During the process development, scratches have been observed along the surface of the <b>ground</b> <b>edge.</b> The purpose of this study was to utilize design of experiment (DOE) techniques to determine the process parameters that most significantly affected the presence of the scratches. METHODS: Feed rate, tool speed, and tool rotational direction were tested using a 23 full factorial design with two replicates. A vertical CNC and a diamond abrasive tool were used to form the <b>ground</b> <b>edge</b> into the substrate. Surface scratches on the ground surface were measured using an optical microscope. ANALYSES: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the data from the study. The response variable was the number of scratches present on a ground substrate. RESULTS: Using a significance level of α = 0. 05, the only significant factor that affected the presence of the surface scratches was the tool rotational direction with a p-value of 0. 013. It was determined that up-grinding produced less surface scratches than down-grinding. There were no significant interactions between factors. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that tool rotational direction significantly affected the number of surface scratches on a substrate, and the feed rate and tool speed were insignificant. To reduce the occurrence of the surface scratches, up-grinding should be employed...|$|R

The proposed method takes a 'design crack' as the basis for design, rather than an allowable stress, as in current approaches with which it is compared. This paper deals with the determination of the strength of glass elements; it does not address buckling problems, nor does it consider the concepts of alternative load paths. The role of crack size design within the wider philosophy of limit state design is discussed...|$|R

The plots appear as straight lines (due to power-law behavior) with slopes of 0. 50 for the peak current, 1. 00 for the charge released, 1. 49 for the energy and 0. 55 for the pulse duration.

40|$|Human caliciviruses (HuCVs) cause {{waterborne}} {{outbreaks of}} gastroenteritis. Standard indicators of a safe water supply do not adequately predict contamination of water by viruses, including HuCVs. We developed {{a method to}} concentrate and detect HuCVs in water samples by using a cultivable primate calicivirus (Pan- 1) as a model. Viable Pan- 1 was seeded in different types of water and then filtered with a 1 MDS filter, eluted with beef extract (BE), and reconcentrated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. The viruses in the final samples were tested by plaque assay or by reverse transcription (RT) -PCR following extraction of the RNA with Trizol. Pan- 1 was more sensitive to high-pH treatment than poliovirus was; a pH 9. 0 BE solution was found to recover 35 % more viable Pan- 1 than a pH 9. 5 BE solution recovered. Pan- 1 was recovered from small volumes of deionized, <b>finished,</b> <b>ground,</b> and surface waters at efficiencies of 94, 73, 67, and 64 %, respectively, when samples were assayed after elution without further concentration. When larger volumes of water (up to 40 liters) were tested after elution and concentration with PEG, 38, 19, and 14 % of the seeded Pan- 1 were recovered from <b>finished,</b> <b>ground,</b> and surface waters, respectively. The limit of detection of Pan- 1 by RT-PCR {{was estimated to be}} 0. 75 to 1. 5 PFU in 40 liters of finished water. This method may be adapted for monitoring HuCVs in drinking water and other types of water for public health safety...|$|R
