5000|$|Researchers Jay F. Kirkpatrick and Patricia M.

5000|$|In England the {{spelling}} {{of the name}} has many variant spellings, including Peace, Paice, Pase, Payce, and others. The surname {{dates back to the}} early 13th century and early examples of the recordings include Roger Pays in the 1275 Hundred Rolls of Norfolk, William Pace in 1242 in the Book of Fees for Devon, and Peter Pece of Yorkshire in 1302. Examples from parish registers include the marriage of Alice Pace to Thomas Picket in 1539 at St. Michael Bassishaw, and Alyse Paice who married John <b>Garrot</b> on August 16, 1573 at the church of St. Lawrence Pountney, both in the City of London. As a name in England, Pace has at least two possible origins. The first is from an early medieval nickname for a mild-mannered and even-tempered man, derived from the Anglo-Norman-French and Middle English word [...] "pace" [...] or [...] "pece", ultimately from the Latin [...] "pax" [...] or [...] "pacis", meaning [...] "peace". The second possible origin is from the result of confusion with the personal name [...] "Pash" [...] or [...] "Pask(e)", used frequently in medieval England as both a Christian name and as a nickname for a person born at Easter, or one having some other connection with that festival, such as a feudal obligation to provide a service, or make a payment, on that date.|$|E
40|$|An {{automated}} {{method to}} derive habitat preferences of wildlife in GIS and telemetry studies: A flexible software tool {{and examples of}} its application 1 By E HLrETrMAt, ~ and JULIA LINKE, Calgary 1 Introduct ion In order to conserve wildlife species effectively, {{it is crucial to}} know their habitat prefer-ences (e. g. AEBISCHEP, et al., 1993). However, in most cases it is very difficult o infer which habitat wildlife really needs. Although the application of telemetry and GIS have widely improved our knowledge in which habitat he animals are to be found (e. g. WHrZ ~ and <b>GARROT,</b> 1990; HOOGE and EICHENL^UB, 1997), it still presents a difficult ask to know what he true habitat preferences ofthe studied wildlife species are (e. g. MOaRISON, 2001). Only when the habitat preferences are known and quantified one can effectively manage these specific habitats, and, thus try to safeguard the habitat and its wildlife species of con-cern. The international and statistical wildlife research literature has addressed these issues for a long time.

40|$|International audienceOrganic-inorganic hybrid perovskites are {{promising}} absorber materials for low-cost photovoltaic solar cells or optoelectronic devices [1 - 4]. Among these perovskites, methylammonium triiodideplumbate (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3, MAPbI 3 or MAPI) exhibits currently the highest efficiency. Here we have analyzed the structural transition in MAPI by X-ray diffraction at the β phase {{and we have}} correlated it to its electronic properties. Despite all the extensive work on hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskites, their experimental band structure measured with k-resolution has remained elusive. Such an experimental determination is a necessary requirement for an accurate theoretical description {{and understanding of the}} system. The impact of the structural phase transitions on the band structure in the operation temperature range of solar cells needed also to be elucidated. Herein, we present the experimental determination of the band structure of MAPI with k resolution by angle-resolved photoemission at 170 K [5]. Our results show that the spectral weight is strongly affected by the cubic symmetry although traces of the tetragonal band structure are appreciated. Some deviations with respect to theoretical calculations are observed, which may help to reach a more precise description of this paradigmatic system of the hybrid perovskite family. On a second step, we have studied the relaxation dynamics after photoexcitation, particularly important in a photovoltaic material. Time-resolved two-photon photoemission spectroscopy allows to directly visualize the electronic cooling at early delay times. It follows that photoexcited carriers thermalize on a subpicosecond timescale, presumably because of the coupling to the vibrations of organic cations [6].

40|$|International audienceAIM: Exercise {{training}} {{is known to}} improve endothelium-dependent relaxation in the coronary and skeletal muscle arteries. However, the effects of exercise training on peripheral nonworking tissue, including microcirculation, are still unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effect of chronic and regular aerobic exercise on cutaneous microvascular endothelial function in rats. METHODS: We assessed the effect of physical training on skin microcirculation in 7 sedentary (SED) and 21 training rats (Wistar-Kyoto), submitted to a treadmill training protocol (15 m/min; 15 % incline; 60 min/day; 8 weeks). Training rats were divided into 3 groups, exercising 1 day/week (Ex 1), 3 days/week (Ex 3) or 5 days/week (Ex 5). Cutaneous blood flow was recorded {{before the beginning of}} the training protocol, after 4 weeks {{and at the end of}} the training program. Hyperemic response (RH) was the flow reaction obtained after sudden release of the <b>garrot.</b> For data analysis, cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) was indexed as cutaneous blood flow divided by mean arterial blood pressure (in millimeters of mercury, mmHg) and normalized to baseline values. RESULTS: At baseline, CVC was not different among groups (SED or training) at 3 steps of experimental protocol. The hyperemic stimulus significantly increased normalized CVC only in group Ex 3 after 4 weeks (P< 0. 006) and 8 weeks (P< 0. 006). CONCLUSION: Exercise training exerts a generalized effect on the vasculature by increasing endothelial function in vessel beds different from those perfusing actively working muscle. However, some differences exist since training at a frequency of 3 bouts weekly only modifies cutaneous microcirculation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{delocalized}} pi-electronic {{system of}} carbon nanotubes {{allows them to}} link non-covalently to a large variety of organic molecules. In contrast to covalent functionalization, this mild interaction preserves most of the intrinsic nanotubes properties (photoluminescence, mobility [...] .) but still leads to a strong enough coupling so to give stable supramolecular assemblies and to induce new and efficient functionalities [1]. We focus on nanotubes / chromophores compounds where the latter acts as a nano optical antenna that absorbs light and then transfer almost 100 % of the energy to the nanotube [2, 3, 4, 5]. Compounds made of different chromophores such as metal- or free base porphyrins, porphyrin polymers, and cyanines were synthesized {{by means of the}} micelle swelling method [1, 7, 8]. Energy transfer was analysed both on ensembles [5, 6] and at the single compound level [9]. We will first discuss the energy transfer mechanisms in these kinds of supramolecular assemblies [5 - 9]. In a second part, we will show that the new functionalities created by the molecules allow to gain new insight into the intrinsic electronic properties of nanotubes [10]. References [1] C.
