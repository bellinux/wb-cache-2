The largest group consists of those that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and possess significant potential for <b>interactions</b> <b>with</b> other drugs. The other group comprises those that are metabolized through glucuronidation, such as lorazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam, and, in general, have few drug interactions.|$|E
