In this paper, we present a physically aware design flow for mapping high level application specifications to a synthesizable register transfer level hardware description. We study the problem of optimizing the data communication of the variables in the application specification. Our algorithm uses floorplan information that guides the optimization. We develop a simple, yet effective, incremental floorplanner to handle the perturbations caused by the data communication optimization. We show that the proposed techniques can reduce the wirelength of the final design, while maintaining a legal floorplan with the same area as the initial floorplan. 1...|$|R

50|$|In general, {{grade of}} service (GoS) is {{measured}} by looking at traffic carried, traffic offered and calculating the traffic blocked and lost. The proportion of lost calls is the measure of GoS. For cellular <b>circuit</b> <b>groups</b> an acceptable GoS is 0.02. This means that two users of the <b>circuit</b> <b>group</b> out of a hundred will encounter a call refusal during the busy hour {{at the end of}} the planning period. The grade of service standard is thus the acceptable level of traffic that the network can lose. GoS is calculated from the Erlang-B formula, as a function of the number of channels required for the offered traffic intensity.|$|R

40|$|The {{alternating}} {{and continuous}} circuits produced {{different types of}} lesions in the central nervous system. Hemorrhages were common after alternating current shocks and few hemorrhages were observed in the continuous <b>circuit</b> <b>group.</b> With both types of circuits at 1000 and 500 volts potential, severe abnormalities in the nerve cells were observed. These were more marked in the continuous <b>circuit</b> <b>group.</b> A uniformly staining, shrunken, pyknotic nucleus was taken as a criterion of nerve cell death. The Purkinje cells of the cerebellum were most susceptible to the current. Injured cells were studied in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus, in the somatic motor group, among the primary sensory neurones and in the olives. Changes in the histological structure of the cells in reference to recovery have been discussed. Injury to the cerebral and cerebellar cortices occurred on the dorsal surface close to the head electrode. Small cavities were produced, particularly in the cerebral cortex, {{as the result of}} the circuit contact. With the continuous and alternating circuits at 110 and 220 volts potential less severe changes were observed in the nerve cells although hemorrhages were common in the alternating <b>circuit</b> <b>group.</b> It must be assumed in these cases that death was due to respiratory block rather than actual death of the cells...|$|R
