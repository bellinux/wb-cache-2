5|$|Scarlett and Rhett visit Melanie, who has {{suffered}} complications arising {{from a new}} pregnancy, on her deathbed. As Scarlett consoles Ashley, Rhett returns to their home in Atlanta; realizing that Ashley only ever truly loved Melanie, Scarlett dashes after Rhett to find him preparing to leave for good. She pleads with him, telling him she realizes now that she has loved him all along and that she never really loved Ashley, but Rhett says that with Bonnie's death went any chance of reconciliation. Scarlett begs him to stay but Rhett rebuffs her and walks out the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the early morning fog, leaving her weeping on the staircase and vowing to one day win back his love.|$|E
500|$|In 1890s London, magician Robert Angier {{performs}} his trick, [...] "The Real Transported Man" [...] to a {{sold out}} theater. Rival magician Alfred Borden sneaks under the stage. At the trick's culmination, Angier drops through a trap <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> a waiting water tank, where Borden watches him drown.|$|E
500|$|After a {{dramatic}} Atlantic Ocean recovery, Commander Shepard observed that he [...] "...didn't really feel {{the flight was}} a success until the recovery had been successfully completed. It's not the fall that hurts; it's the sudden stop." [...] Splashdown occurred with an impact comparable to landing a jet aircraft on an aircraft carrier. A recovery helicopter arrived after a few minutes, and [...] the capsule was lifted partly {{out of the water}} to allow Shepard to leave by the main hatch. He squeezed out of the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> a sling hoist, and was pulled into the helicopter, which flew both the astronaut and spacecraft to the aircraft carrier [...] The whole recovery process took just eleven minutes. Shepard was celebrated as a national hero, honored with ticker-tape parades in Washington, New York and Los Angeles, and received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President John F. Kennedy. He was also awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E

2500|$|Unable {{to perform}} in the San Francisco area, the play moved to Los Angeles, where the play's attempt at a run was {{disrupted}} by the arrest of both Dixon and Bright at curtain down of fourteen consecutive performances. McClure recalls, [...] "The actor and the actress actually got two standing ovations, one {{at the end of}} the play and the second when the police hauled them out of the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the waiting wagon and took them off to book them." ...|$|E
60|$|She led him {{out at the}} <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> {{the little}} garden, where they stopped.|$|E
60|$|The man slunk {{out of the}} <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> {{the passage}} like a wild animal {{returning}} to the night and darkness. Brooks took up the paper, rejoined Mrs. Wade in the parlor, and laid it before her.|$|E
60|$|With a {{dexterous}} motion {{she opened}} the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> sprang <b>into</b> the seat beside him.|$|R

6000|$|As he {{rose with}} {{elaborate}} boarding-house apologies {{to the room}} at large for going, and a cheerful but not intimate [...] "Good night" [...] to Istra, she {{followed him to the}} <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the dark long hallway without.|$|E
60|$|On {{through the}} passageways he trotted, {{past the first}} door and through the {{treasure}} vault; past the second <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the long, straight tunnel {{that led to the}} lofty hidden exit beyond the city. Jane Porter was still unconscious.|$|E
60|$|The skipper {{gazed at}} her for a moment in {{open-mouthed}} horror, and then jamming his hat firmly over his brows, stumbled out of the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the street, where he ran full into the arms of another mariner who was just entering.|$|E
60|$|There {{was no more}} to be said on the landing. We {{unlocked}} the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> went <b>into</b> the room.|$|R
50|$|Rogo {{leads the}} {{remaining}} survivors—Rosen, Martin, Nonnie, Susan, and Robin—through the watertight <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the propeller shaft tunnel. They hear a noise from outside and bang on the hull to attract attention. The rescuers cut {{a hole through}} the hull, assist the sole group of six survivors from the ship, and fly them to safety.|$|R
25|$|In 1991, the 960 {{introduced}} the first {{three-point seat belt}} for {{the middle of the}} rear seat and a child safety cushion integrated in the middle armrest. Also in 1991, it {{introduced the}} Side Impact Protection System (SIPS) on the 700, 940/960 and 850 models, which channels the force of a side impact away from the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the safety cage.|$|R
60|$|Together {{they helped}} the sick {{man to the}} <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the doctor's car, {{and in a few}} minutes Kauffman was {{stretched}} upon a good bed in a pleasant room. With a deep sigh of relief he laid his head upon the soft pillow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, she walked," [...] {{said the}} widow, {{interrupting}} him; [...] "she walked, quiet and asy, {{out of your}} <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> mine. But that's a lie, for {{it was out of}} her own. She didn't come through the kay-hole, nor yet out of the window." ...|$|E
60|$|They hurried {{around to}} the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the cottage. Alas! a single glance around was enough. Fully half the panes of glass in the cottage were smashed, and on the floors of the various rooms lay a dozen stones {{as big as a}} man's hand.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mechanics}} of the DisneySea tower are identical {{to those of the}} Californian and Parisian towers, with dual loading floors, horizontal push-back from the <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the drop tower, a [...] "hallway" [...] scene, and a mirror scene, but with thematic changes. The order of the mirror and hallway scenes is reversed compared to the American and European counterparts.|$|R

60|$|Presently {{the stove}} opened, sliding out {{a tray of}} {{steaming}} dishes. The mechanism clicked off, dying into silence. Steven grabbed up {{the contents of the}} tray, filling his arms. He carried everything down the hall, out the emergency <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the yard. The yard was dark. Steven felt his way carefully along.|$|E
60|$|And {{now we need}} {{no longer}} grope. It was a race along the passage and up the winding stair, through the second <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the stone-flagged {{corridor}} of the Castle of Grosbois, with the oil-lamp still burning {{at the end of}} it. A frightful cry--a long-drawn scream of terror and of pain--rang through it as we entered.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked up}} from my work. Through the camera of my jealously guarded window I could {{catch a glimpse of}} the vivid, quivering blue of the sky, the {{glittering}} intensity of the ocean, the long motionless leaves of the horse-chestnut in the road,--all utterly inconsistent with anything as active as this lamentation. I stepped to the open <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the silent hall.|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, a heavy {{footfall}} {{was heard}} without, and the portly knight flung open the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> strode <b>into</b> the room.|$|R

6000|$|... "Away they went, and I {{was just}} {{wondering}} whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were {{sticking out of the}} buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.|$|E
60|$|It used {{at first}} {{to be quite a}} matter of {{difficulty}} {{to know what to do}} with the frogs after they were caught; but after a time a covered basket was kept outside the <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> this the frogs were popped, and taken once a day and emptied into the stream. At first they had got into the well, and had proved a great nuisance; and they were only got rid of by nearly emptying the well out with buckets, and by then building a wall round its mouth, with a tightly-fitting lid.|$|E
60|$|Like a wild {{creature}} driven forth {{he started}} to run down the stairs, past the concierge, who was just entering his lodge, and who now turned in surly anger to watch this man running away like a lunatic or a fool, out by the front <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the street. In a moment {{he was out of}} the little square; then like a hunted hare he still ran down the Rue St. Honore, along its narrow, interminable length. His hat had fallen from his head, his hair was wild all round his face, the rain weighted the cloak upon his shoulders; but still he ran.|$|E
