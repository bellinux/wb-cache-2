5|$|In early September, Prinz Eugen {{supported}} a {{failed attempt to}} seize the fortress island of Hogland. The ship then returned to Gotenhafen, before escorting a convoy of ships evacuating German soldiers from Finland. The convoy, consisting of six freighters, sailed on 15 September from the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia,</b> with the entire Second Task Force escorting it. Swedish aircraft and destroyers shadowed the convoy, but did not intervene. The following month, Prinz Eugen returned to gunfire support duties. On 11 and 12 October, she fired in support of German troops in Memel. Over the first two days, the ship fired some 700 rounds of ammunition from her main battery. She returned on the 14th and 15th, after having restocked her main battery ammunition, to fire another 370 rounds.|$|E
5|$|The Lancasters' {{flight to}} Yagodnik {{initially}} went well. After departing their bases, the 39 aircraft flew {{north to the}} Shetlands before turning east. During {{the early stages of}} the flight one of the No. 9 Squadron Lancasters was forced to dump its Tallboy into the North Sea after it became decoupled from its mounting; the bomber subsequently returned to base. The remaining aircraft passed over neutral Sweden where the aircrew, most of whom had only conducted night flying over countries observing blackouts, were pleased to see towns lit up. After crossing the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia</b> the Lancasters continued over Finland towards the USSR. Several aircraft were fired on by Swedish, Finnish and Soviet anti-aircraft defences, but only one suffered any damage.|$|E
5|$|Västerbotten {{received}} arms {{in preparation}} for Gustav Vasa's funeral in 1560. According to the Swedish Heraldry Society, the reindeer came to represent all lands west of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia</b> at that time, and Västerbotten's coat of arms received its stars in the 1590s. Blazon: Azure, on a semé of stars Or, a reindeer springing argent armed gules. The modern Västerbotten County still bears these arms in the upper portion of a shield divided per fess, with the arms of Lappland and Ångermanland in the base, to illustrate the merging of lands from these two provinces into the modern county. Blazon: Party per fess, in chief the arms of Västerbotten, and in base party per pale the arms of Lappland (dexter) and Ångermanland (sinister).|$|E
25|$|The Baltic sea {{drainage}} basin is roughly {{four times the}} surface area of the sea itself. About 48% of the region is forested, with Sweden and Finland containing {{the majority of the}} forest, especially around the <b>Gulfs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia</b> and Finland.|$|R
25|$|About 20% of {{the land}} is used for {{agriculture}} and pasture, mainly in Poland and {{around the edge of the}} Baltic Proper, in Germany, Denmark and Sweden. About 17% of the basin is unused open land with another 8% of wetlands. Most of the latter are in the <b>Gulfs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia</b> and Finland.|$|R
50|$|By 12,000 BP {{the edge}} of the glacier was at a line across {{southern}} Sweden to the northern shore of the Baltic countries. A connected body of water, the Ramsay Sea, stretched from the Danish islands region to the shores <b>of</b> Estonia. The <b>Gulfs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia</b> and Finland were still glaciated, as well as nearly all of Sweden north of Scania. In the Allerød warm period, rising land in the Denmark region created the Baltic Ice Lake. It egressed through a small channel in the Strait of Øresund. The lake was higher than sea level (which itself was lower than the present-day sea level) by some tens of metres. Lake Ladoga was part of it.|$|R
5|$|Sweden {{had just}} lost one third of its population, as Russia had conquered the eastern part and created the Grand Duchy of Finland out of it during the Finnish War in 1808–1809. Shortly after, in 1814, the west flank had been secured by the {{personal}} union with Norway, and after the Napoleonic Wars, the former main enemy of Sweden in the south, Denmark, was no longer any threat. The only threat left was Russia, which now stood {{just across the border}} in the north, and had possession of the Åland Islands less than 150km from the Swedish capital Stockholm. The Swedish Navy was considered superior to the Russian in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia,</b> so a seaborne invasion against the coast of Norrland was not likely. And even though the Russians had invaded northern Sweden via Finland in the previous war, the general opinion was that in case of a new war, their main attack would be conducted towards Stockholm and southern Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Sweden is {{a country}} in Northern Europe on the Scandinavian Peninsula. It borders Norway to the west; Finland to the northeast; and the Baltic Sea and <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia</b> {{to the south and}} east.|$|E
25|$|The Åland Islands {{occupy a}} {{position}} of strategic importance, as they command one of the entrances to the port of Stockholm, {{as well as the}} approaches to the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia,</b> in addition to being situated near the Gulf of Finland.|$|E
40|$|Iron-manganese concretions, {{closely related}} to {{lacustrine}} ores and deep sea manganese nodules, are presently forming in different parts <b>of</b> <b>Gulfs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia</b> and Finland. They can be divided according to physical form into three distinct groups: (1) round pea-shaped concretions, (2) ring-shaped concrections, and (3) flat sheets and crusts of concretionary material. A definite correlation was found to exist between the form i. e. type of concretions and their chemical composition (Mn/Fe ratio). Trace element concentrations were generally rather high, although {{not as high as}} in deep sea manganese nodules. X-ray and DTA was used to study the mineralogy and crystal structure of the concretions. Surface concentrations and geographical distribution of the concretions were estimated on the basis of samples, diving observations and echo-grams...|$|R
5000|$|Originally only {{covering}} the North and Baltic Sea, as of 3 February 2008 the ASCOBANS Area {{has been extended}} to include also the Irish Sea {{and parts of the}} North Eastern Atlantic. It is defined as follows:"… the marine environment of the Baltic and North Seas and contiguous area of the North East Atlantic, as delimited by the shores <b>of</b> the <b>Gulfs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia</b> and Finland; to the south-east by latitude 36°N, where this line of latitude meets the line joining the lighthouses of Cape St. Vincent (Portugal) and Casablanca (Morocco); to the south-west by latitude 36°N and longitude 15°W; to the north-west by longitude 15°W and a line drawn through the following points: latitude 59°N/longitude 15°W, latitude 60°N/longitude 5°W, latitude 61°N/longitude 4°W; latitude 62°N/ longitude 3°W; to the north by latitude 62°N; and including the Kattegat and the Sound and Belt passages." ...|$|R
50|$|It is {{a special}} feature of Russia that it has few free outlets to the open sea other than on the ice-bound shores of the Arctic Ocean. The deep {{indentations}} <b>of</b> the <b>Gulfs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia</b> and Finland were surrounded by what is ethnically Finnish territory, {{and it is only}} at the very head <b>of</b> the latter <b>gulf</b> that the Russians had taken firm foothold by erecting their capital {{at the mouth of the}} Neva River. The <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> Riga and the Baltic belong also to territory which was not inhabited by Slavs, but by Baltic and Finnic peoples and by Germans. The East coast of the Black Sea belonged to Transcaucasia, a great chain of mountains separating it from Russia. But even this sheet of water is an inland sea, the only outlet of which, the Bosphorus, was in foreign hands, while the Caspian, an immense shallow lake, mostly bordered by deserts, possessed more importance as a link between Russia and its Asiatic settlements than as a channel for intercourse with other countries.|$|R
25|$|There is a {{decrease}} in faunal species from the Belts to the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia.</b> The decreasing salinity along this path causes restrictions in both physiology and habitats. The lack of tides has affected the marine species {{as compared with the}} Atlantic.|$|E
25|$|The Finnish Navy laid a {{total of}} ca. 1900 sea mines during the Winter War, of which Louhi laid about a third. It was {{involved}} most notably in laying mines in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia,</b> preventing the Soviet submarines from entering that area.|$|E
25|$|During the Finnish War, the Russian army {{unexpectedly}} {{crossed the}} frozen <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia</b> from Finland to the Åland Islands and, by 19 March 1809, reached the Swedish shore within 70km from the Swedish capital, Stockholm. This daring maneuvre decided {{the outcome of}} the war.|$|E
50|$|Coregonus albula, {{known as}} the vendace or as the European cisco, is a species of {{freshwater}} whitefish in the family Salmonidae. It is found in lakes in northern Europe, especially Finland, Sweden, Russia and Estonia, and in some lakes of Norway, the United Kingdom, northern Germany and Poland. It {{is also found in}} diluted brackish water in the <b>Gulfs</b> <b>of</b> Finland and <b>Bothnia,</b> both <b>of</b> which are in the Baltic Sea.|$|R

25|$|There {{are also}} daily ferry {{services}} from the Port of Turku to Sweden and the Åland Islands, operated by Silja Line and Viking Line.

25|$|With {{these reasons}} in mind, Kamensky {{suggested}} a daring plan, whereby the Russian army was {{to cross the}} frozen <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia</b> in two directions: one unit was to march from Vaasa towards Umeå and another from Turku to the Åland Islands and thence towards the vicinity of Stockholm. A third unit was to advance on Tornio and arrive in Sweden by land.|$|E
25|$|Freezing {{begins in}} the {{northern}} extremities of <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia</b> typically {{in the middle of}} November, reaching the open waters of the Bothnian Bay in early January. The Bothnian Sea, the basin south of Kvarken, freezes on average in late February. The Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Riga freeze typically in late January.

25|$|During the 1910s, Tarmo {{assisted}} {{ships to}} the port of Helsinki and moved to Hanko with Sampo after the New Year. As the spring approached, she was sent first to the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia</b> and finally to {{the eastern part of}} the Gulf of Finland to open the ports for the spring. However, during the winter months the icebreakers were not sent beyond Vaasa, partially due to the grounding of Tarmo outside Raahe in 1908.|$|E
25|$|The plan {{involved}} {{using the}} series of fortifications built after 1790 as staging grounds for the Russian advances into Finland. In southern Finland, armies were to isolate the fortifications and first {{take control of the}} whole of southern Finland before advancing further to the north. Forces in Savolax were to press hard against the Swedes and reach the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bothnia</b> towards Uleåborg and Vasa to cut off the retreat of {{the main body of the}} Swedish army.|$|E
