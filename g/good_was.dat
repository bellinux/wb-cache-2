5|$|A European {{tour with}} AC/DC {{in support of}} The World Needs a Hero began in mid-2001, {{followed}} by an American tour with Iced Earth and Endo in September. Mustaine allowed fans to choose the setlist in each American city. However, the tour was cut short following the September 11 attacks; all dates were canceled, including a DVD shoot in Argentina. The band instead played two shows in Arizona on November 16 and 17, which were filmed and released as Megadeth's first live release, Rude Awakening. That year, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is <b>Good!</b> <b>was</b> remixed and remastered; the reissue featured modified artwork and several bonus tracks.|$|E
5|$|After the Fatimid caliphs {{moved to}} Egypt, el-Mansuriya {{remained}} {{the capital of}} the Zirids, who became the local rulers, for the next eighty-five years. The Zirid ruler el-Mansur bin Buluqqin built a palace for himself at el-Mansuriya. There is a record of the lavish marriage in 1022-23 of his grandson, the young Zirid el-Muizz bin Badis. Pavilions were built outside the city, a large array of textiles and manufactured <b>good</b> <b>was</b> displayed and music was provided by a great number of instruments. El-Muizz bin Badis, who ruled Ifriqiya under the Fatimids from 1015 to 1062, rebuilt the Kairouan city wall and built two walls {{on either side of the}} road from Kairouan to el-Mansuriya. He ordered the transfer to el-Mansuriya of the crafts and commerce from Kairouan.|$|E
50|$|Complementary <b>goods</b> <b>are</b> a less extreme {{form of this}} effect. In this case, one <b>good</b> <b>is</b> {{still of}} value even if the other <b>good</b> <b>is</b> not obtained.|$|R
50|$|Unlike public <b>goods,</b> private <b>goods</b> <b>are</b> {{less likely}} to have the free rider problem. Assuming a private <b>good</b> <b>is</b> valued {{positively}} by everyone, the efficiency of obtaining the <b>good</b> <b>is</b> obstructed by its rivalry, that is simultaneous consumption of a rivalrous <b>good</b> <b>is</b> theoretically impossible; the feasibility of obtaining the <b>good</b> <b>is</b> made difficult by its excludability, that is people {{have to pay for it}} to enjoy its benefits.|$|R

5|$|Life Is <b>Good</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} by Def Jam Recordings {{and was also}} his last album for the label. It was first released on July 13, 2012, in Germany, where it reached number 24 on the Media Control Charts. In the United Kingdom, it debuted at number 8 on the Official Albums Chart, on which it spent three weeks. The album also debuted at number 2 in Canada and sold 5,700 copies in its first week there. In the United States, the album debuted at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200 and sold 149,000 copies in its first week. It was his sixth number-one album in the United States. In its second week on the Billboard 200, the album sold 45,000 copies. By February 10, 2013, the album had sold 354,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album charted for 16 weeks on the Billboard 200.|$|E
5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax used goods, {{some critics have}} argued that this would create a {{differential}} between the price of new and used goods, which may take years to equalize. Such a differential would certainly influence the sale of new goods like vehicles and homes. Similarly, some supporters have claimed that this would create an incentive to buy used goods, creating environmental benefits of re-use and re-sale. Conversely, {{it is argued that}} like the income tax system that contains embedded tax cost (see Theories of retail pricing), used goods would contain the embedded FairTax cost. While the FairTax would not be applied to the retail sales of used goods, the inherent value of a used good includes the taxes paid when the <b>good</b> <b>was</b> sold at retail. The value is determined by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The price differential / margins between used and new goods should stay consistent, as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods.|$|E
5|$|The caravan trade {{depended}} on patrons and merchants. Patrons owned the {{land on which}} the caravan animals were raised, providing animals and guards for the merchants. The lands were located in the numerous villages of the Palmyrene countryside. Although merchants used the patrons to conduct business, their roles often overlapped and a patron would sometimes lead a caravan. Commerce made Palmyra and its merchants among the wealthiest in the region. Some caravans were financed by a single merchant, such as Male' Agrippa (who financed Hadrian's visit in 129 and the 139 rebuilding of the Temple of Bel). The primary income-generating trade <b>good</b> <b>was</b> silk, which was exported from the East to the West. Other exported goods included jade, muslin, spices, ebony, ivory and precious stones. For its domestic market Palmyra imported variety of goods including slaves, prostitutes, olive oil, dyed goods, myrrh and perfume.|$|E

5000|$|After {{discussing}} the basic <b>goods</b> it <b>is</b> argued {{that within the}} list there is no hierarchal order, as the basic <b>goods</b> <b>are</b> considered impossible to compare or measure. Finnis believes the <b>goods</b> <b>are</b> equally self-evident. Each of the basic <b>goods</b> can <b>be</b> considered the most important, as none {{of them can be}} reduced to simply a mechanism of achieving another. While technically the <b>goods</b> can <b>be</b> treated as superior to one another Finnis provides that each <b>good</b> <b>is</b> still fundamental where no priority value exists.|$|R

5|$|The {{exterior}} {{consists of}} the two donor wings, a pair of saints, and two panels with Gabriel presenting himself to Mary. The donors are on the outer wings, kneeling in front of prayer books. Four imitation statues in grisaille make up the inner panels. The lower two depict Saint Sebastian and Saint Anthony. Sebastian was the saint of plagues and an intercessory against epidemics, Anthony {{the patron saint of}} skin diseases and ergotism, known in medieval times as St Anthony's Fire. The two saints had strong associations with the Burgundian court as well: Philip the <b>Good</b> <b>was</b> born on St Anthony's day, he had an illegitimate son named Anthony, and two of Rolin's sons were named Anthony. St Sebastian was the patron saint of Philip the Good's chivalric Order of the Golden Fleece, of which Rolin was a member.|$|E
5|$|Spreckels and his {{partners}} William G. Irwin and F. F. Low formed the Spreckels & Company Bank in Hawaii in 1884, for the specific purpose of circulating the silver coins. The first Hawaiian silver coin {{known to have been}} spent, a half dollar, was found among the receipts at the Honolulu Music Hall on January 10, 1884. It was placed in a pendant and given to the leading lady. The new coinage went into general circulation on January 14, with coins available at the Hawaiian Treasury and at Spreckels' new bank in Honolulu. There was considerable demand, and the coins (all of which were received by June 1884) displaced American quarter dollars and half dollars in circulation, something taken (depending on political position) to mean that they were accepted, or that Gresham's Law (bad money drives out <b>good)</b> <b>was</b> in operation. The Hawaiian Treasury had been almost out of cash before receiving the coins, and they entered commerce as the government paid for goods and services, increasing the money supply and risking inflation. Within six months of issue, the coins traded against American currency at a discount of 2 percent.|$|E
25|$|In 1943, the Lady Be <b>Good</b> <b>was</b> a new Liberator bomber {{that had}} just been {{assigned}} to the 514th Bomb Squadron on March 25. The squadron {{was part of the}} 376th Bombardment Group (Heavy) based at Soluch Field in Soluch in Libya. The plane, which had the AAF serial number 41-24301, had the group identification number 64 stencil-painted on its nose.

50|$|Fungibility is {{different}} from liquidity. A <b>good</b> <b>is</b> said to be liquid {{if it can be}} easily exchanged for money or another <b>good.</b> A <b>good</b> <b>is</b> fungible if one unit of the <b>good</b> <b>is</b> substantially equivalent to another unit of the same good of the same quality {{at the same time and}} place.|$|R
50|$|Digital <b>goods</b> <b>are</b> {{software}} programs, music, videos {{or other}} electronic files that users download exclusively from the Internet. Some digital <b>goods</b> <b>are</b> free, others {{are available for}} a fee. The taxation of digital <b>goods</b> <b>is</b> partially governed by a federal statute and has been the area of significant state legislative and rule-making activity.|$|R
50|$|A public <b>good</b> <b>is</b> {{one that}} {{everyone}} enjoys non-exclusively such as national defense or clean water. A private <b>good</b> <b>is</b> a <b>good</b> that <b>is</b> enjoyed exclusively by a select few, usually within the winning coalition, and cannot be shared. An {{example of such}} a <b>good</b> would <b>be</b> anything exclusionary, such as cash or legal impunity.|$|R
25|$|The {{official}} {{currency of}} the colonies was the British pound, but the unofficial currency and most readily accepted trade <b>good</b> <b>was</b> rum. During this period Australian businessmen began to prosper.

25|$|A genetic {{investigation}} into the remains of Rollo's grandson, Richard the Fearless, and his great-grandson, Richard the <b>Good,</b> <b>was</b> announced in 2011 {{with the intention of}} discerning the origins of the historic Viking leader. On February 29, 2016, Norwegian researchers opened Richard the Good's tomb and found his lower jaw with eight teeth in it. Unfortunately, the skeletal remains in both graves turned out to significantly predate Rollo and therefore are not related to him.|$|E

5000|$|In economics, {{the terms}} “public good” and “common good” have {{technical}} definitions. A public <b>good</b> <b>is</b> a <b>good</b> that <b>is</b> non-rivalrous and non-excludable.

25|$|Rome was {{essentially}} a landowning military aristocracy. From {{the early days of}} the Republic, ten years of military service were a citizen's duty and a prerequisite for election to public office. Devotio (willingness to sacrifice one’s life to the greater <b>good)</b> <b>was</b> central to the Roman military ideal, and was the core of the Roman military oath. It applied from highest to lowest alike in the chain of command. As a soldier committed his life (voluntarily, at least in theory) to the greater cause of Rome's victory, he was not expected to survive defeat.|$|E
25|$|In Roman law, {{usucapio}} laws allowed {{someone who}} was {{in possession of a}} good without title to become the lawful proprietor if the original owner didn't show up after some time (one or two years), unless the <b>good</b> <b>was</b> obtained illegally (by theft or force). Stemming from Roman law and its successor, the Napoleonic Code, adopted as the basis of law in France, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, and also, in part, by the Netherlands and Germany, adverse possession generally recognizes two time periods for the acquisition of property: 30 years and some lesser time period, depending on the bona fides of the possessor and the location of the parties involved.|$|E

50|$|Independent <b>goods</b> <b>are</b> <b>goods</b> {{that have}} a zero cross {{elasticity}} of demand. Changes {{in the price of}} one good will have no effect on the demand for an independent good. Thus independent <b>goods</b> <b>are</b> neither complements nor substitutes.|$|R
50|$|However, {{merit and}} demerit <b>goods</b> can <b>be</b> defined in a {{different}} way which makes it different from externalities. The essence of merit and demerit <b>goods</b> <b>is</b> to do with an information failure to the consumer. This arises because consumers do not perceive quite how good or bad the <b>good</b> <b>is</b> for them: either {{they do not have the}} right information or lack relevant information. With this definition, a merit <b>good</b> <b>is</b> defined as <b>good</b> that <b>is</b> better for a person than the person who may consume the good realises.|$|R
