In January 1966, attorney and land developer Charles W. Hinman {{was arrested and}} charged with plotting to have Chotiner murdered. Chotiner had represented Hinman's wife in a contested divorce case, and Hinman had been jailed for eleven days for failure to pay his fees. No actual attempt on his life took place. Hinman was sentenced to between one and five years in prison. In 1957, one of Chotiner's divorce clients had been killed along with her daughter by the client's estranged husband in the attorney's Beverly Hills office.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{enactment}} of the twenty-sixth amendment to the United States Constitution, most states passed legislation lowering the age of majority from twenty-one to eighteen. A crucial question arising from these statutes is whether they affect or should affect child support settlements which provide for support to the child until he or she reaches the age of majority. This note discusses the key question whether children have a continuing right to support until age twenty-one under settlements resulting from <b>divorce</b> <b>decrees</b> and agreements made prior to {{the enactment}} of the new age of majority laws. The note analyzes the conflicts among state court decisions as to: (1) child support mandated by judicial decrees; (2) child support agreements pursuant to separation agreements or property settlements; and (3) child support agreements incorporated into <b>divorce</b> <b>decrees.</b> The note concludes that there is little agreement as to the effect of the age of majority statutes on existing support settlements but suggests that courts should not forget that even person between the age of eighteen and twenty-one are encumbered with numerous economic disabilities...|$|R

[...] In response, Trump withheld $1.5 million in alimony he owed Maples, claiming she was in violation of the confidentiality agreement in the couple's <b>divorce</b> <b>decree.</b> [...] After a Manhattan judge refused to hear the matter, a brief conference was held, wherein the judge's law secretary advised Trump to pay the alimony and advised Maples that further incidents would be cause for the judge to reconsider hearing the matter.

2500|$|On 24 December 1889, Captain O'Shea {{filed for}} divorce, citing Parnell as co-respondent, {{although}} the case {{did not come}} for trial until 15 November 1890.

[...] Meanwhile, Parnell assured the Irish Party {{that there was no}} need to fear the verdict; he would be exonerated. During January 1890, resolutions of confidence in his leadership were passed throughout the country. [...] Parnell did not contest the divorce action at a hearing on 15 November, to ensure that it would be granted and he could marry Mrs O'Shea; so Captain O'Shea's allegations went unchallenged. A <b>divorce</b> <b>decree</b> was granted on 17 November 1890, but Parnell's two surviving children were placed in O'Shea's custody.|$|E

2500|$|West {{was married}} on April 11, 1911, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Frank Szatkus, whose stage name was Frank Wallace, a fellow vaudevillian whom she first met in 1909. She was 17; he was 21. West kept the {{marriage}} a secret, but in 1935, after West had made several hit movies, a filing clerk discovered West's marriage certificate and alerted the press. An affidavit {{in which she}} had declared herself married, which she made during the Sex trial in 1927, was also uncovered. At first, West denied ever marrying Wallace, but she finally admitted in July 1937, in reply to a legal interrogatory, that they had been married. Although legally wed, the couple never lived together as husband and wife. She insisted they have separate bedrooms, and she soon sent him away in a show of his own to get rid of him.
