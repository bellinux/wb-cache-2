40|$|Abstract. In {{a three-year}} study, mite populations were {{monitored}} in two vineyards, each having two grape varieties with different leaf hair density. In both vineyards native phytoseiids were present: Amblyseius andersoni in one vineyard, and Phytoseius finitimus in the other. The economically important predators Kampimodromus aberrans and Typhlodromus pyri were released in both vineyards {{in order to}} study their efficacy in controlling tetranychids and <b>eriophyids</b> and their persistence during periods of prey scarcity. In both vineyards, relative abundances of the mite species, especially phytoseiids, were found to differ on different varieties in the same vineyard. In the first experiment, A. andersoni reached higher densities and was more persistent on the variety with slightly pubescent leaf under-surface (Merlot). Typhlodromus pyri and K. aberrans releases were successful and the mites became more abundant on the variety with pubescent leaf under-surface (Verduzzo). In the second experiment, P. finitimus was more abundant on a variety with pubescent leaf under-surface (Prosecco) than with glabrous leaf under-surface (Riesling). The most interesting {{results of the present}} study concerned the interactions between native and released predators. In the first vineyard, different results were obtained when releasing T. pyri on the two varieties. On the variety with pubescent leaves, A. andersoni was rapidly displaced by T. pyri, whereas the former species persisted on the other variety throughout the three-year study, apparentl...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} importance {{which the}} European red mite (Paratetranychus pilosus (Can. et Fanz.)) (= Metatetranychus ulmi (Koch)) has assumed {{in recent years}} has led to an intensive study of its biology and natural history. In the course of these investigations many workers, and in particular those in Nova Scotia (vide Lord, 1949), have become convinced that this pest can be controlled, on apple trees at least, by natural means and that some of the most active agents in its eradication are the representatives of that group of predaceous mites which Vitzthum (1941) placed in the subfamily Phytoseiinae Ber'lese, 1916 1). As the late Dr. A. C. Oudemans of Arnhem included many if not most of these species in the genus Typhlodromus as he conceived it, this paper is in essence a revision of that genus. Presumably because of their small size and limited distribution, which is largely contingent upon readily available populations of their hosts, little {{attention has been paid to}} these predators from either the ecological or taxonomic point of view. A cursory survey of the literature pertaining to the predaceous relationship which exists between the Phytoseiinae herein to be discussed and the tetranychid mites may serve as an appraisal of this economically significant group of mites. Koch (1839) in describing what now appears to be a typhlodromid, viz., Gamasus vepallidus, made no reference to its possible predaceous habits. Scheuten (1857) thought that the <b>eriophyids</b> which he found associated in numbers with his Typhlodromus pyri were its offspring. Berlese (1882 - 1898), however, had a better understanding of these relationships and was able to state in his redescription of G. vepallidus as Seius (Seiulus) vepallidus (K.) that it was a predator of small acari as well as being a mycophage.

It {{is a member of}} the genus Emaravirus and family Bunyaviridae and is transmitted mainly by the <b>eriophyid</b> mite Aceria ficus. FMV can cause a range of symptoms varying in severity, including leaf chlorosis, deformity, and mosaic or discoloration patterns, as well as premature fruit drop.|$|E

5000|$|Vasates quadripedes, {{the maple}} bladder-gall mite, is an <b>eriophyid</b> mite in the genus Vasates, which causes galls on {{the leaves of}} silver maple (Acer saccharinum), red maple (A. rubrum), and sugar maple (A. saccharum). The gall is rounded, {{sometimes}} elongate, and has a short, thin neck. Typically, galls are 2-3 mm in diameter, and may be numerous on the upper surfaces of leaves. They have {{an opening in the}} lower surface. At first they are yellowish-green or bright red, later they become dark red and black.|$|E
50|$|His first work on cecidology dated back to 1897 (when he was 21 yrs old) and he {{reported}} 124 galls of which 21 {{were caused by}} <b>eriophyid</b> mites. Trotter travelled around Italy between 1899 and 1909 and described 742 galls in 20 papers. At the age of 28 he founded a journal called Marcella in honour of Marcello Malpighi which dealt with cecidology.He later became professor of plant pathology at the University of Naples and wrote more than 400 publications with nearly 110 on plant galls. He described several new species of Cynipidae and Cecidomyiidae some with Jean-Jacques Kieffer.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to causing phyllody itself, insects and other ectoparasites {{also serve as}} disease vectors that can spread phyllody to other nearby plants. The most common of these insect vectors are leafhoppers, an example of which is Hishimonus phycitis, which transmits the phytoplasma-caused little leaf phyllody in eggplants. The broken-backed bug (Taylorilygus apicalis) is another insect vector of a phytoplasma-caused phyllody in species of Parthenium. Other ectoparasite vectors include <b>eriophyid</b> mites, like the rose leaf curl mite (Phyllocoptes fructiplilus) which {{is known to be}} the primary vector of the rose rosette disease; and the chrysanthemum rust mite (Paraphytoptus chrysanthemi) which transmits phytoplasma-caused phyllody in species of chrysanthemums.|$|E

His descriptive work of this economically important group, spanned thirty years and describing 630 new taxa in 56 publications led to Keifer becoming a world expert on the group. In his 39 years at the Department of Agriculture his expertise covered all orders of insects, recording the biology's, geographical distributions and first occurrences. He published his results in the Bulletin of The California Department of Agriculture and also published papers on more than 150 species of moths. His collection of mites was donated to the National Museum of Natural History Entomological Collection at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC.|$|E
5000|$|A. fuchsiae is host {{specific}} {{and the only}} <b>eriophyid</b> mite known to attack Fuchsia. It feeds on the shoot tips, where it sucks sap. It produces chemicals that interfere with the plant's normal growth, which instead becomes a distorted mass of reddish-pink or yellowish green tissue. There are several generations between late spring and autumn; the life cycle takes about 21 days at 18°C. There are four life stages: egg, larva, nymph and adult. Eggs take between 4 and 7 days to hatch at 18°C, and females lay up to 50 eggs at one time. The mite's cold tolerance is not known; it may remain active over winter if temperatures are high enough, though in cooler areas overwintering occurs beneath bud scales. The Northwest Fuchsia Society states that mites in the Pacific Northwest of the USA may {{have been killed by}} [...] occurring over 3 to 4 nights, though outdoor mite populations in southern England appear to have survived winters with prolonged periods below [...] Colonization of new Fuchsia plants occurs either by the mites being blown by wind or via hitching rides on insects and other animals travelling between plants.|$|E
5000|$|Insects and mites {{that feed}} on the seeds and cones of P. pinaster can be {{effective}} biological control options. An insect or mite that acts as an ideal biological control should have a high reproductive rate and be host-specific, meaning that it preys specifically on P. pinaster. The life cycle of the predator should also match that of its specific host. Two key characteristics the predator should also exhibit are self-limitation {{and the ability to}} survive {{in the presence of a}} declining prey population. [...] Seed feeding insects are an effective control because they have high reproductive rates and target the seeds without diminishing the positive effect of the plant on the environment. Controlling the spread of P. pinaster seeds in the region is the key to limiting the growth and spread of this species because P. pinaster has the ability to produce a large number of seeds that are capable of dispersing very efficiently. [...] One possible option is Trisetacus, an <b>eriophyid</b> mite. The main advantage to using this mite to control the population of P. Pinaster is its specificity to P. pinaster; it can effectively control the population of P. pinaster by destroying the growing conelets in P. pinaster while limiting its impact to only this species. Another possible option is Pissodes validirostris, a cone-feeding weevil that lays eggs in developing cones. When the larvae hatch, they {{feed on the}} growing seed tissue, preventing P. pinaster seeds from forming and dispersing. Although the adults feed on the trees as well, they do not do any damage to the seeds and only feed on the shoots of the tree, so they do not appear to negatively impact the growth of the trees. Different forms of P. validirostris have diverged to become host-specific to different pine trees. The type of P. validirostris that originated from Portugal appears to have specialized to P. pinaster; therefore, this insect may be used in the future to control the spread of P. pinaster in South Africa. The uncertainties regarding the host-specificity of different types of P. validirostris, however, require more research to be completed before the introduction of the weevils into South Africa. An introduction of a species that is not host-specific to P. pinaster can lead to detrimental effects on both the environment and commercial industries that are dependent on certain tree species. Two other biological control possibilities include the pyralid moth species Dioryctria mendasella and D. mitatella, but these species attack the vegetative tissue instead of just the seeds of P. pinaster, harming the plant itself. [...] As of now, the <b>eriophyid</b> mite and cone-feeding weevil seem to hold the most potential to controlling the spread of P. pinaster in the regions it has invaded because they destroy the reproductive structures of the target invasive species.|$|E
50|$|These can {{be traced}} back to the {{mechanisms}} of action, which lead to a wide field of effects, including direct lethality, excitant-repellant behavioral effects, and chemosterilization for the target species. In addition, it generally causes low damage to nontarget species, which is one of the advantages of amitraz. Furthermore, amitraz is especially effective against insects such as spider mites and ticks in their juvenile and resistant forms.For agricultural purposes amitraz is primarily used to control the pear psylla (Cacopsylla pyricola) on Oregon pear crops and whiteflies and mites on cotton or pear crops.It's also applied to pome fruit, citrus fruit, cotton, stone fruit, bush fruit, strawberries, hops, cucurbits, aubergines, capsicums, tomatoes and ornamental plants to control all stages of tetranychid and <b>eriophyid</b> mites, pear suckers, scale insects, mealybugs, whiteflies, aphids and eggs and first instar larvae of lepidoptera.To apply amitraz, various techniques can be used such as an airblast and concentrate spray to pears or by ground boom and aircraft to cotton.Territorial differences in amitraz use depend on the species of mites that infest the crops/trees/etc., the local practice, and the number and size of the pear trees. An infestation e.g. by Tetranychus spp requires higher rates of amitraz. Taking those factors into consideration the application volumes of amitraz have been standardized in terms of maximum spray concentration and in the rate of amitraz per hectare.|$|E

40|$|<b>Eriophyid</b> mites {{have been}} {{considered}} {{to have a high}} potential for use as classical biological control agents of weeds. We reviewed known examples of the use of <b>eriophyid</b> mites to control weedy plants to learn how effective they have been. In the past 13 years, since Rosenthal's 1996 review, 13 species have undergone some degree of pre-release evaluation (Aceria genistae, A. lantanae, Aceria sp. [boneseed leaf buckle mite (BLBM) ], A. salsolae, A. sobhiani, A. solstitialis, A. tamaricis, A. thalgi, A. thessalonicae, Cecidophyes rouhollahi, Floracarus perrepae, Leipothrix dipsacivagus and L. knautiae), but only four (A. genistae, Aceria sp. [BLBM], C. rouhollahi and F. perrepae) have been authorized for introduction. Prior to this, three species (Aceria chondrillae, A. malherbae and Aculus hyperici) were introduced and have become established. Although these three species impact the fitness of their host plant, {{it is not clear how}} much they have contributed to reduction of the population of the target weed. In some cases, natural enemies, resistant plant genotypes, and adverse abiotic conditions have reduced the ability of <b>eriophyid</b> mites to control target weed populations. Some <b>eriophyid</b> mites that are highly coevolved with their host plant may be poor prospects for biological control because of host plant resistance or tolerance of the plant to the mite. Susceptibility of eriophyids to predators and pathogens may also prevent them from achieving population densities necessary to reduce host plant populations. Short generation time, high intrinsic rate of increase and high mobility by aerial dispersal imply that eriophyids should have rapid rates of evolution. This raises concerns that eriophyids may be more likely to lose efficacy over time due to coevolution with the target weed or that they may be more likely to adapt to nontarget host plants compared to insects, which have a longer generation time and slower population growth rate. Critical areas for future research include life history, foraging and dispersal behavior, mechanisms controlling host plant specificity, and evolutionary stability of <b>eriophyid</b> mites. This knowledge is critical for designing and interpreting laboratory and field experiments to measure host plant specificity and potential impact on target and nontarget plants, which must be known before they can be approved for release. One of the more successful examples of an <b>eriophyid</b> mite controlling an invasive alien weed is Phyllocoptes fructiphilus, whose impact is primarily due to transmission of a virus pathogenic to the target, Rosa multiflora. Neither the mite nor the virus originated from the target weed, which suggests that using "novel enemies" may sometimes be an effective strategy for using <b>eriophyid</b> mites...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. (Zoology) This study centres {{around the}} {{findings}} on mites (Acari: Eriophyidae) (also {{referred to as}} "eriophyids") as potential biological control agents of weeds in South Africa. The use of mites in the biological control of weeds is briefly reviewed. Four species of the family Eriophyidae have been used against weeds in other countries. Seventeen <b>eriophyid</b> species, causing symptoms possibly of significance to biological weed control of 12 plant species regarded as weeds in South Africa, are discussed. Methods to rear and study eriophyids in the laboratory {{have not yet been}} fully developed and studying these practically invisible arthropods, very closely associated with their host plants, frequently presents difficulties. Reported methods, and those used for the present study, are reviewed and discussed. The <b>eriophyid,</b> Aceria lantanae (Cook), causing flower and leaf galls on Lantana camara L. could not be successfully established in a quarantine laboratory on potted plants propagated from cuttings of L. camara forms from South Africa. The results obtained during this attempt were inconclusive. The failure of establishment on local L. camara forms could be attributed to a variety of factors, of which rearing methods and host incompatibility are the most likely. Convolvulus arvensis is a troublesome agricultural weed and occurs in especially the Orange Free State and the eastern and southern parts of the Cape Province. Biological control may possibly contribute to curbing this weed in South Africa. The <b>eriophyid,</b> Aceria malherbae Nuzzaci, causing deformation and galling on C. arvensis is {{regarded as one of the}} most promising candidates for the biological control of this weed. It was imported and successfully established on potted plants in a quarantine laboratory on biotypes of the weed occurring in South Africa. The biology and host specificity of A malherbae are accounted for, by using reported information and data obtained during this study. The biology of A. malherbae broadly conforms to the biology of other <b>eriophyid</b> species. This species has a narrow host range, being restricted to species very closely related to C. arvensis. The symptoms caused by this <b>eriophyid</b> on C. arvensis are described, and seem especially harmful to the reproductive potential of the plant.
