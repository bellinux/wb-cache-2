5|$|Tokyo {{has been}} the site of many {{skyscraper}} construction projects in recent years. Since 2010, 13buildings rising higher than 185metres (607ft) have been completed. As of February 2017, eight such buildings are under construction in the prefecture. Several other construction projects planned to exceed the height of 185metres are proposed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>near</b> future.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{pressure}} tendency, {{the condition of}} the sky {{is one of the more}} important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>near</b> future. A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{disruptions}} caused by the Napoleonic Wars, the papal bull nominating Egan did not reach the United States until 1810. When it arrived, Egan traveled to St. Peter's Pro-cathedral in Baltimore, where he was ordained bishop by Carroll, assisted by Benedict Joseph Flaget and Jean-Louis de Cheverus, who had been appointed to bishoprics but {{had not yet been}} consecrated. Egan chose St. Mary's to serve as his pro-cathedral in Philadelphia. Even before Egan's installation, Philadelphia Catholics began to raise funds to expand the church in accordance with its new prominence in the diocese. After their ordinations, the new bishops planned a council of the American church leadership <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>near</b> future; in fact, they did not meet until 1829, long after Egan's death.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} Polish casualties—or {{according}} to one historian, possibly because of them—the battle has been largely neglected in Polish historiography. During {{the period of the}} People's Republic of Poland it was portrayed merely as a difficult but victorious battle. However, since the fall of communism modern Polish historians have been much more critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming his drive on Dresden <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>near</b> destruction of the Polish force. Świerczewski's lack of competence, according to some sources, included commanding the battle while drunk. He was briefly relieved of command by Marshal Konev, but due to the backing of the Soviet high command (most likely the NKVD) he not only retained his position but all controversies were hushed up, and after the war was hailed as a hero. The actions of other Polish officers have also been questioned, such as the 9th Infantry Division commander's decision to advance without sufficient reconnaissance and escort.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the unrest in Sicily, a wave of rioting spread through Italy in August 1893, triggered by {{the killing of a}} number of migrant workers in the salt pans of Aigues Mortes in southern France escalated into a more generalized working-class revolt supported by anarchists and violent riots in Rome and Naples. Italy seemed to be slipping to a revolution. By the time Crispi returned to power in December 1893, Italy appeared to many to be on the brink of collapse. Crispi promised important measures of land reform <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>near</b> future. He was not blind to the misery and the need for social reform. Before 1891 he had been the patron of the Sicilian working-class and many of their associations had been named after him. Colajanni, the chief architect of Giolitti’s fall by exposing the Banca Romana scandal, was first offered the Ministry of Agriculture, which he refused, then sent to Sicily on a mission of appeasement.|$|E
5|$|Most {{states had}} placed {{restrictions}} on fisher trapping by the 1930s, coincidental {{with the end}} of the logging boom. A combination of forest regrowth in abandoned farmlands and improved forest management practices increased available habitat and allowed remnant populations to recover. Populations have since recovered sufficiently that the species is no longer endangered. Increasing forest cover in eastern North America means that fisher populations will remain sufficiently robust <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>near</b> future. Between 1955 and 1985, some states had allowed limited trapping to resume. In areas where fishers were eliminated, porcupine populations subsequently increased. Areas with a high density of porcupines were found to have extensive damage to timber crops. In these cases, fishers were reintroduced by releasing adults relocated from other places into the forest. Once the fisher populations became reestablished, porcupine numbers returned to natural levels. In Washington State, fisher sightings were reported into the 1980s, but an extensive survey in the 1990s did not locate any.|$|E

5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>near</b> surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} arm of {{the lake}} has a much higher salinity, {{to the point that}} the native brine shrimp cannot survive in its waters. In the southern portion, where the vast majority of the fresh water inlets are found, the salt level can dip below what is necessary for the brine shrimp to survive, while water in the northern bay is too salty. The salinity of northern {{arm of the}} lake will likely drop as lower salinity from the southern arm of the lake flows into the northern arm. The brine shrimp harvesting industry could benefit from the causeway allowing a freer flow of water. There were concerns from the brine shrimp harvesting industry that the lake conditions in the southern arm of the lake were becoming too saline for the brine shrimp due to several years of lower precipitation in the lake's watershed. The precipitation in the watershed has been above normal for the current water year that begins its tracking October 1, 2016. This additional precipitation has allowed the levels of both arms of the lake to rise, and at least <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>near</b> future the conditions for a healthy brine shrimp population seem good.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{negotiating}} the actual arrangements {{turned out to}} be difficult and lasted from 1563 to 1569, with the Lithuanian magnates, worried about losing their dominant position, being at times uncooperative. It took Sigismunt II's unilateral declaration of the incorporation into the Polish Crown of substantial disputed border regions, including most of Lithuanian Ukraine, to make the Lithuanian magnates rejoin the process, and participate in the swearing of the act of the Union of Lublin on July 1, 1569. Lithuania <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>near</b> future was becoming more secure on the eastern front. It's increasingly Polonized nobility made in the coming centuries great contributions to the Commonwealth's culture, but at the cost of Lithuanian national development.|$|E
