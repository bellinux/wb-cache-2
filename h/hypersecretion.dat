25|$|Cushing’s {{syndrome}} {{arises from}} the repeated <b>hypersecretion</b> of glucocorticoids. It {{can be caused by}} either an adrenal tumor or by <b>hypersecretion</b> of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland. It is predominantly due to an excess of the glucocorticoid cortisol. Secretion is typically regulated by the hypothalamus which secretes corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to the pituitary gland, stimulating the pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then travels to the adrenal glands and induces the release of cortisol into the bloodstream. In Cushing’s syndrome, this process occurs in excess. Some symptoms of an individual with Cushing’s syndrome include low tissue protein levels, due to muscle and bone atrophy, and high blood glucose levels. Sodium levels also see an increase which results in fluid retention in tissues and elevated blood pressure. In addition to <b>hypersecretion</b> of cortisol, excess androgens are secreted. In females, increased secretion of androgens, such as testosterone, results in masculinization which may present as facial hair growth and a deepened voice.|$|E
25|$|Acne-form {{dermatitis}} {{and other}} forms of skin disease may also be seen, as well as mucous <b>hypersecretion</b> in the lungs. Asthma and rhinitis may worsen. Rarely, tongue disorder, aphten, bad breath, and obstipation occur.|$|E
25|$|These {{effects on}} HPA hormone levels may be {{beneficial}} for some individuals but may have undesirable effects in those with medical conditions featuring ACTH or cortisol <b>hypersecretion</b> including PCOS, type II diabetes and major depressive disorder.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that much like cystic fibrosis, by living in a more urban environment serious health hazards become more apparent. Studies have shown that in urban areas patients suffer mucus <b>hypersecretion,</b> lower levels of lung function, and more self-diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and emphysema.|$|E
25|$|Attention, memory, {{and spatial}} ability are key {{cognitive}} functions affected by testosterone in humans. Preliminary {{evidence suggests that}} low testosterone levels may be {{a risk factor for}} cognitive decline and possibly for dementia of the Alzheimer's type, a key argument in life extension medicine for the use of testosterone in anti-aging therapies. Much of the literature, however, suggests a curvilinear or even quadratic relationship between spatial performance and circulating testosterone, where both hypo- and <b>hypersecretion</b> (deficient- and excessive-secretion) of circulating androgens have negative effects on cognition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypersecretion</b> is {{more common}} than hyposecretion. Hyperprolactinemia is the most {{frequent}} abnormality of the anterior pituitary tumors, termed prolactinomas. Prolactinomas may disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis as prolactin tends to suppress the secretion of GnRH from the hypothalamus and in turn decreases the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary, therefore disrupting the ovulatory cycle. Such hormonal changes may manifest as amenorrhea and infertility in females as well as impotence in males. Inappropriate lactation (galactorrhoea) is another important clinical sign of prolactinomas.|$|E
25|$|Treatment for Cushing’s {{syndrome}} aims {{to reduce}} {{the high levels of}} cortisol circulating through the human body. The course of action ultimately depends on the cause of the <b>hypersecretion.</b> Cushing’s can be induced by repeated synthetic steroid use to treat inflammatory diseases, or it can also be caused by a tumor in the pituitary gland or adrenal gland. In either case, treatment may rely on removal of the tumor or of the adrenal glands. Without the adrenal glands, the human body is unable to supply the hormones it produces and therefore requires hormone replacement therapy.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{and probably}} {{most widely accepted}} scientific theory of antidepressant action is the monoamine hypothesis (which {{can be traced back}} to the 1950s), which states that depression is due to an imbalance (most often a deficiency) of the monoamine neurotransmitters (namely serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine). It was originally proposed based on the observation that certain hydrazine anti-tuberculosis agents produce antidepressant effects, which was later linked to their inhibitory effects on monoamine oxidase, the enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of the monoamine neurotransmitters. All currently marketed antidepressants have the monoamine hypothesis as their theoretical basis, with the possible exception of agomelatine which acts on a dual melatonergic-serotonergic pathway. Despite the success of the monoamine hypothesis it has a number of limitations: for one, all monoaminergic antidepressants have a delayed onset of action of at least a week; and secondly, there are a sizeable portion (>40%) of depressed patients that do not adequately respond to monoaminergic antidepressants. A number of alternative hypotheses have been proposed, including the glutamate, neurogenic, epigenetic, cortisol <b>hypersecretion</b> and inflammatory hypotheses.|$|E
25|$|The IL-17F gene was {{discovered}} in 2001, and is located on chromosome 6p12. Notably, among this family, IL-17F has been well characterized both in vitro and in vivo, and {{has been shown to}} have a pro-inflammatory role in asthma. IL-17F is clearly expressed in the airway of asthmatics and its expression level is correlated with disease severity. Moreover, a coding region variant (H161R) of the IL-17F gene is inversely associated with asthma and encodes an antagonist for the wild-type IL-17F. IL-17F is able to induce several cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules in bronchial epithelial cells, vein endothelial cells, fibroblasts and eosinophils. IL-17F utilizes IL-17RA and IL-17RC as its receptors, and activates the MAP kinase related pathway. IL-17F is derived from several cell types such as Th17 cells, mast cells and basophils, and shows a wide tissue expression pattern including lung. Overexpression of IL-17F gene in the airway of mice is associated with airway neutrophilia, the induction of many cytokines, an increase in airway hyperreactivity, and mucus <b>hypersecretion.</b> Hence, IL-17F may have a crucial role in allergic airway inflammation, and have important therapeutic implications in asthma.|$|E
