40|$|Nearly all {{facilities}} that store hazardous (radioactive or non-radioactive) materials {{must comply with}} prevailing federal, state, and local laws. These laws usually have components that require periodic physical inspections to insure that all materials remain safely and securely stored. The inspections are generally labor intensive, slow, put personnel at risk, and only find anomalies after they have occurred. The system described in this paper was developed for monitoring stored nuclear materials resulting from weapons dismantlement, but its applications extend to any storage facility that meets the above criteria. The traditional special nuclear material (SNM) accountability programs, that are currently used within most of the Department of Energy (DOE) complex, require the physical entry of highly trained personnel into SNM storage vaults. This imposes {{the need for additional}} security measures, which typically mandate that extra security personnel be present while SNM inventories are performed. These requirements increase labor costs and put additional personnel at risk to radiation exposure. In some cases, individuals have received radiation exposure equivalent to the annual maximum during just one <b>inventory</b> <b>verification.</b> With increasing overhead costs, the current system is rapidly becoming too expensive to operate, the need for an automated method of <b>inventory</b> <b>verification</b> is evident.

40|$|According to the Generation IV International Forum Technology Roadmap, Sodium Fast Reactors (SFR) {{could be}} a {{promising}} technology for minor actinides management. In view of a much higher radiological barrier, the addition of minor actinides to fresh fuel assemblies would change {{the way in which}} fresh fuel can be stored and handled, impacting not only on routine operations but also on the activities carried out during international safeguards inspections. While it is generally considered that the presence of minor actinides in fresh fuel assemblies would decrease the attractiveness of this potential target for a proliferator willing to divert nuclear material - thus increasing the proliferation resistance of the entire facility -, it might have perverse repercussions on the overall safeguardability of the target. In particular, the presence of minor actinides might complicate the measurement activities performed by safeguards inspectors during physical <b>inventory</b> <b>verifications</b> (PIV). The level of impact depends on the actual composition of the available fuel and might affect the current safeguards approach. This paper will present some considerations on a) the fuel assemblies’ material composition and its attractiveness for a potential weaponisation phase, b) the potential increase of the PR of a system employing MA-bearing fresh fuel, and c) the safeguardability of MA-bearing fuel assemblies.

40|$|The Next Generation Safeguards Initiative {{includes}} a process monitoring (PM) project with near-term and long-term objectives. One role for PM {{is to support}} nuclear materials accounting (NMA), particularly in cases where NMA cannot meet loss detection goals, such as at large throughput facilities. At large facilities, interim <b>inventory</b> <b>verifications</b> are frequent, perhaps every 10 days, and there is limited ability to reduce in-process inventory, which is often measured with relatively high uncertainty. Therefore, inprocess inventory can have a relatively large impact on NMA performance {{as measured by the}} standard error of the material balance. In the context of safeguarding a large aqueous reprocessing facility to recover plutonium from spent nuclear fuel, this paper describes four roles for solution monitoring (SM) as a type of PM in support of NMA. First, SM helps understand facility status at the time of interim inventory. Second, SM can provide a by-difference estimate and associated uncertainty of material holdup in process equipment that is not directly measureable but is bracketed by measurement points. Third, SM can assess the adequacy of measurement error models such as those used to quantify the uncertainty in solution volume measurements. Fourth, SM together with models of unit operations can provide an inferred or estimated book value for waste or other low-Pu-mass streams that allows tighter control limits than are possible with NMA alone...|$|R
40|$|COMPUCEA (Combined Procedure for Uranium Concentration and Enrichment Assay) is used {{to support}} {{physical}} <b>inventory</b> <b>verifications</b> (PIV) at uranium fuel production facilities by high-accuracy in-field uranium concentration and enrichment measurements. The COMPUCEA procedure {{was developed by the}} Institute for Transuranium Elements (ITU) and its present version is in routine use for EURATOM inspections in Europe since 2007. In 2011 it has been authorized by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and it is used by the IAEA for PIV campaigns in Kazakhstan. In order to improve the robustness of the COMPUCEA measurement procedure, new software was developed by the IAEA. The new software guides the user through the sample preparation process and provides a user-friendly interface for calibration, sample evaluation and quality control. Its development started in 2011 and since then it was constantly tested and refined to reach its current stage. In addition, some improvements of the analytical procedure were implemented in the new software. It was tested and validated by ITU to authorize its use for measurement campaigns at fuel fabrication plants and for analyses in ITU. The results calculated by the new software agree very well with results from the previous software and with results from Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry. As the new software makes it much easier to provide high-accuracy analytical results with COMPUCEA, it is planned to be used in field from 2015 onwards. JRC.

A Swedish research program called GENIUS aims at developing the Gen IV technology, with emphasis on lead-cooled fast reactors. The present work is part of the GENIUS project, and deals with safeguards aspects for an envisioned future 100 MW Gen IV demonstration facility including storage and reprocessing plant. Also, the safeguards licensing aspects for the facilities have been investigated and results thereof are presented. As a basis for the study, the changed usage and handling of nuclear fuel, as compared to that of today, have been examined in order to determine how today's safeguards measures can be modified and extended {{to meet the needs of}} the demonstration facility. Safeguards approaches have been considered for within and between each unit at the demonstration facility, with the main focus on system aspects rather than proposing safeguards instrumentation on a detailed level. The proposed safeguards approach include the implementation of well-tried measures that are used at currently existing nuclear facilities as well as suggestions for new procedures. The former include, among others, regular <b>inventory</b> <b>verifications,</b> containment and surveillance measures as well as non-destructive and destructive measurements of nuclear materials. The traditional approaches may be improved and supplemented by modern techniques and approaches such as nuclear forensics, safeguards-by-design and improved on-line monitoring of streams of nuclear material.

Landsat digital classifications of large areas (3 ̆e 1 million hectares) were used to support collection of ground data on plant productivity and soils. This technique was effective where the inventory team {{had little or no}} previous knowledge of the area, and a very short summer field season to collect field data. Problems were encountered where resource categories differed from Landsat spectral classes across these large areas, due to regional differences in ecological condition. A means was required to break the survey area into smaller units so that resource categories could be locally described. Winter Landsat imagery was photo interpreted to stratify the survey areas into physiographic units. Images were selected from mid-winter, when the landscape is snow covered, and low sun angles provide enhancement of subtle topographic patterns.

Results of holdup measurements using a commercial, portable gamma-cameras are presented. The authors are also developing fast neutron imaging techniques for NDA, search, and holdup.
