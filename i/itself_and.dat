5|$|Some medieval rabbis {{claimed that}} today's Western Wall is a {{surviving}} {{wall of the}} Temple <b>itself</b> <b>and</b> cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest they enter the Temple precincts {{in a state of}} impurity. Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness. Most secular scholars believe however that these traditions originally pertained to a western wall of the Temple <b>itself,</b> <b>and</b> since the 1500s, were gradually applied to the surviving retaining Western Wall of the Mount.|$|E

5|$|A {{short film}} based upon Half-Life {{entitled}} Half-Life: Uplink, {{was developed by}} Cruise Control, a British marketing agency, and was released on March 15, 1999. However, Sierra withdrew it from circulation, after <b>itself</b> <b>and</b> Valve had failed to resolve licensing issues with Cruise Control over the film. The critical reception of the film was very poor. The plot of the film was that a journalist infiltrates the Black Mesa Research Facility, trying to discover what has happened there.|$|E

5|$|After Ligny, the Prussian army, {{although}} defeated, {{was able}} to realign its supply train, reorganise <b>itself,</b> <b>and</b> intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours. Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under Bülow, commander of IV Corps, attacked Lobau at 16:30, while Zieten's I Corps and parts of Pirch I's II Corps engaged at about 18:00.|$|E
5|$|All in all, a GRB {{within a}} few parsecs, with its energy {{directed}} towards Earth, will mostly damage life by raising the UV levels during the burst <b>itself</b> <b>and</b> {{for a few years}} thereafter.

It has proved difficult to assess a reliable evaluation of the consequences of this on the terrestrial ecosystem, because of the uncertainty in biological field and laboratory data.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the exact}} {{details of the}} {{assassination}} remain disputed, {{the involvement of the}} Portuguese government, particularly Aginter Press or PIDE, is generally accepted by most historians and biographers and is supported by the Portuguese stay behind Gladio-esque army, known as Aginter Press, that suggested in 1990 that they were responsible for the assassination. Initially, due to the uncertainty regarding who was responsible, Mondlane's death created great suspicion within the ranks of the FRELIMO <b>itself</b> <b>and</b> a short power struggle which resulted in a dramatic swing to the political left.|$|E
