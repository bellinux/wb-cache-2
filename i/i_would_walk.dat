500|$|She enjoyed {{drinking}} Scotch and sherry; as {{friend and}} neighbor Helen Muir remembered her, [...] "She {{would come up}} and have a sherry, and then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> her home, and then she'd walk me back, {{and we would have}} another sherry. What fun she was." [...] Novelist Hervey Allen called Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Muir, [...] "the Stewart Avenue Gang". The two were fond of having sherry together and gossiping, but those moments were followed by serious talk of the future of libraries, and {{the role of women in}} South Florida. They were confidants, and often shared their work with one another. Douglas never learned to drive and never owned a car. Her house also had no air conditioning, electric stove, or dishwasher.|$|E
500|$|Several {{actors were}} {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Robert Modell, even Lance Henriksen, who went on to play the lead role in Millennium. Initially, Gilligan considered Harvey Fierstein for the role of Modell, but Robert Wisden read the script and [...] "blew us away". Rob Bowman was pleased with Wisden's performance and said, [...] "I thought Robert Wisden was great as Pusher. He is a very energized kind of confident actor with lots of ideas of his own. It took me about {{a day and a half}} to get him into it, and then I never had to speak to him again, because he had that look in his eyes. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> up to talk to him about the scene and I could see that he was already there.|$|E
500|$|Richard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary, an {{electrical}} lineman in Indiana who encounters and forms {{an obsession with}} unidentified flying objects. Steve McQueen was Spielberg's first choice. Although McQueen {{was impressed with the}} script, he felt he was not right for the role as he was unable to cry on cue. Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino and Gene Hackman turned down the part as well. Jack Nicholson turned it down because of scheduling conflicts. Spielberg explained when filming Jaws, [...] "Dreyfuss talked me into casting him. He listened to about 155 days' worth of Close Encounters. He even contributed ideas." [...] Dreyfuss reflected, [...] "I launched myself into a campaign to get the part. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> by Steve's office and say stuff like 'Al Pacino has no sense of humor' or 'Jack Nicholson is too crazy'. I eventually convinced him to cast me." ...|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} for Deep Blue Sea {{began on}} August 3, 1998. Most {{of the film}} was shot at Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where the production team constructed sets above the large water tanks that had been built for James Cameron's 1997 film Titanic. Some of the sets were designed {{so that they could}} be submerged, while others were built on sound stages with fishtanks used as windows. At Fox Baja Studios, the cast worked with sharks that were either animatronic or computer generated. As the shark used in Jaws was 25 feet long, Harlin decided to increase their animatronic shark to 26 feet. Jackson recalled, [...] "When they first brought it into the lab we were all in awe of the size of this machine [...] It was a real monster. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> up to it slowly and touch it and they said it felt like a real shark. The gills moved and it had {{a mind of its own}} sometimes." [...] As an added homage to Jaws, the license plate pulled from the shark's teeth by Carter is the same plate found in the tiger shark carcass from Spielberg's film.|$|E
500|$|Sharma {{was raised}} in Bangalore. She was educated at the Army School there, and {{received}} a degree in arts from Mount Carmel College. She originally intended {{to pursue a career}} in modelling or journalism, and had no aspirations to be an actress. After graduation, Sharma moved to Mumbai to further her modelling career. She enrolled herself at the Elite Model Management, and was groomed by the style consultant Prasad Bidapa. In 2007, Sharma made her runway debut at the Lakme Fashion Week for designer Wendell Rodricks's Les Vamps Show and was picked to be his finale model at the Spring Summer 2007 Collection. Since then she has done campaigns for the brands Silk & Shine, Whisper, Nathella Jewelry and Fiat Palio. Sharma later said, [...] "I think I was born to emote and act. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> down the ramp and smile and they used to say, ‘give us a blank look.’ It was really difficult, not to smile". Whilst modelling, Sharma also joined an acting school and began auditioning for film roles. Her first role was of an extra in the comedy drama Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006).|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of his execution, Peace ate a hearty breakfast of bacon, and calmly awaited {{the coming of the}} public executioner, William Marwood, {{inventor}} of the [...] "long drop". He was escorted on the death-walk by the prison chaplain, who was reading aloud from The Consolations of Religion about the fires of hell. Peace burst out [...] "Sir, if I believed what you and the church of God say that you believe, even if England were covered with broken glass from coast to coast, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> over it, if need be, on hands and knees and think it worth while living, just to save one soul from an eternal hell like that!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why?" [...] he said. [...] "Surely that can't be necessary. I {{think there}} is only one thing that could have stopped my going. If it hadn't been for that, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>walked</b> bare-foot across the Province to join the ship." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "The law has now {{done its}} part, and the Queen of England, her crown and Government in Ireland, are now secure {{pursuant}} to Act of Parliament. I have done my part also. Three months ago I promised Lord Clarendon, and his government, in this country, that I would provoke {{him into his}} courts of justice, as places of this kind are called, and that I would force him publicly and notoriously to pack a Jury against me to convict me, or else that if <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> out a free man from this dock, to meet him in another field. My lord, I knew I was setting my life on that cast; but I warned him that in either event the victory would be with me, and the victory is with me. Neither the jury, nor the judges, nor any other man in this court, presumes to imagine {{that it is a}} criminal who stands in this dock. I have kept my word.|$|E
2500|$|... "He {{has that}} wall up, and it's not {{necessarily}} his fault; it's his past that has built the wall. I think maybe Babe had unrealistic expectations hoping, 'Oh, with time he'll let me in.' Well, it's their second marriage {{and they have}} a child together and it still has not changed. That wall is not budging." [...] Havins continued, [...] "Babe can only take so much. Plus, her husband tried to kill her. I honestly think, in a way, this is a hint of a delayed reaction, emotionally, to that." [...] Havins felt that JR's murder attempt on Babe seemingly came out of nowhere: It happened so fast, and the resolve was {{in the blink of an}} eye. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> away for a lot less! I think she was so wanting to get that family unit back on track that she didn't allow herself the proper time to heal. Then, on top of it, here's Josh. Everything she wants to feel with her husband she's feeling with Josh, and that's what's missing, because JR doesn't talk.|$|E
2500|$|When Leguizamo {{was four}} years old, his family immigrated to the United States, and lived in various neighborhoods in Queens, New York, {{including}} Jackson Heights. He later credited growing up {{as one of the}} first Latino children in the neighborhood as formative in his acting ability: [...] "It was tough. There were lots of fights. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>walk</b> through a park and be attacked, and I had to defend myself all the time. But this helped me to become funny so that I wouldn’t get hit." [...] Leguizamo attended the Joseph Pulitzer Middle School (I.S.145) and later the Murry Bergtraum High School. As a student at Murry Bergtraum, he wrote comedy material and tested it on his classmates. He was voted [...] "Most Talkative" [...] by his classmates. After graduating from high school, he began his theater career as an undergraduate at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, from which he eventually dropped out in favor of a career in stand-up comedy. Post-NYU, Leguizamo enrolled at LIU Post, where he took theater classes.|$|E

50|$|In a {{study done}} among non-Christian Thai people, all of them spoke {{negatively}} about the witnessing approach of EE. One respondent said, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be upset.
