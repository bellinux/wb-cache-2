Based on the experimental results of the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>mixtures,</b> a correlation was developed earlier by Zou (2010) to predict saturated flow boiling heat transfer coefficients inside horizontal smooth tubes. In this article, the proposed correlation is extended to predict evaporation of some more mixtures (such as R 50 /R 170) inside a horizontal tube by evaluating the mixture factor for that fluid. The comparisons of the present model and other classic models with the previous experimental data are made to evaluate the mean deviation for the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>mixtures.</b> It reveals that the new model is better to predict the flow boiling heat transfer for the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>mixtures...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Fischer–Tropsch iron {{catalysts}} need alkali {{promotion to}} attain high activity and stability (e.g. 0.5 wt% [...] ). Addition of Cu for reduction promotion, addition of , [...] for structural promotion {{and maybe some}} manganese can be applied for selectivity control (e.g. high olefinicity). The working catalyst is only obtained when—after reduction with hydrogen—in the initial period of synthesis several iron carbide phases and elemental carbon are formed whereas iron oxides are still present in addition to some metallic iron. With iron catalysts two directions of selectivity have been pursued. One direction has aimed at a low-molecular-weight olefinic <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>mixture</b> to be produced in an entrained phase or fluid bed process (Sasol–Synthol process). Due to the relatively high reaction temperature (approx. 340nbsp&°C), the average molecular weight of the product is so low that no liquid product phase occurs under reaction conditions. The catalyst particles moving around in the reactor are small (particle diameter 100nbsp&µm) and carbon deposition on the catalyst does not disturb reactor operation. Thus a low catalyst porosity with small pore diameters as obtained from fused magnetite (plus promoters) after reduction with hydrogen is appropriate. For maximising the overall gasoline yield, C3 and C4 alkenes have been oligomerized at Sasol. However, recovering the olefins for use as chemicals in, e.g., polymerization processes is advantageous today. The second direction of iron catalyst development has aimed at highest catalyst activity to be used at low reaction temperature {{where most of the}} hydrocarbon product is in the liquid phase under reaction conditions. Typically, such catalysts are obtained through precipitation from nitrate solutions. A high content of a carrier provides mechanical strength and wide pores for easy mass transfer of the reactants in the liquid product filling the pores. The main product fraction then is a paraffin wax, which is refined to marketable wax materials at Sasol; however, it also can be very selectively hydrocracked to a high quality diesel fuel. Thus, iron catalysts are very flexible.|$|E

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis was carried out {{during the last three}} years at the California Institute of Technology as part of Research Project 37 of the American Petroleum Institute. The general purpose of the investigation is the study of the fundamental properties of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>mixtures</b> which control their retention in underground formations. The work of earlier investigators had indicated that rather large changes in the physical properties from those observed at atmospheric pressure took place when natural <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>mixtures</b> were at equilibrium under the pressures and temperatures found in many natural reservoirs. As the physical properties such as viscosity, density, etc. have a large effect on the retention of the oil in a natural reservoir, a study of the more important of them was undertaken by the American Petroleum Institute. The work of Project 37 has been restricted to measurements of the composition, rate of solution, density, change in volume, specific heat, viscosity of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>mixtures</b> as a function of pressure and temperature. The derived thermal properties are of interest in the determination of the available energy of a natural reservoir.

50|$|The use of kinetic inhibitors and anti-agglomerants {{in actual}} field {{operations}} {{is a new}} and evolving technology. It requires extensive tests and optimisation to the actual system. While kinetic inhibitors work by slowing down the kinetics of the nucleation, anti-agglomerants do not stop the nucleation, but stop the agglomeration (sticking together) of gas hydrate crystals. These two kinds of inhibitors are also known as low dosage hydrate inhibitors, because they require much smaller concentrations than the conventional thermodynamic inhibitors. Kinetic inhibitors, which do not require water and <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>mixture</b> to be effective, are usually polymers or copolymers and anti-agglomerants (requires water and <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>mixture)</b> are polymers or zwitterionic — usually ammonium and COOH — surfactants being both attracted to hydrates and hydrocarbons.|$|E

Most {{of them have been}} used to obtain excess enthalpy data (HEm) in the critical and supercritical regions. Data are available for many mixtures formed by carbon dioxide and for a few involving other supercritical fluids such as ethane, methane, nitrous oxide, etc. Data for several N 2 O þ <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>mixtures</b> were recently measured from 308. 15 to 323. 15 K and from 7. 64 to 15. 00 MPa. Excess enthalpies for N 2 O þ <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>mixtures</b> were calculated using several cubic equations of state (EOS). Two noncubic EOS which combine the Carnahan–Starling hard-sphere term with the van der Waals and Redlich–Kwong attractive terms, were also used.
