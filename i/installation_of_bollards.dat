Recently, measures {{have been taken to}} slow down the rat run traffic through the village by the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>bollards</b> designed to inhibit through-traffic mounting the pedestrian footpath. Over recent years, the through-traffic utilising the village as a rat run had increased drastically, with the side effect being the increase in traffic incidents involving damage to the cars of the village's inhabitants. There is also an hourly bus service operated by First West of England.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to identify a simplified approach that can be used in the initial phases of the design process <b>of</b> <b>bollards.</b> Simplifications are proposed to evaluate a design without having to execute complicated numerical simulations or full-scale tests. For classical bollards, an analytical model is proposed, based on a simplification of the impact load. This analytical model is subsequently compared with a numerical simulation to assess its usefulness. Furthermore, following the increasing popularity <b>of</b> shallow mount <b>bollard</b> systems (SMB), a parametric study is performed on such a system in order to determine whether and when it can be compared to a classical <b>bollard.</b> The use <b>of</b> such models could limit the initial development time and thus the cost <b>of</b> a <b>bollard...</b>|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringVehicles intruding into {{buildings}} {{have become a}} growing problem in today's world. Several types <b>of</b> <b>bollards</b> are introduced to safeguard the buildings from vehicle borne threats. Bollard (barrier/ perimeter) security systems are structures developed to impede vehicle borne threats to buildings and highway safety devices. The real-time full-scale testing <b>of</b> anti ram <b>bollards,</b> subjected to different vehicular impacts requires much effort and is highly expensive in performing the physical testing and thereby changing the design parameters. A computational analysis though can aid in narrowing the effort and evaluate the dynamic performance <b>of</b> different <b>bollard</b> designs. In this study, finite element models <b>of</b> <b>bollard</b> systems are developed according {{to the standards of}} ASTM-WK 2534 and also validated with the experimental results. A medium-sized Ford single truck model is utilized, for the reconstruction of impact against various bollard systems at different speeds in frontal impact. The simulation results are correlated with the test results in terms of the kinematics of the truck, the nature of deformations, and the amount of vehicle penetrations. The validated results of a single vertical bollard, K 4 -rating and K 8 -rating bollard designs are shown to be in good agreement with the ones from the test results. The material, height, design <b>of</b> the <b>bollards</b> and the impact speed are then changed in a parametric study to arrive at the threshold velocity where each blade can be effective to study various bollard systems. The material <b>of</b> the <b>bollard</b> outer section, namely steel over aluminum is shown to provide better resistance during the impact. The study also showed that the addition of concrete inside the bollards could also improve effectiveness. In addition to the typical vertical bollard designs, a horizontal bomb barrier design is also modelled, simulated and analyzed. The simulated results show better resistance during an impact by absorbing more energy over a large area with very less deformation in the structure, as compared to the single vertical bollard design...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the success rate}} <b>of</b> <b>Bollard</b> miniplate anchorage for bone anchored maxillary protraction (BAMP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive patients (mean age, 12. 0 +/- 1. 2 years; range, 8. 7 - 14. 8 years) with maxillary hypoplasia without congenital or acquired deformation were included in this study. A total <b>of</b> 100 <b>Bollard</b> modified miniplates were placed by the same surgeon. Ninety-nine miniplates were inserted under general anesthesia, and one was placed under local anesthesia because of initially soft bone conditions. Loading of the miniplates with 150 g elastics was initiated at 17. 5 +/- 6. 9 days (range, 11 - 38 days) after surgery. Mean follow-up was provided at 20. 8 +/- 11. 1 months (range, 6. 5 - 46. 2 months). RESULTS: The overall success rate of miniplate anchorage in terms of stability was 97 %. During orthodontic loading, five miniplates showed signs of mobility. After interruption of loading over 2 months, two miniplates became stable again. However, {{a total of three}} miniplates needed to be removed and were successfully replaced under local anesthesia after a mean healing period of 3 months. CONCLUSION: Skeletal anchorage by means <b>of</b> <b>Bollard</b> modified miniplates is effective for BAMP. Success depends on proper presurgical patient counseling, minimal invasive surgery, good postsurgical instructions, and orthodontic follow-up...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Method {{of design}} and {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>bollard</b> pull harbour tug focuses in its stability and straight movement. Research includes {{a brief review of}} general description <b>of</b> <b>bollard</b> pull harbour tug, tug boat functions, tug boat characteristics, functions, operation modes, requirements for tug boats, stability standard and factor affecting stability, stability requirements, displacement and buoyancy, fundamental {{of design and}} a very last, fundamental of analysis. This research also discuss about the methodology to implement the design and analysis to measure the stability and movement of the tug boat. The purpose of design modelling is to identify the error of the existing design and to redesign to eliminate or reduce errors. The error consists of the hull structure and skeg design. However to redesign the hull and skeg must be done during design stage. For this report, it will discuss only the basis of the design methodology. The analysis of the stability and straight movement <b>of</b> the <b>bollard</b> pull harbour tug are using software analysis. SolidWorks and ANSYS are the proposed analysis software that will implement for this thesis. The analysis of the tug boat is study on static and dynamic analysis that discuss about finite element analysis and hydrodynamic analysis.
