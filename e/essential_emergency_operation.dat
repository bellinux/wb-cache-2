40|$|A Field Project Submitted In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For the Degree of Master of Public AdministrationThe {{problem was}} that the City of Oshkosh has not studied the impact of merging its <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> center with Winnebago County's <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> center. It is {{uncertain}} what impact merging the <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> centers would have had on the City of Oshkosh. The purpose of this field project was to identify the financial and operational impact on the City of Oshkosh if it merges its <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> center with the <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> center of Winnebago County. The descriptive research approach was utilized to guide the following research questions: (a) What are the guidelines for maintaining an <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> center within a city of comparable size to the City of Oshkosh? (b) What, if any, Wisconsin cities, similar in size to the City of Oshkosh have their own <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> center, or are combined with their county's <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> center? (c) What, if any, process of the City of Oshkosh's <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> center with Winnebago County's? The recommendations from the results would be: (a) to continue to have Winnebago County and the City of Oshkosh maintain separate <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> centers (b) merge the public information component along with associated responsibilities and infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|In New York State, all {{communities}} {{are subject to}} a variety of natural and technological disasters. Unfortunately, not all counties have a functioning <b>emergency</b> <b>operation</b> center, leaving them ill-prepared to manage a disaster and/or major incident beyond normal day-to-day emergency response systems. The purpose of this applied research paper was to address the current status of <b>emergency</b> <b>operation</b> centers within New York State. Utilizing action research methods, survey questions were sent to all 57 counties in the state. In addition, the literature review added valuable documented information regarding the subject matter. Research revealed numerous benefits with the <b>operation</b> of an <b>emergency</b> <b>operation</b> center and indicated suggested staffing methods and natural and technological threats that justify its existence. The research also identified the status of county-based <b>emergency</b> <b>operation</b> centers in New York State with approximately one third of the counties responding to the survey indicating the lack of an <b>emergency</b> <b>operations</b> center...|$|R
