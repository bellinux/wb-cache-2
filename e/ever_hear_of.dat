His father gave him [...] "a 200£ note" [...] {{to pay his}} college debts. In addition, [...] "Some goodnatured Cambridge man has made me a most magnificent anonymous present of a Microscope: did <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> such a delightful piece of luck? one {{would like to know}} who it was, just to feel obliged to him." [...] Darwin later found that the gift was from his friend John Herbert.|$|E

2500|$|Negoiță does however {{proceed to}} Negustori, {{learning}} that Acrivița was chased {{out of her}} home by the creditors and moved back in with her father. Once there, {{he claims to be}} a debtor of Ianulea's, presenting her with 100 gold coins and a deed to the Cuțitul de Argint vineyard. He manages to intrigue her by suggesting that, should she <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> a demon possessing a woman or girl, she is to walk up to the victim, call out parigboria tu kosmu, and recount her longing for Ianulea. She promises to follow his advice, and Negoiță returns to court, before deciding to head out of the city for good. He receives yet more presents from the princely family, as well as emotional thanks from Manoli Ghaiduri. As Negoiță rides out on his way to Oltenia, the devil takes control of another young lady, the daughter of Wallachia's Orthodox Metropolitan. This is Acrivița's opportunity to follow Negoiță's advice, and, as soon as she enters the room, the demon flees in panic. The story ends on Aghiuță's return to Hell, where he requests from Dardarot not to ever accept either Negoiță and Acrivița into Hell, and assign them instead to Heaven: [...] "let Saint Peter make up with them as best he can." [...] He also demands and obtains a period of rest to last three centuries, as [...] "those little affairs down on earth left me dog-tired." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second tale, {{related by}} the travel writer Will R. Bird, occurs {{at a time}} when men from the north shore of the Minas Basin used to cross the water to buy horses from farmers in the Annapolis Valley. During his summer travels in the late 1950s, Bird {{encountered}} an oldtimer on a farm near the Parrsboro golf course across the harbour from Partridge Island. [...] "You <b>ever</b> <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> our sea horse?" [...] the oldtimer asked. [...] "There ain't nothing to match it in Nova Scotia." [...] The story begins when Tom Smith crosses over to buy a mare from a man in Canning. The mare then had a black foal that [...] "was one of the finest ever seen on this shore." [...] After about seven years, the farmer from Canning showed up at Smith's farm and, obviously regretting that he had sold the mare, he offered Smith [...] "more'n twice the going price" [...] for his fast, black horse. [...] "Tom was a man who watched the dollars and he just couldn't resist," [...] the oldtimer said. The farmer from Canning took the boat back while Smith drove the horse around the Basin to deliver it. [...] "He was no more'n back home," [...] the old man said, [...] "when he happened to look toward the pasture and there was the black horse. Tom couldn't believe his eyes." [...] When he went down to the beach, he saw hoof marks showing where the animal had come ashore. Apparently, the horse had known to wait for low tide before attempting the crossing, but, it [...] "made a mighty long swim just the same." [...] The story ends with Smith returning to Canning to give the money back. [...] "He told the man he couldn't sell a horse that wanted to be with him that much, and the stranger agreed." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, Oxford!" [...] {{said the}} lady, with a sneer. [...] "What men {{choose to do}} at Oxford nobody <b>ever</b> <b>hears</b> <b>of.</b> A man may do very well at Oxford who would bring disgrace on a parish; and {{to tell you the}} truth, {{it seems to me that}} Mr. Arabin is just such a man." ...|$|R
5000|$|Travelling {{from west}} to east through inner German border was like {{entering}} a drab and disturbing dream, peopled by all the ogres of totalitarianism, a half-lit world of shabby resentments, where anything {{could be done to}} you, I used to feel, without anybody <b>ever</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>of</b> it, and your every step was dogged by watchful eyes and mechanisms.|$|R

6000|$|... "Not at all unnatural I think," [...] said I, looking tenderly and lovingly {{into her}} face. Where does one find girls so pretty, so easy, so sweet, so talkative as the Irish girls? And then {{with all their}} talking and all their ease who <b>ever</b> <b>hears</b> <b>of</b> their misbehaving? They {{certainly}} love flirting, as they also love dancing. But they flirt without mischief and without malice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, my dear; {{that must}} of course be quite understood.

6000|$|And {{a sudden}} resolve {{came into the}} mucker's mind as he whispered those words {{over and over again}} to himself. [...] "I can't have her," [...] he said.
