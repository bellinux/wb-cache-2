5|$|It {{has been}} {{highlighted}} that this elevation of principles of natural <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> constitutional status, with {{the implication that}} they may override local statutes due to the supremacy of the Constitution over them, creates some tension with Article 38 which vests the law-making power of Singapore in the legislature.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} critiques {{of the theory}} from several perspectives. Arguments include that it {{emphasizes}} <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> the exclusion of other moral values, such as caring; {{that there is such}} an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists studying them) of essentially intuitive decisions.|$|E

50|$|The first trailbaston {{commissions}} {{date back}} to 1305, when Edward I directed several teams of <b>justices</b> <b>to</b> visit each English county and seek presentments for felonies (homicide, theft, arson, and rape) and certain trespasses (premeditated assault, extortion, and violent disseisin). Edward I added conspiracy {{to the list of}} presentments in late 1305. In 1307 Edward I issued a revamped trailbaston commission that directed the <b>justices</b> <b>to</b> try assizes and deliver all prisoners in the counties they visited, not just those charged in previous trailbaston sessions. The 1307 trailbaston commission also directed <b>justices</b> <b>to</b> audit local compliance with the Statute of Winchester and to investigate local efforts to arrest felons.|$|R
5|$|A {{political}} party {{known as the}} South Indian Libertarian Federation (commonly referred to as Justice Party) was founded in 1916, principally to oppose {{the economic and political}} power of the Brahmin groups. The party's goal was to render social <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> the non-Brahmin groups. To gain the support of the masses, non-Brahmin politicians began propagating an ideology of equality among non-Brahmin castes. Brahmanical priesthood and Sanskritic social class-value hierarchy were blamed for the existence of inequalities among non-Brahmin caste groups.|$|E
5|$|After leaving office, Taft {{returned}} to Yale as a professor, continuing his political activity and working against war through the League to Enforce Peace. In 1921, President Harding appointed Taft as chief justice, an office {{he had long}} sought. Chief Justice Taft was a conservative on business issues, but under him, there were advances in individual rights. In poor health, he resigned in February 1930. After his death the next month, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, the first president and first Supreme Court <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> be interred there. Taft is generally listed near the middle in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E
5|$|After marrying {{his niece}} Martina and being crowned by the Patriarch, the 35-year-old Heraclius {{set out to}} perform his work as emperor. Phocas' brother, Comentiolus, {{commanded}} a sizable force in central Anatolia but was assassinated by the Armenian commander Justin, removing {{a major threat to}} Heraclius' reign. Still, transfer of the forces commanded by Comentiolus had been delayed, allowing the Persians to advance further in Anatolia. Trying to increase revenues and reduce costs, Heraclius limited the number of state-sponsored personnel of the Church in Constantinople by not paying new staff from the imperial fisc. He used ceremonies to legitimize his dynasty, and he secured a reputation for <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> strengthen his grip on power.|$|E
50|$|The Act {{controlled}} {{entry into}} the class of skilled workmen by providing a compulsory seven years' apprenticeship, reserved the superior trades for {{the sons of the}} better off, empowered <b>justices</b> <b>to</b> require unemployed artificers to work in husbandry, required permission for a workman to transfer from one employer to another and empowered <b>justices</b> <b>to</b> fix wage rates for virtually all classes of workmen.|$|R
50|$|The Supreme Court of the United States was {{established}} by the Constitution of the United States.Originally, the Judiciary Act of 1789 set the number of Justices at six. Subsequently, the United States Congress {{increased the number of}} <b>Justices</b> <b>to</b> seven in 1807, nine in 1837 and ten in 1863. The Judiciary Act of 1869 reduced the number of <b>Justices</b> <b>to</b> nine once again.|$|R

5|$|After {{the death}} of King Henry, Barre joined the service of William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely, who was justiciar and Lord Chancellor. Longchamp named Barre as Archdeacon of Ely, with the {{appointment}} occurring before 4 July 1190. Longchamp sent Barre as a royal <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> the counties near Ely in 1190. However, Longchamp was driven into exile in late 1191 owing to the hostility of the English nobility and Richard's brother Prince John during Richard's absence on the Third Crusade. Longchamp's exile meant that Barre did not serve as a royal justice again until King Richard I returned to England in 1194. Although Longchamp eventually returned to England, he {{did not return to}} his diocese, and much of the administration of Ely would have devolved on Barre during Longchamp's absence.|$|E
5|$|At his request, Ginsburg {{administered}} Vice President Al Gore's oath {{of office}} to a second term during the second presidential inauguration of Bill Clinton on January 20, 1997. She was the third woman to administer an inaugural {{oath of office}}. Ginsburg {{is believed to be}} the first Supreme Court <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> officiate a same sex-wedding, performing the August 31, 2013, ceremony of Kennedy Center President Michael Kaiser and John Roberts, a government economist. Earlier that summer, the Court had bolstered same-sex marriage rights in two separate cases. Ginsburg believed the issue being settled led same-sex couples to ask her to officiate as there was no longer the fear of compromising rulings on the issue.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge {{appointed}} one <b>justice</b> <b>to</b> the Supreme Court of the United States, Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925. Stone was Coolidge's fellow Amherst alumnus, a Wall Street {{lawyer and}} conservative Republican. Stone was serving as dean of Columbia Law School when Coolidge appointed {{him to be}} attorney general in 1924 to restore the reputation tarnished by Harding's Attorney General, Harry M. Daugherty. It does not appear that Coolidge considered appointing anyone other than Stone. Stone {{proved to be a}} firm believer in judicial restraint and was {{regarded as one of the}} court's three liberal justices who would often vote to uphold New Deal legislation. President Franklin D. Roosevelt later appointed Stone to be chief justice.|$|E
25|$|In 1866, at {{the behest}} of Chief Justice Chase, Congress passed an act {{providing}} that the next three <b>justices</b> <b>to</b> retire would not be replaced, which would thin the bench <b>to</b> seven <b>justices</b> by attrition. Consequently, one seat was removed in 1866 and a second in 1867. In 1869, however, the Circuit Judges Act returned the number of <b>justices</b> <b>to</b> nine, where it has since remained.|$|R
5|$|Clinton {{appointed}} two <b>justices</b> <b>to</b> the Supreme Court: Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993 and Stephen Breyer in 1994.|$|R

The president also appoints, with legislative approval, judges of the Court of Appeals.
