40|$|Basic rocks {{included}} in the Ossa–Morena/Central Iberian Variscan suture of SW Iberia have been studied in order to decipher the pre-orogenic evolution along this major boundary. These rocks appear as garnet-free amphibolites and garnetbearing amphibolites. Previous geochronological data on these basic rocks suggest the existence of two different protolith ages: Upper Precambrian and Lower Palaeozoic (Ordovician). Upper Precambrian amphibolites form small-size (up to several metres thick), lense-, dike- or elongated-shaped bodies, while Lower Palaeozoic ones form elongated bodies with thicknesses up to several <b>hectometres.</b> The chemical compositions of the amphibolites enable us to separate cumulate rocks from those representing more basaltic magmas. As for the originally basaltic rocks, their geochemical characteristics indicate a shallow melting with different proportions {{of at least three}} end-members, namely (i) a MORB-like asthenospheric source, (ii) a more enriched (plume-derived or subcontinental lithosphere) mantle source, and (iii) a continental crust component. Moreover, Upper Precambrian and Lower Palaeozoic amphibolites have different geochemical affinities. In the former group, we envisage an advanced intra-continental rifting situation or an intra-continental back-arc setting related to the Cadomian orogeny, while for the latter, we propose an environment of oceanic crust formation predating Variscan subduction and collision. The recognition of these remains of oceanic-affinity basic rocks along the OMZ/CIZ boundary allows us to propose that some sort of ocean may well have existe...|$|R
40|$|Amphibolites {{included}} in the Ossa-Morena/Central Iberian suture of SW Iberia offer the opportunity of investigating the subduction and collision events, followed by exhumation, which affected this major boundary during the Variscan orogeny. This suture contact {{is marked by a}} band of highly deformed and metamorphosed rocks, namely, the Central Unit. The main deformation affecting this unit is a ductile shearing that produced an intense planar–linear fabric. This shearing has two components: a dominant left lateral one and a subordinate dip-slip normal one, which can be taken to be responsible for the exhumation of this unit in Devonian–Carboniferous times. The rocks studied in the present paper are garnet-free amphibolites and garnet-bearing amphibolites intercalated between gneisses. They appear as lens-, dike- or elongated-shaped bodies, their thickness ranging between a metre and several <b>hectometres.</b> The investigation of their metamorphic evolution has been carried out by computing phase diagram sections (pseudosections) for specified bulk rock compositions. This method enables us to achieve a twofold goal: (i) to model the P–T path undergone by the rocks during the metamorphism in question, and (ii) to assess the influence of the fluid phase abundance on the formation and the preservation of the mineral assemblages {{as well as on the}} density decrease of the rocks during exhumation.

In the 1950s, he wanted to return to active studies {{but much of the}} field was already filled with very large and expensive instruments. Instead he turned to a field that was being largely ignored, that of medium frequency (<b>hectometre)</b> radio signals in the 0.5-3 MHz range, around the AM broadcast bands. However, signals with frequencies below 30 MHz are reflected by an ionized layer in the Earth's atmosphere called the ionosphere. In 1954, Reber moved to Tasmania, the southernmost state of Australia, where he worked with Bill Ellis at the University of Tasmania. There, on very cold, long, winter nights the ionosphere would, after many hours shielded from the sun's radiation by the bulk of the Earth, 'quieten' and de-ionize, allowing the longer radio waves into his antenna array. Reber described this as being a [...] "fortuitous situation". Tasmania also offered low levels of man-made radio noise, which permitted reception of the faint signals from outer space.|$|E

40|$|Exhumed {{basement}} {{rocks are}} often dissected by faults, the latter controlling physical parameters such as rock strength, porosity, or permeability. Knowledge on the three-dimensional (3 -D) {{geometry of the}} fault pattern and its continuation with depth is therefore of paramount importance for applied geology projects (e. g.  tunnelling, nuclear waste disposal) in crystalline bedrock. The central Aar massif (Central Switzerland) serves as a study area where we investigate the 3 -D geometry of the Alpine fault pattern by means of both surface (fieldwork and remote sensing) and underground ground (mapping of the Grimsel Test Site) information. The fault zone pattern consists of planar steep major faults (kilometre scale) interconnected with secondary relay faults (<b>hectometre</b> scale). Starting with surface data, we present a workflow for structural 3 -D modelling of the primary faults based on a comparison of three extrapolation approaches based on (a) field data, (b) Delaunay triangulation, and (c) a best-fitting moment of inertia analysis.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} of the National Hydrological Plan were the following: To improve the status {{of water in the}} public domain. To manage water supply and to meet present and future water demands through rational, sustainable, balanced and fair exploitation of water which will ensure a guaranteed sufficiency and quality of the resource for all uses, as well as long term protection of available water resources; To bring the availability of the resource into balance by protecting its quality and economising its use, in harmony with environment and other natural resources consideration. Regarding the last objective, the Plan proposed to solve the existing imbalances in water availability within the country through water transfers between different basins at an estimated cost of 6, 000 million euros (Melgarejo-Moreno, J., 2002). The article 13 of the Law authorised a transfer of up to a total of 1, 050 cubic <b>hectometres</b> (hm 3) per year from the Lower Ebro River Basin as follows: a) transfer of up to 190 hm 3 to the territory considered in the Catalonia Inland Basins Plan; b) transfer of up to 315 hm 3 to the territory considered in the Júcar Basin Plan; c) transfer of up to 450 hm 3 to the territory considered in the Segura Basin Plan; and, d) transfer of up to 95 hm 3 to the territory considered in the southern Basin Plan. Out of the 1, 050 hm 3 of water that could be transferred, 440 hm 3 would account for future urban and industrial uses, 340 hm 3 would eliminate the existing overdraft of groundwater by agricultural users, and 220 hm 3 would guarantee the supply for existing agricultural users (Melgarejo-Moreno, J., 2002). ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} terrain {{heterogeneities}} in one-point measurements is a continuous subject of discussion. Here {{we focus on}} the order of magnitude of the advection term in the equation of the evolution of temperature as generated by documented terrain heterogeneities and we estimate its importance as a term in the surface energy budget (SEB), for which the turbulent fluxes are computed using the eddy-correlation method. The heterogeneities are estimated from satellite and model fields for scales near 1  km or broader, while the smaller scales are estimated through direct measurements with remotely piloted aircraft and thermal cameras and also by high-resolution modelling. The variability of the surface temperature fields is not found to decrease clearly with increasing resolution, and consequently the advection term becomes more important as the scales become finer. The advection term provides non-significant values to the SEB at scales larger than a few kilometres. In contrast, surface heterogeneities at the metre scale yield large values of the advection, which are probably only significant in the first centimetres above the ground. The motions that seem to contribute significantly to the advection term in the SEB equation in our case are roughly those around the <b>hectometre</b> scales...|$|E
40|$|Chemical, textural, and isotopic {{heterogeneity}} within granitic magmas/rocks, and their extrusive equivalents, are common phenomena. This {{is to be}} expected since the source materials, from which the granitic magmas were created by partial melting, are themselves heterogeneous. Micro-sampling of feldspar crystals within granites has revealed complex internal Sr and Nd isotope variations thought to reveal subtle variations in the isotopic composition of the melt from which particular zones crystallised. These previous studies provide evidence of both macro-scale (regional) and micro-scale isotopic variation within granitic magmas. What is unknown is the scale and nature of chemical and isotopic variation occurring on the meso-scale (metre, decametre, <b>hectometre).</b> In this study, high-precision geochemical and isotopic (Sr, Nd, and O) data is obtained for spatially well-constrained samples, from three granitic intrusions from the UK, to study the scales over which isotope heterogeneities are preserved, and the maximum volumes of magma over which isotope and elemental homogenisation may have been achieved. This information provides important constraints on the physical and chemical characteristics of processes that occur during magma genesis, ascent, and emplacement. The regional-scale geochemical and {{isotopic heterogeneity}} in the Criffell pluton (SW Scotland) has been well documented and ascribed to 'incomplete hybridisation' between magmas derived from the melting of mantle and/or 'new' basic crust and metasediments.

40|$|Deep water fold {{and thrust}} belts (DWFTBs) are {{sedimentary}} wedges that accommodate plate-scale deformation on both active and passive continental margins. Internally, these wedges consist of individual structures that strongly influence sediment dispersal, bathymetry and fluid migration. Most DWFTB studies investigate basin- and intra-wedge- scale processes using seismic reflection profiles, yet are inherently limited by seismic resolution. Of critical importance is strain distribution and its accommodation on discrete faults compared to distributed deformation. Recent studies have considered strain distribution by investigating regional reflection DWFTBs profiles within coupled systems, which contain down-dip compression and up-dip extension. There is broad agreement of a mis-balance in compression versus extension, with ∼ 5 % excess {{in the latter}} associated with horizontal compaction, yet this remains unproven. Using two exceptionally well exposed outcrops in the Spanish Pyrenees we consider deformation of DWFTB at a scale comparable to, and beyond, seismic resolution for the first time. By coupling outcrop observations (decametre to <b>hectometre</b> scale) with a re-evaluation of seismic profiles from the Orange Basin, South Africa, which contains {{one of the best}} imaged DWFTBs globally, we provide a unique insight into the deformation from metre to margin scale. Our observations reveal hitherto unrecognised second order structures that account {{for the majority of the}} previously recognised missing strain. This re-evaluation implies that ∼ 5 % missing strain should be accounted for in all DWFTBs, therefore existing studies using restorations of the sediment wedge will have underestimated crustal shortening in active margins, or sedimentary shortening in gravity driven systems by this amount. In contrast to previous studies, our observations imply that the majority of this strain is accommodated on discrete fault surfaces and this can explain the occurrence and location of a range of intra-wedge processes that are intimately linked to structures including sediment dispersal, fluid migration pathways and reservoir compartmentalisation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work forms {{part of a}} {{more general}} {{research}} program GIIWS (ANR) lead by UPMC-Sorbonne Universités, dedicated to the evaluation of the hydrogeological potential of volcanic islands, and in particular of the occurrence of groundwater and/or freshwater aquifers in the Galapagos Archipelago, Ecuador. Indeed water resource problems there are rising very fast, in conjunction with the local economic development driven by the tourism industry. Drinkable water shortage and wastewater management problems have to be urgently faced. We focus here on the south-eastern part of Santa Cruz Island close to Puerto Ayora city, which benefited from a very exhaustive evaluation program. The island is formed by sequences of fractured basaltic lava flows, with some occurrence {{in the southern part of}} faulted zones of normal type, with opening and/or escarpments, which may reflect extensive periods. These zones, kilometric in size are known as grietas, and were favoured until now for water exploitation of the basal aquifer body. It was observed that these structures do not assemble at large into a connected network, but some of them may have a direct connection to the sea. At the <b>hectometre</b> scale, seismic refraction and P wave seismic velocity analysis has been used to characterize an effective medium away from grietas, with a mean crack density and an equivalent porosity. Both types of structures, cracks and faults, are embedded in a Discrete Fracture Network approach, and a number of numerical hydraulic experiments are performed to discuss various hydraulic observations (tidal attenuation at various locations) and to provide an estimation of their hydraulic properties. Piezometric levels that correspond to depth of the fresh/salted interface as delineated by low resistivity zones identified by heli-borne geophysical survey are also addressed. It comes out from our analysis that rock mass permeability might be in the range of 10 - 4 to 10 - 3 m/s, that the aquifer is not isotropic and might behave as a compartmentalized object being easily drained toward south east or south west by the large faulted zones of high diffusivity. It is therefore likely that recharge areas identified by rainfall gradients contribute to the basal aquifer recharge, but further inland than the location of Pozo Profundo deep well, and that these fresh water most probably migrates along fracture corridors delineated by faults toward the south-eastern shore line. Finally, we consider that these findings should help to define further drilling exploration phases...|$|E

Within the Dalbeattie Quarry granodiorite, subtle heterogeneity in initial ([sup] 87 Sr/[sup] 86 Sr) [sub] 397 Ma compositions exist (0. 70582 to 0. 70615), between samples collected ~ 150 m apart. The small-scale heterogeneity is outside of analytical error (± 0. 0001). [delta][sup] 18 O heterogeneity also occurs on similar small scales (~ 120 m), with values ranging from 8. 9 to 10. 7 %. The larger error on the [epsilon][sub]Nd(397 Ma) values do not allow any small-scale heterogeneity to be resolved. The geochemical and isotopic heterogeneity of the Cairnsmore of Fleet pluton, another Southern Upland granite, is also well known, and considered to be a result of similar processes to that of Criffell. This study demonstrates that the Cairnsmore granite is more petrographically variable in terms of grain-size, mafic/felsic mineral proportions, and accessory mineral assemblages over scales ranging between 100 and 350 m. The existence of more petrographic and geochemical heterogeneities on smaller scales suggests that homogenisation processes were less effective in this pluton compared to Criffell. On scales < 1 km, ([sup] 87 Sr/[sup] 86 Sr) [sub] 392 Ma compositions and [epsilon][sub]Nd(397 Ma) values are essentially homogeneous. Forest Track samples PAHCF 23 (0. 70796) and PAHCF 25 A (0. 70672) are ~ 1 km apart and can only just be distinguished outside of analytical error. However, [delta][sup] 18 O data demonstrate the existence of both regional-scale and locality-scale [delta][sup] 18 O heterogeneity on the 100 m, decametre and even cm-scale (8. 3 to 9. 7 % 0, error ± 0. 1 % 0). The two main granite varieties of the Dartmoor pluton (SW England) are generally, homogeneous in terms of their petrography and geochemistry on 100 m, decametre, meter and even cm scale. However, isotope heterogeneity, outside of analytical error is shown to exist on even the cm-scale. The samples PAHD 34 A and P AHD 34 B, from Blackenstone Quarry, have ([sup] 87 Sr/[sup] 86 Sr) [sub] 280 Ma compositions of O. 70949 and 0. 71292 respectively, and were collected 50 cm apart. Samples PAHD 35 A and PAHD 35 B have ([sup] 87 Sr/[sup] 86 Sr) [sub] 280 Ma compositions of 0. 70960 and 0. 71205, and were collected 100 cm apart. Variation in [delta][sup] 18 O and [epsilon][sub]Nd(280 Ma) values also exist. PAHD 34 A and PAHD 34 B have [delta][sup] 180 compositions of 10. 01 and 10. 98 % 0 (± 0. 1 % 0), and SNd(280 Ma) values of - 3. 8 and - 3. 3 (± 0. 2), respectively. Either the distinct magma batches, that coalesced to form the pluton, were much smaller in Dartmoor (compared to the Criffell and Cairnsmore plutons), or these heterogeneities may represent volumes of magma, within larger domains, that escaped homogenisation by mixing and diffusion. The existence of discrete, isotopically distinct batches of magma within the Criffell, Cairnsmore and Dartmoor plutons favours the dyke model for granitoid magma ascent through a pulsed magma delivery, in which separate magma batches (or pulses) coalesce to form plutons at or near their final emplacement levels. The scale over which such magma pulses can still be recognised varies within each pluton. The magma pulses are likely to have been larger in size, but subsequent homogenisation processes in the chambers led to a reduction in their size. However, homogenisation was not complete. In all three plutons, it is generally only the isotope ratios that display significant small-scale heterogeneity. Processes such as fractional crystallisation, are considered to be secondary, overprinting geochemical and isotopic heterogeneity from much deeper regions.
