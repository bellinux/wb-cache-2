A second or third subdivision level is referred to with another number each. Each numbering starts with 1, as 0 is used for the upper level. Where the subdivision has more than nine entities, capital letters are used to continue the numbering. A similar statistical system is defined for the candidate countries and members of the European Free Trade Association, but they are not technically part of NUTS governed by the regulations.|$|R

40|$|In this study, an {{analysis}} is performed to measure Puerto Rican citizens’ perceptions {{of environmental issues}} and global climate change (GCC). Puerto Rico (PR) is presently facing an economic crisis that began in 2010. In addition, the island has faced many extreme weather events that have greatly impacted the economy, including a dry period that lasted {{from the beginning of}} 2014 until the end of 2015 [1]. By replicating a study done in <b>Greece</b> (<b>GR),</b> [2] found that the citizens of PR are more informed about GCC (43 %) than Greeks (34 %). However, only 29 % of Puerto Ricans said they knew about the effects of greenhouse gases, as compared to 44 % of Greeks. The citizens of PR (67 %) and GR (91 %) claim they do not have confidence that their respective governments and agencies will be able to face GCC. In both cases, they have a higher confidence level in environmental organizations than in the scientific community. In PR, 89 % of the citizens are concerned about the degradation of natural resources. At 64 %, this concern is also significant in the case of GR, although the figure has decreased from previous years. Both countries place more responsibility in the hands of those in government and industry to take action on GCC. That being said, the people of GR have made it known they are willing to perform individual actions as well...|$|R
40|$|The {{past few}} years have been {{difficult}} for several countries in southern Europe and in the Middle East. Certain popular tourist destinations have confronted challenging times, which have had, inter alia, {{a negative impact on}} international tourist arrivals. Yet, globally, the travel and tourism sector has been growing steadily for years now. While some countries have been in distress, the whole macro environment has gone forward and the competition between nations has become fiercer than ever before, making nation branding a strategic instrument, not solely for attracting tourist, but also for attracting investments, exports and labor. The main {{purpose of the study was}} to find out how national tourism organizations, particularly the ones of Greece and Egypt would communicate online despite the unstable times they had been facing, and especially how they would deal with challenging and unpleasant matters in terms of rhetoric and communication. The answers were provided with the help of qualitative content analysis. The researcher did go through the official tourism websites of the two selected case countries and did analyze their content such as communication in the form of texts, images, symbols and videos. Only the English language versions of the sites were under inspection. The gathering of the data from the websites www. visitgreece. <b>gr</b> (Visit <b>Greece</b> | The Official website of the Greek Tourism Organisation) occurred between 17. 9 - 7. 12. 2016 and 4. 1. 2017 - 30. 3. 2017 for www. egypt. travel (Egyptian Tourism Authority). In order to ease the analyzing process and to produce an effortlessly approachable and decent looking study, parts of both websites were captured with the help of Snipping Tool. Likewise, a 27 inch Asus monitor with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels and the web browser Mozilla Firefox 49. 0. 2 were utilized for conducting the analysis. It was particularly interesting to become aware of how these national tourism organizations were reacting to these unfavorable circumstances they were facing for a rather long period of time. Fundamentally, in terms of information and message, the two websites were very similar. Overall, it could be said that the national tourism organizations under inspection did seem to communicate online essentially like any other commercial, private or governmental actor. And that, negative and potentially harmful matters were indecently left out at the detriment of transparency and honesty...|$|R

Methods: Forty-three consecutive LASIK cases treated with femtosecond laser flap and the WaveLight excimer platform were evaluated perioperatively for uncorrected visual acuity, best corrected spectacle visual acuity, refraction, keratometry, topography, total and flap pachymetry, corneal optical coherence tomography, and endothelial cell count. All eyes at the completion of LASIK had cross-linking through the repositioned flap, with higher fluence (10 mW/cm 2) ultraviolet light of an average 370 &micro;m wavelength and 10 mW/cm 2 fluence applied for 3 minutes following an earlier single instillation of 0. 1 % riboflavin within the flap interface. Mean follow-up duration was 3. 5 (range 1. 0 &ndash; 4. 5) years. Results: Mean uncorrected visual acuity changed from 0. 2 to 1. 2, best corrected spectacle visual acuity from 1. 1 to 1. 2, spherical equivalent from - 7. 5 diopters (D) to - 0. 2 D, keratometry from 44. 5 D to 38 D, flap pachymetry from 105 &micro;m to, total pachymetry from 525 to 405, and endothelial cell count from 2750 to 2800. None of the cases developed signs of ectasia or significant regression during follow-up. Conclusion: Prophylactic collagen cross-linking for high-risk LASIK cases appears to be a safe and effective adjunctive treatment for refractive regression and potential ectasia. This application may be viewed as prophylactic customization of the biomechanical behavior of corneal collagen.

Methods: Four cases were treated with a novel device employing very high-fluence collagen cross-linking applied in a myopic pattern. Prior to treatment, riboflavin solution was applied to the intact epithelium. The collagen cross-linking device was then engaged for a total of 12 J/cm 2, to be applied transepithelially in a predetermined pattern. Cornea clarity, corneal keratometry, and corneal topography were evaluated by both Placido disc and Scheimpflug imaging, along with cornea anterior segment optical coherence tomography and endothelial cell counts. Results: An average of 2. 3 diopters was achieved in the first week in all four cases treated with the very high-fluence myopic collagen cross-linking intervention. There was a slight regression to 1. 44 diopters at 1 month, which remained stable at 6 -month follow-up. The mean keratometry change was from 44. 90 diopters to 43. 46 diopters. There was no significant change in endothelial cell counts or corneal clarity. There was some mild change in epithelial thickness distribution, with the treated area showing a slight but homogeneous reduction in mean thickness from 52 µm to 44 µm. Conclusion: This report describes the novel application of very high-fluence collagen cross-linking with a predictable well defined myopic refractive (flattening) corneal effect. This technique has the advantages of essentially no postoperative morbidity, immediate visual rehabilitation, and the potential for tapering until the desired result is achieved.

40|$|Hyperaccumulation {{of nickel}} to {{concentrations}} above 1000 mg kg- 1 on a dry matter basis has become {{recognized as an}} unusual response by some plant species to the elevated nickel concentrations generally found in soils derived from ultramafi c rocks (oft en referred to as serpentine soils). Such soils are widespread in the Balkans. Th ese soils host some widespread species and {{a smaller number of}} regional or local endemics. Several serpentine areas in Albania (AL), Bulgaria (BG) and <b>Greece</b> (<b>GR)</b> have been surveyed {{because of the presence of}} nickel hyperaccumulating endemics, including some that are common for all three studied countries. Th e objectives of the study were to widen understanding of the distribution of the nickel hyperaccumulators and their uptake behaviour in relation to the characteristics of their native soil environments. Collection and chemical analysis of both plant and soil samples has allowed evaluation of phenotypic effi cacy in hyperaccumulating nickel. In total, eight taxa were studied. In this work the highest Ni concentrations in leaves (1. 5 - 2. 0 %) were found in Alyssum murale at Pojska (AL), A. murale at Kazak (BG), A. markgrafi i at Gjegjan (AL) and Th laspi kovatsii at Fotinovo (BG). Th e maximum quotients of plant Ni concentration to soil Ni concentration range from 13. 9 for A. markgrafi i to 6 - 7 for A. murale, T. kovatsii and T. tymphaeum from northern Greece. Eight of the taxa collected in this work show hyperaccumulation of Ni; these include A. murale subsp. pichleri and all of Th laspi species studied from serpentine in Bulgaria. In total, twenty-fi ve Ni hyperaccumulating taxa are now known from the Brassicaceae of Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. Because of its high biomass production, A. murale is likely to be the most suitable species for Ni phytomining in the Balkans...|$|R
40|$|I use a Global Positioning System (GPS) {{velocity}} field to constrain block {{models of the}} eastern Mediterranean and surrounding regions that account for the angular velocities of constituent blocks and elastic strain accumulation on block-bounding faults in the interseismic period. Kinematically consistent fault slip rates and locking depths are estimated by this method. Eleven blocks are considered, including the major plates, based largely on previous geodetic, seismic, and geologic studies: Eurasia (EU), Nubia (NU), Arabia (AR), Anatolia (AN), Caucasus (CA), South Aegea (AE), Central <b>Greece</b> (<b>GR),</b> North Aegea (NE), Southeast Aegea (SE), Macedonia (MA), and Adria (AD). Two models are presented, {{one in which the}} best-fitting locking depth for the entire region (- 15 km) is used on all boundaries (Model A), and one in which shallower locking depths are used on the Marmara Fault, the Hellenic and Cyprus Arcs, and in the Greater Caucasus (Model B), based on a consideration of locally best-fitting locking depths. An additional block, Black Sea (BS), is postulated in a third model. The models are in fair to good agreement with the results of previous studies of plate motion, fault slip rates, seismic moment rates and paleomagnetic rotations. Notably, some block pairs in the Aegean region have Euler poles on, or near to, their common boundaries, in qualitative agreement with so-called pinned block models, e. g., for the transfer of slip from the right-lateral North Anatolian Fault system to a set of left-lateral and normal faults in central and northern Greece (McKenzie and Jackson, 1983; Taymaz et al., 1991 a; Goldsworthy et al., 2002). (cont.) In addition, roughly three-quarters of the deformation in the Hellenic Arc and Greater Caucasus appears to be aseismic, in approximate agreement with previous studies (Jackson and McKenzie, 1988; Jackson, 1992). Increased data coverage will better constrain block motions, the locations of boundaries and the applicability of this method. by Shawn A. Lawrence. Thesis (S. M.)
