40|$|Bernal- and non-Bernal-stacked <b>graphene</b> <b>layers</b> {{have been}} {{systematically}} studied by Raman imaging and spectroscopy. Two dominant Raman modes, G and G' (or 2 D) of folded <b>graphene</b> <b>layers</b> exhibit {{three types of}} spectral features when interlayer lattice mismatches, defined by a rotational angle varies. Among these folded <b>graphene</b> <b>layers,</b> the most interesting one is the folded <b>graphene</b> <b>layers</b> that present an extremely strong G mode enhanced by a twist-induced Van Hove singularity. The evolution of Raman G and G' modes of such folded <b>graphene</b> <b>layers</b> are probed by changing the excitation photon energies. For the first time, doublet splitting of the G' mode in folded double-layer (1 + 1) and of the G mode in folded tetra-layer (2 + 2) graphene are clearly observed and discussed. The G' mode splitting in folded double-layer graphene is attributed to the coexistence of inner and outer scattering processes and the trigonal warping effect as well as further downwards bending of the inner dispersion branch at visible excitation energy. While the two peaks of the G mode in folded tetra-layer graphene are assigned to Raman-active mode (E 2 g) and lattice mismatch activated infrared-active mode (E 1 u), which is further verified by the temperature-dependent Raman measurements.

When the photodetector is exposed to light, excited hot electrons transitioned from the top <b>graphene</b> <b>layer</b> to the bottom, a process promoted by the structural asymmetry of the insulating Ta2O5 barrier. A consequence of the hot electron transition, the top layer accumulates positive charges and induces a photogating [...] effect on the lower <b>graphene</b> <b>layer,</b> which is measured as a change in current correlating with photon detection.
