40|$|Underground {{detectors}} {{are sensitive}} to extraterrestrial high energy neutrinos such as those from the decays of massive metastable cosmological relic particles predicted by new physical theories. We find that present data from the IMB and Fréjus nucleon decay experiments, together with data from the Fly's <b>Eye</b> air <b>shower</b> array, already set stringent constraints. If particles of mass ∼ 1 - 1014 TeV constitute the cosmological dark matter then their lifetime is bounded to be greater than ∼ 1014 - 1018 yr. These limits probe interesting regions in the parameter space of superstring-motivated models and extended technicolour models. © 1992...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{detection}} of a 51 Joule (3. 2 +/- 0. 9 x 10 ²⁰ eV) cosmic ray by the Fly's <b>Eye</b> air <b>shower</b> detector in Utah. This is substantially greater than the energy of any previously reported cosmic ray. A Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min cutoff of the energy spectrum (due to pion photoproduction energy losses) should occur below this energy unless the highest energy cosmic rays have traveled less than approximately 30 Mpc. The error box for the arrival direction in galactic coordinates is centered on b = 9. 6 deg, l = 163. 4 deg.

40|$|We derive {{constraints}} on the relic abundance of a generic particle of mass ∼ 1 - 10 ^ 14 TeV which decays into neutrinos at cosmological epochs, {{using data from the}} Fréjus and IMB nucleon decay detectors and the Fly's <b>Eye</b> air <b>shower</b> array. The lifetime of such unstable particles which may constitute the dark matter today is bounded to be greater than ∼ 10 ^ 14 - 10 ^ 18 yr, depending on the mass. For lifetimes shorter than the age of the universe, neutrino energy losses due to scattering and the expansion redshift become important and set limits to the ability of neutrino observatories to probe the early universe.

40|$|We {{propose that}} cosmic rays {{originate}} mainly in three sites, a) normal supernova explosions into the interstellar medium, b) supernova explosions into stellar winds, and c) hot spots of powerful radio galaxies. The proposal depends on an assumption about the scaling of the turbulent diffusive transport in cosmic ray mediated shock regions; the proposal also uses a specific {{model for the}} interstellar transport of cosmic rays. The model has been investigated in some detail and compared to i) the radio data of OB stars, Wolf Rayet stars, radio supernovae, radio supernova remnants, Gamma-ray line and continuum emission from starforming regions, and the cosmic ray electron spectrum, ii) the Akeno air shower data over the particle energy range from 10 TeV to EeV, and iii) the Akeno and Fly's <b>Eye</b> air <b>shower</b> data from 0. 1 EeV to above 100 EeV. Here we specifically discuss in some detail the assumptions inherent in the model proposed, concerning the transport of energetic particles, first in the acceleration region, and second in the Galaxy.

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} efficacies of punctal plug {{insertion}} and Botulinum toxin injection in dry eye disease not responding to topical medications. Materials and Methods: A non-controlled randomized clinical trial of two parallel groups of 60 dry eye patients {{seen in the}} clinic not responding to topical medications {{were divided into two}} groups. One group received punctal plugs and the other group received Botulinum toxin injections to prevent lacrimal tear drainage. Results: Of a total of 36 patients {{with a mean age of}} 44. 5 years who received punctal plugs, 50 % of them experienced improvements in the clinical manifestations of their disease. 12 / 36 (33. 3 %) developed plug extrusion, and 6 / 36 (16. 7 %) patients developed conjunctival erosions with irritation that necessitated plug removal within one week of insertion. A total of 24 patients with a mean age of 47. 5 years received injections of Botulinum toxin. Of these, 83. 3 % had improvement in all of the clinical manifestations of dry eye. 4 / 24 (16. 7 %) had no improvement in the degrees to which they experienced foreign body sensations, 33. 3 % reported shampoo entering the <b>eye</b> while <b>showering.</b> All of the patients who received Botulinum toxin injections were satisfied with the results of their treatment, whereas only 72. 3 % of the patients who received punctal plugs were satisfied with their results. Conclusion: Botulinum neurotoxin A injections can be a very good alternative to punctal plugs in improving the clinical manifestations of dry eye disease They are associated with the development of fewer and milder complications and with higher levels of patient satisfaction...|$|R
60|$|Autumn {{had melted}} into Indian summer, {{but it was}} still hot. With the {{perspiration}} dripping from me one afternoon, I whirled and drove the keen axe into a silver birch's side, seldom turning my <b>eyes</b> from the <b>shower</b> of white chips, because looking up between the slender stems one could see the black smoke of a thrasher streaking the prairie. The crops of the man who employed it had escaped damage, and as those of many had been spoiled by frost I knew he would reap a handsome profit on every bushel. I did not grudge it him, but the contrast with our failure troubled me. My throat was parched and dried up, for we had finished all the water they brought us in by train, and no man could drink of the shrunken creek, which was alkaline. It flowed down from one of those curious lakes to be found on the Western prairie, where clouds of biting dust which smarts one's eyes and nostrils intolerably rise up like smoke from the white crust about the margin of the waters, whose color is a vivid greenish blue.|$|R
6000|$|But what if {{all these}} forms are the {{descendants}} of one original form? Would that be one whit more wonderful, more inexplicable, than the theory that they were each and all, with their minute and often imaginary shades of difference, created separately and at once? But if it be--which I cannot allow--what can the theologian say, save that God's works are even more wonderful than we always believed them to be? As for the theory being impossible: who are we, that we should limit the power of God? 'Is anything too hard for the Lord?' asked the prophet of old; {{and we have a}} right to ask it as long as time shall last. If it be said that natural selection is too simple a cause to produce such fantastic variety: we always knew that God works by very simple, or seemingly simple, means; that the universe, as far as we could discern it, was one organisation of the most simple means; it was wonderful (or ought to have been) in our <b>eyes,</b> that a <b>shower</b> of rain should make the grass grow, and that the grass should become flesh, and the flesh food for the thinking brain of man; it was (or ought to have been) yet more wonderful in our eyes, that a child should resemble its parents, or even a butterfly resemble--if not always, still usually--its parents likewise. Ought God to appear less or more august in our eyes if we discover that His means are even simpler than we supposed? We hold Him to be almighty and allwise. Are we to reverence Him less or more if we find that His might is greater, His wisdom deeper, than we had ever dreamed? We believed that His care was over all His works; that His providence watched perpetually over the universe. [...] We were taught, some of us at least, by Holy Scripture, to believe that the whole history of the universe was made up of special providences: if, then, that should be true which Mr. Darwin says-- 'It may be metaphorically said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life,'--if this, I say, were proved to be true, ought God's care, God's providence, to seem less or more magnificent in our eyes? Of old it was said by Him without whom nothing is made--'My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.' Shall we quarrel with physical science, if she gives us evidence that these words are true? And if it should be proven that the gigantic Hura and the lowly Spurge sprang from one common ancestor, what would the orthodox theologian have to say to it, saving--'I always knew that God was great: and I am not surprised to find Him greater than I thought Him'? ...|$|R
6000|$|Such {{at least}} is the {{conclusion}} of one who, studying certain families of plants, which indulge in the most fantastic varieties of shape and size, and yet through all their vagaries retain - as do the Palms, the Orchids, the Euphorbiaceae - one organ, or form of organs, peculiar and highly specialized, yet constant throughout the whole of each family, has been driven {{to the belief that}} each of these three families, at least, has [...] "sported off" [...] from one common ancestor - one archetypal Palm, one archetypal Orchid, one archetypal Euphorbia, simple, it may be, in itself, but endowed with infinite possibilities of new and complex beauty, to be developed, not in it, but in its descendants. He has asked himself, sitting alone amid the boundless wealth of tropic forests, whether even then and there the great God might not be creating round him, slowly but surely, new forms of beauty? If he chose to do it, could He not do it? That man found himself none the worse Christian for the thought. He has said - and must be allowed to say again, for he sees no reason to alter his words - in speaking of the wonderful variety of forms in the Euphorbiaceae, from the weedy English Euphorbias, the Dog's Mercuries, and the Box, to the prickly-stemmed Scarlet Euphorbia of Madagascar, the succulent Cactus-like Euphorbias of the Canaries and elsewhere; the Gale-like Phyllanthus; the many-formed Crotons; the Hemp-like Maniocs, Physic-nuts, Castor-oils, the scarlet Poinsettia, the little pink and yellow Dalechampia, the poisonous Manchineel, and the gigantic Hura, or sandbox tree, of the West Indies, - all so different in shape and size, yet all alike in their most peculiar and complex fructification, and in their acrid milky juice,- [...] "What if all these forms are the descendants of one original form? Would that be one whit the more wonderful than the theory that they were, each and all, with the minute, and often imaginary, shades of difference between certain cognate species among them, created separately and at once? But if it be so - which I cannot allow - what would the theologian have to say, save that God's works are even more wonderful than he always believed them to be? As for the theory being impossible - that is to be decided by men of science, on strict experimental grounds. As for us theologians, who are we, that we should limit, à priori, the power of God? 'Is anything too hard for the Lord?' asked the prophet of old; and {{we have a right to}} ask it as long as the world shall last. If it be said that 'natural selection,' or, as Mr. Herbert Spencer better defines it, the 'survival of the fittest,' is too simple a cause to produce such fantastic variety - that, again, is a question to be settled exclusively by men of science, on their own grounds. We, meanwhile, always knew that God works by very simple, or seemingly simple, means; that the universe, as far as we could discern it, was one organization of the most simple means. It was wonderful - or should have been - in our <b>eyes,</b> that a <b>shower</b> of rain should make the grass grow, and that the grass should become flesh, and the flesh food for the thinking brain of man. It was - or ought to have been - more wonderful yet to us that a child should resemble its parents, or even a butterfly resemble, if not always, still usually, its parents likewise. Ought God to appear less or more august in our eyes if we discover that the means are even simpler than we supposed? We held Him to be Almighty and All-wise. Are we to reverence Him less or more if we find Him to be so much mightier, so much wiser, than we dreamed, that He can not only make all things, but - the very perfection of creative power - MAKE ALL THINGS MAKE THEMSELVES? We believed that His care was over all His works; that His providence worked perpetually over the universe. [...] We were taught - some of us at least - by Holy Scripture, that without Him not a sparrow fell to the ground, and that the very hairs of our head were all numbered; that the whole history of the universe was made up, in fact, of an infinite network of special providences. If, then, that should be true which a great naturalist writes, 'It may be metaphorically said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinizing, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being, in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life,' - if this, I say, were proved to be true, ought God's care and God's providence to seem less or more magnificent in our eyes?
