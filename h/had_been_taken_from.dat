5|$|In 985, Oswald invited Abbo of Fleury {{to come to}} Ramsey to help {{found the}} monastic school there. Abbo was at Ramsey from 985 to 987, where he taught computus, or the methods for calculating Easter. It was also often used in trying to {{calculate}} {{the date of the}} Last Judgment. A surviving manuscript gives a list compiled by Oswald, setting forth estates that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> the diocese of York.|$|E
5|$|A U.S. Weather Bureau Airport Station was {{established}} at the downtown Boise Airport, now the campus of Boise State University, on May 11, 1933 which is only about a 1-mile south of the U.S. Federal Building. Weather observations <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> the airport by the Bureau of Air Commerce personal since October 18, 1931. From July 1, 1939 to December 18, 1939, while the U.S. Weather Bureau office {{was moved to the}} airport at Gowen Field, official weather observations and one PIBAL flight a day were taken at the old airport.|$|E
5|$|Bentworth was {{the largest}} parish within the Hundred of Odiham, after Odiham itself. At {{the time of the}} Domesday Survey the area of the Hundred of Odiham were {{included}} in two separate hundreds, Odiham and Hefedele (also known as Edefele and Efedele). The former comprised Lasham and Shalden and half a hide which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> the nearby village of Preston Candover, and the latter included Odiham, Winchfield, Elvetham, Dogmersfield, and a former parish named Berchelei. For the manors of Bentworth, Greywell, Hartley Wintney, Liss, Sherfield-upon-Loddon, and Weston Patrick, there are no entries in the Survey, but they were believed to have been included in the large manor of Odiham.|$|E

50|$|The name Kokernag <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{derived from}} the two words namely, koker and nag. Koker <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> a Kashmiri word for chicken, while nag <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> Sanskrit word for springs. Kokernag is {{situated}} in the Anantnag District, whose name means abundant springs.|$|R

5|$|Cumberland's {{neighbour}} club Western Suburbs {{had used}} {{black and white}} as their colours, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> Ashfield rugby club, a second grade rugby union team which supplied many of Western Suburbs players. Unlike other clubs, Western Suburbs did not take their colours from their district rugby union team, due to Ashfield's influence at the club. Cumberland thought of using the bottle green of the Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club, as many of their team members were from there. However, the club believed that some {{would be unable to}} distinguish Western Suburbs and Cumberland if this approach was taken.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate army {{made several}} other {{attempts}} {{to cross the}} trench during the night but repeatedly failed. Although the confederates could have deployed their infantry over the whole length of the trench, they were unwilling to engage the Muslims at close quarter as the former regarded the latter as superior in hand-to-hand fighting. As the Muslim army was well dug in behind the embankment made from the earth which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> the ditch and prepared to bombard attackers with stones and arrows, any attack could cause great casualties.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean People's Army {{forces were}} {{organized}} into a mechanized combined arms force of ten divisions, originally numbering some 90,000 well-trained and well-equipped troops in July, {{with hundreds of}} T-34 Tanks. However, defensive actions by U.S. and South Korean forces had delayed the North Koreans significantly in their invasion of South Korea, costing them 58,000 of their troops {{and a large number}} of tanks. In order to recoup these losses, the North Koreans had to rely on less experienced replacements and conscripts, many of whom <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> the conquered regions of South Korea.|$|E

5|$|While {{waiting for}} an {{opportunity}} to launch this operation, the Alsos Mission learned that uranium ore that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> Belgium in 1944 had been shipped to the Wirtschaftliche Forschungsgesellschaft (WiFO) plant in Stassfurt, which was captured by the 83rd Infantry Division on 15 April. As it was in the occupation zone allocated to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference, the Alsos Mission, led by Boris Pash and accompanied by Lansdale, arrived on 17 April to remove anything of interest. Over the following ten days, 260 truckloads of uranium ore, sodium uranate and ferro-uranium weighing about 1,000 tons were taken away.|$|E
5|$|From April, Marquis began {{collecting}} artifacts of the Custer battle. He visited Cheyennes to buy objects that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> the dead soldiers, particularly weapons. According to Weist, {{the fact that}} the Cheyennes would even admit that they had these objects was a measure of the trust Marquis had earned. Marquis also collected Cheyenne objects, including scalping knives. After attending the annual Sun Dance in Lame Deer, Marquis moved to Hardin, somewhat closer to the Custer battlefield. Marquis' presence at that Sun Dance, and at others held in subsequent years until 1931, was another measure of the Cheyennes' trust. The Sun Dance (called by the Cheyenne the Great Medicine dance) had earlier been made illegal by the Federal Government; 1927 was the first year they had been allowed to hold it openly. It was still disapproved of, and practicing Indian medicine was a jailable offense.|$|E
5|$|The Alsos Mission {{had learned}} that the uranium ores that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> Belgium in 1944 had been shipped to the Wirtschaftliche Forschungsgesellschaft (WiFO) plant in Staßfurt. The 83rd Infantry Division {{captured}} this on 15 April. As {{it was in the}} occupation zone allocated to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference, the Alsos Mission, led by Pash and accompanied by Lansdale, Perrin and Air Commodore Sir Charles Hambro, arrived on 17 April to remove anything of interest. Over the following ten days, 260 truckloads of uranium ore, sodium uranate and ferrouranium weighing about 1,000 tons, were taken away by an African-American truck company. The uranium was taken to Hildesheim and most of it was flown to the United Kingdom by the Royal Air Force; the rest had to be moved to Antwerp by train and loaded onto a ship to England.|$|E

5|$|Bruce was {{followed}} by Lawrence N. Maxwell, counsel for Beckham. Maxwell reiterated that the General Assembly had acted within its enumerated powers under the state constitution in deciding {{the outcome of the}} disputed election. He claimed that the decision of the state court of appeals made it clear that Taylor had not been legally elected governor, and therefore never possessed the property he was now claiming <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> him without due process. Maxwell further asserted that this disposed of any federal questions with regard to the case, and that the Supreme Court could claim no jurisdiction. The decision of the state court of appeals should be allowed to stand, he concluded. Lewis McQuown further argued on behalf of Beckham that, even if Taylor's claim to the governorship were legitimate, the investigation and decision by the General Assembly's contest committee represented sufficient due process. He acknowledged that the Goebel Election Law's provision that the legislature be the arbiter of any contested gubernatorial election differed little if at all from provisions in as many as twenty other states. If the Goebel Election Law was constitutional, as it had before been declared, then the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction regarding how it had been administered.|$|E
5|$|The {{first five}} seasons {{of the series}} were mainly filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia; {{production}} of the show's sixth season, however, was based in Los Angeles, California. Several of the scenes were filmed on the sets from NYPD Blue, whose sets were located just across from The X-Files studios. All of Fellig's cameras were borrowed from the University of California's Museum of Photography. Many of the photographs were used courtesy of Corbis. The production staff of The X-Files were tasked with not only creating the photographs that Fellig {{was supposed to have}} taken, but also with crafting each so that they would appear as if they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> different times. Tom Day, the episodes property master, had to research popular government typefaces and printing technologies to make the pictures appear as historically accurate as possible. Geoffrey Lewis, who portrayed Fellig, was photographed several times and each photo was edited to give the photographs the appearance of coming from different eras.|$|E

5|$|Pope Pius II's {{crusade against}} the Ottoman Empire was {{declared}} in November 1463. Skanderbeg, {{the leader of}} the Albanians, was a vital ally to this effort and would have become one of its main leaders. The Venetians, who had also joined the crusade, could not persuade Lekë Dukagjini, Skanderbeg's lukewarm ally in northern Albania, to join until the pope intervened. Furthermore, the major European powers were reluctant to join the pope's crusade. Among those inquired were the city of Florence, Francisco Sforza of Milan, Louis XI of France, and Ferdinand I of Naples, all of whom declined for their own reasons. The Republic of Venice, however, decided to aid Skanderbeg by sending 500 cavalry and 500 infantry under the condottiero Antonio da Cosenza, also known as Cimarosto. Once the campaign season began, Mathias Corvinus of Hungary recaptured many of the Bosnian strongpoints, including Jajce, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> the Kingdom of Bosnia by the Ottomans. Mehmed II marched into Bosnia, pillaging the countryside, hoping that his enemies would surrender. The Hungarian resistance, however, was stiff. The Ottomans still managed to make headway against the Hungarians who had been trying to lift Ottoman the siege on Jajce with a ruse. The Sultan continued his siege while Mathias escaped from the fortress with a force of men, but the retreating army was harried with two-hundred soldiers being captured and sent to Constantinople for execution. Despite the setback, Jajce held out and Mehmed retreated from Bosnia.|$|E
