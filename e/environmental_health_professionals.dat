In this way, it is demonstrably closely linked with public <b>health.</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>health</b> is also generally regarded as a key core competency area in public health education (ANAPHI 2001), and also noted as a key component of courses in related fields, such as occupational health (Leggat 2001). None-the-less, much of <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> is perceived to be regulatory and somewhat separate from public health (Kotchian 1997).

40|$|Background. Appalachia is {{a region}} of the United States that faces {{significant}} environmental and health disparities. Understanding these disparities and the social determinants that contribute to them will help public health practitioners make better decisions. The purpose {{of this research is}} two-fold. First, through secondary data analysis, we document environmental and health disparities as well as demographic and economic conditions that may contribute to these disparities between Appalachian and non-Appalachian Ohio. Second, we examine perceptions of environmental health practitioners about the differences in environmental conditions between Appalachian and non-Appalachian Ohio. Methods. We gathered secondary data about economics, health, and the environment from the Ohio Department of Health, Healthy Ohio Community Profiles, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the U. S. Census. In addition, we conducted an online survey of 76 <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> <b>professionals</b> across Ohio. Results. The secondary data indicates that there are significant differences between Appalachian and non-Appalachian Ohio in terms of socioeconomic, health, and environmental indicators.

40|$|Chronic {{beryllium}} disease (CBD) is typically considered only when occupational exposure to beryllium is a certainty; however, CBD has also occurred in occupational and environmental settings where exposure was unexpected. When {{the etiology of}} a case of granulomatous pulmonary disease is not determined, sarcoidosis is the "diagnosis of exclusion.

The granulomatous changes of sarcoidosis are thought to result from an abnormal immune response. While the etiologic agents that can initiate this response are largely unknown, the immunopathogenesis of CBD has been well described, and laboratory methods are available in a few centers that can (if used) identify beryllium hypersensitivity.
