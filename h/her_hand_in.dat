5|$|After {{graduate}} school Ahn moved to Seattle {{and worked as}} a psychotherapist. In late 2002 he was dismissed from his job as the supervisor of a group home for at-risk youth in Seattle, after one of the residents accused him of hugging her and holding <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>In</b> a 2013 retrospective he penned for news portal Rappler, Ahn contended that her allegations were false; made in retaliation for his sanctioning her with loss of privileges for illegal possession of a controlled substance. Thereafter he left the social services and found work in retail management.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{remained}} {{close to}} Dudley and he, with her blessing {{and on her}} prompting, pursued his suit for <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> an atmosphere of diplomatic intrigue. His wife's and his father's shadows haunted his prospects. His efforts leading nowhere, {{in the spring of}} 1561 Dudley offered to leave England to seek military adventures abroad; Elizabeth would have none of that and everything remained as it was.|$|E
5|$|In {{the smaller}} painting, Mary averts {{her eyes and}} folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised {{submission}} to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. In this painting, the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.|$|E

5|$|Three years later, Stone {{followed}} Kelley’s example. In 1843, a deacon {{was expelled}} from Stone's church for his antislavery activities, which included supporting Kelley by hosting her at his home and driving her to lectures that she gave in the vicinity. When the first vote for expulsion was taken, Stone raised <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> his defense. The minister discounted her vote, saying that, though {{she was a member}} of the church, she was not a voting member. Like Kelley, she stubbornly raised her hand for each of the remaining five votes.|$|E
5|$|When {{she was old}} enough, she {{attended}} social events and soon met a young Jewish man. He asked her father for <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> marriage, and the father agreed {{on the condition that}} the man take out life insurance. While Emilia was planning the wedding, her fiancé attended doctor's appointments as part of the insurance underwriting process. There he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and told {{that he did not have}} long to live. The wedding was cancelled, and Baeyertz suffered a breakdown and ill health as a result.|$|E
5|$|As Feodora grew older, various suitors were {{considered}} for marriage. The exiled Prince Peter Karađorđević, thirty-six years her senior, unsuccessfully requested <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> marriage. Another potential candidate was her cousin Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In late 1897, Feodora became engaged to Prince Henry XXX of Reuss, and they married the following year, on 24 September 1898 in a Lutheran ceremony at Breslau. The groom was fifteen {{years older than}} his bride and a captain in a Brunswick regiment, but not wealthy or particularly high-ranked. Many in the family were shocked at the marriage, but the Dowager Empress was at least pleased that her granddaughter seemed happy with the match.|$|E

5|$|After this, Baker {{appeared}} in the independent British-German film Station Six-Sahara (1962) {{as a woman who}} provokes tensions at an oil station in the Sahara Desert, as well as the blockbuster Western epic How the West Was Won (1962), opposite Debbie Reynolds and former co-stars Gregory Peck and Karl Malden. In addition to film acting, Baker also found time to appear again on Broadway, starring in the 1962 production of Garson Kanin's Come on Strong in the fall of that year. In 1963, Baker relocated permanently with then-husband Jack Garfein and their two children to Los Angeles, where she based herself for the next several years. She traveled to Kenya to film Mister Moses (1965), where publicized rumors spread that she and co-star Robert Mitchum were having an affair, which they both vehemently denied. Another story, now considered apocryphal, had it that a Maasai chief in Kenya offered 150 cows, 200 goats, sheep, and $750 for <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> marriage. She subsequently appeared with Maasai warriors on the cover of Lifes July 1964 issue.|$|E

25|$|According to {{scholars}} like Tirmidhī and Ḥārith b. Hishām, however, {{all of a}} woman's body is awrah, including her face, hands, and even fingernails. There is a dispensation though that allows a woman to expose her face and hands, e.g. when asking for <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> marriage, {{because it is the}} centre of beauty.|$|E
25|$|Joplin became {{engaged to}} Peter de Blanc {{in the fall}} of 1965. She had begun a {{relationship}} with him toward the end of her first stint in San Francisco. Now living in New York where he worked with IBM computers, he visited her to ask her father for <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> marriage. Joplin and her mother began planning the wedding.

25|$|In her youth, she was {{abducted}} by Theseus. A competition between her suitors for <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> marriage sees Menelaus emerge victorious. An oath sworn beforehand {{by all the}} suitors (known as the Oath of Tyndareus) requires them to provide military assistance {{in the case of}} her abduction; this oath culminates in the Trojan War. When she marries Menelaus she is still very young; whether her subsequent involvement with Paris is an abduction or a seduction is ambiguous.|$|E

25|$|The film follows Tristan, a {{young man}} from the fictional town of Wall. Wall is a town on the border of the magical fantasy kingdom of Stormhold.

25|$|On 27 June 1960, Kohl married Hannelore Renner, {{after he}} had already asked for <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> {{marriage}} in 1953, delaying the ceremony until he was financially stable. Both {{had known each other}} since 1948, when they met in a dancing class. They had two sons, Walter Kohl (born 1963) and Peter Kohl (born 1965). Hannelore Kohl had studied languages and spoke fluent French and English; during her husband's political career, she was an important adviser to him, especially on world affairs. She was a steadfast advocate of German reunification even before it seemed feasible, and of NATO and Germany's alliance with the United States.|$|E
25|$|Following Cameron's resignation, May won an unchallenged {{leadership}} {{election in}} July 2016, and was appointed Prime Minister, becoming the second woman {{to hold this}} position, after Margaret Thatcher. As Prime Minister, May began the process of withdrawing the UK from the European Union, triggering Article 50 in March 2017. In April 2017, May announced an early general election in June, {{with the aim of}} strengthening <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> Brexit negotiations. This resulted in a hung parliament, in which the number of Conservative seats fell from 330 to 317, prompting her to broker a confidence and supply deal with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to support May's minority government.|$|E
