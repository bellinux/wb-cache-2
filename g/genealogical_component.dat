30|$|Turkish {{citizenship}} {{is defined in}} the Article 66 of the constitution by the statement that ‘Everybody linked to the Turkish state with a citizenship bond is Turk’, also codifying the birthright acquisition of citizenship through that of parents. Provisions of the Citizenship Law refers to jus soli only under special circumstances, {{and there is no}} restriction on jus sanguinis transmission abroad. With a strong <b>genealogical</b> <b>component,</b> the ethno-cultural conception of Turkish citizenship seems at odds with the republican premises of the constitution (Kasaba, 1997; Kirisci, 2000). Turkish citizenship can thus be understood in terms of its monolithic character assuming a unique identity, constituted on republican but state-centric premises, and culturally embedded in the national identity (Içduygu, Çolak, & Soyarik, 1999; Soyarik-Sentürk, 2005). While these aspects mark a continuity in the citizenship regime, major changes have resulted from this official understanding of national identity and the emerging need to address the new conditions created by emigration (Kadirbeyoglu, 2007, 2009). Therefore, the acceptance of dual {{citizenship is}} completely compatible with the general character of Turkish citizenship; given the ethno-cultural conception, a re-ethnicisation was not necessary since retaining this conception was sufficient.|$|E
