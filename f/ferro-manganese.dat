Three sheets of <b>Ferro-manganese</b> oxide in a matrix of red clay {{were included in the}} 73 m core. Although the concentration of 232 Th of land origin is normal as compared with that of the usual red clay or of the sediment obtained at the neighboring station, the concentration of radiogenic 230 Th is extremely low and does not decrease with increasing depth. The radioactivity of rather soluble 226 Ra at the station is not less than that of 230 Th in the surface sediment, showing a tendency different from that observed in usual cores. Some enrichment in the comparatively short-lived 210 Pb activity relative to 226 Ra activity was found in the top sediment and in the first <b>ferro-manganese</b> sheet at the station. If the excess 210 Pb in the <b>ferro-manganese</b> sheet is not due to contamination of the surface sediment, lead should migrate through the sheet.

Here we compare Nd isotopic measurements obtained from ferromanganese oxides leached from bulk sediments and planktonic foraminifera, {{as well as from}} oxidatively-reductively cleaned foraminiferal shells from sediment cores in the North Atlantic. Sedimentary volcanic ash contributes a significant fraction of the Nd when the <b>ferro-manganese</b> (Fe-Mn) oxide coatings are leached from bulk sediments. Reductive leachates of marine sediments from North Atlantic core tops near Iceland, or directly downstream from Iceland-Scotland Overflow Waters, record ɛNd values that are significantly higher than seawater, indicating that volcanic material is easily leached by acid-reductive methods. The ɛNd values from sites more distal to Iceland are similar to modern seawater values, showing little contamination from Iceland-derived volcanogenic material.

Pumice is rhyolitic, with high content of silica and total alkalis and show strong light rare earth element enrichment, with La ~ 100 times enriched compared to chondritic abundance and exhibits a pronounced negative Eu-anomaly. Both the partially and fully coated pumice clasts have a similar composition, but this, and their, glass and mineral (orthopyroxene) chemistry differs from all tuffs known to have erupted from the Toba Caldera Complex.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{requirement}} for high carbon <b>ferro-manganese</b> (HCFeMn), which is the key product of our company, has increased due to bullish demand for steel products. In our Tokushima works, we have 2 closed types of electric furnaces (1 F and 2 F), with which we are man-ufacturing HCFeMn. In {{order to meet the}} increase in demand, we made various modifications to these fur-naces and we tried to increase the furnace operating loads. Especially for 1 F, we deepened the furnace. In this paper, we report the results of this modification. The operational situations of the above-mentioned two furnaces are different because they have different individual profiles. As for 1 F prior to modification, the depth of the furnace was one meter shallower than 2 F, because 1 F was designed for the manufacturing of SiMn. On the other hand, our Tokushima works spe-cialized in HCFeMn 14 years ago. However, the profile of 1 F was not optimized for HCFeMn. In comparison to 2 F, 1 F was more difficult to stabilize due to the smaller tolerance for the adjustment of the electrode length, the metal / slag level, and the coke-mixing ratio. We deepened 1 F by 770 mm by disposing of the furnace rolling mechanism. We consequently achieved a 10 % increase in production capacity. This meant the operating load was en-hanced from 24. 5 MW to 27 MW, the furnace became more stable and the tapping speed of both metal and slag increased, all which made the tapping easier than before. 1...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} a high-resolution record of osmium and thallium isotopes in a <b>ferro-manganese</b> (Fe-Mn) crust from the Indian Ocean, Antipode 109 D-C. These results, {{when combined with}} additional new Os isotope data from ODP Hole 756 B in the southeast Indian Ocean, define a new best estimate for the age {{at the base of}} this crust of ~ 6. 5 Ma, which is significantly different from a previous estimate of ~ 15 Ma based on Co-flux modeling. The Tl isotope record obtained for the Indian Ocean resembles that for the Pacific Ocean with a small but well-defined increase occurring over the last ~ 5 Myr. This contrasts with two records from the Atlantic Ocean which do not have resolvable variations. Ocean basin-scale Tl isotope variation may be inconsistent with the inferred modern marine residence time for Tl of ~ 20 kyr but could be explained by an increase in ocean crust production rates in the Pacific and Indian oceans since ~ 10 Ma. The improved age model for 109 D-C reveals that the Hf isotope composition of Indian Ocean bottom waters has remained homogenous over the last ~ 6 Myr. Thus, this isotope system does not bear any evidence that the influence of North Atlantic Deep Water in the formation of Indian Ocean bottom waters has changed during that time.

40|$|Decline of XVIII century brought {{interest}} the region o i Russia named later the Coal-basin Donieck. One {{of the first}} {{who were interested in}} this region was the omnipotent minister Russian tzarina Catherine II, duke Grigorij Aleksandrowich Potiomkin. However, the actors of technology and communication made the development of heavy industry impossible at this area. The geological investigations led to discovery of ledges of pit-coal and coking-coal on the territory of Donieck in 1790. The government initiatives concerning the development of region of Donieck based on local dePosits of pit-coal and iron-stone failed. Situation of private investments was similar. Factories of "Noworossyjskie Company” (British capital) and Pastuchow’s (Russian capital) founded in the Coal-basin of Donieck functioned only with support of subsidies of the government. The economic torpor of southern Russia ended {{in the second half of}} 1870 s. It was caused discovery of the deposits of high-quality iron-stone in area or Krivoi Rog by local businessman Alexander Pohl. The change of economic doctrine of Russian Empire in 1877 caused the inflow or foreign capitals into the region. The govemement made foreign investors locate huge means for building modern railway lines. They connected southhern Russia with leading markets of Russian Empire. The true investment boom in southern Russia took place atter 1886 when government increased custom duties for iron and import became unprofitable. Period of economic situation or 1890 s led to development of region of “Niz Dnieprowski” and “the Coasts or Azov See”. All the investments in southern Russia were based on estimated data about deposits or high-grade iron-stone of Krivoi Rog. Using up or the richest deposits of iron-stone in area of Krivoi Rog caused that exploitation of worse iron-stone of Kercz region begun in 1898. The profits generated by joint-stock companies in southern Russia let them introduce newest technologies. The southern region or Russian Empire was the most modern centre of industry. This caused using the by-products and development of chemical industry there. In the middle of 1890 s there was a great technological difference between the mining of iron-stone of Krivoi Rog and coal-mining of the Coal-basin of Donieck. It was the result of shallow and rich deposits of pit-coal in the Coal-basin of Donieck. Using up of these deposits caused that in the middle of 1890 s the modern technological solutions in coal mining were introduced. In the same period the modern systems of iron-stone mining functioned exclusively in Krovoi Rog. The dynamic development of production of steel and steel rails in southern Russia caused demand for <b>ferro-manganese</b> and matcrrial mirror. Russia was world largest manufacturer of manganic ore. The largest deposits were in district of Kutay and Ekaterynoslaw (nikopolska and caucasian ore). In the middle of 1890 s in southern Russia the production of <b>ferro-manganese</b> and material mirror was started. As the result of foreign capital investments the southern centre fransformed into the largest complex of heavy industry in Russia. In years 1870 - 1900 the coal production increased from 32, 8 to 69, 5 % and output of iron-stone form 2, 8 to 57, 2 %. In the same period the production of pig-iron increased from 1, 4 to 51, 8 %.

MethodsChronic (22 ̆ 030510 years) exposure to ambient air Mn in adult residents and effects on neuropsychological and neurological outcomes were investigated.

Adult Mn-exposed residents 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 psychomotor ability was assessed using Finger Tapping, Hand Dynamometer, Grooved Pegboard, and the Computerized Adaptive Testing System (CATSYS) Tremor system. Bayesian structural equation modeling was used to assess associations between air-Mn and motor function and tremor. ResultsAir-Mn exposure was significantly correlated in bivariate analyses with the tremor test (CATSYS) for intensity, center frequency and harmonic index. The Bayesian path analysis model showed associations of air-Mn with the CATSYS non-dominant center frequency and harmonic index; while the Bayesian structural equation model revealed associations between air-Mn and lower Finger Tapping scores. Household income was significantly associated with motor dysfunction but not with tremor. ConclusionTremor and motor function were associated with higher exposure to airborne Mn.

40|$|We {{investigated}} surficial sediments for physico-chemical composition {{from numerous}} sites of seven study {{areas in the}} manganese nodule field of the northern Peru Basin {{as part of a}} deep-sea environmental study. Major results from this study are strong variability with respect to water depth, productivity in surface waters, locality, bottom water flow, and seafloor topography. Sediment sites are located mostly in 3900 to 4300 m water depth between the lysocline and the carbonate compensation depth (CCD). Large fluctuations in carbonate content (0 % to 80 %) determine sediment density and compressional-wave velocity, and, by dilution, contents of opal and non-biogenic material. Mass accumulation rates of biogenic components as well as geochemical proxies (barium and phosphorus) distinguish areas of higher productivity in the northwest near equatorial upwelling and in the northeast close to coastal upwelling, from areas of lower productivity in the west and south. Comparisons between the central Peru Basin area (Discol) and western Peru Basin area (Sediperu) reveals, for the Sediperu area, a shallower CCD, more carbonate but less opal, organic carbon, and non-biogenic material in sediments at the same water depth as well as larger down-core fluctuations of organic carbon and MnO 2. Bottom water flow in the abyssal hill topography causes winnowing of material from summits of seamounts and ridges, where organic carbon preservation is poor, to basins where organic carbon preservation is better. Down-core measurements in box cores indicate a three-fold division in the upper 50 cm of the sediment column. An uppermost semi-liquid top layer is dark brown, 5 - 15 cm thick and contains most of the <b>ferro-manganese</b> nodules.

40|$|Bowie Seamount, a {{submerged}} volcano situated off {{the west}} coast of Canada at 53 ° 18; N, 135 ° 39 ' W, has a relief of 10, 000 ft. and comes to within 100 ft. of the ocean surface. It is made up of a series of intersecting ridges which together give the mountain an overall northeast - southwest elongation. It appears to be a combination central and fissure type volcano which has been built up over a system of intersecting fractures in the oceanic crust. Two terraces form the flattened summit of the volcano at approximate depths of 45 and 130 fathoms. These are thought to be the remains of platforms produced by combined wave erosion and shallow-water vulcanism during late Quaternary time when sea level was lower than it is today. The last phase of volcanic activity on the summit occurred after the formation of the upper terrace no more than 18, 000 years ago. Samples dredged from the upper half of the volcano include: pillow fragments, fragments of non-pillowed flows, pillow breccias, bombs, tuffs, ash, and unsorted tephra. The rocks are mainly alkali olivine basalts, accompanied by rare andesites which, presumably, were derived by differentiation of the basaltic magma.

Analysis of enrichment factors revealed an anthropogenic origin of most of the studied elements; Zn, Cd, Mo, Pb and Cu were the most enriched elements at the three sites, with Fe and V as the least enriched elements. Positive Matrix Factorisation (PMF) and pollutant roses (Cu at TORR, Zn at CORR and Mn at GUAR) were used to identify the local sources of the studied metals. Analysis of PMF results revealed the main sources of trace metals at each site as road traffic at the TORR site, iron foundry and casting industry at the CORR site and a <b>ferro-manganese</b> alloy industry at the GUAR site. Other sources were also identified at these sites, but with much lower contributions, such as minor industrial sources, combustion and traffic mixed with the previous sources.

40|$|Austenitic {{steel is}} {{one type of}} {{stainless}} steel which is widely used in the industry. Many studies on  austenitic stainless  steel have been performed to determine the physicalproperties using various types of equipment and methods. In this  study, the neutron diffraction method is used to characterize the materials which have been made from  minerals extracted  from the mines in Indonesia. The materials consist of a granular ferro-scrap, nickel, ferro-chrome, <b>ferro-manganese,</b> and  ferro-silicon added with a little titanium. Characterization of the materials {{was carried out in}} threeprocesses, namely:  machining, annealing, and rolling. Experimental results obtained from the machining process generally produces a texture  in the 〈 100 〉direction. From the machining to annealing process, the texture index decreases from 3. 0164 to 2. 434. Texture  strength in the machining process (BA 2 N sample) is   8. 13 mrd and it then decreases to 6. 99 in the annealing process  (A 2 DO sample). In the annealing process the three-component texture appears, cube-on-edge type texture{ 110 }〈 001 〉,  cube-type texture { 001 }〈 100 〉, and brass-type { 110 }〈 112 〉. The texture is very strong leading to the direction of orientation  { 100 }〈 001 〉, while the { 011 }〈 100 〉is weaker than that of the { 001 }, and texture withorientation { 110 }〈 112 〉is weak. In  the annealing process stress release occurred, and this was shown by more randomly pole compared to stress release by  the machining process. In the rolling process a brass-type texture{ 110 }〈 112 〉with a spread towards the goss-type texture  { 110 }〈 001 〉 appeared,  and  the  brass  component  is markedly  reinforced  compared  to  the undeformed state (before  rolling). Moreover, the presence of an additional { 110 } component was observed {{at the center of the}} (110) pole figure.   The pole density of three components increases withthe increasing degree of thickness reduction. By increasing degrees  of rolling from 81 % to 87 %, the value of orientation distribution function increases by a factor aboutthree times.   </div...|$|E
40|$|The {{appropriate}} exposure metrics for characterizing manganese (Mn) exposure {{associated with}} neurobehavioral effects {{have not been}} established. Blood levels of Mn (B-Mn) provide a potentially important intermediate marker of Mn airborne exposures. Using data from a study of a population of silicon- and <b>ferro-manganese</b> alloy production workers employed between 1973 and 1991, B-Mn levels were modeled in relation to prior Mn exposure using detailed work histories and estimated respirable Mn concentrations from air-sampling records. Despite wide variation in exposure levels estimated for individual jobs, duration of employment (exposure) was itself a strong predictor of B-Mn levels and strongest when an 80 -day half-life was applied to contributions over time (t= 6. 95, 7. 44, respectively; p< 10 (- 5)). Partitioning exposure concentrations based on process origin into two categories: (1) "large" respirable particulate (Mn-LRP) derived mainly from mechanically generated dust, and (2) "small" respirable particulate (Mn-SRP) primarily electric furnace condensation fume, revealed that B-Mn levels largely track the small, fume exposures. With a half-life of 65 days applied in a model with cumulative exposure terms for both Mn-LRP (t=- 0. 16, p= 0. 87) and Mn-SRP (t= 6. 45, p< 10 (- 5)), {{the contribution of the}} large-size fraction contribution was negligible. Constructing metrics based on the square root of SRP exposure concentrations produced a better model fit (t= 7. 87 vs. 7. 44, R(2) = 0. 2333 vs. 0. 2157). In a model containing both duration (t= 0. 79, p= 0. 43) and (square root) fume (t= 2. 47, p= 0. 01) metrics, the duration term was a weak contributor. Furnace-derived, small respirable Mn particulate appears to be the primary contributor to B-Mn levels, with a dose-rate dependence in a population chronically exposed to Mn, with air-concentrations declining in recent years. These observations may reflect the presence of homeostatic control of Mn levels in the blood and other body tissues and be useful in assessing Mn exposures for evaluating neurotoxic effects.

40|$|Trabalho completo: acesso restrito, p. 1207 – 1213 Manganese (Mn) is an {{essential}} element, but an effective toxic at high concentrations. While there is an extensive literature on occupational exposure, {{few studies have examined}} adults and children living near important sources of airborne Mn. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze hair Mn of children living in the vicinity of a <b>ferro-manganese</b> alloy production plant in the Great Salvador region, State of Bahia, Brazil and examine factors that influence this bioindicator of exposure. We examined 109 children in the age range of 1 – 10 years, living near the plant. Four separate housing areas were identified a priori on the bases of proximity to the emission sources and downwind location. A non-exposed group (n = 43) of similar socio-economic status was also evaluated. Mn hair (MnH) concentration was measured by graphite atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). Possible confounding hematological parameters were also assessed. Mean MnH concentration was 15. 20 μg/g (1. 10 – 95. 50 μg/g) for the exposed children and 1. 37 μg/g (0. 39 – 5. 58 μg/g) for the non-exposed. For the former, MnH concentrations were 7. 95 ± 1. 40 μg/g (farthest from the plant), 11. 81 ± 1. 11 μg/g (mid-region), 34. 43 ± 8. 66 μg/g (closest to the plant) and 34. 22 ± 9. 15 μg/g (directly downwind). Multiple regression analysis on log transformed MnH concentrations for the exposed children derived a model that explained 36. 8 % of the variability. In order of importance, area of children's residence, gender (girls > boys) and time of mother's residence in the area at the birth of the child, were significantly associated with MnH. Post hoc analyses indicated two groupings for exposure areas, with those living closest to and downwind of the plant displaying higher MnH concentrations compared to the others. The contribution of the time the mother lived in the community prior to the child's birth to the children's current MnH suggests that in utero exposure may play a role. A study of neurobehavioral performance with respect to Mn exposure in these children is currently underway...|$|E
