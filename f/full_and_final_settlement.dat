60|$|There {{have been}} many efforts made to settle it. Again and again it has been fondly hoped that it was settled; but every time it breaks out afresh, and more violently than ever. It was settled, our fathers hoped, by the Missouri Compromise, {{but it did not}} stay settled. Then the compromises of 1850 were {{declared}} to be a <b>full</b> <b>and</b> <b>final</b> <b>settlement</b> of the question. The two great parties, each in national convention, adopted resolutions declaring that the settlement made by the Compromise of 1850 was a finality that it would last forever. Yet how long before it was unsettled again? It broke out again in 1854, and blazed higher and raged more furiously than ever before, and the agitation has not rested since.|$|E

50|$|In the U.K. you can appoint an Arbiter {{or legal}} entity to {{negotiate}} with the creditors.

50|$|When a {{personal}} injury claim is settled either in court {{or out of}} court, the most common way the compensation payment is made is by a lump sum award in <b>full</b> <b>and</b> <b>final</b> <b>settlement</b> of the claim.

50|$|A {{compromise}} is an agreement whereby the parties settle a disputed obligation or some uncertainty between them. New obligations are created, and any existing obligations are extinguished. Compromise classically {{takes the form}} of an out-of-court settlement.

The general rule is that the old or former relationship falls away, and the new relationship is governed by the settlement agreement.|$|E

The trading parties would deliver the physical stock certificate and the payment to the clearing house, who would then ensure the certificate was handed over and the payment complete. This process is known as delivery versus payment.|$|R
