5|$|A {{speech of}} Andocides {{indirectly}} concerns epikleroi, as the orator {{claimed that the}} real origin of the dispute between <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> cousin Leagros was over which of them would claim an heiress that both were related to. Demosthenes' speech Against Macartatus includes a description of Sositheos' claiming of the epikleros Phulomakhe.|$|E
5|$|Bauer, Ester {{and their}} two-year-old son, Bengt, {{were on their}} way to their new home in Stockholm, where Bauer hoped for spiritual renewal and a new life for <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family.

5|$|Dunstan went to Rome in 960, and {{received}} the pallium from Pope John XII. On his journey there, Dunstan's acts of charity were so lavish as to leave nothing for <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> attendants. His steward complained, but Dunstan seems to have suggested that they trust in Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|During the Moscow 1925 chess tournament, Emanuel Lasker {{received}} a telegram informing {{him that the}} drama written by <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> brother Berthold, Vom Menschen die Geschichte ("History of Mankind"), had been accepted for performance at the Lessing theatre in Berlin. Emanuel Lasker was so distracted by this news that he lost badly to Carlos Torre the same day. The play, however, was not a success.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the highly}} {{successful}} releases of Gone With the Wind and Rebecca, Selznick began a three-year liquidation of Selznick International Pictures {{in order to}} draw profits for <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> outside investors. He developed and sold film projects to other producers and studios, and arranged loan outs of his contracted artists. Without outside backers he formed David O. Selznick Productions, Inc., which in 1941 became owner of one-fourth of United Artists.|$|E

5|$|Hergé's growing {{interest}} in art {{was reflected in the}} story, as he included a copy of Alfred Sisley's Le Canal du Loing at Marlinspike Hall. He also included paintings by Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró aboard Rastapopolous' Scheherazade. Muller's pseudonym in the story, Mull Pasha, was based upon the British soldier Glubb Pasha. In the final scene, Hergé included cameos of both <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> friend and colleague Edgar P. Jacobs.|$|E
5|$|In 608, general Heraclius the Elder, Exarch of Africa, revolted, urged on by Priscus, the Count of the Excubitors and {{son-in-law}} of Phocas.

5|$|In {{the romantic}} period, typified by Sylves (1927) and Volumes (1928), Rabearivelo's poems are shorter and reflect a purer form of {{traditional}} models. He identified <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> work as post-symbolist {{in the early}} part of his artistic career. Regarding Rabearivelo's works from this period, editor Jacques Rabemananjara acknowledged the poet's evident talent but critiqued his over-adherence to form and poetic conventions at the expense of innovation and genuine self-expression.|$|E

5|$|McCain's {{personal}} {{character has}} been a dominant feature of his public image. This image includes the military service of both <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family, the circumstances and tensions surrounding {{the end of his}} first marriage and beginning of second, his maverick political persona, his temper, his admitted problem of occasional ill-considered remarks, and his close ties to his children from both his marriages.|$|E
5|$|On November 10, 2005, Paulus van der Sloot won {{an unjust}} {{detention}} {{action against the}} Aruban government, clearing him as a suspect and allowing him to retain his government contract. The elder Van der Sloot then brought a second action, seeking monetary damages for <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family because of his false arrest. The action was initially successful, but the award of damages was reversed on appeal.|$|E
5|$|The high injury toll and {{congested}} schedule {{contributed to}} complaints about Joe Warbrick's behaviour. His {{comments to the}} English press – who directed much of their focus towards him – were viewed negatively by {{some members of the}} squad; he was accused of neglecting to acknowledge the contributions of players such as Thomas Ellison, Gage, Keogh, and Edward McCausland but to extol the efforts of <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> brothers.|$|E

5|$|The {{intervention}} was initially successful as Bolesław defeated Yaroslav's armies, and temporarily secured the throne for Sviatopolk. But when Bolesław withdrew <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> army from Kiev, Sviatopolk {{was unable to}} retain his position, being defeated by Yaroslav in the following year. Chronicles of the expedition include legendary accounts as well as factual history and {{have been subject to}} varied interpretations.|$|E
5|$|The same {{squad of}} players carried their {{promotion}} form into the 1955–56 {{season in the}} First Division, achieving the club's highest league finish of sixth place, and reaching the FA Cup final. They became attractive to the media; after the FA Cup semifinal victory, Boyd signed an exclusive contract committing <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> teammates to appearing only on BBC programmes in {{the weeks leading up}} to the final.|$|E
5|$|Ticinum {{eventually}} {{fell to the}} Lombards {{in either}} May or June 572.

5|$|After {{returning}} to Kathmandu, in complicity with Rana Bahadur, Bhimsen indulged in appropriating the palaces and properties of deposed members of Shah family, which he shared between <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> supporter Rangnath Paudel. This aroused resentment and jealousy among Sher Bahadur Shah (Rana Bahadur's step brother) and his faction, since {{they did not}} receive any portion of this confiscated property, despite their help in reinstating Rana Bahadur to power. They were also wary of Bhimsen's growing power. By this time, Rana Bahadur was a nominal figure and Kaji Bhimsen Thapa was single-handedly controlling the central administration of the country, being able to implement even unpopular reforms like Baisathi Haran.|$|E
5|$|Amenhotep I {{was the son}} of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari. His elder brothers, {{the crown}} prince Ahmose Sapair and Ahmose-ankh, died before him, thus {{clearing}} the way for his ascension to the throne. Amenhotep probably came to power while he was still young <b>himself,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> mother, Ahmose-Nefertari, appears to have been regent for him for at least a short time. The evidence for this regency is that both he and his mother are credited with founding a settlement for workers in the Theban Necropolis at Deir el-Medina. Amenhotep took his sister Ahmose-Meritamon as his Great Royal Wife. Another wife's name, Sitkamose, is attested on a nineteenth dynasty stele.|$|E
