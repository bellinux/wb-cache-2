5|$|The {{county seat}} of Washington County (before county {{government}} was abolished) {{is often referred}} to as West Kingston. In reality, West Kingston, a village of South <b>Kingstown,</b> does not have its own local government, but because the courthouse was located in West Kingston's zip code, it has become known as the county seat.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert Stuart {{was born}} on December 3, 1755 in Saunderstown, Rhode Island, a village of North <b>Kingstown,</b> and baptized at Old Narragansett Church on April 11, 1756.

5|$|Scotia left Troon, Scotland, on 2 November 1902. On her way southward {{she called}} at the Irish port of <b>Kingstown</b> (now Dún Laoghaire), at Funchal in Madeira, {{and then the}} Cape Verde Isles before an {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt was made to}} land at the tiny, isolated equatorial archipelago known as St Paul's Rocks. This attempt almost cost the life of the expedition's geologist and medical officer, James Harvie Pirie, who was fortunate to escape from the shark-infested seas after misjudging his leap ashore. Scotia reached Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands on 6 January 1903, where she re-provisioned for the Antarctic journey ahead.|$|E
5|$|The {{anniversary of}} the Restoration (which was also Charles's birthday)—29 May—was {{recognised}} in England until the mid-nineteenth century as Oak Apple Day, after the Royal Oak in which Charles hid during his escape from the forces of Oliver Cromwell. Traditional celebrations involved the wearing of oak leaves but these have now died out. Charles II is commemorated by statues in London's Soho Square, in Edinburgh's Parliament Square, in St Mary's Square in Gloucester, and near the south portal of Lichfield Cathedral, and is depicted extensively in literature and other media. Charleston, South Carolina, and South <b>Kingstown,</b> Rhode Island, are named after him.|$|E
5|$|Lody {{left his}} boarding-house hastily {{on the morning}} of 27 September and stayed {{overnight}} at the Roxburgh Hotel in Edinburgh. He left some of his luggage there, telling the manageress that he would be away for about eight days, and travelled the next day to Liverpool, where he took a room at the London and North Western Hotel on Lime Street. He bought a ticket to Ireland and took the SS Munster to Dublin via <b>Kingstown</b> (now Dún Laoghaire). It stopped at Holyhead in Anglesey, where an immigration official challenged Lody. His American travel documents proved sufficient to demonstrate his bona fides, and he proceeded on his way.|$|E
5|$|Synge {{was educated}} privately at schools in Dublin and Bray, and later studied piano, flute, violin, music theory and {{counterpoint}} at the Royal Irish Academy of Music. He travelled {{to the continent}} to study music, but {{changed his mind and}} decided to focus on literature. He was a talented student and won a scholarship in counterpoint in 1891. The family moved to the suburb of <b>Kingstown</b> (now Dún Laoghaire) in 1888, and Synge entered Trinity College, Dublin, the following year.

Between November 1889 and 1894 he took private music lessons with Robert Prescott Stewart.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} Church Hill, {{the route}} intersects MD 19A (South Main Street), which loops {{to the east}} of MD 213 to head into the town. Meanwhile, MD 213 bypasses Church Hill to the west, running through woodland, and intersects the western terminus of MD 300 (Sudlersville Road). The route heads back into farmland and intersects MD 19 (North Main Street), leaving the Church Hill area. MD 213 continues north through a mix of woods and farms. From here, the route turns northwest through more farmland before it passes some residences and businesses near the intersection with the western terminus of MD 544 (Mcginnis Road). Past the MD 544 intersection, the road continues through rural areas, but residences and businesses start to increase. MD 213 passes through <b>Kingstown</b> before crossing the Chester River on a drawbridge.|$|E

25|$|The rebels {{had failed}} to take either of Dublin's two main railway {{stations}} or either of its ports, at Dublin Port and <b>Kingstown.</b> As a result, during the following week, the British were able to bring in thousands of reinforcements from Britain and from their garrisons at the Curragh and Belfast. By {{the end of the}} week, British strength stood at over 16,000 men. Their firepower was provided by field artillery which they positioned on the northside of the city at Phibsborough and at Trinity College, and by the patrol vessel Helga, which sailed up the Liffey, having been summoned from the port at <b>Kingstown.</b> On Wednesday, 26 April, the guns at Trinity College and Helga shelled Liberty Hall, and the Trinity College guns then began firing at rebel positions, first at Boland's Mill and then in O'Connell Street.
