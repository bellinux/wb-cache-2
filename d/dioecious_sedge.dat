50|$|The {{site has}} local wetland areas {{strongly}} influenced by limestone characterised by marsh valerian (Valeriana dioica), butterwort (Pinguicula vulgaris), lesser club-moss (Selaginella selaginoides), grass-of-Parnassus (Parnassia palustris), <b>dioecious</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex dioica), few-flowered spike-rush (Eleocharis quinqueflora) and black bog-rush (Schoenus nigricans). Dry limestone flora {{are for the most}} part not found on the moors, with the exception of areas of mat-grass (Nardus stricta).|$|E
50|$|The wetland {{contains}} {{a collection of}} marshland plants. County rarities such as bog pimpernel are recorded, together with marsh lousewort, common cotton-grass, skull-cap, ragged-robin and southern marsh-orchid. Many sedges may be found. These include the only recorded Gloucestershire population of <b>dioecious</b> <b>sedge.</b> A particular feature of the marsh is tussock-sedge, with about forty different flowering plants living as epiphytes on the 2-3 ft high tussocks.|$|E
50|$|Ringdown is a {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest where outcrops of both Cretaceous Upper Greensand and underlying Triassic Keuper Marls occur. Amongst the vegetation present are two species {{which are very}} restricted in South West Britain, white beaksedge (Rhynchospora alba) and <b>dioecious</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex dioica). This site is the only known location for the latter in Somerset. A colony of the small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene) is found here.|$|E
50|$|The {{flowers of}} Carex {{are small and}} are {{combined}} into spikes, which are themselves combined into a larger inflorescence. The spike typically contains many flowers, but can hold as few as one in some species. Almost all Carex species are monoecious; each flower is either male (staminate) or female (pistillate). A few species are <b>dioecious.</b> <b>Sedges</b> exhibit diverse arrangements {{of male and female}} flowers. Often, the lower spikes are entirely pistillate and upper spikes staminate, with one or more spikes in between having pistillate flowers near the base and staminate flowers near the tip. In other species, all spikes are similar. In that case, they may have male flowers above and female flowers below (androgynous) or female flowers above and male flowers below (gynecandrous). In relatively few species, the arrangement of flowers is irregular.|$|R
50|$|In {{the flora}} on the reserve, 28 rare species were found and {{listed in the}} Red Book of Ukraine. There are several very rare species that {{are already in the}} Red Book of Ukraine, such as the <b>dioecious</b> <b>sedge,</b> and lapland willow. Among the plants that grow in the reserve, 2 species are in the European Red List, 1 species in Appendix 1 of the Bern Convention, and 28 species {{included}} in the list of regionally rare species.|$|E
50|$|The Achanalt {{reservoir}} and marshes {{were designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest on 18 May 1989 {{as the area}} is an important nesting ground. It is 214.6 ha. in size. The marshes are characterised by mesotrophic grassland on a river valley flood plain. There are two waterlogged Carex Juncus communities that include bottle sedge, marsh pennywort, and bogbean. In a relatively drier area, short grass and sedge occur, mainly in winter. The marshes are sedge dominated, and these include common sedge, carnation sedge, flea sedge, and star sedge. Tawny sedge and <b>dioecious</b> <b>sedge</b> occur in flush line areas. The featured herbs include heath spotted orchid and common valerian. Purple moor grass and tufted hair grass are locally extensive. Four nationally rare species of breeding birds are located here.|$|E
