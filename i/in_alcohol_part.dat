40|$|Radix Astragali is a {{component}} of several traditional medicines used {{for the treatment of}} type 2 diabetes in China. Radix Astragali is known to contain isoflavones, which inhibit α-glucosidase in the small intestines, and thus lowers the blood glucose levels. In this study, 21 samples obtained from different regions of China were extracted with ethyl acetate, then the IC 50 -values were determined, and the crude extracts were analyzed by 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. A principal component analysis of the 1 H-NMR spectra labeled with their IC 50 -values, that is, bioactivity-labeled 1 H-NMR spectra, showed a clear correlation between spectral profiles and the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. The loading plot and LC-HRMS/NMR of microfractions indicated that previously unknown long chain ferulates could be partly responsible for the observed antidiabetic activity of Radix Astragali. Subsequent preparative scale isolation revealed a compound not previously reported, linoleyl ferulate (1), showing α-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC 50 0. 5 mM) at a level comparable to the previously studied isoflavones. A closely related analogue, hexadecyl ferulate (2), did not show significant inhibitory activity, and the double bonds <b>in</b> the <b>alcohol</b> <b>part</b> of 1 seem to be important structural features for the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. This proof of concept study demonstrates that bioactivity-labeling of the 1 H-NMR spectral data of crude extracts allows global and nonselective identification of individual constituents contributing to the crude extract’s bioactivity...|$|R

These two factors are the amount of alcohol consumed by an individual's peers and the individual's motivation to engage in self-presentation. I present a theoretical model of college students' alcohol consumption that incorporates these variables, among others, and I present results of two studies investigating the relationships among these variables. I investigated whether individuals consume <b>alcohol,</b> <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> for self-presentational purposes.

40|$|Background: Reductions in {{drinking}} among individuals randomised to control groups <b>in</b> brief <b>alcohol</b> intervention trials are common {{and suggest that}} asking study participants about their drinking may itself cause them to reduce their consumption. We sought {{to test the hypothesis}} that the statistical artefact regression to the mean (RTM) explains part of the reduction in such studies. Methods: 967 participants in a cohort study of <b>alcohol</b> consumption <b>in</b> New Zealand provided data at baseline and again six months later. We use graphical methods and apply thresholds of 8, 12, 16 and 20 in AUDIT scores to explore RTM. Results: There was a negative association between baseline AUDIT scores and change in AUDIT scores from baseline to six months, which in the absence of bias and confounding, is RTM. Students with lower baseline scores tended to have higher follow-up scores and conversely, those with higher baseline scores tended to have lower follow-up scores. When a threshold score of 8 was used to select a subgroup, the observed mean change was approximately half of that observed without a threshold. The application of higher thresholds produced greater apparent reductions <b>in</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption. Conclusions: <b>Part</b> of the reduction seen in the control groups of brief alcohol intervention trials is likely to be due to RTM and the amount of change is likely to be greater as the threshold for entry to the trial increases. Quantification of RTM warrants further study and should assist understanding assessment and other research participation effects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Alcohol abuse {{has long}} been known to {{adversely}} affect innate and adaptive immune responses and pre-dispose to infections. One cellular mechanism responsible for this effect is alcohol-induced suppression of TNF-α (TNF) by mononuclear phagocytes. We have previously shown that <b>alcohol</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> inhibits TNF-α processing by TNF converting enzyme (TACE) in human monocytes. We hypothesized that the chain length of the alcohol is critical for post-transcriptional suppression of TNF secretion. Methods Due to the complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of TNF in macrophages, to specifically study TNF processing at the cell membrane we performed transient transfections of A 549 cells with the TNF cDNA driven by the heterologous CMV promoter. TNF/TACE interactions at the cell surface were assessed using fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy. Results The single carbon alcohol, methanol suppressed neither TNF secretion nor FRET efficiency between TNF and TACE. However, 2, 3, and 4 carbon alcohols were potent suppressors of TNF processing and FRET efficiency. The effect of ethanol, a 2 -carbon alcohol was reversible. Conclusion These data show that inhibition of TNF-α processing by acute ethanol is a direct affect of ethanol on the cell membrane and is reversible upon cessation or metabolism. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Reduced {{metabolic}} {{activity in}} frontal brain regions, and reduced striatal dopamine receptor densities {{have been shown}} <b>in</b> <b>alcohol</b> dependent patients. Little is known on functional changes in the fronto-striatal-thalamic dopaminergic neurocircuitry in these patients.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES: Male alcohol dependent patients (N= 40) and healthy controls (N= 39) performed an AX-continuous performance test before and after administration of the DA agonist apomorphine (0. 005 mg/kg). RESULTS: At baseline alcohol dependent patients were slower and less accurate compared to healthy controls. After administration of apomorphine, performance improved <b>in</b> <b>alcohol</b> dependent patients and deteriorated in healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced cognitive performance <b>in</b> <b>alcohol</b> dependent patients compared with healthy controls may indicate dopamine dysfunctioning at the prefrontal level. Improvement of cognitive performance <b>in</b> <b>alcohol</b> dependent patients after administration of apomorphine and deterioration in healthy controls provides evidence for an inverted U-shape relation between dopaminergic functioning and cognitive performance...|$|R

Additionally, we searched recent handbooks on neuromodulation and/or addiction. Results: Studies investigating these neuromodulation techniques <b>in</b> <b>alcohol</b> addiction remain to date rather limited and especially tDCS and rTMS applications have been investigated. Overall, the clinical effects seem modest. The use of VNS and ECT has yet to be investigated <b>in</b> <b>alcohol</b> dependent patients.

40|$|In {{the course}} of the {{procedure}} to determine nucleic acids in the polyhedral bodies, or the inclusion bodies of virus particles, of silkworms, it was observed that the major part of the bodies treated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) immediately dissolved <b>in</b> <b>alcohol.</b> The material dissolved <b>in</b> <b>alcohol</b> was proved to be protein in the previous paper. By the presence of TCA, the polyhedral protein dissolves in acetone and <b>in</b> methyl <b>alcohol</b> as well as <b>in</b> ethyl <b>alcohol,</b> but does not dissolve in water, ether, and benzene. This phenomenon {{can be attributed to the}} specialities of both the protein and the acid. Only the polyhedral protein dissolved <b>in</b> <b>alcohol</b> containing TCA, and no protein having such a property was observed (Table 2). The dissolution of the protein <b>in</b> <b>alcohol</b> is caused by a minute amount of some special acids (Table 3). TCA has the strongest effect. The acids which have stronger effect are generally stronger acids, and hydrogen ion is an indispensable factor to dissolve the protein <b>in</b> <b>alcohol</b> (Table 4). However, the effectiveness of acids has no direct relationship to their dissociation constants, and the kind of anions seems to be more important. It is very interesting to note that the two most effective acids, TCA and perchloric acid, are similar to each other in their structures on the electronic aspects. They have likewise three polar radicals around an atom. A linear relationship is observed between the concentration of TCA and the solubility of the polyhedral protein (Fig. 1). The protein dissolves <b>in</b> <b>alcohol</b> by 1 g. of its nitrogen per 0. 01 mole of TCA. The polyhedral protein treated with TCA became insoluble <b>in</b> <b>alcohol</b> by dialysis against distilled water in the refrigerator. But the dialysed protein dissolved <b>in</b> <b>alcohol</b> by a new addition of TCA. From the freshly prepared alcoholic solution which was saturated with the protein upon the definite amount of TCA, the latter was rapidly removed away and gel-formation was brought about by dialysis against <b>alcohol</b> <b>in</b> the refrigerator (Table 5). A hypothesis to explain these phenomena was proposed. 多角体蛋白は微量の特殊な酸を含有する無水アルコールに溶解する. この現象は蛋白質及び酸の特異性に帰せられる. エタノールの外メタノ一ル, アセトンが溶媒として有効である. 有効な酸はある程度以上の強酸であるが,一般に酸の強さと該効果の間には一定の関係は認められない. この酸効果はトリクロール醋酸(TCA) が最も強い.
