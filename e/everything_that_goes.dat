25|$|The 'Man on the throne' in {{the vision}} of Ezekiel descriptively {{represents}} God, who is controlling <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> on in the world, and how all of the archetypes He set up should interact. The 'Man on the throne', however, drives when the four angels connect their wings. This means that God will not be revealed to us by us looking at all four elements (for instance) as separate and independent entities. However, when {{one looks at the}} way that earth, wind, fire and water (for instance) which all oppose each other are able to work together and coexist in complete harmony in the world, this shows that there is really a higher power (God) telling these elements how to act.|$|E

Moore {{was confident}} that Carnivàle {{was one of the}} most complicated shows on television, while show creator Daniel Knauf admitted that [...] "you may not understand <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> on but it does make a certain sense." [...] In stating that Carnivàle was meant to be a demanding show with a lot of subtext, Knauf refrained from giving explicit clues. He did not wish his intent as an author to supersede the viewer's interpretation.|$|E

500|$|Knight Ridder {{music critic}} Howard Cohen gave the album {{four out of}} four stars lauding Fernández's vocals and Estefan Jr.'s production. Ramiro Burr's review for the San Antonio Express-News praised the [...] "blend of pop balladry with ranchera rhythms and {{traditional}} instruments that elevates this CD". He felt that Fernández [...] "conveys a wealth of emotion in his songs" [...] and called [...] "En El Jardín" [...] a [...] "glorious ballad". Eliseo Cardona of El Nuevo Herald lauded Santander's compositions and called Fernández a [...] "first-rate interpreter {{who knows how to}} give a poetic edge to <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> through his throat".|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the sound}} effects in Barton Fink are laden with meaning. For example, Barton is summoned by a bell while dining in New York; its sound is light and pleasant. By contrast, the eerie {{sustained}} bell of the Hotel Earle rings endlessly through the lobby, until Chet silences it. The nearby rooms of the hotel emit a constant chorus of guttural cries, moans, and assorted unidentifiable noises. These sounds coincide with Barton's confused mental state and punctuate Charlie's claim that [...] "I hear <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> on in this dump". The applause in the first scene foreshadows the tension of Barton's move west, mixed {{as it is with}} the sound of an ocean wave crashing– an image which is shown onscreen soon thereafter.|$|E

500|$|Charlie's {{understanding}} of the world is depicted as omniscient, as when he asks Barton about [...] "the two lovebirds next door", {{despite the fact that they}} are several doors away. When Barton asks how he knows about them, Charlie responds: [...] "Seems like I hear <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'." [...] His total awareness of the events at the Earle demonstrate the kind of understanding needed to show real empathy, as described by Audrey. This theme returns when Charlie explains in his final scene: [...] "Most guys I just feel sorry for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to think about what they're going through. How trapped they are. I understand it. I feel for 'em. So I try to help them out." ...|$|E
500|$|Through 1897, McKinley {{maintained}} neutrality on Cuba, {{hoping to}} negotiate autonomy for the island. [...] Nevertheless, pro-war elements, prominently including the Hearst newspapers, pressured McKinley {{for a more}} aggressive foreign policy. [...] On May 20, 1897, the Senate passed a resolution favoring intervention in Cuba, 41–14, with Hanna in the minority. [...] As the crisis slowly built through late 1897 and early 1898, Hanna became concerned about the political damage if McKinley, against popular opinion, kept the nation out of war. [...] "Look out for Mr. Bryan. [...] <b>Everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> wrong {{will be in the}} Democratic platform in 1900. [...] You can be damn sure of that!" [...] Nevertheless, the Ohio senator believed that McKinley's policy of quietly pressing Spain for colonial reform in Cuba had already yielded results without war, and would continue to do so.|$|E

Overmars relished the challenge of playing in England: [...] "I like English football because there is more pace. With my speed and quality I think it will be good for me here." [...] Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger believed Overmars had his [...] "best years ahead of him" [...] and met his criteria of a player [...] "used to the pressures of playing for a big club and <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> with it". He opined that Arsenal lost the Premier League at home the previous season – [...] "we were maybe the best away team," [...] and commented on their inability to play expansive football. Wenger felt the signing of Overmars would rectify that problem.|$|E

500|$|Other {{than through}} the characters, the show's good-and-evil theme manifests in the series' {{contemporary}} religion, the Christian military order Knights Templar, tarot divination, and in historical {{events like the}} Dust Bowl and humankind's first nuclear test. The writers had established a groundwork for story arcs, character biographies and genealogical character links before filming of the seasons began, {{but many of the}} intended clues remained unnoticed by viewers. While Ronald D. Moore was confident that Carnivàle {{was one of the most}} complicated shows on television, Daniel Knauf reassured critics that Carnivàle was intended to be a demanding show with a lot of subtext and admitted that [...] "you may not understand <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> on but it does make a certain sense". Knauf provided hints about the show's mythological structure to online fandom both during and after the two-season run of Carnivàle, and left fans a production summary of Carnivàle first season two years after cancellation.|$|E

If I do get back in, I don't want to be a coach... I want to be a manager, but that's easier said than done... I {{want to be able to}} pick the team, make the decisions and <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> with it. That said, I can't do anything without my badges", he told the Liverpool Echo.|$|E

2500|$|The show covers {{multiple}} themes: growing up, {{parents and}} children, accepting responsibility, morality, and finally, wish fulfillment and its consequences. The Time Magazine reviewers {{wrote that the}} play's [...] "basic insight... is at heart, most fairy tales are about the loving yet embattled relationship between parents and children. Almost <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> wrong which is to say, almost everything that can arises from a failure of parental or filial duty, despite the best intentions." [...] Stephen Holden wrote that the themes of the show include parent-child relationships and the individual's responsibility to the community. The witch isn't just a scowling old hag, but a key symbol of moral ambivalence. James Lapine said that the most unpleasant person (the Witch) would have the truest things to say and the [...] "nicer" [...] people would be less honest.

2500|$|Hofstadter, {{influenced}} by his wife, {{was a member}} of the Young Communist League in college, and in April 1938 he joined the Communist Party of the USA; he quit in 1939. [...] Hofstadter had been reluctant to join, knowing the orthodoxy it imposed on intellectuals, and disillusioned by the spectacle of the Moscow Show Trials, but wrote: [...] "I join without enthusiasm but with a sense of obligation...my fundamental reason for joining is that I don't like capitalism and want to get rid of it." [...] He remained anti-capitalist, writing: [...] "I hate capitalism and <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> with it", but was similarly disillusioned with Stalinism, finding the Soviet Union [...] "essentially undemocratic" [...] and the Communist Party rigid and doctrinaire. In the 1940s Hofstadter abandoned political causes, feeling that intellectuals were no more likely to [...] "find a comfortable home" [...] under socialism than they were under capitalism.|$|E

More than 100,000 copies of O.C.M.S. were sold, behind a [...] "rigorous tour schedule and a memorable live show"; what CMT regarded as [...] "an impressive number for a new band that didn't know much about record deals and <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> with it." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the {{leadership}} election, Nick Clegg registered a formal complaint about Huhne's conduct to Chris Rennard, the party's Chief Whip and returning officer. Clegg stated that his rival was indulging in: [...] "the politics of innuendo, mounting false challenges {{and running a}} campaign that is handing political ammunition to the party's political opponents." [...] Huhne and Clegg were debating on live television on BBC's The Politics Show on Sunday 18 November 2007, when presenter Jon Sopel produced a briefing document that had been specially delivered to the show's production team by the Huhne campaign team on the preceding Friday. The document excoriated Clegg {{on a number of}} policy and political issues and was titled [...] "Calamity Clegg". When challenged about the document, Huhne claimed that he had no knowledge of it and said he did not agree with the document title but agreed with the points within it. Asked how it was possible that he had no knowledge of such a major document sent to the producer of the show he was due to appear on, Huhne replied: [...] "It's quite impossible to check <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> out of the office... But I can assure you that's not had my authorization." [...] After Clegg complained about what he called [...] "dirty tricks" [...] and other senior party members condemned the Huhne campaign attack, Huhne's campaign manager Anna Werrin claimed that the title of the memo was just the product of an [...] "over-zealous researcher" [...] and had not been seen or approved by Huhne or any senior campaign officials prior to release. [...] "The document title had not been approved before the document was sent out and neither Chris nor I were aware of it." ...|$|E
