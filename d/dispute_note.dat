40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{definitions}} of language {{is that it is a}} means of communication. The present research is, however, interested in quite a different aspect of language use, hence the title: Language as a Means of Excommunication. The term 'excommunication', strictly meaning to "exclude from a church or a religious community"(Note 1), is also used to mean "oust or exclude from a group or membership by decree" (Note 2). This paper deals with the use of language to 'excommunicate' 'others', whether literally or metaphorically, from the membership of a particular group, regardless of its secular or religious nature. The act of excommunication in its broad sense denotes "exclusion from fellowship" (Note 3) (Merriam-Webster, 2002) (Note 4). The researcher focuses on informal acts of 'excommunication' practiced by language users who are not authorized to do so in any way. The research is thus an exploration in contemporary Egyptian discourse with an eye on the use of language to oust 'others' as such. Two events have been selected for that purpose: a basically religious one (Note 5) and an originally sports event that has almost turned into a national <b>dispute</b> (<b>Note</b> 6). The paper shall mainly deal with two linguistic tools used for the disqualification of others as members of a given group; the use of particular lexemes that imply rather than state that the 'other' is some sort of 'infidel' or 'traitor', and the resort to direct quotations from and allusions to decontextualized religious texts that would virtually entail the condemnation of the 'other' as an outcast...|$|E

5000|$|Before Witness K {{revealed}} ASIS's clandestine activities, {{the resulting}} treaty between East Timor and Australia was ridiculed. Over 50 {{members of the}} US Congress {{sent a letter to}} Prime Minister John Howard calling for a [...] "fair" [...] and [...] "equitable" [...] resolution of the border <b>dispute,</b> <b>noting</b> East Timor's poverty.

50|$|Some in the United States {{have claimed}} that the Assize of Arms is an ancient right to bear arms, though this claim is <b>disputed,</b> <b>noting</b> that the Assize of Arms was an obligation, not a right (i.e., a choice). The Supreme Court of the United States ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller {{regarding}} {{the right to bear}} arms referred only to the English Bill of Rights of 1689 as precedent.|$|R
50|$|Only homes {{owned by}} Hare Krishnas were {{targeted}} for demolition, though the Hare Krishnas claimed that other homeowners faced similar legal circumstances. The government characterized {{the issue as}} a legal <b>dispute,</b> <b>noting</b> a series of court rulings that the land should revert to the Karasai regional government, because the farmer from whom Hare Krishna followers had purchased the land in 1999 did not hold title, and thus the land had not been properly privatized.|$|R

The Court invoked the disproportionality test in adjudicating the <b>dispute,</b> <b>noting</b> that the ICJ, [...] "as its jurisprudence has indicated, it may on occasion decide not {{to take account of}} very small islands or decide not to give them their full potential entitlement to maritime zones, should such an approach have a disproportionate effect on the delimitation line under consideration" [...] and owing to a previous agreement between Ukraine and Romania, the island [...] "should have no effect on the delimitation in this case, other than that stemming from the role of the 12-nautical-mile arc of its territorial sea" [...] previously agreed between the parties.|$|R

The Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) of Nur Misuari declared {{its support for}} China against the Philippines in the South China Sea dispute, calling both China and the Moro people as victims of Philippine colonialism, and noting China's history of friendly relation with the Sultanate of Sulu in the region. The MNLF also denounced America's assistance to the Philippines in their colonization of the Moro people in addition to denouncing the Philippines claims to the islands disputed with China, and denouncing America for siding with the Philippines in the <b>dispute,</b> <b>noting</b> that the Moros and China maintained peaceful relations, while {{on the other hand}} the Moros had to resist other colonial powers, having to fight the Spanish, fight the Americans, and fight the Japanese, in addition to fighting the Philippines.|$|R
5000|$|The {{historian}} William Knox {{has argued}} that, like other early female MPs in the UK, [...] "she literally inherited" [...] her seat from her husband, but Kenneth Baxter <b>disputes</b> this, <b>noting</b> {{that her husband}} had stood down from the former West Perthshire seat in 1917 when he succeeded to the duchy and that it had been won by a Liberal candidate in 1918 and 1922.|$|R
500|$|In Silcott's case, {{according}} to the scientist who conducted the ESDA test, Robert Radley, the notes from {{the section of the}} fifth interview in which Silcott appeared to incriminate himself had been inserted after the other notes were written. The seventh and final page of the fifth interview, where the participants would normally sign, was missing. The ESDA test suggested that, on the third to sixth pages of the interview, no impressions had been left from previous pages, although these earlier impressions appeared {{throughout the rest of the}} notes. According to Will Bennett in The Independent, the test [...] "also revealed an imprint of a different page five from the one submitted in evidence which was clearly the same interview with Silcott but in which he made no implicit admissions." [...] In addition to this, David Baxendale, a Home Office forensic scientist who was asked to investigate by Essex police, said that the paper on which the <b>disputed</b> <b>notes</b> were written came from a different batch of paper from the rest of the interview.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about his early life.

However more recent Polish studies <b>dispute</b> this, <b>noting</b> that the rotmistrz, known in some sources only by his surname Krzeczowski and in others as Mikołaj Krzyczewski, was probably another person.|$|R

5|$|Some Schubert {{performers}} tend to {{play the}} entire trilogy of the last sonatas in a single recital, thereby stressing their interrelatedness, and suggesting that they form a single, complete cycle. However, since each of these sonatas is rather long (as compared, for instance, with most of Mozart's or Beethoven's sonatas), such a program may prove exhausting to some listeners. One of the solutions to this problem is to shorten the program by omitting repeats, mainly those of the opening movements' expositions (however, this practice is highly <b>disputed,</b> as <b>noted</b> above). The pioneers of the Schubert sonata performance, Schnabel and Erdmann, {{are known to have}} played the entire trilogy in one evening; more recently, so did Alfred Brendel, Maurizio Pollini, Mitsuko Uchida, and Paul Lewis.|$|R
