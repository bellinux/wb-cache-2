50|$|Three {{studies have}} been carried out into Acute Heart Failure (AHF).

Conversely, in the same year, also in the US, Horwich et al. analysed 81,810 AHF admissions at 241 sites. Weekend AHF admission compared to weekday admission was associated with an increased in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.13; 95% CI 1.02-1.27). In a smaller Japanese study (of 1620 patients) in 2014, Hamaguchi et al., found <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death</b> was comparable between patients admitted on the weekend and weekdays (OR = 1.13; 95% CI 1.63-2.00; p=0.69).|$|E

40|$|IntroductionNew York City {{has one of}} {{the highest}} {{reported}} death rates from coronary heart disease in the United States. We sought to measure the accuracy of this rate by examining death certificates. MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional validation study by using a random sample of death certificates that recorded <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths</b> in New York City from January through June 2003, stratified by neighborhoods with low, medium, and high coronary heart disease death rates. We abstracted data from hospital records, and an independent, blinded medical team reviewed these data to validate cause of death. We computed a comparability ratio (coronary heart disease deaths recorded on death certificates divided by validated coronary heart disease deaths) to quantify agreement between death certificate determination and clinical judgment. ResultsOf 491 sampled <b>death</b> certificates for <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths,</b> medical charts were abstracted and reviewed by the expert panel for 444 (90 %). The comparability ratio for coronary heart disease deaths among decedents aged 35 to 74 years was 1. 51, indicating that death certificates overestimated coronary heart disease deaths in this age group by 51 %. The comparability ratio increased with age to 1. 94 for decedents aged 75 to 84 years and to 2. 37 for decedents aged 85 years or older.

Methods and Results-—Outcomes of 361 consecutive patients (mean age, 59. 115. 4 years) who had undergone surgery for IE in 8 European centers of cardiac surgery were recorded prospectively, and a risk factor analysis (multivariable logistic regression) for <b>in-hospital</b> <b>death</b> was performed. The discriminatory power of a new predictive scoring system was assessed with the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Score validation procedures were carried out. Fifty-six (15. 5 %) patients died postsurgery.

Method: We retrospectively analyzed data fromenrolled patients with ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation who presented within 24 h of onset. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography to evaluate diastolic filling pressure estimated as the ratio of early transmitral flow velocity (E) to mitral annular velocity (e') within 24 h of admission. Weevaluated initial ischemic lesion volume andNational Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. Results: Two hundred and sixty-six patients were enrolled.

40|$|Abstract Background Mortality is {{a widely}} used, but often criticised, quality {{indicator}} for hospitals. In many countries, mortality is calculated from <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths,</b> due to limited access to follow-up data on patients transferred between hospitals and on discharged patients. The objectives were to: i) summarize time, place and {{cause of death for}} first time acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke and hip fracture, ii) compare case-mix adjusted 30 -day mortality measures based on <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths</b> and in-and-out-of hospital deaths, with and without patients transferred to other hospitals. Methods Norwegian hospital data within a 5 -year period were merged with information from official registers. Mortality based on in-and-out-of-hospital deaths, weighted according to length of stay at each hospital for transferred patients (W 30 D), was compared to a) mortality based on in-and-out-of-hospital deaths excluding patients treated at two or more hospitals (S 30 D), and b) mortality based on <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths</b> (IH 30 D). Adjusted mortalities were estimated by logistic regression which, in addition to hospital, included age, sex and stage of disease. The hospitals were assigned outlier status according to the Z-values for hospitals in the models; low mortality: Z-values below the 5 -percentile, high mortality: Z-values above the 95 -percentile, medium mortality: remaining hospitals. Results The data included 48 048 AMI patients, 47 854 stroke patients and 40 142 hip fracture patients from 55, 59 and 58 hospitals, respectively. The overall relative frequencies of deaths within 30 days were 19. 1 % (AMI), 17. 6 % (stroke) and 7. 8 % (hip fracture). The cause of death diagnoses included the referral diagnosis for 73. 8 - 89. 6 % of the deaths within 30 days. When comparing S 30 D versus W 30 D outlier status changed for 14. 6 % (AMI), 15. 3 % (stroke) and 36. 2 % (hip fracture) of the hospitals. For IH 30 D compared to W 30 D outlier status changed for 18. 2 % (AMI), 25. 4 % (stroke) and 27. 6 % (hip fracture) of the hospitals. Conclusions Mortality measures based on <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths</b> alone, or measures excluding admissions for transferred patients, can be misleading as indicators of hospital performance. We propose to attribute the outcome to all hospitals by fraction of time spent in each hospital for patients transferred between hospitals to reduce bias due to double counting or exclusion of hospital stays. </p...|$|R

Methods: The database includes all patients who were hospitalized in New York State during the years 1990 to 1995. Using standard logistic regression techniques, we analyzed the relationship between hospital volume and outcome. Results: No correlation exists between hospital volume and <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths</b> in coronary artery bypass grafting. Statewide, 31 hospitals performed 97, 137 operations over the 6 -year period (overall mortality rate, 2. 75 %). By contrast, most of the hospitals statewide (195 of 230 hospitals) performed 9847 elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs with an overall mortality rate of 5. 5 %. In abdominal aortic aneurysm operations, a significant inverse relationship between hospital volume and <b>in-hospital</b> <b>deaths</b> was determined. Sixteen hospitals performed 7199 repairs for congenital cardiac defects. A significant inverse relationship (which was most pronounced for neonates) was found between volume and death. Conclusions: The importance of these findings lies in the rather striking difference between the volume-outcome relationship found for operations for abdominal aortic aneurysms and congenital cardiac defects and the lack of such a relationship for coronary artery bypass grafting. This observation may be largely explained by the quality improvement program in New York State for bypass operations since 1989. If so, these results have important implications for expanding the scope of quality improvement efforts in New York State. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1999; 117 : 419 - 30...|$|R
