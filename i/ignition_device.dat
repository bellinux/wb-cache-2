60|$|Emil Gluck, having {{disposed}} of his immediate enemies, now sought a wider field, though his enmity for newspaper men {{and for the}} police remained always active. The royalties on his <b>ignition</b> <b>device</b> for gasolene-engines had mounted up while he lay in prison, and year by year the earning power of his invention increased. He was independent, able to travel wherever he willed over the earth and to glut his monstrous appetite for revenge. He had become a monomaniac and an anarchist--not a philosophic anarchist, merely, but a violent anarchist. Perhaps the word is misused, and he is better described as a nihilist, or an annihilist. It is known that he affiliated {{with none of the}} groups of terrorists. He operated wholly alone, but he created a thousandfold more terror and achieved a thousandfold more destruction than all the terrorist groups added together.|$|E

60|$|Persecuted, maligned, and misunderstood, the forlorn {{and lonely}} man {{made no attempt}} at retaliation. All his life he had been sinned against, and all his life he had sinned against no one. But his cup of {{bitterness}} was not yet full to overflowing. Having lost his position, and being without any income, {{he had to find}} work. His first place was at the Union Iron Works, in San Francisco, where he proved a most able draughtsman. It was here that he obtained his firsthand knowledge of battleships and their construction. But the reporters discovered him and featured him in his new vocation. He immediately resigned and found another place; but after the reporters had driven him away from half-a-dozen positions, he steeled himself to brazen out the newspaper persecution. This occurred when he started his electroplating establishment--in Oakland, on Telegraph Avenue. It was a small shop, employing three men and two boys. Gluck himself worked long hours. Night after night, as Policeman Carew testified on the stand, he did not leave the shop till one and two in the morning. It was during this period that he perfected the improved <b>ignition</b> <b>device</b> for gas- engines, the royalties from which ultimately made him wealthy.|$|E

50|$|Forty {{scientists}} from Sandia, led by Richard Schwoebel, began an independent technical {{inquiry into the}} explosion on 7 December 1989.

50|$|An outside flame ignitor was {{an early}} <b>ignition</b> <b>device</b> used in internal-combustion engines that used a flame outside the engine and a sliding port on the {{cylinder}} head. At the appropriate time in the compression cycle of the engine, the port would briefly be opened and closed allowing the fuel/air mixture in the cylinder to be ignited by the flame. They had many problems, including partial loss of compression through the port when it opened and many mechanical problems with the mechanism that operated the port. They were considered obsolete before 1911.|$|E

Hotshot crews can engage in all phases of wildfire response, from initial attack to mop-up. They are also trained in specialized operations, such as hot spotting, spot fire attack, tree felling, and structure protection.|$|R

50|$|An <b>ignition</b> {{interlock}} <b>device</b> or breath alcohol <b>ignition</b> interlock <b>device</b> (IID and BAIID) is a breathalyzer for an individual's vehicle. It {{requires the}} driver to blow into a mouthpiece on the device before starting the vehicle. If the resultant breath-alcohol concentration analyzed result {{is greater than the}} programmed blood alcohol concentration (which varies between countries), the device prevents the engine from being started. The interlock device is located inside the vehicle, near the driver’s seat, and is directly connected to the engine’s ignition system.|$|R
50|$|The higher {{heating value}} is {{experimentally}} determined in a bomb calorimeter. The combustion of a stoichiometric mixture of fuel and oxidizer (e.g. two moles of hydrogen and one mole of oxygen) in a steel container at 25 C is initiated by an <b>ignition</b> <b>device</b> and the reactions allowed to complete. When hydrogen and oxygen react during combustion, water vapor is produced. The vessel and its contents are then cooled to the original 25 °C and the {{higher heating value}} is determined as the heat released between identical initial and final temperatures.|$|E
5000|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines for remote control models have typically been two stroke engines {{that run on}} specially blended fuel. Engine sizes are typically given in cm³ or cubic inches, ranging from tiny engines like these [...]02 in³ to huge 1.60 in³ or larger. For even larger sizes, many modelers turn to four stroke or gasoline engines (see below.) Glow plug engines have an <b>ignition</b> <b>device</b> that possesses a platinum wire coil in the glow plug, that catalytically glows {{in the presence of}} the methanol in glow engine fuel, providing the combustion source.|$|E
50|$|First, fuel {{is brought}} to the heater using piping from a fuel tank, or taps into the vehicle’s fuel system. A fan blows air into a {{combustion}} chamber, and a spark plug or <b>ignition</b> <b>device</b> lights the gasoline/air mixture. A built-in safety switch prevents fuel from flowing unless the fan is working. Outside the combustion chamber, a second, larger diameter tube conducts air around the combustion tube's outer surface, and a second fan blows the warmed air into tubing to direct it towards {{the interior of the}} vehicle. Most gasoline heaters produce between 5,000 and 50,000 BTU per hour.|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) {{vehicles}} using {{a traditional}} ICE {{that has been}} modified to use hydrogen fuel are an important mid-term technology {{on the path to}} the hydrogen economy. Hydrogen-powered ICEs that can run on pure hydrogen or a blend of hydrogen and compressed natural gas (CNG) are a way of addressing the widespread lack of hydrogen fuelling infrastructure in the near term. Hydrogen-powered ICEs have operating advantages as all weather conditions performances, no warm-up, no cold-start issues and being more fuel efficient than conventional spark-ignition engines.
