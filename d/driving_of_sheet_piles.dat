40|$|Vibratory {{driving is}} today {{the most common}} {{installation}} method of sheet piles. The knowledge of the induced ground vibrations is however still deficient. This makes predictions of the vibration magnitudes difficult to carry out with good reliability. To avoid exceeding the limit values, resulting in stops of production, or that vibratory driven sheet piles are discarded for more costly solutions, a need for increased knowledge of the vibration process is imminent. With increased knowledge, a more reliable and practical prediction model can be developed.   The aim of this thesis is to analyze measured data from a field study to increase {{the understanding of the}} induced vibrations and their propagation through the soil. The field study was performed in Karlstad in May 2010, where a trial sheet piling prior to an extension of Karlstad Theatre was carried out. During the trial sheet piling, two triaxial geophones were mounted at the ground surface at two different distances from the sheet piles, to measure the vibration amplitude. The field test is associated with some limitations. Only four sheet piles were driven, with one measurement per sheet pile. Some measurements were less successful and some parameters had to be assumed. This limits the accuracy but still provides some interesting results. Another aim is to compare the measured values to existing models for predicting vibrations from piling and sheet piling operations. There are today several prediction models available, which however often provide too crude estimations or alternatively are too advanced to be incorporated in practical use. Two basic empirical prediction models are compared to the measured values in Karlstad, where the first is one of the earliest and most well known models and the other is a later development of the first model. The purpose of this comparison is to evaluate these models to {{contribute to the development of}} a new prediction model. The results show that the earlier model greatly overestimates the vibration magnitude while the later developed model provides a better estimation.   A literature study is performed to gain a theoretical background to the problem of ground vibrations and how they are related to the method of vibratory <b>driving</b> <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>piles.</b> The analysis considering the field study and prediction models is mainly performed by using MATLAB to obtain different graphical presentations of the vibration signals. The conclusions that can be drawn from the results are that the focus of vibration analysis should not always be the vertical vibration components. Horizontal movements of the sheet pile might be introduced, e. g. by the configuration of the clamping device, which generates additional vibrations in horizontal directions. The soil characteristics influence the magnitude of the vibrations. As the sheet pile reaches a stiffer soil layer, the vibration magnitude increases. A realistic and reliable prediction model should take the characteristics of the soil into account...|$|E

40|$|Urban {{construction}} sites require strict {{control of their}} environmental impact, which, for vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> driving, can include damage to nearby structures due to ground vibrations. However, the lack of knowledge concerning the generation of soil vibrations makes the prediction of ground vibration levels difficult. This MSc. thesis in particular, focuses on a crucial link in the vibration transfer chain: the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil interface, which {{is also one of}} the least documented. The aim of this thesis is first, to carry out a full-scale field test consisting in the monitoring <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> and ground vibrations during <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibratory driving. And second, to analyze a selected portion of the collected data with focus on the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil vibration transfer. Both aspects of the thesis work aim, more generally, to contribute to the understanding of ground vibration generation under vibratory <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> driving. The full-scale field study was performed in Solna in May 2013. It consisted in the vibratory <b>driving</b> <b>of</b> seven <b>sheet</b> <b>piles,</b> out <b>of</b> which three were fitted with accelerometers. During the driving, ground vibrations were measured by accelerometers, the closest ones placed only 0. 5 m from the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> line. The design and installation of the soil instrumentation was innovative in as much as accelerometers were not only set on the ground surface but also at three different depths (~ 3 m, 5 m and 6 m). The analysis presented in this thesis is primarily a comparison between <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibrations and ground vibrations measured 0. 5 m from the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> line. The principal aspects considered in the comparison are: the influence of penetration through different soil layers, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil vibration transfer efficiency, the frequency content <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> and soil vibrations, and differences between toe- and shaft-generated vibrations. The main conclusions from this study are:  Most of the vibration loss occurs in the near field: 90 - 99 % <b>of</b> the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibration magnitude was dispersed within 0. 5 m from the driven <b>sheet</b> <b>pile.</b> Moreover, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> – soil vibration transfer efficiency was reduced for higher <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> acceleration levels and higher frequencies.  The soil characteristics strongly influence the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> vibration levels. A clear distinction could be made between "smooth" and "hard" driving, the latter being associated with an impact situation at the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> toe.  The focus of ground vibration studies should not only be the vertical vibrations. Indeed, the ground vibrations’ horizontal component was found to be of the same or even higher magnitude than the vertical component...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The seismic {{performance}} of port structures {{has been well}} documented following recent earthquakes, and indicates that port structures are highly susceptible to earthquake-induced damages. These damages are primarily due to soil liquefaction and the associated ground failures. <b>Sheet</b> <b>pile</b> bulkheads provide vital intermodal and lifeline transportation links between water-side and land-side traffic, and are waterfront structures particularly vulnerable to liquefaction-induced damages. Due to the prevalence of liquefaction-induced damages, many ports are utilizing soil improvement techniques to mitigate these hazards. Many port authorities have proposed utilizing performance-based design criteria to limit potential earthquake-induced damages. The current design method for <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls (Mononobe-Okabe) is based on simple, limit equilibrium analysis techniques, which are poorly suited for performance-based design. Recent advancements in the seismic design <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls have addressed some of the limitations of the current design methods, but are still inadequate for performing a complete, performance-based design for locations that contain potentially liquefiable soils and/or where soil improvement strategies have been instituted. This study has focused on conducting an empirical investigation and numerical modeling to determine the seismic performance <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls, and the performancebased benefit of soil improvement through densification. A case history validated, nonlinear effective stress computer program was used to perform numerical parametric studies on various design parameters (earthquake properties, depth <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> embedment, <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall stiffness, tie rod length, density of the backfill, and extent of soil densification). The results have been presented as a performance-based design method, and include a design chart that provides practitioners with a preliminary design tool that may be used to estimate the seismic deformations <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls with or without soil improvement. The study has demonstrated that soil densification can greatly reduce the seismicallyinduced deformations, especially when the magnitude of soil improvement extends beyond the location of the anchor. The study has also demonstrated that the use of soil densification techniques for mitigating seismic hazards may not be adequate in limiting deformations to allowable limits, and that other methods of soil improvement (cementation, drainage, etc.) or structural improvements may also be required...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the use of}} 3 D finite element method (FEM) in deep excavations, especially the simulation of sequential excavation method in 3 D FEM model. It is an independent research project based on the Spaarndammertunnel project in Amsterdam. This thesis only focused on the excavation part of the tunnel project. Soil parameters used in models were derived from in situ soil investigation. Cone penetration tests and boreholes were carried out along the tunnel location. The soil data was compared with Amsterdam North-South metro line database as well. The excavation plan, retaining structure and building material were developed from the preliminary design of this project. The data for soil investigation and preliminary design were provided by CRUX Engineering BV. The research focus {{was to investigate the}} advantages and disadvantages of applying 3 D FEM modelling for deep excavations. Since the construction of Spaarndammertunnel starts after the completion of this graduation project, no field data was available for verification. Instead, 2 D models were made for comparison and verification purpose. The soil and building material parameters were first tested in 2 D spring model and 2 D FEM model. The deflections <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls in both 2 D models were at similar level. The 3 D FEM model adopted the model set-up tested and adjusted in 2 D FEM model. Parametric study was done in order to investigate how the domain and mesh set-up influence the results in 3 D FEM model. Certain geometry (50 m * 18 m) of excavation section was determined so that the results from 3 D FEM model and 2 D FEM model were comparable. The excavation method applied in 2 D and 3 D FEM model was normal staged excavation. The excavation was designed to be dry excavation. After the comparison between 2 D and 3 D FEM model, the sequential excavation method was implemented into 3 D FEM model. Different excavation rates, excavation directions and lateral support design were tested in order to optimize the sequential excavation model. The responses <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls as well as surrounding soil were recorded and compared with results from normal 3 D excavation model. The parametric study of 3 D FEM model showed that the geometry of the excavation zone and the mesh set-up has great influence over the response <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall. If the excavation section was longer than 50 m, the whole domain can be considered as plain strain, so that the results in 2 D and 3 D FEM models were almost the same. If the section length was lowered from 50 m to 30 m, the bending <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall could be reduced by 20 %. This is because the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall can benefit from the corner effect in 3 D scenario. It is advised to apply 3 D FEM model when dimensions and shape of the excavation zone allows the model to maximize the corner effect. The mesh set-up is also crucial to 3 D FEM model. Coarse mesh leads to low accuracy results that certain stress points receiving much high stress than it should. Refine mesh requires a lot more time for calculation. For future research, it is still advised to perform field test for verification of 3 D FEM models. It is also recommended to test how lateral support like struts and wailing beam influence the performance <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall, especially the corners of excavation section. For the sequential excavation method in this project, the main benefit was to control the settlement of surrounding area. The effect of limiting the deflection and bending moments <b>of</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall by using sequential excavation was very limited. It is recommended to carry out the sequential excavation when the surrounding area is very sensitive to settlement that control of settlement is of high priorities. But for Spaarndammertunnel, the road near the tunnel is outside the influenced zone even if normal staged excavation is used. The modelling of sequential excavation requires a lot of time and effort, the execution requires even more time and effort. So the disadvantages of applying sequential excavation method in Spaarndammertunnel outweigh the advantages. Geo-engineeringGeoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|In {{geotechnical}} practice frequently use is made <b>of</b> steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls for soil and/or {{water retaining}} constructions. High demands {{are made with}} respect to the deformations, in particular in urban surroundings. Often these walls are composed of V- or Z-shaped profiles, whereby both profiles have their specific advantages and disadvantages. A common used variant is a <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall composed <b>of</b> so called double If-profiles. A double If-profile is made up of two single U-profiles which are connected by welding or crimping. A very specific property of the double If-profile is the rotation of the neutral axis. As a result <b>of</b> that, the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall tends to deflect both in forward (lateral) direction as well as in sideway (transverse) direction. This phenomenon is called oblique bending, and it results in a loss of stiffness and strength (compared to a continuous wall) and thus larger deformations. Oblique bending goes together with slip in the free interlocks and a transverse deflection <b>of</b> the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall relative to the soil body. Oblique bending might be influenced by the transverse bearing capacity of the soil, i. e. the soil reduces or even prevents the transverse deformation <b>of</b> the <b>sheet</b> <b>pile.</b> Besides, the shear stress in the free interlock possibly reduces oblique bending. The main goal {{of this study is to}} determine the transverse bearing capacity of the soil. Therefore a three dimensional finite element model is made <b>of</b> a cantilever <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall with a dry excavation in front and without friction in the sliding interlocks. This is a 'worst case' model, i. e. if a <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> wall is modelled in this way, oblique bending can be observed most clearly. Emphasis has been put on the generation of an appropriate mesh which is also useful for further investigations regarding oblique bending. Use is made of the finite element system DIANA, version 6. 1.

40|$|For {{almost a}} century, steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls are applied {{worldwide}} as earth retaining structures for excavations and quay walls. Within {{the framework of}} the development of European structural codes for Civil Engineering works, the Eurocodes, Eurocode 3 Part 5 for design <b>of</b> steel <b>sheet</b> <b>pile</b> walls was issued in 1997. This code offers possibilities for cheaper and safer steel <b>sheet</b> <b>piling,</b> in comparison with the existing design criteria used in most countries. Two of these design criteria with which so far few experience has been gained, have been closer investigated.

40|$|Iowa {{has about}} 22, 936 bridges on low-volume roads (LVRs). Based on the National Bridge Inventory data, 22 {{percent of the}} LVR bridges in Iowa are {{structurally}} deficient, while 5 {{percent of them are}} functionally obsolete. The substructure components (abutment and foundation elements) are known to be contributing factors for some of these poor ratings. Steel <b>sheet</b> <b>piling</b> was identified as a possible long-term option for LVR bridge substructures; but, due to lack of experience, Iowa needed investigation with regard to vertical and lateral load resistance, construction methods, design methodology, and load test performance.
