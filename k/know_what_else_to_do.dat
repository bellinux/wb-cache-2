500|$|Collins {{decided to}} record {{it in the}} late 1960s amid an {{atmosphere}} of counterculture introspection; {{she was part of}} an encounter group that ended a contentious meeting by singing [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] as it was the only song to which all the members knew the words. Her producer was present and suggested she include a version of it on her 1970 album Whales & Nightingales. Collins, who had a history of alcohol abuse, claimed that the song was able to [...] "pull her through" [...] to recovery. It was recorded in St. Paul's, the chapel at Columbia University, chosen for the acoustics. She chose an a cappella arrangement that was close to Edwin Othello Excell's, accompanied by a chorus of amateur singers who were friends of hers. Collins connected it to the Vietnam War, to which she objected: [...] "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> about the war in Vietnam. I had marched, I had voted, I had gone to jail on political actions and worked for the candidates I believed in. The war was still raging. There was nothing left to do, I thought... but sing 'Amazing Grace'." [...] Gradually and unexpectedly, the song began to be played on the radio, and then be requested. It rose to number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining on the charts for 15 weeks, as if, she wrote, her fans had been [...] "waiting to embrace it". In the UK, it charted 8 times between 1970 and 1972, peaking at number 5 and spending a total of 75 weeks on popular music charts. [...] Her rendition also reached number 5 in New Zealand and number 12 in Ireland in 1971.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Many reviews criticized the episode's {{lack of a}} cohesive plot. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a C rating, saying, Pool Party' was so loosely structured that it relied heavily on the characters to carry the narrative, {{and the result was}} some languid storytelling which gave me way too much time to think about missed opportunities, failed experiments, and the increasing burden of a show without any momentum." [...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote, [...] "There were bits and pieces of each story that worked in 'Pool Party,' but neither Robert's stroll through parties never had, nor Erin's endeavor to make Andy jealous, came together to make completely funny or interesting tales." [...] The Huffington Post wrote that, [...] "Once , the plot bits were so loose it might have been difficult for casual fans to follow it all." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, Pool Party' was one of those episodes where you can tell the writers didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do....</b> This is filler, really, which unfortunately tends to be unavoidable when you do 22-episode seasons and you're eight years in." [...] Many reviews were critical of the continued Erin-Andy romance taking center-stage. McNutt wrote, [...] "I still really do not care about Andy and Erin as a relationship. The show's approach to this storyline... is to have Andy enjoying a fairly normal evening with his girlfriend Jessica while Erin acts like a crazy person {{in an effort to get}} his attention." [...] Forecella noted that, while the Erin and Dwight pairing was funny, their attempts to make Andy jealous were not successful, as Andy's sub-plots were deemed not funny and [...] "boring." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ellison did a {{teaching}} qualification at Exeter University, [...] "because I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> – I never thought I'd use it ... I hadn't even planned {{to stay on}} in education past 16: I wanted to join the Royal Marines, but problems with my back prevented that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We'll give Tom's {{assumed name}} and a short {{description}} of him, and ask that he be held for us {{at one of the}} ports," [...] said Dick. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very sorry}} for you," [...] said Barton, simply. He did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> say; but he felt more than his {{conventional}} words indicated, and perhaps {{he looked as if}} he felt it and more.|$|R
2500|$|According to Donnelly, {{the band}} {{had been working}} {{together}} for five years, stating that if she didn't have the band, she wouldn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with her life. She described the band {{as a work of}} passion, citing sources of influences such as the bands Misfits, Blondie and Iron Maiden, and singer Courtney Love. The Misfits in particular were a large influence to the album; their horror themed and often purposely over-the-top style to making music were important in shaping the way the band presented themselves in image. Donelly expressed an interest with progressing the style of music on their sophomoric effort, stating that she wanted to have a tighter focus this time around, and specifically noting that the song titles on Fantastic Wounds were more direct and confident in nature. Speaking about the creation of the project, she mused: ...|$|E
60|$|She gave it royally, {{while the}} other was there {{pressing}} at her breast. Duane took the proffered hand. He did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "But I don't {{believe their}} yarn about bein' left behind, {{unless they were}} up to some {{mischief}} an' the captain didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is a {{trouble that}} {{requires}} time to cure it," [...] she said,--not meaning {{to imply that}} time would cure it by enabling the girl to forget her lover; but because in truth she had not <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> say.|$|R
5000|$|The Wildcats' defense, so solid all night, forced two Masoli fumbles but couldn't recover them.That {{only made}} it worse. [...] "We let {{a lot of}} good things slip away," [...] safety Cam Nelson said. [...] "I don't really <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{captain had}} nothing to do with it," [...] {{answered}} Dick, as he gave her hand an extra squeeze, which he somehow thought she returned. [...] "We came because we were having a lot of trouble, and didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|R
60|$|The wildcat {{had been}} brought along, and during the {{afternoon}} Snap skinned the carcass and hung the pelt up to cure. The carcass was thrown away, as they did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was Koane's fault,' {{answered}} Thakane. 'He {{would not}} take the cattle to feed until he drank some of the milk from Koumongoe. So, as I did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> I gave it to him.' ...|$|E
60|$|At Ryde the guard, by superhuman effort, {{contrived}} {{to keep us}} {{a carriage}} to ourselves. I gave him a shilling, because I did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I {{would have made it}} half-a-sovereign if he had put eight other passengers in with us. At every station people came to the window to look in at us.|$|E
60|$|The {{little boy}} took three steps at an {{increased}} pace, then fell behind again. His black {{eyes seemed to}} answer: 'You say that because you don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> say.' And without alteration in their giraffe-like formation, but again in silence, the three proceeded.|$|R
60|$|So it {{was when}} the {{discovery}} came upon poor old Mrs. Dayman (I do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> call her), that Fulk Torwood Trevor, the husband of her youth, was not dead, but was Earl of Trevorsham; married, and the father of four children in England.|$|R
60|$|Poor girl, {{she did not}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> say; she was not of {{a nervous}} disposition, but there was {{something}} about George's manner that alarmed her very much, and she glanced anxiously around to see if any one was within call, but the place was lonely as the grave.|$|R
60|$|Dorothy obeyed. She ran at once {{behind the}} Nome King, {{who was still}} trying to free his eyes from the egg, and in a {{twinkling}} she had unbuckled his splendid jeweled belt and carried it away with her to her place beside the Tiger and Lion, where, because she did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it, she fastened it around her own slim waist.|$|E
60|$|Whenever a German railway-guard feels lonesome, {{and does}} not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with himself, he takes a walk round the train, and gets the {{passengers}} to show him their tickets, after which he returns to his box cheered and refreshed. Some people rave about sunsets and mountains and old masters; but to the German railway-guard the world can show nothing more satisfying, more inspiring, than {{the sight of a}} railway-ticket.|$|E
60|$|Why did {{he still}} follow the sea? Because {{he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> When he was younger, he used to love it, but now he hated it. Yet {{there was not a}} prettier life in the world if you got to be captain. He used to hope for that once, but not now; though he thought he could {{navigate}} a ship. Only let him get his family together again, and he would-- yes, he would--try to do something ashore.|$|E
5000|$|... "It's a disgusting industry. I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> say. Especially now. I can't stomach most of {{the movies}} about women. I just saw a movie last night. I don't want to say the name - but again with the fucking wedding and the only time women say {{anything}} is about men." ...|$|R
60|$|Paul was {{perfectly}} {{well aware that}} he had repeated those words before, and he was doing so for the very good reason {{that he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> say; but the ghost's command confused him, and he stood silent and motionless, resolved to remain quiet rather than make a mistake.|$|R
6000|$|... "People {{are eating}} large {{quantities}} of wheat flour simply because they don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> eat," [...] Irene continued. [...] "Now, corn, properly prepared, is far more delicious and equally as nourishing as wheat. The trouble is that people don't {{know how to use}} corn-meal and corn-flour to the best advantage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In England, Miss Regina." [...] He {{tried to}} take her hand--but she kept {{it out of his}} reach. [...] "In London," [...] he went on, {{drifting}} back into his customary plainness of speech. [...] "In this very street," [...] he resumed, seizing her hand before she was aware of him. Too much bewildered to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> Regina took refuge desperately in shaking hands with him. [...] "Goodbye, Mr. Goldenheart," [...] she said--and gave him his dismissal for the second time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know. Alice"--she {{spoke the}} word {{with a little}} hesitation--"said {{something}} to {{me the other day}} about charity, and all that. Well, now, I'm helping mother's church--a little--and I'm helping up at Sibley, but I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I suppose I ought to do some good with the money that's rolling in on us. I've got my house pretty well stocked and fitted up, and I'm about stumped. I can't sit down, and just eat and sleep, ride and drive, can I?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was glad}} to sit down, {{and he said to}} himself that now he would stay there, and keep a good lookout for the chaps that had robbed him. But again he fell asleep, and he did not wake now till the sun was high, and the paths of the Common were filled with hurrying people. He sat where he had slept, for he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> or where to go. Sometimes he thought he would go to Mr. Sewell, and ask him for money enough to get home; but he could not do it; he could more easily starve.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentleman {{is such a}} frightful word to have to use to a gentleman; but I did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> say. Mamma, if you please, we won't {{talk about}} it;--not about the letter I mean. As for him, I'll talk about him for ever if you like it. I don't mean {{to be a bit}} broken-hearted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stay. But then it adds, {{that sign}} {{is not always}} to be relied on; for some good bills get so worn, the red marks get rubbed out. And that's the case with my bill here--see how old it is--or else it's a counterfeit, or else--I don't see right--or else--dear, dear me--I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> think." ...|$|R
2500|$|While {{still in}} Kenya, Blixen {{had written to}} her brother Thomas, [...] "I have begun {{to do what we}} {{brothers}} and sisters do when we don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> resort to, I have started to write a book. ... I have been writing in English because I thought it would be more profitable." [...] On returning to Denmark, she continued writing in earnest.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{means to}} try again for his degree, and he is going up to study before term. I have advised him to do that. I don't urge him to enter the Church--on the contrary. But if he will go and work so as to pass, that will be some {{guarantee}} that he has energy and a will; and he is quite at sea; he doesn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> So far he will please his father, and I have promised in the mean time to try and reconcile Vincy to his son's adopting some other line of life. Fred says frankly he is not fit for a clergyman, and I would do anything I could to hinder {{a man from the}} fatal step of choosing the wrong profession. He quoted to me what you said, Miss Garth--do you remember it?" [...] (Mr. Farebrother used to say [...] "Mary" [...] instead of [...] "Miss Garth," [...] but it was part of his delicacy to treat her with the more deference because, according to Mrs. Vincy's phrase, she worked for her bread.) ...|$|E
60|$|The boarder who had eloped was {{a student}} at the {{theological}} seminary, and he had really gone to visit his family, so that he had a fairly good conscience in giving this color {{to the fact that he}} was leaving the place permanently because he could not bear it any longer. It was a shade of deceit to connive with his room-mate for the custody of his carpet-bag and the few socks and collars and the one shirt and summer coat which did not visibly affect its lankness when gathered into it from his share of the bureau-drawers; but he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and he trusted to a final forgiveness when all the facts were considered by a merciful providence. His board was fully paid, and he had suffered long. He argued with his room-mate that he could do no good by remaining, and that he would have stayed if he could have believed there was any use. Besides, the food was undermining his health, and the room with that broken window had given him a cold already. He had a right to go, and it was his duty to himself and the friends who were helping him through the seminary not to get sick.|$|E
60|$|He did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with himself, and he {{went down}} to the reading-room. He found Bittridge there, smoking a cigar, and the young man companionably offered to bestow one upon him; but the judge stiffly refused, saying he did not wish to smoke just then. He noted that Bittridge was still in his {{character}} of family favorite, and his hand trembled as he passed it over the smooth knob of his stick, while he sat waiting for the fellow to take himself away. But Bittridge had apparently no thought of going. He was looking at the amusements for the evening in a paper he had bought, and he wished to consult the judge as to which was the best theatre to go to that night; {{he said he wanted to}} take his mother. Kenton professed not to know much about the New York theatres, and then Bittridge guessed he must get the clerk to tell him. But still he did not part with the judge. He sat down beside him, and told him how glad he was to see his family looking so well, especially Miss Ellen; he could not remember ever seeing her so strong-looking. He said that girl had captured his mother, who was in love with pretty much the whole Kenton family, though.|$|E
5000|$|The Boston Globe {{wrote that}} Rotello, “…cogently rethinks the {{epidemic}} as the ecologically enabled result of HIV's biology and post-Stonewall gay sex…He seeks ‘a sustainable gay culture, {{one that does}} not destroy the very souls it liberates’ with a sexual ecology that must constantly add unnatural appliances, ranging from condoms to pills <b>to</b> who <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>else,</b> <b>to</b> keep its members alive.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do," [...] she was saying. [...] "Father was gone, and we {{kids had}} to rustle.

I wasn't much stuck on it though, after I got here, and I'd have left only--" ...|$|R
