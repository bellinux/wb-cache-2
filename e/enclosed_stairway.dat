60|$|La Fleur {{was in the}} hall, {{where for}} some time she had been quietly standing, looking out upon the moonlight. From her position, which was not a {{conspicuous}} one, {{at the door of}} the <b>enclosed</b> <b>stairway,</b> she had been able to keep her eyes upon Ralph and Cicely; and held herself ready, should she hear Mrs. Drane coming down the stairs, to go up and engage her in a consultation in regard to domestic arrangements. She had known of the arrival of the telegraph boy, had seen what followed, and now listened with rapt delight to Cicely's almost breathless announcement of the joyful news.|$|E
50|$|This {{station has}} one {{high-level}} island platform accessible by <b>enclosed</b> <b>stairway</b> from West 225th Street. The platform is short; when trains stop at this station, only four cars can receive and discharge passengers.|$|E
50|$|Matthew Lowber House is a {{historic}} home located at Magnolia, Kent County, Delaware. It was built in 1774, and is a two-story, three bay, brick dwelling, with a two bay frame addition added about 1855. The interior has excellent panelling, the original wide floor boards, and a winding <b>enclosed</b> <b>stairway.</b>|$|E
50|$|Elegant black painted {{cast iron}} {{railings}} <b>enclosing</b> the <b>stairway</b> {{down to the}} former public lavatory beneath.|$|R
50|$|The house {{originally}} {{had a single}} room underneath a gable roof {{on either side of}} the breezeway, but as Snow prospered, rooms were added on either side underneath a shed roof. <b>Enclosed</b> <b>stairways</b> lead from the central rooms to the upper floor. The open central breezeway was eventually enclosed and the exterior covered in clapboard. The rearmost portion of the dogtrot was left open, forming a recessed porch. The main entrance consists of a double-leaf door with simple sidelights and transom. The interior log walls are covered with horizontal boarding and a chair rail and baseboard. The house also features primitive Federal fireplace mantels. In the 1960s, the entry was replaced with a modern stoop.|$|R
50|$|Rather than {{standard}} gates, the stadium had solid corrugated steel shutters {{at the bottom}} of tunnels that connected the street level, via several flights of steps, to the seating areas above. These shutters were closed as they normally were at every game. Panicked spectators moving down the <b>enclosed</b> <b>stairways</b> pressed those in the lead against the closed shutters, but this was not visible to the crowd pushing down the stairwells from behind. The shutters finally burst outward as a result of pressure from the crush of bodies inside. All of those that died were killed in the stairwells down to the street level, most from internal haemorrhaging or asphyxia. No one who stayed inside the stadium died. In the street, the crowd caused destruction on private property around the stadium.|$|R
50|$|An <b>enclosed</b> <b>stairway</b> leads up to {{the second}} story. There, a wider central hall {{separates}} three bedrooms and a bathroom. The floors are also random plank; the ceilings are low, about 6 feet 11 inches (83 in). Another set of stairs leads to the attic, where adzed beams and numbered, pegged roof framing are visible along with the change in chimney materials.|$|E
50|$|With no {{economic}} constraints on construction, {{the goal was}} to create a bridge of symbolic importance.This bridge represented the soaring aspirations of the city of Seville in preparation for Expo '92, and is visible from the top of La Giralda, the former minaret which is the sentimental roof of the city, linking Seville's past and present. Similar to the Brooklyn Bridge, there is an elevated walkway for pedestrians. In addition to the elevated walkway, the Alamillo Bridge features a lookout {{at the top of the}} mast, accessible by an <b>enclosed</b> <b>stairway.</b>|$|E
50|$|The ranger {{station is}} a 26 ft by 26 ft cabin, 1-1/2 stories high with a front gable and a lean-to porch across the front. The cabin {{originally}} rested on wood piles. The walls are of rounded log construction, squared {{on the inside}} and then sheathed with beaded panels for the interior finish. There are three rooms on the cabin's main level: a living room in the front and a bedroom and kitchen in the back. The attic is an unfinished space, reached by an <b>enclosed</b> <b>stairway</b> from the living space below. An excavated root cellar is under the kitchen. The 1-1/2 story high log construction at the gable ends is unusual in a building of this type, where the triangular gable areas are usually filled in with framing and shingles.|$|E
5000|$|The Thomas Holland House was a {{historic}} residence near Hillsboro, Alabama. The {{house was built}} around 1836 by Thomas Holland, a South Carolinian {{who had come to}} Lawrence County, Alabama, in 1823. Holland began his plantation with 40 acres (16 ha) and built it to over 2100 acres (850 ha) by 1849. The house was a full two-story dogtrot house constructed of logs, one of the only of its type in Alabama. The exterior had since been covered in clapboard, and the breezeway had been finished with vertical boards and a chair rail. <b>Enclosed</b> <b>stairways</b> in each lower room gave access to the upper floor; the central room over the dogtrot was only accessible from the eastern room. [...] The house was listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage and the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.|$|R
50|$|The east lobby {{includes}} the two elevators and main stairway for the building. The elevators are set into a marble surround and feature paneled bronze doors decorated with flower medallions. Each elevator surround includes a glazed, bronze-colored, plaster transom, inlaid with a floral motif. The partially <b>enclosed,</b> original <b>stairway</b> {{is located on}} {{the south end of the}} lobby opposite the two elevators. The stairway is made of marble treads, decorative bronze railing, and a simple wood handrail.|$|R
50|$|The village's older {{system of}} small wooden schoolhouses {{was no longer}} {{adequate}} to educate its children to the level society desired, and Washington was commissioned as its first modern school. Architect Wilson Potter, of New York City, specialized in school buildings. He included a number of modern features that had already become standard on other institutional buildings of the era, such as large windows to let in natural light, partially <b>enclosed</b> steel <b>stairways</b> to provide better fire safety, and central heating.|$|R
5000|$|... "Upstairs, {{the second}} floor follows a central-hall plan. Here the left front room served as the Smoot's nursery, and the right front as their master bedroom. Their {{original}} bedroom furniture remains. Beyond each of these chambers, {{on each side of}} the hall, is another bedroom, and in the rear wing there is a bath and maid's room. Between the servant's chamber and the right, rear bedroom, a narrow <b>enclosed</b> <b>stairway</b> rises to the unfinished attic and descends to the kitchen. The Smoot House sits on a tree-shaded, corner lot and retains part of the wrought-iron fence that once surrounded the property. In the rear stands a small, rectangular, gable-roofed, frame garage or carriage house. An office building occupies the lot rear of the Smoot House, but the neighborhood remains essentially residential (National Park Service p. 2)." ...|$|E
50|$|The South Reading Schoolhouse {{stands in}} central {{southern}} Reading, {{just west of}} the rural village of South Reading at the junction of Tyler and Bartley Roads. It is a two-story stone structure, with gabled roof topped by a square belfry with pyramidal roof. Although nominally Greek Revival in style, it is nearly devoid of ornamentation due to its stone construction. The building ends are two bays wide, and the sides four, with sash windows in rectangular openings, and the main entrance in the leftmost bay of the facade facing Tyson Road. A wood frame shed is attached to {{the west side of the}} building. The interior consists of two large classroom spaces, one on each floor, with an <b>enclosed</b> <b>stairway</b> on one side. Original floorboards have been covered with modern maple flooring, and the walls are wainscoted and plastered.|$|E
50|$|The church {{interior}} {{consists of}} one single room; the vestry, which is situated behind the sanctuary proper, is {{in a later}} addition to the building. There are two main aisles in the nave; these are formed by {{the placement of the}} original pews in the building. Of the pews, those in the center are freestanding, and larger than those on the sides; these have been angled slightly and attached to the side walls. There is a gallery in the south wall, with one center aisle and two down its sides. It is supported by a pair of Doric columns on the side walls, as well as by a number of pilasters. There is a dentiled entablature, set above the columns and topped by a railing with turned balusters. Entry to the gallery is achieved via an <b>enclosed</b> <b>stairway</b> on the east side; one wall is fitted with beaded diagonal paneling, and there is no stair rail.|$|E
50|$|Dancers {{are very}} {{specific}} {{on where they}} do their rituals. Certain dances are more private while other are public events that fill stadiums. One Spanish explorer describes a performance he watched as eight hundred heavy warriors danced in a giant stadium. Not one of the warriors were off beat as they danced all day with food and drink brought to them as they danced. Diego Garcia de Palacio compared a courtyard <b>enclosed</b> by <b>stairways</b> in Copan to the Colosseum in Rome. Dances were mostly public rituals showing community by people being different social classes on stage. These stages were normally large centers, public zones or palace compounds which the elites would use more.|$|R
50|$|Three {{years after}} the school was built, land was {{purchased}} to expand it. Lincoln School was built in Bettendorf in 1917 and this building's name was changed to Washington School. Davenport architect Arthur Ebeling was hired to design an addition to the building and it was built by Ownes and Bevins. The expansion included four classrooms, an office area, as well as electricity and bathrooms, which were {{not a part of}} the original building. The seventh and eighth grade classes were moved to the new Bettendorf Junior High School in 1951, and sixth grade was moved there in 1963. Moline, Illinois architect William F. Bernbrock designed a 1957 remodeling project that included <b>enclosing</b> the <b>stairways,</b> adding dropped acoustical ceilings, and removal the original slate roof and replacing it with asbestos. Enrollment at the school dropped to 200 students in 1965 and it was down to 120 students when it closed in 1973.|$|R
500|$|The {{building}} Donnell {{purchased in}} 1979 had declined badly. The Dearborn entrances {{had been closed}} in, the ground floor had been [...] "defaced by garish signs", and the brick had been painted and was peeling. Inside, the marble wainscoting had been painted over {{and many of the}} original oak doors had been replaced with cheaper mahogany. The decorative stair rails had been <b>enclosed,</b> and some <b>stairways</b> and corridors had been closed off completely. Much of the original mosaic tile had been demolished—some floors were carpeted, others tiled in vinyl or terrazzo. Half of the sixteen elevators were still manually operated. [...] "It was {{as if it had been}} partly updated every ten years throughout its history", said Donnell, [...] "it was never done over in its entirety." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the house follows a hall and parlor plan. There was once a partition creating a center hall. The walls of the interior are flush sheathed. Each of the two downstairs has a massive fireplace with transitional Georgian/Federal Style mantel. While the mantels differ somewhat in detail, each is segmentally arched above the firebox and has side pilasters, a paneled frieze, and a heavy multi-layered shelf which is blocked outward at each corner and in the center. These mantels bear a strong similarity to the one found at the John R. Campbell House, located about {{one and a half}} miles west of the Perciphull Campbell House. A partially <b>enclosed</b> <b>stairway</b> winds from the right hand room upward to the second story. The second story consists of one large room covered with hand-planed, random-width sheathing. The only interior alterations consist primarily of linoleum-covered floors downstairs and plywood paneling and tile ceiling in the left-hand first story room.|$|E
50|$|Ray Wiseman House is a {{historic}} home located at Altamont, Avery County, North Carolina. It was built in 1941, and is a one-story, Arts-and-Crafts bungalow-reflecting the American Craftsman influence. It {{is considered one of}} the best examples of Arts and Crafts architecture in the region. The home is a good example of an upper middle class home of the 1940s. The interior includes well crafted chestnut woodwork and red oak floors. The floor plan includes two large bedroom suites with a private sunroom for one and a large attic/loft space with <b>enclosed</b> <b>stairway.</b> The sun room still features rare 1940's original wall paper. The original plumbing fixtures stamped (1941) can still be found in the original main bathroom off the center hall and a modern second bathroom has been added to the master bedroom. It is constructed of native river rock and is approximately 1,400 square feet. It sits on 1.5 acres of land carved out of hills to form the original roadbed for the highway in front of the property.|$|E
5000|$|Built of weatherboarded walls {{set on a}} stone foundation, the Ausenbaugh-McElhenny House {{is covered}} with an asphalt roof and {{features}} smaller elements of stone and wood. [...] Decorative elements of the stonework include rusticated blocks on the exterior courses of the foundation, {{as well as the}} use of large stone blocks for the stairs from the ground to the entry porch, a large wooden structure. The overall plan resembles the letter [...] "T" [...] with some changes; including a one-story extension at the letter's base, as well as the presence of the shed-roofed porch in the side ell. Aside from the single-story extension, the house is a two-story building with walls that rise to gables. Both rounded and rectangular windows pierce the walls, while the porch-facing main entrance assumes the latter shape. Detailed Gothic-styled woodwork is placed {{at the peak of the}} gables, while a small chimney sits at the peak of the roof near the right end of the crosspiece of the [...] "T". [...] Inside, the design is simple but not ostentatious, its styling concentrating on the use of walnut-wood trim. The second story is accessed through an <b>enclosed</b> <b>stairway</b> with an ogive-shaped entryway located near the foyer.|$|E
60|$|By feeling {{along the}} brick wall she brought up, with a sudden bump, {{at the back of}} the stairway. Then she deliberated. If she went around to the front so as to get access to the steps, she might pass in range of the loiterer whom she mistrusted. That risk she would not incur. Examining the wall that <b>enclosed</b> the box-like <b>stairway</b> as best she could in the dark, she found it rickety, full of holes and cracks, and she decided she would climb it. A sheer {{perpendicular}} board wall, some twelve or fifteen feet high, shrouded in pitchy darkness and apparently within earshot of a police spy, did not daunt Bessy Bell. Slipping her strong fingers in crevices and her slim toes in cracks, she climbed up and up, till she got hold of the railing post on the first platform. Here she had great difficulty to keep from falling, but lifting and squirming her supple body, by a desperate effort she got her knees on the platform, and then pulled herself to safety. Once on the stairs she ran up the remaining few steps to the landing, where she rested panting and triumphant.|$|R
5|$|Based on a {{courtyard}} house layout, externally the harled whinstone rubble mansion {{is a combination}} of Elizabethan and Jacobean (or Gothic) design, similar to Smith's work at Slains. A spacious central courtyard is surrounded by buildings three storeys high. Within the back of the courtyard, circular towers <b>enclose</b> the service <b>stairways.</b> A large Elizabethan-style tower housing the main stairway is also set within the courtyard but sited to the front behind the reception rooms. Other external features include: canted and box bays; a variety of lofty towers that are round, square or octagonal; many different gables; and numerous diagonally set stone flues. The southeast facing front elevation lacks symmetry with the main Tudor style entranceway set off centre and extending out. A plaque commemorating the building dates of 1839–1842 and a central armorial are above the round arched entrance. There is also an eight-sided tower positioned at the front corner. A separate driveway accesses the outside kitchen yard {{at the back of the}} north west elevation. This side of the mansion is plainer, more restrained and built into the slope of the hillside. A lengthy one storey lean-to houses fuel supplies and servants toilets and provides additional ground support. The northeast elevation is also more architecturally reserved than the front.|$|R
50|$|Mayhew {{designed}} his {{own house}} in collaboration with Serge Chermayeff, associate architect and employee of Mayhew's during 1940 - 1941 when Chermayeff was also teaching at California School of Fine Arts. Chermayeff was brought in so that Mayhew would not have his own wife for a client. The house contrasted sharply with existing homes on Hampton Road, {{and appeared to be}} made of rectangular shapes descending the sloped property. The house divided into two functional groups, one for adults and one for children, with all living and sleeping rooms facing south. Glass walls were specified to allow maximum sunlight and viewing pleasure. The two main structural units enclosed a private garden and were connected by a broad <b>stairway</b> <b>enclosed</b> against the weather, with the street side made of solid wood and the garden side fully glazed. The three children's rooms were separated with demountable hanging walls that could be changed to adapt to the family's needs. Author Alan Hess wrote in 2007 that the clean abstraction of the rectilinear blocks appeared to be based on Chermayeff's Bauhaus leanings but that the casual, site-specific interaction of garden, house and modernity showed the relaxation of California living apparent in Mayhew's prior work.|$|R
