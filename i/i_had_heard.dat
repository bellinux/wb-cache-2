I was {{particularly}} moved by his Salt March to the Sea and his numerous fasts. The {{whole concept of}} Satyagraha (Satya is truth which equals love, and agraha is force; Satyagraha, therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant to me. As I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see {{for the first time}} its potency in the area of social reform." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of the Breckinridges were Whigs, but John Breckinridge's posthumous {{influence}} inclined {{his grandson}} toward the Democratic Party. Additionally, John C. Breckinridge's friend and law partner, Thomas W. Bullock, {{was from a}} Democratic family. In 1842, Bullock told Breckinridge {{that by the time}} they opened their practice in Burlington, Iowa, [...] "you were two-thirds of a Democrat"; living in heavily Democratic Iowa Territory further distanced him from Whiggery. He wrote weekly editorials in the Democratic Iowa Territorial Gazette and Advisor, and in February 1843, he was named to the Des Moines County Democratic committee. A letter from Breckinridge's brother-in-law related that, when Breckinridge's uncle William learned that his nephew had [...] "become loco-foco", he said, [...] "I felt as I would have done if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> that my daughter had been dishonored." [...] On a visit to Kentucky in 1843, Breckinridge met and married Mary Cyrene Burch, ending his time in Iowa.|$|E

500|$|Rodriguez wrote Machete in 1993 {{as a full}} {{feature for}} Danny Trejo. [...] "I had cast him in Desperado and I {{remember}} thinking, 'Wow, this guy should have his own series of Mexploitation movies like Charles Bronson or like Jean-Claude Van Damme.' So I wrote him this idea of a federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> sometimes FBI or DEA have a really tough job that they don't {{want to get their}} own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, 'That's Machete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for {{a lot of money to}} him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts.' But I never got around to making it." [...] The trailer was made into a feature film which was released in September 2010; a sequel, Machete Kills (2013), followed.|$|E
500|$|Breckinridge {{remained}} in Lexington while deciding {{where to begin}} practice, borrowing law books from the library of John J. Crittenden, Thomas Crittenden's father. Deciding that Lexington was overcrowded with lawyers, he moved to Frankfort, {{but was unable to}} find an office. After being spurned by a love interest, he and former classmate Thomas W. Bullock departed for the Iowa Territory on October 10, 1841 seeking better opportunities. Journeying westward, they considered settling on land Breckinridge had inherited in Jacksonville, Illinois, but they found the bar stocked with able men like Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln. They continued on to Burlington, Iowa, and by the winter of 1842–1843, Breckinridge reported to family members that his firm handled more cases than almost any other in Burlington. Influenced by Bullock and the citizens of Iowa, he identified with the Democratic Party, and by February 1843, he had been named to the Democratic committee of Des Moines County. Most of the Kentucky Breckinridges were Whigs, and when he learned of his nephew's party affiliation, William Breckinridge declared, [...] "I felt as I would have done if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> that my daughter had been dishonored." ...|$|E
500|$|The phrase has a riposte: [...] "And Banagher {{beats the}} Devil!". The origins {{of this are}} more {{difficult}} to trace but it does feature in a work by the Irish writer Brian Oswald Donn-Byrne, Messer Marco Polo (1925), p.25, and it is in common usage in Ireland. Trollope asserted on his arrival in Ireland, [...] "I was to live at a place called Banagher on the Shannon which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> of because of its having once been conquered, though it had heretofore conquered everything, including the Devil". Interestingly, a John O'Donovan, in an Ordnance Survey letter for King's County in 1838, attempts to trace the origins of the name Banagher. He states: [...] "Of all the words which enter into Irish nomenclature Beannchair seems the most difficult of explanation" [...] and goes on to say [...] "This name 'beats the Devil.'" [...] M.F. Kenny in his 2003 book Marathon Marriage uses a story of the devil losing a game of cards to a blacksmith named Banagher at the Black Stile at Garry Castle on the road between Banagher and Birr, as an explanation for the phrase.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} stages of the album's development, it was {{promoted}} as an album of [...] "high-energy hip-hop." [...] Republic Records later described the album's musical style as [...] "aggressive rock" [...] in the stages preceding the album's release. Vanilla Ice referred to the album's musical style as [...] "skate rock." [...] The album's dark and thick sound fuses elements of heavy metal, punk rock and hip hop. Vanilla Ice stated that [...] "I wanted to express myself in a very intense way, and there was no way it was going to happen with a drum machine. Basically, I'm bored with drum machines and samples and stuff. With a band, they can build the energy around me." [...] Many critics have noticed a similarity between the style of music present on Hard to Swallow and that of bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Vanilla Ice stated that although he knew of the bands, he [...] "didn't even listen to [...] any of them" [...] before he made the album, and he was not trying to imitate the musical style of the bands. [...] "It's just we have the same producer, and some of the guitars between that and Limp Bizkit are gonna sound similar. That's what happens when you've got the same guy producing them. [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> the Deftones more than any of them." ...|$|E

But that's not at all what she had said: her words were being misrepresented so that her message might be more easily attacked. 'She was referring to the complacency of the ratings agencies and investment advisers who say there is nothing to worry about,' said a person at 60 Minutes who reviewed the transcripts of the interview for me, to make sure <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> what I thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard.</b> She says there is something to worry about, and it will be apparent to everyone in the next 12 months." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{carriers}} {{called them}} [...] "monkey cups," [...] a name <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> elsewhere {{in reference to}} Nepenthes, but the implication that monkeys drink the pitcher fluid seemed farfetched. I later proved it true. In Sarawak I found an orangutan that had been raised as a pet and later freed. As I approached it gingerly in the forest, I offered it a half-full pitcher. To my surprise, the ape accepted it and, with the finesse of a lady at tea, executed a delicate bottoms-up.|$|E
2500|$|The poet Max Jacob said {{he came to}} Montparnasse to [...] "sin disgracefully", but Marc Chagall {{summed it}} up {{differently}} when he explained why {{he had gone to}} Montparnasse: [...] "I aspired to see with my own eyes what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> of from so far away: this revolution of the eye, this rotation of colours, which spontaneously and astutely merge with one another in a flow of conceived lines.

2500|$|The playwright August Strindberg {{also set}} scenes from his play A Dream Play {{in a place}} called [...] "Fingal's Grotto".

He knew, and I feared, he was dying, though I did not admit it. He bade me go to his library and select a book.

2500|$|In February 1893, at a Royal Albert Hall {{performance}} of Gounod's Redemption (with Miss Palliser and Watkin Mills), {{he thought she}} sang 'While my watch I am keeping' 'with a gentler vocal touch and a nearer approach to purely lyric style than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> from her before', saying she might now become the successor of Mme Belle Cole. In April 1893, at a Philharmonic concert (also featuring Sapellnikoff in Chopin's E major concerto), [...] "happening to be tremendously in the dramatic vein, she positively rampaged through a Schiller-Joachim scena and through Beethoven's Creation Hymn, scandalizing the Philharmonic, but carrying away the multitude." ...|$|E
2500|$|Debussy {{had promised}} {{the role of}} Mélisande to Maeterlinck's {{companion}} Georgette Leblanc and had even rehearsed the part with her privately. But Albert Carré became keen on a new Scottish singer, Mary Garden, who had captivated the Parisian public when she {{had taken over the}} lead role in Gustave Charpentier's Louise shortly after its premiere in 1900. Debussy was at first reluctant to comply with Carré but when he heard Garden sing, he was so impressed that he later recalled: [...] "That was the gentle voice that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> in my inmost being, with its hesitantly tender and captivating charm, such that I had barely dared to hope for." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{last known}} {{survivor}} of the accident, Peter Stoddart, was interviewed in Wisbech by Michael Simkins in around 1985.

'That was true. I saw that. He was a Scottish gentleman, eventually a millionaire. But he had to.' There was a suspicion of a chuckle in his voice as he added: 'And there were one or two other survivors who made themselves scarce. They took their opportunity.'"
