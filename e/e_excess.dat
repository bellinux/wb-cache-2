The mid-infrared emission is resolved {{for the first time}} into the two components UZ Tau E and UZ Tau W. The mid-infrared excess deduced for UZ Tau W appears to be much lower than that observed for UZ Tau <b>E.</b> This <b>excess</b> emission is consistent with an optically thin circumstellar disk in the case of UZ Tau W, whereas UZ Tau <b>E's</b> <b>excess</b> is consistent with an optically thick disk. We suggest that the close binary star pair in UZ Tau W is responsible for the observed difference between UZ Tau E and W's mid-infrared excess. In the proposed model, the binary star interacts with the local circumstellar disk environment and clears out much of the material inside its orbital radius (approximately 50 AU). As a result, the hot dust, observed at mid-infrared wavelengths, in UZ Tau W is suppressed compared to its 'wider' companion UZ Tau E. This scenario can also plausibly account for differences observed in UZ Tau E's and UZ Tau W's optical line strengths and profiles...|$|R

40|$|The Dissertation {{is focused}} on the studies of {{associations}} between functional elements in human genome and their nucleotide structure. The asymmetry in nucleotide content (skew, bias) was chosen as the main feature for nucleotide structure. A significant difference in nucleotide content asymmetry was found for human exons vs. introns. Specifically, exon sequences display bias for purines (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>excess</b> of A and G over C and T), while introns exhibit keto-amino skew (i. <b>e.</b> <b>excess</b> of G and T over A and C). The extents of these biases depend upon gene expression patterns. The highest intronic keto-amino skew is found in the introns of housekeeping genes. In the case of introns, whose sequences are under weak repair system, the AT->GC and CG->TA substitutions are preferentially accumulated. A comparative analysis of gene sequences encoding cytochrome P 450 2 E 1 of Homo sapiens and representative mammals was done.

Because prepubertal ovarian production of E differs quantitatively and qualitatively from chronic E replacement, {{we tested the}} hypothesis that postnatal E exacerbates the consequences of prenatal T on the positive, but not the negative, steroid feedback controls of GnRH secretion. Our approach was to characterize prepubertal sensitivity to E negative feedback, the onset and maintenance of progestagenic cycles, and the LH surge response in ovary intact, prenatally untreated (control), and T-treated (T) sheep that were exposed postnatally to only endogenous E, or exposed to <b>excess</b> <b>E</b> by sc implant.

Molecular interactions in the system have been studied in the light of variation of excess values of calculated properties and these properties have been fitted to Redlich-Mister type polynomial equation. Further, Lennard-Jones potential repulsive exponent term (n) and relative association (R-A) are computed and interpreted to elucidate the molecular interactions in the liquid mixture. The present investigation also comprises evaluation of the acoustic non-linearity parameter (B/A) in the mixtures and calculation of cohesive energy Delta A, Van der Wall's constants (a, b) and distance of the closest approach (d). Moreover, speed of sound in the mixtures has been evaluated using various semi-empirical relations and such values were compared with experimental speeds to verify applicability to the systems investigated.

The {{mechanism by which}} these proteins are recruited to the origin {{and the role of}} the E 1 /E 2 complex in replication remain undefined. To examine the interplay of these replication proteins, we have analyzed the binding of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 31 b E 1 and E 2 proteins to the origin of replication. Binding of E 1 to the origin was increased by E 2 proteins and required the presence of E 2 binding sites. This increase was due to the formation of E 1 /E 2 complexes which preferentially bound E 2 -responsive sequences, and the magnitude was determined by the relative affinity of the E 2 binding sites. While the E 1 protein alone bound an A/T-rich sequence at the HPV- 31 b origin with low affinity, complexes of E 1 and E 2 bound instead to E 2 binding sites with high affinity. The E 1 /E 2 complex bound a similar sequence as E 2 homodimers, but only E 2 homodimer binding induced a significant increase in hypersensitivity as indicated by DNase I footprinting. In the presence of <b>excess</b> <b>E</b> 1, E 1 proteins bound both the A/T-rich sequence and E 2 binding sites through complex formation with E 2.
