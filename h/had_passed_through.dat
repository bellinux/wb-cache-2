5|$|No.5 Elementary Flying Training School (No.5 EFTS) was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) pilot {{training}} {{unit that}} operated during World WarII. It {{was one of}} twelve elementary flying training schools employed by the RAAF to provide introductory flight instruction to new pilots as part of Australia's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme. No.5 EFTS was established in June 1940 at Narromine, New South Wales, and primarily operated Tiger Moths.

5|$|The {{first draft}} {{and part of}} the editing process was {{completed}} before Fleming's death and the manuscript <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> the hands of his copy editor, William Plomer, but it was not as polished as other Bond stories. Much of the detail contained in the previous novels was missing, as this was often added by Fleming in the second draft. Publishers Jonathan Cape passed the manuscript to Kingsley Amis for his thoughts and advice on the story, although his suggestions were not subsequently used.|$|E
5|$|Both Britain and France claimed {{victory in}} the battle: Britain by virtue of {{capturing}} or sinking seven French ships without losing any of her own and remaining {{in control of the}} battle site; France because the vital convoy <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> the Atlantic unharmed and arrived in France without significant loss. The two fleets were showered by their respective nations with both praise and criticism – the latter particularly directed at those captains not felt to have contributed significantly to the fighting. The British fleet in Spithead was treated with a Royal visit by King George III and the entire royal household.|$|E

By 01:00 on 14 May, a pontoon bridge had been erected over which Sdkz 222, SdKfz 232 and SdKfz 264 armoured cars began to dismount in the bridgeheads. French reports spoke of German tanks crossing the bridges. Such reports were in error, as the first Panzers only crossed at 07:20 on 14 May.

5|$|No.11 Elementary Flying Training School (No.11 EFTS) was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) pilot {{training}} {{unit that}} operated during World WarII. It {{was one of}} twelve elementary flying training schools employed by the RAAF to provide introductory flight instruction to new pilots as part of Australia's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme. No.11 EFTS was established in June 1941 at Benalla, Victoria, and operated Tiger Moths and Wackett Trainers during the war. It ceased training in July 1945 after almost 3,000 students <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>through,</b> and was re-formed as Care and Maintenance Unit (CMU) Benalla in February 1946. CMU Benalla was disbanded in October 1948.|$|E
5|$|The school's inaugural EATS course, {{consisting}} of twenty-four students, commenced on 29April 1940; {{all but one}} of the students graduated. Five more Tiger Moths arrived on 25June. On 22July, three aircraft belonging to the South Australian Aero Club were pressed into service, and training by the club ceased. No.1 EFTS received three CAC Wackett Trainers on 26June 1941. On 2August 1941, control of the school was transferred from Southern Area Command, which had been formed in March 1940, to the newly established No.1 (Training) Group. As of December 1942, No.1EFTS had 116 students under instruction; a total of 1,184 trainees—81 air cadets and 1,043 EATS students—had passed through the school. A year later No.1EFTS had eighty-five students under instruction and a total of 1,628 <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>through.</b>|$|E
5|$|Turbulence {{and dynamic}} {{forces in the}} {{heliosphere}} cannot affect {{the shape of the}} solar corona within, because the information can only travel at the speed of Alfvén waves. The solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere, forming the solar magnetic field into a spiral shape, until it impacts the heliopause more than 50 AU from the Sun. In December 2004, the Voyager 1 probe passed through a shock front that is thought {{to be part of the}} heliopause. In late 2012 Voyager 1 recorded a marked increase in cosmic ray collisions and a sharp drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind, which suggested that the probe <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> the heliopause and entered the interstellar medium.|$|E

5|$|In {{making his}} {{terrestrial}} globes, Molyneux examined ruttiers (instructions for directions at sea) and pilots (navigational handbooks). He {{is known to}} have given a ruttier for Brazil and the West Indies to Thomas Harriot in 1590. He also received advice and assistance from navigators and mathematicians. It is likely, for instance, that Sir Walter Raleigh advised him on a legend in Spanish about the Solomon Islands that appeared on the terrestrial globe. Raleigh came by the information from Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, a Galician explorer sent by King Philip II of Spain to fortify the Strait of Magellan after Francis Drake <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> it. In 1584, the Spaniard was Raleigh's guest in London for a few weeks, after being captured by Raleigh on a journey to Europe.|$|E
5|$|The 1804 Antigua–Charleston {{hurricane}} was {{the most}} severe hurricane in Georgia since 1752, causing over 500deaths and at least $1.6million (1804USD) in damage throughout the Southeastern United States. Originating near Antigua on 3September, it initially drifted west-northwestward, soon nearing Puerto Rico. Throughout its existence in the Caribbean Sea, the hurricane damaged, destroyed, and capsized numerous ships, and at Saint Kitts, it {{was considered to be}} the worst since 1772. By 4September, the storm arrived at the Bahamas and turned northward before approaching the coast of northern Florida on 6September. The hurricane eventually came ashore along the coastline of Georgia and South Carolina while producing mostly southeasterly winds. A severe gale was noted in New England later that month, on 11and 12September, although it was likely not the same system as that which <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> the Caribbean and southeastern United States earlier that month.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 29 June, {{the rebels}} {{attacked}} the Ustaše {{in a village}} on the Mostar–Nevesinje road. Prohaska demanded help from Mostar, and planned to send a force from Nevesinje to assist. From Mostar, a company of the 21st Battalion was despatched to relieve the Ustaše, who had managed to hold off the rebels. The Home Guard company then took over the post from the Ustaše. The same day, two new battalions arrived in Mostar, the 23rd Battalion from Osijek and the 15th Battalion from Travnik. These reinforcements arrived just as Prpić received confirmation that Avtovac had been captured by the rebels. The remaining small garrison in Gacko, consisting of only 20 gendarmes and 30 Ustaše, were holding out but expecting more attacks by the rebels. In the morning, the attack by elements of the 10th Battalion stalled until the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Julije Reš, personally took command of the operation, {{clearing the way for}} the Italians. The promised Italian intervention commenced about midday, and about 100 trucks of Italian soldiers arrived in Gacko about 17:00. As they <b>had</b> <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> Avtovac, the rebels had left the town and withdrawn to villages to the east. About 18:00, the 10th Battalion relieved the besieged gendarmes in the village schoolhouse. ZNDH aircraft from Mostar airfield flew reconnaissance sorties over the area and dropped leaflets over Stolac, Stepen, Avtovac, Gacko and Plužine.|$|E
