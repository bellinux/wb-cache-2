25|$|In 2011 three <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> support {{structures}} were installed.|$|E
25|$|A <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> is an {{offshore}} wind turbine mounted on a floating structure that allows the turbine to generate electricity in water depths where bottom-mounted towers are not feasible.|$|E
25|$|Hywind is the world's first {{full-scale}} <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine,</b> {{installed in}} the North Sea off Norway in 2009. Other kinds of floating turbines have been deployed, and more projects are planned.|$|E
25|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> {{are being}} {{developed}} for deeper water.|$|R
40|$|As {{offshore}} <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> {{are installed}} in deeper water, in-terest {{is growing in}} <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> because, among other reasons, they may become cheaper than fixed-bottom turbines at greater depths. When analysing <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines,</b> linear diffraction theory is commonly used to model the hydrodynamic loads on the platform. While it well known that slow drift mo-tion due to second-order loads can be important for other float-ing offshore platforms, {{it has not yet}} been established how im-portant such effects are for <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> In this pa-per we aim to give a general result by developing approximate closed-form expressions to estimate the second-order slow drift motion of platforms of different sizes. The values are bench-marked against a typical calculation of the slow-drift response of a platform. The results show that <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines,</b> which tend to have smaller dimensions than other floating structures, may be expected to show smaller slow-drift motions...|$|R
40|$|The {{safety and}} {{reliability}} margin of offshore <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> {{need to be}} higher than that of onshore <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> due to larger environmental loads and higher operational and maintenance costs for offshore <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> compared to onshore <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> However rotor cyclic loads coupled with 6 DOFs motions of the substructure, amplifies the fatigue damage in offshore <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> In general a lower fatigue design factor is used for offshore <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> compared to that of the stationary oil and gas platforms. This is because the consequence of a failure in offshore <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> in general is lower than that of the offshore oil and gas platforms. In offshore <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> a sub-system fault in the electrical system and blade pitch angle controller also induces additional fatigue loading on the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> structure...|$|R
25|$|As {{they are}} {{suitable}} for towing, <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> units can be relocated to any location on the sea without much additional cost. So {{they can be used}} as prototype test units to practically assess the design adequacy and wind power potential of prospective sites.|$|E
25|$|When {{oil fields}} become depleted, the {{operator}} injects water to keep pressure high for further extraction. This requires power, but installing gas turbines means {{shutting down the}} extraction process, losing valuable income. The classification society DNV GL has calculated {{that in some cases}} a <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> can economically provide power for injection, as the oil platform can keep on producing, avoiding a costly pause.|$|E
25|$|The {{technical}} feasibility of deepwater floating wind turbines is not questioned, as the long-term survivability of floating structures {{has been successfully}} demonstrated by the marine and offshore oil industries over many decades. However, the economics that allowed the deployment of thousands of offshore oil rigs {{have yet to be}} demonstrated for <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> platforms. For deepwater wind turbines, a floating structure will replace pile-driven monopoles or conventional concrete bases that are commonly used as foundations for shallow water and land-based turbines. The floating structure must provide enough buoyancy to support the weight of the turbine and to restrain pitch, roll and heave motions within acceptable limits. The capital costs for the wind turbine itself will not be significantly higher than current marine-proofed turbine costs in shallow water. Therefore, the economics of deepwater wind turbines will be determined primarily by the additional costs of the floating structure and power distribution system, which are offset by higher offshore winds and close proximity to large load centres (e.g. shorter transmission runs).|$|E
25|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>wind</b> {{parks are}} wind farms that site several <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> closely {{together}} {{to take advantage}} of common infrastructure such as power transmission facilities.|$|R
25|$|The cost is {{expected}} to be in the range of 10–20billion Yen over five years to build the first six <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b>|$|R

This topical paper reviews the main developments and research avenues currently under way, focusing on recent research literature. It addresses specific challenges of <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> and introduces key issues focused on the floating platform. In addition, recommendations for further research are introduced...|$|R
25|$|Ideol’s {{engineers}} have developed and patented a ring-shaped floating foundation {{based on a}} central opening system (Damping Pool) used for optimizing foundation + wind turbine stability. As such, the sloshing water contained in this central opening counteracts the swell-induced floater oscillations. Foundation-fastened mooring lines are simply attached to the seabed to hold the assembly in position. This floating foundation is compatible with all wind turbines without any modification and has reduced dimensions (from 36 to 55 metres per side for a wind turbine between 2 and 8 MW). Manufacturable in concrete or steel, this floating foundation allows for local construction near project sites. Ideol leads the FLOATGEN project, a <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> demonstration project based on Ideol’s technology and planned to be built by Bouygues Travaux Publics and installed by mid-2017 {{off the coast of}} Le Croisic on the offshore experimentation site of Ecole Centrale de Nantes (SEM-REV). The construction of this project, France's first offshore wind turbine (precisely 2 MW), is already underway since 1 June 2016.|$|E
25|$|Floating wind {{turbines}} {{can be used}} to provide motive power for achieving artificial upwelling of nutrient-rich deep ocean water to the surface for enhancing fisheries growth in areas with tropical and temperate weather. Though deep seawater (below 50 metres depth) is rich in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, the phytoplankton growth is poor due to the absence of sunlight. The most productive ocean fishing grounds are located in cold water seas at high latitudes where natural upwelling of deep sea water occurs due to inverse thermocline temperatures. The electricity generated by the <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> would be used to drive high–flow and low–head water pumps to draw cold water from below 50 meters water depth and mixed with warm surface water by eductors before releasing into the sea. Mediterranean sea, Black sea, Caspian sea, Red sea, Persian gulf, deep water lakes/reservoirs are suitable for artificial upwelling for enhancing fish catch economically. These units can also be mobile type to utilise the seasonal favourable winds all around the year.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a new {{tool for the}} optimization of catenary mooring systems for <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> with a semi-submersible support structure. Each source of environmental loading -wind, current and waves -is spread over a range of compass directions, based upon probability distributions determined by meteorological and oceanographic measurements. Frequency domain analysis is applied to determine the linear response of the platform. Mean forces due to wind and current are determined to ﬁnd the mean position of the platform and thereby the linearized mooring stiffness matrix. Subsequently, the stochastic loads from wind sea, ocean swell and turbulent wind are applied {{in the form of}} spectral loading matrices. The resulting mooring system design is site-speciﬁc, accounting for the directionality of environmental loads. A large number of different scenarios can be evaluated quickly and approximately. Hence the tool is useful for preliminary design of <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> As an example application, a symmetric semi-submersible design with three columns is analyzed. Results for two sites in the North Sea, with different water depths and distinct directionality of environmental loads, are compared and indicate that spectral wind loads should be considered when designing mooring systems for <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractSlow drift is a large, low-frequency {{motion of}} a {{floating}} platform caused by nonlinear hydrodynamic forces. Although slow drift {{is a well-known}} phenomenon for ships and other floating structures, new platforms for <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are significantly smaller in scale, and it {{is yet to be}} established how important slow drift is for them. In this paper we derive an approximate expression for the scaling of the slow drift motion with platform size, mooring characteristics and wave conditions. This suggests that slow drift may be less important for <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> than other, larger, floating structures. The accuracy of the approximations is discussed; in the one case where detailed data is available, the approximate result is found to be conservative by a factor of up to 40...|$|R

40|$|Offshore {{winds are}} {{generally}} {{stronger and more}} consistent than winds on land, making the offshore environment attractive for wind energy development. A {{large part of the}} offshore wind resource is however located in deep water, where floating turbines are the only economical way of harvesting the energy. The design of offshore <b>floating</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> relies on the use of modeling tools that can simulate the entire coupled system behavior.
