30|$|Equation  6 is deduced {{under the}} {{assumptions}} that {{the geometry of}} the resonance cavity is significantly less than the acoustic wavelength. It was also assumed that the wave motion and mass distribution conditions in the <b>connection</b> <b>tube</b> and the resonant cavity can be ignored. These hypotheses are hard to meet if the ratios of height and width are too large or too small. In addition, when the ratios of height and width become too small, the transverse wave is dominant in the resonant cavity, and the intersection area of the cavity and connecting tube becomes larger. This leads to strong three-dimensional effects in the intersection area and therefore reduces {{the accuracy of the}} calculation.|$|R
40|$|Knee joints, {{the beam}} column {{connections}} {{found at the}} roof level of a moment resisting frame buildings, are inherently different from conventional interior and exterior beam column connections {{in the way that}} forces from adjoining members are transferred into joint and then resisted by the joint. A <b>knee</b> <b>connection</b> has two distinct load resisting mechanisms, each for closing and opening actions acting simultaneously under reversed cyclic loading. In spite of many distinct differences in the behaviour of shear resistance in knee joints, there are no special design provisions in the major design codes available across the world due to lack of in-depth research on the <b>knee</b> <b>connections.</b> To understand the relative importance of opening and closing actions in design, it is imperative to study knee joints under varying shear stresses, especially at higher opening-to-closing shear stress ratios. Three knee joint specimens, under different input shear stresses, were designed to produce a varying ratio of input opening to closing shear stresses. The design was carried out {{in such a way that}} the ratio of flexural strength of beams with consideration of axial forces in opening to closing actions are maintained at 0. 5, 0. 7, and 1. 0, thereby resulting in the required variation of opening to closing joint shear stress ratios among the specimens. The behaviour of these specimens was then carefully studied in terms of closing and opening capacities, hysteretic behaviour, and envelope curves to understand the differences in joint performance based on which an attempt to suggest design guidelines for knee joints is made emphasizing the relative importance of opening and closing actions. Specimens with relatively higher opening stresses were observed to be more vulnerable under the action of seismic loading...|$|R

The RHS tested were cold-formed Grade C 350 and Grade C 450 specimens. The connection details and welding procedures are discussed. The rotation capacity of the connections for use in plastic design is examined. It was found that in tension (opening moment), there was often fracture in the heat affected zone of the RHS at low rotation values, whilst in compression (closing moment), web buckling occurred adjacent to the connection. The unstiffened connections were incapable of reaching the plastic moment. There was variability in the rotation capacity of the stiffened connections in tension, and so they were considered unsuitable for plastic hinge formation since the behaviour could not be guaranteed. For compression, only Grade C 350, and not the Grade C 450 joints, demonstrated rotation capacity suitable for use in plastic design...|$|R
40|$|A {{recently}} developed numerical model, describing a self amplification and structure formation process {{which is used}} to model the initial nonlinear growth phase of edge localized modes (ELMs), is applied to the JET tokamak. Connection length simulations of the magnetic topology, including only error fields, for JET reveal the existence of small, so called short <b>connection</b> length flux <b>tubes.</b> Such a configuration is used as starting point for the model. Thermoelectric currents are assumed to flow in the short <b>connection</b> length flux <b>tubes</b> and add additional magnetic perturbations which change the magnetic topology severely. The change in magnetic topology leads to the formation of new, much larger short <b>connection</b> length flux <b>tubes</b> that can conduct much larger currents through the plasma edge. The current density inside the flux tubes is assumed to be constant to calculate the total current. This self amplification process leads to the formation of patterns, known as footprints, on various segments of the inner wall throughout the vessel. The resulting footprints are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Literature {{results show}} that the {{pressure}} piling phenomenon {{is the result of the}} combination of: (1) the precompression effect arising from the jet flow from the ignition vessel); (2) the turbulence induced by the fast flame propagation (jet ignition) in the secondary vessel; and (3) the vent flowing toward the ignition vessel, which mitigates the peak pressure. To control the severity of the explosion in the second vessel it is possible to either limit precompression or to reduce the characteristic ratio between the "reaction" and "venting" times. A mathematical model of the pressure piling phenomenon is proposed herein to study the possibility of reducing the peak pressure in the second vessel by limiting the turbulence level induced and thus increasing the reaction time with respect to the venting time. More precisely, the effect of geometry obtained by using divergent <b>connection</b> <b>tubes</b> from the ignition vessel to the second vessel and by varying the volume ratio between the two vessels has been evaluated, demonstrating that small modifications in the design will prevent the catastrophic behavior of pressure piling. © 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers...|$|R

Inspiration through contaminated equipment is a potential source of cross infection. To investigate bacteria mobilization (ie, bacteria detachment and aerosolization from the instrument) during routine spirometric testing, 2 types of flowbased spirometers were used. Bacteria mobilization during artificial inspiration through in-line filters or cardboard mouthpieces was evaluated. Methods: Nine hundred workers undergoing periodic spirometric testing were enrolled at the occupational physician office in 30 sessions of 30 subjects each. The {{participants were asked to}} perform a forced vital capacity test in a turbine-type spirometer and in an unheated pneumotachograph fitted with disposable in-line filters or cardboard mouthpieces. To evaluate bacterial mobilization, an artificial inspiration was performed and bacterial growth determined. The bacterial growth analysis was assessed after the first and the thirtieth spirometric tests of each session without disinfecting the instruments between tests. In addition, instrument bacterial contamination was evaluated. Results: No significant bacterial mobilization and instrument contamination were found in spirometric tests executed with in-line filters. Conversely, a significant bacterial mobilization and instrument contamination were observed in tests performed with cardboard mouthpieces. Differences between the 2 spirometers were not significant. Conclusion: In-line filters may effectively reduce the risk of bacterial cross infection. Inspiration through flow-based spirometers fitted with disposable cardboard mouthpieces is completely safe when combined with spirometer disinfection/sterilization between subjects...|$|R
40|$|Carbon (BDOC) in a Continuous The {{biodegradability}} of glucose {{under different}} conditions has been chosen to evaluate and, {{based on the}} results, develop a continuous plug flow bioreactor for biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) on-line measurements, {{as well as to}} find out what the continuous plug flow bioreactor really measures in terms of BDOC. Plug flow biofilm reactors were colonised by microorganisms indigenous to streamwater and lakewater. Seven different kinds of experiments have been performed, namely experiments with sand-filtered raw water to test the columns, long-term experiments with glucose solution, concentration experiments with glucose solution, hydrodynamic experiments with methylene blue and three different kinds of recirculation experiments with glucose solution. The hydrodynamic experiments demonstrated a retention time of 50 hours or longer for organic molecules in the size range of 200 - 300 A. This fact proves that the continuous plug flow bioreactor in the case of BDOC on-line measurements only measures an average effect and provides doubtful values for BDOC. Optimisation of retention time by optimising the pore size considering the surface area has been proposed to develop the method. A semi-batch and a trickling bioreactor have been suggested as alternative kinds of reactors for BDOC on-line measurements. Other measurement results have been influenced by the error caused by the wrong retention time or by another error which occurred due to the leakage of organic carbon from <b>connection</b> <b>tubes</b> (Vi ton). ...|$|R

The experiment was conducted in microcosms consisting of an inoculation plate, <b>connection</b> <b>tube,</b> and dispersal plate. Results show species-specific dispersal abilities with Pm I dispersing almost one week later than Pm III. The number of dispersive adults at time of first dispersal was species-specific, with one dispersive female in Pm I and Pm III and a higher, gender-balanced, number in Pm II and Pm IV. Food distribution affected dispersal: in absence of food in the inoculation plate, all species dispersed after ca four days. When food was available Pm I dispersed later, {{and at the same time}} and densities irrespective of food conditions in the dispersal plate (food vs no food), suggesting density-dependent dispersal. Pm III dispersed faster and at a lower population density. Salinity affected dispersal, with slower dispersal at higher salinity.
