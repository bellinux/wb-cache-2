Methods Histopathologic variables in 114 consecutively resected periampullary adenocarcinomas of pancreatobiliary (n = 67) and intestinal (n = 47) type differentiation were evaluated using a standardized, systematic protocol for evaluation of the resected specimen (study group).

The results of crude Odds Ratios analyses indicated that wearing a veil was associated with a high risk of osteoporosis: OR 2. 29 (95 % CI, 1. 38 – 3. 82). Multiparity or a history of familial peripheral osteoporotic fractures had also a significant effect on increasing the osteoporosis risk (ORs: 1. 87 (95 % CI, 1. 05 – 3. 49) and 2. 01 (95 % CI, 1. 20 – 3. 38)).

In carotid sinus hypersensitivity, external triggers cause sudden reductions in blood pressure, leading to dizziness or syncope, resulting in falls.

However, direct evidence for this is lacking. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of head turning in elderly with carotid sinus hypersensitivity. We performed a prospective, observational study in 105 elderly patients who visited a geriatric falls clinic in a university teaching hospital and in 25 community dwelling healthy elderly subjects.

5000|$|... “Fragilina” in Italian means “the little {{delicate}} one.” Fragilina {{is part of}} {{a series}} of female nudes that Attilio sculpted, beginning with “A Soul” in 1909. The woman in Fragilina is almost identical in pose to the woman in “A Soul.” Though, in Fragilina, more marble is cut away to leave a freer, fluid, and abstract work. Going with the theme of the work being abstract, many art critics the oval shaped <b>head</b> gives less <b>definition</b> of the hair and face. Some say, “the eyes appear almost veiled in stone.” When discussing Fragilina, Piccirilli said, “Every person has his own ideal of beauty stored away in his subconscious mind. When facial characteristics are precisely delineated, the observer is denied the opportunity of personally visualizing his ideal type. This reaction frequently takes place without full realization.” [...] So, as can be seen with Fragilina and his subsequent works, it can be said he was a minimalist. Piccirilli was described impeccably in the book, Attilio Piccirilli: Life of an American Sculptor, by Josef Vincent Lombardo. Lombardo writes, “Piccirilli’s art stands out boldly for its discipline, simplicity, and dignity.... His sculpture was and is simply tailored, free from adventitious detail and superficiality... Piccirilli’s style is distinctly personal and highly selective. Simplicity is his gospel, restraint his creed.” Fragilina was part of an exhibit at the National Sculpture Society in New York in 1923. It was also exhibited at the National Academy of Design commemorative exhibition in 1925. Piccirilli also made smaller versions of Fragilina, including two bronze casts. One of which is at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.|$|R
30|$|An {{exemplary}} {{use case}} {{is described in}} the following. The motivation is to enhance the user experience of an extremely high density of active users and machines {{in an area where}} normally the mobile access network nodes are sparsely deployed. The challenge is then to fulfill the requirements of such a massive connectivity of a mixture of eMBB and MMC devices for a certain time period by the network that is highly under-dimensioned for such a use case. Within the framework of the envisioned flexible architecture, service flow management determines that there is an over-flow of mixture of services to be provisioned to massive number of devices and triggers the Function Coordinator regarding this situation. The Function Coordinator (here 5 G Orchestrator) in turn updates the service chain to handle these requirements. One solution to tackle the signaling congestion is to perform clustering mechanisms where a cluster head coordinates the scheduling of a group of devices. In this regard, Function Coordinator (here VNF Manager) commands the Function Agents of the selected cluster heads (selection can be performed by the Context Management Entity according to the collected context, e.g., device capabilities reported by Function Agents) in the target region to install the cluster-head functionality in the BBEs of those selected cluster <b>heads.</b> The functionality <b>definition</b> is taken from the Radio Processing Function Pool via Function Coordinator (here 5 G Orchestrator) and Function Agents. It is worth noting that the cluster head functionality is only utilized for a given time period when the service is required. Due to limited machine capabilities, e.g., small memory, such cluster head functionality, may be removed depending on the service and energy efficiency requirements. Based on the input from Function Coordinator (here 5 G Orchestrator), the WSDN Controller can now perform the re-routing of the data flows according to service chain in line with the updated network topology.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Well-designed {{clinical}} {{studies on the}} palatal development in preterm and low birthweight infants are desirable because the literature is characterized by contradictory results. It could be shown that knowledge about 'normal' palatal development is still weak as well (Part 1). The objective of this review is therefore to contribute a fundamental analysis of methodologies, confounding factors, and outcomes of studies on palatal development in preterm and low birthweight infants. Methods An electronic literature search as well as hand searches were performed based on Cochrane search strategies including sources {{of more than a}} century in English, German, and French. Original data were recalculated from studies which primarily dealt with both preterm and term infants. The extracted data, especially those from non-English paper sources, were provided unfiltered for comparison. Results Seventy-eight out of 155 included articles were analyzed for palatal morphology of preterm infants. Intubation, feeding tubes, feeding mode, tube characteristics, restriction of oral functions, kind of diet, cranial form and birthweight were seen as causes contributing to altered palatal morphology. Changes associated with intubation concern length, depth, width, asymmetry, crossbite, and contour of the palate. The phenomenon 'grooving' has also been described as a complication associated with oral intubation. However, this phenomenon suffers from lack of a clear-cut <b>definition.</b> <b>Head</b> flattening, pressure from the oral tube, pathologic or impaired tongue function, and broadening of the alveolar ridges adjacent to the tube have been raised as causes of 'grooving'. Metrically, the palates of intubated preterm infants remain narrower, which has been examined up to the age of the late mixed dentition. Conclusion There is no evidence that would justify the exclusion of any of the raised causes contributing to palatal alteration. Thus, early orthodontic and logopedic control of formerly orally intubated preterm infants is recommended, as opposed to non-intubated infants. From the orthodontic point of view, nasal intubation should be favored. The role that palatal protection plates and pressure-dispersing pads for the head have in palatal development remains unclear. </p...|$|R

During the study period, we detected an annual average incidence of 34. 4 cases per 100, 000 children aged &#x 003 C; 2 years (95 % CI 25. 1, 46. 1) and a case fatality proportion of 22 % (10 / 45). Among the AHT cases, 82 % were infants. Significant differences (p &#x 003 C; 0. 05) in AHT were noted by age and race, but not by sex. Conclusions. In Alaska, applying the CDC PAHT definition to the multi-source database enabled us to capture 49 % more AHT cases than any of the individual database used in this analysis alone...|$|R

Among the key objectives used to achieve this mission is working with national and international partners to monitor health and detect and investigate health problems. Monitoring of population health is achieved through public health surveillance, defined as the ongoing and systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of outcome-specific data {{for use in the}} planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice (Thacker and Berkelman 1988). Public health surveillance relies on uniform case definitions and data elements that facilitate the collection of data useful for monitoring trends over time and characterizing persons at risk for health outcomes of interest among different subpopulations or geographic areas. The prevention of child maltreatment and the reduction of abusive injuries and their consequences is an important priority area for CDC. As part of the public health approach in addressing child maltreatment, CDC has launched an effort to develop uniform case definitions and data elements for use in surveillance of child maltreatment and abusive head trauma. In 2008, CDC published Version 1. 0 of Child Maltreatment Surveillance: Uniform Definitions for Public Health and Recommended Data Elements (Leeb et al. 2008), which covers all types of child maltreatment. The current report focuses on standard data elements for abusive head trauma 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 da specific category of child maltreatment that presents unique definitional and measurement challenges. These challenges are discussed followed by a presentation of recommended uniform operational definitions of fatal and nonfatal abusive head trauma based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 9 -CM for morbidity coding and ICD- 10 for mortality coding) diagnosis and external- cause-of-injury codes (2001; 2005). Similar processes and formats to that of the Child Maltreatment Surveillance Uniform Definitions and Data Elements have been used in order to maintain consistency and facilitate ease of use.

40|$|Global {{climate models}} {{are the only}} {{available}} comprehensive tools for studying the affects of climate change on our earth in terms of changes in different meteorological and hydrological variables in future. Precipitation and temperature {{are two of the}} most important meteorological variables with regards to their affects on other meteorological (e. g. humidity, evaporation etc.) and hydrological (e. g. river runoff) variables and on human life (e. g. food fibre production, economy etc.). Among other important local and large scale phenomenon that affects the occurrence and amount of precipitation (and severity of temperature), geographical and topographical conditions perhaps play most important role in the behaviour of these variables in certain area. This makes the two variables more or less local phenomenons that need to be specifically studied for each area of interest individually. Unfortunately the scale at which global climate models (GCMs) operate is too large for any meaningful study to be performed related to future patterns of these two variables on local scale. Different methodologies have thus been developed to downscale (i. e. to increase the resolution of) GCM data to the local scale. The two broad categories of downscaling methodologies are statistical and dynamical downscaling. In statistical downscaling methodology, an attempt is made to develop a relationship between large scale GCM modelled variable (called predictor) and local scale observed/measured variable (called predictant). Assuming that in future this relationship will hold, the relationship is used to predict local scale predictand for future simulated scenarios of predictor. In dynamical downscaling (the so called regional climate models (RCMs)) on the other hand, an attempt is made to embed a complete physical model of {{more or less the same}} complexity as GCM, in a GCM and upon receiving values from GCM at its boundaries, recalculate all possible physical formulations at a much finer scale. The local conditions are thus taken in to account and the results are believed to be more suitable for local scale studies. Both downscaling methodologies have been extensively applied in climate change and impact studies around the world with varying degree of success and new techniques are consistently being developed to improve upon them. Both methodologies have associated advantages and disadvantages. While statistical downscaling is computationally much cheaper than RCMs, statistical downscaling is based on basic assumption of stationarity which is sometimes hard to justify. RCMs on the other hand although attempt to solve physical equations at local scale, does also inherit bias from the parent GCM. This thesis presents statistical downscaling methodology which attempts to correct for the biases that are inherited by different RCMs. Three different RCMs are considered for German part of Rhine basin and using bias correction methodology based on correction of quantiles of precipitation (and temperature for some studies), new scenarios of precipitation are developed. Further, a distributed version of conceptual hydrological model HBV is calibrated and validated for German part of Rhine basin and raw and downscaled RCM scenarios of precipitation are fed into the model to ascertain the future hydrological regime in face of climate change for this important river. The downscaling procedure briefly discussed above was applied in two ways. In the first case the statistical downscaling methodology was performed on RCM data without considering any constraint during quantile-quantile exchange between RCM control and scenario runs. In the second case, the quantile-quantile exchange was conditioned on occurrence of certain circulation pattern. It was briefly discussed above how precipitation (occurrence and amount) is conditioned by certain phenomenon. In addition to geographical and topographical location, precipitation also depends upon large scale circulation patterns. Thus it was assumed that conditioning the downscaling methodology also on circulation patterns would bring about better results. To realize above concept, classification of circulation patterns is performed. Fuzzy rule based classification methodology is used to classify circulation patterns. Two new methodologies of classification of circulation patterns are presented in this thesis. One is based on low flow conditions in rivers in the study area and the other is based on clustering of precipitation stations. The new classification methodology is believed to provide better classification of circulation patterns in that the difference between the individual classes is enhanced and similarity among the same class intensified. A classification analysis measure called wetness index was developed and used to identify critical circulation patterns among the classified circulation patterns. Critical circulation patterns were identified for extreme wet and dry conditions and it was shown that all extreme cases of floods and droughts are caused by identified critical CPs. This thesis also presents and applies another statistical downscaling methodology based on multivariate autoregressive model of order 1 (one). The methodology makes use of the classification of circulation patterns described above. The parameters of the autoregressive model depend upon the circulation patterns. The methodology is used for number of head catchments in southern and eastern Germany. <b>Head</b> catchments by <b>definition</b> have very quick response time to any significant precipitation event. They contribute quickly to the surface runoff and if they are head catchments of larger rivers, may also result in bigger flood events. Downscaling of precipitation was performed for these catchments by using mean sea level pressure (MSLP) as predictor and local station precipitation as predictant. The model was developed such that ensemble of daily precipitation could be produced. Thereby enabling one to estimate associated uncertainty. Finally drought analysis are performed for German part of Rhine basin using Palmer drought severity index. A FORTRAN routine is developed which can calculate different kind of drought indices such as Palmer drought severity index, Palmer hydrological drought index, and monthly moisture anomaly index for certain catchment. The program developed is also capable of simultaneously mapping the results. The mapping of results makes it possible to ascertain the severity of drought over the larger area. The analysis of drought is performed for observational gridded data set and for control and A 1 B scenarios of three different RCMs. Globale Klimamodelle sind das einzige Werkzeug, um die Effekte des globalen Klimawandels in Bezug auf quantitative Veränderungen in den unterschiedlichen meteorologischen und hydrologischen Variablen abzuschätzen. Niederschlag und Temperatur sind dabei zwei der wichtigsten Größen, da sie andere meteorologische Variablen, (wie z. B. die Luftfeuchtigkeit oder die Verdunstung), hydrologische Variablen (wie z. B. den Oberflächenabfluss) und ganz direkt die Lebensbedingungen des Menschen (z. B. die Nahrungsmittelproduktion) stark beeinflussen. Unter den weiteren großräumigen und lokalen Bedingungen, die das Auftreten von Niederschlag und die Niederschlagsmenge bestimmen, spielen die geographischen und topographischen Gegebenheiten die wahrscheinlich wichtigste Rolle. Darum müssen diese Größen, für jedes einzelne Zielgebiet einer Klimawandelabschätzung lokal analysiert werden. Unglücklicherweise ist die Skala, auf der die globalen Klimamodelle (engl. ''Global Circulation Models'' - kurz: ''GCM'') arbeiten, zu groß für sinnvolle Untersuchungen zukünftiger Niederschlag- und Temperaturverhältnisse auf lokalem Maßstab. Deshalb wurden andere Methoden entwickelt, um die Nützlichkeit und die Auflösung der GCM-Daten auf lokaler Ebene zu erhöhen (sog. ''Downscaling''). Als eine grobe Einteilung der Dowscaling-Methoden spricht man von statistischem und dynamischem Downscaling. Beim statistischen Downscaling wird versucht, eine Beziehung zwischen den großskalig simulierten Variablen aus den GCMs (Prädiktoren) und beobachteten lokalen Messwerten (Prädiktanten) zu etablieren. Unter der Annahme, dass diese Beziehung in der Zukunft konstant bleiben wird, kann sie dazu genutzt werden, die zukünftigen lokalen Werte der Prädiktanten aus den simulierten Zukunftszenarien der Prädiktoren vorherzusagen. Der Ansatz des dynamischen Downscaling mittels regionaler Klimamodelle (engl. ''Regional Circulation Models'' - kurz: ''RCM'') besteht darin, eine physikalisches Model mit mehr oder weniger der gleichen Komplexität wie das GCM in dieses einzubetten. Das RCM erhält seine Eingabewerte als Randbedingungen aus dem GCM und berechnet die vorliegenden physikalischen Gleichungen erneut auf einer deutlich feineren Skala. Damit können die lokalen Einflussfaktoren berücksichtigt werden. Es angenommen, dass die Ergebnisse somit besser für Untersuchungen im lokalen Maßstab geeignet sind. Beide Downscaling-Methoden werden weltweit vielfältig in Klimawandel-Studien und Klimafolgekosten-Analysen eingesetzt. Die Güte der Ergebnisse ist sehr unterschiedlich und es werden ständig neue Techniken entwickelt, um diese zu verbessern. Beide Methoden haben ihre typischen Vor- und Nachteile. Satistische Downscaling Methoden sind weit weniger rechenintensiv. Allerdings basieren sie auf der Annahme, dass der Zusammenhang zwischen globalen und lokalen Variablen konstant ist, was in manchen Fällen schwer zu rechtfertigen ist. RCMs auf der anderen Seite können zwar die physikalischen Gleichungen auf einem lokalen Maßstab lösen, erben aber über die Randbedingungen die Modelfehler aus dem antreibenden GCMs. In dieser Arbeit wird eine statistische Downscaling Methode vorgestellt, die versucht, die aus dem GCM geerbten Modellfehler zu korrigieren. Es werden drei RCMs für den deutschen Teil des Reineinzugsgebiets betrachtet. Die Methode basiert auf einer Korrektur der Quantile der Verteilung der Niederschlagswerte (in einigen Untersuchungen auch der Temperatur). Nach der Korrektur werden Szenarios des zukünftigen Niederschlags entwickelt. Darüber hinaus wird eine räumlich detaillierte Version des konzeptionellen hydrologischen Models HBV für den deutschen Teil des Rheineinzugsgebiets kalibriert und mit den rohen sowie den korrigierten Zukunftsdaten beschickt. Damit soll eine sinnvolle Prognose des hydrologischen Regimes dieses wichtigen europäischen Stroms ermöglicht werden. Die im letzten Abschnitt erwähnte Downscaling-Methode wurde auf zwei verschiedene Weisen implementiert. Im ersten Fall wurde die Methode auf die RCM Daten angewandt, ohne irgendwelche Einschränkungen in der Quantil-Quantil Transformation zwischen den Kontroll- und den Szenarioläufen für die Zukunft zu berücksichtigen. Im zweiten Fall wurde die Quantil-Quantil-Transformation auf das Auftreten bestimmter großräumiger Wetterlagen (engl. ''Ciruclation Patterns'', kurz: CPs) konditioniert. In einem vorherigen Abschnitt wurde kurz diskutiert, wie Niederschlag in seiner Häufigkeit und Menge von verschiedenen Phänomenen beeinflusst wird. Neben den geographischen und topographischen Verhältnissen am Erhebungsort spielen dabei auch die großskaligen atmosphärischen Strömungsverhältnisse eine Rolle. Es wird somit angenommen, dass die Konditionierung der Downscaling-Methode auf die Wetterlage bessere Ergebnisse bringen könnte. Um das oben skizzierte Konzept zu verwirklichen, wurde eine Klassifizierung der Wetterlagen durchgeführt. Die Klassifizierung basiert auf einem Fuzzy-Logik Regelsystem. In dieser Arbeit werden zwei neuartige Fuzzy-Logik Klassifizierungsmethoden vorgestellt: Die erste Methode basiert auf den Niedrigwasser-Abflussverhältnissen der Flüsse im Untersuchungsgebiets, die andere auf einem Clustering von Niederschlagsmessstationen. Die neue Klassifizierungsmethode scheint eine bessere Klassifizierung der Wetterlagen zu liefern, gemessen daran, dass der Unterschied zwischen den einzelnen Klassen ausgeprägter ist und Ähnlichkeit der Mitglieder einer Klasse erhöht. Um die Klassifikation zu prüfen, wurde ein Gütemaß namens ''Wetness Index'' entwickelt. Der Wetness-Index wurde dazu verwendet, besonders kritische Wetterlagen, die also für extrem nasse oder extrem trockene Verhältnisse verantwortlich sind, zu identifizieren. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass alle extremen Fälle von Hochwasser oder Trockenheit auf die gleichen, kritischen CPs zurückgeführt werden können. In dieser Arbeit wird darüber hinaus eine weitere statistische Downscaling Methode vorgestellt, die auf einem multivariaten, autoregressiven Model erster Ordnung basiert. Diese Methode verwendet die Informationen der im letzten Abschnitt beschrieben Wetterlagenklassifikation. Die Parameter des autoregressiven Modells werden dabei CP abhängig gewählt. Die Methodik wird auf eine Reihe von Oberstrom-Einzugsgebieten in Süd- und Ostdeutschland angewendet. Oberstrom-Einzugsgebiete haben per Definition eine sehr kurze Reaktionszeit auf signifikante Regenereignisse. Sie tragen sehr schnell zum Oberflächenabfluss bei und wenn sie Teil des Einzugsgebiets eines großen Flusses sind, können sie auch größere Hochwasserereignisse auslösen. Das Niederschlags-Downscaling für diese Einzugsgebiete wurde mit dem mittleren Luftdruck auf Meereshöhe als Prädiktor und der Niederschlagshöhe an einer lokalen Messstation als Prädiktant durchgeführt. Das Model wurde so aufgesetzt, dass ein Ensemble der täglichen Niederschlagshöhe erzeugt werden kann. Dadurch wird es möglich, die Unsicherheit der Methode mit abzuschätzen. Letztlich wurde noch eine Untersuchung bezüglich Dürreperioden im deutschen Teil des Rheineinzugsgebietes durchgeführt. Dazu wurde der Palmer Dürre Index verwendet. Es wurde ein FORTRAN-Programm entwickelt, welches verschiedene Dürre Indices wie den Palmer Dürre Index, den hydrologischen Palmer Dürre Index und den monatlichen Feuchteanomalie Index für ein bestimmtes Einzugsgebiet berechnen kann. Das Programm vermag die berechneten Ergebnisse gleichzeitig in einer Karte darzustellen. Die Kartendarstellung ermöglicht es, die Schwere einer Dürre auch für ein größeres Gebiet abzuschätzen. Die Analyse von Dürreperioden wurde für gerasterte Beobachtungsdaten sowie für Daten aus den Kontroll- und A 1 B-Szenarioläufen dreier RCMs durchgeführt...|$|R
