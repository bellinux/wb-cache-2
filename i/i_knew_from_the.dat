2500|$|Principal {{photography}} started mid-October 2011, {{and took}} place at Joss Whedon's residence in Santa Monica, California. On the choice of location, he told Studio 360, [...] "First of all, my wife built that house. And <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> moment I set foot in it that I would want to film something there. Because it's all in one place, that place informs the mood and the feeling and {{the look of the}} picture so much, and I was really already comfortable with that". Whedon and his wife, Kai Cole, produced the film through their studio Bellwether Pictures. It was filmed entirely in a black-and-white palette over a period of 12 days, in conjunction with cinematographer Jay Hunter. Whedon shot it while on a contractual vacation from the post-production of The Avengers. The cast and crew were informed to keep the project a secret until production was finished. They wrapped their last day of filming on October 23, 2011.|$|E

6000|$|... 'May I go on?' he said. 'May I dare to {{tell you}} what you are to me? <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> moment we met, that you were what I had dreamt of--different, but better.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{asked me}} about Geoffrey. He {{has no reason to}} be ashamed of his record in Canada," [...] she said. [...] "I will tell you what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> beginning--and <b>I</b> hope I shall tell it well." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I hope, Cuitcatl, {{that when}} the {{resistance}} is over--as it must be before long, for <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> talk of the guards that famine is among you, and that hundreds are dying daily--I hope that I {{may be able to}} aid you, as you are aiding me." ...|$|R

60|$|Again {{the head}} of the Quakers' {{formidable}} list was up. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> way that Cogswell paced the coaching box that the word had gone out to look the Rube over seriously. There were possibilities even in rubes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So? I {{think the}} better of thee. Thy teachings are good. Thou hast turned one man that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> path of strife.' He laughed immensely.

6000|$|... "'Look here, you long-eared old hopper, you! Stop {{kicking up}} so much dust, or I'll chew you into shoe-strings when I get at you!' he cried, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sounds {{that he was trying}} to wipe the dirt from his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Bless me, ma, I {{was only}} in fun. I could tell you ever so many stories like that. There's Broughton's, on the table there. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first it was an impostor, and the old nurse dressed like a nun was his mother.' ...|$|E

60|$|They {{were members}} of Brant's own tribe, as <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> language, with which I was {{reasonably}} familiar, {{and after a few}} moments it was possible to gather from the conversation that St. Leger had interfered in some way with their plans, or thwarted their desires.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{expression}} on his face that any attempt at argument with him at the time would be useless, therefore held my peace; but had it in mind that by thus interfering he might be committing an offence such as the commandant would not readily forget.|$|E
60|$|Amelia {{turned them}} over. I know Amelia, too; and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> way Amelia {{looked at them}} that she meant to have them.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{direction}} of our march {{that they were}} taking me to Phutra. Once there I did not need much of an imagination to picture what my fate would be.

60|$|The shield-bearer returned, {{emerging}} {{from one of}} the narrow, reed-hedged passages, and after him came no executioner, but a young white man, who, as <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> look of him, was English.
