5|$|In July 1985, Roberts won {{the pole}} {{position}} at the prestigious Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race, held in Japan. Teamed with Tadahiko Taira, the duo were leading the race until the final hour, when mechanical problems <b>dropped</b> <b>them</b> back to seventeenth place. Roberts returned {{to compete in the}} 1986 Suzuka 8 Hours, this time teaming up with American Mike Baldwin. He qualified second behind Wayne Gardner, but failed to finish the race.|$|E
5|$|A week-long {{visit to}} White House Farm had been {{arranged}} for the August at the Bambers' request; the plan was that the boys would visit their grandparents with Sheila before going on holiday to Norway with their father. Daniel and Nicholas were reluctant {{to stay at the}} farm. They disliked that June made them pray, and in the car on the way asked their father to speak to her about it. In addition Daniel had become a vegetarian and was worried about being forced to eat meat. When their father <b>dropped</b> <b>them</b> off at the house on 4 August, {{it was the last time}} he saw them. The boys are buried together in Highgate Cemetery. Sheila was cremated, and the casket with her ashes was placed in their coffin.|$|E
5|$|DiBiase {{made his}} WWE {{television}} debut as a villain on May 26, 2008, where he cut a promo about his intent {{to become a}} champion like his father, Ted DiBiase Sr., challenging the World Tag Team Champions, Cody Rhodes and Hardcore Holly. At the Night of Champions pay-per-view, DiBiase won the World Tag Team Championship in his first match in WWE, after Rhodes betrayed Holly, revealing himself to be DiBiase's partner. After holding the title for just over a month, they <b>dropped</b> <b>them</b> to John Cena and Batista on the August 4 episode of Raw. The following week, DiBiase and Rhodes used their rematch clause to regain the title.|$|E

60|$|We did {{not have}} long to wait. Having passed several miles beyond our line of boats, the Macedonia {{proceeded}} to lower her own. We knew she carried fourteen boats to our five (we were one short through the desertion of Wainwright), and she began <b>dropping</b> <b>them</b> far to leeward of our last boat, continued <b>dropping</b> <b>them</b> athwart our course, and finished <b>dropping</b> <b>them</b> far to windward of our first weather boat. The hunting, for us, was spoiled. There were no seals behind us, and ahead of us the line of fourteen boats, like a huge broom, swept the herd before it.|$|R
5|$|In February 1990, the Southern Rockers vacated the {{championship}} and left PNW. They began {{competing for the}} United States Wrestling Association, where they quickly won the USWA World Tag Team Championship. Three days after winning the title belts, King and Doll <b>dropped</b> <b>them</b> to Robert Fuller and Brian Lee. They regained them six days later, however. On April 28, they lost the title to The Uptown Posse but were able to regain it {{less than a month}} later. On June 2, King competed in a handicap match, in which he faced The Dirty White Boys (Tony Anthony and Tom Burton). Unable to defeat both men, he lost the match and {{the championship}}.|$|E
5|$|In September 1994, Weisman {{died from}} {{pancreatic}} cancer in Los Angeles, and his relatives {{took over the}} racetrack. Although attendance and handle were increasing, the owners were losing money. Reports by independent auditors stated Rosecroft and Ocean Downs combined to lose $1.1 million in fiscal year (FY) 1992, $1.4 million in FY 1993, and $6.2 million in FY 1994. According to Rosecroft's racing official Allan Levey, Weisman's relatives {{did not want to}} operate the track and their only goal was to sell it. For the 1995 season, Rosecroft could not afford the payment to host five stake races—including the Messenger Stakes—and <b>dropped</b> <b>them</b> from the racing schedule.|$|E
5|$|With {{no time to}} make {{a coordinated}} plan of attack for the whole army, Khalid decided to storm the East Gate himself. He, Qa'qa ibn Amr, and Mazur ibn Adi climbed the wall hand-by-hand {{from the side of the}} gate. This part of the wall was the strongest, no guard was {{stationed}} at the top. They secured ropes to the wall and <b>dropped</b> <b>them</b> to 100 selected soldiers waiting at the base. Leaving a few men to assist the climbers, Khalid descended into the city, killing the guards at the inside of the East Gate. Khalid and Qa'qa flung the gate open and the remainder of Khalid's men entered the city. An intense battle ensued.|$|E

5|$|After {{upsetting}} second-ranked Michigan State, 34–7, Maryland {{climbed to}} an AP Poll ranking of {{eighth in the}} nation and then defeated Georgetown. The following game they met N.C. State at Byrd Stadium for Homecoming weekend. In the first quarter, a Maryland fumble rolled out of the end zone for a safety, and soon after, another fumble set up a touchdown rush by NC State. Maryland advanced inside the N.C. State five-yard line three times but was unable to score. In the third quarter, NC State scored again to expand their lead, 0–16. Maryland scored on a 21-yard pass from Jack Scarbath to Bob Shemonski. With three minutes remaining, Shemonski connected with a pass to Pete Augsburger for another touchdown. A 47-yard drive into Wolfpack territory ended with an interception in the end zone with seconds remaining. The loss effectively ended the Terrapins' hopes for a bowl game bid. The second loss <b>dropped</b> <b>them</b> out of the AP Poll {{for the remainder of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{they would}} be killed if the Malagasy {{discovered}} the truth while still on board ship, the crew sealed their messages in bottles and <b>dropped</b> <b>them</b> into the onshore current. The VOC authorities in Cape Town had sent their chief ship's carpenter, Philip van den Berg, with two other ship's carpenters, two pilots, a quartermaster and 20 sailors overland. Carpenters were needed since neither of Meermin boats, now onshore, could be used: one {{was buried in the}} sand, and the other was in need of repair. The party from Cape Town had arrived by 6March, and, while Johannes Le Sueur was overseeing the carpenters' examination of Meermins boats, he was handed a bottle containing a message signed by Jan de Leeuw. A second bottle, containing a message signed by Olof Leij, was also found and handed to Le Sueur, and the fires were lit on 7March. One of the messages is preserved in the Cape Archives Repository.|$|E
5|$|The game, {{which was}} the sixth edition of the bowl, was {{expected}} to be an offensive shootout. Boise State averaged 42.4points during the 2007 season, while East Carolina averaged 31. That expectation turned out to be justified as East Carolina took a 31–14 lead in the first half. The Broncos fought back in the second half, however, tying the score at 38 late in the fourth quarter after East Carolina's Chris Johnson fumbled the ball, allowing Bronco defender Marty Tadman to recover the ball and return it 47yards for a touchdown. The game remained tied until the final moments as East Carolina's Ben Hartman made a 34–yard game-winning field goal as time expired. The attendance of 30,467 was the largest crowd to attend a Hawaii Bowl game that did not feature the host school. Boise State's loss <b>dropped</b> <b>them</b> to a final 2007 record of 10–3, while East Carolina's final-game win earned them a record of 8–5.|$|E

5|$|After {{dropping}} the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship {{for a third}} and final time, the Blond Bombers began to challenge for the NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship. They defeated George Gulas and Ken Lucas to win the belts on December 15, 1979. While holding the title, they continued to feud with Gulas. When they attacked him one day, his estranged partner Bobby Eaton rescued him; Gulas and Eaton reunited as The Jet Set and defeated the Bombers to win the championship. Latham and Farris regained the belts in a rematch against The Jet Set but later <b>dropped</b> <b>them</b> to Rocky Brewer and Pat Rose. The Blond Bombers had one last reign with the Mid-America belts, as they defeated Eaton and Great Togo in July 1980. They held the title until September 3, when they lost a match to Robert Gibson and Don Fargo. After losing the belts, Farris left to compete in Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council. Upon returning to Tennessee, he found other partners and had two more reigns as an AWA Southern Tag Team Champion. Latham soon left Tennessee {{to compete in the}} World Wrestling Federation, where he held the WWF Tag Team Championship as Spot, a member of The Moondogs.|$|E
5|$|Deep Purple {{arrived in}} California on 15 October 1968 and their first public {{appearance}} on American soil was at The Dating Game TV show on ABC on 17 October. They {{were the first}} rock band to perform on the show, where Jon Lord {{was one of the}} contestants. The next two days the band played live in the US {{for the first time as}} supporting act of Cream in their Goodbye tour. The concerts were held at the Inglewood Forum near Los Angeles, California, in front of more than 16,000 people every night. Recordings of those live shows were issued in 2002 as Inglewood – Live in California. The next gig at San Diego was the last one supporting Cream, whose management apparently did not appreciate the cheerful reaction of the audience to Deep Purple and <b>dropped</b> <b>them.</b> After a week of forced stop, their American manager succeeded in setting up a tour which included the San Francisco International Pop Festival and venues on the West Coast. This opportunity was very useful for the young musicians, who as headliners could lengthen their live shows up to 90 minutes and gained much needed experience on the road. This was particularly true for Blackmore, who developed and extended his guitar solos, incorporating more improvisations.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{broke out}} in the factory at around 2:30 IST, as workers slept. Once they became aware of the blaze, the {{employees}} found they were unable to break through the factory's locked doors. Five fire tenders were sent to the scene, but by the time they arrived, local residents had broken down two locked gates and already rescued the surviving workers. These impromptu Rescue efforts were delayed however, when an individual carrying keys to open the door nervously <b>dropped</b> <b>them</b> while attempting to open the gate. At least 10 people were dead by the time rescuers reached the factory's interior, with a further eighteen injured. The survivors, many suffering from burns over 70 percent of their bodies, were taken to the National Medical College and Hospital, where victims had to be left on the floor due to a shortage of beds. The hospital did not have a burns unit, and the only treatments available at the hospital were ointments and saline drips. The patients were eventually moved to other hospitals. Local MLA Javed Khan later said that the death toll is actually at least twelve, but there has been no official confirmation of this. The Rapid Action Force was also deployed to maintain calm.|$|E
