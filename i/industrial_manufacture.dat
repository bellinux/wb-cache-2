The <b>industrial</b> <b>manufacture</b> of ephedrine in China began in the 1920s, when the American pharmaceutical company Merck began marketing and selling the drug as ephetonin.

5|$|In 1516, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, {{adopted the}} Reinheitsgebot (purity law), perhaps the oldest food-quality {{regulation}} {{still in use}} in the 21st century, according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water, hops and barley-malt. Beer produced before the Industrial Revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD, beer was also being produced and sold by European monasteries. During the Industrial Revolution, the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to <b>industrial</b> <b>manufacture,</b> and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant {{by the end of}} the 19th century.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the era, with difficult terrain, poor roads and methods of transport there was little trade between different areas of the country and most settlements depended on what was produced locally, often with very little in reserve in bad years. Most farming was based on the lowland fermtoun or highland baile, settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers. They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset the problems of extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective and cheaper to feed than horses. From the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland experienced a decline in demand for exports of cloth and wool to the continent. Scots responded by selling larger quantities of traditional goods, increasing the output of salt, herring and coal. The late sixteenth century was an era of economic distress, probably exacerbated by increasing taxation and the devaluation of the currency. In 1582 a pound of silver produced 640 shillings, but in 1601 it was 960 and the exchange rate with England was £6 Scots to £1 sterling in 1565, but by 1601 it had fallen to £12. Wages rose rapidly, by between four or five times between 1560 {{and the end of the}} century, but failed to keep pace with inflation. This situation was punctuated by frequent harvest failures, with almost half the years in the second half of the sixteenth century seeing local or national scarcity, necessitating the shipping of large quantities of grain from the Baltic. Distress was exacerbated by outbreaks of plague, with major epidemics in the periods 1584–88 and 1597–1609. There were {{the beginning}}s of <b>industrial</b> <b>manufacture</b> in this period, often using expertise from the continent, which included a failed attempt to use Flemings to teach new techniques in the developing cloth industry in the north-east, but more successful in bringing a Venetian to help develop a native glass blowing industry.

This study {{analyses}} how far {{the strong}} expansion of Argentine exports since 2003 has been due simply to favourable external conditions and how <b>industrial</b> <b>manufactures</b> have behaved. It finds that the country's pattern of international specialization has not greatly altered at the major category level, but that both primary products and manufactures of agricultural origin, which account {{for much of the}} trade surplus, have undergone significant changes in composition. In addition, regional trade has consolidated and traditional partners such as the European Union and the United States have been displaced to some extent by China. <b>Industrial</b> <b>manufactures</b> have continued to suffer from a strong comparative disadvantage, but certain high-technology industrial sectors, such as agricultural machinery and pumps and compressors, have started to become competitive, while seamless oil and gas tubing is already highly competitive...|$|R
500|$|Morris {{was heavily}} {{influenced}} by {{the writings of the}} art critic John Ruskin, being particularly inspired by his chapter [...] "On the Nature of Gothic Architecture" [...] in the second volume of The Stones of Venice; he later described it as [...] "one of the very few necessary and inevitable utterances of the century". Morris adopted Ruskin's philosophy of rejecting the tawdry <b>industrial</b> <b>manufacture</b> of decorative arts and architecture in favour of a return to hand-craftsmanship, raising artisans to the status of artists, creating art that should be affordable and hand-made, with no hierarchy of artistic mediums. Ruskin had achieved attention in Victorian society for championing the art of a group of painters who had emerged in London in 1848 calling themselves the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. The Pre-Raphaelite style was heavily Medievalist and Romanticist, emphasising abundant detail, intense colours and complex compositions; it greatly impressed Morris and the Set. Influenced both by Ruskin and by John Keats, Morris began to spend more time writing poetry, in a style that was imitative of much of theirs.|$|E
500|$|The {{large scale}} {{reproduction}} of a comic strip frame was considered radical and revolutionary at the time. Critics applauded the work's playfulness, inherent humor and irreverence. According to Diane Waldman of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, [...] "Look Mickey is broad comedy and {{falls into the}} category of slapstick..." [...] In Lichtenstein's obituary, Los Angeles Times critic Christopher Knight described the work as [...] "a slyly hilarious riff on Abstract Expressionism". Lichtenstein's slight alterations to its [...] "linear clarity and colour", the critic writes, add to its aesthetic value and grandeur, reinforced by his choice of scale. A common misconception about Lichtenstein {{comes from the fact that}} in his best known works, his meticulous approach to painting is purposely disguised because he superficially seeks his paintings to appear as if facsimiles of industrial produced pop culture icons. Graham Bader wrote that [...] "Lichtenstein's painting in fact appears more the product of <b>industrial</b> <b>manufacture</b> than the very pulp image on which it is based." [...] Look Mickey is considered self-referential in the sense that the artist is painting something through which the viewer may see elements of the artist.|$|E

2500|$|The Arts and Crafts {{philosophy}} derived {{in large}} measure from John Ruskin's social criticism, which related the moral and social health of a nation to the qualities of its architecture and {{to the nature of}} work. Ruskin (1819–1900) considered the sort of mechanized production and division of labour that had been created in the industrial revolution to be [...] "servile labour" [...] and he thought that a healthy and moral society required independent workers who designed the things they made. His followers favoured craft production over <b>industrial</b> <b>manufacture</b> and were concerned about the loss of traditional skills, but they were arguably more troubled by effects of the factory system than by machinery itself and William Morris's idea of [...] "handicraft" [...] was essentially work without any division of labour rather than work without any sort of machinery.|$|E
2500|$|The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (PRB) {{achieved}} considerable influence {{after its}} foundation in 1848 with paintings that concentrated on religious, literary, and genre subjects executed in a colourful and minutely detailed style, rejecting the loose painterly brushwork {{of the tradition}} represented by [...] "Sir Sloshua" [...] Reynolds. [...] PRB artists included John Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Ford Madox Brown (never officially a member), and figures such as Edward Burne-Jones and John William Waterhouse were later much influenced by aspects of their ideas, as was the designer William Morris. Morris advocated a return to hand-craftsmanship in the decorative arts over the <b>industrial</b> <b>manufacture</b> that was rapidly being applied to all crafts. His efforts to make beautiful objects affordable (or even free) for everyone led to his wallpaper and tile designs defining the Victorian aesthetic and instigating the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E
2500|$|The neola is a {{stringed}} {{musical instrument}} invented in 1970 by Goronwy Bradley Davies, Llanbedr, Wales. Plastics and aluminium {{were used in}} the design and the invention was recognized in a British Patent (registered 16 August 1972) and a Design Council award. The name [...] "Neola" [...] was registered for the instrument. The invention is intended as a tenor, replacing an instrument in the viol family that has been surpassed by the more recent violin family. The strings are tuned to G2, D3, A3, and E4, an octave below the violin, and the instrument may be performed similar to a violoncello. ‘Cello players would need to adapt their technique to accommodate the shorter string and body length, and use of the thumb position would not be the same. The design specifications are well suited to <b>industrial</b> <b>manufacture,</b> retaining consistency in quality. This is not the case with traditional instruments since the choice of fine materials and the skills of the luthier are essential in producing instruments with superior sound qualities.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{influential}} {{figure of the}} most important phase of the Gothic Revival, however, in Birmingham and worldwide, was Augustus Pugin. Pugin first became involved with Birmingham in 1833, designing the Gothic detailing for Charles Barry's rebuilding of King Edward's School (demolished) in New Street. This was the first secular building in Birmingham to demonstrate the emerging, more scholarly use of gothic, being designed in a Tudor style to reflect the school's 16th century foundation. It was also the first work of the partnership between Barry and Pugin that would later design the Palace of Westminster in London, and it established the pattern that Westminster was to follow, with gothic detailing on a fundamentally classical, symmetrical composition. As a centre of <b>industrial</b> <b>manufacture,</b> with a reputation for religious non-conformism and a largely Georgian streetscape, Birmingham was anathema to Pugin's craft-based, high-church, medievalist outlook, and in 1833 he condemned it as [...] "that most detestable of detestable places - Birmingham, where Greek buildings and smoking chimneys, Radicals and Dissenters are blended together". However Birmingham's ferment of religious diversity also placed it {{at the heart of the}} mid-19th-century English Catholic Revival, and after his conversion to Catholicism in 1834 Pugin quickly became associated with Birmingham's Oscott College, where he was to live from 1837 as college architect and Professor of Ecclesiastical Art and Architecture. During this period he built a series of buildings in Birmingham that marked the turning point in the use of Gothic as a functional, honest expression of the form and function of building.|$|E
