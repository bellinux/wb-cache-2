40|$|Two {{plant growth}} {{promoting}} Pseudomonas fluorescens isolates namely UOM SAR 14 and UOM SAR 80 most effectively induced resistance against downy mildew disease of pearl millet both under greenhouse and field conditions. Relative assessment of <b>live</b> <b>cultures</b> of P. fluorescens UOM SAR 14 and UOM SAR 80 and their lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from their cell walls were evaluated {{for their ability}} to induce resistance against pearl millet downy mildew. Treatment with P. fluorescens and their LPS enhanced the seed germination and seedling vigour considerably. Although both <b>live</b> <b>cultures</b> and their LPS treatment induced resistance in pearl millet against downy mildew disease both under greenhouse and field conditions as evidenced by the significant reduction of the disease, <b>live</b> <b>cultures</b> were more effective than the LPS in level of resistance induced. <b>Live</b> <b>cultures</b> of UOM SAR 14 and UOM SAR 80 induced 66 % and 57 % protection while their respective LPS extracts offered 59 and 53 % protection against downy mildew disease under greenhouse conditions. Similarly, under field conditions with very heavy inoculum pressure <b>live</b> <b>cultures</b> offered 75 % and 70 %, and their LPS offered 71 % and 67 % protection, respectively. In either case, the time gap required for the building up of resistance was found to be 3 days and nature of the resistance induced was systemic and durable with both <b>live</b> <b>cultures</b> and their lipopolysaccharides. It was also noticed that the live bacteria significantly varied in the degree of protection offered and so also their respective LPS...|$|R

40|$|A {{treatment}} {{containing a}} live food-grade organism, Lactococcus lactis DPC 3147, was compared with conventional antibiotic therapy for {{its potential to}} treat bovine chronic subclinical or clinical mastitis in two separate field trials. Effects on disease symptoms and bacteriology were monitored in response to infusion with the culture in each trial. In the first trial, the <b>live</b> <b>culture</b> treatment was compared with an intramammary antibiotic (n= 11 quarters for each treatment). Results from this small trial demonstrated that the <b>live</b> <b>culture</b> had potential to be as effective at eliminating chronic subclinical infections as an antibiotic treatment. By day 12, 7 of the 11 quarters treated with the <b>live</b> <b>culture</b> were pathogen-free compared with 5 of the 11 antibiotic-treated infected quarters. Somatic cell counts (SCC) remained relatively unchanged regardless of treatment: average log SCC pre- and post-treatment in the lactococci-treated group were 6 · 33 ± 0 · 41 (day 0) and 6 · 27 ± 0 · 43 cells/ml (day 12) and average log SCC pre- and post-treatment in the antibiotic-treated group were 6 · 34 ± 0 · 37 and 6 · 22 ± 0 · 46 cells/ml on day 0 and on day 12, respectively. In the second trial, the <b>live</b> <b>culture</b> was compared with an intramammary antibiotic {{for the treatment of}} naturally occurring clinical mastitis cases (n= 25 quarters for each treatment). Following a 14 -d experimental period, similar bacteriological responses were observed in 7 out of 25 <b>live</b> <b>culture</b> treated quarters and 9 out of 25 antibiotic-treated quarters. Additionally, 15 of 25 cases treated with the culture and 18 of 25 cases treated with the antibiotic did not exhibit clinical signs of the disease following treatment. The results of these trials suggest that <b>live</b> <b>culture</b> treatment with Lc. lactis DPC 3147 may be as efficacious as common antibiotic treatments in some instances...|$|R

40|$|Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is a {{cyanobacterium}} {{responsible for}} the production of the toxin, cylindrospermopsin (CYN). Tadpoles of the cane toad Bufo marinus were exposed to freeze-thawed whole cell extracts or <b>live</b> <b>cultures</b> of C. raciborskii containing maximum CYN concentrations of 400 micrograms per litre or 232 micrograms per litre, respectively. Exposure to <b>live</b> <b>culture</b> treatment solutions resulted in up to 66 % mortality of B. marinus, whereas tadpoles exposed to whole cell extracts containing similar toxin concentrations survived. Decreases in relative growth rates and time spent for swimming were recorded from tadpoles during both types of exposure regimes. Bioconcentration of CYN was not evident following exposure to whole cell extracts containing extracellular toxin. In contrast exposure to <b>live</b> <b>cultures,</b> which contained cell-bound toxin, resulted in maximum average tissue concentrations of 895 micrograms of free-CYN per kg fresh weight.

50|$|S. thermophilus {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{bacteria}} in the dairy industry. USDA statistics from 1998 showed that more than 1.02 billion kilograms of mozzarella cheese and 621 million kilograms of yogurt were produced from S. thermophilus. Although its genus, Streptococcus, includes some pathogenic species, food industries consider S. thermophilus a safer bacterium than many other Streptococcus species. In fact, yogurt and cheese that contain <b>live</b> <b>cultures</b> of S. thermophilus are thought to be beneficial to health. <b>Live</b> <b>cultures</b> of S. thermophilus make it easier for people who are lactose intolerant to digest dairy products.

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of six bacterial strains on gilthead sea bream larvae (Sparus aurata). Methods and Results: Six bacterial strains <b>isolated</b> from well-performing <b>live</b> food <b>cultures</b> were identified by sequencing fragments of their 16 s rDNA genome to the genus level as Cytophaga sp., Roseobacter sp., Ruergeria sp., Paracoccus sp., Aeromonas sp. and Shewanella sp. Survival rates of gilthead sea bream larvae transferred to seawater added these bacterial strains at concentrations of 6 +/- 0. 3 x 10 (5) bacteria ml(- 1) were similar to those of larvae transferred to sterilized seawater and showed an average of 86 % at 9 days after hatching, whereas, survival rates of larvae transferred to filtered seawater were lower (P < 0. 05), and showed an average of 39 %, 9 days after hatching. Conclusion: Several bacterial strains <b>isolated</b> from well-performing <b>live</b> food <b>cultures</b> showed a positive effect for sea bream larvae when compared with filtered seawater. Significance and Impact of the Study: The approach used in this study could be applied as an in vivo evaluation method of candidate probiotic strains used in the rearing of marine fish larvae...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of lithotrophic Fe(II) -oxidizing bacteria on patterns of ferric oxide deposition in opposing gradients of Fe(II) and O 2 was examined at submillimeter resolution {{by use of}} an O 2 microelectrode and diffusion microprobes for iron. In cultures inoculated with lithotrophic Fe(II) -oxidizing bacteria, the majority of Fe(III) deposition occurred below the depth of O 2 penetration. In contrast, Fe(III) deposition in abiotic control cultures occurred entirely within the aerobic zone. The diffusion microprobes revealed the formation of soluble or colloidal Fe(III) compounds during biological Fe(II) oxidation. The presence of mobile Fe(III) in diffusion probes from <b>live</b> <b>cultures</b> was verified by washing the probes in anoxic water, which removed ca. 70 % of the Fe(III) content of probes from <b>live</b> <b>cultures</b> but did not alter the Fe(III) content of probes from abiotic controls. Measurements {{of the amount of}} Fe(III) oxide deposited in the medium versus the probes indicated that ca. 90 % of the Fe(III) deposited in <b>live</b> <b>cultures</b> was formed biologically. Our findings show that bacterial Fe(II) oxidation is likely to generate reactive Fe(III) compounds that can be immediately available for use as electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration and that biological Fe(II) oxidation may thereby promote rapid microscale Fe redox cycling at aerobic-anaerobic interfaces...|$|R
40|$|If <b>live</b> <b>cultures</b> {{of a mouse}} {{strain of}} Bacillus pestis caviæ are {{injected}} intrapleurally or intraperitoneally into normal mice, there occurs an initial lag {{in the rate of}} bacterial multiplication lasting a few hours, followed by a rapid and continued acceleration of growth until the death of the animal. If <b>live</b> <b>cultures</b> of this organism are given per os to normal mice, there occurs an incubation period of 5 to 6 days, after which the animal usually develops symptoms of disease and succumbs. A small percentage of mice, however, proves refractory to infection by this route. If <b>live</b> <b>cultures</b> of this organism are injected intrapleurally or intraperitoneally into mice previously "vaccinated" intrapleurally or intraperitoneally, they are partially destroyed and held in check by the protective mechanisms of the animal body for 2 or 3 days. Subsequently the rate of bacterial multiplication increases gradually until the death of the animal. The partial protection following this type of "vaccination" is entirely of a general nature; no evidence of a local immunity has been obtained. Mice given one, two, or three subcutaneous doses of "vaccine" show a similar relative increase in resistance to the subsequent intraperitoneal or per os injection of live organisms. Feeding mice <b>live</b> or killed <b>cultures</b> of this organism induces a definite protection against subsequent intrastomachal and intraperitoneal injections of live organisms. The immunity developed in this way is also of a general as opposed to a local nature...|$|R
