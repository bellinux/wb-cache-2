60|$|Who are they? We {{have seen}} that around Capital Punishment there lingers a fascination, urging weak and bad people towards it, and imparting an {{interest}} to details connected with it, and with malefactors awaiting it or suffering it, which even good and well- disposed people cannot withstand. We know that last-dying speeches and Newgate calendars are the favourite literature of very low intellects. The gallows is not appealed to as an example in the instruction of youth (unless they are training for it); nor are there condensed accounts of celebrated executions {{for the use of}} national schools. There is a story in an old spelling-book of a certain Don't Care who was hanged at last, but it is not understood to have had any remarkable effect on crimes or executions in the generation to which it belonged, and with which it has passed away. Hogarth's idle apprentice is hanged; but the whole scene--with the unmistakable stout lady, drunk <b>and</b> pious, in <b>the</b> cast; the quarrelling, blasphemy, lewdness, and uproar; Tiddy Doll vending his <b>gingerbread,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> boys picking his pocket--is a bitter satire on the great example; as efficient then, as now.|$|R

60|$|The child, staring with round eyes at this {{instance}} of liberality, wholly unprecedented in his large experience of cent-shops, took <b>the</b> man of <b>gingerbread,</b> <b>and</b> quitted <b>the</b> premises. No sooner had {{he reached the}} sidewalk (little cannibal that he was!) than Jim Crow's head was in his mouth. As {{he had not been}} careful to shut the door, Hepzibah was at the pains of closing it after him, with a pettish ejaculation or two about the troublesomeness of young people, and particularly of small boys. She had just placed another representative of the renowned Jim Crow at the window, when again the shop-bell tinkled clamorously, <b>and</b> again <b>the</b> door being thrust open, with its characteristic jerk <b>and</b> jar, disclosed <b>the</b> same sturdy little urchin who, precisely two minutes ago, had made his exit. <b>The</b> crumbs <b>and</b> discoloration of <b>the</b> cannibal feast, as yet hardly consummated, were exceedingly visible about his mouth.|$|R

Hepzibah's final operation was with the little devourer of Jim Crow <b>and</b> <b>the</b> elephant, who now proposed to eat a camel. In her bewilderment, she offered him first a wooden dragoon, and next a handful of marbles; neither of which being adapted to his else omnivorous appetite, she hastily held out her whole remaining stock of natural history in <b>gingerbread,</b> <b>and</b> huddled <b>the</b> small customer out of the shop. She then muffled the bell in an unfinished stocking, <b>and</b> put up <b>the</b> oaken bar across the door.|$|R
