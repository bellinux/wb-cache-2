5|$|As {{a result}} of the tension in late-December, the {{standoff}} remained. The US hoped the generals would relent because they could not survive and be able to repel the communists or rival officers without aid from Washington. On the other hand, Khánh and the Young Turks expected the Americans would become more worried about the communist gains first and acquiesce to their <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> against the HNC. The generals were correct.|$|E
5|$|Seeing no {{alternative}} to avoid further bloodshed, the Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman decided to expel Singapore from the federation. Goh Keng Swee, who had become skeptical of merger's economic benefits for Singapore, convinced Lee Kuan Yew that the separation had to take place. UMNO and PAP representatives worked out the terms of separation in extreme secrecy in order to present the British government, in particular, with a <b>fait</b> <b>accompli.</b>|$|E
5|$|Castillo Armas' army of 480 men was {{not large}} enough to defeat the Guatemalan military, even with U.S.-supplied aircraft. Therefore, the plans for Operation PBSUCCESS called for a {{campaign}} of psychological warfare, which would present Castillo Armas' victory as a <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> to the Guatemalan people, and would force Árbenz to resign. The propaganda campaign had begun well before the invasion, with the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) writing hundreds of articles on Guatemala based on CIA reports, and distributing {{tens of thousands of}} leaflets throughout Latin America. The CIA persuaded friendly governments to screen video footage of Guatemala that supported the U.S. version of events.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, West Germany and the Allies {{rejected}} East Germany's legitimacy. The {{creation of}} East Germany was deemed a communist/Soviet <b>fait</b> <b>accompli,</b> without a freely or fairly elected government. West Germany regarded German citizenship and rights as applying equally to East and West German citizens. An East German who escaped or was {{released to the}} West was automatically granted West German rights including residence, the right to work, and EEC freedom of movement; West German laws were deemed to be applicable in the East. East Germans thus had a powerful incentive {{to move to the}} West, where they would enjoy greater freedom and economic prospects.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the negotiations, the {{military}} situation on the ground was threatening Lithuania not only in the Suwałki Region, but also in Vilnius. The Polish leader, Józef Piłsudski, feared that the Entente and the League might accept the <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> that had been created by the Soviet transfer of Vilnius to Lithuania on August 26, 1920. Already on September 22, Sapieha asked Paderewski to gauge the possible reaction of the League in case military units in the Kresy decided to attack Vilnius, following the example of the Italian Gabriele D'Annunzio, who in 1919 staged a mutiny and took over the city of Fiume. By agreeing to the negotiations, the Poles sought to buy time and distract attention from the Vilnius Region. The Lithuanians hoped to avoid new Polish attacks and, with help of the League, to settle the disputes.|$|E
5|$|Castillo Armas {{was given}} {{enough money to}} recruit a small force of mercenaries from among Guatemalan exiles and the populations of nearby countries. This band was called the Army of Liberation. The CIA {{established}} training camps in Nicaragua and Honduras and supplied them with weapons {{as well as several}} bombers. The U.S. signed military agreements with both those countries prior to the invasion of Guatemala, allowing it to move heavier arms freely. These preparations were only superficially covert: the CIA intended Árbenz to find out about them, as a part of its plan to convince the Guatemalan people that the overthrow of Árbenz was a <b>fait</b> <b>accompli.</b> Additionally, the CIA made covert contact with a number of church leaders throughout the Guatemalan countryside, and persuaded them to incorporate anti-government messages into their sermons.|$|E
5|$|On February 8, 1942, Minister of Armaments Fritz Todt {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} shortly after taking off from Hitler's eastern {{headquarters}} at Rastenburg. Speer, who had arrived in Rastenburg the previous evening, had accepted Todt's offer to fly with him to Berlin, but had canceled some hours before takeoff (Speer stated in his memoirs that the cancellation was because of exhaustion from travel and a late-night meeting with Hitler). Later that day, Hitler appointed Speer as Todt's successor to all of his posts. In Inside the Third Reich, Speer recounts his meeting with Hitler and his reluctance to take ministerial office, saying that he only did so because Hitler commanded it. Speer also states that Hermann Göring raced to Hitler's headquarters on hearing of Todt's death, hoping to claim Todt's powers. Hitler instead presented Göring with the <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> of Speer's appointment.|$|E
5|$|By 21 July 1914, the British had {{postponed}} {{delivery of}} Reşadiye and Sultan Osman-ı Evvel as tensions flared in Europe following {{the assassination of}} Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June. This action prompted a protest by Djemal Pasha, the Ottoman naval minister, via France, {{in the hopes of}} securing the ships' delivery. A transport ship carrying crews for the two battleships departed Constantinople on 4 August, only to be recalled on 7 August after the Ottoman government was informed that the dreadnoughts would not be delivered. First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill ordered the Royal Navy to detain the two ships on 29 July and prevent Ottoman naval personnel from boarding them; two days later, British sailors boarded the ships and formally seized them. Since Britain was not yet at war, these actions were illegal; the British government nevertheless determined to present the Ottomans with a <b>fait</b> <b>accompli.</b> On 3 August, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire informed the government that Britain had seized the ships.|$|E
5|$|The December 1964 South Vietnamese coup {{took place}} before dawn on December 19, 1964, when the ruling {{military}} junta of South Vietnam led by General Nguyễn Khánh dissolved the High National Council (HNC) and arrested {{some of its}} members. The HNC was an unelected legislative-style civilian advisory body they had created {{at the request of}} the United States—South Vietnam's main sponsor—to give a veneer of civilian rule. The dissolution dismayed the Americans, particularly the ambassador, Maxwell D. Taylor, who engaged in an angry war of words with various generals including Khánh and threatened aid cuts. They were unable to do anything about the <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> that had been handed to them, because they strongly desired to win the Vietnam War and needed to support the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. Instead, Taylor's searing verbal attacks were counterproductive as they galvanized the Vietnamese officers around the embattled Khánh. At the time, Khánh's leadership was under threat from his fellow generals, as well as Taylor, who had fallen out with him and was seeking his removal.|$|E
5|$|Theodore's brother Manuel, {{who managed}} to escape from Klokotnitsa, now took over the throne in Thessalonica. His domain was reduced to the environs {{of the city and}} his family's core territories in Epirus and Thessaly, as well as Dyrrhachium and Corfu, while his brother Constantine in Aetolia and Acarnania {{recognized}} his suzerainty. As a son-in-law of John Asen, Manuel was allowed to maintain internal autonomy, but to all intents and purposes he was a client of the Bulgarian Tsar. At about the same time, Michael I's bastard son Michael II returned from exile and quickly succeeded, apparently {{with the support of the}} local population, in taking over control of Epirus. Manuel was forced to recognize the <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> under the pretense that Michael recognized his suzerainty, in token of which Manuel conferred him the title of Despot. In reality Michael was fully independent, and very quickly ceased to acknowledge Manuel's suzerainty; by 1236, he had seized Corfu. In order to preserve some freedom of manoeuvre and counter Asen's attempts to subordinate the Epirote Church to the Bulgarian Church of Tarnovo, Manuel turned to his brother's erstwhile rivals in Nicaea and brought an end to the ecclesiastical schism by acknowledging the legitimacy and superiority of the Nicaea-based Patriarch.|$|E
25|$|Definitive Force: {{the use of}} gunboat {{diplomacy}} {{to create}} or remove a <b>fait</b> <b>accompli.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Trajan and Roman {{withdrawal}} from the area, Osroes I easily defeated Parthamaspates and reclaimed the Persian throne. Hadrian acknowledged this <b>fait</b> <b>accompli,</b> recognized Osroes I, Parthamaspates King of Osroene, and returned Osroes I's daughter who had been taken prisoner by Trajan.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Trajan and Roman {{withdrawal}} from the area, Osroes easily defeated Parthamaspates and reclaimed the Persian throne. Hadrian acknowledged this <b>fait</b> <b>accompli,</b> recognized Osroes, Parthamaspates king of Osroene, and returned Osroes' daughter who had been taken prisoner by Trajan (as a warranty to control his client state).|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of these tensions, a {{standoff}} started between the Americans and the Vietnamese generals. The U.S. had hoped the generals would relent because they could not survive without aid from Washington, and {{that they would not be}} able to repel the communists or rival officers without bending to receive support. On the other hand, Khánh hoped the Americans would become more worried about the communists first and acquiesce to their <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> against the HNC.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{stance of}} the Irish Volunteers was that action {{would only be}} taken were the British authorities at Dublin Castle to attempt to disarm the Volunteers, arrest their leaders, or introduce conscription to Ireland. The IRB, however, was determined to use the Volunteers for offensive action while Britain was {{tied up in the}} First World War. Their plan was to circumvent MacNeill's command, instigating a Rising, and to get MacNeill on board once the rising was a <b>fait</b> <b>accompli.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{countries}} {{disputed the}} attribution of Japan. Since neither could colonize it, the exclusive right to propagate Christianity in Japan meant the exclusive right {{to trade with}} Japan. Portuguese-sponsored Jesuits under Alessandro Valignano {{took the lead in}} proselytizing in Japan over the objection of the Spaniards, starting in 1579. The <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> was approved in Pope Gregory XIII's papal bull of 1575, which decided that Japan belonged to the Portuguese Diocese of Macau. In 1588, the diocese of Funai (Nagasaki) was founded under Portuguese protection.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that skirmishes and battles have begun, the Jews at this stage {{are still trying to}} contain the {{fighting}} to as narrow a sphere as possible in the hope that partition will be implemented and a Jewish government formed; they hope that if the fighting remains limited, the Arabs will acquiesce in the <b>fait</b> <b>accompli.</b> This can be seen from {{the fact that}} the Jews have not so far attacked Arab villages unless the inhabitants of those villages attacked them or provoked them first.|$|E
25|$|The {{short-term}} {{effect of}} the Treaty was to prevent the sale of Māori land to anyone other than the Crown. This was intended to protect Māori from the kinds of shady land purchases which had alienated indigenous peoples {{in other parts of}} the world from their land with minimal compensation. Anticipating the Treaty, the New Zealand Company made several hasty land deals and shipped settlers from Great Britain to New Zealand, hoping the British would be forced to accept its land claims as a <b>fait</b> <b>accompli.</b>|$|E
25|$|Originally named Sting, Pickle {{was built}} in 1799 in Bermuda, where this type of vessel {{was known as a}} Bermuda sloop. Vice-Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour, the {{commander}} in chief on the Jamaica Station, formally purchased Sting in December 1800 for £2,500, after having leased her for some time at £10 per day. His purchase was in defiance of orders not to purchase vessels. However, faced with a <b>fait</b> <b>accompli,</b> the Admiralty issued an order in February 1801 that her name be changed to Pickle.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union invaded Eastern Poland on September 17, {{its path}} cleared {{by the lack}} of British and French {{military}} activity against the Nazis in Western Poland. It wanted to build a cordon against German military strength west of the Soviet Union's national border. The Stalin regime went further, however, making its nonaggression pact into a de facto Friendship Pact by signing a joint statement with the Germans characterizing the partition of Poland as a <b>fait</b> <b>accompli,</b> calling for an end to hostilities, and placing the onus for any escalation of the European conflict on the governments of Great Britain and France.|$|E
25|$|On 17 December, in {{a meeting}} with Yeltsin, Gorbachev {{accepted}} the <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> and agreed to dissolve the Soviet Union. On 24 December, the Russian Federation, by mutual agreement of the other CIS states (which by this time included all of the remaining republics except Georgia) took the Soviet Union's seat in the United Nations. The next day, Gorbachev resigned and the Soviet Union ceased to exist—thereby ending the world's oldest, largest and most powerful Communist state. Economic relations between the former Soviet republics were severely compromised. Millions of ethnic Russians found themselves in the newly formed foreign countries.|$|E
25|$|British leaders—and {{those on}} the Continent—generally {{believed}} that division of the U.S. was inevitable. Remembering their own unsuccessful attempt to keep their former American colonies in the Empire by force of arms, the British considered Union efforts to resist a <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> to be unreasonable, but they also viewed Union resistance as a {{fact that they had}} to deal with. Believing the war's outcome to be predetermined, the British saw any action they could take to encourage {{the end of the war}} as a humanitarian gesture. Lyons was instructed by Russell to use his own office and any other parties who might promote a settlement of the war.|$|E
25|$|Childs was {{surprised}} with the <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> at the June 27, 1947, plenary {{meeting of the}} National Committee, at which {{he was forced to}} resign the editorial post, ostensibly due to the heart ailment which plagued him. Exacerbating the situation, Childs was not even informed of Dennis's decision that he was to be removed until the matter was brought up at the meeting. On Dennis's motion, Childs was given an indefinite leave of absence as Daily Worker editor, replaced by Spanish Civil War veteran Johnny Gates. Childs returned home to Chicago, smarting from his comrades' betrayal, and discontinued further party activities, citing reasons of health.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of May 25, Truscott {{received}} new orders from Clark via his Operations Officer, Brigadier General Don Brand. These were, in effect, to implement Operation Turtle and turn the main line of attack 90 degrees to the left. Most importantly, although the attack towards Valmontone and Route6 would continue, 1stArmored were to withdraw to prepare to exploit the planned breakthrough along the new line of attack leaving 3rdDivision to continue towards Valmontone with 1st Special Service Force in support. Clark informed Alexander of these developments late {{in the morning of}} May26 by which time the change of orders was a <b>fait</b> <b>accompli.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{initially}} {{envisioned by}} Warnecke, the site would be accessed by a circular granite walkway {{which led to}} an elliptical marble plaza. The downslope side of the elliptical plaza would be enclosed by a low wall inscribed with quotes from Kennedy's speeches. Marble steps led up from the plaza to a rectangular terrace which enclosed a rectangular plot of grass in which the graves would reside. A retaining wall formed {{the rear of the}} burial site. The eternal flame would be placed {{in the center of the}} grassy plot in a flat, triangular bronze sculpture intended to resemble a votive candle or brazier. The original design won near-universal praise. The U.S. Department of Defense formally hired Warnecke to design the approaches (although this was a <b>fait</b> <b>accompli).</b>|$|E
25|$|However, on 12 December, the RSFSR Supreme Soviet {{ratified}} the Belevezha Accords and denounced the 1922 Union Treaty. It was now {{apparent that the}} momentum towards dissolution could not be stopped. Shortly after the RSFSR {{ratified the}} Accords, Gorbachev hinted that he was considering stepping aside. On 17 December, he accepted the <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> and reluctantly agreed with Yeltsin to dissolve the Soviet Union. Four days later, the leaders of 11 of the 12 remaining republics—all except Georgia (the Baltic states had already seceded in August)—signed the Alma-Ata Protocol which formally established the CIS. They also preemptively accepted Gorbachev's resignation. When Gorbachev learned what had transpired, he told CBS that he would resign {{as soon as he}} saw that the CIS was indeed a reality.|$|E
25|$|Presented as an {{uprising}} {{of the local}} population, the revolt met little resistance from either the German Police or the French Army. The rebels established a pro-Lithuanian administration, which petitioned to unite with Lithuania, citing the right of self-determination. The League of Nations accepted the <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> and the Klaipėda Region was transferred as an autonomous territory to the Republic of Lithuania on February 17, 1923. After prolonged negotiations a formal international agreement, the Klaipėda Convention, was signed in May 1924. The convention formally acknowledged Lithuania's sovereignty {{in the region and}} outlined its extensive legislative, judicial, administrative, and financial autonomy. The region remained part of Lithuania until March 1939 when it was transferred to Nazi Germany after the German ultimatum.|$|E
25|$|In the process, further {{extensions}} {{were planned}} and in 1975 spending {{was expected to}} reach reached $1.6 billion ($7.3 billion in 2016). Faced with these soaring costs, the Government of Quebec declared a moratorium May 19, 1976 to the all-out expansion desired by Mayor Drapeau. Tenders were frozen, including those of Line 2 after Snowdon and those of Line 5 whose works were yet already underway. A struggle then ensued between the MUC and the Government of Quebec as any extension could not be done without the agreement of both parties. The Montreal Transportation Office may have {{tried to put the}} government in front of a <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> by awarding large contracts to build the tunnel between Namur station and Bois-Franc just before the moratorium entry into force.|$|E
25|$|Argetoianu {{soon became}} noted for his anti-communist stance: he carried out arrests of those Socialist Party members who, during their party's {{congress}} in May 1921, supported a maximalist platform and {{voted in favor}} of aligning their Socialist-Communist faction (future Communist Party of Romania) with the Comintern, citing the latter's condemnation of Greater Romania (all those arrested were prosecuted in the Dealul Spirii Trial). Argetoianu later stated that the arrest lacked legal grounds, and indicated that he purposely gave the Socialist Gheorghe Cristescu approval to hold the congress as a means to incriminate the faction. Faced with mixed reactions inside the cabinet (Averescu hesitated, while the Minister of Justice Grigore Trancu-Iași refused to give him support), he ordered the move without his fellow ministers' prior knowledge, and thus faced them with a <b>fait</b> <b>accompli.</b>|$|E
25|$|Polish {{chief of}} state Józef Piłsudski ordered his subordinate, General Lucjan Żeligowski, {{to stage a}} mutiny with his 1st Lithuanian–Belarusian Division (16 battalions with 14,000 soldiers) in Lida and capture Vilnius in <b>fait</b> <b>accompli.</b> The {{rebellion}} had two main goals: capture Vilnius and preserve Polish international reputation. The League of Nations was mediating other Polish disputes, notably over the Free City of Danzig and Upper Silesia, and direct aggression against Lithuania could have hampered Polish bargaining positions. While the Polish side officially held Żeligowski to be a deserter and did not support him, Poland provided logistic support, including munitions and food rations, to his units. Żeligowski also received reinforcements, when, according to the official version, the mutiny spread further among the Polish troops. His initial attack was secured on both sides by two Polish Armies.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{founding}} was {{symbolized by}} Galt felling a tree on St. George's Day, April 23, 1827, the feast {{day of the}} patron saint of England. The name Guelph comes from the Italian Guelfo and the Bavarian-Germanic Welf. It is a reference to the reigning British monarch at the time Guelph was founded, King George IV, whose family was from the House of Hanover, a younger branch of the House of Welf sometimes spelled as Guelf or Gwelf. The town was named to honour Britain's royal family, the Hanoverians, who were descended from the Guelfs, the ancestral family of George IV, the reigning British monarch; thus the nickname The Royal City. The directors of the Canada Company had actually wanted the city to be named Goderich, because Lord Goderich had helped form the company, but reluctantly accepted the <b>fait</b> <b>accompli.</b>|$|E
25|$|Germany's {{policy was}} {{to support a}} swift war to destroy Serbia that would present a <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> to the world. Unlike the three earlier cases dating from 1912 when Austria had asked for German {{diplomatic}} support for a war against Serbia, {{this time it was}} felt that political conditions for such a war now existed. At this time, the German military supported the idea of an Austrian attack against Serbia as the best way of starting a general war, whereas Wilhelm believed that an Austro-Serbian war would be purely local. Austrian policy based upon pre-existing plans to destroy Serbia involved not waiting to complete judicial inquiries to strike back immediately and not to strain its credibility in the coming weeks as it would become more and more clear that Austria was not reacting to the assassination. Likewise, Germany wished to give the impression of its ignorance of Austrian intentions.|$|E
25|$|May {{asserted}} that in Paris, London and other capitals, {{there was an}} inability to believe that someone might want another world war. He wrote that, given public reluctance to contemplate another war and a need to reach consensus about Germany, the rulers of France and Britain were reticent (to take a stand against German aggression), which limited dissent {{at the cost of}} enabling assumptions that suited their convenience. In France, Édouard Daladier withheld information until the last moment, and then presented the Munich Agreement to the French cabinet as a <b>fait</b> <b>accompli</b> in September 1938, thus avoiding discussions over whether Britain would follow France into war or if the military balance was really in Germany's favour or how significant it was. The decision for war in September 1939 and the plan devised in the winter of 1939–1940 by Daladier for war with the USSR followed the same pattern.|$|E
25|$|The plot of Cecilia {{revolves}} around the heroine, Cecilia Beverley, whose inheritance from her uncle comes with the stipulation that she find a husband who will accept her name. Beset on all sides by would-be suitors, the beautiful and intelligent Cecilia's heart is captivated by a man whose family's pride in its birth and ancestry would forbid the only son-and-heir's change of name. This young man finally persuades Cecilia, against all her good judgement, to agree to marry him secretly, so that their union – and the consequent change of name – can {{be presented to the}} family as a <b>fait</b> <b>accompli.</b> The work received praise for the mature tone of its ironic third-person narration, but was viewed as less spontaneous than her first work, and weighed down by the author's self-conscious awareness of her audience. Some critics claim to have found the narration intrusive, while some of her friends found the writing too closely modelled on Johnson's. Edmund Burke greatly admired the novel, but moderated his praise with criticism of the enormous array of characters and tangled, convoluted plots.|$|E
25|$|Al-Tabari {{reports that}} al-Mahdi {{was just about}} to promote Harun as heir {{apparent}} ahead of Musa when he died, and adds by way of corroboration another report that al-Mahdi set off for Masabadhan in a great hurry. However, it may be doubted that al-Mahdi at the time shared the reporter's subsequent knowledge of his imminent demise there, and none of the other reported circumstances of his death suggest that he was in a hurry to go anywhere. On the contrary, the sources in general make it clear that he had gone to Masabadhan for recreation, and they occasionally say so explicitly. Al-Tabari does say explicitly that envoys were sent to the provinces, where they obtained the oath of allegiance not only to al-Hadi as caliph but also to Harun as heir apparent (wali l-'ahd) (38). This was probably the first occasion on which Harun was so acknowledged. Harun himself, with the advice of al-Rabi', sent out these envoys, and all of this must have been presented to his brother on his return as a <b>fait</b> <b>accompli.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kül-chor and his faction {{allied with}} the Chinese general Gai Jiayun against Suluk's son and successor, Kut-chor, or Tuhuoxian in Chinese sources. Aided by his Transoxianian allies from Ishkand, Shash and Ferghana, in 739 Kül-chor {{defeated}} and captured his rival at Suyab. Soon after, Kül-chor was acclaimed as khagan and Kut-chor was put to death. Already {{from the beginning of}} his reign, Kül-chor's relation with his Chinese overlords was strained, as the Chinese court supported a candidate of its own, Ashina Xin, for the khaganate. In the event, Kül-chor drove off Ashina Xin and assumed the khaganate, forcing the Chinese to recognize the <b>fait</b> <b>accompli.</b> Soon however Kül-chor broke with the Chinese altogether, and in 742 he had Ashina Xin assassinated. As a result, in 744 the Chinese general Fumeng Lingcha campaigned against Kül-chor, defeated and executed him. After this, Turgesh power continued to decline amid internecine warfare, until, in 766, the Qarluqs killed the last Turgesh khagans and supplanted them as masters of the region of Semirechye.|$|E
