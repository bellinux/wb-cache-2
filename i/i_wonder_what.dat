25|$|Ian Chappell... made {{it clear}} more than once that he {{regarded}} the control of his side on the field as the concern solely of the umpires. Poor wretched men! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> Ian thought might have happened if either Tom Brooks or Robin Bailhache had applied the full sanction of Law 46, and had banned either Lillee or Thomson on that emotion-charged Sunday afternoon. How many beer-cans might have bespattered the field, and angry spectators invaded the playing area? As it was the umpires contented themselves with friendly warnings afterwards described as 'unofficial'. In the circumstances {{it was hard to}} blame them.|$|E

Following his death, Louise had a nervous breakdown and suffered from intense loneliness, writing to a friend shortly afterwards: [...] "My loneliness without the Duke is quite terrible. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> he does now!" ...|$|E

[...] "That's when I started to look around and I looked in some properties, and then I thought, 'Wait a minute. Nancy Drew. Hardy Boys.

500|$|Trumble {{was known}} for his cleverness on the field. C. B. Fry said of him, [...] "He is the most long-headed, observant and acute judge of the game, a perfect master of the whole art of placing fieldsmen and {{changing}} bowlers." [...] On one occasion when captaining his state side, Victoria, he deliberately bowled two wides that his fieldsmen allowed to roll to the boundary to score four runs for his opponents. This was done to save his tired bowlers from having to bowl again immediately, as his opponents would have been required to follow-on (bat twice in a row), at the time compulsory. When questioned by an onlooker about the dubious sportsmanship of the action, he replied, [...] "I had to do it, old chap, but <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> my father will think of it?" [...] Trumble was respected by his teammates and opponents; New Zealand cricketer, Dan Reese, who played against and alongside Trumble said, [...] "His subtle humour, his fund of cricket stories, his kindness, and, above all, his judgment, made him a man of exceptional character." ...|$|E
500|$|The rivalry {{intensified}} {{following the}} arrival of Arsène Wenger in October 1996. A league match {{between the two sides}} in February 1997 was marred by an incident between Arsenal's Ian Wright and United's Peter Schmeichel; the striker challenged for the ball with both feet and caught the goalkeeper with his studs. A confrontation ensued and police stepped in to keep the players apart after the final whistle. Wright's behaviour was scrutinised at a hearing, where he complained he was subject to racial abuse by Schmeichel, at which point the FA intervened and met with representatives of both clubs. In April 1997, Wright and Schmeichel settled their differences, but the managers' animosity towards each other started to become apparent. Wenger had advised against the Premier League extending the season to ease Manchester United's fixture congestion, to which Ferguson publicly retorted: [...] "Maybe he should concentrate on Ian Wright's tackles rather than Manchester United. He's at a big club, well Arsenal used to be a big club, and maybe next year he could be in the same situation. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> is story will be then." ...|$|E
500|$|Since Valene, I’ve {{tried to}} do {{anything}} and everything but play a goody-two-shoes. I love Val, I adore her. But I spent a total of 15 years—if you count the first year I played her on Dallas. That was quite an investment for me as an actress. If you were playing a goody-two-shoes today, the tabloid media would be dying to catch you on a bad day. [...] Look at what they’ve done to Tiger Woods. Look at what they’ve done to that man. My feeling is his father—or the absence of his father in his life—is (the root of) what’s going on with Tiger and that marriage. But the media won’t leave him alone. No matter who you are, (the celebrity coverage) is obsessive and constant. It’s hurtful. For me, if they show my face in a bad photo, they latch into me hook, line and sinker. Even Entertainment Tonight now has blood on their hands. It's brutal. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> they’ll do with Alec Baldwin now. He was my brother on Knots. They really threw him under a bus (when endlessly publicizing his infamous voice-mail rant against daughter Ireland, then 11, in 2007). He loves that child so much." ...|$|E

500|$|The Japanese {{name of the}} series, , became officially romanized as New Super Android Cutey Honey or New Cutey Honey. It {{has also}} been spelled with [...] "Cutie" [...] instead of [...] "Cutey". Unlike the {{original}} Cutie Honey, the series is an [...] "OVA" [...] (original video animation), one made for home video formats such as VHS tape. OVAs {{are known for their}} higher quality than anime television series, and Toei felt the new Honey was especially high-quality because (according to them) each episode used ten thousand cels, three times the usual number. By November 1994, series planner Naoko Takahashi said that Honey was tentatively set to last twelve episodes, with more to be considered later, but the series was cut short at the eighth episode, released in late November 1995. [...] Several scenes in that episode have unshaded foregrounds, partly drawn characters with missing legs, or both. A script for a planned ninth episode was produced as a drama CD voiced by the series' original voice actors. Its English dub, made by ADV Films in 1998, features Jessica Calvello, who was hand-picked by Nagai to perform the voice of Honey. In a post at the Anime on DVD forums, voice actor and writer George Manley—who has worked for the Houston-based ADV—praised both Neya and Calvello's work in Honey as examples of [...] "impressive" [...] performances, and said that the series, whose dub was released four years before he began voice work, [...] "was the title, and I often admit this, that brought me back to watching anime and started me on a long road to, 'Wow, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> might happen if I moved to Houston....|$|E
500|$|The kiss {{generated}} strong {{reaction from}} {{the media and the}} celebrities alike. Nekesa Mumbi Moody from Associated Press deduced [...] "Twenty years after the first MTV Video Music Awards, and not much has changed — Madonna still makes jaws drop and cheeks blush." [...] Brian Hiatt from Entertainment Weekly felt that [...] "The close-up of [...] locking lips with the 21-year-old Spears was an indelible MTV moment — sexy, vaguely transgressive, and as meaningless as it was entertaining." [...] Elysa Gardner from USA Today explained that the performance [...] "offered a poignant reminder of MTV's role in defining a youth culture that {{has become something of a}} tease — winking at convention without offering any fresh alternatives." [...] The MTV producers were skeptical, saying that [...] "It was sensational, but <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> the good folk in places like Provo, Utah state, would make of it. Middle America is not gonna let this one go lightly." [...] When asked about it, Madonna revealed, [...] "I am kissing [...] and passing my energy on to her. Like kind of a mythological fairytale." [...] The performance was listed by Blender magazine as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history. MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of the MTV Video Music Awards. In Madonna's 2004 Re-Invention World Tour, a remix interlude of [...] "Hollywood" [...] featured a breakdancer, a firedancer, a bellydancer, a tapdancer, and a skateboarder. The screens displayed animations of tarot cards. The performance was included in the I'm Going to Tell You a Secret live album and documentary. On the same tour, the performance of [...] "Into the Groove" [...] contained samples from the remix [...] "Into the Hollywood Groove".|$|E
500|$|Madonna herself {{would later}} say: [...] "I wouldn't say I regret it. I've made {{mistakes}} and learned from them. Most {{people want to}} hear me say that I regret publishing my Sex book. I don't. What was the problem was releasing my Erotica album at the same time. I love that album and it got overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going to see it and go, 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I think there was a little bit of a moralistic sort of 'I'll teach you how to be free!' – and that bothered the hell out of me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Working class militants were seizing on the {{popularity}} of gorillas (which were now appearing in travelling menageries) to trumpet man's monkey origins. To crush these ideas, Richard Owen as President-elect of the Royal Association announced his authoritative anatomical studies of primate brains showing that humans were not just a separate species, but a separate sub-class.

His first priority was {{to undo the}} damage caused by the harsh 1919 Treaty of Versailles, by settling the reparations issue and coming to terms with Germany.

Most people are not aware of this, but we all know subconsciously not to use the reduced form here. How did we come to this?
