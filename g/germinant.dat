Spore germination is triggered by specific molecules called germinants, which are thought to act by binding to and stimulating spore receptors. Three homologous operons, gerA, gerB, and gerK, were previously proposed to encode <b>germinant</b> receptors because inactivating mutations in those genes confer a germinant-specific defect in germination. To more definitely identify genes that encode <b>germinant</b> receptors, we isolated mutants whose spores germinated in the novel <b>germinant</b> d-alanine, because such mutants would likely contain gain-of-function mutations in genes that encoded preexisting <b>germinant</b> receptors. Three independent mutants were isolated, and in each case the mutant phenotype was shown to result from a single dominant mutation in the gerB operon. Two of the mutations altered the gerBA gene, whereas the third affected the gerBB gene. These results suggest that gerBA and gerBB encode components of the <b>germinant</b> receptor. Furthermore, genetic interactions between the wild-type gerB and the mutant gerBA and gerBB alleles suggested that the <b>germinant</b> receptor might be a complex containing GerBA, GerBB, and probably other proteins. Thus, we propose that the gerB operon encodes at least two components of a multicomponent <b>germinant</b> receptor...|$|E
40|$|Germination of dormant spores of Bacillus {{species is}} {{initiated}} when nutrient germinants bind to <b>germinant</b> receptors in spores ’ inner membrane and this interaction triggers the re-lease of dipicolinic acid and cations from the spore core and their replacement by water. Ba-cillus subtilis spores contain three functional <b>germinant</b> receptors encoded by the gerA, gerB, and gerK operons. The GerA <b>germinant</b> receptor alone triggers germination with L-va-line or L-alanine, and the GerB and GerK <b>germinant</b> receptors together trigger germination {{with a mixture}} of L-asparagine, D-glucose, D-fructose and KCl (AGFK). Recently, it was re-ported that the B. subtilis gerW gene is expressed only during sporulation in developing spores, and that GerW is essential for L-alanine germination of B. subtilis spores but not for germination with AGFK. However, we now find that loss of the B. subtilis gerW gene had no significant effects on: i) rates of spore germination with L-alanine; ii) spores ’ levels of germi-nation proteins including GerA <b>germinant</b> receptor subunits; iii) AGFK germination; iv) spore germination by <b>germinant</b> receptor-independent pathways; and v) outgrowth of germinated spores. Studies in Bacillus megaterium did find that gerW was expressed in the developing spore during sporulation, and in a temperature-dependent manner.

Thereafter, with minimal reinforcement, avoidance was maintained at 90 to 99 percent for 6 months. In six field trials in Washington, Oregon, and California, areas seeded with 2 percent mestranol-treated Douglas-fir seed yielded 1. 6 to 5. 9 times more <b>germinants</b> than areas seeded with control seed.

40|$|The extreme {{metabolic}} dormancy {{and resistance}} properties of spores formed {{by members of}} the Bacillus and Clostridium genera are lost upon exposure to a variety of small-molecule <b>germinants.</b> <b>Germinants</b> are known to interact in an as yet undefined manner with cognate receptor complexes that reside in the inner membrane that surrounds the spore protoplast. The receptor itself is a complex of at least three proteins, and in this study we identify amino acid residues, predicted to lie in loop regions of GerVB on the exterior aspect of the membrane, that influence the Bacillus megaterium spore germination response. Three consecutive residues adjacent to putative transmembrane domain 10 (TM 10) were demonstrated to mediate to various degrees the proline germinative response while also influencing germination in response to leucine, glucose, and inorganic salts, suggesting that this region may be part of a ligand binding pocket. Alternatively, substitutions in this region may affect the conformation of associated functionally important TM regions. Leucine- and KBr-mediated germination was also influenced by substitutions in other outer loop regions. These observations, when considered with accompanying kinetic analyses that demonstrate cooperativity between <b>germinants,</b> suggest that binding sites for the respective <b>germinants</b> are in close spatial proximity in the receptor but do not overlap.

Spores of C. botulinum can survive mild food processing treatments and subsequently germinate, multiply, produce toxin and cause botulism.

However, {{little is known about the}} process of spore germination in group II C. botulinum (gIICb), which are a major concern in chilled foods because they are psychrotrophic. The classical model of spore germination states that germination is triggered by the binding of a <b>germinant</b> molecule to a cognate <b>germinant</b> receptor. Remarkably, unlike many other sporeformers, gIICb has only one predicted canonical <b>germinant</b> receptor although it responds to multiple germinants. Therefore, we deleted the gerBAC locus that encodes this <b>germinant</b> receptor to determine its role in germination. Surprisingly, the deletion did not affect germination by any of the nutrient germinants, nor by the non-nutrient dodecylamine. We conclude that one or more other, so far unidentified, <b>germinant</b> receptors must be responsible for nutrient induced germination in gIICb. Furthermore, the gerBAC locus was strongly conserved with intact open reading frames in 159 gIICb genomes, suggesting that it has nevertheless an important function. status: publishe...|$|E

Upon entry into a host, endospores rapidly differentiate into vegetative bacilli {{through the process}} of germination, thus initiating anthrax. Elucidation of the signals that trigger germination and the receptors that recognize them is critical to understanding the pathogenesis of B. anthracis. Individual mutants deficient in each of the seven putative <b>germinant</b> receptor-encoding loci were constructed via temperature-dependent, plasmid insertion mutagenesis and used to correlate these receptors with known <b>germinant</b> molecules. These analyses showed that the GerK and GerL receptors are jointly required for the alanine germination pathway and also are individually required for recognition of either proline and methionine (GerK) or serine and valine (GerL) as cogerminants in combination with inosine. The <b>germinant</b> specificity of GerS was refined from a previous study in a nonisogenic background since it was required only for germination in response to aromatic amino acid cogerminants. The gerA and gerY loci were found to be dispensable for recognition of all known <b>germinant</b> molecules. In addition, we show that the promoter of each putative <b>germinant</b> receptor operon, except that of the gerA locus, is active during sporulation.

In the Carrizo Plain of California, the invasive grass Hordeum murinum has {{become the focus of}} management because it threatens native grassland species. Previous studies have illustrated how resource availability and burrowing herbivore activity affect the growth of this grass, but more information on its germination is needed in order to obtain a full picture of its population dynamics. Seedbank samples were collected in different field conditions and then brought into the greenhouse to assess germination. Experimental field manipulations allowed evaluation of Hordeum germination in response to Giant Kangaroo Rat (Dipodomys ingens) burrowing and foraging activity, precipitation, and plant community cover. Presence of burrowing and increased precipitation resulted in an increase in the abundance of Hordeum <b>germinants.</b> The presence of Giant Kangaroo Rat foraging activity increased the abundance of Hordeum <b>germinants</b> across seasons. In addition, more Hordeum <b>germinants</b> grew when this trophic activity was absent and after an entire summer of dormancy had passed, which leads to further questions regarding seed conditioning. Relative abundance of Hordeum <b>germinants</b> had a linear, negative relationship with total plant cover in the field, suggesting competitive effects of the plant community on germination.

C. botulinum spores exposed to 100 mM L-alanine or L-cysteine at pH 4. 5 remained sensitive to D-amino acid inhibition at pH 7, indicating that no germinants had bound to the trigger site at pH 4. 5.

These superdormant spores did not germinate with the initial nutrients or those that stimulated other <b>germinant</b> receptors, and the superdormant spores' defect was not genetic. The superdormant spores did, however, germinate with Ca 2 +-dipicolinic acid or dodecylamine. Although these superdormant spores did not germinate {{with high levels of}} nutrients that activated one or two nutrient <b>germinant</b> receptors, they germinated with nutrient mixtures that activated more receptors, and using high levels of nutrient mixtures activating more <b>germinant</b> receptors decreased superdormant spore yields. The use of moderate nutrient levels to isolate superdormant spores increased their yields; the resultant spores germinated poorly with the initial moderate nutrient concentrations, but they germinated well with high nutrient concentrations. These findings suggest that the levels of superdormant spores in populations depend on the germination conditions used, with fewer superdormant spores isolated when better germination conditions are used. These findings further suggest that superdormant spores require an increased signal for triggering spore germination compared to most spores in populations. One factor determining whether a spore is superdormant is its level of <b>germinant</b> receptors, since spore populations with higher levels of <b>germinant</b> receptors yielded lower levels of superdormant spores.

This synergism was also not seen between the <b>germinant</b> l-valine, which acts via a GR, and the <b>germinant</b> dodecylamine, which does not act via any GR. These results indicate that spores not only integrate but can also amplify signals from multiple germinants and multiple GRs in determining rates of commitment and overall spore germination. This amplification can be explained by a simple mechanism in which a single signal integrator triggers germination above an accumulation threshold. Direct cooperative action between GRs may further add to the synergism seen in germination triggered by multiple GRs. Further experiments and modeling are required to determine the relative contributions of these different mechanisms...|$|E

Experiments at the Bernard Field Station in Claremont, CA and germinator trials in a controlled environment were used to examine the survivorship and germination rate of three native forbs in the presence or absence of invasive grass competition. Germinator trials revealed that most Clarkia purpurea seeds germinated in fall conditions, though newer seeds had higher proportions germinate under winter conditions. Older seeds had a lower germination success, indicating a potential decrease in seed viability. In the field experiment, November <b>germinants</b> had higher survival rates than October <b>germinants</b> for Amsinckia menziesii and Phacelia distans, and both species had similar numbers of new <b>germinants</b> at each census. Removal of invasive grasses did not significantly affect the survival of either species, though a trend towards increased survivorship was observed in removal plots of November <b>germinants.</b> Taken together, these results show evidence for variation in germination timing and responses to environmental cues among native annual seeds, and also support the idea that germination timing has important consequences for survivorship, and potentially competitive interactions, with invasive grasses...|$|R

However, spores of strain PV 361, a plasmidless QMB 1551 deriv-ative that lacks the GerU <b>germinant</b> receptor (GR) responsible for mediating germination in response to single-trigger com-pounds, can germinate efficiently when incubated in nutritionally rich media, presumably via activation of additional <b>germinant</b> receptors. In this work, we have identified five chromosomally encoded GRs and attempted to characterize, by mutational analy-sis, <b>germinant</b> recognition profiles associated with the respective receptors in strain PV 361. Of strains engineered with single GR insertion-deletions, only GerK-null spores displayed significant defective germination phenotypes when incubated in 5 % (wt/ vol) beef extract or plated on rich solid medium. Cumulative decreases in viability were observed in GerK-null spores that also lacked GerA or GerA 2, indicating that these GRs, which exerted little effect on spore germination when disrupted individually, have a degree of functionality. Unexpectedly, an efficient germination response to combinations of germinants was restored in GerA spores, which lack all other functional GRs, providing evidence for negative cooperativity between some GRs within the spore. Tetrazolium-based germinative assays conducted with purified spores indicated that these newly characterized B. megate-riumGRs are cognate for a wide and chemically diverse range of <b>germinant</b> molecules, but unlike GerU, can only be induced to trigger germination when stimulated by at least two different germinants.

Insertional inactivation of this B. cereus gene, named gerN, did not affect vegetative growth or sporulation. The null mutant spores were 30 -fold slower to germinate in inosine (5 mM) but germinated almost normally in response to l-alanine (10 mM).

Early-stage development of Z. muelleri was examined under various salinity, temperature and light conditions using a fully factorial design. We found that germination rates declined significantly with increasing salinity, with the greatest germination occurring in treatments subjected to 24 -h darkness at either 15 or 20 °C. Hypocotyl hair initiation was influenced by both temperature and salinity. Seeds which germinated at 20 °C in 24 -h darkness had significantly more <b>germinants</b> developing hypocotyl hairs than the other treatments. Although the initiation of hypocotyl hairs was generally greater under higher salinity concentrations, <b>germinants</b> subjected to lower salinity conditions had a greater likelihood of developing fully extended hypocotyl hairs. Based on our results, freshwater pulses that occur shortly after seed maturation could initiate year round germination in temperate regions. Furthermore, <b>germinants</b> stored at salinities of less than 16 ppt showed greater elongation of hypocotyl hairs, indicating such pulses would also aid in the development of these structures.

40|$|Tropical {{rainforest}} rehabilitation is {{one method}} to recreate, establish, and accelerate natural successional processes. Tropical rehabilitation has {{occurred on the}} Atherton Tableland for 15 years. Currently, rehabilitated sites on the Atherton Tableland are monitored by tree planting agencies {{for two to three}} years to reduce exotic species. The 10 - 12 years following the last monitoring period provides the opportunity to investigate successional processes of these rehabilitated sites. One method to investigate rehabilitation management is through the soil seed bank. The composition and recruitment pattern of seeds in the soil seed bank may offer information on species that have the potential to germinate in rehabilitated sites following a disturbance. This knowledge is useful to predict future successional patterns within rehabilitated sites. This study investigated the soil seed bank composition of rehabilitated sites adjacent to – and isolated from – remnant rainforest. In addition, it was determined whether distance from seed source influenced exotic species composition and native species recruitment that occurred to rehabilitated sites. Seventeen rainforest study sites were chosen for investigation: six remnant rainforest sites, six rehabilitated sites adjacent to remnant rainforest, and five rehabilitated sites isolated from remnant rainforest. Twenty soil samples were collected (60 x 60 x 50 mm deep) for each site, and overstorey plant species were recorded. Germination of soil-stored seeds occurred for three months, and seedling identification occurred on a weekly to fortnightly basis. Following species identification, life history traits were collected including: origin (native or exotic), life form, dispersal mechanism, seed size, successional stage, and whether species were recruited to the rehabilitated sites. Non-parametric tests, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to determine whether differences occurred between sites in number of seeds, number of species, or life history traits. Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient identified positive and negative associations among life history traits. A total of 10, 938 seeds germinated from the 17 study sites, and 10, 226 were exotic. Exotics represented 328 <b>germinants</b> and 40 species of remnant rainforest sites; 4, 864 <b>germinants</b> and 34 species of adjacent rehabilitated sites; and 5, 034 <b>germinants</b> and 31 species of isolated rehabilitated sites. There {{were no significant differences in}} number of exotic seeds and species between the adjacent and isolated rehabilitated sites, which indicate that distance from seed source did not affect the exotic composition of rehabilitated sites. The exotic species found in the soil seed banks were herbs and grasses. Herbs and grasses had a significant positive correlation with wind dispersal, small sized seeds, and early successional species. A total of 238 seeds were native recruits. Native recruits represented 120 <b>germinants</b> and 20 species of remnant rainforest sites, 33 <b>germinants</b> and 5 species of adjacent rehabilitated sites, and 85 <b>germinants</b> and 4 species of isolated rehabilitated sites. There were no significant differences in native recruit <b>germinants</b> among the remnant rainforest sites, the adjacent rehabilitated sites and the isolated rehabilitated sites; however, there were significant differences in the number of native species recruited between the three rainforest site types. There were significantly more species recruited to the remnant rainforest sites than the adjacent rehabilitated sites. However, the results indicate that location of rehabilitation planting (adjacent or isolated) does not affect native species recruitment. The native recruited species were shrubs and trees. There was a significant positive association between life form and wind dispersal, small sized seeds, and early successional stage. The soil seed bank composition suggests that 10 – 12 years following weed control, exotic species may germinate after a disturbance and establish the rehabilitated sites.

Phylogenetic analysis of the <b>germinant</b> receptor encoding operons of the enterotoxic strains B. cereus ATCC 14579 and ATCC 10987, the emetic strain AH 187, and the psychrotolerant strain Bacillus weihenstephanensis KBAB 4, indicated {{a core group of}} five <b>germinant</b> receptor operons to be present in the four strains, with each strain containing one to three additional receptors. Using quantitative PCR, induction of expression during sporulation was confirmed for all identified <b>germinant</b> receptor operons in these strains. Despite the large overlap in receptors, diversity in amino acid-induced germination capacity was observed, with six out of 20 amino acids, serving as germinants for spores of all four strains. Each strain showed unique features: efficient germination of strain KBAB 4 spores required non-inducing amounts of inosine as the co-germinant, strain ATCC 10987 spores germinated only efficiently after heat activation. Furthermore, strain ATCC 14579 and AH 187 spores germinated without heat activation or inosine, with strain ATCC 14579 spores being triggered by all amino acids except phenylalanine and strain AH 187 spores being specifically triggered efficiently only by phenylalanine. Analysis of all germination data did not reveal strict linkages between specific germinants and <b>germinant</b> receptors. Finally, the diversity in nutrient-induced germination capacity was also reflected in the diverse germination responses of heat-activated spores of the four B. cereus strains in food matrices, such as milk, rice water and meat bouillon, indicating that amino acid composition and/or availability of inosine are important germination determinants in foods.

40|$|Spores of Bacillus subtilis lacking all <b>germinant</b> receptors {{germinate}} > 500 -fold {{slower than}} wild-type spores in nutrients {{and were not}} induced to germinate by a pressure of 100 MPa. However, a pressure of 550 MPa induced germination of spores lacking all <b>germinant</b> receptors {{as well as of}} receptorless spores lacking either of the two lytic enzymes essential for cortex hydrolysis during germination. Complete germination of spores either lacking both cortex-lytic enzymes or with a cortex not attacked by these enzymes was not induced by a pressure of 550 MPa, but treatment of these mutant spores with this pressure caused the release of dipicolinic acid. These data suggest the following conclusions: (i) a pressure of 100 MPa induces spore germination by activating the <b>germinant</b> receptors; and (ii) a pressure of 550 MPa opens channels for release of dipicolinic acid from the spore core, which leads to the later steps in spore germination...|$|E
40|$|The {{rates of}} {{germination}} of Bacillus subtilis spores with l-alanine were increased markedly, in particular at low l-alanine concentrations, by overexpression of the tricistronic gerA operon that encodes the spore's <b>germinant</b> receptor for l-alanine {{but not by}} overexpression of gerA operon homologs encoding receptors for other germinants. However, spores with elevated levels of the GerA proteins did not germinate more rapidly {{in a mixture of}} asparagine, glucose, fructose, and K+ (AGFK), a <b>germinant</b> combination that requires the participation of at least the <b>germinant</b> receptors encoded by the tricistronic gerB and gerK operons. Overexpression of the gerB or gerK operon or both the gerB and gerK operons also did not stimulate spore germination in AGFK. Overexpression of a mutant gerB operon, termed gerB*, that encodes a receptor allowing spore germination in response to either d-alanine or l-asparagine also caused faster spore germination with these germinants, again with the largest enhancement of spore germination rates at lower <b>germinant</b> concentrations. However, the magnitudes of the increases in the germination rates with d-alanine or l-asparagine in spores overexpressing gerB* were well below the increases in the spore's levels of the GerBA protein. Germination of gerB* spores with d-alanine or l-asparagine did not require participation of the products of the gerK operon, but germination with these agents was decreased markedly in spores also overexpressing gerA. These findings suggest that (i) increases in the levels of <b>germinant</b> receptors that respond to single germinants can increase spore germination rates significantly; (ii) there is some maximum rate of spore germination above which stimulation of GerA operon receptors alone will not further increase the rate of spore germination, as action of some protein other than the <b>germinant</b> receptors can become rate limiting; (iii) while previous work has shown that the wild-type GerB and GerK receptors interact in some fashion to cause spore germination in AGFK, there also appears to be an additional component required for AGFK-triggered spore germination; (iv) activation of the GerB receptor with d-alanine or l-asparagine can trigger spore germination independently of the GerK receptor; and (v) {{it is likely that the}} different <b>germinant</b> receptors interact directly and/or compete with each other for some additional component needed for initiation of spore germination. We also found that very high levels of overexpression of the gerA or gerK operon (but not the gerB or gerB* operon) in the forespore blocked sporulation shortly after the engulfment stage, although sporulation appeared normal with the lower levels of gerA or gerK overexpression that were used to generate spores for analysis of rates of germination...|$|E

Conditions {{affecting}} Bacillus megaterium spore germination in glucose or various nitrogenous compounds. J. Bacteriol. 83 : 1231 – 1237. 1962. —The {{possibility that}} {{there is more than one}} metabolic pathway for triggering germination of Bacillus megaterium spores was investigated. Spores were germinated in seven different “physiological germinants” under varying conditions of concentration, pH, combinations of <b>germinants,</b> temperature before and during germination, and chemical inhibition. l-Alanine and l-valine appear to induce germination via the same metabolic pathway (same inhibitors are effective, similar germination rate and temperature requirements); and glucose and glucosamine also appear to act similarly, but by a different pathway than l-alanine and l-valine. The other <b>germinants,</b> l-leucine, l-proline, and KNO 3, do not correspond in all respects either to the glucose-glucosamine or to the alanine-valine pair in response to the different germination conditions.

40|$|Declines in cottonwood (Populus spp.) {{recruitment}} along alluvial {{reaches of}} large rivers in arid {{regions of the}} western United States {{have been attributed to}} modified flow regimes, lack of suitable substrate, insufficient seed rain, and increased interspecific competition. We evaluated whether and how these factors were operating during 1993 – 1996 to influence demographics of Fremont cottonwood (P. deltoides Marshall subsp. wislizenii (Watson) Eckenwalder) along reaches of the Green and Yampa Rivers near their confluence in northwestern Colorado. We examined seedling establishment, defined as survival through three growing seasons, at three alluvial reaches that differed primarily in the level of flow regulation: a site on the unregulated Yampa, an upper Green River site regulated by Flaming Gorge Dam, and a lower Green River site below the Green–Yampa confluence. Seed rain was abundant in all sites, and led to large numbers of <b>germinants</b> (first-year seedlings) appearing each year at all sites. The regulated flow in the upper Green River reach restricted germination to islands and cut banks that were later inundated or eroded; no seedlings survived there. Mortality at the lower Green River site was due largely to desiccation or substrate erosion; 23 % of 1993 <b>germinants</b> survived their first growing season, but at most 2 % survived through their second. At the Yampa River site, <b>germinants</b> appeared on vegetated and unvegetated surfaces up to 2. 5 m above base flow stage, but survived to autumn only on bare surfaces at least 1. 25 m above base flow stage, and where at least 10 of the uppe...|$|R

Although drupe size in teak is positively correlated with seedling growth much less is known about the combined effect of drupe size and time of emergence on the performance of the seedlings. The drupes were divided in 3 diameter categories (i. e. 9 - 12, 12 - 15 and 15 - 18 mm) and the number of <b>germinants</b> were weekly counted for four weeks. The resulted seedlings were planted in poly bags containing rooting medium of soil and sand (1 : 1 ratio). Results of the study indicated that the seedling emergence was largest during second week irrespective of drupe size. Seedlings from 15 - 18 mm diameter class drupes recorded the highest seedling attributes followed by 12 - 15 mm and 9 - 12 mm classes. However, net assimilation rate and relative growth rate were highest in the seedlings obtained from 9 - 12 mm class drupes. With a few exceptions, first week emergents recorded the highest seedling attributes followed by second, third and fourth week <b>germinants.</b> Cluster analysis of the seedling attributes identified the seedlings belonging to 15 - 18 mm drupe size and emerging during first week as superior. But, considering the largest number of drupes in 12 - 15 mm size class, peak germination during second week after sowing, price of planting stock and cost of nursery operation per unit of planting, second week <b>germinants</b> of 12 15 mm size drupes can also be recommended for raising seedlings in plantation programmes of teak. </span...|$|R
40|$|Nutrient-dependent {{germination}} of Bacillus anthracis spores is stimulated when receptors {{located in}} the inner membrane detect combinations of amino acid and purine nucleoside germinants. B. [*]anthracis produces five distinct <b>germinant</b> receptors, GerH, GerK, GerL, GerS and GerX. Otherwise isogenic mutant strains expressing {{only one of these}} receptors were created and tested for germination and virulence. The GerH receptor was necessary and sufficient for wild-type levels of germination with inosine-containing germinants in the absence of other receptors. GerK and GerL were sufficient for germination in 50 [*]mM L-alanine. When mutants were inoculated intratracheally, any receptor, except for GerX, was sufficient to allow for a fully virulent infection. In contrast, when inoculated subcutaneously only the GerH receptor was able to facilitate a fully virulent infection. These results suggest that route of infection determines <b>germinant</b> receptor requirements. A mutant lacking all five <b>germinant</b> receptors was also attenuated and exhibited a severe germination defect in vitro. Together, these data give us a greater understanding of the earliest moments of germination, and provide a more detailed picture of the signals required to stimulate this process...|$|E
40|$|Clostridium difficile spores must {{germinate}} in vivo {{to become}} actively growing bacteria {{in order to}} produce the toxins that are necessary for disease. C. difficile spores germinate in vitro in response to certain bile acids and glycine. In other sporulating bacteria, proteins embedded within the inner membrane of the spore sense the presence of germinants and trigger the release of Ca⁺⁺-dipicolinic acid (Ca⁺⁺-DPA) from the spore core and subsequent hydrolysis of the spore cortex, a specialized peptidoglycan. Based upon homology searches of known <b>germinant</b> receptors from other spore-forming bacteria, C. difficile likely uses unique mechanisms to recognize germinants. Here, we identify the germination-specific protease, CspC, as the C. difficile bile acid <b>germinant</b> receptor and show that bile acid-mediated germination is important for establishing C. difficile disease in the hamster model of infection. These results highlight the importance of bile acids in triggering in vivo germination and provide the first description of a C. difficile spore <b>germinant</b> receptor. Blocking the interaction of bile acids with the C. difficile spore may represent an attractive target for novel therapeutics...|$|E
40|$|Spore {{germination}} is {{the first}} step to Bacillus anthracis pathogenicity. Previous work has shown that B. anthracis spores use germination (Ger) receptors to recognize amino acids and nucleosides as germinants. Genetic analysis has putatively paired each individual Ger receptor with a specific <b>germinant.</b> However, Ger receptors {{seem to be able to}} partially compensate for each other and recognize alternative germinants. Using kinetic analysis of B. anthracis spores germinated with inosine and l-alanine, we previously determined kinetic parameters for this germination process and showed binding synergy between the cogerminants. In this work, we expanded our kinetic analysis to determine kinetic parameters and binding order for every B. anthracis spore <b>germinant</b> pair. Our results show that <b>germinant</b> binding can exhibit positive, neutral, or negative cooperativity. Furthermore, different germinants can bind spores by either a random or an ordered mechanism. Finally, simultaneous triggering of multiple germination pathways shows that germinants can either cooperate or interfere with each other during the spore germination process. We postulate that the complexity of germination responses may allow B. anthracis spores to respond to different environments by activating different germination pathways...|$|E
40|$|Aim of study: Uneven-aged (UEA) {{management}} systems can achieve multiple-use objectives, however, use of UEA techniques to manage longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) forests are still open to question, {{because of the}} species’ intolerance of competition. It was our aim to examine the influence of different levels (9. 2, 13. 8 and 18. 4 m 2 ha- 1) of residual basal area (RBA) on longleaf pine seedling survival and growth following three growing seasons. Area of study: This study was conducted at the Escambia Experimental Forest, located on the Southern Coastal Plain of Alabama, in the southeastern United States. Material and Methods: Selection silviculture was implemented with the Proportional-Basal Area (Pro-B) method. Prescribed burning was conducted before seed dispersal {{and in the second}} year after germination. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was measured under the canopy in the study plots. Survival and growth of longleaf pine seedlings were observed for three growing seasons. Main results: An inverse relationship was found between the number of <b>germinants</b> and RBA, but the mortality of <b>germinants</b> and planted seedlings was not affected by RBA. At age three, an inverse relationship was observed between root-collar diameter (RCD) growth of the <b>germinants</b> and RBA, but RCD growth of planted seedlings was not affected by RBA. Most of the study plots contained more than the projected number of seedlings needed to sustain the target diameter structure. Research highlights: Long-term continuous monitoring of seedling development and recruitment into canopy is required to determine the efficacy of UEA management. However, current data suggest that UEA methods may be a viable alternative to the use of even-aged (EA) methods in longleaf ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Fusarium {{species can}} cause {{damping-off}} and root rot of young conifer seedlings, resulting in severe crop and economic losses in forest nurseries. Disease control within tree nurseries {{is difficult because}} of the inability to characterize and quantify Fusarium spp. populations with regard to disease potential because of high variability in isolate virulence. Fusarium isolates were collected from healthy and diseased seedlings of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and western white pine (Pinus monticola) from a nursery in Idaho, USA. Molecular markers such as DNA sequences (mitochondrial small subunit and nuclear translation elongation factor 1 -alpha) and amplified fragment length polymorphism were used to identify isolates as either F. oxysporum or F. commune. In addition, diagnostic primers were developed to detect and distinguish F. commune from F. oxysporum. In vitro and greenhouse virulence tests were completed on Douglas-fir <b>germinants</b> and seedlings. For Douglas-fir <b>germinants</b> and seedlings, F. oxysporum isolates generally caused less severe symptoms, whereas most F. commune isolates caused mortality through damping-off.
