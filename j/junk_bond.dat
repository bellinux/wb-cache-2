5|$|A December 1988 audit by the FHLBB found Lincoln in {{violation}} of many regulations and in danger of default. The following month they ordered Keating to stop transferring cash from Lincoln to American Continental, which imperiled the latter's survival strategy and caused its stock price to nosedive. Keating tried to arrange <b>junk</b> <b>bond</b> deals with Michael Milken and place bets in the global currency markets to generate cash, but the moves failed and he lost $11 million in one month alone. Keating got Senators DeConcini and Cranston to pressure the regulators to let a sale go through, {{but this time the}} lawmakers were ignored.|$|E
5|$|Scaramanga then {{proposes a}} pistol duel with Bond on the beach; {{the two men}} stand back to back and are officiated by Nick Nack to take twenty paces, but when Bond turns and fires, Scaramanga has vanished. Nick Nack leads Bond into Scaramanga's Funhouse where Bond stands {{in the place of}} a {{mannequin}} of himself; when Scaramanga walks by, Bond outwits and kills him. Goodnight kills Scaramanga's security chief Kra, sending his body into one of the temperature control vats. His body heat raises the helium of the solar plant, which begins to spiral out of control. Bond retrieves the Solex unit just before the island is destroyed, and they escape unharmed in Scaramanga's Chinese <b>junk.</b> <b>Bond</b> then fends off a final attack by Nick Nack, who smuggled himself aboard, placing Nick Nack in a wicker basket on the mainmast of the ship. Bond and Goodnight celebrate their mission by romancing each other.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} financial innovation of the 1980 s was {{the emergence}} of original-issue <b>junk</b> <b>bonds,</b> securities of below investment grade with high initial yields to maturity.

25|$|Ivan Boesky was a Wall Street {{arbitrageur}} who had {{amassed a}} fortune of about $200 million by betting on corporate takeovers. He was {{investigated by the}} U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for making investments based on tips received from corporate insiders. These stock and options acquisitions were sometimes brazen, with massive purchases occurring {{only a few days}} before a corporation announced a takeover. Although insider trading of this kind was illegal, laws prohibiting it were rarely enforced until Boesky was prosecuted. Boesky cooperated with the SEC and informed on several others, including <b>junk</b> <b>bond</b> trader Michael Milken. Per agreement with Giuliani, Boesky received a -year prison sentence along with a $100 million fine. In 1989, Giuliani charged Milken under the RICO Act with 98 counts of racketeering and fraud. In a highly publicized case, Milken was indicted by a grand jury on these charges.|$|E
500|$|The {{dramatic}} increase in default rates among <b>junk</b> <b>bond</b> issuing companies. [...] The historical default rate for high yield bonds from 1978 to 1988 was approximately 2.2% of total issuance. [...] In 1989, defaults increased dramatically to 4.3% of the then $190 billion market and an additional 2.6% of issuance defaulted {{in the first half}} of 1990. [...] As a result of the higher perceived risk, the differential in yield of the <b>junk</b> <b>bond</b> market over U.S. treasuries (known as the [...] "spread") had also increased by 700 basis points (7 percentage points). [...] This made the cost of debt in the high yield market significantly more expensive than it had been previously. [...] The market shut down altogether for lower rated issuers.|$|E

5000|$|Corporate: Bonds {{are issued}} by corporations. All {{corporate}} bonds are {{guaranteed by the}} borrowing (issuing) company, and the risk depends on the company's ability to pay the loan at maturity. Some bond funds specialize in high-yield securities (<b>junk</b> <b>bonds),</b> which are corporate bonds carrying a higher risk, due to the potential inability of the issuer to repay the bond. Bond funds specializing in <b>junk</b> <b>bonds</b> - also known as [...] "below investment-grade bonds" [...] - pay higher dividends than other bond funds, with the dividend return correlating approximately with the risk.|$|R
500|$|Although buyout firms {{generally}} {{had different}} aims and methods, {{they were often}} lumped in with the [...] "corporate raiders" [...] who {{came on the scene}} in the 1980s. The raiders were best known for hostile bids—takeover attempts that were opposed by management. By contrast, private equity firms generally attempted to strike deals with boards and CEOs, though in many cases in the 1980s they allied with managements that were already under pressure from raiders. But both groups bought companies through leveraged buyouts; both relied heavily on <b>junk</b> <b>bond</b> financing; and under both types of owners in many cases major assets were sold, costs were slashed and employees were laid off. Hence, in the public mind, they were lumped together.|$|E
2500|$|Drexel Burnham Lambert {{was a major}} Wall Street {{investment}} banking firm which was forced into bankruptcy in February 1990 due to its involvement in illegal activities in the <b>junk</b> <b>bond</b> market, driven by Drexel employee Michael Milken.

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, public {{confidence}} in leveraged buyouts had waned, and criticism of the perceived engine of the takeover movement, the <b>junk</b> <b>bond,</b> had increased. Innovative financial instruments often generate skepticism, and few have generated more controversy than high yield debt. Some argue that the debt instrument itself, sometimes dubbed [...] "turbo debt," [...] was {{the cornerstone of the}} 1980s [...] "Decade of Greed." [...] However, junk bonds were actually used in less than 25% of acquisitions and hostile takeovers during that period. Nevertheless, by 1990 default rates on high yield debt had increased from 4% to 10%, further eroding confidence in this financial instrument. Without Milken's cheerleading, the liquidity of the <b>junk</b> <b>bond</b> market dried up. Drexel was forced to buy the bonds of insolvent and failing companies, which depleted their capital and would eventually bankrupt the company.|$|E

[...] With his facile explanations of complex financial terms and invigorating portraits of market speculators, The Takeover Game [...] "argues that the investment banks, motivated by huge fees, are {{the driving force}} behind the current merger mania usually to the detriment of the commonweal.

Independent tax experts stated that [...] "Whatever loophole existed was not ‘exploited’ here, but stretched beyond any recognition" [...] and that it involved [...] "sleight of hand". Since the taxes were related to the reduction in Trump's extensive <b>junk</b> <b>bond</b> debt at the time and the bankruptcies of three of Trump's casinos, the methods used were probably related, according to the report, to Trump's reported $916 million loss reported on his 1995 tax return.|$|E
