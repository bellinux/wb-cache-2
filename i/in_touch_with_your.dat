2500|$|Different {{scholars}} have varying interpretations for {{the concept of}} amanitvam, humility, as virtue in the Bhagwad Gita. For example, Prabhupada explains humility to mean one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but {{from the point of}} view of a man in perfect knowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. Jopson explains amanitvam, humility, as lack of arrogance and pride, and one of twenty six virtues in a human being that if perfected, leads one to a divine state of living and the ultimate truth. Eknath Easwaran writes that the Gita's subject is [...] "the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage if he or she is to emerge from life victorious", and [...] "The language of battle is often found in the scriptures, for it conveys the strenuous, long, drawn-out campaign we must wage to free ourselves from the tyranny of the ego, the cause of all our suffering and sorrow". To get <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> true self, whether you call that God, Brahman, etc., one has to let go of the ego. [...] The Sanskrit word Ahamkara literally translates into The-sound-of-I, or quite simply the sense of the self or ego.|$|E

[...] —Imtiaz Ali on his film, in an interview with Press Trust of India. After Rockstar (2011), Imtiaz Ali began working on the project, collaborating once again with Ranbir Kapoor and A. R. Rahman. Anushka Sharma was the original choice for the lead actress. However she rejected the film saying the role role of the actress had minimal to do. Later, Deepika Padukone was cast as the lead female in September 2013. The working title of the project was The Window Seat. In an interview with The Indian Express, Ali mentions, [...] "It's that thought which crosses your mind when you are sitting by the window seat of a train and watching Ratlam go by and you think, what if I get down from this train? What life awaits me there?" [...] He justified that outside this window, there is a mythical world where one can be what he wants to. According to him, the window seat gives one a chance to drop their present life story and become a brand new person. Later, the film was titled, Tamasha. The troupe played by Kapoor and Padukone {{is one of the reasons}} for the film's title Tamasha as it refers to the Shakespearean monologue, 'All the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players'. The title of the film stems from the lines by poet Ghalib-"Hota Hai Shab-O-Roz Tamasha Mere Aagey" [...] that translates to, [...] "Your most personal thought is your life's biggest Tamasha. Ali stated that the film is constantly associated with an artist who narrates his stories on stage. In August 2014, Teejan Bai was roped in to perform Pandavani and narrations of the Mahabharata for the film. In an interview with The Press Trust of India, Ali outlined the generalised storyline, [...] "You meet a certain person and you are very enchanted by him. He is free flowing and your type and then you lose touch. Years later when you meet, he is absolutely somebody else." [...] Ali went on to add that the film isn't autobiographical but has minor moments from his personal life portrayed onscreen. He was quoted saying, [...] "Tamasha has that kind of love which makes a normal person extraordinary, which makes a commoner an artist." [...] On the plot's inherent love story, he went on to add, [...] "This is the kind of love through which you understand why you need a woman in life and how it takes you on a journey through which we identify ourselves." ...|$|R
