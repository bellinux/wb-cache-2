25|$|Two {{other major}} subfields of {{psycholinguistics}} investigate first language acquisition, {{the process by}} which infants acquire language, and second language acquisition. In addition, it is much more difficult for adults to acquire second languages than it is for infants to learn their first language (bilingual infants are able to learn both of their native languages easily). Thus, sensitive periods may exist during which language can be learned readily. A great deal of research in psycholinguistics focuses on how this ability develops and diminishes over time. It also {{seems to be the case}} that the more languages one knows, the <b>easier</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> learn more.|$|E
500|$|De Lucía was {{influenced}} primarily by Niño Ricardo, a leading {{figure in the}} history of flamenco guitar, and Sabicas, {{regarded as one of the}} most influential musicians involved in the development and refinement of the flamenco guitar as a concert instrument at a time when the guitar was considered an instrument meant to merely accompany a singer. Sabicas was a mentor to Paco in developing his flamenco guitar technique, as well in honing Paco's skills as a composer, characterized by melodic structure, rhythmic and harmonic, perfectly consistent from beginning to end, and non-lyrical phrased guitar falsetas when the singer stops singing. Esteban de Sanlúcar and Mario Escudero were also major influences on him and sources of inspiration. According to biographer Pohren, de Lucía was [...] "fascinated with jazz" [...] and held a deep respect for high-tech jazz musicians, regarding Di Meola, McLaughlin, Coryell and Corea as highly as musicians as he did his flamenco mentors. Despite these influences, according to the Jazz Times, [...] "Most flamenco fans can trace the music's history to either Before Paco or After Paco." [...] In 2004 interview with El País he said [...] "I have always found that the more technique you have the <b>easier</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> express yourself. If you lack technique you lose the freedom to create." [...] Like many other flamenco guitarists he often played a Hermanos Conde guitar and had his own signature model, but had a range of guitars in his collection.|$|E

500|$|An {{example of}} the low {{threshold}} {{is a point of}} Donetsk psychiatrist Valentine Pekhterev, who argues that psychiatrists speak of the necessity of adapting oneself to society, estimate the level of man's social functioning, his ability to adequately test the reality and so forth. In Pekhterev's words, these speeches hit point-blank on the dissidents and revolutionaries, because all of them are poorly functioning in society, are hardly adapting to it either initially or after increasing requirements. They turn their inability to adapt themselves to society into the view that the company breaks step and only they know how to help the company restructure itself. The dissidents regard the cases of personal maladjustment as a proof of public ill-being. The more such cases, the <b>easier</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> present their personal ill-being [...] as public one. They bite the society's hand that feed them only because they are not given a right place in society. Unlike the dissidents, the psychiatrists destroy the hardly formed defense attitude in the dissidents by regarding [...] "public well-being" [...] as personal one. The psychiatrists extract teeth from the dissidents, stating that they should not bite the feeding hand of society only because the tiny group of the dissidents feel bad being at their place. The psychiatrists claim the need to treat not society but the dissidents and seek to improve society by preserving and improving the mental health of its members. After reading the book Institute of Fools by Viktor Nekipelov, Pekhterev concluded that allegations against the psychiatrists sounded from the lips of a negligible but vociferous part of inmates who when surfeiting themselves with cakes pretended to be sufferers.|$|E

2500|$|Attempting to {{quantify}} this phenomenon, {{in the first}} edition of the book, published in May 1998, Lott wrote that [...] "national surveys" [...] suggested that [...] "98 percent of the time that people use guns defensively, they merely have to brandish a weapon to break off an attack." [...] In that same paragraph he also wrote that [...] "ince in many defensive cases a handgun is simply brandished, and no one is harmed, many defensive uses are never even reported to the police." [...] The higher the rate of defensive gun uses that do not end in the attacker being killed or wounded, the <b>easier</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> explain why defensive gun uses are not covered by the media without reference to media bias.

And I would have a small but very aggressive anti-terrorism agency. And I would frankly give them extraordinary ability to eavesdrop. And my first advice to civil libertarians is simple.

2500|$|The {{film has}} been both criticized and praised for its {{handling}} of subject matter, including the portrayal of harsh interrogation techniques, commonly classified as torture. The use of these techniques was long kept secret by the Bush administration. (See Torture Memos.) Glenn Greenwald, in The Guardian, stated that the film takes a pro-torture stance, describing it as [...] "pernicious propaganda" [...] and stating that it [...] "presents torture as its CIA proponents and administrators see it: as a dirty, ugly business {{that is necessary to}} protect America." [...] Critic Frank Bruni concluded that the film appears to suggest [...] "No waterboarding, no Bin Laden". Jesse David Fox writes that the film [...] "doesn't explicitly say that torture caught bin Laden, but in portraying torture as one part of the successful search, it can be read that way." [...] Emily Bazelon said, [...] "The filmmakers didn't set out to be Bush-Cheney apologists", but [...] "they adopted a close-to-the-ground point of view, and perhaps they're in denial about how far down the path to condoning torture this led them." [...] Journalist Michael Wolff slammed the film as a [...] "nasty piece of pulp and propaganda" [...] and Bigelow as a [...] "fetishist and sadist" [...] for distorting history with a pro-torture viewpoint. Wolff disputed the efficacy of torture and the claim that it contributed to the discovery of bin Laden. In an open letter, social critic and feminist Naomi Wolf criticized Bigelow for claiming the film was [...] "part documentary" [...] and speculated over the reasons for Bigelow's [...] "amoral compromising" [...] of film-making, suggesting that the more pro-military a film, the <b>easier</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> acquire Pentagon support for scenes involving expensive, futuristic military equipment. Wolf likened Bigelow to the acclaimed director and propagandist for the Nazi regime, Leni Riefenstahl, saying: [...] "Like Riefenstahl, you are a great artist. But now you will be remembered forever as torture's handmaiden." [...] Author Karen J. Greenberg wrote that [...] "Bigelow has bought in, hook, line, and sinker, to the ethos of the Bush administration and its apologists" [...] and called the film [...] "the perfect piece of propaganda, with all the appeal that naked brutality, fear, and revenge can bring". Peter Maass of The Atlantic said the film [...] "represents a troubling new frontier of government-embedded filmmaking".|$|E

60|$|A veil {{like that}} of {{oblivion}} dropped before {{the form of the}} missionary. The pious persons who had sent him forth to preach to the heathen, never knew his fate; a disappearance that was so common to that class of devoted men, as to produce regret rather than surprise. Even those who took his life felt a respect for him; and, strange as it may seem, it was to the eloquence of the man who now would have died to save him, that his death was alone to be attributed. Peter had awakened fires that he could not quench, and aroused a spirit that he could not quell. In this respect, he resembled most of those who, under the guise of reform, or revolution, in moments of doubt, set in motion a machine that is found impossible to control, when it is deemed expedient to check exaggeration by reason.
