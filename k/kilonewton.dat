50|$|In 2008, it was {{announced}} that an in-production powerplant would have to be selected; this was required to be in the 95 to 100 <b>kilonewton</b> (kN) (21,000-23,000 lbf) range to execute combat manoeuvres with optimal weapons load. After evaluation and acceptance of technical offers for both the Eurojet EJ200 and the General Electric F414, the commercial quotes were compared in detail and GE's F414 was declared as the lowest bidder. The deal covered the purchase of 99 GE F414 engines, an initial batch will be supplied directly by GE and the remainder to be manufactured in India under a technology transfer arrangement. According to the IAF, adopting the new powerplant required a three-to-four years of redesign work.|$|E
5000|$|The United States Air Force, the Bundeswehr's Luftwaffe, and the Soviets' VVS all {{conducted}} {{experiments in}} zero-length launching. The first manned aircraft to be ZELL-launched was an F-84G in 1955. The Soviets' main interest in ZELL was for point defense-format protection of airfields and critical targets using MiG-19s. The American tests with the F-84s started with using the Martin MGM-1 Matador solid-fuel boost motor of some 240 <b>kilonewton</b> (52,000 lbf) thrust output, which burned out seconds after ignition and dropped {{away from the}} manned fighter {{a second or two}} later; the larger F-100 Super Sabre and MiG-19/SM-30 [...] "Farmer" [...] tests (with the SM-30 using the Soviet-design PRD-22R booster unit) used similar short-burn solid fueled boost motors, of much more powerful 600 kN (135,000 lbf) thrust-class output levels. [...] All works upon ZELL aircraft were abandoned due to logistical concerns and the increasing efficiency of guided missiles.|$|E

40|$|Femur {{fractures}} are {{the most}} frequent long bone fractures in small animals. Due to the femur’s anatomical position, {{it is difficult to}} immobilize, and therefore internal fixations are very useful. Dynamic compression plates (DCP) provide high stability, are durable, minimize fragment movement and promote primary healing of the bone. Advantages of this treatment include anatomical reconstruction, early mobility and carrying capacity of the affected limb. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is an acrylic resin that has proved very useful in bone tumor treatment, cranial deformation prosthesis, percutaneous vertebroplasty and testicular prosthesis in animals. The {{purpose of this study was}} to manufacture DCP-PMMA and test its resistance to the different forces present in a fracture. Forty-eight (48) 3. 5 MM x 4 -hole DCP were made from an alginate mold. Six (6) femurs were obtained from canine cadavers zeighing from 10 to 20 kg, which underwent osteotomy simulating an oblique fracture. The plates were subsequently positioned in the osteotomized bones to submit them to the various forces involved in a fracture. The DCP-PMMA resisted a torque force of 2. 83 newton/metres and a compression and flexion force of 0. 21 <b>kilonewton.</b> The obtained resistance of the DCP-PMMA was an average of 20 kg per force. The results of this study show that it is possible to make a DCP-PMMA 3. 5 mm x 4 -hole, the resistance of which is of 20 kg against the three applied forces, and that it can be used to stabilize long bone fractures subjected to a pressure of less than 20 kg...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the in vitro fracture resistance of teeth restored with bonded ceramic inlay and direct composite resin restoration in comparison to the normal tooth. Materials and Methods: This study evaluated the fracture strength of the teeth restored with bonded ceramic inlay and direct composite resin restoration in comparison to the normal teeth. Thirty intact human maxillary first premolars were assigned to three groups: Group 1 - comprising sound/unprepared teeth (control). Group 2 - comprising of Class-II direct composite resin restored teeth and Group 3 - comprising Class-II ceramic inlay restored teeth. Cavities were prepared with occlusal width of 1 / 3 intercuspal distance and 2 mm deep pulpally. Group 2 teeth were restored with hybrid composite resin (Z 350 3 M ESPE, USA) and group 3 teeth were restored with Vitadur Alpha alumina (Ivoclare Vivadent, Liechtenstein, Europe). Ceramic inlay was bonded with adhesive cement (rely X resin cement of 3 MESPE, USA). The specimens were subjected to a compressive load until they fractured. Data were analyzed statistically by unpaired Student′s t test. Results: The fracture resistant strength, expressed as <b>kilonewton</b> (KN), was group 1 - 1. 51 KN, group 2 - 1. 25 KN, and group 3 - 1. 58 KN. Statistically, group III had highest fracture resistance followed by group I, while group II had the lowest average fracture resistance. Conclusion: The fracture resistant strength of teeth restored with ceramic inlay was comparable to that of the normal intact teeth or slightly higher, while teeth restored with direct composite resin restoration showed less fracture resistant strength than that of the normal teeth...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to obtain accurate data from two three-legged spacecraft landing systems for purposes of validating current and future computer programs for legged landers. Two landing-gear systems were investigated: an inverted tripod system and a cantilever system.

50|$|It was a fixed-thrust engine, {{which could}} not be {{throttled}} or restarted in flight. The LR87 delivered approximately 1,900 <b>kilonewtons</b> (430,000 pounds) of thrust. Early LR87 engines used on the Titan I burned RP-1 and liquid oxygen. Because liquid oxygen is cryogenic, it could not be stored in the missile for long periods of time, and had to be loaded before the missile could be launched. For the Titan II, the engine was converted to use Aerozine-50 and nitrogen tetroxide, which are hypergolic and storable at room temperature. This allowed Titan II missiles to be kept fully fueled and ready to launch on short notice.|$|R

50|$|These {{detectors}} are a mesh {{of small}} detectors installed against a particular stretch of rail. The detectors are typically {{a mix of}} temperature sensors and strain gauges (so measure in degrees Celsius and <b>kilonewtons</b> force). They measure temperature and stress/tension on the rail, to make sure these measures do not go outside the bounds of structural integrity. These systems are initially calibrated to a particular ‘neutral state’ but measuring the rail with neutral compression (no pulling or pushing) and an agreed neutral ambient temperature. The system then measures the rail to detect if these parameters get too far from neutral state, and will alert if the rail is approaching a breach of structural integrity.|$|R
