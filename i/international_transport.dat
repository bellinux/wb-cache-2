5|$|One of Girdap's notable {{enterprises}} was the <b>international</b> <b>transport</b> company Transbalkania {{which had}} a capital of 100,000 leva. Of the company's 500 shares, 200 were owned by Girdap and another 170 were owned by three of the bank's managers or employees. Liquidated after World War I, Transbalkania was active as a carrier from Bulgaria to Edirne, Alexandroupoli, Thessaloniki and Niš and along the Danube. During the wars, Girdap was involved in tobacco trade and had warehouses in modern Dupnitsa, Blagoevgrad and Xanthi. This led {{to the establishment of}} another Girdap venture, the Bulgarian Macedonian Bank (Balgarska makedonska banka), on 21 May 1916. The Bulgarian Macedonian Bank was mostly active as a commercial bank, which is indicated by its capital of 46.95 million leva as opposed to only 13.31 million leva of deposits. Other banks more or less related to Girdap included the Sofia Bank (Sofiyska banka, established in 1906), the Bulgarian Forest Commercial Bank (Balgarska gorsko-targovska banka, established in 1917), and the Bulgarian Surety Bank (Balgarska garantsionna banka, established in 1912). The Pleven-based Lev cement factory was founded in 1917 with Girdap board of managers member Ivan Kovachev as chief shareholder. Ninety percent of the capital of the Kurilo mine in the Iskar Gorge was controlled by Girdap or its head figures Ivan Kovachev and Boncho Boev. Despite Girdap's active involvement in assistance to national industry, it failed to make a significant contribution and gradually minimized its participation due to insufficient profits.|$|E

40|$|Generally, <b>international</b> {{passenger}} <b>transport</b> {{is exempt}} from the value added tax, {{in the case of}} air <b>transport.</b> <b>International</b> road passenger <b>transport</b> is however liable to taxation. However, the Council Directive on Value Added Tax contains a number of variations in the frame of the taxation of <b>international</b> passenger <b>transport</b> both for the states that joined the Community after January 1, 1978 and also for countries that were members of the Community on January 1, 1978. The <b>international</b> passenger <b>transport</b> is therefore rather problematic field due to a number of exceptions for individual Member States. It is on the providers or recipients of transport services to inform correctly about the taxation of <b>international</b> road <b>transport</b> and to pay properly the tax. The aim of the article is to evaluate the possibilities of the taxation of <b>international</b> passenger <b>transport</b> in the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovak Republic, Germany and Poland and to determine how the taxation of <b>international</b> passenger <b>transport</b> affects the tax liability and price of travel services provided in this country. From the comparative analysis it is evident that the tax paid abroad {{should be included in the}} total price of the purchased service. Based on the comparative analysis there will be a proposal for the taxation of <b>international</b> passenger <b>transport</b> so that the tax collection in the monitored countries would be simplified. The proposal recommends to unify an approach during the taxation of <b>international</b> passenger <b>transport</b> for all Member States of the European Union in order to reduce administrative costs on the part of the governments and individual entities...|$|R
40|$|The {{advanced}} internationalisation {{of markets}} and production processes continuously {{adds to the}} complexity of supply chains. At the same time improving the sustainability of the related <b>international</b> freight <b>transport</b> processes and optimising their efficiency is becoming a topic of central relevance. <b>International</b> freight <b>transport</b> models are an important tool to simulate impacts of measures taken to achieve such improvements of transport processes. Yet, the requirements towards <b>international</b> freight <b>transport</b> models are complex: they need to include various modes of transport, they need to cover different industries and their dynamics, they need to consider seasonality of supply and demand of goods, demographic parameters, economic developments, technological developments including their impact on production processes and structures, and many other aspects. Furthermore, <b>international</b> freight <b>transport</b> models need to include freight flows within countries as well as freight flows between the considered countries. This paper discusses the challenges which need to be confronted when developing <b>international</b> freight <b>transport</b> models which are able to correspond to the described complexity of <b>international</b> freight <b>transport.</b> Furthermore, it maps out the most important research gaps which need to be addressed by <b>international</b> freight <b>transport</b> modelling research {{in order to ensure that}} the challenge...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the need for}} legal uniformity in the current field of <b>international</b> containerised multimodal <b>transport,</b> focusing on two parameters: a) the recognition of <b>international</b> containerised <b>transport</b> as a uniform and single transport process, entitled to its own legal framework and b) the reconsideration of {{the legal status of}} operators of transport terminals so as to bring their liability under a legal framework for <b>international</b> containerised <b>transport.</b> Thus, it {{examines the}} particularities of containerisation providing a general overview of the innovations it brought to the global distribution of cargo; discusses its interaction with <b>international</b> multimodal <b>transport</b> placing emphasis on the key role of terminal operators; looks at the legal framework of <b>international</b> containerised multimodal <b>transport</b> indicating that although it is a heavily integrated transport field, yet its legal framework remains disproportionately disharmonised; and finally examines the fragile legal status of terminal operators in <b>international</b> containerised <b>transport</b> to conclude that the regulation of terminal operators' liability should be fall within an overall effort to establish harmonised liability rules applicable throughout the entire <b>international</b> containerised <b>transport.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

25|$|During the 19th century, {{globalization}} approached {{its form}} {{as a direct}} result of the Industrial Revolution. Industrialization allowed standardized production of household items using economies of scale while rapid population growth created sustained demand for commodities.

The transport revolution occurred some time between 1820 and 1850. More nations embraced international trade. Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century imperialism such as in Africa and Asia. The invention of shipping containers in 1956 helped advance the globalization of commerce.|$|E

The US introduced an embargo on air traffic with Yugoslavia on 2 May 1992: the last JAT flights to the United States were to Chicago and New York. JAT management decided to re-route North American long-range flights to Canada. However, Canada quickly followed and banned all JAT flights entering the country, terminating all JAT operations across the North Atlantic.|$|E
