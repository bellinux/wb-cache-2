5|$|The {{rootlets}} of the <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve {{arise from}} the <b>hypoglossal</b> nucleus {{near the bottom of}} the brain stem. The <b>hypoglossal</b> nucleus receives input from both the motor cortices but the contralateral input is dominant; innervation of the tongue is essentially lateralized. Signals from muscle spindles on the tongue travel through the <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve, moving onto the lingual nerve which synapses on the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve (XII) {{exits the}} skull using the <b>hypoglossal</b> canal in the {{occipital}} bone and reaches the tongue to control {{almost all of}} the muscles involved in movements of this organ.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve is {{the twelfth}} cranial nerve, and innervates all the {{extrinsic}} and intrinsic {{muscles of the}} tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the <b>hypoglossal</b> nucleus in the brain stem {{as a number of}} small rootlets, passes through the <b>hypoglossal</b> canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two <b>hypoglossal</b> nerves in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} {{description of the}} <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve was by Herophilos (335–280 BC), {{although it was not}} named at the time. The first use of the name <b>hypoglossal</b> in Latin as nervi hypoglossi externa was used by Winslow in 1733. This was followed though by several different namings including nervi indeterminati, par lingual, par gustatorium, great sub-lingual by different authors, and gustatory nerve and lingual nerve (by Winslow). It was listed in 1778 as nerve hypoglossum magnum by Soemmering. It was then named as the great <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve by Cuvier in 1800 as a translation of Winslow and finally named in English by Knox in 1832.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve arises as {{a number}} of small {{rootlets}} {{from the front of the}} medulla, the bottom part of the brainstem, in the preolivary sulcus, which separates the olive and the pyramid. The nerve passes through the subarachnoid space and pierces the dura mater near the <b>hypoglossal</b> canal, an opening in the occipital bone of the skull.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hypoglossal</b> nucleus {{is derived}} from the basal plate of the {{embryonic}} medulla oblongata.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve, as {{measured}} {{by the size of the}} <b>hypoglossal</b> canal, has been hypothesised to be associated with the progress of evolution of primates, with reasoning that larger nerves would be associated with improvements in speech associated with evolutionary changes. This hypothesis has been refuted.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of damage}} to the <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve are rare. The most common causes of injury in one case series were {{compression}} by tumours and gunshot wounds. A wide variety of other causes can lead to damage of the nerve. These include surgical damage, medullary stroke, multiple slcerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, infection, sarcoidosis, and presence of an ectatic vessel in the <b>hypoglossal</b> canal. Damage can be on one or both sides, which will affect symptoms that the damage causes. Because of the close proximity of the nerve to other structures including nerves, arteries, and veins, it is rare for the nerve to be damaged in isolation. For example, damage {{to the left and}} right <b>hypoglossal</b> nerves may occur with damage to the facial and trigeminal nerves as a result of damage from a clot following arteriosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar artery. Such a stroke may result in tight oral musculature, and difficulty speaking, eating and chewing.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve carries {{lower motor}} neurons that synapse with upper motor neurons at the <b>hypoglossal</b> nucleus. Symptoms related to damage {{will depend on the}} {{position}} of damage in this pathway. If the damage is to the nerve itself (a lower motor neuron lesion), the tongue will curve toward the damaged side, owing to weakness of the genioglossus muscle of affected side. If the damage is to the nerve pathway (an upper motor neuron lesion) the tongue will curve away from the side of damage, due to action of the affected genioglossus muscle, and will occur without fasciculations or wasting, with speech difficulties more evident. Damage to the <b>hypoglossal</b> nucleus will lead to wasting of muscles of the tongue and deviation towards the affected side when it is stuck out. This is because of the weaker genioglossal muscle.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve {{is derived}} from the first pair of {{occipital}} somites, collections of mesoderm that form next to the main axis of an embryo during development. The musculature it supplies develop as the <b>hypoglossal</b> cord from the myotomes of the first four pairs of occipital somites. The nerve is first visible as a series of roots in the fourth week of development, which have formed a single nerve and link to the tongue by the fifth week.|$|E
5|$|These {{muscles are}} {{involved}} in moving and manipulating the tongue. The left and right genioglossus muscles in particular are responsible for protruding the tongue. The muscles, attached to {{the underside of the}} top and back parts of the tongue, cause the tongue to protrude and deviate towards the opposite side. The <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve also supplies movements including clearing the mouth of saliva and other involuntary activities. The <b>hypoglossal</b> nucleus interacts with the reticular formation, involved in the control of several reflexive or automatic motions, and several corticonuclear originating fibers supply innervation aiding in unconscious movements relating to speech and articulation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve is one {{of twelve}} cranial nerves found in amniotes {{including}} reptiles, mammals and birds. As with humans, damage to the nerve or nerve pathway will result in difficulties moving the tongue or lapping water, decreased tongue strength, and generally cause deviation away from the affected side initially, {{and then to the}} affected side as contractures develop. The evolutionary origins of the nerve have been explored through studies of the nerve in rodents and reptiles. The nerve is regarded as arising evolutionarily from nerves of the cervical spine, which has been incorporated into a separate nerve over the course of evolution.|$|E
5|$|The vocal {{production}} system {{is controlled by}} the cranial nerve nucleus in the brain, and supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve, branches of the vagus nerve. The vocal tract is supplied by the <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve and facial nerves. Electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PEG) region of the mammalian midbrain elicit vocalizations. The ability to learn new vocalizations is only exemplified in humans, seals, cetaceans, and possibly bats; in humans, this {{is the result of a}} direct connection between the motor cortex, which controls movement, and the motor neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve {{plays an}} {{important}} role in controlling movements of the tongue. In 1998, one research team used the size of the <b>hypoglossal</b> canal in the base of fossil skulls in an attempt to estimate the relative number of nerve fibres, claiming on this basis that Middle Pleistocene hominins and Neanderthals had more fine-tuned tongue control than either australopithecines or apes. Subsequently, however, it was demonstrated that <b>hypoglossal</b> canal size and nerve sizes are not correlated, and it is now accepted that such evidence is uninformative about the timing of human speech evolution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypoglossal</b> and thalamic {{connections}} aid in oral-related movements.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the {{descending}} {{branch of the}} <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve is contained within the sheath.|$|E
25|$|Posterior {{descending}} pathway (vocal production): {{composed of}} HVC (proper name, although {{sometimes referred to}} as the high vocal center); the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA); and the tracheosyringeal part of the <b>hypoglossal</b> nucleus (nXIIts).|$|E
25|$|The {{genioglossus}} is {{innervated by}} the <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve, as are all {{muscles of the}} tongue except for the palatoglossus. Blood is supplied to the sublingual branch of the lingual artery, {{a branch of the}} external carotid artery.|$|E
25|$|Motor {{supply for}} all {{intrinsic}} and extrinsic {{muscles of the}} tongue is supplied by efferent motor nerve fibers from the <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve (CN XII), {{with the exception of}} the palatoglossus, which is innervated by the vagus nerve (CN X).|$|E
25|$|An area in {{the neck}} {{sometimes}} called the Pirogov triangle is formed by the intermediate tendon of the digastric muscle, the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle, and the <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve. The lingual artery {{is a good place}} to stop severe hemorrhage from the tongue.|$|E
25|$|Neurostimulation is {{currently}} being studied {{as a method of}} treatment; an implanted <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve stimulation system received European CE Mark (Conformité Européenne) approval in March 2012. Also being studied are exercises of the muscles around the mouth and throat through activities such as playing the didgeridoo.|$|E
25|$|The fourth (intradural or intracranial) part pierces {{the dura}} mater and {{inclines}} medialward {{to the front}} of the medulla oblongata; it is placed between the <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve and the anterior root of the first cervical nerve and beneath the first digitation of the ligamentum denticulatum. At the lower border of the pons it unites with the vessel of the opposite side to form the basilar artery.|$|E
25|$|Generally, motor nuclei found {{higher in}} the {{brainstem}} (i.e., more rostral) innervate muscles that are higher on the face. For example, the oculomotor nucleus contains α-MNs that innervate muscles of the eye, and {{is found in the}} midbrain, the most rostral brainstem component. By contrast, the <b>hypoglossal</b> nucleus, which contains α-MNs that innervate the tongue, is found in the medulla, the most caudal (i.e., towards the bottom) of the brainstem structures.|$|E
25|$|It is {{relatively}} superficial at its start, {{where it is}} contained in the carotid triangle of the neck, and lies behind and medial to the external carotid, overlapped by the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and covered by the deep fascia, the platysma, and integument: it then passes beneath the parotid gland, being crossed by the <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve, the digastric muscle and the stylohyoid muscle, the occipital artery and the posterior auricular artery. Higher up, it is separated from the external carotid by the styloglossus and stylopharyngeus muscles, {{the tip of the}} styloid process and the stylohyoid ligament, the glossopharyngeal nerve and the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve. It is in relation, behind, with the longus capitis, the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk, and the superior laryngeal nerve; laterally, with the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve, the nerve lying on a plane posterior to the artery; medially, with the pharynx, superior laryngeal nerve, and ascending pharyngeal artery. At the base of the skull the glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory, and <b>hypoglossal</b> nerves lie between the artery and the internal jugular vein.|$|E
25|$|Both neural {{pathways}} in {{the song}} system begin {{at the level of}} HVC, which projects information both to the RA (premotor nucleus) and to Area X of the anterior forebrain. Information in the posterior descending pathway (also referred to as the vocal production or motor pathway) descends from HVC to RA, and then from RA to the tracheosyringeal part of the <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve (nXIIts), which then controls muscular contractions of the syrinx.|$|E
25|$|This part of {{the artery}} is crossed obliquely, from its medial to its lateral side, by the sternocleidomastoid branch of the {{superior}} thyroid artery; it is also crossed by the superior and middle thyroid veins (which end in the internal jugular vein); descending in front of its sheath is the descending branch of the <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve, this filament being joined by one or two branches from the cervical nerves, which cross the vessel obliquely.|$|E
25|$|For {{patients}} who cannot use a continuous positive airway pressure device, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2014 granted pre-market approval for an upper airway stimulation system that senses respiration and delivers mild electrical stimulation to the <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve {{in order to}} increase muscle tone {{at the back of the}} tongue so it will not collapse over the airway. The device includes a handheld patient controller to allow it to be switched on before sleep and is powered by an implantable pulse generator, similar to one used for cardiac rhythm management. Approval for this active implantable neuromodulation device was preceded by a clinical trial whose results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.|$|E
25|$|Abnormalities of the {{cranial nerves}} are present 50-70% of cases. The most common {{abnormality}} is {{involvement of the}} facial nerve, which may lead to reduced power on one or {{both sides of the}} face (65% resp 35% of all cranial nerve cases), followed by reduction in visual perception due to optic nerve involvement. Rarer symptoms are double vision (oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve or abducens nerve), decreased sensation of the face (trigeminal nerve), hearing loss or vertigo (vestibulocochlear nerve), swallowing problems (glossopharyngeal nerve) and weakness of the shoulder muscles (accessory nerve) or the tongue (<b>hypoglossal</b> nerve). Visual problems may also be the result of papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) due to obstruction by granulomas of the normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation.|$|E
500|$|The <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve {{provides}} {{motor control}} of the extrinsic muscles of the tongue: genioglossus, hyoglossus, styloglossus, and the intrinsic muscles of the tongue. These represent all muscles of the tongue except the palatoglossus muscle. [...] The <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve is of a general somatic efferent (GSE) type.|$|E
500|$|The <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve may be {{connected}} (...) to {{the facial nerve}} to attempt to restore function when the facial nerve is damaged. Attempts at repair by either wholly or partially connecting nerve fibres from the <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve to the facial nerve may be used when there is focal facial nerve damage (for example, from trauma or cancer).|$|E
500|$|Progressive bulbar palsy, a form {{of motor}} neuron disease, is {{associated}} with combined lesions of the <b>hypoglossal</b> nucleus and nucleus ambiguus with wasting (...) of the motor nerves of the pons and medulla. This may cause difficulty with tongue movements, speech, chewing and swallowing caused by dysfunction of several cranial nerve nuclei. Motor neuron disease {{is the most common}} disease affecting the <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve.|$|E
500|$|After {{emerging}} from the <b>hypoglossal</b> canal, the <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve gives off a meningeal branch {{and picks up a}} branch from the anterior ramus of C1. [...] It then travels close to the vagus nerve [...] and spinal division of the accessory nerve, spirals downwards behind the vagus nerve and passes between the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein lying on the carotid sheath.|$|E
500|$|Cranial nerves {{are also}} present in other vertebrates. Other amniotes (non-amphibian tetrapods) have cranial nerves {{similar to those of}} humans. [...] In anamniotes (fishes and amphibians), the {{accessory}} nerve (XI) and <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve (XII) do not exist, with the accessory nerve (XI) being {{an integral part of the}} vagus nerve (X); the <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve (XII) is represented by a variable number of spinal nerves emerging from vertebral segments fused into the occiput. These two nerves only became discrete nerves in the ancestors of amniotes (non-amphibian tetrapods).|$|E
500|$|At a {{point at}} the level of the angle of the mandible, the <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve emerges from behind the [...] {{posterior}} belly of the digastric muscle. It then loops around a branch of the occipital artery and travels forward into the region beneath the mandible. The <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve moves forward deep to the hyoglossus and stylohyoid muscles and lingual nerve. It continues deep to the genioglossus muscle and continues forward to the tip of the tongue. It distributes branches to the intrinsic and extrinsic muscle of the tongue innervates as it passes in this direction, and supplies several muscles (hyoglossus, genioglossus and styloglossus) that it passes.|$|E
500|$|The <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve (XII) {{is unique}} {{in that it is}} innervated from both the motor cortex of both hemispheres of the brain. Damage to the nerve at lower motor neuron level may lead to {{fasciculations}} or atrophy of the muscles of the tongue. The fasciculations of the tongue are sometimes said to look like a [...] "bag of worms". Upper motor neuron damage will not lead to atrophy or fasciculations, but only weakness of the innervated muscles.|$|E
500|$|Most typically, {{humans are}} {{considered}} to have twelve pairs of cranial nerves (I–XII). They are: the olfactory nerve (I), the optic nerve (II), oculomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV), trigeminal nerve (V), abducens nerve (VI), facial nerve (VII), vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), vagus nerve (X), accessory nerve (XI), and <b>hypoglossal</b> nerve (XII). (There may be a thirteenth cranial nerve, the terminal nerve (nerve O or N), which is very small and {{may or may not}} be functional in humans) ...|$|E
