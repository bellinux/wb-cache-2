50|$|AT&T Communications, Inc., was a {{division}} of the AT&T Corp. that, through 23 subsidiaries, provided <b>interexchange</b> <b>carrier</b> and long distance telephone services.|$|E
50|$|Each carrier (interexchange {{or local}} exchange) is {{assigned}} a four-digit identification code, the Carrier Identification Code (CIC) {{which was used}} with feature groups. The <b>interexchange</b> <b>carrier</b> to which calls from a subscriber line are routed by default {{is known as the}} Presubscribed <b>Interexchange</b> <b>Carrier</b> (PIC). To give telephone users the possibility of opting for a different carrier on a call-by-call basis, Carrier Access Codes (CAC) were devised. These consist of the digits 101 followed by the four-digit CIC. The CAC is dialed as a prefix immediately before dialing a long-distance phone number.|$|E
50|$|The {{intent was}} that {{interexchange}} carriers could use 700 numbers to implement new services quickly. When a 700 number is dialed, the local exchange carrier processing the call routes {{it to the}} presubscribed <b>interexchange</b> <b>carrier,</b> unless the caller has overridden presubscription by dialing 101XXXX before the number. Thus each <b>interexchange</b> <b>carrier</b> has access to all 7.92 million 700 numbers. 700 numbers are different from all other North American Numbering Plan numbers because the destinations are not unique, and, in fact, depend on the network the caller has selected.|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{whether there}} is any continuing justification for applying state utility gross receipts taxes to <b>interexchange</b> telecommunications <b>carriers.</b> First, the article explores the historical basis for imposing special taxes on utilities, including telecommunications companies, and observes that such levies were designed as {{a quid pro quo}} for the special rights and privileges the state granted to utilities. Next, it traces the evolution of the telecommunications industry and demonstrates that the historical rationale for imposing gross receipts taxes on the telecommunications industry no longer applies to the competitive segment of the industry in which <b>interexchange</b> <b>carriers</b> operate. The article points out that generally accepted criteria of sound tax policy militate against the imposition of a special gross receipts tax on <b>interexchange</b> <b>carriers.</b> Finally, the article notes that other studies support its conclusion that {{there is no longer any}} justification for imposing utility gross receipts taxes on <b>interexchange</b> <b>carriers.</b> The article concludes by recommending that states reconsider their telecommunications tax policies in light of these conclusions...|$|R
50|$|Although some {{access charges}} are billed {{directly}} to <b>interexchange</b> <b>carriers,</b> {{a significant percentage}} of all access charges are paid by the local end users.|$|R
50|$|Presubscribed <b>Interexchange</b> <b>Carrier</b> Charge (PICC), {{also called}} Carrier Line Charge, is {{a charge that}} United States long {{distance}} telephone companies pay to incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) to help recover local loop costs.|$|E
50|$|An {{access charge}} is a charge {{made by a}} local {{exchange}} carrier for use of its local exchange facilities for a purpose such as the origination or termination of network traffic that is carried to or from a distant exchange by an <b>interexchange</b> <b>carrier.</b>|$|E
50|$|Long {{distance}} carrier-specific: Area code 700 {{is reserved}} for carrier-specific numbers operated by interstate long distance providers, such as AT&T. With the exception of 1-700-555-4141 (which identifies the default <b>interexchange</b> <b>carrier</b> on a line), {{all of these are}} LD carrier-specific. Area code 700 is therefore rarely used.|$|E
50|$|They defined {{switching}} arrangements {{from local}} exchange carriers central offices to <b>interexchange</b> <b>carriers.</b> These arrangements were described {{in an official}} tariff of the National Exchange Carrier Association, filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).|$|R
5000|$|An access {{tandem switch}} connects local {{telephone}} exchanges to long-distance telephone companies (or <b>interexchange</b> <b>carriers,</b> [...] "IXCs"). The {{point at which}} an access tandem connects to the IXC's switch is called the point of presence, or POP.|$|R
5000|$|In 1995 AT&T {{introduced}} a [...] "follow-me" [...] service under {{the brand name}} of AT&T True Connections using the 500 area code. It was designed to replace the AT&T EasyReach 700 service. Other local exchange <b>carriers</b> and <b>interexchange</b> <b>carriers</b> introduced similar competitive services.|$|R
50|$|Telecom North America Inc is an <b>interexchange</b> <b>carrier</b> {{licensed}} in {{all states}} of the USA and in all provinces of Canada. It was created on March 27, 2002, as the American subsidiary of 3U Telecom AG, a German telecom provider (Xetra: uuu.de). The company headquarters are located in Henderson, Nevada.|$|E
5000|$|In 1996, AT&T filed {{a patent}} {{infringement}} suit against Excel, including some specific method or process claims {{related to the}} step of [...] "generating a message record for an interexchange call between an originating subscriber and a terminating subscriber," [...] {{and the use of}} primary <b>interexchange</b> <b>carrier</b> (PIC) indicator in the message record.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Patent No. 5,333,184 (or the '184 patent), {{entitled}} 'Message Recording for Telephone Systems', {{described a}} method {{to take advantage of}} adding more data into a message record in order to provide appropriate billing for subscribers, based on whether or not the subscriber and call recipient subscribe to the same long-distance carrier. This data is called Primary <b>interexchange</b> <b>carrier</b> indicator (PIC).|$|E
50|$|With Bell System divestiture, {{the network}} in the US was divided into local access and {{transport}} areas (LATAs). Calls within LATAs were carried by Local Exchange Carriers (LECs), while calls between them were carried by <b>interexchange</b> <b>carriers</b> (IXCs). LATAs generally have one or more tandem switches which interconnect end office switches.|$|R
5000|$|The {{services}} {{debuted in}} the late 1990s, originally as 10-321 (and its numerous variants) before the telephone industry expanded carrier access codes to seven digits instead of the original five. Although [...] "dial-around" [...] <b>interexchange</b> <b>carriers</b> existed prior to the debut of 10-10-321, these {{were among the first}} to feature a mass multimedia advertising campaign.|$|R
5000|$|SCANA Communications {{claims to}} offer {{a wide range of}} [...] "leading edge {{communications}} solutions" [...] in South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia. The company operates fiber optic LONG-HAUL and ACCESS networks throughout South Carolina and in parts of North Carolina and Georgia, and leverages the fiber of its partners, Palmetto Net and FRC, which are regional <b>Interexchange</b> <b>carriers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{wireline}} {{telephone companies}} {{are divided into}} two large categories: long distance (<b>interexchange</b> <b>carrier,</b> or IXCs) and local (local exchange carrier, or LECs). This structure {{is a result of}} 1984 divestiture of then-regulated monopoly carrier American Telephone & Telegraph. Local telephone companies {{at the time of the}} divestiture are also known as Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILEC).|$|E
50|$|Alascom, Inc., d/b/a AT&T Alaska, is an Alaskan {{telecommunications}} company; specifically, an <b>interexchange</b> <b>carrier</b> (IXC). AT&T Alascom {{is currently}} a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T Inc. AT&T Alascom, previously known as Alascom and many other names, was the first long-distance telephone company in Alaska. AT&T Alascom has extensive telecommunications infrastructure in Alaska, including three satellites, undersea and terrestrial cables containing optical fiber, and numerous earth stations.|$|E
50|$|OneSimCard was {{introduced}} in 2007 by parent company Belmont Telecom Inc. a licensed U.S. <b>interexchange</b> <b>carrier</b> providing telecommunications services since 1994. OneSimCard is distributed by retail stores throughout North America, including Fry's Electronics. OneSimCard is sold inflight on Virgin Atlantic and Malaysia Airlines. Service can also be purchased online at OneSimCard.com where you can buy international SIM cards as well as purchase and rent international cell phones.|$|E
25|$|Houston, with a {{customer}} base {{of more than}} 3 million, is AT's largest service city. The city's telecommunications infrastructure completes more than 70 million Houston telephone connections daily. The Texas Public Utilities Commission has certified more than 400 additional local exchange carriers to provide service statewide or specifically within Houston. More than 1,600 <b>interexchange</b> <b>carriers</b> have registered with the commission to provide long distance service.|$|R
50|$|These Feature Group {{alternatives}} {{allowed the}} LEC's end users to make long distance calls using the <b>interexchange</b> <b>carrier's</b> network, when non-stored program-controlled exchanges {{could not be}} modified to provide equal access. By the mid 1990s, Equal Access features in exchange software had rendered Feature Group D universally available in modern landline exchanges; the others are either used for calling card applications or are obsolete.|$|R
50|$|The {{area code}} was {{intended}} for presubscribing telephone numbers to particular <b>interexchange</b> <b>carriers.</b> Numbers in this area code are exclusive to the specific carrier, so the destination of a given number in 700 may be different for each carrier. Almost all of the early 700 offerings have faded into history, due {{to a combination of}} confusion, blocking of calls to them by many businesses worried about high-charge phone calls, and many alternative services.|$|R
5000|$|American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) first {{introduced}} 800 Toll-Free service in 1967. When AT&T {{was the only}} <b>Interexchange</b> <b>Carrier</b> (IC), Local Exchange Carriers (LECs) automatically routed all Toll-Free calls directly to AT&T Points of Presence (POP) without performing a translation from the Toll-Free number to the terminating number. The LECs routed the calls to AT&T based on the first 3 digits (800) of the dialed number. AT&T then performed all number translations and service area validation screenings.|$|E
5000|$|In Telecommunications a Point of Interface (POI) {{is used to}} {{show the}} {{physical}} interface between two different carriers, such as a local exchange carrier (LEC) and a wireless carrier or an LEC and an <b>IntereXchange</b> <b>Carrier</b> (IXC). This demarcation point often defines responsibility as well as serving as a point for testing. In many cases, a POI exists {{as a point of}} demarcation ("DEMARC") within an LEC building, and is established under [...] "Co-Location" [...] agreements. A long distance, wireless, or competitive local carrier 'rents' space at the local telephone (usually tandem switch) location.|$|E
50|$|Most U.S. and Canadian {{wireless}} carriers do not {{let their}} customers choose an IXC (long-distance carrier). Instead, the wireless carriers send all long-distance calls through one pre-selected <b>interexchange</b> <b>carrier,</b> then bill customers directly for the calls. Fido Solutions, in Canada, once offered a CityFido plan which let customers switch to Yak Communications as their PIC (presubscribed long-distance provider), but only for outgoing calls made from Fido's Toronto calling zone. As Fido {{was taken over by}} Rogers Communications in 2004, the plan is no longer available to new subscribers. Another such arrangement in the U.S. is Sprint Wireless allowing users to select Google Voice to carry their long distance calls.|$|E
5000|$|... 10-10-321 is a United States long-distance {{phone service}} {{best known for}} its {{prolific}} television and direct mail advertising in the late 1990s. 10-10-321 was the first mass-marketed service of its type, and it and the similar 10-10-220 and 10-10-987 services were all owned by Telecom USA, which was owned by MCI. All services of its kind are known as <b>interexchange</b> <b>carriers,</b> which essentially allow consumers to bypass, or [...] "dial-around" [...] their primary long-distance carrier and use a different one.|$|R
50|$|The IPKall {{business}} model {{appears to be}} based on its ability to charge termination rates for calls reaching its subscribers, estimated at about $.01/min, as the service is free for end users. The wholesale price for major <b>interexchange</b> <b>carriers</b> to terminate calls to independent telcos in rural Washington (state) and similar locations (such as northern Minnesota and Iowa) is often several cents a minute higher than typical US48 rates; this money is effectively a subsidy to the destination local rural exchange.|$|R
50|$|For {{voice over}} IP resellers, some {{specialized}} CLECs (for local numbers) or <b>interexchange</b> <b>carriers</b> (for toll-free numbers) will deliver blocks of {{direct inward dial}} calls already converted to Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) or common VoIP formats. The individual VoIP provider need only obtain an inventory of local or freephone numbers from VoIP-aware carriers in various regions, import them in bulk to a VoIP PBX (such as Asterisk) and issue them individually to end users. International DID numbers can be purchased in bulk from international providers.|$|R
5000|$|Incumbent local {{exchange}} carriers, {{such as the}} regional Bell operating companies, have typically resisted rate center consolidation because [...] "intraLATA toll calls", relatively short-haul US domestic long distance calls handled by the local carrier instead of an <b>interexchange</b> <b>carrier,</b> represent $2.7 billion per year for which they can bill subscribers. Often, incumbent carriers will threaten small communities with substantial increases in the monthly cost of an individual line if rate center consolidation expands local calling areas. The rare exceptions have been small groups of suburbs which each already have the same local calling area; one unified rate center would allow wire-line subscribers to keep existing numbers if they move {{from one of the}} communities to another.|$|E
5000|$|Feature Group D: The current standard, {{requires}} the local switch support equal access by competing carriers at the trunk level; highest quality connection, and allows pre-selection of the <b>interexchange</b> <b>carrier</b> by the end-user. This feature group permits {{two types of}} calls. If a user dials 1 + area code + seven-digit number, the long distance call is handled by a default carrier chosen by the user. Alternatively, a user dials 101 + four-digit carrier code + area code + seven-digit number, and the call is handled by the carrier specified by the carrier code. The original batch of carrier codes began with 0, so this type of [...] "dial around" [...] service was typically marketed as dial-around 101-xxxx service. NANPA maintains separate lists of carrier codes for feature groups 'B' and 'D' as not all long distance providers support both standards.|$|E
50|$|An <b>Interexchange</b> <b>Carrier</b> (IXC) is a U.S. {{legal and}} {{regulatory}} {{term for a}} telecommunications company, commonly called a long-distance telephone company, such as MCI (before its absorption by Verizon), Sprint and the former AT&T Corporation (before its merger with SBC in 2005). In the United States, it is defined as any carrier that provides inter-LATA communication, where a LATA is a local access and transport area. From the telephone user's point of view, the long-distance company does not handle calls {{that do not have}} additional tolls. Calls made across phone circuits within the local geographic area covered by one local network are handled only by that one LATA, commonly called a 'local telephone exchange.' Local calls are usually defined by connections made without additional charge whether the connected call is in the same LATA or connects to another LATA with no charge. In the United States intraLATA usually refers to rated or 'Toll' calls between LATA within state boundaries, as opposed to interstate, or calls between LATA in different states.|$|E
50|$|The US {{regulatory}} structure is non-standard as it splits long-distance calls into multiple, arbitrary categories; an intrastate call is regulated {{under state law}} but, once interstate commerce is at stake, federal regulation is applied. The local access and transport area or LATA, another arbitrary US regulatory construct, was created during the 1984 breakup of the Bell System as a demarcation between in-region calls (which were handled by local telephone companies such as the Baby Bells) and out-of-region calls (handled by <b>interexchange</b> <b>carriers</b> such as AT&T, MCI and Sprint).|$|R
40|$|Local {{transport}} in US telecommunications, {{the movement}} of long-distance traffic between local exchange and <b>interexchange</b> <b>carriers,</b> is becoming more competitive. The introduction of competition into regulated markets has predictable consequences such as driving prices towards costs, eliminating cross subsidies, increasing efficiency, increasing product diversity and accelerating the rate of innovation. After surveying institutional developments and alternative definitions of competition, the authors investigate {{the extent to which}} the predicted developments of deregulation are found in the case of local transport. Evidence of increasing competition is found and it is suggested that regulatory policy should take this into account. ...|$|R
50|$|In the United States, both <b>interexchange</b> <b>carriers</b> (IXCs) such as Sprint, AT&T Inc., and Verizon, and Local Exchange Carriers (LECs) such as Verizon and AT&T offer {{toll-free}} services. The {{way that}} a toll-free number is handled depends on {{whether it is a}} domestic or an interexchange call. Most countries are divided into regions called exchanges, and within each exchange a local telephone company handles all phone services. Intraexchange calls, which do not leave the individual region, would be managed by the individual local telephone company. Calls that cross U.S. LATA boundaries - or originate in one country and terminate in another - are referred to as interexchange calls.|$|R
