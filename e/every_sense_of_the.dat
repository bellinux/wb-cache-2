Patrick realizes what Robin and this baby truly mean to him and knows that he wants them to be a family in <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word, but Robin still has concerns. Although Robin states that Patrick could see his child as much as he wants, she does not believe he is fully {{committed}} or prepared to give up his bachelorhood for a family. He takes her to court and only after his moving testimony does she realize Patrick truly wants this, her and their child, their family. They wait for their baby as a happy, loving committed couple. On August 12, 2008, Patrick and Robin learn their baby is a girl. As Patrick goes into full panicked father mode, Robin tries to calm him down. Later, when Patrick sees Robin with Jason, he expresses his concern that he does not want his child to be around such a dangerous target and Robin agrees.|$|E

500|$|In {{its initial}} {{run at the}} Opéra-Comique, Carmen {{provoked}} little public enthusiasm; it shared the theatre for a while with Verdi's much more popular Requiem.

Early on 3 June, {{the day after the}} opera's 33rd performance, Bizet died suddenly of heart disease, at the age of 36. It was his wedding anniversary. That night's performance was cancelled; the tragic circumstances brought a temporary increase in public interest during the brief period before the season ended. Du Locle brought Carmen back in November 1875, with the original cast, and it ran for a further 12 performances until 15 February 1876 to give a year's total for the original production of 48. Among those who attended one of these later performances was Tchaikovsky, who wrote to his benefactor, Nadezhda von Meck: [...] "Carmen is a masterpiece in <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word ... one of those rare creations which expresses the efforts of a whole musical epoch".

Sociologist John Theobald of the Southampton Institute argued that Hergé had no interest in providing factual information about the Soviet Union, but only wanted to inculcate his readers against Marxism, hence depicting the Bolsheviks rigging elections, killing opponents and stealing the grain from the people. According to literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University, Hergé cast the Bolsheviks as [...] "absolute evil" [...] but was unable to understand how they had risen to power, or what their political views were. This meant that Tintin did not know this either, thereby observing the Soviet [...] "world of misery" [...] and fighting Bolsheviks without being able to foment an effective counter-revolution. Literary critic Tom McCarthy described the plot as [...] "fairly straightforward" [...] and criticised the depiction of Bolsheviks as [...] "pantomime cut-outs".|$|E

Devils' general manager Lou Lamoriello praised his impact {{both on and off the}} ice: [...] "Certainly (the tangibles were) the quality player he was even at that time, how good he was defensively as well as always finding a way to get big goals. It was also about how good he was on faceoffs. And the intangibles, which are really more tangible than anything, are what he brought in the locker room from leadership and unselfishness. It was obvious that when he didn't play he was still so active in his support. He's genuine in <b>every</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word. He was a true team player."
