5|$|December 18, 1990: A Greyhound bus left Salt Lake City for Chicago {{and became}} entrenched in a driving {{snowstorm}} on I-80. Just {{short of the}} Wyoming border, the bus {{was hit by a}} semi-tractor trailer that had crossed the median heading the opposite direction. The force of the collision tipped the bus onto its right side and steered it down a steep embankment. The bus slid for 150 feet and came to rest against a fence, about 35 <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> eastbound lanes of I-80. 7 passengers were killed and more than 40 injured.|$|E
5|$|San Marcos {{was used}} for gunnery {{practice}} throughout World War II, although generally as an anchor for a canvas target screen. Sitting two to six <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> surface and marked by an unlit buoy, she {{was responsible for the}} sinking of the cargo ship Lexington in 1940 following a collision. Tons of explosives were used to demolish her upperworks and drive her hull deep into the mud; by January 1959, they were successful and she remains there today.|$|E
50|$|The pitch remains lively as the water-level {{is unusually}} high in Lahli. At places water is found only {{two to four}} <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> ground, and that helps in keeping the pitch and outfield green.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't at all doubt,' said Mrs. Woodward, 'that {{if we were}} to get a sly peep at you, {{we should}} find you both sitting comfortably at your inn all the time, and that neither of you will go a <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> ground.' ...|$|R
60|$|Dick was {{surprised}} by the fellow's persistence, but there is a fascination in shooting at a target, and when Jake urged him he took the pistol. Steadying it with stiffened wrist and forearm, he fired but hit <b>the</b> post a <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> paper.|$|R
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} April 25, 2011, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with the working title Group Hug. In June 2011, stuntman Jeremy Fitzgerald injured his head while attempting a stunt involving a 30-foot fall from a building after {{getting hit by}} an arrow. A Marvel spokesperson later told TMZ.com that despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and continued working on set. The following month, secondary filming took place about an hour outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the Butler area. A chase sequence was also shot in Worthington, Pennsylvania at Creekside Mushroom Farms, the world's largest single-site mushroom farm, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> ground for filming.|$|E
5|$|Wichita {{continued}} to provide gunfire support {{throughout the rest}} of the month. On 27 April, a small caliber shell penetrated a fuel oil tank five <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> waterline. After temporary repairs while still off Okinawa proved unsuccessful, Wichita returned to Kerama Retto where the damage was repaired on 29–30 April. Wichita then returned to the gun line. On 12 May, the ship was damaged by friendly fire. A 5inch round struck the port aircraft catapult; shell fragments hit the shield of an antiaircraft director, killing one man and injuring eleven others. She departed the area to rest and refit at Leyte, returning to Okinawa on 18 June. Wichita {{continued to}} provide gunfire support to the troops on Okinawa through July, as part of Task Unit 2. On 15 August, the ship's crew received word that the war with Japan was over. Wichita was awarded 13 battle stars for her service during World War II.|$|E
25|$|Flood waters were {{released}} through two overflow weirs, 25 meters wide (82 feet), situated 2 meters (6.58 <b>feet)</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> crown {{and following the}} slopes of the hillside.|$|E
60|$|Henery {{appeared}} in a drab kerseymere great-coat, buttoned over his smock-frock, the white skirts of the latter being visible to the distance of about a <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> coat-tails, which, when you {{got used to the}} style of dress, looked natural enough, and even ornamental--it certainly was comfortable.|$|R

[...] "The {{waters of}} the Somme are but a <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> level of this window; the river is yellow and swollen, and a few hours' heavy rain would bring it above the level of this sill. Stand steady, Ralph, I am coming down again." ...|$|R
25|$|Each of the {{below ground}} explosions—some {{as deep as}} 5,000 feet—vaporized a large chamber, leaving a cavity filled with {{radioactive}} rubble. About {{a third of the}} tests were conducted directly in aquifers, and others were hundreds or thousands of <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> water table.|$|E
25|$|The Caney River {{flows through}} Bartlesville, {{separating}} {{the downtown area}} from the east side. The river flooded in October 1986 {{as a result of}} unusually heavy rainfall. The city was split in half for several days, and the flood caused considerable property damage. The river broke its banks again in June 2007, cresting five <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> 1986 level.|$|E
25|$|The general grey slate {{and back}} gardens of Plymouth, {{as seen from}} the Great Western made the {{surprise}} of Saltash Bridge all the more exciting. Up and down stream, grey battleships were moored in the Tamar and its reaches. Hundreds of <b>feet</b> <b>below,</b> <b>the</b> pathetic steam ferry to Saltash from the Devon bank tried to compete with Brunel's mighty bridge.|$|E

50|$|The city {{sits on the}} {{southern}} end of the former lake bed of the prehistoric Lake Chicago, and also the current Lake Michigan. Most of the city's soil nearly one <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> surface is pure sand. The sand beneath Gary, and on its beaches, is of such high quality that in years past it was mined for the manufacture of glass.|$|R
5000|$|The Louw Wepener Decoration is {{a silver}} medallion, 38 millimetres in diameter, which depicts the {{mountain}} peak of Thaba Bosigo, {{with two men}} on horseback at its <b>foot.</b> <b>Below</b> <b>the</b> horsemen are the words [...] "THABA BOSIGO, 1865" [...] and around the circumference are the words [...] "LOUW WEPENER" [...] {{at the top and}} [...] "DECORATION • DEKORASIE" [...] at the bottom.|$|R
25|$|They made spear {{points of}} jasper, quartz, shale, or black chert. They {{traveled}} to quarries {{in search of}} stones for spear points or they traded with other small groups for these points. They also used atl-atls, which is a stick that throws a dart with a lighter stone point than a spear. Later, coniferous forests grew as the area warmed. Paleo-Indian camp sites are many <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> present ground surface, making them difficult to locate.|$|E
25|$|Along {{the way in}} Millard Canyon, {{a special}} station stop was made at Dawn Station above the Dawn Mines, an old gold mining operation. The mines were deep in the canyon and {{visitors}} stopping off to see the digs spent an exorbitant amount of time {{getting back to the}} train. A false adit was dug just a hundred <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> track to trick people into thinking they had visited the mine and were shortly ready to return to the train.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{the results}} of {{drilling}} operations on Enewetak (Eniwetok) Atoll, in the nearby Ralik Chain of the Marshall Islands, Bikar may include as much as 4600 feet of reef material atop a basalt rock base. As most local coral growth stops at about 150 <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> ocean surface, such a massive stony coral base suggests a gradual isostatic subsidence of the underlying extinct volcano, which itself rises 10,000 feet from the surrounding ocean floor. Shallow water fossils taken from just above Enewetak's basalt base are dated to about 55 mya.|$|E
50|$|Similar designs {{have been}} {{produced}} by A.R.M. (Skymaster), Topfun, Meisho, Mondial (Sky Flyer), and Vekoma (Sky Flyer). There is {{a version of the}} ride called the Footloose, where the riders <b>feet</b> are dangling <b>below</b> <b>the</b> car. There is also a park model manufactured by Zamperla called the Hawk 48 where riders' <b>feet</b> dangle <b>below</b> <b>the</b> seats.|$|R
2500|$|On December 26, 1913, {{the steamer}} Oregona {{collided}} with the anchored barge Champoeg 12 miles upriver from Portland, causing {{a hole in the}} Oregona’s hull. [...] As a result, Oregona filled with water and sank, with the upper deck a <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> surface of the water. [...] There was no loss of life, and with the aid of Grahamona, most of the cargo was salvaged.|$|R
50|$|Foamhenge is {{designed}} to match Stonehenge, with similarly sized pieces oriented in astronomically equivalent coordinates. The 'stones' are composed completely of styrofoam and painted gray. Each piece is stabilized with an embedded 2.5 in pipe, extending from the top, through the piece and anchored into a concrete <b>footing</b> <b>below.</b> <b>The</b> entire structure was assembled in about ten days, as opposed to Stonehenge's construction period of about 1000 years.|$|R
25|$|On July 18, 2001, a 60-car CSXT freight derailed in the Howard Street Tunnel, {{sparking}} a {{fire that}} burned for six days and blocked traffic for much longer. The Howard Street Tunnel fire {{called attention to the}} Belt Line, both as a risk to the surrounding structures and as a link in rail traffic. CSXT has implemented various improvements to increase the integrity of the link, but is limited by the shallow depth of the bore (only three <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> surface at the south end) and the instability of the surrounding soil.|$|E
25|$|America lies along a steep {{underwater}} cliff, {{with the}} wreckage sitting {{as deep as}} 85 feet to as shallow as only two feet to the surface, and can be easily seen by visitors arriving in Washington Harbor. The ship lies about 190 feet from Isle Royale. The hull is completely intact, as are the belowdeck cabins and the stern. The forward part of the superstructure is missing due to the elements and salvage operations. The effects of winter ice {{can be seen as}} far down as 30 <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> surface, and alterations to the vessel from earlier salvage attempts are apparent.|$|E
25|$|The uptown {{tracks are}} about ten <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} grade {{at the point}} where they turn off. The old uptown express and local trackways that used to lead to the 42nd Street Shuttle are visible from the uptown local track. As the alignment of the original trackways curves into the old Grand Central station on the 42nd Street Shuttle, it passes through the rebuilt area for the proposed Grand Central station shuttle platform. From the public passageway, none of the original support columns and roof are visible, since they were removed in exactly this area to open the way for the unused shuttle station. The unused ramps leading from the 42nd Street Shuttle are still in place, just south of this station.|$|E

He lost his right hand and left <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> knee. 80% of his body were burnt but today he enjoys a good health. He has five children and a grandchild. Nordtvedt used to be right-handed, but when he lost his hand he {{had to learn how to}} write with his left hand.|$|R
5000|$|Fruitlands was {{initially}} known as [...] "Bald Hill Flat" [...] following a gold {{rush to the}} area in August 1863. Miners Andrew Drew and Ben Buchanan were getting an ounce of gold in 30 buckets from a depth of only a <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> surface. In {{the next few years}} the whole of Bald Hill Flat was prospected with small amounts of gold recovered from shallow depths almost everywhere.|$|R

25|$|The pontoon hull {{was built}} of soft Siemens steel framing and 11 {{millimeters}} thick sheet iron. In November 1879, when the double bottom was 2/3 complete (but not formally laid down yet), Popov persuaded the imperial authorities to award interior finishes contact to the British, and hired Tideman {{to review the}} design again. Tideman built another 1:10 scale model, ran another series of tests and recommended changes to the powerplant and propeller arrangement that caused a significant extension of the contract. The Livadia had a double, perfectly flat bottom and only 7ft (2.1 m) of draft, excluding the propellers. Their blades projected 9 <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> hull. Tideman found what he claimed was near-perfect propeller configuration: all three screws had the same diameter but varied in blade pitch, which in practice required running the engines at different revolutions per minute.|$|E
25|$|Ancient surface copper {{workings}} {{were known}} at Kansanshi (near Solwezi), Bwana Mkubwa and Luanshya, all on what later {{became known as}} the Copperbelt, and BSAC exploration in the 1890s indicated there were significant deposits in the area. However, they could not be commercially exploited until a railway had been built. A railway bridge across the Zambezi was constructed in 1903 and the line was continued northward, reaching Broken Hill in 1906, where the lead and zinc vanadium mine was opened, and reaching the Belgian Congo border in 1909. At that time, mining had started in Katanga, where rich copper oxide ores occurred near the surface. In Northern Rhodesia, the surface ores were of poorer quality, and copper was only worked intermittently at Bwana Mkubwa, until in 1924 rich copper sulphide ores were discovered about 100 <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> surface.|$|E
25|$|However, the Monarch {{had also}} {{sustained}} serious damage. Her stem was stoved in, {{and had it}} not been for an extra-strong collision bulkhead she may well also of foundered. On discharging the Peveril's crew and passenger, the Monarch moved across the harbour to the Red Pier; and then to the South Quay in order for repairs to be effected, where she attracted considerable attention from the public. A report in the Ramsey Courier; Tuesday, 19 September 1899, stated that the Monarch's bow was covered by canvas in order to obscure the result of the impact, but the entirety could not be fully hidden. Damage could be seen in the shape of a hole, extending several <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> waterline, as well as damage to her plating stretching back approximately 20feet, as a consequence of striking the Peveril's belting.|$|E
60|$|The others saw the cunning of the suggestion, and so {{the trench}} was {{lengthened}} to accommodate the corpse, {{and in the center}} a deeper hole was excavated for the box, which was first wrapped in sailcloth and then lowered to its place, which brought its top about a <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the grave. Earth was shovelled in and tramped down about the chest until the bottom of the grave showed level and uniform.|$|R
30|$|Water {{samples were}} {{collected}} by lowering the bottle at depth of about one <b>foot</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> surface, rinsed the bottle three times with the water to be collected before the actual collection of the samples. After collection, the cap of each sampling bottle was screwed on tightly to avoid leakage (Asef Iqbal and Gupta 2009; Reza and Singh 2010; Odukoya and Abimbola 2010). A 0.45 -μm membrane filter {{was used to remove}} unwanted materials from collected water samples.|$|R

This convention maintains the same orientation of the floor and ceilings plans - looking down from above. RCPs are used by designers and architects to demonstrate lighting, visible mechanical features, and ceiling forms as part of the documents provided for construction.|$|R
