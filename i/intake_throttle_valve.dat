50|$|The first {{automotive}} {{direct injection}} system {{used to run}} on gasoline was developed by Bosch, and was introduced by Goliath for their Goliath GP700 automobile, and Gutbrod in 1952. This was basically a high-pressure diesel direct-injection pump with an <b>intake</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>valve.</b> (Diesels only change the amount of fuel injected to vary output; there is no throttle.) This system used a normal gasoline fuel pump, to provide fuel to a mechanically driven injection pump, which had separate plungers per injector to deliver a very high injection pressure directly into the combustion chamber. The 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 Formula 1 racing car engine used Bosch direct injection derived from wartime aircraft engines. Following this racetrack success, the 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL, the first production sports car to use fuel injection, used direct injection. The 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SLR, in which Stirling Moss drove to victory in the 1955 Mille Miglia and Pierre Levegh crashed and died in the 1955 Le Mans disaster, had an engine developed from the W196 engine. The Bosch fuel injectors were placed into the bores on the cylinder wall used by the spark plugs in other Mercedes-Benz six-cylinder engines (the spark plugs were relocated to the cylinder head). Later, more mainstream applications of fuel injection favored the less-expensive indirect injection methods.|$|E
50|$|The first {{automotive}} {{direct injection}} system {{used to run}} on gasoline was developed under Hans Scherenberg’s leadership, and was introduced by Goliath and Gutbrod in 1952 to power some of their two-stroke cars. This system made by Bosch was basically a high-pressure diesel direct-injection pump with an <b>intake</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> set up. (Diesels only change the amount of fuel injected to vary output; there is no throttle.) It used a normal gasoline fuel pump, to provide fuel to a mechanically driven injection pump, which had separate plungers per injector to deliver a very high injection pressure directly into the combustion chamber. The two-stroke vehicles showed very good performance and up to 30% less fuel consumption over the carburetor version, primarily under low engine loads. The cars enjoyed an extra benefit as the injection system also metered lubricant into the engine from a dedicated oil tank, obviating the need for owners to mix their own two-stroke fuel blend. A portion of the oil was combined with fuel in the injection pump to lubricate the cylinders and piston rings, the rest was ported to the air intake to lubricate the crankcase. But the cars were expensive and difficult to start when the engine was warm due to vapor locks. Also, very few people knew about direct injection, and the injection pumps needed frequent adjustment. Branded repair shops and Bosch services became overloaded, and many cars were converted to carburetor. These two-stroke engines were soon superseded by four-strokes.|$|E
50|$|When the {{accelerator}} is released, the butterfly valve that controls <b>intake</b> airflow (the <b>throttle</b> <b>valve)</b> is {{closed and the}} air flow through the intake is greatly restricted (but not cut off completely). This causes a high manifold vacuum which the cylinders have to work against - this saps energy and is {{where the majority of}} the engine braking force comes from. The concept can be illustrated by the amount of effort required to blow/suck through a narrow tube vs. a wider one. It is the work the engine has to do against this restricted air flow that provides the braking effect.|$|R

50|$|An {{exhaust brake}} works by causing a {{restriction}} in the exhaust, {{much like the}} <b>intake</b> <b>throttle</b> causes in a gasoline engine. In simple terms, it works by increasing the back-pressure of the exhaust.

40|$|Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) {{engines are}} one of the most {{promising}} engine technologies for the future of energy conversion from clean, efficient combustion. HCCI engines allow high efficiency and lower CO 2 emission through the use of high compression ratios and the removal of <b>intake</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>valves</b> (like Diesel), and allow very low levels of urban pollutants like nitric oxide and soot (like Otto). These engines, however, are not without their challenges, such as low power density compared with other engine technologies, and a difficulty in controlling combustion timing. This dissertation first addresses the power output limits. The particular strategies for enabling high power output investigated in this dissertation focus on avoiding five critical limits that either damage an engine, drastically reduce efficiency, or drastically increase emissions: 1) ringing limits, 2) peak in-cylinder pressure limits, 3) misfire limits, 4) low intake temperature limits, and 5) excessive emissions limits. The research shows that the key factors that enable high power output, sufficient for passenger vehicles, while simultaneously avoiding the five limits defined above are the use of: 1) high intake air pressures allowing improved power output, 2) highly delayed combustion timing to avoid ringing limits, and 3) using the highest possible equivalence ratio before encountering ringing limits. These results are revealed by conducting extensive experiments spanning a wide range of operating conditions on a multi-cylinder HCCI engine. Second, this dissertation discusses strategies for effectively sensing combustion characteristics on a HCCI engine. For effective feedback control of HCCI combustion timing, a sensor is required to quantify when combustion occurs. Many laboratory engines use in-cylinder pressure sensors but these sensors are currently prohibitively expensive for wide-scale commercialization. Instead, ion sensors made from inexpensive sparkplugs are proposed for sensing combustion timing. Ion sensing, however, is unreliable under certain HCCI conditions. The dissertation presents two strategies for improving the usefulness of ion sensors in HCCI engines: 1) the use of tiny fractions of metal-acetate fuel additives that expand the useful range of ion sensors, and 2) the use of ion sensors for detecting excessive ringing that must be avoided in HCCI engines. These two innovative research efforts make ion sensors viable for sensing combustion characteristics across the full range of HCCI operation, making them effective for use in engine control systems. In summary, this Ph. D dissertation addresses two important technical challenges facing HCCI engines: power output limits, and difficulty in sensing combustion characteristics for control applications. The strategies proposed in this dissertation research bring HCCI engines closer to widespread commercialization allowing vehicles to operate with significantly higher efficiency and with cleaner emissions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> is a {{technical}} device used for regulating a fluid or a gas flow. <b>Throttle</b> <b>valve</b> {{control is a}} challenging task, due to its complex dynamics and demanding constraints for the controller. Using state-of-the-art <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> control, such as model-free PID controllers, time-consuming and manual adjusting of the controller is necessary. In this paper, we investigate how reinforcement learning (RL) can help to alleviate the effort of manual controller design by automatically learning a control policy from experiences. In order to obtain a valid control policy for the <b>throttle</b> <b>valve,</b> several constraints need to be addressed, such as no-overshoot. Furthermore, the learned controller {{must be able to}} follow given desired trajectories, while moving the valve from any start to any goal position and, thus, multi-targets policy learning needs to be considered for RL. In this study, we employ a policy search RL approach, Pilco [2], to learn a <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> control policy. We adapt the Pilco algorithm, while taking into account the practical requirements and constraints for the controller. For evaluation, we employ the resulting algorithm to solve several control tasks in simulation, as well as on a physical <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> system. The results show that policy search RL is able to learn a consistent control policy for complex, real-world systems. ...|$|R
