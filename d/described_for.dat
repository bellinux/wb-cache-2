5|$|Mussie, {{also known}} as Hapyxelor or Hapaxelor, is a cryptid, an animal whose {{existence}} {{is the subject of}} folklore but has not been proven, that is rumored to live in Muskrat Lake in the Canadian province of Ontario. The creature's age, gender, and physical appearance are not agreed upon; it is variously <b>described,</b> <b>for</b> example, as a walrus or as a three-eyed Loch Ness Monster-like creature. It is also not agreed upon whether Mussie is a single creature or a species.|$|E
5|$|The Iago sparrow {{was first}} {{collected}} by Charles Darwin {{during the first}} stop of the second voyage of HMS Beagle at the island of Santiago (St. Iago). It was <b>described</b> <b>for</b> him in 1837 by zoologist John Gould, in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, and given the name of Pyrgita iagoensis. By the time Gould wrote The Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle with Darwin and three other zoologists in 1841, he had placed the Iago sparrow in the genus Passer, where it remains. The genus, among the sparrows of the Old World in the family Passeridae, also contains at least 20 other species, among them the house sparrow and Eurasian tree sparrow.|$|E

5|$|The {{skull of}} Tarbosaurus was {{completely}} <b>described</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time}} in 2003. Scientists noted key differences between Tarbosaurus and the North American tyrannosaurids. Many of these differences are related to the handling of stress by the skull bones during a bite. When the upper jaw bit down on an object, force was transmitted up through the maxilla, the primary tooth-bearing bone of the upper jaw, into surrounding skull bones. In North American tyrannosaurids, this force went from the maxilla into the fused nasal bones on top of the snout, which were firmly connected in the rear to the lacrimal bones by bony struts. These struts locked the two bones together, suggesting that force was then transmitted from the nasals to the lacrimals.|$|E
5|$|True Thescelosaurus remains {{are known}} {{definitely}} only from late Maastrichtian-age rocks, from Alberta (Scollard Formation) and Saskatchewan (Frenchman Formation), Canada, and Wyoming (Lance Formation), South Dakota (Hell Creek Formation), Montana (Hell Creek), and Colorado (Laramie Formation), USA. With {{the exception of}} birds, {{it was one of}} the last genera of dinosaurs, its remains being found as close as 3meters to the boundary clay containing the iridium layer that closes the Cretaceous. There are reports of teeth from older, Campanian-age rocks, particularly from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, but these specimens are not from Thescelosaurus and are much more likely those of Orodromeus. More specimens are known than have been officially <b>described</b> <b>for</b> this genus, such as the Triebold specimen, which has been the source of several skeletal casts for museums.|$|E
