5|$|Though a {{few small}} factions broke with Smith's {{organization}} during his lifetime, he retained the allegiance {{of the vast majority}} of Latter Day Saints until his death in June 1844. Following Smith's death, the movement experienced a leadership crisis which led to a schism within the church. The largest group, which would become the LDS Church, followed Brigham Young, settling in what would become the Utah Territory. The second-largest faction, the RLDS Church, coalesced around Joseph Smith III, eldest son of Joseph Smith. Other would-be leaders included the senior surviving member of the First Presidency, Sidney Rigdon; the newly baptized James Strang from Wisconsin; and Alpheus Cutler, one of the Council of Fifty. Each of these men <b>still</b> retains a <b>following</b> <b>as</b> of 2014—however tiny it may be in some cases—and all of their organizations have experienced further schisms. Other claimants, such as Granville Hedrick, William Bickerton and Charles B. Thompson, later emerged to start still other factions, some of which have further subdivided.|$|R

40|$|Considering {{phenomenon}} of inter-institutional collaboration, the paper aims {{to investigate the}} issues of inter- institutional collaboration in Lithuanian public organizations. The paper {{is based on the}} study of collaboration aspects relevant to the project implemented by the Lithuanian Republic Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Based on theoretical discussion related to the success of project implementation and team work, two studies were conducted. Firstly, a sample comprised of seven project managers expressed the assumptions about decision-making process, obstacles of project implementation and measures for efficiency. Secondly, 65 responses were collected from project participants representing different public institutions. The results revealed that inter-institutional projects in public organizations are <b>still</b> characterized <b>as</b> <b>following</b> traditional and strictly hierarchic structure. The project leaders underestimate the potential of project group members and do not involve them into the decision-making process. The findings let us develop recommendations for managers and policy makers involved into inter-institutional projects...|$|R
