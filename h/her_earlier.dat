5|$|In {{the second}} part, David devotes {{chapters}} to recipes for {{various forms of}} baking. Bread comes first, followed by recipes for, among many other things, buns, yeast cakes, soda-bread, brioches, croissants, pain au chocolat, and pizza. As in <b>her</b> <b>earlier</b> books, the recipes are interspersed with excerpts from earlier authors, including Fernand Braudel, Auguste Escoffier, and the painter John Constable.|$|E
5|$|Iskak's search {{has little}} success until the sisters receive news {{that he is}} looking for them, and they quickly return to Batavia. There, the sisters are greeted with open arms. Iskak's wife regrets <b>her</b> <b>earlier</b> {{treatment}} of the girls and repents, treating them splendidly and supporting Dhalia's plans to open an orphanage.|$|E
5|$|Kelsey {{continued}} {{to work for the}} FDA while being recognised for <b>her</b> <b>earlier</b> work. She was still working at the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in 1995 and was appointed deputy for scientific and medical affairs. In 1994, the Frances Kelsey Secondary School in Mill Bay, British Columbia was named in her honour. She retired in 2005.|$|E
50|$|Relocating from Paris to Los Angeles {{because of}} the war, she {{continued}} her choreographic work. During the 1960s in London she directed the revival of <b>her</b> <b>early</b> ballet creations. <b>Her</b> <b>Early</b> Memoirs, translated into English, was published posthumously.|$|R
50|$|She {{was still}} in <b>her</b> <b>early</b> teens when she settled in Chicago. Part of <b>her</b> <b>early</b> career was spent singing at Dago Frank's, a brothel. She then sang at Hugh Hoskin's saloon and, eventually, in many Chicago bars.|$|R
50|$|Chasen began <b>her</b> <b>early</b> {{career as}} a {{publicist}} for her brother, film director Larry Cohen, who hired her as a publicist for his 1973 blaxploitation film, Hell Up in Harlem, which became one of <b>her</b> <b>earliest</b> jobs in the industry.|$|R
5|$|She {{mirrored}} <b>her</b> <b>earlier</b> {{performance at}} the season-ending WTA Tour Championships in Doha, Qatar, losing all three of her matches. Kuznetsova finished the year ranked No. 8, {{the only woman in}} the top ten not to have won a title that year.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In the episode, Mulder and Scully {{investigate}} a death fetishist who begins kidnapping and killing women to satisfy his obsession. Scully, still recovering from <b>her</b> <b>earlier</b> abduction, is soon overcome with posttraumatic stress disorder.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{previous}} actions of breaking into ISIS and hacking the mainframe, Archer is excused from his expenses after Cyril {{comes to the}} assumption that Kremenski had been stealing from Archer's account the whole time. Malory notes {{that she would have}} known if there was a mole at ISIS, <b>her</b> <b>earlier</b> phone call shown to have been with Nikolai Jakov, head of the KGB. She changes the subject when questioned, and rather complains that someone left donuts on the floor attracting ants.|$|E
50|$|Sharapova's 2008 Wimbledon {{campaign}} {{turned out}} to be short-lived, as she was defeated in the second round by Alla Kudryavtseva, in the process suffering <b>her</b> <b>earliest</b> ever defeat at Wimbledon, and <b>her</b> <b>earliest</b> defeat at a Major tournament since the 2003 US Open.|$|R
50|$|One of <b>her</b> <b>earliest</b> {{teachers}} was Hanya Holm.|$|R
50|$|During <b>her</b> <b>early</b> teens she was {{a member}} of the Girl Guides and the RSPCA. <b>Her</b> <b>early</b> {{ambition}} was to become a High School Teacher, to teach Economics and History. However, influenced by her mother’s chosen career of Nursing, at the age of 19, Trish became a nurse.|$|R
5|$|If Yuffie {{is present}} {{at the end of}} disc one, when Aerith Gainsborough is murdered by the party's nemesis Sephiroth, the player can witness an uncharacteristic display of emotion from the character, as she breaks down in Cloud's arms after failing to control her sobs. Yuffie's loyalty to the team is called into {{question}} after Cloud temporarily disbands his party ahead of their final confrontation with Sephiroth; when Yuffie is the last to return Barret Wallace suspects her of abandoning the team in light of <b>her</b> <b>earlier</b> treachery at Wutai. When Yuffie returns to the group she subsequently rebukes Barrett for his judgement.|$|E
5|$|In November 2001, Spears {{began her}} Dream Within a Dream Tour in Columbus, Ohio; it ended in July 2002 in Dallas, Texas. An {{accompanying}} video album was released, titled , on November 20, 2001 through Jive Records. Made available {{less than three}} weeks after Britney, Britney: The Videos included a selection of <b>her</b> <b>earlier</b> music videos, behind-the-scenes footage, commercials, and notable live performances. It peaked at number one on the US Top Music Videos on December 8, 2001.|$|E
5|$|In both later {{works such}} as Caroline Mordaunt and <b>her</b> <b>earlier</b> evangelical texts, Sherwood participated in the Victorian project of {{prescribing}} gender roles; while her later works outlined ever more stringent and narrow roles for each sex, her early {{works such as}} The Fairchild Family suggested such demarcations as well: Lucy and Emily learn to sew and keep house while Henry tends the garden and learns Latin.|$|E

5|$|Let Go is {{the debut}} studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne, {{released}} on 4 June 2002. For {{a year after}} signing a record deal with Arista, Lavigne struggled due to conflicts in musical direction. She relocated to Los Angeles, California, and recorded there, <b>her</b> <b>earlier</b> materials for the album; the kind of sound to which the label was not amenable. She was paired to the production team The Matrix, who understood her vision for the album.|$|E
5|$|Sam Black (Gabrielle Anwar) {{replaced}} Julie as {{the head}} of the graphics team in the second series. Sam is very fashion conscious and a flirt, and is surprised when an actor rejects her advances in favour of Sarah. Anwar had auditioned for the role of Lynda. (Many actors who unsuccessfully auditioned for main characters were invited back later for guest roles.) Moffat had expanded the role of Julie after the first series, but Lucy Benjamin was unavailable for series two. Sam, therefore, was basically the character of Julie under a different name, especially in <b>her</b> <b>earlier</b> episodes.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan had}} been to take the songs out on the road, but no new tour transpired. Thus, Bush {{deliberately}} aimed for a live-band feel, with less of the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums and {{which would have been}} too difficult to re-create on stage. The result alienated some of her fan base, who had enjoyed the intricacy of <b>her</b> <b>earlier</b> compositions, but others found a new complexity in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed.|$|E

5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of <b>her</b> <b>earlier</b> records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E
5|$|Curie's {{systematic}} studies {{included two}} uranium minerals, pitchblende and torbernite (also known as chalcolite). Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was {{four times as}} active as uranium itself, and chalcolite twice as active. She concluded that, if <b>her</b> <b>earlier</b> results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium. She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive. Pierre was increasingly intrigued by her work. By mid-1898 he was so invested in it {{that he decided to}} drop his work on crystals and to join her.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in town, Mike meets up {{with his}} friends, the Terenzi {{brothers}} (Michael Siegel and Peter Licassi), and using the intercom on an ice cream truck, they drive around town attempting to warn people of the invading klowns. At Debbie's house, popcorn stuck to her clothes from <b>her</b> <b>earlier</b> encounter with the klowns mutates into monsters and attack her. She fends off the creatures, but another group of klowns arrive and trap her in a giant balloon. Mike, Dave, and the Terenzis witness Debbie's capture and give chase, following the klowns to an amusement park, and the relocated circus tent. Journeying through a funhouse leading to the klowns' lair, the Terenzi brothers become separated and meet two female-looking klowns. After Dave and Mike witness a klown using a crazy straw to drink liquefied townspeople, they rescue Debbie and flee into a maze full of tricks and traps.|$|E

5|$|Having been {{diagnosed}} with cancer, Scully is unsure of her future with the FBI. Mulder is convinced that her condition {{is a result of}} <b>her</b> <b>earlier</b> abduction ("Ascension"), and is prepared to make a deal with the Syndicate to find a cure. He is dissuaded by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who secretly makes such a deal instead. While being pursued by an assassin responsible for a hoax alien corpse discovered on a mountaintop, Mulder fakes his own suicide, mutilating the assassin's face to provide a decoy body. He uses the distraction this offers to infiltrate The Pentagon to find a cure for Scully's cancer, while Scully is able to uncover and reveal a Syndicate connection within the FBI.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Hepburn {{starred in}} the dark-comedy Grace Quigley, {{the story of an}} elderly woman who enlists a hitman (Nick Nolte) to kill her. Hepburn found humor in the morbid theme, but reviews were {{negative}} and the box-office was poor. In 1985, she presented a television documentary about the life and career of Spencer Tracy. The majority of Hepburn's roles from this point were in television movies, which did not receive the critical praise of <b>her</b> <b>earlier</b> work in the medium but remained popular with audiences. With each release, Hepburn would declare it her final screen appearance, but she continued to take on new roles. She received an Emmy nomination for 1986's Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry, then two years later returned for the comedy Laura Lansing Slept Here, which allowed her to act with her grandniece, Schuyler Grant.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to acting, Zinta {{has written a}} series of columns for BBC News Online South Asia, she is a social activist, a television presenter, and a regular stage performer. She {{is the founder of}} the production company PZNZ Media, a co-owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Kings XI Punjab since 2008, and the owner of the South-African T20 Global League cricket team Stellenbosch Kings since 2017. Zinta is known in the Indian media for publicly speaking her mind and openly expressing her opinions, and consequently has sparked the occasional controversy. These controversies include her being the only witness not to retract in court <b>her</b> <b>earlier</b> statements against the Indian mafia during the 2003 Bharat Shah case, for which she was awarded the Godfrey Phillips National Bravery Award.|$|E
