Staying alive through the consolation bracket Evans pinned his next opponent before being matched up with legend Greg Jones, a 3x National Champion who would finish his college career with a record of 126-4. Evans won the match via 3-2 decision, becoming one of only 4 people to defeat Jones in his college career. Evans lost his next match, which would have qualified him for [...] All-American status, in a close 3-2 decision, ending his college career. He finished his career at Michigan State with a record of 48 wins and 34 losses.|$|E

The ordinary habiliments of an English gentleman are so sombre that his own eye is gratified, and he feels that he has placed himself in the vanguard of society by thus shining in his apparel.
