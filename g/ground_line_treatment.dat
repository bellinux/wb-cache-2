40|$|Paleoglaciology {{is an area}} of {{research}} where numerical reconstruction is actively used to understand the process of ice sheet growth and decay throughout past glacial periods, and numerical simulation of ice dynamics is a tool to reproduce the behaviors of the ice sheet and shelf under given conditions. ARCTIC-TARAH, designed by the Bolin Centre for Climate Research for simulating ice sheet dynamics, is developed based on the Pennsylvania State University Ice sheet model (PSUI). We arrange ARCTIC-TARAH for the simulation of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS), which periodically appears in the northwestern corner over North America during glacial periods, and simulate for 30, 000 years in order for the researchers at the Bolin Centre to be able to perform real CIS paleo-simulations in the future. Based on the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the Mid-Holocene (MH), and the presenttime (PT) climate data, several different experiments are run for arbitrary 10, 000 - 30, 000 years. We discuss the potential problems of the CIS simulation and suggest further improvements on the model. The major issues encountered are (1) the basal topography, (2) <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> <b>treatments,</b> and (3) the climate setting. Both the steep and jagged surface of a mountain range and the basal topography near the edge of a continental slope require close attention for numerical stability. Because the topography in some areas of the coastline is very steep and the width ofthe continental slope is narrow, there is a large amount of ice mass that flows out into the ocean from land. The transition zone between the ice sheet and shelf may approach the continental slope in a relatively short time. This large volume flux across the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> on the steep seabed overwhelms the stability of the model. In addition, the model uses a PDD (positive-degree-day) method to approximate the budget of ice accumulation and ablation. We suggest either implementing a better PDD method or coupling it with a climate model to capture the coastal and continental climate characteristics, as well as the local extreme climate in the mountains and along the coast...|$|R

The aim of this paper is to assess the ability of simple versions of existing marine ice sheet models to simulate <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> migration. In particular, we investigate the response of the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> to external forcing and the sensitivity of the models' predictions to their numerics and the mechanical coupling between ice sheet and shelf. From the model comparison, there is no consensus on how the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> should react to changes in boundary conditions.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the flow of}} marine-terminating outlet glaciers that are laterally confined in a channel of prescribed width. In that case, the drag exerted by the channel side walls on a floating ice shelf can reduce extensional stress at the <b>grounding</b> <b>line.</b> If ice flux through the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> increases with both ice thickness and extensional stress, then a longer shelf can reduce ice flux by decreasing extensional stress. Consequently, calving {{has an effect on}} flux through the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> by regulating the length of the shelf. In the absence of a shelf, it plays a similar role by controlling the above-flotation height of the calving cliff. Using two calving laws, one due to Nick et al.  (2010) based on a model for crevasse propagation due to hydrofracture and the other simply asserting that calving occurs where the glacier ice becomes afloat, we pose and analyse a flowline model for a marine-terminating glacier by two methods: direct numerical solution and matched asymptotic expansions. The latter leads to a boundary layer formulation that predicts flux through the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> as a function of depth to bedrock, channel width, basal drag coefficient, and a calving parameter. By contrast with unbuttressed marine ice sheets, we find that flux can decrease with increasing depth to bedrock at the <b>grounding</b> <b>line,</b> reversing the usual stability criterion for steady <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> location. Stable steady states can then have <b>grounding</b> <b>lines</b> located on retrograde slopes.

40|$|Recent studies {{point out}} the {{relationship}} between global environmental change and retreat of Antarctic ice sheet. <b>Grounding</b> <b>line</b> is a marginal zone where grounded continental ice sheet flow out to the ocean and just start to afloat {{and is one of}} the important parameters for the estimation of ice mass flux at Antarctica. However the precise position and detailed feature of <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> haven 2 ̆ 7 t decided because its positions difficult to find from surface of ice sheet. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a microwave imaging sensor and SAR sensor illuminate microwave to the ground, then observe its backscattered microwave from ground, interferometric SAR (InSAR) is an application technique of SAR data to measure the line-of-sight distance change using a pair of SAR data and most suitable technique for the detection of <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> because InSAR can detect the tidal motion of ice shelf. Extracted <b>grounding</b> <b>lines</b> are geometrically corrected and projected onto Polar Stereographic Coordinate and compared with conventional dataset which name is ADD. Planimetric difference of <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> between ADD and InSAR extracted one attains to 5000 m at Riisar Larsen Peninsula, East Antarctica and 9500 m at Burke Island, West Antarctica. In this study we confirmed the effectiveness of InSAR technique and revealed the incompleteness and inaccuracy of ADD data. Then, we plan to develop <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> database at whole Antarctica. The icesheet-iceshelf boundary mainly laid at three regions on Antarctica, where East Antarctica(25 °W- 400 °E), West Antarctica (85 °W- 165 °W) and Antarctic Peninsula (50 °W- 60 °W). We also introduce the development plan of this database...|$|R
40|$|Marine ice {{sheets are}} {{continental}} ice masses resting on bedrock below sea level. Their dynamics {{are similar to}} those of land-based ice sheets except that they must couple with the surrounding floating ice shelves at the <b>grounding</b> <b>line,</b> where the ice reaches a critical flotation thickness. In order to predict the evolution of the ground-ing line as a free boundary, two boundary conditions are required for the diffusion equation describing the evolution of the grounded-ice thickness. By analogy with Stefan problems, one of these conditions imposes a prescribed ice thickness at the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> and arises from the fact that the ice becomes afloat. The other condition must be determined by coupling the ice sheet to the surrounding ice shelves. Here we employ matched asymptotic expansions to study the transition from ice-sheet to ice-shelf flow for the case of rapidly sliding ice sheets. Our principal results are that the ice flux at the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> in a two-dimensional ice sheet is an increasing function of the depth of the sea floor there, and that ice thicknesses at the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> must be small compared with ice thicknesses inland. These results indicate that marine ice sheets have a discrete set of steady surface profiles (if they have any at all) and that the stability of these steady profiles depends on the slope of the sea floor at the <b>grounding</b> <b>line.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|The 120 m sea-level drop {{during the}} Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 18 â�� 22 kyr BP) had a {{profound}} impact on the global tides and lead to an increased tidal dissipation rate, especially in the North Atlantic. Here, we present new simulations of the evolution of the global tides from the LGM to present for the dominating diurnal and semidiurnal constituents. The simulations are undertaken in time slices spanning 500 â�� 1000 years. Due to uncertainties in the location of the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> of the Antarctic ice sheets during the last glacial, simulations are carried out for two different <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> scenarios. Our results replicate previously reported enhancements in dissipation and amplitudes of the semidiurnal tide during LGM and subsequent deglaciation, and they provide a detailed picture of the large global changes in M 2 tidal dynamics occurring over the deglaciation period. We show that Antarctic ice dynamics and the associated <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> location have a large influence on global semidiurnal tides, whereas the diurnal tides mainly experience regional changes and are not impacted by <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> shifts in Antarctica...|$|R
40|$|The Institute Ice Stream (IIS) in West Antarctica may be {{increasingly}} vulnerable to melting at the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> through modifications in ocean circulation. Understanding such change requires knowledge of grounding-line boundary conditions, including the topography {{on which it}} rests. Here, we discuss evidence from new radio-echo sounding (RES) data on the subglacial topography adjacent to the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> of the IIS. In doing so, we reveal a previously unknown subglacial embayment immediately inland of the IIS grounding zone which is not represented in the Bedmap 2 compilation. We discuss {{whether there is an}} open-water connection between the embayment and the ice-shelf cavity. The exact location of the <b>grounding</b> <b>line</b> over the embayment {{has been the subject of}} considerable uncertainty, with several positions being proposed recently. From our compilation of data, we are able to explain which of these <b>grounding</b> <b>lines</b> is most likely and, in doing so, highlight the need for accurate bed topography in conjunction with satellite observations to fully comprehend ice-sheet processes in this region and other vulnerable locations at the grounded margin of Antarctica...|$|R
