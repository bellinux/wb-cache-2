5|$|The sleeve {{front cover}} used a {{black-and-white}} still from The Man Who Fell to Earth, in which Bowie, as the character Thomas Jerome Newton, {{steps into the}} space capsule that will return him to his home planet. Bowie had insisted on the cropped black-and-white image as he felt that in the original coloured full-size image the sky looked artificial; when Rykodisc reissued Bowie's catalogue in the early 1990s the colour version was used. The back cover showed Bowie sketching the Kabbalah Sephirot with chalk—something he had been <b>doing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set of the film.|$|E
5|$|Lex {{makes his}} first {{appearance}} outside of the television series in the novel Smallville: Strange Visitors, published by Aspect. When a couple of con artists arrive in Smallville promoting miracle cures created by the meteor rocks, Lex becomes interested in what they are really after, as he believes their plans could hinder the research he is <b>doing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> meteor rocks. After Jacobi and Wolfe's con is realized, Lex uses a dummy corporation to steal all of the meteor rocks Jacobi's Ascendence Foundation has collected. In Smallville: Dragon, Lex throws a party at his mansion for the local teenagers, that is ultimately crashed by a repitilian creature that {{was created by the}} meteor rocks. He is also visited by an old flame, Renata, who shows up looking to rekindle their relationship. Lex quickly discovers that she has an ulterior motive when she propositions him to fund a drug deal, which prompts Lex to realize that she was really sent by his father as some test for Lex.|$|E
25|$|James Joule {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between heat, work, and temperature.

He proposed that the mechanical work he was <b>doing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> system was converted to thermal energy. Specifically, he found that 4185.5 joules of energy were needed to raise the temperature of a kilogram of water by one degree Celsius.|$|E

Chiefs with seventeen years of service are quitting. I've got to teach these kids to push the right button, or they'll blow us to kingdom come! My butt is on the line!" [...] He added that if he died at sea, {{he wanted to be}} buried at sea. Before leaving Norfolk in early April 1989, Third Class Gunner's Mate Scot Blakey, a member of Turret Two's crew, told his sister, Julie Blakey, [...] "I'm not thrilled with some of the things we're <b>doing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Iowa. We shouldn't be doing them. Something could go wrong." [...] When Julie asked, [...] "Why are you doing them?" [...] Scot replied, [...] "We don't have a choice." ...|$|E
500|$|By February 1969, Redding {{had grown}} weary of Hendrix's {{unpredictable}} {{work ethic and}} his creative control over the Experience's music. During the previous month's European tour, interpersonal relations within the group had deteriorated, particularly between Hendrix and Redding. In his diary, Redding documented the building frustration during early 1969 recording sessions: [...] "On the first day, as I nearly expected, there was nothing <b>doing...</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> second it was no show at all. I went to the pub for three hours, came back, {{and it was still}} ages before Jimi ambled in. Then we argued... On the last day, I just watched it happen for a while, and then went back to my flat." [...] The last Experience sessions that included Redding—a re-recording of [...] "Stone Free" [...] for use as a possible single release—took place on April 14 at Olmstead and the Record Plant in New York. Hendrix then flew bassist Billy Cox to New York; they started recording and rehearsing together on April 21.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2006, Launch Radio Networks {{reported}} that Sully Erna has {{started working on}} his solo album. Although he wasn't exactly sure what shape it will take, Erna told Launch Radio Networks that [...] "I've been putting some thought into it," [...] he said. [...] "I actually have some stuff that I'm <b>doing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side right now.

2500|$|Oldfield later {{turned to}} film and video, writing the score for Roland Joffé's {{acclaimed}} film The Killing Fields and producing substantial video footage for his album Islands. Islands continued what Oldfield had been <b>doing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{past couple of}} albums, with an instrumental piece {{on one side and}} rock/pop singles on the other. Of these, [...] "Islands", sung by Bonnie Tyler and [...] "Magic Touch", with vocals by Max Bacon (in the US version) and Glasgow vocalist Jim Price (Southside Jimmy) {{in the rest of the}} world, were the major hits. In the US [...] "Magic Touch" [...] reached the top 10 on the Billboard album rock charts in 1988. During the 1980s, Oldfield's then-wife, Norwegian singer Anita Hegerland, contributed vocals to many songs including [...] "Pictures in the Dark".|$|E

2500|$|Production {{went very}} well, and as {{expected}} {{with so many}} comic actors and personalities around, was very lively. During production, Hudlin said that whenever David Alan Grier and Martin Lawrence worked, the film's crew usually worked a little slower because wherever they were, there {{would be so much}} comedy being generated and they were so funny that everyone wanted to hang out near where they were throughout the day. In the scene where the new fragrance is being presented to Strangé, the director said that [...] "what Grace was <b>doing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set while we were shooting was so funny that I remember Halle crying off camera, cause she was trying to keep a straight face but she couldn't. So whenever she was off-camera, she would just be literally crying because she was laughing so hard. And fortunately, for her reaction shots she was able to recover." ...|$|E
2500|$|In The Avengers #75 (April 1970), the Scarlet Witch is reintroduced to {{the team}} and soon becomes a love {{interest}} for the Vision. Thomas recounted, [...] "I felt that a romance of some sort would help the character development in The Avengers, and the Vision was a prime candidate because he appeared only in that mag... as did Wanda, for that matter. So they became a pair, for just such practical considerations. It would also, I felt, add to the development I was <b>doing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Vision's attempting to become ‘human.’" [...] Thomas also {{came up with the}} idea of the Vision having been created from the body of the Human Torch, but only planted a vague clue to this (in The Avengers #93) before leaving the series. It was finally followed up in The Avengers #134–135. Writer Steve Englehart explained, [...] "That plot was well known in-house for years, and since Roy [...] and Neal [...] hadn't had a chance to do it, I did it on my watch with Roy’s blessing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ash's {{first episode}} as Vanessa was watched by 5.73 million viewers. It was {{selected}} as recommended viewing by the Daily Post and Daily Mirror, with The Mirror Jane Simon commenting: [...] "Ash looks terrific despite being lumbered with big owlish glasses just like the ones that Manda (Josie Lawrence) has to wear in EastEnders. This {{seems to be a}} new kind of wardrobe department shorthand for: 'You may remember me from shows that were popular in the 80s.'" [...] Asked whether he was happy with the reception she had received, Tony McHale told Inside Soap: [...] "I am, but we knew that there would be the odd headline that would have a dig at certain things. Viewers seem to have taken to her, though, and enjoy what she's <b>doing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show. It was a good idea not to bring Leslie in as a goody two-shoes type, I think - Vanessa is a very complex character." [...] In November 2009, Antony Sumara, CEO of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Hospital Trust, wrote a column criticizing Holby City and its sister-show Casualty for misrepresenting real hospital life. Anne Pickles of the News and Star commented on the piece: [...] "Holby always was close in nature to a cheap airport paperback page-turner. But it has become even more so with the arrival of Leslie Ash, who actually has the same job as Antony Sumara – though it's doubtful he has her trout pout or stiff, barking old sergeant major demeanour." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, Norwood {{introduced}} her rap alter ego Bran'Nu on Timbaland's album Shock Value II (2009), {{the result of}} artistic experimentation with the musician, who had tapped her for her rhyming ability after seeing a video on YouTube that Norwood had uploaded and showed her rapping freestyle. Norwood, who had initially thought of rapping as a hobby and fun for friends, felt encouraged by Timbaland to write and perform her own verses on at least three tracks for his album, two of which eventually {{made it to the}} track lisiting. In December 2009, the producer revealed his intentions to reteam with her on her next project, producing the bulk of an album that he envisioned to be “half singing, half rapping”. Norwood confirmed his idea in an interview she held at the release party of Shock Value II: [...] "What I'm <b>doing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> [...] album is a little bit different than what everybody knows me for. Timbaland endorsed that [...] He really gave me a shot to be different and be versatile. I can't thank him enough for that. This is a wonderful opportunity." [...] Though Norwood went on to record several other rap songs the following months and hoped it would eventually lead to a signing with Timbaland's Mosley Music Group, plans for hip hop-oriented album under his imprint were eventually abandoned as the singer felt the sound would not aim at her core audience. Approached on the subject, she later dismissed the idea of recording a rap album, stating that “it was a hobby. I was convinced to do it professionally, which I never should have listened to that advice.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, Jim Kaat was {{the lead}} analyst on Baseball Tonight for ESPN's {{coverage}} of Major League Baseball. In 1995, he {{was nominated for a}} New York Emmy Award for [...] "On Camera Achievement." [...] Also in , Kaat called the American League playoffs with Brent Musburger for ABC/The Baseball Network including the Yankees–Seattle Mariners Division Series. He served his second stint as an announcer for Yankees games on the MSG Network/YES Network (–), where his straight-shooting style was much in the mode of former Yankees broadcasters Tony Kubek and Bill White. Towards the end of his second stint with the Yankees, his workload decreased. In 2006, he only broadcast 65 games. Despite his decreased work load, Kaat won another Emmy for on-air achievement in 2006. In an on-air broadcast on September 10, [...] with booth partner Ken Singleton, Kaat acknowledged his plan to end his broadcasting career. His final appearance in the booth was to be a Yankee–Red Sox game on September 15, 2006 (Kaat was also set to throw out the first pitch). However, the game was postponed due to rain. Kaat later announced {{that he was going to}} record a special farewell message to the fans, but would not return for any additional broadcasts. However, the following day, Kaat did announce one full inning of the first game of Saturday September 16's doubleheader on Fox along with Tim McCarver and Josh Lewin. During that Fox telecast he was able to say goodbye to the Yankee fans, an opportunity that the previous night's rainout had deprived him of <b>doing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> YES Network. In , Kaat joined the recently launched MLB Network as a color commentator for their Thursday Night Baseball series. Kaat also writes a weekly on-line blog for the Yankees (YES) Network, Kaat's Korner, and contributes video blogs and interviews regularly with national and international media outlets. One of the reasons he got back into regular broadcasting was because after his wife died, Tim McCarver and Elizabeth Schumacher, his friend and business manager, urged him to get back into the game. He also called Pool D in Puerto Rico for the 2009 World Baseball Classic games for an international feed.|$|E
