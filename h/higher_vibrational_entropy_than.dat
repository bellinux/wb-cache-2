Key inputs to these models are thermophysical properties of point defects and their clusters, which may be strong functions of temperature and cluster size. In this paper, a theoretical framework is presented for probing the high-thermodynamic properties of vacancy and self-interstitial clusters in crystalline silicon at elevated temperature. In particular, configurational and <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> are shown to be significant in both types of defect clusters. In both cases, configurational entropy leads {{to the existence of}} a wide distribution of possible cluster configurations that collectively lowers the free energy of formation relative to the energetic ground state configuration. Moreover, certain self-interstitial cluster sizes are additionally stabilized by configurations that possess anomalously <b>high</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy...</b>|$|R

This structure, which is reported as stable in the assessed Al-Fe phase diagram, is distinguished by an unusually low triclinic symmetry.

The <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropies</b> of formation span a wide range from - 0. 64 to + 0. 55 kB/atom, and the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropies</b> of alloying ranged from - 0. 39 to + 1. 0 kB/atom. This range exceeds the range of configurational entropy of a binary alloy, which reaches a maximum value of + 0. 69 kB/atom and a minimum value of 0 k B /atom. The <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of the NiTi martensitic transition was measured using low-temperature calorimetry and inelastic neutron-scattering. The high-temperature B 2 phase of NiTi has a <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> 0. 5 k B /atom larger than the low-temperature martensitic phase. The difference in <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> accounts for the total entropy of the austenitic-martensitic phase transition. Inelastic neutron scattering was used to show that the phonon DOS of V is unchanged between 20 and 1000 °C, inconsistent with the phonon softening expected from thermal expansion. It is found that the effects of volume expansion and rising temperature exert equal and opposite shifts on the phonon DOS. The pure temperature dependence of the phonon DOS is due to strong phonon-phonon scattering, which in turn leads to a large anharmonic <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> contribution at <b>high</b> temperature.

40|$|The {{phase diagram}} of model {{anisotropic}} particles with four attractive patches in a tetrahedral arrangement has been computed at two different {{values for the}} range of the potential, with the aim of investigating the conditions under which a diamond crystal can be formed. We find that the diamond phase is never stable for our longer-ranged potential. At low temperatures and pressures, the fluid freezes into a body-centred-cubic solid that can be viewed as two interpenetrating diamond lattices with a weak interaction between the two sublattices. Upon compression, an orientationally ordered face-centred-cubic crystal becomes more stable than the body-centred-cubic crystal, and at higher temperatures a plastic face-centered-cubic phase is stabilized by the increased entropy due to orientational disorder. A similar phase diagram is found for the shorter-ranged potential, but at low temperatures and pressures, we also find a region over which the diamond phase is thermodynamically favored over the body-centred-cubic phase. The <b>higher</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of the diamond structure with respect to the body-centred-cubic solid explains why it is stable even though the enthalpy of the latter phase is lower. Some preliminary studies on the growth of the diamond structure starting from a crystal seed were performed. Even though the diamond phase is never thermodynamically stable for the longer-ranged model, direct coexistence simulations of the interface between the fluid and the body-centred-cubic crystal and between the fluid and the diamond crystal show that, at sufficiently low pressures, it is quite probable that in both cases the solid grows into a diamond crystal, albeit involving some defects. These results highlight the importance of kinetic effects in the formation of diamond crystals in systems of patchy particles. Comment: 15 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

40|$|A {{relation}} between <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> and particles mean square displacement is derived in super-cooled liquids, {{assuming that the}} main effect of temperature changes is to rescale the vibrational spectrum. Deviations from this relation, in particular due to the presence of a Boson Peak whose shape and frequency changes with temperature, are estimated. Using observations of the short-time dynamics in liquids of various fragility, it is argued that (i) if the crystal entropy is significantly smaller <b>than</b> the liquid <b>entropy</b> at T_g, the extrapolation of the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> leads to the correlation T_K≈ T_ 0, where T_K is the Kauzmann temperature and T_ 0 is the temperature extracted from the Vogel-Fulcher fit of the viscosity. (ii) The jump in specific heat associated with <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> is very small for strong liquids, and increases with fragility. The analysis suggests that these correlations stem from the stiffening of the Boson Peak under cooling, underlying the importance of this phenomenon on the dynamical arrest.

40|$|Phonon {{densities of}} states (DOS) of bcc α-^ 57 Fe were {{measured}} from room temperature through the 1044 K Curie transition and the 1185 K fcc γ-Fe phase transition using nuclear resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. At higher temperatures all phonons shift to lower energies (soften) with thermal expansion, but the low transverse modes soften especially rapidly above 700 K, showing strongly nonharmonic behavior that persists through the magnetic transition. Interatomic force constants for the bcc phase {{were obtained by}} iteratively fitting a Born-von Kármán model to the experimental phonon spectra using a genetic algorithm optimization. The second-nearest-neighbor fitted axial force constants weakened significantly at elevated temperatures. An unusually large nonharmonic behavior is reported, which increases the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> and accounts for a contribution of 35 meV/atom in the free energy at high temperatures. The nonharmonic contribution to the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> follows the thermal trend of the magnetic entropy, and may be coupled to magnetic excitations. A small change in <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> across the α-γ structural phase transformation is also reported...|$|R
40|$|Solid-solid {{transformations in}} Pd-Pt nanoalloys {{in the size}} range 32 - 38 atoms and for {{different}} compositions are computationally studied by the superposition approximation to the partition function, and by molecular dynamics simulations. A broad spectrum of transition types is shown to take place. These transition types are: (i) one-to-one type, in which the global minimum, which is dominant at low temperatures, transforms into another single isomer with increasing temperature; (ii) one-to-many type, in which the transition is from a single isomer to a family of other isomers; (iii) many-to-many type, in which the transition is between two different families of isomers; (iv) many-to-one type, in which the effect of <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> is to greatly {{reduce the number of}} relevant structures with increasing temperatures. We provide a rationale for these behaviors, which stem from the interplay between energetics and <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> effects. The <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> is explained by analyzing the vibrational density of states and the specific features of the normal modes. Quantum effects on the structural transitions are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} new calorimetric data on {{the excess}} heat capacity and <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of mixing of Pt–Rh and Ag–Pd alloys. The results of the latter alloy are compared to those obtained by calculations using the density functional theory. The extent of the excess <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of mixing of these binaries and of some already investigated binary mixtures {{is related to the}} differences of the end-member volumes and the end-member bulk moduli. These quantities are used to roughly represent the changes of the bond length and stiffness in the substituted and substituent polyhedra due to compositional changes, which are assumed to be the important factors for the non-ideal vibrational behaviour in solid solutions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{literature}} on vibrational thermodynamics of materials is reviewed. The {{emphasis is on}} metals and alloys, especially on the progress {{over the last decade}} in understanding differences in the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of different alloy phases and phase transformations. Some results on carbides, nitrides, oxides, hydrides and lithium-storage materials are also covered. Principles of harmonic phonons in alloys are organized into thermodynamic models for unmixing and ordering transformations on an Ising lattice, and extended for non-harmonic potentials. Owing to the high accuracy required for the phonon frequencies, quantitative predictions of <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> with analytical models prove elusive. Accurate tools for such calculations or measurements were challenging for many years, but are more accessible today. Ab-initio methods for calculating phonons in solids are summarized. The experimental techniques of calorimetry, inelastic neutron scattering, and inelastic x-ray scattering are explained with enough detail to show the issues of using these methods for investigations of vibrational thermodynamics. The explanations extend to methods of data analysis that affect the accuracy of thermodynamic information. It is sometimes possible to identify the structural and chemical origins of the differences in <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of materials, and the number of these assessments is growing. There has bee...|$|R
40|$|The {{vibrational}} {{properties of}} materials are essential to understanding material stability and thermodynamics. In this thesis I outline vibrational thermodynamic models and the experimental tools that provide evidence on phonon behavior. The introductory section discusses the history of metallurgy and thermodynamic theory, {{with an emphasis on}} the role of iron and cementite, two important components of steels. The thermodynamic framework for understanding vibrational material behavior is provided alongside the growing body of experimental and computational tools that provide physical insight on <b>vibrational</b> properties. The <b>high</b> temperature <b>vibrational</b> behavior of iron and cementite are explored within this context in the final chapters. Body-centered-cubic iron exhibits decreasing phonon energies at elevated temperatures. The observed energy change in not uniform across phonon modes in iron, and specific phonon modes show significant decreases in energy that are not explained by simple vibrational models. This anomalously energy decrease is linked to the second-nearest-neighbor interactions in the bcc structure, through examination of fitted interatomic force constants. The large changes in phonon energy result in {{a significant increase in the}} <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy,</b> called the nonharmonic <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy,</b> which emulates the temperature behavior of the magnetic entropy across the Curie temperature. The nonharmonic <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> is attributed to interactions between the vibrations and state of magnetic disorder in the material, which persists above the magnetic transitions and extends the stability region of the bcc phase. Orthorombic cementite, Fe 3 C, exhibits anisotropic magneto-volume behavior in the ferromagnetic phase including regions very low thermal expansion. The phonon modes of cementite show anomalous temperature dependence, with low energy phonon modes increasing their energy at elevated temperatures in the ferromagnetic phase. This behavior is reversed after the magnetic transition and these same phonon modes lower their energies with temperature, consistent with observed thermal expansion. This atypical phonon behavior lowers the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of cementite up to the Curie temperature. The experimentally observed increase in low energy acoustic phonons affects the elastic behavior of Fe 3 C, increasing the isotropy of elastic response. First principles calculations link the observed phonon energy increases to specific vibrational modes that are polarized along the b-axis, which aligns with the closest Fe-Fe bonding direction. The nonharmonic behavior of the vibrational modes are discussed in the context of other observations of anomalous anisotropic magneto-volume behavior in Fe 3 C. </p...|$|R
40|$|A close {{inspection}} of neutron spectra of glass formers {{in the frequency}} region above the boson peak does not show the constant eigenvalue density expected for a random dynamical matrix, but a slow decrease towards higher eigenvalues. In 1, 4 -polybutadiene and selenium, the slope becomes steeper with increasing temperature in the undercooled liquid, suggesting an influence of the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy.</b> One can describe the behaviour quantitatively {{in terms of a}} balance between level repulsion (from the randomness of the dynamical matrix) and <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy.</b> On the basis of this evidence, the boson peak must be a crossover from such a balance at higher frequencies to a mixture of sound waves and additional excitations at low frequency.
