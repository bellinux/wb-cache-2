5000|$|Casa Cosmana Navarra {{was one of}} the few {{residential}} houses {{built in}} the 17th-century in Rabat, the suburb of Mdina, as building outside fortified cities was not encouraged. Cosmana Navarra (born Guzmana Cumbo; when married, Cassar; known by her mother's surname as Navarra) was the daughter of Gakbu Cumbo and Cornelia Cumbo (née Navarra), of the Cumbo-Navarra family. On 22 June 1625, at the age of 25, she got married to her only lifetime husband Lorenzo Cassar in the (previous) Cathedral of Imdina. The marriage was childless, in which case gave Cosmana Navarra more time to dedicate for the building of her house and the restructuring of the parish church in Rabat, Malta. Cosmana Navarra was a devotee of St. Paul and this is shown by her interest and actions involved with the St. Paul pilgrimage site in Rabat of St. Paul’s Cave (Grotto), at the now Wignacourt Museum. She was a main philanthropist for the re-construction of the parish church that was aimed to receive several pilgrims from Europe; that can be considered a historic <b>development</b> <b>in</b> <b>tourism</b> in Malta. She made sure that Casa Cosmana Navarra and the Wignacourt Museum are both featured as the main building at opposite sides of each other in front the church, of which both are corner buildings. Through her father her surname was Cumbo and with marriage she became officially Cassar but she was always referred to by her mother's surname as Navarra.Cosmana was the mastermind after the various parts of the rebuilding of St. Paul Parish Church [...] that stands just outside her cornered townhouse, Casa Cosmana Navarra. The new design on the church was given to Lorenzo Gafa according to Cosmana's choice. Works on the parish church started in 1653 but stopped shortly in 1662, to then continue in 1664. A document dated to 19 April 1664 says that Cosmana paid 1700 scudi for the continuation of the project which had stopped in 1662. In 1666 the San Anton Chapel was finalized and received the blessing of the local Bishop Lucas Buenos; this is known by a letter sent to her by the bishop, dated on 10 July 1666. Eventually Cosmana had paid for the titular painting of the church in 1678, followed by the church patio (or courtyard) a year later in 1679. Cosmana had written to Grandmaster Nicolas Cotoner in order to sell her a nearby land next to the parish church, of which acquisition could extend and ameliorate the church and surrounding, but at her disappointment this was initially denied. Historically there was always a conflict between the Order of St. John and Roman Catholic priests in Malta in which case this also included issues related to St. Paul's Cave (Grotto). In 1680 Grand Master Gregorio Carafa conceded to give the property next to the church to Cosmana, allowing her to build the Chapel of St. Stephen as part of the parish church's side chapels, on condition of having his portrait at the church. Sometimes later she even added the Chapel of St. Publius to the parish church. In 1683 Cosmana paid for the construction of an underground for St. Paul's Grotto, and for the new baroque facade of the parish church seen just outside her house.|$|E

While a wide range of forecasting models is available for tourism demand forecasting, tourism managers should use models that are based on solid economic theories and provide reliable forecasts. In addition, this chapter suggests that in addition to forecasting error magnitude, directional change errors and turning point forecasting should be studied. Moreover, since no single model consistently generates superior forecasts across all situations, combining the forecasts generated from different forecasting methods improves tourism demand forecasting accuracy.
