25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word {{and brought her}} home as my wife, even though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E
500|$|In her 2014 biography, Valerie Solanas, Breanne Fahs {{argues that}} it is {{unlikely}} that Solanas appeared at the Chelsea Hotel looking for Girodias. Fahs states that Girodias may have fabricated the account in order to boost sales of the SCUM Manifesto, which he had published. Fahs states that [...] "the more likely story ... places Valerie at the Actor's Studio at 432 West Forty-Fourth Street early that morning." [...] Actress Sylvia Miles states that Solanas appeared at the Actor's Studio looking for Lee Strasberg, asking to leave her play for him. Miles said that Solanas [...] "had a different look, a bit tousled, like somebody whose appearance is the last thing on her mind." [...] Miles told Solanas that Strasberg would not be in until the afternoon. Miles said that she accepted a copy of the play from Solanas and then [...] "... shut the door because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> trouble.

[...] Producer Michael Filerman (Knots Landing and Falcon Crest) offered insight, [...] "Principal really wanted that role...and worked very hard to get it. And there's a humanity about her that's just winning. And the camera likes her very much. The camera just loves her. That's real important." [...] During the pilot filming, Principal became very close with teenaged actress Charlene Tilton, who played Lucy Ewing. Principal explained that [...] "the location shooting was hard on Tilton, who was only seventeen and had never been away from home".|$|E

2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{letters from}} Violet Keppel from Paris assuring her she only had feelings for her, Sackville-West had almost fainted {{when she read}} an announcement in a newspaper of Violet's engagement to Major Denys Trefusis. Sackville-West's response was to travel to Paris to see Keppel, taking her to the Hotel Roosevelt where she wrote in her diary: [...] "I treated savagely, I made love to her, I had her, I didn't care, I only wanted to hurt Denys". Keppel had used the engagement {{as a way of}} eliciting the response from Sackville-West she had wanted, and the next day Major Trefusis [...] "almost turned white" [...] when he discovered his fiancee and Sackville-West together in bed, a discovery that came as a great shock as he believed the two were just friends, and had apparently believed that women were incapable of falling in love with one another. That night, Sackville-West had dinner alone at the Ritz while Keppel watched her lovingly from the window in her room at an adjoining hotel while Denys Trefusis laid on the bed crying. Under strong pressure from her mother Alice Keppel, a deeply depressed and suicidal Keppel did marry Major Trefusis, though she made it clear that she did not love him. Sackville-West called the marriage her greatest failure as she made a plan for Keppel to escape with her to avoid marrying Trefusis, but was too cowardly to carry it out, later writing [...] "I sat quite dazed in my room holding my watch in my hand and watching the hands tick past the hour of Violet's wedding.

2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E
