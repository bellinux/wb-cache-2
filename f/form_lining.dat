2500|$|A {{proof-of-concept}} {{of using}} induced {{pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) to generate human organ for transplantation was reported by researchers from Japan. [...] Human ‘liver buds’ (iPSC-LBs) were grown from a mixture of three different kinds of stem cells: hepatocytes (for liver function) coaxed from iPSCs; endothelial stem cells (to <b>form</b> <b>lining</b> of blood vessels) from umbilical cord blood; and mesenchymal stem cells (to form connective tissue). This new approach allows different cell types to self-organize into a complex organ, mimicking the process in fetal development. [...] After growing in vitro for a few days, the liver buds were transplanted into mice where the ‘liver’ quickly connected with the host blood vessels and continued to grow. [...] Most importantly, it performed regular liver functions including metabolizing drugs and producing liver-specific proteins. [...] Further studies will monitor the longevity of the transplanted organ in the host body (ability to integrate or avoid rejection) and whether it will transform into tumors. [...] Using this method, cells from one mouse could be used to test 1,000 drug compounds to treat liver disease, and reduce animal use by up to 50,000.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a study on the energy transfer efficiency from a Blumlein pulse <b>forming</b> <b>line</b> to a load (resistive load and an ion diode with self-magnetic insulation) and a short-circuit mode. The experiments were carried out with the TEMP- 4 M ion accelerator, which consist of a capacitive storage -Marx generator, a water Blumlein pulse <b>forming</b> <b>line</b> and a diode with self magnetic insulation. We have found that the energy loss is due to current leakage in the Blumline line during its charging. The energy loss observed is due to resistance of water which is used as a dielectric medium in pulse <b>forming</b> <b>line.</b> However, the main source of energy loss occurs in spark gaps and amounts to be 9 - 10 %...|$|R

50|$|Roll <b>forming</b> <b>lines</b> {{can be set}} up with {{multiple}} configurations to punch and cut off parts in a continuous operation. For cutting a part to length, the lines {{can be set up}} to use a pre-cut die where a single blank runs through the roll mill, or a post-cut die where the profile is cutoff after the roll forming process. Features may be added in a hole, notch, embossment, or shear form by punching in a roll <b>forming</b> <b>line.</b> These part features can be done in a pre-punch application (before roll forming starts), in a mid-line punching application (in the middle of a roll forming line/process) or a post punching application (after roll forming is done). Some roll <b>forming</b> <b>lines</b> incorporate only one of the above punch or cutoff applications, others incorporate {{some or all of the}} applications in one line.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ti and Au foils with a {{thickness}} of 10 µm were formed by indenting {{at a place}} neighboring another indented place sequentially {{by means of a}} hemispherical diamond tool with a radius of 5 µm. In this forming method, forming dies are not necessary and commercial equipments for nanoindentation can be used. Forming load and pitch were changed in single <b>line</b> <b>forming</b> and <b>forming</b> direction, <b>line</b> pitch and line number were changed in plural <b>line</b> <b>forming,</b> and bending angle was investigated. From the experimental results, bending angle of Ti foil was greater than that of Au one when same working conditions were employed. As the forming pitch increased, bending angle decreased. When the <b>forming</b> <b>line</b> pitch was changed, bending angle had the maximum peak at a pitch of 30 µm by one-way forming path and 25 µm by two-way forming path. Bending angle by one-way forming path was larger than that by two-way forming path.
