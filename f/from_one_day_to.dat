5|$|No.285 Squadron {{generally}} holds two {{pilot and}} navigator conversion courses per year. Each six-month course includes approximately 120 {{hours in the}} FFMS and 30 hours in flying aircraft. It culminates in an airborne operation module, which includes formation flying, airdrops, night landings with night-vision goggles, and simulated combat utilising the C-130's self-defence systems to prepare the aircrew for conditions in Middle East deployments. Following this exercise, the new C-130 aircrew are posted to No.37 Squadron. No.285 Squadron may run 30 or more courses each year for ground support staff; these courses can last <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> five weeks.|$|E
5|$|The failed {{expeditionary force}} led to open warfare between Tiku, {{who went into}} hiding in his {{fortress}} at Buntu Batu, and Dutch troops. Tiku kept spies on the Dutch forces at Rantepao. On 22 June they reported that the preceding night a Dutch battalion consisting of roughly 250 men and 500 porters had departed the village, headed south towards Tiku's fortress at Lali' Londong. Tiku ordered the road sabotaged, extending the travel time <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> five. On the night of 26 June, Tiku's forces attacked the Dutch forces outside of Lali' Londong, an attack for which the Dutch were unprepared; nobody {{was killed in the}} attack. The following morning, the Dutch began a siege on Lali' Londong, using hand grenades and ladders. Unable to deal with the grenades, which the Dutch had not used on the other lords, that afternoon the fortress was captured.|$|E

25|$|Colston Hall {{was popular}} for wrestling matches from 1951.

25|$|The Travelcard is an inter-modal travel {{ticket for}} {{unlimited}} {{use on the}} London Underground, London Overground, TfL Rail, Docklands Light Railway, Tramlink, London Buses and National Rail services in the Greater London area. Travelcards can be purchased {{for a period of}} time varying <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> a year, from Transport for London, National Rail and their agents. Depending on where it is purchased, and the length of validity, a Travelcard is either printed on a paper ticket with a magnetic stripe or encoded onto an Oyster card, Transport for London's contactless electronic smart card. The cost of a Travelcard is determined by the area it covers and, for this purpose, London is divided into a number of fare zones. The Travelcard season ticket for unlimited travel on London Buses and the London Underground was launched on 22 May 1983 by London Transport. One Day Travelcards and validity on other transport modes were added from 1984 onwards. The introduction of the Travelcard caused an increase in patronage and reduced the number of tickets that needed to be purchased by passengers.|$|E

500|$|Throughout early 1944, the {{battalion}} was mainly involved in patrol operations {{in support of}} the 21st Brigade's advance up the Faria River to capture the Japanese positions around on the Kankiryo Saddle during the Battle of Shaggy Ridge. As a part of this effort, {{the battalion}}'s most significant engagement came on 11 October 1943 when 9 Platoon, under Lieutenant Noel Pallier, destroyed a Japanese company in capturing a ridge that overlooked the valley. The Japanese company had been threatening to cut off the supply line of the 2/27th Battalion, which was leading the 21st Brigade's advance and the following day, heavy fighting took place around John's Knoll and Trevor's Ridge. After this, the battalion undertook mainly patrol actions in the following weeks, these actions varied in size from small groups to company-sized forces, and varied in length <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> up to a week. In late November, the battalion relieve the 2/25th Battalion around John's Knoll, marching [...] From there, they occupied an outpost position opposite a strong Japanese position, against which they clashed several times throughout December until being withdrawn to the rear around the Lakes area in late December, and then Port Moresby in early January 1944. Although there were only limited engagements with the Japanese during the four months that the 2/14th were involved in the campaign, the battalion still suffered heavily with 958 men being evacuated due to illness or accidental injury during this time. Of these, four died and a further 546 were permanently removed from the theatre. In contrast, battle casualties during this time amounted to seven killed in action, three died of wounds and 25 wounded.|$|E
