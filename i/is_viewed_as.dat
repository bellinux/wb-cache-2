5|$|The Treaty of Devol <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{a typical}} {{example of the}} Byzantine {{tendency}} to settle disputes through diplomacy rather than warfare, and was both a result of and a cause for the distrust between the Byzantines and their Western European neighbors.|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} with virtual particles also explains the small (about 0.1%) deviation of the intrinsic magnetic {{moment of the}} electron from the Bohr magneton (the anomalous magnetic moment). The extraordinarily precise agreement of this predicted difference with the experimentally determined value <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the great}} achievements of quantum electrodynamics.|$|E

5|$|Cameroon <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{rife with}} {{corruption}} {{at all levels}} of government. In 1997, Cameroon established anti-corruption bureaus in 29 ministries, but only 25% became operational, and in 2012, Transparency International placed Cameroon at number 144 on a list of 176 countries ranked from least to most corrupt. On 18 January 2006, Biya initiated an anti-corruption drive {{under the direction of the}} National Anti-Corruption Observatory. There are several high corruption risk areas in Cameroon, for instance, customs, public health sector and public procurement.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Russos' studies found similar risk rates between virgin and {{pregnancy}} interrupted rats, their research would be used to support the contention that abortion created a greater risk of breast cancer for the next twenty years. However, because rats do not exhibit naturally occurring breast cancer, the extrapolation of these results to human abortion and breast cancer <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> dubious.|$|E

5|$|In Christian theology, {{the work}} of the Holy Spirit under the Old Covenant <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> less {{extensive}} than that under the New Covenant inaugurated on the day of Pentecost. The Spirit was restricted to certain chosen individuals, such as high priests and prophets. Often termed the “spirit of prophecy” in rabbinic writings, the Holy Spirit was closely associated with prophecy and divine inspiration. It was anticipated that in the future messianic age God would pour out his spirit upon all of Israel, which would become a nation of prophets.|$|E
5|$|In {{everyday}} life, {{there are}} three familiar dimensions of space: height, width and depth. Einstein's {{general theory of relativity}} treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general relativity, space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four-dimensional spacetime, three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this framework, the phenomenon of gravity <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a consequence of the geometry of spacetime.|$|E

5|$|Sodium {{compounds}} are {{of immense}} commercial importance, being particularly central to industries producing glass, paper, soap, and textiles. The most important sodium compounds are table salt (NaCl), soda ash (Na2CO3), baking soda (NaHCO3), caustic soda (NaOH), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), di- and tri-sodium phosphates, sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3·5H2O), and borax (Na2B4O7·10H2O). In compounds, sodium is usually ionically bonded to water and anions, and <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a hard Lewis acid.|$|E

During this time she lost her virginity to Hartono, an act which <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{unacceptable}} in traditional Indonesian culture; when Hartono left her, Tini became increasingly aloof and distant from men. After marrying Tono, she felt increasingly lonely and became involved in social work {{as an effort to}} give her life meaning. After learning of Tono's infidelity and seeing that Yah could take better care of him, Tini leaves her husband and moves to Surabaya.|$|E
5|$|Team {{cohesion}} <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> ‘‘a general {{indicator of}} synergistic group interaction—or process’’. Furthermore, cohesion {{has been linked}} to greater coordination during team-tasks as well as improved satisfaction, productivity, and group interactions.

However, the Greek learns about this through his mole inside the FBI and has Sobotka killed. The {{investigation}} ends with the fourteen homicides solved but the perpetrator already dead. Several drug dealers and mid-level smuggling figures tied to the Greek are arrested, but he and his second-in-command escape uncharged and unidentified.

5|$|Eliot {{started writing}} East Coker in 1939, and {{modelled}} the poem after Burnt Norton {{as a way}} to focus his thoughts. The poem served as a sort of opposite to the popular idea that The Waste Land served as an expression of disillusionment after World War I, though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. The poem focuses on life, death, and continuity between the two. Humans are seen as disorderly and science <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> unable to save mankind from its flaws. Instead, science and reason lead mankind to warfare, and humanity needs to become humble in order to escape the cycle of destruction. To be saved, people must recognize Christ as their savior as well as their need for redemption.|$|E
5|$|HeliumII is a superfluid, {{a quantum}} {{mechanical}} state (see: macroscopic quantum phenomena) of matter with strange properties. For example, when it flows through capillaries {{as thin as}} 10−7 to 10−8m it has no measurable viscosity. However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity {{comparable to that of}} gaseous helium was observed. Current theory explains this using the two-fluid model for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state, which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.|$|E
