50|$|A patient sits comfortably {{with the}} {{treatment}} leg elevated. A fine needle electrode is {{inserted into the}} lower, inner aspect of the leg, slightly cephalad/rostral to the medial malleolus. As {{the goal is to}} send stimulation through the tibial nerve, {{it is important to have}} the needle electrode near (but not on) the tibial nerve. A surface electrode (<b>grounding</b> <b>pad)</b> is placed over the medial aspect of the calcaneus on the same leg. The needle electrode is then connected to an external pulse generator which delivers an adjustable electrical pulse that travels to the sacral plexus via the tibial nerve. Among other functions, the sacral nerve plexus regulates bladder and pelvic floor function.|$|E
50|$|Burns from {{electrocautery}} generally {{arise from}} a faulty <b>grounding</b> <b>pad</b> or from {{an outbreak of}} a fire. Monopolar electrocautery works because radio frequency energy is concentrated by the surgical instrument's small surface area. The electrical circuit is completed by passing current through the patient's body to a conductive pad that is connectd to the radio frequency generator. Because the pad's surface area is large relative to the instrument's tip, energy density across the pad is reliably low enough that no tissue injury occurs at the pad site. Electrical shocks and burns are possible, however, if the circuit is interrupted or energy is concentrated in some way. This can happen if the pad surface in contact is small, e.g. if the pad's electrolytic gel is dry, if the pad becomes disconnected from the radio frequency generator, or via a metal implant. Modern electrocautery systems are equipped with sensors to detect high resistance in the circuit that can prevent some injuries.|$|E

40|$|Journal {{compilation}} © 2008 Royal Australasian College of SurgeonsBackground: Bimodal electric tissue ablation {{is a novel}} variation {{to standard}} radiofrequency ablation that produces significantly larger ablations {{by the addition of}} a direct electrical current. The negative electrode is attached to the radiofrequency current and the positive electrode is placed nearby. It has been identified that an electrolytic injury can occur at the positive electrode site. It is suggested that by increasing the surface area that is in contact with the positive electrode, the risk of tissue injury is reduced. This hypothesis was tested in a pig model. Methods: Thirty-six ablations were carried out in the livers of six pigs (six ablations per pig). Two were standard radiofrequency ablation controls and two were carried out with positive electrode attached to a scalpel blade. Two were carried out with positive electrode attached to a <b>grounding</b> <b>pad.</b> After 48 h, liver was harvested and the ablation sizes were compared. Skin biopsies were taken from the scalpel site and one from the pad site and examined histopathologically. Results: The scalpel blade ablations were significantly larger than controls and the <b>grounding</b> <b>pad</b> ablations (P < 0. 001). The <b>grounding</b> <b>pad</b> ablation was significantly larger than controls. The scalpel blade skin site showed full-thickness tissue injury.

We sought to determine the benefit of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in providing pain relief for patients with refractory pain secondary to metastases involving bone. Patients and Methods Thirty-one US and 12 European patients with painful osteolytic metastases involving bone were treated with image-guided RFA using a multitip needle. Treated patients had 4 / 10 pain and had either failed or were poor candidates for standard treatments such as radiation or opioid analgesics. Using the Brief Pain Inventory–Short Form, worst pain intensity was the primary end point, with a 2 -unit drop considered clinically significant. Results Forty-three patients were treated (median follow-up, 16 weeks). Before RFA, {{the mean score for}} worst pain was 7. 9 (range, 4 / 10 to 10 / 10). Four, 12, and 24 weeks following treatment, worst pain decreasedto 4. 5 (P 0001), 3. 0 (P 0001), and 1. 4 (ìP. 0005), respectively. Ninety-five percent (41 of 43 patients) experienced a decrease in pain that was considered clinically significant. Opioid usage significantly decreased at weeks 8 and 12.

40|$|Background: Surgical care is an {{essential}} component of health care of children worldwide. Incidences of congenital anomalies, trauma, cancers and acquired diseases continue to rise and along with that the impact of surgical intervention on public health system also increases. It then becomes essential that the surgical teams make the procedures safe and error proof. The World Health Organization (WHO) has instituted the surgical checklist as a global initiative to improve surgical safety. Aims: To assess the acceptance, application and adherence to the WHO Safe Surgery Checklist in Pediatric Surgery Practice at a university teaching hospital. Materials and Methods: In a prospective study, spanning 2 years, the checklist was implemented for all patients who underwent operative procedures under general anesthesia. The checklist identified three phases of an operation, each corresponding to a specific period in the normal flow of work: Before the induction of anesthesia ("sign in"), before the skin incision ("time out") and before the patient leaves the operating room ("sign out"). In each phase, an anesthesiologist,-"checklist coordinator," confirmed that the anesthesia, surgery and nursing teams have completed the listed tasks before proceeding with the operation and exit. The checklist was used for 3000 consecutive patients. Results: No major perioperative errors were noted. In 54 (1. 8 %) patients, children had the same names and identical surgical procedure posted on the same operation list. The patient identification tag was missing in four (0. 1 %) patients. Mention of the side of procedures was missing in 108 (3. 6 %) cases. In 0. 1 % (3) of patients there was mix up of the mention of side of operation in the case papers and consent forms. In 78 (2. 6 %) patients, the consent form was not signed by parents/guardians or the side of the procedure was not quoted. Antibiotic orders were missing in five (0. 2 %) patients. In 12 (0. 4 %) cases, immobilization of the patients was suboptimal, which led to displacement of diathermy <b>grounding</b> <b>pad.</b> In 54 (1. 8 %) patients, the checklist was not used at all.

40|$|The driving {{actions of}} rainfall-runoff {{process can be}} {{attributed}} to two aspects. The first is the influence of precipitation process, and the second is that of the <b>ground</b> <b>pad.</b> The research results of 179 indoor experiments conducted to imitate rainfall-runoff process indicate that both precipitation duration and intensity play important roles in affecting confluence lag time, which is obviously inconsistent with the traditional hypotheses. The nonlinear relationship is of great significance to the confluence curve especially when the precipitation duration is less than the total confluence time or the precipitation intensity is small. Therefore it can be concluded that the unit hydrograph (UH) can be applied to rainfall-runoff process imitation in the humid areas in the south China region. However, the UH application should be strictly modified in accordance with precipitation conditions in the arid and semiarid region of north China where the precipitation duration is short and the intensity is unstable. It will be hard to get ideal imitation results if the UH is applied blindly without considering specific conditions in the north China region. This also explains the unsatisfactory imitation results caused by using various hydrological models in the north China region. When the precipitation duration is short, and the watershed has not reached total watershed concentration, the characteristics of confluence change greatly, which reflects the actual situation in the north China region. Therefore necessary nonlinear corrections should be made when UH is applied. If the duration is longer than the total confluence time and the balance between pondage and discharge is stricken, the imitation research results will be applicable to both rainfall-runoff relation with longer duration in the south China region and the basic theoretical research on runoff generation and concentration. On conditions of adequate rainfall, peak discharge is in linear relationship with intensity, but {{has nothing to do with}} the <b>ground</b> <b>pad.</b> There is a negative linear relationship between intensity and time to peak. The amount of pondage capacity in a catchment is in linear relationship with intensity and peak discharge, with obvious influence by the <b>ground</b> <b>pad</b> status and interception, and it has nothing to do with the position of interceptions.

Compared with monopolar-radiofrequency ablation (M-RFA), B-RFA does not require <b>grounding</b> <b>pads,</b> thereby avoiding dermal burn injuries, and does not position probes directly into the tumour but rather on the perimeter. Additionally, B-RFA can precoagulate parenchyma to assist in hepatic resection. Herein, we report our early experience using B-RFA. MethodsA retrospective review identified 68 patients who underwent M-RFA or B-RFA between June 2004 and September 2010 in an academic centre. Peri-operative metrics were analysed. ResultsM-RFA was used to treat 30 patients, whereas B-RFA was used for 17 patients. There were no differences in peri-operative metrics, survival or disease recurrence between M-RFA and B-RFA. Seventeen additional patients underwent B-RFA precoagulation during laparoscopic resection (segmentectomy in eleven patients and multi-segmental resection in six patients). Four patients with multifocal disease underwent procedures that combined B-RFA with resection.

We have conducted experiments with a pork liver and an RF ablation apparatus capable of measuring and recording some of the procedure parameters. Those include the applied power, the effective electrical impedance, and the temperature around the tip of the probe. A history of the values at each second of the test is obtained at the end. Our aim is to adjust the material properties and other model param-eters for the simulation to fit the experimentally obtained results. The electrical conductivity of the tissue can be deduced from the measured power and impedance. After that, we need to determine suitable heat conductivity and capacity coefficients. This is achieved via temperature curves comparison. ...|$|R
