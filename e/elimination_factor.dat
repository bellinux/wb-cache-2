40|$|The {{mechanism}} of maternal mitochondrial inheritance in animals involves the selective elimination of sperm mitochondria by the <b>elimination</b> <b>factor</b> {{of the egg}} and the sperm mitochondria-specific factor. In vitro fertilization using sperm from isogenic mice incorporating heterospecific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) showed {{that the number of}} PCR positives of sperm mtDNA in two-cell embryos was significantly increased following sperm incubation with anti-tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein involved in spermatogenesis (tpis) protein, anti-translocator of mitochondrial outer membrane (Tom) 22 and anti-Tom 40 antibodies. The treatment of fertilized eggs with EGTA and other endonuclease inhibitors increased the sperm mtDNA levels. We conclude that the <b>elimination</b> <b>factor,</b> which is probably an endonuclease, is selectively received by the tpis protein of the sperm mitochondrial outer membrane within the egg. It is then transported into the sperm mitochondria by Tom 22 and Tom 40, where it destroys the sperm mtDNA, establishing the maternal inheritance of mtDNA.

40|$|Gastrin {{secretion}} was {{studied in}} vitro and in vivo {{in response to}} pharmacological agents and chemicals, as well as abomasal parasites and microbial products. The causes and effects of hypergastrinaemia, along with bacterial numbers {{and the presence of}} a gastrin secretion inhibitor in the abomasal contents of sheep infected with Ostertagia circumcincta were studied. The pharmacology of the gastrin secretion from the unparasitised antrum was shown to be similar to that in monogastric animals. In vitro gastrin secretion by ovine antral segments was stimulated by Gastrin Releasing Peptide, carbachol and nicotine, but not adrenaline. Basal gastrin release was unaffected by somatostatin or Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide, but these reduced the gastrin response to stimulants. Gastrin secretion was also stimulated by amino acids, ammonia and acetate. Hypergastrinaemia during O. circumcincta infection did not correlate well with decreased food intake or appear to affect parietal cell recovery. Serum gastrin concentrations correlated well with abomasal pH following adult O. circumcincta transplant, but poorly after larval infections. This suggests that other factors, such as inflammation and tissue damage, also affect gastrin secretion during abomasal parasitism. Anaerobic bacterial numbers in abomasal contents increased to near rumen levels when abomasal pH was 3. 5 and above, but this did not affect serum gastrin concentrations. An inhibitor of in vitro gastrin secretion also started to appear in abomasal contents of pH 3. 5 and over, but did not have significant effects on in vitro gastrin secretion unless contents were pH 4. 5 and over. However, gastrin inhibitory activity in abomasal contents and serum gastrin levels were positively correlated, suggesting abomasal gastrin inhibitory activity has little effect on gastrin secretion in vivo. Three competing factors were present in rumen fluid and rumen incubates: an inhibitor and a stimulant of secretion and an <b>elimination</b> <b>factor.</b> The stimulant was resistant to acid degradation, had a molecular weight below 3000 Mr and was hydrophilic.

Bacillus stearothermophilus spores suspended in faeces were used as indicators because of their non-sensitivity to the hot-water temperature. Their elimination by flushing could thus be attributed to the mechanical effect of the water and not to the disinfecting effect of the temperature. A simple bacteriological technique was used, and the <b>elimination</b> <b>factor</b> (EF) was calculated as the ratio of the number of micro-organisms in the contamination before and after flushing. By using flushing water below 50 degrees C for 130 s the EF on a bedpan was about 10 (4) - 10 (6). The effect of flushing with water of the same temperature for only half that time was somewhat weaker and when the temperature was raised to 85 degrees C after half the flushing time the effect was somewhat stronger. It can be presumed that the conventional disinfecting phase with hot (85 degrees C) water for about 45 s in the commonly used flushing units could be substantially shortened and the costs of their use thereby reduced...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of maternal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) inheritance in animals {{can be said}} to be the selective elimination of sperm mtDNA via the <b>elimination</b> <b>factor</b> of the egg and a sperm mitochondria-specific factor. In 2005, we clarified that t-tpis (Spag 1 isoform 1) is a mitochondria-specific translocator and the sperm factor, and furthermore estimated that the elimination factors of the egg are the divalent cation-dependent endonuclease and s-tpis (Spag 1 isoform 2 and isoform 3) as the elimination system-specific chaperone [K. Hayashida, K. Omagari, J. Masuda, H. Hazama, Y. Kadokawa, K. Ohba, S. Kohno, The sperm mitochondria-specific translocator has a key role in maternal mitochondrial inheritance, Cell Biol. Int. 29 (2005) 472 - 481]. This time, using a recombinant Spag 1 isoform 1 protein, a pull-down assay of ovary cytosol was performed and the elimination factors searched for. Surprisingly, an endogenous retroviral integrase fragment (Eri 15) was identified using mass spectrometry of the electrophoresis band of the pull-down protein. Eri 15 was detected as a complex of approximately 500 kDa with Spag 1 isoform 2 or isoform 3 in native PAGE of the ovary cytosol. This strongly suggested that Eri 15 is selectively transported into the sperm mitochondria matrix by Spag 1 isoform 2 and 3 via Spag 1 isoform 1 and that sperm mtDNA is destroyed, thus causing the establishment of maternal mtDNA inheritance...|$|E

The experiments were carried out in perfectly mixed contactors at controlled illumination, using mosses picked out in February 1997, with a background initial zinc concentration of 263 mg g 1 (dry wt.). A first-order mass transfer kinetic model was fitted to the experimental data to determine the uptake and release constants, k 1 and k 2; the zinc concentration in mosses {{at the end of}} the uptake period, Cmu; and at the equilibrium, for the contamination and decontamination stages, Cme and Cmr; respectively. A bioconcentration factor, BCF k 1 =k 2 (zinc concentration in the plant, dry wt. /zinc concentration in the water) was determined. A biological <b>elimination</b> <b>factor</b> defined as BEF 1 Cmr=Cmu was also calculated. BCF decreases from about 4500 to 2950 as Zn concentration in water increases from 1. 05 to 3. 80 mg l 1. BEF is approximately constant and equal to 0. 80. Comparing Zn and Cu accumulation by Fontinalis antipyretica, it was concluded that the uptake rate for Zn (145 h 1) is much lower than for Cu (628 h 1) and the amount retained by the plant decreased by a factor of about seven. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Cette étude en {{laboratoire}} traite de l'accumulation et de l'élimination du Cd réalisées par deux mousses aquatiques indigènes du Québec, Fontinalis dalecarlica et Platyhypnidium riparioides. Les expositions au Cd étaient de 0 (témoin), 0, 8, 2 et 10 µg·L- 1, concentrations retrouvées en milieu naturel (non contaminé) et contaminé. Les expériences ont été réalisées à trois niveaux de dureté de l'eau (10 à 15, 40 à 50, 80 à 100 mg·L- 1 de CaCO 3), à alcalinité constante (80 à 100 mg·L- 1 de CaCO 3) et à pH stable (7, 30) durant une période de 28 jours. Les facteurs d'augmentation des concentrations (FAC) ont démontré une diminution de l'accumulation totale de Cd dans les mousses dans 75 % des cas lorsque la dureté de l'eau passe de très douce à dure. Les facteurs de contamination résiduelle (FCR) démontrent la lenteur de l'élimination du Cd par les mousses, et ce, indépendamment de la dureté de l'eau ou de la contamination préalablement subie. Deux équations de régression multiple par étape (Stepwise) ont été établies pour expliquer les facteurs influençant l'accumulation et l'élimination de Cd réalisées par les mousses. Les variables indépendantes incluses dans les équations linéaires de prédiction pour l'accumulation et l'élimination étaient la concentration de Cd dans l'eau, {{le temps}} d'exposition, la dureté de l'eau, l'espèce de mousses utilisée et/ou les interactions de ces variables. Les équations linéaires de prédiction pour l'accumulation et l'élimination ont permis d'expliquer respectivement 92 % et 71 % de la variance observée. Cette identification des principaux facteurs influençant l'accumulation et l'élimination du Cd dans les mousses est d'une grande importance pour la compréhension des processus complexes dirigeant l'absortion des métaux lourds par des organismes vivants. Les équations permettent également de mieux expliquer les interactions engendrées par la variation de divers paramètres sur l'accumulation et l'élimination du Cd par les mousses aquatiques. Aquatic mosses {{have played a}} large part {{in the assessment of}} toxic elements in water. The advantage of mosses over direct water sampling is that the use of the former lessens spatial and temporal variations, enhances the level of contaminant identification by concentrating toxic elements, and provides information relative to the bioavailable portion. However, the concentration of metals that can be measured in mosses is not a reliable indicator of the concentration of toxic elements in the water, which is why we need to model the bioaccumulation phenomenon. The present laboratory study deals with the accumulation and elimination of Cd by two indigenous Quebec aquatic mosses: Fontinalis dalecarlica and Platyhypnidium riparioides. The previously acclimatized mosses were treated with different concentrations of Cd, three different levels of water hardness, a constant alkalinity and constant pH level for a period of 28 days, in order to establish their bioaccumulative capacity. Cd exposure concentrations were 0 (control), 0. 8, 2 and 10 mg·L- 1, with a replication at 10 mg·L- 1. The experiments were carried out at three levels of water hardness (10 to 15, 40 to 50, 80 to 100 mg·L- 1 of CaCO 3), with a constant degree of alkalinity (80 to 100 mg·L- 1 of CaCO 3) and stable pH (7. 30). The mosses subsequently went through an elimination period (Cd-free water) of 28 days. The triplicate moss samples were mineralized using nitric acid and all Cd measurements were made by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The results indicate that the water chemistry conditions remained stable and were properly controlled. The aquatic mosses demonstrated a considerable ability to absorb and adsorb Cd: the measured Cd water concentrations were less than the nominal concentrations. Nonetheless, moss uptake of Cd improves with an increase in Cd contamination and the concentration factors (CF) range from 6 to 122. For the same exposure concentration, the CF drops in some 63 % of those instances where water hardness rises from very soft, through soft, to hard. In 75 % of the cases there is a drop in CF when water hardness increases directly from very soft to hard. With a stable concentration (e. g. 2 mg·L- 1), F. dalecarlica has respective CFs of 26. 3, 22. 2 and 18, which demonstrates the negative gradation of Cd accumulation as water hardness increases. The residual contamination factors (RCF) bear witness to the slow rate of Cd elimination by the mosses, irrespective of the level of water hardness or of any previous contamination. The <b>elimination</b> <b>factor</b> for RCF is never greater than 2. Mosses take up metals faster than they can eliminate them and have a memory of past contaminations, which is an advantage when it comes to studying ad hoc and/or sporadic contamination phenomena. Two stepwise multiple regression equations have been set up to explain the factors that impact on accumulation and elimination of Cd by mosses. The variables included in the equations were: level of Cd concentration in the water; exposure time; water hardness; the moss species involved, and/or the interactions between these variables. The predictive linear equations for the accumulation and elimination provided explanations for 92 % and 71 % respectively of the observed variances. The predictive linear equation for accumulation establishes that the length of exposure is the principal parameter responsible for the uptake of Cd by the aquatic mosses. It shows that the accumulation of Cd by the mosses is initially influenced by the level of Cd concentration in the water, but also depends on the length of time over which the bryophytes are exposed to this concentration. Thus, the higher the Cd concentration, the shorter the exposure time for the moss contamination, and vice versa. The second variable is the effect of water hardness taken together with the exposure time. This is a negative variable: the greater the increase in water hardness, the greater the exposure time required to obtain the same degree of moss contamination. This is indicative of the impact of Ca++ and Mg++ on moss uptake. The impact of water hardness is probably the consequence of the availability of or preference of plant-binding sites for Ca++ and Mg++ ions, thus reducing the number of available locations for Cd accumulation. Water hardness and Cd concentration levels are the third variable in this equation and are probably linked to the effect of water hardness on the bioavailability of Cd for the mosses. This variable may also explain why the increase in Cd concentration levels in the water lessens the impact of water hardness on the total accumulation of Cd in the mosses. Finally, the equation identifies a greater level of accumulation in the P. riparoides. Release linear regression shows that the absence of Cd in the water is the major parameter in the elimination of Cd by aquatic mosses. We should remember that the bryophytes are seeking to achieve a steady state condition with their environment, since the Cd is an element that is neither regulated or essential. Its elimination {{has little to do with}} water hardness, but is caused by the inversion of a diffusion gradient when the environment is no longer Cd contaminated. During the elimination process, the Ca++ and Mg++ ions have no real impact on the release of Cd by the mosses. The length of prior exposure does affect elimination: the greater it is, the longer the release period required for moss decontamination. Exposure time is less important during elimination than during accumulation. Elimination is a very slow process, and a longer study would probably have shown that this is a major factor in the elimination of moss-accumulated Cd. The present identification of the major factors impacting on the accumulation and elimination of Cd in mosses is extremely important if we are to understand the complex processes that determine the absorption of heavy metals by living organisms. The equations also allow us to better explain the interactions caused by variations in the different parameters with respect to the accumulation and elimination of Cd by aquatic mosses...|$|E

The percentage of left-handers in a population decreases with age, which can be the result of either modification or <b>elimination</b> <b>factors.</b> In the literature there are contradictory results as to which theory can best explain this phenomenon.

According to the Tanzanian Cancer Registry, which records all histologically confirmed malignant tumors, the number of reported cancer cases has increased significantly over the past three decades. The most commonly diagnosed tumors are cervix cancer, skin cancer, primary liver cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, and Burkitt's lymphoma. Geographical and tribal variations exist in disease frequency.

Our results show that most cases of liver cancer can be {{prevented}} through vaccination, antiviral treatment, safe blood transfusion and injection practices, as well as interventions to reduce excessive alcohol use.

The most common type of surgery performed today for Reinke's edema is called surgical microlaryngoscopy. Most procedures follow the microflap technique set in place by Hirano. During surgery, an incision is made into the vocal cord using either microscissors or a CO2 laser. A flap of mucosa is lifted and the affected tissue is removed using suction or a microdebrider. The flap is then re-draped and trimmed to the appropriate size.|$|R
