[...] Anne Longfield, Children's Commissioner for England wrote [...] "The majority of children living in poverty have at least one parent who is working. Employment is important but if wages do not rise substantially in relation to living costs it will not provide a route out of poverty alone. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has today published a report stating that families with children working full-time on the National Minimum Wage are now 15% short of the Minimum Income Standard that people believe offers an acceptable standard of living.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years the {{incidence}} of relative poverty among Britain's children has tripled. These changes are related to increased earnings inequality, {{growth in the number}} of single (lone) parent households, and an increased share of households with children with no working adult. The Labour Government has responded by adopting as a policy objective ending child poverty by 2020. Initial steps toward this end include increasing direct financial support to families with children, creating financial incentives for work for parents, adopting more intensive case management for the welfare caseload, and ameliorating the long-term consequences of the deprivation poverty brings. The Working Families' Tax Credit (WFTC) is the centerpiece of the financial support innovations but there is a broader swathe of welfare reforms which has received less attention. Overall, the U. K. system provides more generous support to the lowest-income families than is available in the U. S., and recent reforms have directly reduced child poverty. For most households, the reforms have reduced marginal benefit deduction rates and increased incentives to work. Preliminary evidence suggests the changes have had greatest effect on single parents. Continued progress requires the adoption of a more specific procedure for defining and measuring child <b>poverty.</b> Welfare, inequality, <b>in-work</b> benefits, child <b>poverty...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{minimum wage}} was {{introduced}} in 1998 to combat the problem of <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> and inequality. The act established {{for the first time}} in the UK a minimum hourly rate of pay. In order, to guarantee that workers received the wage an enforcement structure was created using two methods. These were worker-led Industrial Tribunal claims and the minimum wage enforcement teams (Inland Revenue). Few workers have used the employment tribunals to recover money because many victims of breach of minimum wage are vulnerable, for example, ethnic minorities, youth, uneducated and non-unionsed workers. A more likely channel of action is the minimum wage enforcement teams, which are run by the Inland Revenue. These teams have a number of powers including power of entry into workplaces and seizure of employers' records. In order to enforce these regulations through a ‘pyramid of sanctions’, which include: enforcement order, penalty enforcement and prosecution under criminal law. The enforcement order requests the employer to repay the worker any underpayment. If the employer refuses to comply with this requirement, penalty enforcement is issued which orders the firm to not only repay the worker (s), but to also pay a substantial fine. However, if the employer still refuses payment, as a consequence they will face prosecution under criminal law. This action can, however be seen as ineffective as only two companies have ever been prosecuted for such offences. The low rates of enforcement action are demonstrated below.|$|E

40|$|<b>In-work</b> <b>poverty</b> {{challenges}} the conventional understanding and explanation of poverty. The concepts {{of work and}} poverty were {{for a long time}} seen by policy makers as having little in common. However, official <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> figures of the last decade reveal that employed people are not immune to poverty. What is more, incidents of <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> are neither unique nor isolated. The most recent statistical data show that nearly 9 per cent of employees in the European Union are facing risk of poverty. Consequently, this phenomenon is gradually becoming a most pressing issue that, until recently, had been largely ignored by both the scientific community and policy makers in Europe. This dissertation examines the extent and nature of <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> in Lithuania, a country that joined the EU in 2004. It aims to analyse the contextual determinants of <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> in the country, as well as expose factual and experiential dimensions of the phenomenon. This study uses mixed research methods consisting of two main inquiry strategies: a quantitative examination of <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> indicators and qualitative analysis of <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> experiences. It uses both primary and secondary data analysis by combining empirical data drawn from the Eurostat statistical database with data collected via qualitative semi-structured interviews. Even though the research was conducted {{in the aftermath of the}} financial crisis of 2007 - 08, a time when <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> rates in Lithuania escalated to unprecedented levels, the findings are contextualized as they represent an outcome of long-term structural arrangements and prevalent ideological discourse. The findings of this study challenge the dominant idea that creation of jobs and integration into the labour market can be considered a sustainable anti-poverty policy. It reveals that predictors of <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> in Lithuania are primarily ingrained within the very structures that are often seen as safeguards against poverty in capitalist countries, namely, the labour market and welfare state...|$|E

40|$|AbstractEmpirical {{research}} shows that working poverty (or <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty)</b> has become a serious socio-economic problem at European level, and not only.

The results highlight that working poverty din Romania, ismainly determinedby employment vulnerability and precarity. The existence of an inefficient employment structure, characterised by high employment in agriculture, high share of self-employment (especially own-account workers and contributing family workers), low labour productivity, low level of the employed population with tertiary education, contributes to an increase in employment vulnerability in Romania, with a negative impact on working poverty.

40|$|Excerpt] The {{working poor}} are a {{substantial}} {{group in the}} overall poverty statistics and are estimated to constitute 10 % of European workers. This report examines <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> in the European Union, picking up where a previous Eurofound report on this subject, published in 2010, ended. It looks at how <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> evolved {{in the aftermath of}} the financial crisis of 2008, based on analysis of the latest data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). While the prevalence of <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> has been studied before, less is known about what it means to be one of the working poor. This report examines the social ramifications of <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> by describing the well-being and living conditions of the working poor.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{determinants}} of working poverty in the European Union. At the individual and household level, the factors contributing to working poverty differ in importance across countries. Nonetheless, being a lone parent, having low education, having a temporary contract, working part-time or less than full-year, {{appear to be the}} most important risk factors. Low pay, under-employment and family structures combine to explain working poverty. At the national level, the correlation between poverty and <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> is strong: countries with low levels of <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> are also the ones which keep overall poverty low. At this level there does not appear to be a dilemma between fighting <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> and overall poverty. The strongest determinant contribution to low <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> is high social spending as a proportion of GDP. The level of spending is more important than the way the spending is done or financed: both the social democratic and the social assurance regimes have good performances in terms of <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty.</b> Women’s employment rate, which is generally viewed as being a factor in keeping <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> low, is no more significant when level of social spending is taken into account. This underlines the ambiguous effect of employment on in-work poverty: employment can lift households out of poverty but it can also increase the number of poor workers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> in the Netherlands from 1996 until 2005 and examines whether <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> is related to recent social security and welfare state reforms (a new ideology of an ‘activating welfare state’ and numerous policy measures {{to reduce the number}} of social benefit claimants and to promote work). Using large-scale administrative data (from the Dutch tax services) we found that the <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> risk in the Netherlands was quite constant (fluctuating between 5. 3 and 6. 6 percent). We expected that because of the social security reforms more individuals with vulnerable labour market positions are pushed into the labour market but are nevertheless unable to escape from poverty. This would result in more working individuals below the poverty line. However, this is not the case. But even with a constant <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> risk the number of working poor individuals increases over the years. As a result, there is a gradual shift within the Dutch poverty population from non-working to working poor. We conclude that <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> – once the typical face of poverty in liberal welfare states such as the USA – also became a familiar phenomenon in the Netherlands. The majority of the Dutch working poor belongs to this category for only one year. However, a limited but significant number of individuals is working poor for three years or more. <b>In-work</b> <b>poverty</b> occurs relatively often after individuals experience a transition from social benefits (particularly social assistance) to work...|$|E

40|$|Recent studies find <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> to be a pan-European phenomenon. Yet <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> {{has come}} to the fore as a policy issue only {{recently}} in most continental European countries. Policies implemented in the United States and the United Kingdom, most notably in-work benefit schemes, are much discussed. This article argues that if it comes to preventing and alleviating poverty among workers, both the policy options and constraints facing Continental European policymakers are fundamentally different from those facing Anglo-Saxon policymakers. Consequently, policies that work in one setting cannot be simply emulated elsewhere. We present micro-simulation derived results for Belgium to illustrate some of these points. Policy options discussed and simulated include: higher minimum wages, reductions in employee social security contributions, tax relief for low-paid workers, and the implementation of a stylised version of the British Working Tax Credit. The latter measure has the strongest impact on <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> but in settings where wages are compressed, as in Belgium, a severe trade-off between coverage and budgetary cost presents itself. The article concludes that looking beyond targeted measures to universal benefits and support for employment of carers may be important components of an overall policy package to tackle <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty.</b> negative income taxes, <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty,</b> low pay, in-work benefits...|$|E
30|$|The {{overall change}} in <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> is {{attributed}} to the relative contribution {{of the change in}} the part-time poverty risk, the change in the full-time poverty risk, and the change in the share of part-time workers to Eq.  1. In addition, we also look at how the poverty rate of part-time workers changed by the share of involuntary part-timers and the changes in the poverty risk of voluntary and involuntary part-time workers (Eq.  2). Lastly, we apply a probit model, controlling for the typical <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> mechanisms (Lohmann 2009; Goerne 2011) and including time dummies to gain a more fine-grained perspective on the changes in <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> in general and whether and why part-time employment became more problematic in Europe.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{regards the}} {{incidence}} of <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> {{and how it is}} reduced by the payment of social transfers in 20 European countries. It combines a micro- and a macro-level perspective in two-level models. The basis for the analysis is micro-data from the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) 2005 and macro-data from sources such as the OECD and Eurostat. The broad comparative perspective allows for a separation of different institutional influences, namely the influence of the degree of decommodification, defamilisation and bargaining centralisation. In contrast to previous studies on the working poor which have mainly described country differences in <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty,</b> this paper focuses on the question of how such differences can be ex-plained from a broader perspective of poverty research. In general, the results confirm the overall hypothesis that both welfare state measures and labour market institutions have an influence on <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty.</b> By analysing influences on pre-transfer poverty and poverty reduction separately, I show that such factors have varied effects on <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty.</b> While bargaining centralisation proves to be relevant for the distribution of pre-transfer incomes only, the set-up of the social security system in particular im-pacts the extent of poverty reduction. ...|$|E
40|$|Single-parent {{families}} face unique challenges when {{it comes}} to <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty.</b> Without a second caregiver and earner, single parents have to compete with dual-earner couples for their position in the earnings distribution. Facing precarious employment and gendered wage inequality, single-parent families face a high risk to experience poverty even when they are working. This chapter presents empirical evidence on <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> and inadequate wages in the policy context of 18 OECD countries. The impact of family structure, occupation, regulations of part-time work, paid parental leave, and various redistributive policies are examined. We distinguish three distinct patterns of performance in countries' approach to <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> among single parents: A balanced approach of ensuring low inequality on the labor market combined with redistribution, an unbalanced approach of combating <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> mostly through redistribution, and an approach in which high inequality on the labor market is compensated with redistributive policies only to a very limited extent. Countries that rely on a balanced approach to reduce inequality on the labor market, both with respect to class and gender, combined with an adequate level of redistribution, seem best situated for a durable reduction of poverty among working single parents...|$|E

The analy-ses are based on micro data from the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) of 2006 and macro data from different sources. The analyses distinguish between different steps in the process of income generation and redistribution. The starting point is the question whether a person's own income from work is sufficient to avoid poverty. Further steps regard the role of the household context (needs and further income) and the effect of state redistribution (taxes and transfers).

30|$|As regards individual-level {{characteristics}} {{we control}} for in model 2, {{we see that}} women, low skilled, youngsters, and people not born {{in the country are}} more likely to be poor when working, confirming previous research (Lohmann 2009; Goerne 2011). As also expected from previous studies, overall resources and needs at the household level matter greatly for understanding <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty.</b> The poverty risk increases with the number of children, while it decreases with work intensity of other household members 5. Personal resources matter as well. Managers and professionals, who are more likely to earn more, and people with stable jobs have a lower poverty risk. From Table  2, we also see that workers who received some kind of unemployment benefit during the income reference period, indicating an insecure labour market attachment, {{are more likely to be}} poor than other workers. Yet, if we control for all possible types of benefits, <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> tends to be lower for those combining work and benefits.

30|$|The {{complexity}} of the working poor phenomenon can partially {{be traced back to}} its multi-layered definition and therefore deserves some attention. At the outset, research on <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> in Europe employed a variety of definitions, based on different approaches of what was meant by ‘being poor’ and ‘working’ (for an overview, see Crettaz and Bonoli 2010; Peña-Casas and Latta 2004). Both concepts come from different research traditions with different units of analysis and reference periods. Employment refers to an individual’s current labour market situations (ILO 1982), whereas the commonly adopted indicator for financial poverty in Europe is based on yearly disposable household income (Dennis and Guio 2003; Atkinson et al., 2002). EU-wide data development has stimulated the development of common indicators to measure social progress and also to the adoption of a standardized measurement of <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> based on EU-SILC data, {{often referred to as the}} ‘Eurostat definition’. Probably because the at-risk-of-poverty indicator was adopted as early as 2001 at the Laeken Council as a key indicator to monitor social inclusion (Atkinson et al. 2002), most of the critiques challenge the approach to measuring being ‘in-work’ 2. Definitions of who is ‘in-work’ may cover a broad spectrum of how much individuals actually work during the income reference period.|$|E
30|$|As far as policy {{responses}} are concerned, because household work intensity takes a central {{place in the}} variety of drivers of <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> in Europe, this should also be central in the debate when considering policy options to tackle <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> in general and also when focussing on specific group workers with low earnings. Broadly speaking, {{we can make a}} distinction between direct and indirect income support {{on the one hand and}} ‘incremental’ (augmenting existing provisions) and ‘new’ (which replace or complement existing provisions) policy options on the other (for a detailed discussion of policy options, see Marx and Nolan 2014). As regards involuntary part-time workers in particular, indirect income support through a facilitation of full-time participation appears a straightforward option. However, given the scarcity of work in times of crisis, this is perhaps in the short run not feasible. Furthermore, even for full-time full-year workers, single earnership is problematic from a poverty perspective if it has to cover the needs for an entire household with other non-working household members (Nolan et al. 2012). From a short-term income-protection objective, especially in times of crisis, direct income support through child benefits, substantial replacement income for unemployed adults, and/or in-work benefits appear the way forward.|$|E

30|$|The {{crisis has}} deepened {{pre-existing}} concerns regarding low-wage and non-standard employment. Countries where unemployment increased most strongly {{during the crisis}} period also saw part-time employment increasing, particularly involuntary part-time work. With involuntary part-time workers, as a particular group of underemployed, facing especially high poverty rates, this was accompanied by an increase, on average, in the poverty risk associated with working part-time. However, this was not reflected in a marked increase in the overall <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> rate because full-time work remains dominant and its poverty risk did not change markedly. The household context {{is of the essence}} when considering policy implications.|$|E
30|$|The global {{financial}} crisis has had important effects on work inequalities in Europe. Unemployment increased, {{in some cases}} dramatically, and even those countries that avoided widespread lay-offs through short-time working or partial unemployment schemes now face greater labour market segmentation. Non-standard employment has become more important, with temporary jobs sometimes {{the first to go}} when the crisis hit but more common among those then created, and with part-time employment growing throughout the crisis (Leschke 2012). Net job destruction coincided with an increase in precarious employment, especially involuntary part-time work (European Commission (2013 a, 2014)). However, to date, concern about these developments has focused primarily on the implications for the individual in the labour market, both in terms of current pay penalty and chances of progressing in the future. The impact on poverty affecting their households has received little attention, even though part-time workers are known to be more likely than full-timers to be poor, especially when involuntarily part-time (Horemans and Marx 2013). This neglect is perhaps linked to the fact that <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> as a whole has not generally risen during the crisis (Marx and Nolan 2014). That is the gap this paper seeks to fill, by reviewing what happened to the extent of part-time work, and particularly involuntary part-time, across EU member states and investigating its impact on poverty for those affected and on the extent of <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> more broadly.|$|E

A structured sample survey post living wage implementation of approximately 500 employees employed {{at the three}} project partner organisations who earn up to £ 10 per hour. This project provides a unique and valuable opportunity for a team of social scientists from the University of York and three important employers from the York labour market (City of York Council, Joseph Rowntree Foundation/Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust and York St John University) to collaborate on an applied research project, using mixed-methods research to underpin a knowledge exchange. The research project and knowledge exchange will focus on one specific geographical labour market, York. However the challenges currently being faced by these three employers are not York specific.

40|$|Earnings {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{relevant}} dimensions of job quality. They are the main reward within the employment relation, the one most valued by workers and the most multi-faceted instrument for achieving other goals. Very frequently, it is also closely associated with other objective and subjective dimensions of employment quality. Still, sociological and politics research only rarely consider the monetary components of employment quality. In the last two decades, different factors stemming from the process of globalization, the evolution of the economy, changes in the labour market and social protection institutions and policies have led to changes in the level and patterns of earnings and income inequality. This contribution does not intend to draw a detailed picture of the state of that research; it rather aims to provide a quick glance into the situation and the most recent long or medium-term wage trends in a comparative international and European perspective. It is divided into 6 sections. The first deals with our level of knowledge about the impact of economic globalization on earnings inequalities. Sections 2 and 3 are devoted to the dynamics and present situation of the incidence of low paid work and <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> respectively. Section 4 reflects on the different social, labour market and tax policies that may potentially rescue people from low pay and <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty.</b> Section 5 evaluates existing data and indicators. Finally, section 6 includes some tentative proposals for future research...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the role of minimum wages, tax and benefit {{policies}} in protecting workers against financial poverty, covering 21 European countries with a national minimum wage and three US States (New Jersey, Nebraska and Texas). It is shown that only for single persons and only in a number of countries, net income packages at minimum wage level reach or exceed the EU's at-risk-of poverty threshold, set at 60 per cent of median equivalent household income in each country. For lone parents and sole breadwinners with a partner and children to support, net income packages at minimum wage are below this threshold almost everywhere, usually by a wide margin. This is the case despite shifts over the past decade towards tax relief and additional income support provisions for low-paid workers. We argue that there appear to be limits to what minimum wage policies alone can achieve in the fight against <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty.</b> The route of raising minimum wages to eliminate poverty among workers solely reliant on it seems to be inherently constrained, especially in countries where the distance between minimum and average wage levels is already comparatively small and where relative poverty thresholds are mostly a function of the dual-earner living standards. In order to fight <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> new policy routes need to be explored. The paper offers a brief discussion of possible alternatives and cautions against 'one size fits all' policy solutions...|$|E
40|$|Economists explain welfare {{dependency}} of {{the unemployed}} and <b>in-work</b> <b>poverty</b> {{by the low}} labour market quality of the poor. Work {{can be made to}} pay by working family tax credits. But these might lower wages and price non-recipients out of the market, widening the eligibility for the wage supplementation and raising social welfare bills. This was precisely the effect of the Speenhamland system of wage supplementation of the early 19 th Century which permanently affected labour markets, and attitudes to welfare and the poor. The possibility of working family tax credit having a similar effect cannot be ruled out. Wage supplementation, welfare to work and labour markets...|$|E
