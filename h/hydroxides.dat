5|$|The <b>hydroxides</b> {{themselves}} {{are the most}} basic <b>hydroxides</b> known, reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give oligomeric alkoxides. They easily react with carbon dioxide to form carbonates or bicarbonates, or with hydrogen sulfide to form sulfides or bisulfides, and {{may be used to}} separate thiols from petroleum. They react with amphoteric oxides: for example, the oxides of aluminium, zinc, tin, and lead react with the alkali metal <b>hydroxides</b> to give aluminates, zincates, stannates, and plumbates. Silicon dioxide is acidic, and thus the alkali metal <b>hydroxides</b> can also attack silicate glass.|$|E
5|$|Decomposition {{of certain}} salts of uranium, for example UO2(NO3)·6H2O in air at 400°C, yields orange or yellow UO3. This oxide is {{amphoteric}} and forms several <b>hydroxides,</b> {{the most stable}} being UO2(OH)2.|$|E
5|$|Other {{polonium}} compounds include potassium polonite as a polonite, polonate, acetate, bromate, carbonate, citrate, chromate, cyanide, formate, (II) and (IV) <b>hydroxides,</b> nitrate, selenate, selenite, monosulfide, sulfate, disulfate and sulfite.|$|E
50|$|When one {{molecule}} of base via complete ionization produces two <b>hydroxide</b> ions, {{the base}} {{is said to be}} diacidic. Examples of diacidic bases are:Barium <b>hydroxide,</b> magnesium <b>hydroxide,</b> calcium <b>hydroxide,</b> zinc <b>hydroxide,</b> iron(II) <b>hydroxide,</b> tin(II) <b>hydroxide,</b> lead(II) <b>hydroxide,</b> copper(II) <b>hydroxide,</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|Sodium <b>hydroxide,</b> {{potassium}} <b>hydroxide,</b> silver <b>hydroxide,</b> ammonium <b>hydroxide,</b> etc.|$|R
25|$|The {{reaction}} {{is carried out}} at elevated temperature, and beside sodium <b>hydroxide</b> or potassium <b>hydroxide,</b> calcium <b>hydroxide,</b> barium <b>hydroxide,</b> magnesium <b>hydroxide</b> or carbonates of alkali or alkaline earth metals can be used.|$|R
5|$|The oxides and <b>hydroxides</b> of {{neptunium}} {{are closely}} related to its ions. In general, Np <b>hydroxides</b> at various oxidation levels are less stable than the actinides before it on the periodic table such as thorium and uranium and more stable than those after it such as plutonium and americium. This phenomenon is because the stability of an ion increases as the ratio of atomic number to the radius of the ion increases. Thus actinides higher on the periodic table will more readily undergo hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|Some ions are classed as amphoteric, {{being able}} to react with either an acid or a base. This is also true of some {{compounds}} with ionic character, typically oxides or <b>hydroxides</b> of less-electropositive metals (so the compound also has significant covalent character), such as zinc oxide, aluminium hydroxide, aluminium oxide and lead(II) oxide.|$|E
5|$|These bases {{are poorly}} {{soluble in water}} and by their {{activity}} {{are close to the}} <b>hydroxides</b> of rare-earth metals. The strongest base is of actinium. All compounds of actinium are colorless, except for black actinium sulfide (Ac2S3). Dioxides of tetravalent actinides crystallize in the cubic system, same as in calcium fluoride.|$|E
50|$|Like iron(II) <b>hydroxide,</b> cobalt(II) <b>hydroxide</b> {{is a basic}} <b>hydroxide.</b> It form Co(H2O)62+ in acidic aqueous solutions. In strong bases, cobalt(II) <b>hydroxide</b> accepts {{additional}} <b>hydroxide</b> ions to form {{dark blue}} cobaltates(II) Co(OH)42− and Co(OH)64−.|$|R
2500|$|Copper(II) <b>hydroxide</b> is the <b>hydroxide</b> of {{the copper}} with the {{chemical}} formula of Cu(OH)2. It is {{a pale blue}} solid. Some forms of copper(II) <b>hydroxide</b> are sold as [...] "stabilized" [...] copper <b>hydroxide,</b> although they likely consist of a mixture of copper(II) carbonate and <b>hydroxide.</b> Copper <b>hydroxide</b> is a weak base.|$|R
50|$|Lye in {{the form}} of both sodium <b>hydroxide</b> and {{potassium}} <b>hydroxide</b> is used in making soap. Potassium <b>hydroxide</b> soaps are softer and more easily dissolved in water than sodium <b>hydroxide</b> soaps. Sodium <b>hydroxide</b> and potassium <b>hydroxide</b> are not interchangeable in either the proportions required or the properties produced in making soaps.|$|R
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react vigorously or explosively with cold water, {{producing}} an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas. This reaction becomes more vigorous {{going down the}} group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, {{of which there are}} two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by {{the first part of the}} reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water). The alkali metal <b>hydroxides</b> are the most basic known <b>hydroxides.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{decomposes}} {{rapidly in}} solutions of ammonium acetate or the acetates, carbonates, citrates, or <b>hydroxides</b> of the alkali metals. It is stable in dry air, but gradually hydrolyses {{in contact with}} moisture to acetic and salicylic acids. In solution with alkalis, the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate.|$|E
5|$|Mercury(II) oxide, {{the main}} oxide of mercury, arises when the metal {{is exposed to}} air for long periods at {{elevated}} temperatures. It reverts to the elements upon heating near 400°C, as was demonstrated by Joseph Priestley in an early synthesis of pure oxygen. <b>Hydroxides</b> of mercury are poorly characterized, as they are for its neighbors gold and silver.|$|E
5000|$|Copper(II) <b>hydroxide</b> is the <b>hydroxide</b> of {{the copper}} with the {{chemical}} formula of Cu(OH)2. It is {{a pale blue}} solid.

5000|$|Aqueous {{potassium}} <b>hydroxide</b> {{is employed}} as the electrolyte in alkaline batteries based on nickel-cadmium, nickel-hydrogen, and manganese dioxide-zinc. Potassium <b>hydroxide</b> is preferred over sodium <b>hydroxide</b> because its solutions are more conductive. [...] The Nickel Metal Hydride batteries in the Toyota Prius use {{a mixture of}} potassium <b>hydroxide</b> and sodium <b>hydroxide.</b> Nickel-iron batteries also use potassium <b>hydroxide</b> electrolyte.|$|R
5|$|Uranium is {{extracted}} from its ores in various ways. In one method, the ore is burned and then reacted with nitric acid to convert uranium into a dissolved state. Treating the solution {{with a solution}} of tributyl phosphate (TBP) in kerosene transforms uranium into an organic form UO2(NO3)2(TBP)2. The insoluble impurities are filtered and the uranium {{is extracted}} by reaction with <b>hydroxides</b> as (NH4)2U2O7 or with hydrogen peroxide as UO4·2H2O.|$|E
5|$|A more {{detailed}} procedure adopted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was as follows: the initial mixture of actinides is processed with ion exchange using lithium chloride reagent, then precipitated as <b>hydroxides,</b> filtered and dissolved in nitric acid. It is then treated with high-pressure elution from cation exchange resins, and the berkelium phase is oxidized and extracted {{using one of}} the procedures described above. Reduction of the thus-obtained berkelium(IV) to the +3 oxidation state yields a solution, which is nearly free from other actinides (but contains cerium). Berkelium and cerium are then separated with another round of ion-exchange treatment.|$|E
5|$|Actinide salts {{can also}} be {{obtained}} by dissolving the corresponding <b>hydroxides</b> in acids. Nitrates, chlorides, sulfates and perchlorates of actinides are water-soluble. When crystallizing from aqueous solutions, these salts forming a hydrates, such as Th(NO3)4·6H2O, Th(SO4)2·9H2O and Pu2(SO4)3·7H2O. Salts of high-valence actinides easily hydrolyze. So, colorless sulfate, chloride, perchlorate and nitrate of thorium transform into basic salts with formulas Th(OH)2SO4 and Th(OH)3NO3. The solubility and insolubility of trivalent and tetravalent actinides is like that of lanthanide salts. So phosphates, fluorides, oxalates, iodates and carbonates of actinides are weakly soluble in water; they precipitate as hydrates, such as ThF4·3H2O and Th(CrO4)2·3H2O.|$|E
50|$|Some organic bases, such as {{tetramethylammonium}} <b>hydroxide,</b> tetrabutylammonium <b>hydroxide,</b> or choline <b>hydroxide</b> are <b>hydroxide</b> donors {{rather than}} proton acceptors like the above compounds. However, {{they are not}} always stable. Choline <b>hydroxide,</b> for example, is metastable and slowly breaks down to release trimethylamine.|$|R
25|$|Rubidium <b>hydroxide</b> {{is rarely}} used in {{industrial}} processes because potassium <b>hydroxide</b> and sodium <b>hydroxide</b> can perform {{nearly all the}} industrial functions of rubidium <b>hydroxide</b> in a less violent and hence safer way.|$|R
5000|$|This {{break down}} {{reaction}} {{is affected by}} the calcium <b>hydroxide</b> or the potassium <b>hydroxide</b> (both alkali). The resulting combinations of calcium <b>hydroxide</b> or potassium <b>hydroxide</b> and thioglycolic acid are calcium thioglycolate(CaTG) or potassium thioglycolate (KTG), respectively. The calcium <b>hydroxide</b> or potassium <b>hydroxide</b> are present in excess to enable the thioglycolic acid to react with the cystine present joining chains in hair protein. The reaction is: ...|$|R
5|$|Alkaline {{digestion}} {{is carried}} out in 30–45% sodium hydroxide solution at about 140°C for about three hours. Too high a temperature leads {{to the formation of}} poorly soluble thorium oxide and an excess of uranium in the filtrate, and too low a concentration of alkali leads to a very slow reaction. These reaction conditions are rather mild and require monazite sand with a particle size under 45μm. Following filtration, the filter cake includes thorium and the rare earths as their <b>hydroxides,</b> uranium as sodium diuranate, and phosphate as trisodium phosphate. This crystallises trisodium phosphate decahydrate when cooled below 60°C; uranium impurities in this product increase with the amount of silicon dioxide in the reaction mixture, necessitating recrystallisation before commercial use. The <b>hydroxides</b> are then dissolved at 80°C in 37% hydrochloric acid. Filtration of the remaining precipitates followed by addition of 47% sodium hydroxide results in the precipitation of thorium and uranium at about pH 5.8. Complete drying of the precipitate must be avoided, as then air may oxidise cerium from the +3 to the +4 oxidation state, and the cerium(IV) formed can then liberate free chlorine from the hydrochloric acid. The rare earths again precipitate out at higher pH. The precipitates are then neutralised by the original sodium hydroxide solution, although most of the phosphate must first be removed to avoid precipitating rare-earth phosphates. Solvent extraction may also be used to separate out the thorium and uranium, by dissolving the resultant filter cake in nitric acid. The presence of titanium hydroxide is deleterious as it binds thorium and prevents it from dissolving fully.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the simple}} oxide CaO, the {{peroxide}} CaO2 {{can be made}} by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Ca(O2)2. Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the <b>hydroxides</b> of strontium, barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of calcium are known. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals. Like strontium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
5|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characterisations of heavy metals {{need to be}} treated with caution, as the metals involved are not always consistently defined. As well as being relatively dense, heavy metals tend to be less reactive than lighter metals and have much less soluble sulfides and <b>hydroxides.</b> While it is relatively easy to distinguish a heavy metal such as tungsten from a lighter metal such as sodium, a few heavy metals, such as zinc, mercury, and lead, have some of the characteristics of lighter metals, and, lighter metals such as beryllium, scandium, and titanium, have some of the characteristics of heavier metals.|$|E

5|$|Before mendelevium's discovery, Seaborg and Katz {{predicted}} {{that it should}} be predominantly trivalent in aqueous solution and hence should behave similarly to other tripositive lanthanides and actinides. After the synthesis of mendelevium in 1955, these predictions were confirmed, first in the observation at its discovery that it eluted just after fermium in the trivalent actinide elution sequence from a cation-exchange column of resin, and later the 1967 observation that mendelevium could form insoluble <b>hydroxides</b> and fluorides that coprecipitated with trivalent lanthanide salts. Cation-exchange and solvent extraction studies led to the conclusion that mendelevium was a trivalent actinide with an ionic radius somewhat smaller than that of the previous actinide, fermium. Mendelevium can form coordination complexes with 1,2-cyclohexanedinitrilotetraacetic acid (DCTA).|$|E
5|$|Berkelium(III) and berkelium(IV) <b>{{hydroxide}}s</b> {{are both}} stable in 1 M sodium hydroxide solutions. Berkelium(III) phosphate (BkPO4) has been prepared as a solid, which shows strong fluorescence under argon laser (514.5nm line) excitation. Berkelium hydrides {{are produced by}} reacting metal with hydrogen gas at temperatures about 250 °C. They are non-stoichiometric with the nominal formula BkH2+x (0 < x < 1). Whereas the trihydride has a hexagonal symmetry, the dihydride crystallizes in an fcc structure with the lattice constant a = 523 pm. Several other salts of berkelium are known, including Bk2O2S, (BkNO3)3·4H2O, BkCl3·6H2O, Bk2(SO4)3·12H2O and Bk2(C2O4)3·4H2O. Thermal decomposition at about 600 °C in an argon atmosphere (to avoid oxidation to Bk2O) of Bk2(SO4)3·12H2O yields the body-centered orthorhombic crystals of berkelium(IV) oxysulfate (Bk2O2SO4). This compound is thermally stable to at least 1000 °C in an inert atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium oxides are basic; they easily {{convert to}} <b>hydroxides</b> and can form various salts, such as sulfates, phosphates, nitrates, etc. The nitrate is usually white {{but can be}} brown due to radiolytic decomposition. Heating the nitrate in air at 400°C {{converts}} it to the white protactinium pentoxide. The polytrioxophosphate Pa(PO3)4 can be produced by reacting difluoride sulfate PaF2SO4 with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) under inert gas atmosphere. Heating the product to about 900°C eliminates the reaction by-products such as hydrofluoric acid, sulfur trioxide and phosphoric anhydride. Heating to higher temperatures in an inert atmosphere decomposes Pa(PO3)4 into the diphosphate PaP2O7, which is analogous to diphosphates of other actinides. In the diphosphate, the PO3 groups form pyramids of C2v symmetry. Heating PaP2O7 in air to 1400°C decomposes it into the pentoxides of phosphorus and protactinium.|$|E
