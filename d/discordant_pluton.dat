50|$|Vertical {{migration}} of magma {{is driven by}} gravity. Stoping occurs when blocks of wall rock material are transferred downward through a pluton. Stoping is an important emplacement mechanism {{in a variety of}} tectonic setting and has been widely used to explain <b>discordant</b> <b>pluton</b> contacts. The most common signatures of stoping are sharp discordant contacts between plutons and wall rocks and a lack of ductile deformation of the wall rocks. Other characteristics of stoping include the presence of xenoliths in the plutons, evidence for the rotation of xenoliths and geochemical evidence of magma contamination.|$|E
40|$|The ~ 1. 8 Ga Nattanen-type granites in the Finnish Lapland {{and western}} Kola Peninsula are found as several {{relatively}} small, high-level, <b>discordant</b> <b>plutons</b> that are easily discernible as weak maxima on aeromagnetic maps. We present U–Pb mineral isotope {{data on the}} Finnishplutons. The concordia ages are in the 1. 79 − 1. 77 Ga range {{and there is little}} evidence for inheritance. Initial radiogenic isotope compositions (our common-Pb data combined with previously published whole-rock Nd and Hf data) imply a major, yet varying, Archeansource component. Elemental geochemical data on five Finnish intrusions (the Nattanen stock, the Tepasto and Pomovaara complexes, the Riestovaara and Vainospää batholiths), as well as associated dyke rocks allow the Nattanen-type granites to be classified as oxidizedA-type granites. Their petrogenesis may be related to partial melting of the lower crust by mafic underplating (extensional setting) or as a result of thermal relaxation in thickened crustal setting...|$|R
