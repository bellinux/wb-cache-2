While {{the value of}} nature-related tourism has been assessed, {{little is known about}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> plants on recreational choices. This study uses non-market valuation techniques for the first time to quantify the net benefit <b>of</b> managing <b>invasive</b> plants in upland areas. We surveyed 1436 Florida residents to determine their preferences for state parks using discrete choice experiment questions with various <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> plants and other attributes that impact visitation. Results imply that residents would be willing to pay $ 5. 41 per-visit to reduce the coverage <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> plants, $ 3. 72 to improve facilities, $ 3. 73 to increase the diversity of native plant species, and $ 6. 71 to increase the diversity of native animal species. Using score variables to capture interaction effects, demographic variables were found to influence the marginal willingness-to-pay for invasive species control by -$ 1. 13 to +$ 0. 97 per visit. Those who have taken action against or are more knowledgeable about invasive species were also found to influence a respondent's willingness to pay (+$ 2. 47 and +$ 0. 83, respectively). Respondents who consider invasive species to be beneficial (e. g., since many species were imported for their esthetics) would be willing to pay an additional $ 0. 80 per visit to a park with increased coverage. Using annual attendance data from 115 Florida state parks, we calculated statewide willingness-to-pay to manage invasive plants in upland parks. Park users would be willing to spend $ 89. 4 Â million annually to reduce the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> plants in the parks, which provides a baseline for evaluating control programs.

40|$|Abstract — Regime shifts {{refer to}} sudden {{changes in the}} {{structure}} or function of an eco-system due to external forces on the system. Such shifts arise because these systems have multiple equilibria so external disturbances may drive the state between different regions of attraction. Examples of such shifts include the shift in eutrophic state of shallow lakes in response to nutrient loading {{as well as the}} collapse of fisheries in response to the introduction <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> species. A key measure of an eco-system’s resilience to such shifts is measured by first passage times (FPT) between the basins of attraction for different equilibria. Prior work in eco-system management has assumed low-dimensional linearized models driven by Brownian motions. This paper uses sum-of-square (SOS) programs to bound FPT probabilities for more complex nonlinear population processes in which the primary disturbance is a Poisson jump process.

At three study areas in southern New England, we examined the interaction of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) herbivory and three <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> shrub control over seven growing seasons on the dynamics of nine herbaceous and shrub guilds. Although evidence of synergistic interactions was minimal, the separate effects <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> shrub control and deer herbivory on plant community composition and dynamics were profound.

With increasing intensity <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> shrub control, native shrubs and forbs became more dominant where deer herbivory was excluded, and native graminoids became progressively more dominant where deer herbivory remained severe. While deer exclusion and intensive invasive shrub control increased native shrubs and forbs, it also increased invasive vines.

The pollinator-mediated plant interactions that occur between native and exotic plants are of particular interest due to the increasing frequency of plant invasions worldwide. While effects <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> plant species on native plant pollination have been documented, the mechanisms that drive such interactions are poorly understood. This dissertation focuses on the mechanisms of pollinator-mediated interactions between native and invasive plants through the study of (i) the effects of floral neighborhood on the pollination of a native plant (Chapter 1), (ii) the influence <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> pollen deposited on native stigmas (Chapter 2), and (iii) the effects of an exotic plant on native reproductive fitness over the course of an invasion (Chapter 3). I explored how the heterospecific floral neighborhood affects pollinator visitation and composition of pollinator assemblages for native plant, Phacelia parryi. Through observations of pollination in natural patches of P. parryi, I found that floral neighborhood changed pollinator assemblage composition and that native bees were superior pollinators compared to nonnative honeybees (Chapter 1). Next, a series of hand pollination experiments was used to examine how pollen from the invasive Brassica nigra influences pre- and post-fertilization stages in Phacelia parryi. Mixed pollen applications resulted in deleterious effects on both seed set and pollen tube growth when compared to pure conspecific pollen deposition (Chapter 2). Finally, I tested the effects <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> B. nigra abundance on the reproductive fitness of Phacelia parryi by simulating four stages in invasion and measuring pollinator visitation, pollen deposition and seed set. Native individuals near the invasion and within areas <b>of</b> low <b>invasive</b> density showed the highest reproductive fitness resulting from facilitation of pollinator visits, while natives within areas <b>of</b> high <b>invasive</b> density showed high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> pollen deposition. Isolation from the invasive reduced native fitness as a result of low pollinator visitation and conspecific pollen receipt (Chapter 3). Collectively, these results underscore the importance of determining the mechanisms for pollinator-mediated interactions between native and exotic plants and present valuable information for the mitigation <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> plant species...|$|R

Extracorporeal CO 2 removal (ECCO 2 R) techniques have not been systematically evaluated in these patients. MethodsThis is a pilot study of a novel ECCO 2 R device that utilizes a single venous catheter with high CO 2 removal rates at low blood flows. Twenty hypercapnic patients with COPD received ECCO 2 R. Group 1 (n = 7) consisted of patients receiving noninvasive ventilation with a high likelihood <b>of</b> requiring <b>invasive</b> ventilation, group 2 (n = 2) consisted of patients {{who could not be}} weaned from noninvasive ventilation, and group 3 (n = 11) consisted <b>of</b> patients on <b>invasive</b> ventilation who had failed attempts to wean. ResultsThe device was well tolerated, with complications and rates similar to those seen with central venous catheterization. Blood flow through the system was 430. 5 ± 73. 7 mL/min, and ECCO 2 R was 82. 5 ± 15. 6 mL/min and did not change significantly with time. Invasive ventilation was avoided in all patients in group 1 and both patients in group 2 were weaned; PaCO 2 decreased significantly (P <. 003) with application of the device from 78. 9 ± 16. 8 mm Hg to 65. 9 ± 11. 5 mm Hg. In group 3, three patients were weaned, while the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> ventilatory support was reduced in three patients.

40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} {{suggest that the}} morphogenetic transition from the yeast form to pseudohyphae in Saccharomyces cerevisiae may be regulated by the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk). To examine this hypothesis, we mutated all of the G 1 cyclin genes in strains competent to form pseudohyphae. Interestingly, mutation of each G 1 cyclin results in a different filamentation phenotype, varying from a significant defect in cln 1 /cln 1 strains to enhancement of filament production in cln 3 /cln 3 strains. cln 1 cln 2 double mutants are more defective in pseudohyphal development and haploid invasive growth than cln 1 strains. FLO 11 transcription, which correlates with the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> growth, is low in cln 1 cln 2 mutants and high in grr 1 cells (defective in proteolysis of Cln 1, 2), suggesting that Cln 1, 2 /Cdks regulate the pseudohyphal transcriptional program.

The aim of the paper {{is to determine the}} variability in the incidence of non-native plant species (neophytes) associated with the change in altitude and links of the invading taxons to reference habitat types, as well as their links to three ecologically very similar, however in natural conditions, different areas. In general, the most invaded habitats are those which are highly influenced by human activities. Firstly, data collection was conducted through field mapping of build-up areas in South-western Slovakia. Subsequently, with the assistance of ordination methods, we evaluated the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> association <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> neophytes according to the set objectives.

Many invasive neophytes adapted to abandoned habitats of upland territory were also able to grow along roads, and vice versa, abandoned and unused habitats of lowland areas created conditions for many typical invasive neophytes occurring along roads and habitats of gardens and yards. Railways of lowland areas provided habitats and means <b>of</b> spread <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> woody neophytes.

We investigated the potential relationship between pre-hospitalization exposure to sources of fungi and the development <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> fungal infections in adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia after their first course of chemotherapy. From January 2010 to April 2012, all consecutive acute myeloid leukemia patients in 33 Italian centers were prospectively registered. Upon first admission, information about possible pre-chemotherapy risk factors and environmental exposure was collected. We recorded data regarding comorbid conditions, employment, hygienic habits, working and living environment, personal habits, hobbies, and pets. All invasive fungal infections occurring within 30 days after the first course of chemotherapy were recorded. Of the 1, 192 patients enrolled in this study, 881 received intensive chemotherapy and were included in the present analysis. Of these, 214 developed an invasive fungal infection, including 77 proven/probable cases (8. 7 %). Of these 77 cases, 54 were proven/probable invasive mold infections (6. 1 %) and 23 were proven yeast infections (2. 6 %). Upon univariate analysis, a significant association was found between invasive mold infections and age, performance status, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, cocaine use, job, hobbies, and a recent house renovation. Higher body weight resulted in a reduced risk <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> mold infections. Multivariate analysis confirmed the role of performance status, job, body weight, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and house renovation. In conclusion, several hospital-independent variables could potentially influence the onset <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> mold infections in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

40|$|Plant invasions have {{tremendous}} potential to alter food webs by changing basal resources. Recent studies document how plant invasions {{may contribute to}} increased arthropod abundances in detritus-based food webs. An obvious mechanism for this phenomenon—a bottom-up effect resulting from elevated <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> detritus from the invasive plant litter—has not been explicitly studied. We {{examined the effects of}} an annual grass invasion on ground arthropod assemblages in the coastal sage scrub (CSS) of southern California. Bottom-up food web theory predicts that the addition of detritus would increase generalist-feeding arthropods at all trophic levels; accordingly, we expected increases in fungi, Collembola, and common predators such as mites and spiders. For the common ant taxa, habitat alteration may also be important for predicting responses. Thus we expected that Forelius mccooki and Pheidole vistana, the most common ant species, would decline because of changes in soil temperature (F. mccooki) and habitat structure (P. vistana) associated with litter. We studied trends observationally and conducted a 3 -year experiment in which we manipulated litter quantity. In contrast to other published studies, most detritus-based arthropod taxa declined in areas of high grass invasion, and, within trophic levels, responses often varied idiosyncratically. For the two most common taxa, a native ant (F. mccooki), and predatory mites in the Anystidae, we experimentally linked declines in abundance to increased <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> grass litter. Such declines, especially those exhibited by the most common ant taxa, could have cascading effects on the CSS ecosystem, where ants are numerically dominant and thus may have broad influences on food web and ecosystem properties. Our results highlight that accurately predicting arthropod responses to invasive plant litter requires careful consideration of the structural and food resources provided by detritus to each particular food web...|$|R

The optimality conditions show that it is economically efficient to spend a larger share of outlays for exclusion activities before, rather than after, a species is first discovered, up to a threshold point. We also find that, after discovery, more exclusionary measures and fewer control measures are optimal, when the pest population is less than a threshold. As the pest population increases beyond this threshold, the exclusionary measures are no longer optimal. Finally, a comparative dynamic analysis indicates that the efficient <b>level</b> <b>of</b> total expenditures on preventive and control measures decreases with the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the <b>invasive</b> species stock and increases with the intrinsic population growth rate, the rate of additional discoveries avoided, and the maximum possible pest population. invasive species, exclusion, control, eradication, public expenditures, Environmental Economics and Policy, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

Due to the relative ease of capture, small mammal community diversity is a key tool for quantifying overall ecosystem health. Studies examining small mammal communities are numerous; however {{there have been few}} studies that have examined the effects of changing vegetation structure on rodent community dynamics of native animal species in cold-desert ecosystems. The loss of vegetative diversity is an area of concern in desert and shrub-steppe communities as invasive species such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) provoke large changes in vegetation composition and structure. The health of these systems is vital to the conservation and management of sensitive species including the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). Small mammal communities are also vital prey for a host of mammalian and avian predators. The impact of cheatgrass expansion on small mammal communities remains largely unexplored. In this study we examined community level small mammal responses to changes in microhabitat features, including <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> species dominance. In the summers of 2010 - 2013, we sampled small mammals using Sherman live traps and measured vegetation structure using the line-point intercept method. Using estimates of richness, diversity, biomass and number of captures (i. e., response variables), we developed generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to test the predictor variables percent invasive species (predominantly cheatgrass), plant species richness, percent openness, percent shrubs, and percent litter. Final results are pending but preliminary findings suggest a negative relationship between percent invasive species and small mammal species richness and diversity, and a non-linear relationship between percent invasive species and biomass and number of captures.

Therefore, it is important that the tourism industry contributes to, rather than deters, the progress of sustainability practices. We believe that releasing this dataset will help increase public awareness of and interest in the trend of implementing sustainability practices among tourism businesses in Minnesota.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is {{the most}} common cause of hospital-acquired infection. Because of the {{emergence}} of antibiotic-resistant strains, these infections represent a serious public health threat. To develop a broadly protective vaccine, we tested cell wall-anchored surface proteins of S. aureus as antigens in a murine model of abscess formation. Immunization with four antigens (IsdA, IsdB, SdrD, and SdrE) generated significant protective immunity that correlated with the induction of opsonophagocytic antibodies. When assembled into a combined vaccine, the four surface proteins afforded high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> protection against <b>invasive</b> disease or lethal challenge with human clinical S. aureus isolates...|$|R
40|$|The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> {{invasion}} varies {{according to}} the habitat type. The aim {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> invasion in the basin of the Ploučnice River in North Bohemia. The values <b>of</b> the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> invasion were quantified for vegetation plots from the Czech National Phytosociological Database and for segments of riverbank vegetation which were mapped at own field research. Ten maps showing the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> invasion by alien plants were developed based on a quantitative assessment <b>of</b> the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> invasion of particular habitat types at different altitudes. The <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> invasion were measured as proportion of the species that are aliens and total cover of alien species, the same was done for archeophytes and neophytes separately. The other option to quantify the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> invasion was using <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> count <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> neophytes in the riverbank vegetation. Within each habitat the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> invasion was related to altitude. If the relation was significant, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> invasion in that habitat was extrapolated according to that relation to altitude. Mean <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> invasion were used for the habitats which the relation was non-significant for. The west, northeast and the central parts of the assessed basin were evaluated as the most invaded areas. It is caused by the occurrence of the most invaded [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} trauma degree <b>of</b> para-median {{minimally}} <b>invasive</b> and open TLIF for single segmental lumbar degenerative {{disease and the}} effect on spinal cord function. Methods: A total of 78 cases of patients with single segmental lumbar disc herniation who received TLIF treatment in our hospital were selected as the research subjects and randomly divided into two groups, minimally invasive group received para-median minimally invasive TLIF and open group received open TLIF. Perioperative serum <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> oxidative stress indicators and pain mediators as well as spinal cord function were compared between two groups. Results: 1 d and 3 d after operation, serum SOD, GSH-Px and SP <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> minimally <b>invasive</b> group {{were significantly higher than}} those of open group, and MDA, AOPP, NO, β-EP, PGE 2 and CGRP levels were significantly lower than those of open group; 1 week after operation, NCV and DL of common peroneal nerve and tibial nerve of two groups were not different from those before operation; 4 weeks and 16 weeks after operation, NCV of common peroneal nerve and tibial nerve of both groups were higher than those before operation while DL were lower than those before operation, and NCV of common peroneal nerve and tibial nerve <b>of</b> minimally <b>invasive</b> group were significantly higher than those of open group while DL were significantly lower than those of open group. Conclusion: The trauma degree <b>of</b> para-median minimally <b>invasive</b> TLIF for single segmental lumbar degenerative disease is less and the postoperative spinal cord function recovery is more ideal...|$|R
50|$|Large-scale rat control {{programs}} {{have been taken to}} maintain a steady <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the <b>invasive</b> predators in order to conserve the native species in New Zealand such as kokako and mohua. Pesticides, such as pindone and 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate), are commonly distributed via aerial spray by helicopter as a method of mass control on islands infested with invasive rat populations. Bait, such as brodifacoum, is also used along with coloured dyes in order to kill and identify rats for experimental and tracking purposes. Another method to track rats is the use of wired cage traps, which are used along with bait, such as rolled oats and peanut butter, to tag and track rats to determine population sizes through methods like mark-recapture and radio-tracking. Poison control methods are effective in reducing rat populations to nonthreatening sizes, but rat populations often rebound to normal size within months. Besides their highly adaptive foraging behavior and fast reproduction, the exact mechanisms for their rebound is unclear and are still being studied.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe authors {{investigated}} {{the role of}} known risk factors in educational differences in breast cancer incidence. Analyses {{were based on the}} European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition and included 242, 095 women, 433 cases of in situ breast cancer, and 4, 469 cases <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> breast cancer. Reproductive history (age at first full-term pregnancy and parity), exposure to endogenous and exogenous hormones, height, and health behaviors were accounted for in the analyses. Relative indices of inequality (RII) for education were estimated using Cox regression models. A higher risk <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> breast cancer was found among women with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> education (RII = 1. 22, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 09, 1. 37). This association was not observed among nulliparous women (RII = 1. 13, 95 % CI: 0. 84, 1. 52). Inequalities in breast cancer incidence decreased substantially after adjusting for reproductive history (RII = 1. 11, 95 % CI: 0. 98, 1. 25), with most of the association being explained by age at first full-term pregnancy. Each other risk factor explained a small additional part of the inequalities in breast cancer incidence. Height accounted for most of the remaining differences in incidence. After adjusting for all known risk factors, the authors found no association between education <b>level</b> and risk <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> breast cancer. Inequalities in incidence were more pronounced for in situ breast cancer, and those inequalities remained after adjustment for all known risk factors (RII = 1. 61, 95 % CI: 1. 07, 2. 41), especially among nulliparous women...|$|R
40|$|Among recent {{advances}} in developing cellulosic and noncellulosic biofuel sources, corn, switchgrass, and others (e. g., camelina, canola) have risen to the top. In surveying the landscape, a potentially promising new area of bioenergy production exists—invasive plant species. The addition <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> plant species as a bioenergy source will help to diversify the nation’s energy dependence and help in {{the reduction of the}} negative environmental and social impacts from energy crop production. In addition, belowground carbon stores may provide an opportunity to reduce the impacts associated with global climate change. In the agriculture sector, harvesting equipment is well advanced for facilitating efficient crop production on both small and large scales. In noncrop systems, the number of limitations and lack of need have slowed the progress of equipment development for biomass harvesting (Graneli 1984). The lack of economic return is an important reason for less intensive management in noncrop areas. With new markets emerging for cellulosic energy sources and advances in equipment technology, this increased incentive could help improve the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> management <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> plant species in noncrop areas and subsequent harvest or removal of excess biomass. Using invasive plant species in bioenergy facilities would provide enticing opportunities for land managers and business developers. Since the primary focus <b>of</b> most <b>invasive</b> plant species management is on control of unwanted vegetation, the massive amounts of biomass from high cellulosic plants creates a challenge for disposal. Research has shown that piling or dispersing cut portions of many woody and herbaceous invasive plant species can result in the reestablishment by new plants from propagule segments (Boose and Holt 1999; Decruyenaere and Holt 2001). With advances in processing equipment, invasive plant species biomass could be processed into pellets for transporting to facilities that burn biomass or convert biomass to liquid biofuels. The processing <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> plant species into a useable form (i. e., pellets) that does not promote the spread or introduction of unwanted vegetation minimizes the risks of environmental contamination and provides an economic opportunity for business development in rural communities. While corn and switchgrass are the leading plant candidates for biofuel production, they {{may not be the most}} sustainable. Alternatively, the removal <b>of</b> existing <b>invasive</b> plant species biomass and processing into pellets for combustion or liquid fuel conversion maybe more sustainable as it would comply with the US Executive Order 13112 on invasive species (Clinton 1999), support climate change initiatives (Crowl et al. 2008), and expand economic opportunities in rural areas by helping fulfill the mandate by the US Renewable Fuels Standards (USDA 2010) ...|$|R
40|$|Haemophilus influenzae is a Gram-negative {{bacterium}} that {{is classified}} {{by the presence}} or absence of a polysaccharide capsule, termed “typeable” and “non-typeable” H. influenzae (NTHi), respectively. Depending on the capsular polysaccharide composition and antigenicity, typeable isolates are further subdivided into six serotypes designated a–f. H. influenzae type b (Hib) has been the most common serotype causing invasive disease, for example, meningitis, epiglottitis, septicaemia, and osteomyelitis in former decades. Since the introduction of a Hib vaccine, the incidence <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> Hib disease has significantly decreased. In contrast, the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> disease caused by other H. influenzae types, that is, NTHi and H. influenzae serotype f (Hif), is increasing, suggesting that NTHi and Hif are emerging pathogens. The mechanisms behind this emergence are not fully understood. To circumvent the bactericidal activities of the host antimicrobial peptides, complement system and nutritional immunity, many bacterial species, including H. influenzae, have evolved with several outer membrane proteins (OMPs) that play a role in subverting the host defense systems. This study covers the structural and functional analysis of three H. influenzae OMPs; Protein E (PE) from NTHi, Haemophilus Surface Fibril (Hsf) from Hib and, finally, Protein H (PH) from Hif, to understand the molecular pathogenicity of H. influenzae. We successfully crystallized and solved the atomic structure of the ubiquitous multifunctional surface protein PE at 1. 8 Å resolution. The detailed structure of PE highlights how this important virulence factor of H. influenzae has the capacity to simultaneously interact with host Vitronectin (Vn), Laminin (Ln), or Plasminogen (PLG), promoting bacterial pathogenesis. We also showed that H. influenzae acquired hemin on the surface via PE, and shared it with hemin-depleted co-cultured bacteria, that is, PE worked as a hemin storage reservoir for H. influenzae. The trimeric autotransporter Hsf interacts with Vn, contributing to Hib serum resistance, better adherence and internalization into host cells. In silico analysis and experimental results demonstrated that the architecture of the trimeric autotransporter Hsf is not straight but rather a twisted, doubled over “hairpin-like” structure. We characterized PH as Vn-binding protein of Hif and discovered that it recognized the C-terminal part of Vn (aa 352 – 362). We found that PH-dependent Vn binding resulted in better survival of Hif in human serum and increased bacterial adherence to alveolar epithelial cells. Structural information of these OMPs will increase knowledge of H. influenzae virulence mechanisms. In addition, to develop vaccines or drugs against H. influenzae, targeting of OMPs are a potential key to provide protection against infectious Haemophilus spp. disease. Hence, functional studies on OMPs of H. influenzae in combination with the structural data provide a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions...|$|R
30|$|Lisa enters her new {{hypothesis}} {{into her}} lab notebook as “In 2013, climate change {{contributed to an}} increase in UMEs in dolphins, manatees, and pelicans in the Indian River Lagoon,” giving the rationale that “…the information that I recently accessed implicating that climate change encouraged the intrusion <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> species into this particular ecosystem. These invasive species could limit the food supply for the larger mammals and warmer temperatures could also support growth of biotoxins that might cause UMEs,” and stating she would like to test her hypothesis by “Compar[ing] the UMEs in this estuary with the UMEs in an estuary that has colder temperature water. If they differ, look specifically at the <b>level</b> and types <b>of</b> <b>invasive</b> species and biotoxins.” Lisa’s desire to use a comparison group as part of testing her hypothesis and her saying there may be two possible causative factors, not a simple cause and effect relationship, were notable since use of a control group can indicate either a sophisticated understanding of scientific practices, namely the importance of a control, or a less sophisticated understanding indicating that all scientific investigations require controls.|$|R
