5|$|Agricultural runoff {{containing}} {{pesticide residues}} {{has also been}} concentrated in the lower river in greater amounts. Toxins derived from pesticides have led to fish kills; six of these events were recorded between 1964 and 1968 alone. The pesticide issue is even greater in streams and water bodies near agricultural lands irrigated by the Imperial Irrigation District with Colorado River water. In the Imperial Valley, Colorado River water used for irrigation overflows into the New and Alamo rivers and into the Salton Sea. Both rivers and the sea {{are among the most}} polluted bodies of water in the United States, posing dangers not only to aquatic life but to contact by humans and migrating birds. Pollution from agricultural runoff <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower river; the issue is also significant in upstream reaches such as Colorado's Grand Valley, also a major center of irrigated agriculture.|$|E

25|$|The {{city has}} a long and rich {{literary}} tradition. Although Uruguayan literature <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> authors of the capital (Horacio Quiroga was born in Salto and Mario Benedetti in Paso de los Toros, for instance), Montevideo has been and is {{the centre of the}} editorial and creative activity of literature.|$|E
25|$|Another {{widely known}} {{use of the}} {{indirect}} mood is describing actions in fictional literature (especially folklore) (could be considered as an equivalent of French Passé simple, except that in Lithuanian it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> past): Kartą gyvenęs kalvis, kuris turėjęs du sūnus – Once there lived a smith who had two sons.|$|E

Initial margin is set by the exchange.|$|E
25|$|The term Iran <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{modern state}} of Iran (Persia), but {{includes}} all the territory {{ruled by the}} Iranians, including Mesopotamia, Eastern Anatolia, all of the Caucasus and Central Asia. The concept of Greater Iran has its source {{in the history of}} the Achaemenid Empire in Persis (Pars), and overlaps to a certain extent with the history of Iran.|$|E
25|$|The colony {{cycle is}} the {{developmental}} period between one reproductive episode and the next. For swarm-founding species like A. pallipes, new colony reproduction {{is not necessarily}} coupled with queen production. Due to their region of preference, the neotropics, the onset of nest foundation varies {{over a number of}} months and even seasons exclusive of only the deepest of winter periods. Therefore, unlike its relatives in temperate regions, nest foundation <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the favorable season.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{internet}} slangs <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English language but extends to other languages as well. The Korean language has incorporated the English alphabet {{in the formation}} of its slang, while others were formed from common misspellings arising from fast typing. The new Korean slang is further reinforced and brought into everyday language use by television shows such as soap operas or comedy dramas like “High Kick Through the Roof” released in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Legal {{criticism}} of the perp walk <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> defense bar. Charles Hynes, former district attorney for New York City's borough of Brooklyn, opposed perp walks and refused to have those his office prosecuted subjected to them. In her novel Final Jeopardy, Linda Fairstein, {{former head of the}} Manhattan district attorney's sex crimes unit, has her main character, prosecutor Alexandra Cooper, ask a detective to hold off on the perp walk until all the victims have had the chance to pick the defendant out of a police lineup, since defense lawyers were often able to exclude such identifications made after the perp walk had been broadcast.|$|E
25|$|But ASR <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{intertidal}} environment. Most tropical and temperate {{fish species}} living in stagnant waters engage in ASR during hypoxia. One study looked at 26 species representing eight families of non-air breathing fishes from the North American great plains, {{and found that}} all but four of them performed ASR during hypoxia. Another study looked at 24 species of tropical fish common to the pet trade, from tetras to barbs to cichlids, and found {{that all of them}} performed ASR. An unusual situation in which ASR is performed is during winter, in lakes covered by ice, at the interface between water and ice or near air bubbles trapped underneath the ice.|$|E

25|$|B'nai B'rith's NGO role <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United Nations and its agencies. B'nai B'rith {{also has}} worked {{extensively}} with {{officials in the}} State Department, in Congress, and in foreign governments to support {{the efforts of the}} Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to combat anti-Semitism. With members in more than 20 Latin American countries, the organization was the first Jewish group to be accorded civil society status at the Organization of American States (OAS), where it has advocated for democracy and human rights throughout the region. B'nai B'rith's role in Latin America dates to the turn of the 20th century and grew considerably with the influx of Jewish refugees from Nazi Europe.|$|E
25|$|This {{screening}} process <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> viewing of Web sites, however. It also blocks users from discussing these forbidden keywords on chat {{programs such as}} Internet Relay Chat. Once these keywords are mentioned or certain individuals identified as undesirable enter the chat room, the user will be kicked off the discussion. When Tory Christman worked as an operative for OSA, other OSA operatives removed the program from her computer {{to allow her to}} analyze what critical material was being spread on the internet about Scientology. Some time after the software was removed, Christman encountered the Operation Clambake Web site and had online discussions with its operator Andreas Heldal-Lund, which eventually led to her leaving Scientology through a public announcement on Alt.religion.scientology.|$|E
25|$|Many {{different}} exegetical {{methods are}} employed {{in an effort to}} derive deeper meaning from a text. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> traditional thirteen textual tools attributed to the Tanna Rabbi Ishmael, which are used in the interpretation of halakha (Jewish law). The presence of words or letters which are seen to be apparently superfluous, and the chronology of events, parallel narratives or what are seen as other textual 'anomalies' are often used as a springboard for interpretation of segments of Biblical text. In many cases, a dialogue is expanded manifold: handfuls of lines in the Biblical narrative may become long philosophical discussions. It is unclear whether the midrash assumes these dialogues took place in reality or if this refers only to subtext or religious implication.|$|E

25|$|The city’s and municipality’s {{recent history}} has {{centered}} on violence related to drugs and the environment. Drug-related violence of {{the past several decades}} has taken its toll as tourism is down, fewer come to shop in the city and many residents stay indoors for fear of a stray bullet. The violence and threats of violence have left streets empty after 7 pm. Pickups and SUVs with darkened windows are a common sight. These vehicles are associated with the many shootings and even grenade attacks that have taken place in and around the city in recent years. The violence <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city of Petatlán; it also occurs in its small rural communities such as La Morena, El Camalote and Las Humedades. A number of these have been partly or fully abandoned as drug-related violence grows. The violence is among local drug lords over turf.|$|E
25|$|The {{powers of}} the {{legislature}} are checked {{by a number of}} devices: first, by certain constitutional limitations; second, by the president as defined under the constitution; and third, by the Constitutional Court. Articles 64, 131, and 132 of the constitution circumscribe the ability of the Seimas to control the Government, especially the budget. Article 64 specifies the times of parliamentary sessions. Although extension is possible, ordinarily the legislature cannot sit longer than seven months and three days, divided into two sessions. The budget submitted by the Government can be increased by the legislature only if the latter indicates the sources of financing for additional expenditures. If the budget is not approved {{before the start of the}} budget year, proposed expenditures cannot be higher than those of the previous year. Finally, the legislature is not entrusted with making decisions concerning the basic characteristics of Lithuanian statehood and democracy. These are left to the citizens by means of referendum. Similarly, the initiative for making laws <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> legislature but also belongs to the citizens, who can force the legislature to consider a law by submitting a petition with 50,000 signatures.|$|E
25|$|Evolution has {{provided}} the human body with two distinct features: the specialization of the upper limb for visually guided manipulation and the lower limb's development into a mechanism specifically adapted for efficient bipedal gait. While the capacity to walk upright {{is not unique to}} humans, other primates can only achieve this for short periods and at a great expenditure of energy. The human adaption to bipedalism <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> leg, however, but has also affected the location of the body's center of gravity, the reorganisation of internal organs, and the form and biomechanism of the trunk. In humans, the double S-shaped vertebral column acts as a shock-absorber which shifts the weight from the trunk over the load-bearing surface of the feet. The human legs are exceptionally long and powerful {{as a result of their}} exclusive specialization to support and locomotion— in orangutans the leg length is 111% of the trunk; in chimpanzees 128%, and in humans 171%. Many of the leg's muscles are also adapted to bipedalism, most substantially the gluteal muscles, the extensors of the knee joint, and the calf muscles.|$|E
