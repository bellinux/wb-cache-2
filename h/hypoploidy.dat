50|$|Multiple {{studies have}} found that {{micronuclei}} frequency in women is higher than in men and that the number of micronuclei increase until around 70 years of age. Micronuclei levels ranged from 0.5 to 1.4% in men to 0.9 to 1.8% in women. Gender-related differences were mainly seen in younger age groups (<= 50 years) with an almost two-fold difference between men and women. The patterns in the number of micronuclei after 70 years of age is controversial. Some studies have shown that in individuals over 70 years of age, micronucleus frequency increases in both sexes. On the other hand, other {{studies have found}} that in the oldest age groups, micronuclei frequencies level off. The deficiency of micronuclei in some of the oldest age groups may be {{explained by the fact that}} micro nucleated cells are preferentially eliminated by apoptosis. However, higher micronuclei frequency corresponds to a decreased efficiency of DNA repair and increased genomic instability, which are typical in older subjects. Age-related increases in micronuclei frequency also correspond well with age-related increases in the <b>hypoploidy</b> and the age-related increase in sex chromosome loss. Alternatively, the leveling off of frequency of micronuclei in older subjects would suggest a threshold of genomic instability that cannot be crossed if the person is to survive. If this were the case, women appear to reach this threshold faster than men.|$|E
40|$|While age-related sex {{chromosomal}} aneuploidy is a well-characterized phenomenon, {{the relationship}} between autosomal loss and age remains unclear. The emergence of the specific and highly sensitive {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) technology has enabled investigators to study interphase cells, thereby overcoming problems inherent with the study of metaphase spreads for acquired aneuploidy assessment. Despite all the advantages of this technique, there are some limitations that could be misleading when scoring interphase autosomal aneuploidy. In this study we show that sex chromosomal <b>hypoploidy</b> is correlated with age. By using a twin study design, we evaluated Y chromosome <b>hypoploidy</b> frequencies and found that loss of the Y chromosome {{is likely to be a}} multifactorial phenotype, being influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. An analysis of acquired aneuploidy frequencies for 13 autosomes in men showed that only one autosome, chromosome 3, had an age-related increase in acquired aberrations levels. Using a multi-probe study design, we determined that an apparent loss of fluorescent signal(s) could result from the coincident positioning (overlaying) of the repeat sequences targeted by the probes (due to either somatic homolog pairing or aggregation of the heterochromatic regions). Therefore, caution should be taken when performing autosomal FISH analysis to avoid overestimation of autosomal aneuploidy in uncultured leukocytes...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies from}} our {{laboratory}} {{have shown that}} ethanol consumption results {{in an increase in}} hepatocellular S-adenosylhomocysteine levels. Because S-adenosylhomocysteine is a potent inhibitor of methylation reactions, we propose that increased intracellular S-adenosylhomocysteine levels could be a major contributor to ethanol-induced pathologies. To test this hypothesis, hepatocytes isolated from rat livers were grown on collagen-coated plates in Williams’ medium E containing 5 % FCS and exposed to varying concentrations of adenosine in order to increase intracellular S-adenosylhomocysteine levels. We observed increases in caspase- 3 activity following exposure to adenosine. This increase in caspase activity correlated with increases in intracellular S-adenosylhomocysteine levels and DNA <b>hypoploidy.</b> The adenosine-induced changes could be significantly attenuated by betaine administration. The mechanism of betaine action appeared to be via the methylation reaction catalyzed by betaine-homocysteine-methyltransferase. To conclude, our results indicate that the elevation of S-adenosylhomocysteine levels in the liver by ethanol is a major factor in altering methylation reactions and in increasing apoptosis in the liver. We conclude that ethanol-induced alteration in methionine metabolic pathways may {{play a crucial role in}} the pathologies associated with alcoholic liver injury and that betaine administration may have beneficial therapeutic effects...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether fibroblasts from Blanco Orejinegro cattle, exhibit {{any level of}} resistance to infection against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) serotypes Indiana (VSV-I) or New Jersey (VSVNJ), 30 fibroblast cultures were phenotyped to evaluate their resistance/susceptibility. Thirty three % of Blanco Orejinegro fibroblast cultures were classified as very resistant, 50 % as resistant, and 17 % as susceptible to VSV-I infection, whereas 20 % were classified as very resistant, 50 % as resistant and 30 % as susceptible to VSV-NJ infection. Therefore, {{there appears to be}} a large variation in phenotypic polymorphism among the fibroblasts to infection by VSV. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for this diversity, we searched for a possible relationship between resistance/susceptibility and production of factors with antiviral activity; however fibroblasts did not secrete factors with antiviral activity. We examined also whether apoptosis where induced by infection and its correlation with the polymorphism of resistance/susceptibility to VSV. Using morphological analyses, <b>hypoploidy</b> measurements, and level of phosphatidyl serine expression, high levels of apoptosis were measured in VSV infected fibroblasts. However, no correlation exists between apoptosis and the category of resistance/susceptibility to infection, indicating that apoptosis is a pathogenic mechanism of VSV...|$|E
40|$|DNA-aneuploidy {{may reflect}} the {{malignant}} nature of mesenchymal proliferations and herald gross genomic instability as a mechanistic factor in tumor genesis. DNA-ploidy and -index were determined by flow cytometry in canine inflammatory or neoplastic mesenchymal tissues and related to clinico-pathological features, biological behavior and p 53 gene mutational status. Half of all sarcomas were aneuploid. Benign mesenchymal neoplasms were rarely aneuploid and inflammatory lesions not at all. The aneuploidy rate was comparable to that reported for human sarcomas with significant variation amongst subtypes. DNA-ploidy status in canines lacked a relation with histological grade of malignancy, in contrast to human sarcomas. While aneuploidy {{was related to the}} development of metastases in soft tissue sarcomas it was not in osteosarcomas. No relation amongst sarcomas was found between ploidy status and presence of P 53 gene mutations. Heterogeneity of the DNA index between primary and metastatic sarcoma sites was present in half of the cases examined. <b>Hypoploidy</b> is more common in canine sarcomas and hyperploid cases have less deviation of the DNA index than human sarcomas. The variation in the presence and extent of aneuploidy amongst sarcoma subtypes indicates variation in genomic instability.

40|$|The {{pathogenic}} role of antiendothelial cell antibodies (AECA) remains unclear. They {{are frequently}} associated with antibodies to anionic phospholipids (PL), such as phosphatidylserine (PS), which {{is difficult to}} reconcile with the distribution of PL molecular species within the plasma membrane. Since it is already known that PS is transferred to the outer face of the membrane as a preclude to apoptosis, the possibility exists that apoptosis is initiated by AECA. AECA-positive/anti-PL antibody-negative sera from eight patients with systemic sclerosis (SS) and 21 control patients were evaluated. Endothelial cells (EC) were incubated with AECA and the exposure of PS was established through the binding of annexin V. Hypoploid cell enumeration, DNA fragmentation, and optical and ultrastructural analyses of EC were used to confirm apoptosis. Incubation of EC with AECA derived from six of eight patients with SS led to the expression of PS {{on the surface of}} the cells. This phenomenon was significantly more frequent in SS (P < 0. 04) than in control diseases. The redistribution of plasma membrane PS preceded other events associated with apoptosis: <b>hypoploidy,</b> DNA fragmentation, and morphology characteristic for apoptosis. Apoptosis-inducing AECA did not recognize the Fas receptor. We conclude that AECA may be pathogenic by inducing apoptosis...|$|E

Cyclophosphamide induced genotoxicity indicated by increased number of aberrant cells and different types of structural chromosomal aberrations (gap, break, fragment and deletion) and numerical aberrations (<b>hypoploidy</b> and hyperploidy). In sperm morphology cyclophosphamide induced sperm abnormalities for both head and tail abnormalities. Pretreatment with {{grape seed oil}} (0. 1 ml/kg b. w. /day) or linseed oil (0. 1 ml/kg b. w. /day) for 14 days prior to an interperitoneal dose of cyclophosphamide (25 mg/kg b. w) reduced (P< 0. 05) the number of chromosomal aberrations and sperm abnormalities and also reduced the percentage of DNA fragmentation caused by cyclophosphamide.

40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 000 {{lymphocyte}} interphase nuclei per proband from 90 females and 138 males age 1 wk to 93 years {{were analyzed by}} in situ hybridization for loss of the X and Y chromosomes, respectively. Both sex chromosomes showed an age-dependent loss. In males, Y <b>hypoploidy</b> was very low up to age 15 years (0. 05 %) but continuously increased to a frequency of 1. 34 % in men age 76 - 80 years. In females, the baseline level for X chromosome loss {{is much higher than}} that seen for the Y chromosome in males. Even prepubertal females show a rate of X chromosome loss, on the order of 1. 5 %- 2. 5 %, rising to approximately 4. 5 %- 5 % in women older than 75 years. Dividing the female probands into three biological age groups on the basis of sex hormone function (51 years), a significant correlation of X chromosome loss versus age could clearly be demonstrated in women beyond age 51 years. Females age 51 - 91 years showed monosomy X at a rate from 3. 2 % to 5. 1 %. In contrast to sex chromosomal loss, the frequency of autosomal monosomies does not change during the course of aging: Chromosome 1 and chromosome 17 monosomic cells were found with a constant incidence of 1. 2 % and 1 %, respectively. These data also indicate that autosome loss in interphase nuclei is not a function of chromosome size...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Endogenous estrogens have {{significant}} immunomodulatory effects characterized as suppression of cell mediated immunity and stimulation of humoral immunity. Xenoestrogens are environmental estrogens that have endocrine impact, acting as estrogen agonists and antagonists but whose immune effects {{are not well}} characterized. Using CD 4 + Jurkat T cells as a model, the effects of representative xenoestrogens on T proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis were examined. Coumestrol (CM), a phytoestrogen, and tetrachlorodioxin (TCDD) in concentrations of 10 - 4 to 10 - 6 M significantly inhibited Jurkat T cell lymphoproliferation, whereas bisphenol A (BPA) and DDT had minimal effect, but did antagonize 17 -ÃŽÂ²-estrtadiol induced effects. Xenoestrogens, especially CM, produced accumulation of Jurkat T cells in G 2 /M phase, and subsequently induced apoptosis, particularly CM (% apoptotic cells = 30 Ã‚Â± 12 vs. control = 5 Ã‚Â± 2). These changes were associated with DNA fragmentation. BPA and DDT also induced DNA fragmentation but not significant DNA <b>hypoploidy.</b> Xenoestrogen Ã¢Â€Â“ CM, BPA, DDT, and TCDD - exposure suppressed bcl- 2 protein and mRNA transcript levels but augmented p 53 protein and mRNA transcripts. Human purified peripheral blood lymphocytes responded with similar significant cell cycle changes (G 0 /G 1 exodus and G 2 /M accumulation) for CM, BPA, and DDT exposure. These preliminary data, taken together, suggest that xenoestrogens have direct, compound-specific T lymphocyte effects that enhance our understanding of environmental modulation of immune and autoimmune responses...|$|E

Recently it have been identified the synthetic chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) derivatives HS- 1200 and cisplatin showed apoptisis-inducing activity on various cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. This study was undertaken to investigate the synergistic apoptotic effect of co-treatment with HS- 1200 and cisplatin on human tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells (SCC 25 cells). To investigate whether the co-treatment with HS- 1200 and cisplatin compared to each single treatment efficiently reduces the viability of SCC 25 cells, MTT assay was conducted.

40|$|Defects in the {{distribution}} of chromosomes during mitotic division such as sister chromatid nondisjunction or detachment of kinetochore microtubules at anaphase can give rise to aneuploid cells, for example to a monosomic and a trisomic daughter cell. It is well-known that aneuploidy contributes significantly to carcinogenesis. Also, a relationship between advanced chronological age and increased chromosomal aneuploidy has been reported for humans. In particular <b>hypoploidy</b> increases with age and several studies showed that sex chromosomes are preferentially lost, i. e. the X chromosome in females and the Y chromosome in males [1]. Changes in the copy number of chromosomes can be assessed by means of fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) in both metaphase spreads and interphase cells. However, since the latter technique allows the analysis of large populations within a short time and is able to uncover aneuploidy hidden in non-proliferating cells, it is preferentially used for numerical chromosome studies. To examine the effect of donor (cell) age as well as radiation exposure on the degree of aneuploidy, we established recently the FISH-technique for the analysis of interphase cells. In a first experiment we measured the spontaneous frequency of aneuploidy for chromosomes 7 and X in interphase lymphocytes of 2 female healthy donors of different age (25 and 50 years old). Peripheral blood was collected by venipuncture. Lymphocytes were isolated, fixed and pancentromeric DNA probes specific for the centromeric regions of chromosomes 7 and X were applied.

Two separate experimental trials were done. The first compared superovulation (SO, PMS on Day I of the cycle followed by hCG on Day 4) to natural ovulation. Natural mating was used. In the second series of trials, precocious super-ovulation (PSO, PMS on Day 1 followed by hCG on Day 3) was used. Since there is poor sperm transport in PSO females, direct uterine artificial insemination (Al) was used to achieve fertilization. The control animals in the second series of trials were naturally ovulating females subjected to the artificial insemination procedure. Of 785 embryos analyzed in the SO group, 9 (1. 1 %) were aneuploid (5 hyperploidy and 4 <b>hypoploidy)</b> and 8 (1. 0 %) showed triploidy. In the PSO group, artificial insemination resulted in a normal development rate of 85. 5 % up to the 2 -cell stage. A total of 2. 6 % karyotypically abnormal embryos, consisting of 5 (1. 1 %) aneuploid and 7 (1. 5 %) polyploid, were found among 460 embryos examined in PSO females. No {{significant difference in the}} incidence of chromosomal abnormalities was observed between the stages of development.

40|$|Mitochondrial {{alterations}} including permeability transition (PT) constitute critical {{events of}} the apoptotic cascade and are {{under the control of}} Bcl- 2 related gene products. Here we show that induction of PT is sufficient to activate CPP 32 -like proteases with DEVDase activity and the associated cleavage of the nuclear DEVDase substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Thus, direct intervention on mitochondria using a ligand of the mitochondrial benzodiazepin receptor or a protonophore causes DEVDase activation. In addition, the DEVDase activation triggered by conventional apoptosis inducers (glucocorticoids or topoisomerase inhibitors) is prevented by inhibitors off PT. The protease inhibitor N-benzyloxycabonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD. fmk) completely prevents the activation of DEVDase and PARP cleavage, as well as the manifestation of nuclear apoptosis (chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, <b>hypoploidy).</b> In addition, Z-VAD. fmk delays the manifestation of apoptosis-associated changes in cellular redox potentials (hypergeneration of superoxide anion, oxidation of compounds of the inner mitochondrial membrane, depletion of non-oxidized glutathione), as well as the exposure of phosphatidylserine residues in the outer plasma membrane leaflet. Although Z-VAD. fmk retards cytolysis, it is incapable of preventing disruption of the plasma membrane during protracted cell culture (12 - 24 h), even in conditions in which it completely blocks nuclear apoptosis (chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation). Electron microscopic analysis confirms that cells treated with PT inducers alone undergo apoptosis, whereas cells kept in identical conditions in the presence of Z-VAD. fmk die from necrosis. These observations are compatible with the hypothesis that PT could be a rate limiting step in both the apoptotic and the necrotic modes of cell death. In contrast, it would be the availability of apoptogenic proteases that would determine the choice between the two death modalities. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{hormone-refractory}} {{prostate cancer}} {{is associated with}} poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Members of the pyrrolo- 1, 5 -benzoxazepine (PBOX) family of compounds exhibit anti-cancer properties in cancer cell lines (including multi-drug resistant cells), ex vivo patient samples and in vivo mouse tumour models with minimal toxicity to normal cells. Recently, they have also been found to possess anti-angiogenic properties in vitro. However, both the apoptotic pathways and the overall extent of the apoptotic response induced by PBOX compounds tends to be cell-type specific. Since {{the effect of the}} PBOX compounds on prostate cancer has not yet been elucidated, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate if PBOX compounds induce anti-proliferative effects on hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells. We examined the effect of two representative PBOX compounds, PBOX- 6 and PBOX- 15, on the androgen-independent human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line, PC 3. PBOX- 6 and - 15 displayed anti-proliferative effects on PC 3 cells, mediated initially through a sustained G 2 /M arrest. G 2 /M arrest, illustrated as DNA tetraploidy, was accompanied by microtubule depolymerisation and phosphorylation of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl- 2 and Bcl-xL and the mitotic spindle checkpoint protein BubR 1. Phosphorylation of BubR 1 is indicative of an active mitotic checkpoint and results in maintenance of cell cycle arrest. G 2 /M arrest was followed by apoptosis illustrated by DNA <b>hypoploidy</b> and PARP cleavage and was accompanied by degradation of BubR 1, Bcl- 2 and Bcl-xL. Furthermore, sequential treatment with the CDK 1 -inhibitor, flavopiridol, synergistically enhanced PBOX-induced apoptosis. In summary, this in vitro study indicates that PBOX compounds may be useful alone or in combination with other agents in the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer...|$|E

A set of Y-autosome translocations with appropriately positioned breakpoints, therefore, can in principle be used to generate a non-overlapping set of deficiencies and duplications for the entire autosomal complement. —Using this method, we have succeeded in examining segmental aneuploids for 85 % of chromosomes 2 and 3 in order to assess the effects of aneuploidy and to determine the number and location of dosage-sensitive loci in the Drosophila genome (Figure 5). Combining our data with previously reported results on the synthesis of Drosophila aneuploids (see Lindsley and Grell 1968), the following generalities emerge. — 1. The X chromosome contains no triplo-lethal loci, few or no haplo-lethal loci, at least seven Minute loci, one hyperploid-sensitive locus, and one locus that is both triplo-abnormal and haplo-abnormal. 2. Chromosome 2 contains no triplo-lethal loci, few or no haplo-lethal loci, at least 17 Minute loci, and at least four other haplo-abnormal loci. 3. Chromosome 3 contains one triplo-lethal locus that is also haplo-lethal, few or no other haplo-lethal loci, at least 16 Minute loci, and at least six other haplo-abnormal loci. 4. Chromosome 4 contains no triplo-lethal loci, no haplo-lethal loci, one Minute locus, and no other haplo-abnormal loci. —Thus, the Drosophila genome contains 57 loci, aneuploidy for which leads to a recognizable effect on the organism: one of these is triplo-lethal and haplo-lethal, one is triplo-abnormal and haplo-abnormal, one is hyperploid-sensitive, ten are haplo-abnormal, 41 are Minutes, and three are either haplo-lethals or Minutes. Because of the paucity of aneuploid-lethal loci, it may be concluded that the deleterious effects of aneuploidy are mostly the consequence of the additive effects of genes that are slightly sensitive to abnormal dosage. Moreover, except for the single triplo-lethal locus, the effects of hyperploidy are much less pronounced than those of the corresponding <b>hypoploidy...</b>|$|E
