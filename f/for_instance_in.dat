40|$|By {{exploiting}} {{the ability of}} retroviruses to move genes into random sites of mammalian genomes and by exploiting some features of their replication, retrovirus vectors have been developed that select <b>for</b> <b>instances</b> <b>in</b> which the virus integrates into expressed genes. Since integrated proviruses tag transcriptionally active sites, the vectors provide a means to identify and isolate promoters active in different cell types. Furthermore, the viruses may be useful as insertional mutagens, since they select <b>for</b> <b>instances</b> <b>in</b> which integration occurs into expressed sites. This reduces the number of integrants needed to screen for loss of gene function and may enable genes controlling phenotypes in mammalian cells to be isolated...|$|R

5|$|Although the {{tradition}} {{declined in the}} early to mid-twentieth century, in part due to opposition from some local Christian clergy and changing social conditions, it was revived in new forms in the mid-to-latter part of the century.

5|$|During {{the late}} 1930s, though {{motivated}} by political and propaganda reasons, several cultural exchanges between Japan and Germany took place.

5|$|Although 300 {{mutations}} of ATP7B {{have been}} described, in most populations {{the cases of}} Wilson's disease are due to {{a small number of}} mutations specific for that population. <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> <b>in</b> Western populations the H1069Q mutation (replacement of a histidine by a glutamine at position 1069 in the protein) is present in 37–63% of cases, while in China this mutation is very uncommon and R778L (arginine to leucine at 778) is found more often.

5|$|An early {{structural}} {{application of}} the Pythagorean tiling appears {{in the works of}} Leonardo da Vinci, who considered it among several other potential patterns for floor joists. This tiling has also long been used decoratively, for floor tiles or other similar patterns, as can be seen <b>for</b> <b>instance</b> <b>in</b> Jacob Ochtervelt's painting Street Musicians at the Doorway of a House (1665). It has been suggested that seeing a similar tiling in the palace of Polycrates may have provided Pythagoras with the original inspiration for his theorem.|$|E

Around a decade later Bach prepared two Latin Magnificats by other composers for performance (BWV1082, BWV Anh. 30). Probably {{around the same time}} Bach performed BWV10 again.|$|E

Specifically, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the thirteenth/fourteenth-century Brut y Tywysogion, and the twelfth-century Chronicon ex chronicis record that a Norse-Gaelic fleet sailed up the River Usk, and ravaged the surrounding region. These sources further reveal that Gruffudd ap Rhydderch and his Norse-Gaelic allies later surprised and routed the English forces of Ealdred, Bishop of Worcester (died 1069).|$|E

5|$|Exclusion of all {{elements}} {{is based on}} properties of earlier actinides, which show a much wider variety of chemistry (<b>for</b> <b>instance,</b> <b>in</b> range of oxidation states) within their series than the lanthanides, and comparisons to scandium and yttrium are even less useful. However, these elements are destabilized, {{and if they were}} stabilized to more closely match chemistry laws, they would be similar to lanthanides as well. Also, the later actinides from californium onwards behave more like the corresponding lanthanides, with only the valence +3 (and sometimes +2) shown.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the 9thcentury the Pechenegs {{controlled}} the territories to the east and south of the Carpathians.

The Pechenegs were swept aside from their territories by the Cumans between 1064 and 1078. A late variant of the oldest Turkish chronicle, the Oghuz-name relates that the Cumans defeated many nations, including the Ulâq ("Romanians").
