After sea trials in early 1923 she was commissioned to the Royal Danish Navy on 23 May and subsequently went on tour, visiting the <b>Faeroe</b> <b>Islands,</b> Bergen, Leith and Gothenburg and South America.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a quarterly, game-theoretic {{model of the}} Northeast Atlantic mackerel to study the fishing strategies of five players, the EU, Norway, the <b>Faeroe</b> <b>Islands,</b> Iceland, and the international fishery on the high seas. Data on the spatial distribution of fish catches 1977 - 2011 are used to model changes {{in the distribution of}} the mackerel stock. The Nash equilibrium solutions predict a severe decimation of the stock through overfishing, either by parties (Iceland, the <b>Faeroe</b> <b>Islands)</b> that refuse to cooperate, or by a general absence of cooperation. There is a wide discrepancy between this prediction and reality, as the stock seems only moderately overexploited or not at all, despite non-cooperation by Iceland and the <b>Faeroe</b> <b>Islands.</b> It is conjectured that these parties, and others, may have a degree of implicit cooperation that falls somewhat short of full cooperation but avoids the extreme destruction of the Nash equilibrium. This implicit cooperation can be seen as being maintained by a mutually assured destruction of the fisheries of all parties in case they go to the logical extremes of non-cooperation...|$|R
