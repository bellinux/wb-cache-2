He also called the drama around Rachel and Jesse and Quinn and Finn [...] "superficial stuff", a view shared by Meghan Brown of The Atlantic who said much of the drama [...] "felt shallow and forced", except for the first Kurt and Karofsky scene, which she described as [...] "painful and poignant".

500|$|Many assertions {{about the}} year 2012 form part of Mayanism, a non-codified {{collection}} of New Age beliefs about ancient Maya wisdom and spirituality. The term is distinct from [...] "Mayanist," [...] {{used to refer to}} an academic scholar of the Maya. Archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni says that while the idea of [...] "balancing the cosmos" [...] was prominent in ancient Maya literature, the 2012 phenomenon did not draw from those traditions. Instead, it was bound up with American concepts such as the New Age movement, millenarianism, and the belief in secret knowledge from distant times and places. Themes found in 2012 literature included [...] "suspicion towards mainstream Western culture", the idea of spiritual evolution, and the possibility of leading the world into the New Age by individual example or by a group's joined consciousness. The general intent of this literature was not to warn of impending doom but [...] "to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism." [...] Aveni, who has studied New Age and search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a [...] "disconnected" [...] society: [...] "Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time—entities that <b>just</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> in possession of superior knowledge." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Carina Chocano praised The O.C. {{for being}} different, {{claiming}} {{that it was}} [...] "refreshingly free of both [...] Spelling-style camp and the twee earnestness that has characterized more recent teen dramas". Robert Bianco of USA Today drew comparisons with the successful Fox show Beverly Hills, 90210, saying that [...] "The O.C. is better-written and better-acted by a cast that <b>just</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> incredibly enough, even better-looking". He praised the cast's skill and attractiveness {{as well as the}} show's ability to [...] "come up with a few smart deviations from the genre norm". Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized the plot for being too predictable, but praised Adam Brody as Seth, stating that [...] "he talks too much and too fast, he mumbles, and he projects zero physical confidence. In short, his character is adorable." [...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that [...] " [...] McKenzie, at times, is prone to overdramatizing scenes", and considered the young characters [...] "so detestable and yet bland" [...] that it made the show [...] "almost painful" [...] to watch. He nevertheless affirmed that the show had [...] "positive attributes" [...] that made it enjoyable. Andrew Grossman of The Boston Globe commented that [...] "Brody is instantly likable as Seth" [...] and that Barton [...] "does a nice job with Marissa's torn-between-two-worlds angst", but stated that Ryan [...] "doesn't seem to have many clear personality traits". Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle called the episode [...] "superb" [...] and described McKenzie as [...] "essentially playing James Dean". He compared the actor to Russell Crowe and noted that McKenzie [...] "pull the whole thing off with aplomb".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} David Robert Jones is {{a reference}} to English musician David Bowie, who was born with that name. [...] "In Which We Meet Mr. Jones" [...] was the first appearance of the character. When actor Jared Harris was first cast for the part, he was told Jones was [...] "possibly a major, important character", {{as indicated by the}} episode's title. Whether his character would make a reappearance later in the season depended on how well received Jones was by the show's audience, Harris' performance, and if the writers felt they had more to tell about the character. [...] Harris later described Jones in a May 2009 interview, [...] "I think you could sense that there was a great bit of ambiguity about the character which was useful. He's a bad guy that might be on the right side. He <b>just</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> fighting for the good guys. Those guys are always great parts because you leave the audience guessing about what side he's really on. He's one of those guys that if he's fighting for the right cause, he's a tremendous ally. But if he's fighting on the wrong cause, he's a formidable opponent. He's an anti-hero who is fighting for the just cause". Harris asserted in a February 2009 interview that he did not sign a recurring contract, meaning that the character was not meant to be permanent. He affirmed this by believing the character's personality rendered Jones incapable of joining the regular cast, [...] "You'd have to keep [...] chained like a dog. You couldn't let him loose. You certainly couldn't let him use his hands. You know what the f--k he'd do".|$|E

Children's Literature, which commended the book's fast pace and humor, wrote, [...] "Readers will relate to good natured Percy, the protagonist." [...] Kirkus Reviews awarded it a starred review with, [...] "This third in the Olympians series makes the Greek myths come alive in a way no dreary classroom unit can... will have readers wondering how literature can be this fun. This can stand alone, though newcomers to the series will race {{back to the first}} two volumes and eagerly await a fourth installment." [...] School Library Journal praised the [...] "adventurous" [...] plot as well as the book's appeal: [...] "Teachers will cheer for Percy Jackson and the Olympians as they inspire students to embrace Greek mythology and score the ultimate Herculean challenge: getting kids to read. All in all, a winner of Olympic proportions and a surefire read-aloud." [...] Booklist's starred review approved of the novel's humor action, and plotting: [...] "The Percy Jackson & the Olympians series is built around a terrific idea—that the half-mortal offspring of Greek gods live among us, playing out struggles of mythic scale—and Riordan takes it from strength to strength with this exciting installment, adding even more depth to the characters and story arc while retaining its predecessors' nonstop laughs and action." [...] Kidsreads raved, [...] "Rick Riordan's Olympian adventures have gained great popularity thanks to their combination of humor, adventure and a winning hero ...

[...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that <b>just</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. It’s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical. And I think a lot of people are like that sometimes." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics, with several reviewers dubbing {{it one of}} the worst episodes of the series. Francis Dass of the New Straits Times Press referred to it as [...] "one of the weaker episodes" [...] of the fifth season. The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Schizogeny" [...] a D–, and wrote that [...] "'Schizogeny' <b>just</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> the very worst episode of The X-Files", noting that [...] "the tone [...] is off." [...] Furthermore, VanDerWerff felt that [...] "the more Scott and Wollaeger try to continue explaining this and tie it into the idea of child abuse, the less it attains any of the power or tragedy they want it to have." [...] Starpulse, in a run-down of the best and worst episodes and villains of the series, named the killer trees the worst monster-of-the-week and wrote, [...] " [...] proved that even the X-Files writers can come up completely dry on their scary creeps sometimes." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode 4/10, and, while praising the [...] "interesting concept" [...] of the episode, concluded that it was filled with [...] "odd inconsistencies, [...] is definitely not one of the better episodes of the season." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. [...] The two wrote positively of {{the first part of the}} episode noting that [...] "director Ralph Hemecker [...] the eeriness to the fore, and [...] this a more honest-to-truth scary slice of X-File than has been offered in ages." [...] Shearman and Pearson, however, argued that the episode's references to Psycho and its [...] "lack of explanation" [...] result in the episode approaching [...] "nonsense." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She wrote that, [...] "the plot of 'Schizogeny' is more tangled than the episode's paranormal root system, but underneath lies some powerful themes." ...|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 83, based on 20 reviews. Several writers lauded the lyrical content on the album. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club praised the album, saying that Fiasco [...] "masterfully melds his peerless storytelling gifts with his idiosyncratic passion for skateboarding, fantasy, and incisive sociopolitical commentary". He {{also noted that}} Fiasco [...] "boldly expand the parameters of mainstream hip-hop". Sarah Godfrey of The Washington Post hailed the album as a [...] "masterpiece of responsible rap". Darryl Sterdan of Jam! called the album [...] "one of the sharpest and smartest hip-hop discs" [...] of 2006, while Andy Kellman of AllMusic argued that [...] "Food and Liquor <b>just</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> the steadiest and most compelling rap album of 2006". Stylus Magazines Josh Love felt that it benefits greatly from Fiasco's impressive rapping and subtlety, which he found to be characteristics that are [...] "incredibly rare in hip-hop in 2006". Sean Fennessey of Pitchfork was less enthusiastic and said that although Fiasco's raps are abundant with [...] "wit and double meaning", the album's biggest flaw is his inability to write memorable hooks, which are instead [...] "blandly-sung, unmemorable couplets".|$|E
2500|$|In summer 2006, Brown started hosting The Contrarians, a 30-minute weekly show on CBC Radio One {{devoted to}} {{discussion}} of unpopular {{ideas in the}} Canadian context [...] "that <b>just</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> right". It consisted of Brown championing a controversial argument each episode {{to see if it}} had merit. The topics covered included a thesis that [...] "multiculturalism doesn't work, we just eat each other's sandwiches", a claim that feminism had basically achieved all its goals, a rejection of the widely held view that Canada is a 'good guy' on the global scene, etc. It aired Tuesdays at 9:30a.m. with a repeat the following day at 7:30p.m. The show ended once the new season began in the fall. According to Brown, the CBC brass didn't cancel the show due to being unhappy with its content, but because of catching wind of how difficult its production process was. Brown described his experience on the show as [...] "very difficult" [...] because the management wanted the show to be edgy and really push buttons while the different producers he was being paired with were uncomfortable with the subject matter because it often contradicted their personal convictions. He talked of the show's executive producer Lynda Shorten who simultaneously ran The Sunday Edition facing a near mutiny from her colleagues over the feminism episode and {{the relationship between the two}} souring as a result as he no longer enjoyed her support within the building.|$|E
