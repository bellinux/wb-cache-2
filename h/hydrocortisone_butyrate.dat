40|$|Clobetasone {{butyrate}} {{is a new}} corticosteroid, {{selected for}} study because of its combination of good activity in the vasoconstriction test and low systemic activity in animals. Formulated as an 0. 05 % ointment and cream (Molivate) it was clinically effective in patients with eczema, its activity being significantly {{greater than that of}} hydrocortisone 1 % or fluocortolone 0. 2 % (Ultradil). Under conditions that predispose to maximal percutaneous absorption clobetasone butyrate ointment had minimal effect on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function. In an animal model of cutaneous atrophy it caused less thinning of the epidermis than steroids other than <b>hydrocortisone.</b> Clobetasone <b>butyrate</b> 0. 05 % ointment and cream gave every indication of offering clinically effective topical anti-inflammatory activity with a wide margin of safety...|$|R
40|$|Background: Vehicle-controlled {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment for patients with atopic dermatitis. Objective: This study was undertaken to compare 0. 03 % and 0. 1 % tacrolimus ointment with 0. 1 % hydrocortisone- 17 -butyrate ointment, a midpotent to potent topical corticosteroid, {{in the treatment of}} adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Methods: Patients applied ointment twice daily to all affected areas for 3 weeks in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. The primary endpoint was the modified eczema area and severity index (mEASI) mean area under the curve as a percentage of baseline. Results: Five hundred seventy patients were randomized and received treatment. Discontinuations included 22 of 193 patients from the 0. 03 % tacrolimus group, 22 of 191 patients from the 0. 1 % tacrolimus group, and 17 of 186 patients from the <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>butyrate</b> group. The median mEASI mean area under the curve as a percentage of baseline was 47. 0 %, 36. 5 %, and 36. 1 % for patients who received 0. 03 % tacrolimus, 0. 1 % tacrolimus, and 0. 1 % <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>butyrate,</b> respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between 0. 1 % tacrolimus and 0. 1 % hydrocortisone butyrate; however, the lower improvement in mEASI for 0. 03 % tacrolimus was statistically significant when compared with 0. 1 % tacrolimus (P <. 001) or <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>butyrate</b> (P =. 002). Skin burning and pruritus at the application site showed a higher incidence in the tacrolimus treatment groups than in the <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>butyrate</b> group (P <. 05). Laboratory parameters showed no treatment differences and no marked changes over time. Conclusions: The efficacy of 0. 1 % tacrolimus ointment was similar to that of 0. 1 % <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>butyrate</b> ointment and was lower for 0. 03 % tacrolimus ointment. No serious safety concerns were identified...|$|E
40|$|A valid {{approach}} to treating frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA), a scarring alopecia, {{does not yet}} exist. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the efficacy of a topical application composed of minoxidil, <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>butyrate,</b> 17 α-estradiol, ciclosilicone pentamer, and alcohol in women affected by FFA. Forty women affected by FFA were treated with 2 ml of a topical lotion composed of 2 % minoxidil base, 0. 08 % <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>butyrate,</b> 0. 05 % 17 α-estradiol, 16 % ciclosilicone pentamer, 96 ° alcohol, applied once a day on the scalp. A score index, based on the comparison of the photos, taken at the beginning (T 0) and after 36 months (T 36), was used. The topical lotion led to an improvement in 20 patients, stabilization in 15 patients and worsening of the clinical condition in 5 women.

40|$|Alclometasone dipropionate cream 0 · 05 % was {{compared}} to <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>butyrate</b> cream 0 · 1 % in the treatment ofatopic dermatitis inforty children, 5 to II years old. In this double-blind, parallel-group trial, the experimental creams were applied twice daily for 2 weeks, without occlusion, to the study areas. Efficacy was evaluated I and 2 weeks after the start oftreatment. Both creams were effective treatments for atopic dermatitis; however, alclometasone dipropionate was judged slightly more efficacious. Improvement in erythema, induration, and pruritus averaged 76 % for alclo-metasone dipropionate-treated patients and 70 %for hydrocortisone butyrate-treated patients. At the end of treatment, the physician's global evaluation indicated nineteen of twenty patients in the alclometasone dipropionate group had between 51 % and 100 % improvement in disease signs and symptoms, compared with sixteen of twenty patients treated with <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>butyrate.</b> Two patients in the alclometasone dipropionate-treated group {{and one in the}} hydrocortisone butyrate-treated group reported mild stinging...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Contact {{hypersensitivity}} to corticosteroids {{is increasingly}} reported {{and has been}} identified as a problem of considerable clinical relevance. The prevalence of positive patch tests to corticosteroids ranges from 0. 2 up to 5 %. OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of positive patch tests to corticosteroids in Switzerland was determined in a multi-centre study of patients undergoing routine patch tests. METHODS: As representatives of corticosteroid groups, the following substances were used for screening: tixocortol pivalate and hydrocortisone for group A (hydrocortisone type), <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>butyrate</b> for group D (<b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>butyrate</b> type) and budesonide for both groups B (triamcinolone type) and D. Patients positive for at least one corticosteroid were retested with the screening series and 12 corticosteroids commonly used in Switzerland. RESULTS: Among 3, 016 consecutive patients, 65 individuals (2. 2 %) with a total of 106 positive reactions were found. Retesting showed a concordance of 70 - 98 %, depending on the corticosteroid and the score of the positive reaction. In the subsequently tested corticosteroid series including 12 substances, 19 out of 56 screening-positive patients had a positive result to one or several corticosteroids. There were only few evident cross-reactive patterns in between the corticosteroids tested. CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids should be included in routine patch testing, because contact sensitization to a corticosteroid is of considerable practical importance. We confirm that as markers of corticosteroid sensitization tixocortol pivalate, budesonide and <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>butyrate</b> may be suited, because there is no single corticosteroid which is a marker for all four corticosteroid groups. Patch test reactions of 2 + or higher have a better reproducibility than 1 + reactions...|$|E

40|$|Corticosteroid-induced dermal atrophy {{has been}} studied in the rat using daily {{application}} of ethanolic solutions to small areas of flank skin. After 12 days of treatment, the degree of atrophy was determined by comparing the weights of skin plugs (16 mm diameter) taken from the treated areas with contralaterally paired control areas. Doses can be adjusted so that systemic effects are minimized and only local effects are observed. Hydrocortisone, <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>butyrate,</b> dexamethasone, betamethasone, desonide and triamcinolone acetonide all produce atrophy in the rat, {{and the degree of}} thinning is dose dependent. Potencies in the dermal atrophy assay compare directly with topical anti-inflammatory potencies in the rat, and the presence of fluorine in the steroid molecule is not a determining factor in the production of atrophy...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} reproducibility {{of water and}} ethanol drop volumes from plastic squeeze dropper bottles, examines the difference in drop volumes between commonly used liquid patch test solutions, and evaluates the volumes of water and ethanol needed to saturate Finn and IQ Chamber filter papers. 2 plastic squeeze dropper bottles recommended for use in patch testing have poor reproducibility compared to other bottles tested. 3 aqueous allergens tested (formaldehyde 1 %, methylchloroisothiazolinone/methylisothiazolinone 0. 01 %, and dimethylol dihydroxyethyleneurea 4. 5 %) have drop volumes equivalent to water. Smaller drop volumes are produced by ethanol, <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>butyrate</b> 1 % in ethanol, cocamidopropyl betaine 1 % aq., and propylene glycol 30 % aq. Filter paper saturation volumes using distilled water are 16 - 19 muL in standard Finn Chambers and 29 - 35 muL in IQ Chambers. Ethanol saturation volumes are slightly lower. Previously recommended volumes of application for aqueous allergens of 15 muL for standard Finn Chambers and 25 muL for IQ Chambers (slightly below the filter paper saturation points) are appropriate. Selection of dropper bottles should consider drop volume reproducibility, differing drop volumes for different allergens, and the patch test chamber system being used...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids {{may cause}} {{immediate}} or delayed hypersensitivity. In 1989, based on structural and clinical characteristics, we {{put forward a}} classification of corticosteroids into four cross-reacting groups, namely group A, B, C, and D, the latter later subdivided into two subgroups, i. e. D 1 and D 2. The constituents on the D-ring of the corticosteroid-molecule are considered to have a central role for binding to skin proteins and for cross-reactions patterns; however, halogenation of the molecules is also interfering. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical data and analyse simultaneous positive reactions obtained in {{a large group of}} corticosteroid-allergic patients. METHODS: Patch tests were performed with the baseline series, to which <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>butyrate</b> and prednisolone caproate were added, {{as well as with the}} corticosteroids to which the patients had been exposed. Three hundred and forty subjects with a presumed or proven corticosteroid allergy were further investigated with an extended series containing 72 molecules. RESULTS: Out of 11 596 patients investigated, 315 subjects reacted positively to at least 1 corticosteroid-molecule, with most of them presenting with multiple positive reactions. CONCLUSION: A prevalence of corticosteroid allergy of 2. 7 % was found. Despite validity of the ABCD (sub) classification in many cases, possible adjustments may have to be considered...|$|E
40|$|A novel approach, cosurfactants ultrasonic-thermostatic-assisted {{cloud point}} {{extraction}} (CUS-CPE) combined with high performance liquid chromatography and ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) is {{developed for the}} analysis of glucocorticoids (beclometasone dipropionate (BD), <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>butyrate</b> (HB) and nandrolone phenylpropionate (NPP)) in human urine samples. In this study, four different cloud point extraction (CPE) systems are discussed, including DC- 193 -nonanoic acid, DC- 193 -sodium sulfate, DC- 193 -lauric acid and the classic Triton X- 100 sulfate systems. Among them, DC- 193 -sodium sulfate and the classic Triton X- 100 sulfate systems has been studied in the past few years. Comparing with the first two systems, DC- 193 -nonanoic acid system had a lower cloud point (CP), little UV absorbance and it is less damaging to the column of three glucocorticoids in same surfactant concentration which was required for application as a pre-concentration process prior to HPLC. Phase diagrams were used to study the cavitation and mass transfer behaviors of the two phases on micelles of polyether type organic silicon surfactant, PEG- 12 dimethicone (DC- 193). The volumes of surfactant-rich phase obtained were very small (the enrichment factor (EF) was 35), which was much smaller and had a quick phase separating speed than that of Triton X- 100 in the same surfactant concentration. Linearity was investigated from 1 to 350 ng mL- 1. The limits of detection (LOD) thus estimated were 1. 29 for BD, 2. 67 for HB and 3. 33 ng mL- 1 for NPP, respectively. In proposed CPE step is rapid and effective to obtain recovery of three glucocorticoids higher than 85 %, which is similar or better than literature reported data. The method was shown to be selective, linear, precise and reproducible and successfully applied {{for the analysis of}} glucocorticoids in human urine samples...|$|E
40|$|Background: Concern {{exists that}} the {{prolonged}} application of immunomodulators to treat atopic dermatitis may cause systemic immunosuppression. Aims: In a 7 -month, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial, we investigated the equivalence {{of response to}} vaccination against meningococcal serogroup C disease with a protein-conjugate vaccine in children (2 – 11 years) with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, by applying either 0. 03 % tacrolimus ointment (TAC-O; n = 21) or a hydrocortisone ointment regimen (HC-O; n = 111). Methods: TAC-O was applied twice daily (bid) for 3 weeks, and thereafter daily until clearance. 1 % hydrocortisone acetate (HA) for head/neck and 0. 1 % <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>butyrate</b> ointment for trunk/limbs was applied bid for 2 weeks; thereafter HA was applied bid to all affected areas. At week 1, patients were vaccinated with protein-conjugate vaccine against meningococcal serogroup C, and challenged at month 6 with low dose meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. The control group (44 non-atopic dermatatits children) received the primary vaccination and challenge dose. Assessments were made at baseline, weeks 1 and 5, and months 6 and 7. The primary end point was the percentage of patients with a serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) titre 8 at the week 5 visit. Results: The response rate (patients with SBA titre 8) was 97. 5 % (confidence interval (CI) approximately 97. 3 to 100), 99. 1 % (94. 8 to 100) and 97. 7 % (93. 3 to 100) in the TAC-O, HC-O and control groups, respectively. Conclusions: The immune response to vaccination against meningococcal serogroup C in children with atopic dermatitis applying either 0. 03 % TAC-O or HC is equivalent. Ointment application {{does not affect the}} immediate response to vaccination, generation of immune memory or humoral and cell-mediated immunity.

40|$|Background Atopic dermatis (AD) is {{a chronic}} disease that often {{requires}} long-term treatment. Topical corticosteroids are the usual therapy {{for patients with}} AD, but prolonged usage can result in skin atrophy and other side-effects. Objectives In a randomized, double-blind, comparative study, to compare the efficacy and safety of a 6 -month treatment period with 0. 1 % tacrolimus ointment vs. a corticosteroid ointment regimen in adults with moderate to severe AD. Methods Treatment was applied twice daily for a maximum of 6 months. Patients in the tacrolimus treatment group (n = 487) applied 0. 1 % tacrolimus ointment to all affected areas over the whole body. The patients treated with the corticosteroid regimen (n = 485) applied 0. 1 % <b>hydrocortisone</b> <b>butyrate</b> ointment to affected areas on the trunk and extremities and 1 % hydrocortisone acetate ointment to affected areas on the face and neck. The study primary endpoint was the response rate, i. e. the proportion of patients with at least 60 % improvement in the modified Eczema Area and Severity Index (mEASI) between baseline and month 3. Results By month 3, more patients in the 0. 1 % tacrolimus group responded to treatment (72. 6 % vs. 52. 3 % in the corticosteroid group, P < 0. 001). The patients treated with 0. 1 % tacrolimus also showed greater improvement in mEASI, EASI, affected body surface area and physician and patient assessments of global response. Patients applying 0. 1 % tacrolimus ointment experienced more skin burning (52. 4 % vs. 13. 8 % in the corticosteroid group; P < 0. 001). In most patients, skin burning was mild to moderate in severity and decreased rapidly after {{the first week of}} treatment. There was no increase in the incidence of infections or malignancies over time in either treatment group. Conclusions Long-term treatment with 0. 1 % tacrolimus ointment is significantly more efficacious than a corticosteroid ointment regimen in adults with moderate to severe A...|$|E
