The <b>gaseous</b> <b>fluoride</b> and SO 2 concentrations in air of outdoor environment, kitchen and traditional flue-curing barn were determined in 56 households in coal-burning endemic fluorosis areas of Zhaotong. Among these, 21 households in Yujiawan Village, Zhenxiong County, Zhaotong City were chosen for this experiment to reduce <b>gaseous</b> <b>fluoride</b> and SO 2 concentration in traditional flue-curing barn air by using calcined dolomitic siliceous limestone (CDSL) instead of clay mixed with coal.

(4) After using the calcined dolomitic siliceous limestone instead of clay mixed with coal, <b>gaseous</b> <b>fluoride</b> and SO 2 concentration in the traditional flue-curing barn air decreased of 45 % and 91 %, respectively.
