5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E
5|$|Just before NBA {{training}} camp opened following {{the resolution of}} the 2011 NBA lockout, Roy announced that <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> had degenerated so much—he lacked cartilage between the bones of both knees—that he was retiring from basketball.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} oil {{study for the}} {{defeated}} warrior (York Art Gallery), Etty gave the character a more defiant appearance than seen in the finished version. In this preliminary sketch he is not on <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> but thrusts his leg out to brace himself. He has an expression of defiance and determination, rather than the plea for mercy and posture of total defeat shown in the final work.|$|E
50|$|Cruz {{retired in}} 1964 after he reinjured <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> which he {{suffered}} in the Admirals game against Crispa where he {{fell to the floor}} during an undergoal play and broke <b>his</b> <b>knee.</b>|$|R

50|$|Welborne was {{selected}} by the Minnesota Vikings in the seventh round (180th pick) of the 1991 NFL Draft. He had been expected to be drafted in {{the second or third}} round, but fell in the draft after injuring <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> and undergoing reconstructive surgery. He missed the 1991 NFL season while rehabilitating <b>his</b> <b>knee,</b> but signed a contract with the Vikings in April 1992 that was contingent on Welborne passing a physical examination on <b>his</b> <b>knee.</b> Welborne appeared in two games for the Vikings during the 1992 season. He tore the ACL in <b>his</b> left <b>knee</b> during a game against the Detroit Lions, ending his 1991 season. He attempted a comeback in 1992, but injured <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> again, and <b>his</b> playing career was over.|$|R
5|$|Luongo {{plays in}} the {{butterfly}} style of goaltending, dropping to <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> with his skates pointing outwards and his pads meeting in the middle in order to cover the bottom portion of the net. Due to the style of play, groin injuries are common for butterfly goalies. Luongo suffered one during the 2008–09 season and missed 24 games.|$|E
5|$|Mamie Till Bradley {{testified that}} she had {{instructed}} her son to watch his manners in Mississippi and that should a situation ever come to his being asked to get on <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> to ask forgiveness of a white person, he should do it without a thought. The defense questioned her identification of her son in the casket in Chicago and a $400 life insurance policy she had taken out on him.|$|E
5|$|Olmstead won {{two more}} Stanley Cups in the 1956–57 and 1957–58 seasons. After the {{conclusion}} of the 1957–58 seasons, doctors informed him that he had no strength left in <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> and that he should contemplate retirement. As a result of this prognosis, the Canadiens left Olmstead unprotected in the Intra-League Draft, and he was claimed by Billy Reay, the head coach of the Canadiens' chief rival, the Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E
50|$|In {{the third}} preseason {{game against the}} New England Patriots in 2012, Joseph hurt <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> when {{teammate}} Donald Penn blocked defensive end Chandler Jones into <b>his</b> <b>knee.</b> Joseph was later placed on injured reserve, ending his season.|$|R

25|$|During the offseason, Gordon {{admitted}} that he faced lingering problems with <b>his</b> <b>knee.</b> Microfracture surgery was reportedly proposed as a solution, but in early November, Gordon received a second opinion from a doctor in Chicago, who prescribed continued rehab for <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> and estimated that Gordon would miss 4–6 weeks. On November 7, 2012, Gordon was sent to Los Angeles to get more personalized rehabilitation work to help in <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> recovery and to strengthen his quad muscles.|$|R
5|$|On December 22, People {{magazine}} {{reported that}} Tyler had entered a rehabilitation facility to manage his addiction to painkillers, {{brought on by}} injuries to <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> legs, and feet, that resulted from years of performing.

5|$|Though McBride {{ran with}} {{impressive}} speed, {{more than half}} of his 11 MLB seasons were significantly shortened due to injury or illness. He had surgeries on both of <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> during his playing career, and he missed almost all of the 1982 season with an eye infection related to his use of contact lenses. After his playing career ended, McBride was a minor league coach for the New York Mets and the St. Louis Cardinals.|$|E
5|$|Warren Jeffs' prison {{life has}} been tumultuous. At Utah's Purgatory Correctional Facility, he {{suffered}} from infected ulcers on <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> which resulted from praying days on end during solitary confinement. He attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself at one point. In August 2008, Jeffs went into convulsions after banging {{his head against the}} walls of his cell repetitively and had to be taken to a hospital by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} {{version of}} Troilus' death appears on a red-figure cup by Oltos. Troilus is on <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> {{still in the}} process of drawing his sword when Achilles' spear has already stabbed him and Aeneas comes too late to save him. Troilus wears a helmet, but it is pushed up to reveal a beautiful young face. This is the only such depiction of Troilus' death in early figurative art. However, this version of Troilus as a youth defeated in battle appears also in written sources.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with <b>his</b> <b>knees.</b> He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
5|$|Despite his numbers, rumors were {{swirling}} {{about his}} weight {{and its effect}} on <b>his</b> <b>knees</b> and his request for a trade out of Chicago. On December 8, Smith, the team's career leader in saves, was traded to the Boston Red Sox for pitchers Al Nipper and Calvin Schiraldi. Nipper pitched only 104 more innings in the majors, and Schiraldi was out of baseball before age 30. Smith, meanwhile, registered nearly 300 saves after the trade. The trade started Smith on a journey involving seven teams in eight seasons, which may have hurt his chances in the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Gertrude summons Hamlet to {{her room}} to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about the impossibility of repenting, since he still has {{possession}} of his ill-gotten goods: his brother's crown and wife. He sinks to <b>his</b> <b>knees.</b> Hamlet, {{on his way to}} visit his mother, sneaks up behind him, but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send him straight to heaven while his father's ghost is stuck in purgatory. In the queen's bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind a tapestry, makes a noise.|$|E

Roy reportedly had expressed interest in signing with the Dallas Mavericks, Golden State Warriors, Minnesota Timberwolves, Indiana Pacers, or Chicago Bulls.|$|E
