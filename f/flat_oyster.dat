40|$|A diving {{survey and}} {{systematic}} sampling of live populations of <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> {{was done at}} 5 locations on the south coast of NSW. These were Merimbula Lake, Pambula Lake, the Bermagui River estuary, Wagonga Inlet at Narooma and the Clyde River estuary at Batemans Bay. At all locations live <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> were found on hard substrates projecting above sand, silt or mud sediments or on other vertical substrates especially oyster lease posts and rail structures, jetty piles, natural rocky outcrops and boulders of breakwaters near the mouths of these estuaries. The great majority of live <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> collected occurred within a sub-tidal depth band spanning 1 to 4 m below the low water mark. A total of 474 oysters ranging from 80 to 120 mm were collected from the 5 locations.

40|$|An in situ {{study of}} growth and {{survival}} rates of <b>flat</b> (native) <b>oysters</b> (Ostrea angasi) was conducted on beds of oysters in Georges Bay, Northeast Tasmania, from February 1994 –February 1995. Shell length and whole weight of three size groups of tagged <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> were measured at 1 – 3 month intervals at three sites. Mean increase in shell length ranged from 7 to 28 mm and live weight from 40. 3 to 47. 0 g for large to small oysters, respectively. Significant differences were shown in the increase in shell length and live weight between sites and size classes. Instantaneous mortality rates were variable between sites and sizes with percentage mortality ranging from 6. 43 % to 22. 95 %. The data were also analysed using Fabens parameterisation of the von Bertalanffy growth equation for tag recapture data. Growth curves generated were significantly different with calculated L∞ and k values ranging from 103. 5 to 118. 8 mm and 0. 560 to 0. 661 year− 1, respectively.

50|$|Marteilia refringens is a {{unicellular}} parasite {{affecting the}} digestive {{system of the}} <b>flat</b> <b>oyster,</b> Ostrea edulis. Other species that can be infected include the Australian mud oyster (O. angasi), the Argentinean oyster (O. puelchana), the Chilean <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> (O. chilensis), the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and the Mediterranean mussel (M. galloprovincialis). Early stages {{of the life cycle}} occur in the epithelia of the digestive ducts and possibly the gills of the host. Later the parasite migrates to the epithelial cells of the digestive tubules. There may be no symptoms of infection. The factors triggering a pathogenic response are unclear but may be related to environmental stress. The gross signs of marteiliosis include the visceral tissues losing their pigmentation and becoming pale yellow. In some cases the mantle become translucent and shell growth may cease. Affected shellfish can become emaciated and in heavy infections tissues appear shrunken and slimy. Mortality seems {{to be related to the}} sporulation of the parasite. The parasite was first observed in France in 1979 and has since spread to other countries in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Selection {{for live}} weight of Pacific oysters showed {{improvements}} ranging from 0.4% to 25.6% {{compared to the}} wild stock. Sydney-rock oysters (Saccostrea commercialis) showed a 4% increase after one generation and a 15% increase after two generations. Chilean oysters (Ostrea chilensis), selected for improvement in live weight and shell length showed a 10-13% gain in one generation.Bonamia ostrea is a protistan parasite that causes catastrophic losses (nearly 98%) in European <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> Ostrea edulis L. This protistan parasite is endemic to three oyster-regions in Europe. Selective breeding programs show that O. edulis susceptibility to the infection differs across oyster strains in Europe. A study carried out by Culloty et al. showed that ‘Rossmore' oysters in Cork harbour, Ireland had better resistance compared to other Irish strains. A selective breeding program at Cork harbour uses broodstock from 3- to 4-year-old survivors and is further controlled until a viable percentage reaches market size. Over the years ‘Rossmore' oysters have shown to develop lower prevalence of B. ostreae infection and percentage mortality.Ragone Calvo et al. (2003) selectively bred the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, for resistance against co-occurring parasites Haplosporidium nelson (MSX) and Perkinsus marinus (Dermo). They achieved dual resistance to the disease in four generations of selective breeding. The oysters showed higher growth and survival rates and low susceptibility to the infections. At {{the end of the}} experiment, artificially selected C. virginica showed a 34-48% higher survival rate.|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate consumer preferences for these two oyster species and to determine the sensory properties of both species by consumers. Two-alternative forced choice tests were performed with the oysters involving a panel of 74 naïve consumers. No significant differences in preferences between the oyster species were observed by the consumers. Nine sensory attributes of both oyster species were evaluated. Consumers did not observe significant differences between species in the sensory attributes: overall odor intensity, sea odor, mud odor, sweetness, pungency, and firmness.

40|$|Suspended culture {{system is}} a new method to produce <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> (Ostrea edulis Linneo 1758) into the open sea in Italian coast. 150 long-line cultured <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> were tested {{respectively}} in July and December 1997 {{for the presence of}} Bonamia ostreae. The oyster farming is located 5 miles offshore in the east of Porto Levante (North-East Italy) in 25 metres of water. The lanterns are suspended 12 - 15 meters up from the bottom. The stocking density is 30 specimens per tray (300 specimens per lantern). The total stock is 100. 000 molluscs for a two year cycle of production. Oysters mortality during 1996 has been relatively low (10 %). In 1997 the mortality reached 60 % due to an algal bloom. During sampling 84 % of the oysters examined presented wide burrows repleted with muddy debris on the inner surface of both valves. Polychaetes (Anellida) were detected inside the burrows belonging to five families: Terebellidae, Serpulidae, Syllidae, Nereidae, Eunicidae. In particular the following Taxa were identified: Syllis sp., Nereis sp., Nereis caudata and Eunice pennata. Examination with a binocular microscope revealed the holes of Anellida's penetration on the shell's outer surface. The impacts of these worms on molluscs are variable but the most damaging form of infestation results from boring action and the subsequent formation of mudblisters.

40|$|Apoptosis is a {{fundamental}} feature {{in the development of}} many organisms and tissue systems. It is also a mechanism of host defense against environmental stress factors or pathogens by contributing to the elimination of infected cells. Hemocytes {{play a key role in}} defense mechanisms in invertebrates and previous studies have shown that physical or chemical stress can increase apoptosis in hemocytes in mollusks. However this phenomenon has rarely been investigated in bivalves especially in the <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> Ostrea edulis. The apoptotic response of hemocytes from flat oysters, O. edulis, was investigated after exposure to UV and dexamethasone, two agents known to induce apoptosis in vertebrates. Flow cytometry and microscopy were combined to demonstrate that apoptosis occurs in <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> hemocytes. Investigated parameters like intracytoplasmic calcium activity, mitochondrial membrane potential and phosphatidyl-serine externalization were significantly modulated in cells exposed to UV whereas dexamethasone only induced an increase of DNA fragmentation.

Prevalence was greatest in the largest oysters and was higher in spring than in the autumn, perhaps because of the mortality of these shellfish during the summer. Mortality seemed to be correlated with higher water temperatures and oysters seemed to be more susceptible to infection after seasons with lower food availability or lower salinity levels.|$|R

40|$|Bonamia exitiosa and Bonamia ostreae are parasites that {{reproduce}} {{within the}} haemocytes of several oyster species. In Europe, the host species is the <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> Ostrea edulis.

B. exitiosa was first detected, in 2007, on this continent in flat oysters cultured in Galicia (NW Spain). Since then, the parasite has also been detected in France, Italy and the United Kingdom. The bays of the Ebro Delta in the south of Catalonia represent the main bivalve culture area in the Mediterranean coast of Spain.
