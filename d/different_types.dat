5|$|A test in 1997 {{showed that}} P. fimbriata′s {{preferences}} for <b>different</b> <b>types</b> of prey {{are in the}} order: web spiders; jumping spiders; and insects. These preferences apply to both live prey and motionless lures, and to P. fimbriata specimens without prey for 7days ("well-fed") and without prey for 14days ("starved"). P. fimbriata specimens without prey for 21days ("extra-starved") showed no preference for <b>different</b> <b>types</b> of prey. The test included as prey several species of web spiders and jumping spiders, and {{the selection of the}} prey species showed no evidence of affecting the results.

5|$|Antibodies are glycoproteins {{belonging}} to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They constitute most of the gamma globulin fraction of the blood proteins. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several <b>different</b> <b>types</b> of antibody heavy chains that define the five <b>different</b> <b>types</b> of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may {{be attached to the}} antigen-binding fragments. The five <b>different</b> <b>types</b> of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five isotypes. Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific Fc Receptor (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds. The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region. The ability of antibodies to bind to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. For example, IgE is responsible for an allergic response consisting of mast cell degranulation and histamine release. IgE's Fab paratope binds to allergic antigen, for example house dust mite particles, while its Fc region binds to Fc receptor ε. The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.|$|E

5|$|Antibody genes also re-organize in {{a process}} called class {{switching}} that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region.
