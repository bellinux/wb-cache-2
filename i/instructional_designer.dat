40|$|This study {{examined}} how the personal characteristics of <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> influenced their current instructional-design practice (ID). I first {{looked at the}} instructional designers’ perceptions {{of the relationship between}} their personal characteristics and their ID practice. I then looked at how these variables were used by the designers to influence their ID practice. The study was guided by the following questions: What specific personal characteristics <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> perceive as being an important influence on their ID practice? How do <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> use specific personal characteristics to influence their ID practice? How do <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> use specific personal characteristics to diversify their ID practice? Specific personal characteristics included personal attributes such as age, and experiences, including prior work experiences. Personal characteristics were informed by the literature, the pilot study, and personal experiences. This qualitative research study used interviews as the primary source for data collection. The theoretical framework was symbolic interactionism. A pilot study was used to test and fine-tune the research data-collection methods and analysis. A snowball sampling technique yielded 15 <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> working in a higher education setting in the United States. I included <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> who did not receive formal training in ID but who obtained the necessary skills to perform the job through experience. The data analysis followed the guidelines proposed by Miles and Huberman, Kvale and Brinkmann, Roulston, and Rubin and Rubin. Findings showed that <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> perceived that specific personal characteristics such as (a) gender, (b) age, (c) key people, (d) spirituality, (e) philosophy, (f) formative years, and experiences such as (a) education—student experiences in the classroom, and program preparation, and (b) work experiences—prior work experiences, and ID professional work experiences influenced their ID practice. These personal characteristics influenced the designers ID practice by adding a secondary perspective through their cultural and biological influences, and by directly informing their approach to process through educational and work experiences. Study results showed that specific personal characteristics and experience allow <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> to alter their current ID practice, thereby transforming a once-homogeneous process to a heterogeneous one...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Instructional</b> <b>designers</b> may guide learner {{attention}} by introducing learners to carefully selected objects {{and events that}} occur in certain environments. In some situations, {{it is not possible}} to have learners work with real objects, events, or environments. In these cases, <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> may create representations of the objects, events, or environments. These representations are called models. A model is a definition or representation of an object, event, or environment that includes some information regarding their properties, actions, or cause-effect relationships. <b>Instructional</b> <b>designers</b> may use a variety of models to help learners construct their own mental models. A model can take various mediated forms, from simple textual descriptions to complex, multimedia simulations.|$|R
40|$|Developing modern {{instructional}} software {{has become}} very complex. As a result, the communication between <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> and other stakeholders in the development process is becoming increasingly important. However, {{due to differences in}} background, focus, and tools among ISD stakeholders <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> lack the means to provide reasonably unequivocal design documentation for these stakeholders. These differences in stakeholders create a context where the design documents produced are not sufficiently related to the specific needs of the stakeholders, in terms of meaningful organization and differentiation of level of detail. This problem is complicated by the lack of shared design languages. These problems prevent precise expression of design information. The 3 D-model is introduced to support <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> to stratify, elaborate, and formalize design documents, even if design languages are hardly shared between designers and other stakeholders. Two validation studies show that the 3 D-model contributes to a better information transition between <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> and software producers-one of the stakeholders in the development process...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} project takes a comprehensive {{look at the}} intricate issue of multicultural instruction {{within the field of}} instructional design, and challenges faced by <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> on meeting the needs of learners who come from cultures different from their own. The study explores issues of cultural differences that are most likely to impact instructional situations and indirectly influence future <b>instructional</b> <b>designer’s</b> work. The implication that, <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> who are unaware of cultural differences and the impact it might have on learners and their beliefs regarding cultural issues, highlights the importance of examining the experiences of professionals who have been involved with such efforts. In order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the ways in which issues of culture persist in our education system, a qualitative applied approach emphasizing critical pedagogy is used to evaluate how inequitable power relations are perpetuated and how <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> respond to ethnic student populations. This design examines the experiences of 12 <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> and suggests that cultural issues and the delivery of instruction cross-culturally are far more complex than has been recognized in the literature on instructional teaching and learning. The findings from this study have implications for both students and faculty members encompassing issues such as epistemological beliefs, lack of awareness, and social relationships that suggests cultural parameters that hinder the expansion of multicultural contexts in teaching and learning. The study also provides valuable insight into exploring the cultural competence of these participants while providing several recommendations for <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> and future research. This analysis offers great insight into the impact instructional providers have on the outcomes of education and notes the differences that exist in making a contribution to the education of diverse learners...|$|R

40|$|Experienced {{instructional}} design practitioners {{often use}} personal rules of thumb (heuristics) when {{engaged in the}} instructional design problem-solving process. It could be beneficial for novices to know which heuristics experienced <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> use as one way to make their problem-solving processes more efficient. Thus, this two-phase study investigated instructional design heuristics used by experienced <b>instructional</b> <b>designers.</b> Phase A included interviews with experienced <b>instructional</b> <b>designers,</b> during which each participant told {{a story about a}} complex instructional design project on which he/she had worked. From these stories we extracted a set of heuristics that guided their practice. In Phase B, Delphi surveys were conducted with a panel of experienced <b>instructional</b> <b>designers,</b> which allowed for corroboration and consensus of the heuristics found in Phase A. ^ Interviews resulted in 8 categories of heuristics. Categories included communication, management, learner/audience, solutions/deliverables/outcomes, design process, design team, design problem, and client. Within each category multiple heuristics were identified. The Delphi process resulted in 61 instructional design heuristics classified into the same eight categories. Within each category, multiple heuristics were again identified and also rank-ordered based on the calculated mean of each heuristic’s ratings. ^ Discussion centers on the incorporation of heuristics in novice instructional design education. Because instructional design is a problem-solving process, novices need to understand what practicing <b>instructional</b> <b>designers</b> do, rather than just memorizing procedures in instructional design models. Based on the results of this study, instructional design educators should consider teaching business, project management, and communication skills (in addition to the basic ID skills), which most instructional design models fail to include. ...|$|R
