50|$|The {{rectangular}} cross-section fuselage consisted of four spruce Warren girders, fabric covered behind the engine. The cockpit {{was at the}} trailing edge of the wing and behind there was a deep, rounded fabric covered decking. In front of the cockpit the decking was continued in aluminium, enclosing the fuel tank. Forward of this and beyond a firewall, the inverted in-line engine was mounted on a frame of square section steel members. It drove a two bladed metal propeller. Comper was an early adopter of retractable undercarriages for light aircraft {{at a time when the}} balance of advantage between <b>drag</b> <b>loss</b> and weight penalty was not obvious. The main wheels of the Streak were mounted at the end of the wing centre section, each between pairs of compression legs. Pairs of cross braced struts, joining the legs a little way above the axle and hinged at top and bottom, rotated to retract the wheels rearwards. In common with many aircraft of the time, the retracted undercarriage left a part of the wheel exposed, to give some protection in a wheels up landing. The wheels, which had brakes, were retracted manually via a heavily geared down, bicycle chain drive. At the rear there was a simple, sprung tailskid.|$|E

The drag losses considered in this analysis are those due to (1) the extra drag imposed on the airplane by the weight of the intercooler, its duct, and its supports and (2) the drag sustained by the cooling air in flowing through the intercooler and its duct. The investigation covers a range of conditions of altitude, airspeed, lift-drag ratio, supercharger-pressure ratio, and supercharger adiabatic efficiency.

40|$|Of all {{the types}} of drag, induced drag is {{associated}} with the creation and generation of lift over wings. Induced drag is directly driven by the span load that the aircraft is flying at. The tools by which to calculate and predict induced drag we use were created by Ludwig Prandtl in 1903. Within a decade after Prandtl created a tool for calculating induced drag, Prandtl and his students had optimized the problem to solve the minimum induced drag for a wing of a given span, formalized and written about in 1920. This solution is quoted in textbooks extensively today. Prandtl did not stop with this first solution, and came to a dramatically different solution in 1932. Subsequent development of this 1932 solution solves several aeronautics design difficulties simultaneously, including maximum performance, minimum structure, minimum <b>drag</b> <b>loss</b> due to control input, and solution to adverse yaw without a vertical tail.

Reversing the IXB force by employing on-board stored power would drive the tether current against the induced voltage, providing a 1 N thrust for 8 kW of energy consumed, which could be supplied by solar panels during the day portion of orbit.

40|$|The rapidly {{expanding}} civil aerospace sector {{is subjected to}} ever increasing pressure to be both sustainable and competitive. The research reported in the current thesis forms {{a part of the}} significant R&D effort of Rolls-Royce in response to this pressure. A broad based approach is taken to evaluating compressor blade surface finish with the objective of improving manufacturing and operating efficiency. Technical developments made as part of the current work is also intended to support future research in this important field. Compressor blade surface finish is emulated in the lab to detail its topographical development through the critical final polishing stage of processing. Based on existing surface standards a new characteristic developmental pattern and nomenclature is described for this finishing process. In addition, ‘edge shadowing’ a novel surface texture distribution is reported showing mass finishing to be non-uniform over a flat surface. The surface texture of exemplar ’as manufactured’ compressor blades is assessed and a protocol for areal parametric characterisation is developed. The protocol includes consideration of; surface texture homogeneity, local & global sample weighting, sampling efficiency, and key characteristic areal parameters, with their specification levels and confidence intervals. This detailed examination of mass finishing and the surface texture it produces will help improve process control and optimise economy. To improve the ongoing assessment of compressor performance degradation in service, a series of recovered compressor blades are characterised. Predominantly automated techniques are developed to assess compressor blade side and leading edge character. Key trends in surface topography on individual blade surface regions are reported along with broader degradation trends throughout the compressor. Leading edges are shown to be characteristically prone to greater degradation and levels of surface roughness, though elevated leading edge roughness is better correlated with deposits than with erosion. Proper analysis of aerodynamic losses due to aerofoil surface roughness requires the use of techniques with conflicting requirements. Thus in the current context the replication of metallic test aerofoils in thermally insulating resin is required. A method for this replication and its validation are presented. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of <b>drag</b> <b>loss</b> due to surface roughness a series of rough test aerofoil surfaces were parametrically characterised and wind tunnel tested.

40|$|An {{electrodynamic}} tether {{consists of}} a long insulated wire in space whose orbital motion cuts across lines of magnetic flux to produce an induce voltage that in typical low orbits averages about 200 v/km. Such a system should be capable of generating substantial electrical power, {{at the expense of}} IXB drag acting on its orbital energy. If a reverse current is driven against the induced voltage, the system should act as a motor producing IXB thrust. A reference system was designed, capable of generating 20 KW of power into an electrical load located anywhere along the wire at the expense of 2. 6 N (20, 000 J/sec) drag on the wire. In an ideal system, the conversion between mechanical and electrical energy would reach 100 % efficiency. In the actual system part of the 20 KW is lost to internal resistance of the wire, plasma and ionosphere, while the drag force is increased by residual air drag. The 20 KW PMG system as designed is estimated to provide 18. 7 KW net power to the load at total <b>drag</b> <b>loss</b> of 20. 4 KJ/sec, or an overall efficiency of 92 %.

40|$|The work focusses {{on the use}} of {{multidisciplinary}} optimization {{to design}} a cost optimized airborne nanosatellite launch vehicle capable of bringing a 10 kg payload into low earth orbit (LEO). Piggyback or shared launch options currently available for nanosatellites are relatively low cost (~ 45, 000 /kg) but have as serious disadvantage a limited mission flexibility due to a limited range in attainable orbits and the launch schedule being connected to that of its fellow passengers. An alternative option, providing increased mission flexibility, is {{through the use of a}} dedicated launch vehicle, be it at a higher launch cost. An interesting option to limit the increase in launch cost is by air-launch to orbit using an already existing aircraft as carrier vehicle, i. e. first stage. This is considered beneficial especially for small launch vehicles as many potential carrier vehicles are available and because of the relatively high <b>drag</b> <b>loss</b> that is associated with ground-launch to orbit for small launch vehicles. The work presented here addresses the use of multidisciplinary optimization (MDO) methods to the design of solid rocket propelled launch vehicles, thereby taking into account both air- and ground-launch as well as the addition of lifting devices (use of wings). The method combines both vehicle and trajectory design in a sequential approach. Analysis modules included address issues concerning vehicle geometry, aerodynamics, solid rocket propulsion and vehicle mass, size and cost. The tools developed have been used to design a low-cost, solid propelled vehicle that is launched from an F- 16 aircraft. Main design variables are release altitude, -velocity and -flight path angle as well as number of rocket stages, stage thrust and stage burn time. The results show an optimized, three stage launch vehicle that fits within the contours of the F- 16 ’s 370 gallon external fuel tank and with a gross take-off mass that is up to 70 % lower than that of a comparable 10 -kg to LEO ground launched vehicle. The vehicle’s launch costs are estimated at 1. 9 million euro per launch based on a total of 120 launches over a period of 20 years.

40|$|This thesis {{involves}} the experimental testing of a bluff {{body with a}} blunt base {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of end-plate tabs in reducing drag. The bluff body is fitted with interchangeable end plates; one plate is flush with the rest of the exterior and the other plate has small tabs protruding perpendicularly into the flow. The body is tested in the Cal Poly 3 ft x 4 ft low speed wind tunnel. Testing is conducted in three phases. The first phase was the hot-wire measurement of streamwise velocity of the near wake behind the bluff body. An IFA 300 thermal anemometry system with a hot-wire probe placed behind the model measures the wake velocity fluctuations. The power spectral density on the model without tabs shows large spikes at Strouhal numbers of 0. 266, 0. 300, and 0. 287 at corresponding Re = 41, 400, 82, 800, 124, 200 where vortex shedding occurs. The model with tabs shows no such peaks in power and therefore has attenuated vortex generation in the wake flow at that location. The second phase of testing was pressure testing the model through the use of pressure ports on the exterior of the bluff body. A Scanivalve pressure transducer measured multiple ports almost simultaneously through tubing that was connected to the model internally and routed through the model’s strut mount and outside of the wind tunnel. This pressure testing shows that the model with tabs is able to achieve up to 36 % increase in Cp at Reh = 41, 400 on the base region of the bluff body and no negative pressure spikes that occur as a result of vortex shedding. The last phase of testing is the measurement of total drag on the model through a sting balance mount. This testing shows that the drag on the model is reduced by 14 % at Re = 41, 400. However it also shows that as velocity increased, the drag reduction is reduced and ultimately negated at Re = 124, 200 with no <b>drag</b> <b>loss</b> at all. The addition of tabs as a passive flow control device did eliminate vortex shedding and alter the base pressure of the bluff body. This particular model however showed no reduction in total drag on the model at high Reynolds numbers higher than 124, 000. Further study is necessary to isolate the exact geometry and flow velocities that should be able to produce more favorable drag results for a bluff body with this type of passive flow control device...|$|E

40|$|Cycloturbines and cyclorotors are {{established}} concepts for extracting freesteam fluid energy and producing thrust which promise {{to exceed the}} performance of traditional horizontal axis turbines and rotors while maintaining unique operational advantages. However, their potential is not yet realized in widespread applications. A central barrier to their proliferation {{is the lack of}} fundamental understanding of the aerodynamic interaction between the turbine and the freestream flow. In particular, blade pitch must be precisely actuated throughout the revolution to achieve the proper blade angle of attack and maximize performance. So far, there is no adequate method for determining or implementing the optimal blade pitching kinematics for cyclorotors or cycloturbines. This dissertation bridges the pitching deficiency by introducing a novel low order model to predict improved pitch kinematics, experimentally demonstrating improved performance, and evaluating flow physics with a high order Navier-Stokes computational code. ^ The foundation for developing advanced blade pitch motions is a low order model named Fluxline Theory. Fluid calculations are performed in a coordinate system fixed to streamlines whose spatial locations are not pre-described in order to capture the flow expansion/contraction and bending through the turbine. A transformation then determines the spatial location of streamlines through the rotor disk and finally blade element method integrations determine the power and forces produced. Validation against three sets of extant cycloturbine experimental data demonstrates improvement over other existing streamtube models. ^ Fluxline Theory was extended by removing dependence on a blade element model to better understand how turbine-fluid interaction impacts thrust and power production. This pure momentum variation establishes a cycloturbine performance limit similar to the Betz Limit for horizontal axis wind turbines, as well as the fluid deceleration required to achieve optimum performance. A novel inverse method was developed implementing a new semi-empirical curvilinear flow blade aerodynamic coefficient model to predict optimum cycloturbine blade pitch waveforms from the ideal fluid deceleration. ^ These improved blade pitch waveforms were evaluated on a 1. 37 m diameter by 1. 37 m span cycloturbine to definitively characterize their improvement over existing blade pitch motions and demonstrate the practicality of a variable blade pitch system. The Fluxline Optimal pitching kinematics outperformed sinusoidal and fixed pitching kinematics. The turbine achieved a mean gross aerodynamic power coefficient of 0. 44 (95 % confidence interval: [0. 388, 0. 490]) and 0. 52 (95 % confidence interval: [0. 426, 0. 614]) at tip speed ratios (TSRs) of 1. 5 and 2. 25 respectively which exceeds all other low TSR vertical axis wind turbines. Two-dimensional incompressible Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamic simulations were used to characterize higher order effects of the blade interaction with the fluid. These simulations suggest Fluxline Optimal pitch kinematics achieve high power coefficients by evenly extracting energy from the flow without blade stall or detached turbine wakes. ^ Fluxline Theory was adapted to inform the design of high efficiency cyclorotors by incorporating the concept of rotor angle of attack as well as a power and <b>drag</b> <b>loss</b> model for blade support structure. A blade element version of this theory predicts rotor performance. For hovering, a simplified variation of the theory instructs that cyclorotors will achieve the greatest power loading at low disk loadings with high solidity blades pitched to maximum lift coefficient. Increasing lift coefficients in the upstream portion of the rotor disproportionately increases performance compared to magnifying lift in the downstream portion. This suggests airfoil sections that counter curvilinear flow effects could improve hovering efficiency. Additionally, the simplified hovering theory explains the cyclorotor side force which was observed experimentally, but never adequately explained. In contrast, a separate simplified version of the theory for high speed forward flight points to better rotor performance with a low solidity, high disk loading rotor operated at high advance ratios. High rotor aspect ratios will improve performance in both hover and forward flight. ^ A new mechanical blade pitch mechanism was designed to actuate the high efficiency blade pitch motions predicted by Fluxline Theory for both cyclorotors and cycloturbines. The mechanism optimizes blade pitch at all operating conditions via different cross sections of a three dimensionally contoured cam. Varying the position of the cam accounts for changing wind direction and velocity on a cycloturbine, or for pilot-controlled thrust vectoring, forward speed, and aircraft angle of attack as a cyclorotor. A simplified variation of the mechanism, which implemented fully aerodynamically-shrouded blade pitch links, performed flawlessly on the cycloturbine experiment. ...|$|E
