25|$|Just to make sure: <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> {{that any}} of the above is valid reasoning. I am writing this just to point out what I think are the central 'ideas' the authors had when writing their {{articles}} and how this led them to their conclusions.|$|E

25|$|Well, no, no, I mean he's {{making an}} appeal using his family to gain support. I think it's pretty obvious to anyone {{watching}} what he's been doing. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> he himself is racist. It's comparable to me pointing out I'm Jewish in attracting the Jewish vote. You tailor messages to your audiences and address issues you think your audience cares about.|$|E

25|$|As for the Hellenes, {{it seems}} {{obvious to me that}} ever since they came into {{existence}} they have always used the same language. They were weak at first, when they were separated from the Pelasgians, but they grew from a small group into a multitude, especially when many peoples, including other barbarians in great numbers, had joined them. Moreover, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> the Pelasgian, who remained barbarians, ever grew appreciably in number or power.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> {{that this}} is {{impossible}} or even difficult. There are genius women {{just as there are}} genius men. Ingenuity is not a monopoly for men. It is not in vain that the Holy Quran tells us the story of a woman who led men wisely and bravely and made her people fare the best end: it is the Queen of Sheba, whose story with Solomon is told in Surat Al Naml. I have observed in the University of Qatar that girls make better students than boys.|$|E
25|$|Boston in {{the early}} nineteenth century was a hotbed of {{political}} foment. Howe’s father was a Democrat who considered Harvard University a den of Federalists, and refused to allow his sons to enter the university. Accordingly, in 1818, Howe's father had him enrolled at Brown University. Most of his time there was spent engaged in practical jokes and other hi-jinx and, years later, Howe told his children that he regretted that he hadn’t more seriously applied himself to his studies. One of his classmates, Alexis Caswell, became a doctor and future president of Brown University; he described Howe by the following: “He showed mental capabilities which would naturally fit him for fine scholarship. His mind was quick, versatile, and inventive. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> he was deficient in logical power, but the severer studies did not seem to be congenial to him.” After graduating from Brown in 1821, Howe attended Harvard Medical School, taking his degree in 1824.|$|E
5000|$|During {{questioning}} Durai {{admitted that}} an overestimate {{had been made}} and not corrected. When asked why he had done nothing to correct it, Durai said: [...] "It was an oversight. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> it was of material importance. The donor gives us money because of the brand of the NKF and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> it was so important at that point of time to correct this error." ...|$|R

25|$|Since {{my life as}} a {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because {{it seems to me the}} best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Berry... was a {{good teacher}} and focus for art {{activity}} at the Burslem & Stoke Art School. I do not agree that he is for many the finest 20th century artist from Stoke - there are other candidates also. Mr Berry's work lies somewhere between painting and drawing - for me paint and its properties hold most attraction. Mr Berry's talent was spread over several areas - drawing, painting, writing, plays, poems and teaching. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> I am good enough myself to do several things well, so concentrate on one (painting). Mr Berry said he admired Lowry and once encountered him in a Manchester Gallery - said he was built and made for a particular task - as an artist recording the vanishing industrial scene of Manchester....Mr Berry was, I feel, a humorist whose interest was {{the people of the}} old working class of Stoke - a type of person who no longer exists. I mostly liked his landscapes. They seemed to convey that strange Stoke light which appeals to me and the old buildings and streets which were very much part of my own childhood and youth.|$|E

6000|$|All night I sat {{upon the}} deck of the Sparhawk, thinking, wondering, and conjecturing. I was in a strange state of mind. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> wonder or {{conjecture}} whether Bertha's vessel would come back to me again; <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of what <b>I</b> should <b>do</b> if it <b>did</b> come back. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of what <b>I</b> should <b>do</b> if it never came back. All night I thought, wondered, and conjectured what Mary Phillips had meant by the word [...] "but." ...|$|R

500|$|Responding [...] to Curzon in January 1919, Balfour wrote “Weizmann {{has never}} {{put forward a}} claim for the Jewish Government of Palestine.

500|$|Fox {{had said}} of St Vincent's {{appointment}} in 1801 [...] "allow me to say, that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> {{it would be}} easy, if possible, to find {{a man in the}} whole community better suited, or more capable of the high office he fills, than the distinguished person {{at the head of the}} Admiralty– I mean the Earl of St Vincent." [...] and had continued his support of the Earl throughout his time as first lord.|$|E

500|$|Dworkin {{rejected}} that interpretation of her argument, stating {{in a later}} interview that [...] "I think both intercourse and sexual pleasure can and will survive equality" [...] and suggesting that the misunderstanding came about because of the very sexual ideology she was criticizing: [...] "Since the paradigm for sex {{has been one of}} conquest, possession, and violation, I think many men believe they need an unfair advantage, which at its extreme would be called rape. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> they need it." ...|$|E
500|$|Moran {{apologized for}} the remarks, saying that [...] "I should not have singled out the Jewish {{community}} and regret giving any impression that its members are somehow responsible for the course of action being pursued by the administration, or are somehow behind an impending war... What I {{was trying to say}} is that if more organizations in this country, including religious groups, were more outspoken against war, then <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> we would be pursuing war as an option." ...|$|E
500|$|Bond was {{strongly}} {{opposed to the}} idea that the murderer possessed any kind of scientific or anatomical knowledge, or even [...] "the technical knowledge of a butcher or horse slaughterer". In his opinion, the killer must have been a man of solitary habits, subject to [...] "periodical attacks of homicidal and erotic mania", with the character of the mutilations possibly indicating [...] "satyriasis". Bond also stated that [...] "the homicidal impulse may have developed from a revengeful or brooding condition of the mind, or that religious mania may have been the original disease but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> either hypothesis is likely".|$|E
