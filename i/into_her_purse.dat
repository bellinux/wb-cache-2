500|$|Flight 305, {{approximately}} one-third full, departed {{on schedule}} at 2:50pm, PST. [...] Shortly after takeoff, Cooper handed {{a note to}} Florence Schaffner, the flight attendant situated nearest {{to him in a}} jump seat attached to the aft stair door. Schaffner, assuming the note contained a lonely businessman's phone number, dropped it unopened <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse.</b> Cooper leaned toward her and whispered, [...] "Miss, you'd better look at that note. I have a bomb." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{this time}} Alice, who now had severe {{financial}} reversals, {{took over the}} management of a gown shop in Paris under the firm name of [...] "Gloria Bocher", but soon lost both interest and money in the venture. Her marriage also rapidly collapsed, ending only {{three months after the}} wedding when the couple got into a heated argument in the compartment of an English railroad train over their honeymoon destination. Alice confided to de Trafford that she had purchased the cottage in Happy Valley where they used to rendezvous at the start of their affair, deciding that it would be perfect for their honeymoon. [...] The idea that did not appeal to her new husband; {{during the course of the}} argument, Alice absent-mindedly reached <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> prompting a terrified de Trafford to flee, fearing a new murder attempt. Alice later claimed she had no pistol in her purse, nor had she the intention of shooting him, but instead wanted to powder her nose.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Wilson smiled mournfully as {{she wished}} Humphreys good day {{and put up}} <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> finding the old man so well {{provided}} for; a display or competition in charity never entering <b>into</b> <b>her</b> system of benevolence.|$|R
60|$|She {{slipped the}} money {{carefully}} <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> and hailed a taxi.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was a more}} {{difficult}} matter when, as Elizabeth put her silver coin <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> John must needs repeat the stupid old joke, [...] "There goes stingy Bet!" [...] and Bessie put on her woeful appealing face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Easy {{enough in}} appearance," [...] was Mrs Bowater's comment, as she folded up this stained and flimsy letter again, {{and stuffed it}} <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> [...] "but it's past even Mr Bowater to control what can be read between the lines." ...|$|E
50|$|Also in March 2004, a 90-year-old widow on the Estate criticised a {{judge for}} failing to hand out a prison {{sentence}} to the heroin addict and career criminal who broke <b>into</b> <b>her</b> house and stole Â£80 from <b>her</b> <b>purse.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Lister awkwardly, [...] "I'd {{seen her}} look at <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> and frown, and as I helped {{her up the}} {{locomotive}} steps I pushed a few bills <b>into</b> <b>her</b> hand. I don't think she knew they were paper money. She was highly-strung and anxious to get off before Shillito came along." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it's nice {{to think}} of them reading your grandfather, and not filling up those dreadful little forms all day long," [...] Mrs. Hilbery persisted, her notion of office life being derived from some chance view of a scene behind the counter at her bank, as she slipped the sovereigns <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{tucked the}} check <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> and ambled {{out of the}} room after a supercilious nod to Alora, who failed to return the salutation. Jason Jones stood in his place, still frowning, until Janet's high-heeled shoes had clattered down the two flights of stairs. Alora went to the window and looking down saw that a {{handsome}} automobile stood before the house, with a chauffeur and footman in livery. Janet entered this automobile and was driven away.|$|E
60|$|Polly {{surveyed}} the dainty, shining boot with the scalloped top, the jaunty heel, and the delicate toe, thought her foot did look {{very well in}} it, and after a little pause, said she would have them. It was all very delightful till she got home, and was alone; then, on looking <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> she saw one dollar and the list of things she meant to get for mother and the children. How mean the dollar looked all alone! and how long the list grew when {{there was nothing to}} buy the articles.|$|E
50|$|Nicole (Ariana Gorini) {{finds the}} diary, and she {{promises}} {{to provide it}} to the police, but Peggy (Mary Arden) manages to steal it from <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> during work. That night, Nicole drives to an antique store owned by her paramour, Frank (Dante DiPaolo). He is not there, and while inside she suddenly finds herself stalked by a black clad figure, who had apparently been waiting for her. She gets to the front entrance door but is grabbed from behind by the masked individual, who raises and slams a spiked glove <b>into</b> <b>her</b> face, killing her instantly. The murderer searches the corpse and <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> for the diary. When {{it becomes clear that}} she did not have it, the killer runs out of the shop.|$|R
50|$|She {{makes it}} to the impound lot, only to be denied by the clerk. Sneaking into the gate behind a tow truck, she gets <b>into</b> <b>her</b> car only to find that <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> has been stolen.

50|$|Actually, it {{is further}} {{revealed}} that the money which Naari stole from Jassi comprised counterfeit notes, which she ferried in a bag. While Dev reached home with Palak that night, Naari hid herself behind a tree, and simultaneously, Jassi and his men also succeeded in spotting Naari. While she occupied Naari's room, Palak didn't literally freshen herself, but instead noticed the bag and unknowingly stuffed the cash bundles <b>into</b> <b>her</b> bag and <b>purse,</b> thinking she might get a government bank job for which her private banking firm demanded a bribe. Naari rushes <b>into</b> <b>her</b> room after Palak leaves, but is devastated to find her bag empty, where after, she notices Jassi, who forgives her and confesses his love for her. Naari realizes her mistake and reunites with Jassi. Meanwhile, Dev chases Palak, {{who is in a}} taxi, which is driven by Gurinder himself, and succeeds in earning her attention and affection. He starts dancing and an SUV car stops. He steps aside, the car leaves, and he starts dancing again, little knowing that Jassi and Naari were in the SUV.|$|R
60|$|She {{was much}} put about. She hunted round {{everywhere}} for it. And, as she sought, the conviction {{came into her}} heart {{that her husband had}} taken it. What she had in her purse was all the money she possessed. But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable. He had done so twice before. The first time she had not accused him, and at the week-end he had put the shilling again <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse.</b> So that was how she had known he had taken it. The second time he had not paid back.|$|E
60|$|With that Polly {{slammed down}} the window, {{to the dismay}} of her gentle little pensioners, and began to fly about with great energy, singing and talking to herself as if it was {{impossible}} to keep quiet. She started early to her first lesson that she might have time to buy the tickets, hoping, as she put a five-dollar bill <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> that they would n't be very high, for she felt that she was not in a mood to resist temptation. But she was spared any struggle, for when she reached the place, the ticket office was blocked up by eager purchasers and the disappointed faces that turned away told Polly there was no hope for her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The tenth,' she continued, as she {{squeezed}} the envelope <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> {{with only the}} least hardening of voice, 'although I daresay you have not troubled to remember it--the tenth will be the eighteenth anniversary of our wedding-day. It makes parting, however advisable, and though only for the few days we should think nothing of in happier circumstances, {{a little harder to}} bear. But there, all will come right. You will see things in a different light, perhaps. Words may wound, but time will heal.' But even as she now looked closely into his colourless sunken face some distant memory seemed to well up irresistibly--the memory of eyes just as ingenuous, and as unassuming that even in claiming her love had expressed only their stolid unworthiness.|$|E
60|$|On Saturday mornings {{there was}} {{deposited}} {{on the plate}} of each guest at breakfast time, a long folded paper with Mrs. White's compliments. Anna thrust hers <b>into</b> <b>her</b> pocket unopened, {{and for the first}} time left the house without a smile upon her face. She was practically destitute of jewellery. The few pence left in <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> would only provide a very scanty lunch. Another day of non-success would mean many disagreeable things.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll {{give him}} something, poor little fellow,' said Elfride, pulling out <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> and hastily opening it. From the {{interior}} of <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> a host of bits of paper, like a flock of white birds, floated into the air, and were blown about in all directions.|$|R
50|$|A {{beautiful}} but intoxicated woman, Jennie Jones (Janet Munro), {{returns to her}} London apartment late one night and begins to destroy its contents in a rage, throwing <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> keys and many of her expensive gowns out <b>into</b> the street. <b>Her</b> story is then told in flashback.|$|R
60|$|There was, however, {{difficulty}} to be grappled with. The {{dress was}} old, and when remade {{in a later}} style would be unfortunately plain. The few pairs of gloves she had brought from England were stained and spotted with damp, and her eyes grew wistful as she turned over the stock list of a Victoria dry goods store. The thing would be so easy, if she had {{only a little more}} money, but she sighed as she glanced <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse.</b> Then she took up the gloves and a strip of trimming, and looked at them with a little frown, but while she did so there were footsteps outside, and the door was opened. A man, whom she recognized as a hired hand from a ranch in the neighbourhood, stood in the entrance with a packet in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah don't impugn my punctuality--it's my character!" [...] {{the useful}} lady protested, putting a sixpence from the cabman <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse.</b> Nick went off at {{this with a}} {{simplified}} farewell--went off foreseeing exactly what he found the next day, that the useful lady would have received orders not to budge from her hostess's side. He called on the morrow, late in the afternoon, and Julia saw him liberally, {{in the spirit of}} her assurance that she would be [...] "beautiful" [...] to him, that she had not thrown away his devotion; but Mrs. Gresham remained, with whatever delicacies of deprecation, a spectator of her liberality. Julia looked at him kindly, but her companion was more benignant still; so that what Nick did with his own eyes was not to appeal to her to see him a moment alone, but to solicit, in the name of this luxury, the second occupant of the drawing-room. Mrs. Gresham seemed to say, while Julia said so little, [...] "I understand, my poor friend, I know everything--she has told me only her side, but I'm so competent that I know yours too--and I enter into the whole thing deeply. But it would be as much as my place is worth to accommodate you." [...] Still, she didn't {{go so far as to}} give him an inkling of what he learned on the third day and what he had not gone so far as to suspect--that the two ladies had made rapid arrangements for a scheme of foreign travel. These arrangements had already been carried out when, at the door of the house in Great Stanhope Street, the announcement was made him that the subtle creatures had started that morning for Paris.|$|E
50|$|Polish actress Golda Tencer {{does not}} speak German, even though she spoke her own lines fluently. She had the German text written down on small pieces of paper, hidden in her purse. During the movie she can {{sometimes}} be seen looking down <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>purse.</b>|$|E

50|$|To obtain Veronica's {{love and}} loyalty, Palestrina must endure a more {{traditional}} courtship: Veronica requires him to proclaim love and propose marriage before she relents.
