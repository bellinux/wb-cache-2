50|$|Apart {{from giving}} {{readings}} of <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> in India, Rustam Singh has read <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> {{in other countries}} as well. For example, in 2008 he read <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> in the international poetry festival organised by the Baltic Centre for Writers and Translators, Visby, Sweden.

Similarly, in 2014 he read <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> at the Writers House in Tallinn, Estonia, where the Estonian translations of <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> were read out by the Estonian poet Doris Kareva.|$|R
40|$|The {{manner of}} {{expression}} used by Khaghani {{in some of}} <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> is so strange and complicated that makes the understanding of <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> very difficult and even impossible. Thus, for understanding the meaning of <b>his</b> <b>poems,</b> researchers should ponder on <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> a lot. Although the first attempts for decoding <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> {{date back to the}} first years of his Divanâs publication, and in contemporary time considerable points have been discovered about <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> as orientalists set out to study <b>his</b> <b>poems,</b> still {{there are a number of}} problems in <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> which are incomprehensible and understanding of the poetâs intentions is very difficult. Hence, besides available commentaries, more comprehensive commentaries of Khaghaniâs poems should be written to elucidate ambiguities of his poetry. This article tries to point to some important issues in several difficult verses of Khaghani and, comparing the ideas of Khaghaniâs researchers, it tries to elucidate the mistakes of commentators in explaining such verses and consequently state the aspects which seem to be appropriate...|$|R

5|$|It is {{accepted}} {{that in fact}} Verdaguer invented the story of James's sojourn for <b>his</b> <b>poem,</b> {{since there is no}} record of it before then, and that the poem's popularity created the legend.|$|E

The scene where the Tamil poet Nakkeerar confronts Shiva over {{an error in}} <b>his</b> <b>poem,</b> {{effectively}} exaggerating his sensitivity to right and wrong, {{laid the foundation for}} Thiruvilaiyadal.|$|E
5|$|Mickiewicz {{was welcomed}} into the leading {{literary}} circles of Saint Petersburg and Moscow, {{where he became}} a great favorite for his agreeable manners and extraordinary talent for poetic improvisation. The year 1828 saw the publication of <b>his</b> <b>poem</b> Konrad Wallenrod. Novosiltsev, who recognized its patriotic and subversive message, which had been missed by the Moscow censors, unsuccessfully attempted to sabotage its publication and to damage Mickiewicz's reputation.|$|E
5|$|Mother and I agreed, when {{we talked}} about it, that Dad never meant <b>his</b> <b>poem</b> to apply to one {{particular}} tree, or to the trees of any special region. Just any trees or all trees that might be rained on or snowed on, {{and that would be}} suitable nesting places for robins. I guess they'd have to have upward-reaching branches, too, for the line about 'lifting leafy arms to pray.' Rule out weeping willows.|$|E

5|$|The poet Ovid also {{dealt with}} the mythology of the narcissus. In his Metamorphoses, he recounts {{the story of the}} youth Narcissus who, after his death, is turned into the flower, and it is also {{mentioned}} in Book 5 of <b>his</b> <b>poem</b> Fasti. This theme of metamorphosis was broader than just Narcissus; for instance see crocus, laurel and hyacinth.|$|E

Stanley Woolley, a character in Derek Robinson's Booker shortlisted novel Goshawk Squadron is an Aston Villa fan and names a pre-war starting eleven Villa side.

50|$|About 240 of <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> survive. The New Book of Tang {{reports that}} few of <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> survived because of their strangeness and because of Li's early death. An anecdote in the Taiping Guangji records that a cousin of Li's was asked to compile a {{collection}} of <b>his</b> <b>poems,</b> but {{because he did not}} like Li personally he eventually threw what had been collected in the privy.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1965, Joseph Brodsky {{lived in}} Leningrad (where he {{returned}} after the link). At this time, only occasionally {{he managed to}} publish something of <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> in the Soviet press, <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> printed in emigrant magazines, and the first book of <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> published in 1965 in the United States, entitled [...] "Poems and Poems". It was drawn up without {{the participation of the}} author.|$|R
5|$|Although Apollonius wrote <b>his</b> <b>poem</b> in the 3rd century BC, the {{composition}} of the story of the Argonauts is earlier than Odyssey, which shows familiarity with the exploits of Jason (the wandering of Odysseus may have been partly founded on it). In ancient times the expedition was regarded as a historical fact, an incident in the opening up of the Black Sea to Greek commerce and colonization. It was also extremely popular, forming a cycle to which a number of local legends became attached. The story of Medea, in particular, caught the imagination of the tragic poets.|$|E
5|$|Anniversaries of {{the most}} {{important}} events of Stephen's life have been officially celebrated since the 1870s, including in 1871 the defiant show of solidarity at Putna. This doubled as a protest against Austria-Hungary, which had annexed Bukovina; it was organized by Teodor V. Ștefanelli and was notably attended by poet Mihai Eminescu. Nationalist interpretations still prevailed, particularly after 1881, when Eminescu dedicated <b>his</b> <b>poem</b> Doina (written in the style of traditional Romanian song) to Stephen, calling upon him to leave his grave to again lead his people. His statue was ultimately raised in Iași in 1883.|$|E
5|$|Arp and Janco {{drifted away}} from the {{movement}} ca. 1919, when they created the Constructivist-inspired workshop Das Neue Leben. In Romania, Dada was awarded an ambiguous reception from Tzara's former associate Vinea. Although he was sympathetic to its goals, treasured Hugo Ball and Hennings and promised to adapt his own writings to its requirements, Vinea cautioned Tzara and the Jancos in favor of lucidity. When Vinea submitted <b>his</b> <b>poem</b> Doleanțe ("Grievances") {{to be published by}} Tzara and his associates, he was turned down, an incident which critics attribute to a contrast between the reserved tone of the piece and the revolutionary tenets of Dada.|$|E
40|$|Hamit Macit Selekler is a Turkish {{poet who}} contributed to poetry since 1929. The book in which he {{published}} <b>his</b> selected <b>poems</b> is called “İyilik” (Goodness) (1956). <b>His</b> <b>poems</b> are {{the best examples of}} İslamic-Turkish esthetics. In <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> he treated of the themes, such as our country, Turkey, our values, especially love-affection, love for his country and the sense of heroism. The Language he used in <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> are the best and the most perfect samples of Turkish Language...|$|R
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>poems</b> reflect social {{structure}} of his time and are a considered a source for investigating Iran in Qajar dynasty era and their attitudes. <b>His</b> <b>poems</b> had been translated in Turkish, Farsi and Azeri.|$|R
50|$|In 1844 {{he walked}} from Debrecen to Pest {{to find a}} {{publisher}} for <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> and he succeeded. <b>His</b> <b>poems</b> were becoming increasingly popular. He relied on folkloric elements and popular, traditional song-like verses.|$|R
5|$|Epicurus (341 – 270 BC) {{anticipated}} {{the idea of}} natural selection. The Roman philosopher and atomist Lucretius (c. 99 – 55 BC) explicated these ideas in <b>his</b> <b>poem</b> De rerum natura (On the Nature of Things). In the Epicurean system, {{it was assumed that}} many living forms had been spontaneously generated from Gaia in the past, but that only the most functional forms had survived to have offspring. The Epicureans did not anticipate the full theory of evolution as we now know it, but seem to have postulated separate abiogenetic events for each species.|$|E
5|$|Her {{death was}} widely publicised shortly {{afterwards}} by the Polish press, which contributed to her growing fame. Plater {{became one of}} the symbols of the uprising. The symbol of the fighting girl became quite widespread both in Poland, Lithuania and abroad. Mickiewicz immortalized her in <b>his</b> <b>poem,</b> Śmierć pułkownika (Death of a Colonel), although the description of her death is a pure poetical fiction and was only loosely based on her real life. Mickiewicz has also idealized her personality and skills, portraying her as the ideal commander, worshiped by her soldiers. That poem has entered the elementary curriculum in the independent Poland.|$|E
5|$|Leicester possessed one of {{the largest}} {{collections}} of paintings in Elizabethan England, being the first great private collector. He was a principal patron of Nicholas Hilliard, as well as interested in all aspects of Italian culture. The Earl's circle of scholars and men of letters included, among others, his nephew Philip Sidney, the astrologer and Hermeticist John Dee, his secretaries Edward Dyer and Jean Hotman, as well as John Florio and Gabriel Harvey. Through Harvey, Edmund Spenser found employment at Leicester House on the Strand, the Earl's palatial town house, where he wrote his first works of poetry. Many years after Leicester's death Spenser wistfully recalled this time in his Prothalamion, and in 1591 he remembered the late Earl with <b>his</b> <b>poem</b> The Ruins of Time.|$|E
50|$|He {{followed}} the classical rules of poetry {{in terms of}} rhyme and rhythm. He wrote most of <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> in the forms of Ghazal and Qasidah. The content of <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> are about Love and Nature. In some of <b>his</b> <b>poems,</b> he also mentions sufism. He was instrumental in introducing the Sulaimaniya sorani school of poetry (in particular Nalî's poetry) to the Kurds of Mukriyan region and western Iran.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the best}} known Mizo {{language}} poets, Awithangpa (1885-1965) (whose real name is Hmarlûtvunga) was active during this period. The beautiful, innovative expressions he used in <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> are now generally thought by most to be part of Mizo poetic language since time immemorial, although {{he was the first to}} use them and were in fact mostly his own coinage. Examples include expressions such as ram loh, chohar di etc. The great reputation of <b>his</b> zai (<b>poems)</b> among Mizo people can be judged from the fact that, although <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> were not initially recorded in writing, when Mizo littérateurs later tried to collect and record <b>his</b> <b>poems,</b> people still remembered most of <b>his</b> <b>poems</b> and could still recite them in full.|$|R
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>poems</b> {{were first}} {{published}} in the French anthology of Moroccan poetry La Memoire future (Maspero, 1976, ed. by Tahar Ben Jelloun). <b>His</b> <b>poems</b> were regularly published in the cultural supplement of the daily newspaper Al-'Alam.|$|R
