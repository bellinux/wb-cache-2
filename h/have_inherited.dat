5|$|Many stories tell of fox-wives bearing children. When such progeny are human, {{they possess}} special {{physical}} or supernatural qualities that often pass {{to their own}} children. The astrologer-magician Abe no Seimei was reputed to <b>have</b> <b>inherited</b> such extraordinary powers.|$|E
5|$|Chronic copper {{toxicity}} {{does not}} normally occur in humans because of transport systems that regulate absorption and excretion. Autosomal recessive mutations in copper transport proteins can disable these systems, leading to Wilson's disease with copper accumulation and cirrhosis {{of the liver}} in persons who <b>have</b> <b>inherited</b> two defective genes.|$|E

On a charter to the New Minster at Winchester, the names of Ælfthryth and her son Æthelred appear ahead of Edward's name. When Edgar died on 8 July 975, Æthelred was probably nine and Edward {{only a few years}} older.|$|E

5|$|Pain {{was born}} {{some time before}} 1100. His father {{may have been in}} the service of King Henry in Normandy before Henry became king. The family lands in England, which were not extensive, were mainly in East Anglia, and Pain appears to <b>have</b> <b>inherited</b> most of them; his payment for danegeld, a tax, in 1130 for his East Anglian {{properties}} was 40shillings, compared to only 9 shillings for his brother Eustace.|$|E
5|$|A {{nephew of}} the last Emperor, Constantine XI, Andreas Palaiologos claimed to <b>have</b> <b>inherited</b> the title of Byzantine Emperor. He lived in the Morea until its fall in 1460, then escaped to Rome where he lived under the {{protection}} of the Papal States for the remainder of his life. Since the office of emperor had never been technically hereditary, Andreas' claim would have been without merit under Byzantine law. However, the Empire had vanished, and Western states generally followed the Roman-church-sanctioned principles of hereditary sovereignty. Seeking a life in the west, Andreas styled himself Imperator Constantinopolitanus ("Emperor of Constantinople"), and sold his succession rights to both Charles VIII of France and the Catholic Monarchs.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{launched}} two legal actions {{while in}} prison {{to secure a}} share of the estate, which the cousins said was part of an attempt to harass and vilify them. In 2003 he began a High Court action to recover £1.2m from the estate of his adoptive grandmother, arguing that he should <b>have</b> <b>inherited</b> her home at Carbonnells Farm, Wix, Essex, which went instead to June's sister—the grandmother had cut Bamber out of her will when he was arrested—and that he was owed 17 years' rent from his cousins who lived there. In 2004 he went to the High Court again to claim a £326,000 share of the profit from the caravan site. The court ruled against him.|$|E

5000|$|Alfred John Norman Chamberlin (1822-1883), and {{his wife}} Betsy, owned the Broad House {{property}} {{and most of the}} Wroxham Broad, before the Traffords acquired it after Alfred's death about 1885. People flocked to their property to watch the Wroxham Regatta. (See painting [...] "Wroxham Regatta -1868" [...] by Claude Nursey.) Alfred <b>had</b> <b>inherited</b> the 300 acre property about 1858 from his unmarried cousin, Elizabeth Foulsham (1774-1857). She <b>had</b> <b>inherited</b> it from her unmarried half-brother, William Buckle (1765-1840) who <b>had</b> <b>inherited</b> it from his maternal grandfather, John Howse (d. 1817). Howse's forebears had owned the property since 1735. Prior owners have been recorded back to 1593.|$|R

5|$|Crane {{starts to}} believe that a {{conspiracy}} links all the deaths together, so he looks into Van Garrett's last will. Van Garrett had made a new will just before he died, leaving all his possessions to his secret new bride, Emily Winship, whom Crane discovers was pregnant with Van Garrett's child. Crane deduces that all who knew about the new will, the marriage and the pregnancy were the victims of the Horseman and that Katrina's father Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), who would <b>have</b> <b>inherited</b> the fortune, is the person holding the skull. Katrina, finding out that Crane suspects her father, burns all the evidence that Crane has accumulated.|$|E

A notable {{ancestor}} of Frank is Periclymenus, who was given the ability of shapeshifting by his grandfather, Poseidon. It is revealed that the descendants of Periclymenus <b>have</b> <b>inherited</b> this ability, and Frank learns to use it late in the novel. Frank is a Roman demigod at Camp Jupiter, a camp for Roman demigods. Frank has a crush on Hazel, which she reciprocates. He is a Chinese Canadian.|$|E
5|$|In 1669, Anna Maria Luisa was {{considered}} as a potential bride to Louis, le Grand Dauphin, the heir-apparent of Louis XIV of France. Cosimo III {{did not like the}} idea of a French marriage, and never devoted himself fully to the cause (she was later rejected). Instead, Cosimo offered her to his first choice, Peter II of Portugal. Peter's ministers, fearing that Princess Anna Maria Luisa would dominate Peter II and fearing she might <b>have</b> <b>inherited</b> Marguerite Louise’s manner, declined. In fact, contemporaries thought her traits to be a combination of those of her father and paternal grandmother, Vittoria della Rovere.|$|E

5|$|On 7 April 1986, {{a healthy}} hybrid kitten between a male serval {{and a female}} {{domestic}} cat was born; this kitten was larger than a typical domestic kitten and resembled its father in its coat pattern. It appeared to <b>have</b> <b>inherited</b> a few domestic traits, such as tameness, from its mother. The hybrid cat may have a doglike habit of following its owner about, and {{can be a good}} swimmer. Over the years, savannah cats have gained popularity as pets.|$|E
5|$|Pearse {{found that}} there was no {{possibility}} of improvement but that Michael Schiavo's decisions might have been influenced by the potential to inherit what remained of Terri Schiavo's estate as long as he remained married to her. Due to a lack of a living will and questions regarding Michael's credibility, Pearse recommended denying his petition to remove her feeding tube. Pearse reported that the issue of conflict of interest applied to the Schindlers as well since, had Michael divorced Terri as they wanted him to, they would <b>have</b> <b>inherited</b> the remainder of Mrs. Schiavo's estate upon her death.|$|E
5|$|The Darwins had ten children: two died in infancy, and Annie's {{death at}} the age of ten had a devastating effect on her parents. Charles was a devoted father and uncommonly {{attentive}} to his children. Whenever they fell ill, he feared that they might <b>have</b> <b>inherited</b> weaknesses from inbreeding due to the close family ties he shared with his wife and cousin, Emma Wedgwood. He examined this topic in his writings, contrasting it with the advantages of crossing amongst many organisms. Despite his fears, most of the surviving children and many of their descendants went on to have distinguished careers (see Darwin-Wedgwood family).|$|E

5|$|The painting's known {{provenance}} {{begins in}} the 1830s when {{it was in the}} possession of the Radziwiłł family. According to art historian Sulpiz Boisserée, who saw the painting in 1832, Antoni Radziwiłł found the painting in an estate his father owned. Waagen speculated that may have belonged to Mikolai Radziwill (1549–1616) who might <b>have</b> <b>inherited</b> it from his brother Jerzy Radziwill, (1556–1600), who was a cardinal. The family kept it until 1920 when Princess Radziwill sold it to the Duveen Brothers in Paris. Philip Lehman bought it in October 1920; it is now held in the Robert Lehman collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York.|$|E
5|$|Count Geoffrey died in 1151 before finalizing the {{division}} of his realm between Henry and Henry's younger brother Geoffrey, who would <b>have</b> <b>inherited</b> Anjou. According to William of Newburgh, who wrote in the 1190s, Count Geoffrey decided that Henry would receive England and Anjou {{for as long as}} he needed the resources for the conflict against Stephen. Count Geoffrey instructed that his body should not be buried until Henry swore an oath that the young Geoffrey would receive Anjou when England and Normandy were secured. W. L. Warren cast doubt on this account on the grounds that it was written later based on a single contemporary source, it would be questionable that either Geoffrey or Henry would consider such an oath binding and it would break the inheritance practice of the time. The young Geoffrey died in 1158, before receiving Anjou, but he had become count of Nantes when the citizens of Nantes rebelled against their ruler. Henry had supported the rebellion.|$|E

5|$|Scientist David Banner has {{the idea}} to create super {{soldiers}} by introducing modified DNA sequences extracted from various animals to strengthen the human cellular response, but General Thaddeus Ross denies him permission to use human subjects. Banner subsequently conducts the experiments on himself. After {{the birth of his}} son Bruce, he finds that his son may <b>have</b> <b>inherited</b> the effects and seeks a cure, but is stopped in the process. Following a traumatic event, Bruce remembers nothing of the incident, and has been raised by the Krenzlers. Years later, Bruce is a geneticist working with his girlfriend, Betty Ross, within the Berkeley Biotechnology Institute on nanomed research. The pair hopes to achieve instantaneous cell repair by using low level Gamma radiation exposure to activate the nanomeds once they are introduced into a living organism. During routine maintenance of their appropriated gamma-ray spectrometer, a circuit shorts and triggers the experiment's program sequence. Unable to prevent the machine from firing, Bruce throws himself in front of a colleague to shield the man and is exposed to a massive amount of gamma radiation.|$|E
5|$|Since {{breeding}} Scamper was not {{an option}} for genetic inheritability, James spent several years researching the possibility of cloning. She chose ViaGen, an animal genetics corporation based in Austin, Texas, to perform the cloning procedure for $150,000. James registered the resulting colt born in 2006 with the American DNA Registry under the name Clayton, who is an identical genetic match to Scamper. James chose a surrogate mare to be the dam of the colt and receive the cloned embryo. At age two, James started Clayton as a breeding stallion. She offered his services to the public at a fee of $4,000. Clayton sired healthy progeny, many of whom <b>have</b> <b>inherited</b> Scamper's genetics. Of special note, the AQHA does not register cloned horses; however, breed registration is not required to compete in barrel racing or other PRCA and WPRA sanctioned rodeo events.|$|E
5|$|The work {{ends with}} the {{following}} words: Fichte and the powerful men who <b>have</b> <b>inherited</b> his ideals, when they see children, think: 'Here is material that I can manipulate'... All this, to any person with natural affection for the young, is horrible; just as we teach children to avoid being destroyed by motor cars if they can, so we should teach them to avoid being destroyed by cruel fanatics... This is the task of a liberal education: to {{give a sense of}} the value of things other than domination, to help create wise citizens of a free community, and through the combination of citizenship with liberty in individual creativeness to enable men to give to human life that splendour which some few have shown that it can achieve (Russell 1938:251).|$|E
