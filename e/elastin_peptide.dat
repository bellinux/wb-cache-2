40|$|AbstractThe {{existence}} of a novel receptor on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) and monocytes was demonstrated, named soluble <b>elastin</b> <b>peptide</b> receptor. Soluble elastin peptides, like K-elastin, which are liberated from elastin fibres, {{can be found in}} the sera, and they possess several biological activities such as chemotaxis. Studying the effects of elastin peptides on leukocytes, it was found that: (i) the <b>elastin</b> <b>peptide</b> stimulates the oxidative burst, the intracellular free Ca 2 + elevation through a specific receptor; and (ii) in the signal transduction mechanism of this <b>elastin</b> <b>peptide</b> receptor, the phosphatidylinositol breakdown is involved...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{clinical}} investigations <b>elastin</b> <b>peptide</b> concentration {{has been proposed}} as one potential marker of lung elastin degradation. No epidemiological study has yet confirmed this hypothesis. METHODS: The relation of <b>elastin</b> <b>peptide</b> concentration to some factors closely related to pulmonary emphysema (age, smoking habits, FEV 1 alpha protease inhibitor (PI) phenotype) and to alcohol consumption was examined in an epidemiological study of 310 working men. The elastin peptides used for obtaining antibodies and as reference in an ELISA assay were prepared from chemically hydrolysed elastin. RESULTS: The <b>elastin</b> <b>peptide</b> concentration significantly decreased with age from 2. 92 (1. 54) micrograms/ml among subjects younger than 30 years to 2. 18 (1. 14) micrograms/ml among subjects older than 50. <b>Elastin</b> <b>peptide</b> concentration did not differ with smoking habits and was clearly unrelated to FEV 1. A lower <b>elastin</b> <b>peptide</b> concentration was observed in all groups of subjects with a protease inhibitor phenotype other than PI MM (PI FM, IM, MP, MS, MZ, and S phenotypes). CONCLUSIONS: The results cast doubts on {{the usefulness of the}} <b>elastin</b> <b>peptide</b> concentration as a marker of lung destruction in middle aged, predominantly healthy men. Blood <b>elastin</b> <b>peptide</b> concentration may reflect both elastin degradation and resynthesis. The results of this analysis suggest that several factors (age, alcohol consumption, non-PI MM phenotype) may be associated with decreased resynthesis of lung elastin. Further studies, conducted in various age groups and including estimates of the degree of lung destruction, are needed to unravel the mechanisms underlying lysis and resynthesis of lung elastin...|$|E

RT-PCR analysis indicated that <b>elastin</b> <b>peptides</b> did not modify the MMP- 1 mRNA steady state levels, suggesting the involvement of a post-transcriptional mechanism. We previously reported that binding of <b>elastin</b> <b>peptides</b> to EBP induced other matrix metalloproteinases (MMP- 2 and MT 1 -MMP) expression. Since those peptides were here found to also accelerate the secretion of urokinase from HT- 1080 cells, culture medium was supplemented with plasminogen together with <b>elastin</b> <b>peptides</b> at aims to induce or potentiate MMPs activation cascades.

40|$|AbstractElastin peptides, such as κ-elastin (kE), bind to the elastin {{receptor}} at {{the cell}} surface of human dermal fibroblasts and stimulate collagenase- 1 expression at the gene and protein levels.

40|$|The sialidase {{activity}} of neuraminidase- 1 (Neu- 1) {{is responsible for}} ERK 1 / 2 pathway activation following binding of <b>elastin</b> <b>peptide</b> on the elastin receptor complex. In this work, we demonstrate that the receptor and lipid rafts colocalize at the plasma membrane. We also show that the disruption of these microdomains {{as well as their}} depletion in glycolipids blocks the receptor signaling. Following <b>elastin</b> <b>peptide</b> treatment, the cellular GM 3 level decreases while lactosylceramide (LacCer) content increases consistently with a GM 3 /LacCer conversion. The use of lactose or Neu- 1 siRNA blocks this process suggesting that the elastin receptor complex is responsible for this lipid conversion. Flow cytometry analysis confirms this elastin peptide-driven LacCer generation. Further, the use of a monoclonal anti-GM 3 blocking antibody shows that GM 3 is required for signaling. In conclusion, our data strongly suggest that Neu- 1 -dependent GM 3 /LacCer conversion is the key event leading to signaling by the elastin receptor complex.

Methods:A cross-sectional population study and a prospective cohort study of small abdominal aortic aneurysms was performed in a community setting. All previous diagnoses recorded in a hospital computer database were received for 4404 men 65 to 73 years of age who {{had been invited to}} a population screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm. One hundred forty-one men had AAA (4. 2 %). They were asked to participate in an interview, a clinical examination, and collection of blood sample. Men with an abdominal aortic aneurysm 3 to 5 cm in diameter were offered annual ultrasound scans to check for expansion. Results:Among patients with COPD 7. 7 % had abdominal aortic aneurysms (crude odds ratio = 2. 05). The adjusted odds ratio, however, was only 1. 59 after adjustment for coexisting diseases associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (P =. 13). The mean annual expansion was 2. 74 mm per year among patients with COPD, 2. 72 among patients without COPD, and 4. 7 mm among patients who used oral steroids compared with 2. 6 among patients who did not use steroids (P <. 05). Concentration of serum <b>elastin</b> <b>peptide</b> and plasma elastase–α 1 -antitrypsin complexes correlated negatively with forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1) among patients with COPD. However, multivariate regression analysis showed that concentration of serum <b>elastin</b> <b>peptide,</b> therapy with β-agonists, and FEV 1 correlated positively with degree of expansion but that concentration of plasma elastase–α 1 -antitrypsin complexes and serum α 1 -antitrypsin did not influence expansion, suggesting that elastase {{plays an important role in}} the pathogenesis of COPD but not of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Conclusion:The high prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm among patients with COPD is more likely to be caused by medication and coexisting diseases rather than a common pathway of pathogenesis.

In small amounts (between 0. 1 and 1 microgram/ml), <b>elastin</b> <b>peptides</b> strongly increased calcium influx and inhibited calcium efflux by an apparently calmodulin-dependent mechanism. They also were shown to increase sodium influx and to decrease rubidium influx in monocyte preparations obtained from human blood. Only the ouabain-sensitive portion of rubidium influx was inhibited.

Conversely, the aggregated state shows evidence for antiparallel cross-β structures. Our molecular studies highlight the important role of PPII conformation on the prefibrillar state, putting forward the hypothesis that aggregation takes place through addition of the monomer in the PPII conformation with preformed β-sheet aggregates and/or through direct interaction of PPII helices...|$|E

Synthetic <b>elastin</b> <b>peptide</b> VGVAPG elicited chemotactic responses to the cultured keratinocytes at the dose of 10 − 9 [*]M. Treatment of keratinocytes with 10 − 6 or 10 − 5 [*]M elastin peptides resulted in the suppression of cell growth and the increased expression of involucrin and transglutaminase- 1, markers of terminal differentiation. When cultured keratinocytes were treated with the elastin peptides, the expression of 67 [*]kDa elastin receptor was increased. The induction of terminal differentiation by elastin peptides was attenuated by the treatment with the combination of anti- 67 [*]kDa elastin receptor antibody. The results indicate that elastin is a potent inducer of migration and terminal differentiation of cultured keratinocytes, which is mediated by the 67 [*]kDa elastin receptor. In the lesional skins of patients with elastosis perforans serpiginosa, the 67 [*]kDa elastin receptor was specifically expressed in the epidermis immediately surrounding the elastic materials that were being eliminated.

To identify the chemotactic sites on elastin, we examined the chemotactic activity of VaI-Gly-VaI-Ala-Pro-Gly (VGVAPG), a repeating peptide in tropoelastin. We observed that VGVAPG was chemotactic for fibroblasts and monocytes, with optimal activity at ~ 10 - 8 M, and that the chemotactic activity of VGVAPG was substantial (half or greater) relative to the maximum responses to other chemotactic factors such as platelet-derived growth factor for fibroblasts and formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine for monocytes.

40|$|The {{progression}} of structural {{changes in the}} pulmonary arterial bed were followed in a model of chronic pulmonary hypertension. Chronically instrumented awake sheep received continuous air embolization for 0 (controls), 1, 4, 8, or 12 days (n = 5 - 6 /group). After the period of embolization, the lungs were removed, the pulmonary arteries were distended with barium-gelatin, and the lungs were fixed via the airways with formal-saline. Quantitative techniques were applied to sections from random blocks from the lungs of each animal. One day of embolization resulted in granulocyte sequestration in the lung interstitium and in small vessels; additionally, intraalveolar and perivascular edema was present. By 4 days, increased medial thickness, appearance of muscle in smaller arteries than normal (e. g., muscular arteries at alveolar duct level: control = 1. 2 +/- 1. 2 %; day 4 = 22. 7 +/- 7. 7) and reduction in number of barium-filled intraacinar arteries was found. The arterial changes progressed in severity to day 8 and were similar at day 12. Since arterial remodelling involves increased elastin deposition, the concentration of <b>elastin</b> <b>peptides</b> was measured in lung lymph. Increased flux of <b>elastin</b> <b>peptides</b> was apparent from day 2 of embolization and continued to increase to a level 20 x baseline by day 12 (baseline 351 +/- 86 micrograms/ 15 min; day 12 = 6338 +/- 2999). Comparison of {{the onset of the}} structural changes with previous findings shows that the arterial remodelling parallels the onset of sustained pulmonary hypertension. The increase in lung-lymph <b>elastin</b> <b>peptides</b> by day 2 provides evidence that vascular remodelling is initiated before day 4 of embolization.

40|$|Arterial elastin {{appears to}} be a proteinlipid complex with the lipid {{component}} being bound to <b>elastin</b> <b>peptide</b> groups. In atherosclerotic lesions the lipid content of elastin increases progressively with increasing severity of atherosclerosis. The increases in the lipid content of plaque elastin are mainly due to large increases in cholesterol with about 80 % of the cholesterol being cholesterol ester. This deposition of cholesterol in elastin accounts for a substantial part of the total cholesterol accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions of all stages. The present in vitro study suggests that the mechanism involved in the deposition of lipids in arterial elastin may be an interaction of the elastin protein with serum or arterial low density or very low density lipoproteins (LDL and VLDL) resulting in a transfer of lipids, but not of lipoprotein protein to the elastin. No significant lipid transfer occurred from the high density lipoproteins or chylomicrons. The amount of lipid taken up by plaque elastin was strikingly higher than by normal elastin and consisted mainly of cholesterol with over 80 % of the cholesterol being cholesterol ester. The precondition for the lipid accumulation in plaque elastin appeared to be an altered amino acid composition of the elastin protein consisting of an increase in polar amino acids and a reduction in cross-linking amino acids. Subsequent treatment of lipoprotein-incubated arterial elastin with hot alkali and apolipoproteins did not reverse the binding of lipoprotein lipid to diseased elastin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The elastic {{properties}} of extensible tissues such as arteries and skin are mainly {{due to the}} presence of elastic fibers whose major component is the extracellular matrix protein elastin. Pathophysiological degradation of this protein leads to the generation of elastin peptides that have been identified in the circulation in the ng/mL to mg/mL range. Similar concentrations of an <b>elastin</b> <b>peptide</b> preparation (k-elastin) were previously demonstrated to induce, among other biological actions, a dose- and endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation mediated by the elastin/laminin receptor and by endothelial NO production. To determine the elastin sequence(s) responsible for vasomotor activity and to learn more about possible signaling pathways, we have compared the action of different concentrations (10213 to 1027 mol/L) of recombinant human tropoelastin, eight synthetic elastin peptides, and a control peptide (VPVGGA) on both rat aortic ring tension and [Ca 21]i of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. No vasoactivity could be detected for VPVGGA and for the elastin-related sequences VGVGVA, PGVGVA, and GVGVA. Tropoelastin, VGV, PGV, and VGVAPG were found to induce an endothelium- and dose-dependent vasorelaxation and to increase endothelial [Ca 21]i, whereas PVGV and VGVA produced these effects only at low concentration (10211 mol/L). A likely candidate for mediating the elastin peptide–related effects is the elastin/laminin receptor, since the presence of lactose strongly inhibited the vasoactivity associated with these compounds. Our results show that although the flanking amino acids modulate its activity, VGV seems to be the core sequence recognized by the elastin receptor. (Circ Res. 1998; 82 : 328 - 336. ...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study was}} to explore the relationship between levels of EP and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and single breath transfer factor for carbon monoxide (TLCO and KCO) in coal miners. METHODS: The study population comprised 227 working coal miners aged 34 - 50 years consisting of 75 miners heavily exposed to underground coal dust with pulmonary radiographs classified as 0 / 1 or 1 / 0 by the International Labour Office classification, 75 exposed miners with radiographs classified as normal (0 / 0), and 77 miners slightly exposed to coal dust with normal radiographs. The subjects answered a standardised questionnaire and performed spirometric tests and a carbon monoxide (CO) transfer test. RESULTS: No association was observed between EP levels and % predicted FEV 1 (or FEV 1 /FVC). The level of EP increased significantly with decreased % predicted TLCO (r = - 0. 20). Miners in the lowest % predicted KCO quintile had higher EP levels than the rest (3. 28 (1. 37) vs 2. 47 (1. 16)). A significantly lower EP level was observed in miners with radiographs classified as 1 / 0 or 0 / 1, especially in those with round opacities, compared with miners with a normal radiograph, and in current smokers compared with the rest. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the level of EP may reflect some remodelling activity in emphysema and lung fibrosis. ...|$|E

EPs interaction with S-Gal triggered NO release and activation of PI 3 -kinase / Akt and ERK 1 / 2 in human coronary endothelial cells (HCAECs) and rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (RCs). This signaling pathway, as designated as RISK, for reperfusion injury salvage kinase pathway, was shown to be responsible for the beneficial influence of EPs on ischemia/reperfusion injury on the basis of its inhibition by specific pharmacological inhibitors. EPs survival activity was attained at a concentration averaging that present into the blood circulation, supporting the contention that these matrikines might offer a natural protection against cardiac injury in young and adult individuals. Such protective effect might be lost with aging, since we found that hearts from 24 -month-old rats did not respond to EPs. —Robinet, A., Millart, H., Oszust, F., Hornebeck, W., Bellon, G.

40|$|Elastin is {{the protein}} {{responsible}} for the resilience of vertebrate tissue. It is an extremely stable protein deposited {{during the early stages}} of life and experiencing almost no renewal. As a consequence, it can be considered that each individual has an elastin capital for life. Despite its extreme stability, elastin can be degraded by several enzymes termed elastases. Elastases are among the most aggressive proteases, and their presence is increased with age. As a consequence, elastin fragmentation resulting in the generation of <b>elastin</b> <b>peptides</b> is one of the hallmarks of aging. This review will examine their nature and further expose our current understanding of the role played by these peptides in aging and their contribution to tissue homeostasis and several pathologies...|$|R

For this purpose, we firstly characterized by turbidimetry and differential scanning calorimetry the synthetic S 4 fragment peptide containing the XGGZG motif (where X and Z correspond to Valine or Leucine) which is able to form amyloid fibres under certain conditions. We also investigated two mediumsized elastin-related model <b>elastin</b> <b>peptides</b> containing the VGVPG motif (E 50 and E 18) {{as well as their}} analogues where proline is hydroxylated in hydroxyproline. These peptides were shown to coacervate, and a close correlation was found between the inverse transition temperature obtained by turbidimetry and the clathrate-like structures evidenced at low temperature by the calorimetric method...|$|R

The production of this enzyme involved in stromal reaction {{is caused by the}} sustained activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2) pathway via cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K). However, the mecha-nism of these signaling events remains unknown.

40|$|International audienceThe elastin binding protein (EBP), a spliced {{variant of}} {{lysosomal}} β-galactosidase, {{is the primary}} receptor of <b>elastin</b> <b>peptides</b> that {{have been linked to}} emphysema, aneurysm and cancer progression. The sequences recognized by EBP share the XGXXPG consensus pattern found in numerous matrix proteins, notably in elastin where the VGVAPG motif is repeated. To delineate the elastin binding site of human EBP, we built a homology model of this protein and docked VGVAPG on its surface. Analysis of this model suggested that Gln- 97 and Asp- 98 were required for interaction with VGVAPG because they contribute to the definition of a pocket thought to represent the elastin binding site of EBP. Additionally, we proposed that Leu- 103, Arg- 107, and Glu- 137 were essential residues because they could interact with VGVAPG itself. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments at these key positions validated our model. This work therefore provides the first structural data concerning the interaction of the VGVAPG with its cognate receptor. The present structural data should now allow the development of EBP-specific antagonists...|$|R
40|$|Post-translational {{modifications}} play a {{key role}} in defining the biological functions of proteins. Among them, the hydroxylation of proline producing the (2 S, 4 R) - 4 -hydroxyproline (Hyp) is one of the most frequent modifications observed in vertebrates, being particularly abundant in the proteins of the extracellular matrix. In collagen, hydroxylation of proline plays a critical role, conferring the correct structure and mechanical strength to collagen fibres. In elastin, the exact role of this modification is not yet understood. Here, we show that Hyp-containing elastin polypeptides have flexible molecular structures, analogously to proline-containing polypeptides. In turn, the self-assembly of the <b>elastin</b> <b>peptides</b> is significantly altered by the presence of Hyp, evidencing different supramolecular structures. Also the in vitro susceptibility to protease digestion is changed. These findings give a better insight into the elastic fibre formation and degradation processes in the extracellular matrix. Furthermore, our results could contribute in defining the subtle role of proline structural variants in the folding and self-assembly of elastin-inspired peptides, helping the rational design of elastin biomaterials...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective: serum <b>elastin</b> <b>peptides</b> (SEP) {{have been}} {{reported}} {{to be associated with the}} expansion of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Consequently, SEP-measurements may predict future rupture, and allow further selection for surgery in cases referred for surgery due to size. Material and methods: SEP was measured in 90 men and 10 women with AAA, who were considered for surgery as part of the Chichester aneurysm screening programme. Sixty-one patients were electively operated and four because of symptoms. The rest were followed up further. Twelve of these experienced ruptured AAA later. Results: no correlation between last measured AAA-diameter, annual expansion rate and SEP was noticed. However, SEP levels were significantly higher in cases rupturing later, persisting after adjustment for age, sex, and last measured AAA-size. ROC curve analysis concerning SEP as a predictor of rupture later showed an optimal sensitivity and specificity of 67 % and 60 %, respectively, similar with last measured AAA-size. By combining AAA-size and SEP, the optimal sensitivity and specificity reached 83 % and 66 %, respectively. Conclusion: one sampling of SEP combined with AAA-size in patients referred for AAA surgery may be a clinical useful indicator of high rupture risk...|$|R
