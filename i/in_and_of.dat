5|$|Electronic Frontier Foundation {{attorney}} Corynne McSherry and Paul Levy of Public Citizen {{commented on}} the case to Ars Technica, calling Beck's trademark claim before the WIPO ridiculous. The Citizen Media Law Project agreed with this assessment. Levy noted that domain names, <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> themselves, {{could be seen as}} defamatory; however, the statement in the domain name would have to be deemed both false and malicious. Levy and McSherry thought that the filing may have been to ascertain Eiland-Hall's identity, which was anonymous prior to the complaint. McSherry couldn't recall a prior case where an individual asserted a domain name was libelous. Jack Bremer of The First Post wrote that the attempt by Beck's lawyers arguing the domain name of the website was itself defamatory had likely never occurred before in the field of information technology law.|$|E
5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> itself.|$|E

30|$|The {{livelihood}} diversification {{literature in}} pastoral areas has widely {{recognized that the}} household labour composition plays {{a critical role in}} the participation <b>in</b> <b>and</b> choice <b>of</b> non-farm income. This is particularly true in pastoral societies, where mobility is a critical livelihood factor, such that household labour is an even more prominent factor determining the participation <b>in</b> <b>and</b> choice <b>of</b> non-pastoral income. Therefore, household mobility status, estimates <b>of</b> household income <b>and</b> its sources <b>and</b> the disaggregation <b>of</b> income between household members <b>in</b> permanent <b>and</b> satellite settlements provide insights into participation <b>in</b> <b>and</b> choice <b>of</b> NPIs.|$|R
5|$|Many mental states {{seem to be}} {{experienced}} subjectively in different ways by different individuals. And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since {{no one has a}} perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly how it feels to hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.|$|E

5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> itself, but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some drugs can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E
