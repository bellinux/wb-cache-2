5|$|Since the Victorian era the Thames {{has been}} {{extensively}} embanked, {{and many of its}} London tributaries now flow underground.

5|$|Upon {{passing by}} Oahu, Iniki {{produced}} tides of 1.7–3feet (0.5–0.9m) above normal.

A total of 24,137families or 141,974persons left their homes, 57,198 of which fled to evacuation centers because of flash <b>flooding.</b> <b>The</b> aforementioned evacuation camps included schools, town halls, and churches. Overall, damage totaled to $63.3million, including $41.8million from infrastructure. Crop damage was minimal, estimated at $10million. Furthermore, 595people were killed because of Irma. Seventy-two others were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Along its path, Japhet dropped heavy {{rainfall}} that caused widespread river <b>flooding.</b> <b>The</b> rains occurred after an extended drought, although excessive precipitation caused heavy crop damage, notably around where the storm moved ashore.

40|$|AbstractLlanos de Moxos are vast plains in the Bolivian Amazonia {{that are}} {{continually}} <b>flooded</b> by <b>the</b> Mamore river. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> lasts {{for several days}} affecting important cities like Trinidad, drowning people, drowning cattle and swamping arable land. Because of the cloudy skies, remote sensing observations are limited to some areas and few days. Thus, there is huge uncertainty about characteristics of flood events and possible consequences. Two-dimensional (2 D) numerical simulation {{proved to be an}} important tool for understanding <b>flood</b> events. <b>The</b> HEC-RAS model {{is one of the most}} popular hydraulic models. In 2014 a new version of HEC-RAS (HEC-RAS-v 5) was released including 2 D capabilities. The present study applied the new HEC-RAS-v 5 to simulate <b>the</b> February 2014 <b>flood</b> event in <b>the</b> Bolivian Amazonia. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> simulated shows good performance when compared with satellite image of <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> event. In addition, the simulation provides information like water depth, flow velocity and a temporal variation of <b>the</b> <b>flood.</b> Specific locations where water begins to overflow were identified. Over most of <b>the</b> <b>flooded</b> area <b>the</b> water velocity is lower than 0. 25 ms− 1. During first ten days of <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> extent increases rapidly. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> depth allows identifying areas exposed to different hazard levels. The west plain of the Mamore river is the most exposed to the flood; it shows bigger flood extent, longer flood duration and deeper water depth. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> that threatens <b>the</b> city of Trinidad originates in two locations; one located 32 km at the north and other located 10 km at the south west. <b>The</b> <b>flood</b> from <b>the</b> north gets close to Trinidad twelve days after it begins to overflow, while <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> from <b>the</b> south gets close to Trinidad seven days after it begins to overflow. Although <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> from <b>the</b> north is deeper than <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> from <b>the</b> south, <b>the</b> <b>flood</b> from <b>the</b> south begins <b>flooded</b> before <b>the</b> north. Thus, water borne and vector borne diseases may originate at the south earlier than the north. The city of San Javier gets covered by flood five days after the water begins to overflow. The study shows the applicability and the value of the 2 D capabilities of the new HEC-RAS for flood studies...|$|R
