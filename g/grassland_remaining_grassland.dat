40|$|Every {{year the}} Norwegian Forest and Landscape Institute submits the {{national}} GHG inventory {{for the land}} use, land-use change and forestry sector {{as part of the}} National Inventory Report (NIR). The methodology and activity data used to estimate CO 2 emissions and removals from cropland and grassland were thoroughly evaluated in 2012 and several new methods were implemented in the 2013 NIR submission. The objective of this report is to present the results of this evaluation and to provide detailed documentation of the new methodologies and the emissions reported in the 2013 NIR submission to UNFCCC for cropland and grassland (CPA, 2013). This report describes four major topics: 1) Method choice for mineral soils. The erosion-based method previously used for mineral soils on both cropland and grassland cannot be considered appropriate. It was replaced by a Tier 2 method for cropland remaining cropland (considering effects of crop rotation, tillage, crop residues and manure inputs) and a Tier 1 method for <b>grassland</b> <b>remaining</b> <b>grassland</b> (considering effects of grassland management practice). 2) Evaluation of the emission factor used for organic soil and the area estimate. A review of Scandinavian literature did not support changing the emission factor value but the areas of cultivated organic soils were re-defined under cropland and grassland. 3) A Tier 1 methodology {{that can be used to}} estimate soil carbon stock changes on land-use conversion to grassland and cropland as well as all other land-use change conversion. 4) Uncertainty estimation for all source/sink categories are presented including the use of IPCC default uncertainty estimates when relevant...|$|E
40|$|We used recent {{satellite}} imagery {{to quantify the}} extent, type, and rate of conversion of <b>remaining</b> indigenous <b>grasslands</b> in the inland eastern South Island of New Zealand in recent years. We describe the pattern of conversion in relation to national classifications of land use capability and land environments, and ecological and administrative districts and regions.

Indigenous grassland was reduced {{in the study area}} by 3 % (70 200 ha) between 1990 and 2008. Almost two-thirds of post- 1990 conversion occurred in threatened environments with less than 30 % of indigenous cover remaining, primarily in the Waitaki, Mackenzie and Central Otago administrative districts. This conversion occurred primarily on non-arable land. In the Mackenzie and Waitaki districts the rate of conversion in 2001 - 2008 was approximately twice that in 1990 - 2001. Opportunities to protect more of the full range of indigenous grasslands lie with the continuing tenure review process in these districts...|$|R

Feely (1985) {{suggested that}} the grasslands are ancient. I therefore used C isotope analysis to reveal whether there has been {{any change in the}} dominant vegetation during the Iron Age period. We measured the δ¹³C value of the soil organic matter taken at various depths These were taken from selected sites throughout Transkei that represented the grasslands, forests and grasslands suspected of once being forest or scrub-forest.

Those area that are presently covered in <b>grasslands</b> have <b>remained</b> <b>grasslands</b> for the time period represented by the depth of the samples taken. There is however a small shift in the forest and grassland sites to a lower isotopic value either as a result of changing vegetation or changes in the atmospheric [O₂]. There is also archaeological, ecological and historical evidence supporting these results. There is evidence of settlements scattered along the coast and in river valleys during the Early Iron Age (AD 300 to AD 1000). The earliest evidence of settlements during the Late Iron Age dates to AD 1400.

40|$|North American {{grassland}}s and grassland {{birds have}} declined drastically due to habitat degradation by fire suppression (i. e., woody encroachment), fragmentation, and conversion to croplands. A better understanding is needed {{of the relationships}} among disturbance regimes (e. g., fire), resultant vegetation changes, and grassland bird communities to effectively manage <b>remaining</b> <b>grasslands</b> and grassland birds. I assessed the relationship between post-fire succession, and mean relative abundance and nesting ecology of breeding grassland birds (i. e., nest-site selection and nest success) in mesquite-dominated rangeland of the Texas Rolling Plains, where prescribed fire {{is used as a}} tool to manage shrub encroachment. Brush cover, grass cover, and visual obstruction generally increased with post-fire succession, and bare ground decreased with post-fire succession. Species richness, grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), Cassin??????s sparrows (Aimophila cassinii), and dickcissels (Spiza americana) responded positively to post-fire succession, and lark sparrows (Chondestes grammacus) responded negatively to post-fire succession.; abundance of these avian groups was low on the control sites. During 2004 ?????? 2005, 90 grassland bird nests were monitored. I found conflicting results for vegetation parameters important to nest site selection and probability of nest success. For all species except lark sparrows, nest-site location was positively associated with visual obstruction and with grass or forb cover. However, the probability of nest success increased with lower visual obstruction, bare ground cover, or grass cover. Grassland bird abundance, nest-site location, and nest success had differing associations with vegetation variables. These results suggest that to effectively manage <b>remaining</b> <b>grasslands</b> for sustainable breeding grassland bird populations, managers should engage in practices that keep habitat in multiple vegetative successional stages...|$|R

30|$|Esler ([1967]) {{regarded}} {{the effects of}} grazing in the conversion of grassland to shrubland on Kapiti Island as diverse. Grazing either accelerates or retards succession of woody species depending on certain other site factors and can also determine which species are likely to succeed. He found that small areas of <b>grassland</b> <b>remained</b> on parts of Kapiti Island where heavy grazing occurred or {{where there was no}} grazing at all. Intensive grazing of pasture on fertile soils retarded the appearance of woody species but on other sites the invasion of manuka and kanuka ceased when sheep and goats were removed due the development of a dense deep turf. In management of hill country for pasture, intensity of grazing is a major factor in succession of woody species (Levy [1970]). Sheep and cattle grazing have different effects on reversion of hill country to woody species. Intense close grazing by sheep leads to invasion of manuka, hard fern and rushes whereas controlled grazing with cattle will maintain a permanent sward provided that clovers are kept growing strongly by applications of phosphate (ibid).|$|R

40|$|Remote sensing, {{when used}} in {{conjunction}} with landscape pattern metrics, is a powerful method for the study of ecological dynamics at the landscape scale by means of multi-temporal analysis. In this paper, we examine temporal change in open formations in the natural reserve of Poggio all’Olmo (central Italy). This area has undergone rural depopulation and the cessation of traditional methods of agriculture, resulting in the subsequent re-establishment and spread of other vegetation formations. Aerial photographs taken in 1954, 1977 and 1998 were orthorectified and classified based on the physiognomic characteristics of the vegetation. An objective definition of the minimum mapping unit (MMU) was guaranteed by using vector format grids for this classification. We applied landscape pattern metrics based on landscape composition, the shape and size of patches and patch isolation. Our results demonstrate the key roles of shrubland, woodland and coniferous plantations in the ongoing fragmentation of open formations in the landscape. Multi-temporal landscape analyses, and, in particular, a restricted suite of landscape metrics, proved useful for detecting and quantitatively characterizing dynamic ecological processes.

Grasslands are the potential natural vegetation of approximately 25 percent of the land surface of the earth, or 35 X 106 Km 2 km 2 (Shantz 1954, Graetz 1994). These are systems mostly limited by water, which are domi-nated by grasses and have a variable woody component. Humans utilize these areas as grazing lands or transform them into croplands depending mostly on water availability and the amount of subsidies received by agri-culture in each individual country. Most of the mesic grasslands have been converted into agricultural land, whereas a large fraction of the arid and semi-arid <b>grasslands</b> <b>remain</b> as such. Subsidies to agriculture make trans-formation of grasslands into croplands economically feasible in regions that otherwise would <b>remain</b> as native <b>grasslands,</b> such as the western portion of the North American Great Plains (Hannah et al. 1995). Grasslands produce an array of goods and services for humankind, but only a few of them have market value.

Simultaneously, grassland ecosystems confer to humans many other vital and often unrecognized services such as maintenance of the com-position of the atmosphere, maintenance of the genetic library, amelioration of weather, and conservation of soils.

40|$|With under 1500 ha {{of species}} rich flood-plain meadows (Alopecurus - Sanguisorba MG 4 <b>grassland)</b> <b>remaining</b> in England and Wales {{there is a}} great {{potential}} for restoration to re-establish and extend areas of this habitat. Restoration has conventionally considered only the plant communities that define these flood-plain meadows; however there are many other biotic and abiotic elements that must be considered if restoration is to be successful. In this paper we consider how restoration management used during the re-establishment of such flood-plain meadows will affect not only the plant, but also a dominant component of the invertebrate communities, the beetles. While both the plants and beetles benefit from hay cut followed by aftermath grazing, there is evidence that beetle communities lag behind the plants in the success achieved during restoration. We attribute this to fundamental differences in the way establishment of plants and beetles are promoted during restoration, specifically that the plants are artificially introduced as seed, whereas colonisation by beetles is by natural immigration. We suggest that this may have important long term consequences for restoration, namely that while a restored grassland may show strong floristic similarity to that of target flood-plain meadows, such similarity may be superficial and not seen for other trophic levels...|$|R
