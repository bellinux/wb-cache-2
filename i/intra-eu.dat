25|$|By 2009 Mexico ranked {{once again}} number 15 on World's leading {{exporters}} with US $230billion (And amongst {{the top ten}} excluding <b>Intra-EU</b> countries). Mexican trade is fully integrated with that of its North American partners: close to 90% of Mexican exports and 50% of its imports are traded with the United States and Canada. Nonetheless, NAFTA has not produced trade diversion. While trade with the United States increased 183% from 1993 to 2002, and that with Canada 165%, other trade agreements have shown even more impressive results: trade with Chile increased 285%, with Costa Rica 528% and Honduras 420%. Trade with the European Union increased 105% over the same time period.|$|E
25|$|EU as a {{security}} provider: Management of post Soviet-er{{a security}} tensions in bordering States (Ukraine, Georgia and Balkan States) has exposed deep-rooted structural weaknesses of European Union institutions. European Union's collective response on matters ranging from {{the management of the}} exodus of refugees from war-torn Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, participation in NATO-led interventions, action against non-State entities (Islamic State & Al-Qaeda), etc. suffers from differing priorities of 28 European Union member States. The paucity of strategic vision within the European Council, nationality-quota based allotment of senior bureaucratic positions within the Institutions of the European Union, and the capacity of minor European countries to unduly influence policy choices of the European Union is problematic. Decision taking by Brussels-based European stake-holders is cumbersome and severely limited due to <b>intra-EU</b> politics and the obsession with Byzantine Community method consensus-based decision making procedures. The Ukrainian crisis exposed the shortcomings of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and outlined the limits of German military clout. Public disenchantment with the political outcomes of recent military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya has emptied political support for accrued European Union involvement in the Syrian and Ukrainian crisis. Further strengthening of European Union sanctions regime against Russia faces internal dissent from several EU member States (Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Finland) besides being largely ignored by European multinationals (German and Italian companies have most investment exposure in Russia) who bypass the sanctions regime by trading with Russia via third-countries (Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Israel). A 2015 Pew Research survey indicated that Europeans are by and large not favourable to a military deployment by their country under the terms of NATO Article 5 to protect a fellow member country which comes under attack.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{national}} identity cards issued {{in other parts}} of the EU, an Irish passport card cannot be issued unless the bearer already has a valid passport booklet but, because of its convenient size and durable format compared to the Irish passport booklet, it will also serve purposes similar to that of {{national identity}} cards {{in other parts of}} the EU: identity and age verification, and <b>intra-EU</b> travel.|$|E

Silja Line gradually reduced the traffic from Jakobstad and Kokkola. Due to {{a part of the}} deal when Vasabåtarna bought Jakob Lines, Silja was obliged to maintain summer traffic from Jakobstad until tax-free sales were abolished on <b>intra-EU</b> travel in 1999.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} state {{aid in the}} European Union came from Article 87(2) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade where it states that state aid was aid [...] "granted by a Member State or through state {{resources}} in any form whatsoever". Because of the broad wording of the agreement, the European Court of Justice interpreted it as being that the state would [...] "confer assistance or advantage to specific undertakings", which they ruled would be undue influence on <b>intra-EU</b> trade.|$|E
5000|$|In 1986, {{the company}} added a second route - flying Dublin-Luton in direct {{competition}} with the Aer Lingus / British Airways duopoly for the first time. Under partial EU deregulation, airlines could begin new international <b>intra-EU</b> services, as long as {{at least one of}} the two governments gave approval (the so-called [...] "double-disapproval" [...] regime). The Irish government at the time refused its approval, to protect Aer Lingus, but Britain, under Margaret Thatcher's deregulating Conservative government, approved the service. With two routes and two planes, the fledgling airline carried 82,000 passengers in one year.|$|E

50|$|At EU level, the European Commission, in {{particular}} the Directorate General for Trade, {{plays a role in}} the harmonization of Export Credit Agencies and the co-ordination of policy statements and negotiation positions. This is based on council decisions 73/391/EEC and 76/641/EEC. These decisions provide for prior consultations among member states on long term export credits. Member states may ask each other if they are considering to finance a specific transaction with official export credit support. EU members may not subsidize <b>intra-EU</b> export credits. The application of the OECD arrangement in providing export credit is mandatory in EU countries under Art. 1 of Regulation (EU) No. 1233/2011.|$|E
50|$|In 1997 the Kokkola-Skellefteå route was reopened, {{although}} {{traffic was}} limited to weekends during the summer season. In 1998 the traffic from Kokkola was again discontinued (this time for good), but Fennia continued to traffic on the Vaasa-Umeå, Jakobstad-Umeå and Jakobstad-Skellefteå routes. A special Jakobstand-Luleå cruise was also made during the summer. In May and June 1999 Fennia trafficked from Jakobstad for the last time, the end of tax-free sales in <b>intra-EU</b> traffic in July 1999 meant that the traffic from Jakobstad was no longer profitable. The end of Tax-Free sales also affected the Vaasa-Umeå route badly, and on 23 September 1999 Fennia was laid up and put for sale.|$|E
