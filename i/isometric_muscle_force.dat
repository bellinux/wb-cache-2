40|$|Abstract Background Isometric force {{measurements}} in {{the lower}} extremity are widely used in rehabilitation of subjects with neurological movement disorders (NMD) because walking ability {{has been shown to}} be related to muscle strength. Therefore muscle strength measurements can be used to monitor and control the effects of training programs. A new method to assess <b>isometric</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>force</b> was implemented in the driven gait orthosis (DGO) Lokomat. To evaluate the capabilities of this new measurement method, inter- and intra-rater reliability were assessed. Methods Reliability was assessed in subjects with and without NMD. Subjects were tested twice on the same day by two different therapists to test inter-rater reliability and on two separate days by the same therapist to test intra-rater reliability. Results Results showed fair to good reliability for the new measurement method to assess <b>isometric</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>force</b> of lower extremities. In subjects without NMD, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for inter-rater reliability ranged from 0. 72 to 0. 97 and intra-rater reliability from 0. 71 to 0. 90. In subjects with NMD, ICC ranged from 0. 66 to 0. 97 for inter-rater and from 0. 50 to 0. 96 for intra-rater reliability. Conclusion Inter- and intra- rater reliability of an assessment method for measuring maximal voluntary <b>isometric</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>force</b> of lower extremities was demonstrated. We suggest that this method is a valuable tool for documentation and controlling of the rehabilitation process in patients using a DGO. </p...|$|E

40|$|As a {{first step}} towards the {{integration}} of information on neural control, biomechanics and isolated muscle function, we constructed a three-dimensional musculo-skeletal model of the hind leg of the death-head cockroach Blaberus discoidalis. We tested the model by measuring the maximum force generated in vivo by the hind leg of the cockroach, the coxa–femur joint angle and the position of this leg during a behavior, wedging, that was likely to require maximum torque or moment production. The product of the maximum force of the leg and its moment arm yielded a measured coxa–femur joint moment for wedging behavior. The maximum musculo-apodeme moment predicted by summing all extensor muscle moments in the model was adequate to explain {{the magnitude of the}} coxa–femur joint moment produced in vivo by the cockroach and occurred at the same joint angle measured during wedging.

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of tendinopathy {{in the upper}} limbs has been assumed to be approximately 10 %, with the shoulder most frequently affected. Studies have shown a relation between pain, strength reduction and disability in patients with rotatorcuff tendinopathy. Accurate and objective outcome measures are essential for reliable diagnostics. Quantification of muscle force and pain threshold might contribute to more precise diagnostics of shoulder disorders. Research question: What is the statistical relation between mechanical tendon pain pressure measured with analogous algometry and isometric pain-free muscle force measured with handheld dynamometry in patients with rotatorcuff tendinopathy? Methods: Cross-sectional study with a correlation analysis of tendon pain pressure and <b>isometric</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>force.</b> Spearman's rho {{was used to evaluate}} covariation. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used to analyse group differences. A secondary analysis was performed with data obtained from an ongoing randomized controlled trial. Result: Algometry- and dynamometry measurements from each tendon were compared in both symptomatic and asymptomatic shoulder (n = 20). A moderate to high positive correlation was found for supraspinatus, subscapularis and infraspinatus r = 0, 493, r = 0, 487, r = 0, 744 respectively. A statistically significant difference was found between symptomatic and asymptomatic tendons measured with <b>isometric</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>force.</b> With the exception of supraspinatus there was a statistically significant difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic tendon measured with tendon pain pressure.

40|$|Background: Previous {{musculoskeletal}} modeling {{studies have}} adopted the assumption of the same maximum isometric muscle stress among the prime elbow flexors. This study aimed at estimating the maximum isometric muscle stress based on subject-specific modeling parameters measured in vivo and validating that assumption. Methods: Subject-specific musculoskeletal models of the upper limbs of five normal subjects were developed, which incorporated anthropometrically scaled graphics-based geometrical models and Hill-type musculotendon models of the prime elbow flexors. B-mode ultrasound technique was employed to measure the muscle optimal length and pennation angle of each prime elbow flexor, and these architectural parameters were inputted into the model {{to reduce the number}} of unknown parameters to be optimized. To allow changes of individual maximum <b>isometric</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>force</b> of the prime elbow flexors, optimizations were conducted by minimizing the root mean square difference between the predicted and measured isometric torque-angle curves. Maximum isometric muscle stress of each prime elbow flexor was estimated by dividing the maximum <b>isometric</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>force</b> with the corresponding physiological cross-sectional area. Findings: Our findings showed that maximum isometric muscle stress among the prime elbow flexors was not significantly different from each other. Thus it appears that it is reasonable to assume the same value for maximum isometric muscle stress for all prime elbow flexors in musculoskeletal modeling studies. Interpretation: Latest medical imaging techniques such as ultrasound for the estimation of musculotendon parameters would provide an alterative method to obtain the muscle architecture parameters noninvasively. The subject-specific musculotendon parameters estimated in this study could be used for developing the neuromusculoskeletal model to predict muscle force and evaluate muscle functions.

40|$|Muscle fatigue is a {{temporary}} decline in the force and power capacity of skeletal muscle resulting from muscle activity. Because control of muscle is realized {{at the level of}} the motor unit (MU), it seems important to consider the physiological properties of motor units when attempting to understand and predict muscle fatigue. Therefore, we developed a phenomenological model of motor unit fatigue as a tractable means to predict muscle fatigue for a variety of tasks and to illustrate the individual contractile responses of MUs whose collective action determines the trajectory of changes in <b>muscle</b> <b>force</b> capacity during prolonged activity. An existing MU population model was used to simulate MU firing rates and <b>isometric</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>forces</b> and, to that model, we added fatigue-related changes in MU force, contraction time, and firing rate associated with sustained voluntary contractions. The model accurately estimated endurance times for sustained isometric contractions across a wide range of target levels. In addition, simulations were run for situations that have little experimental precedent to demonstrate the potential utility of the model to predict motor unit fatigue for more complicated, real-world applications. Moreover, the model provided insight into the complex orchestration of MU force contributions during fatigue, that would be unattainable with current experimental approaches...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A major {{challenge}} in controlling multiple-input multiple output functional electrical stimulation systems {{is the large}} amount of time required to identify a workable system model due to the high dimensionality of the space of inputs. To address this challenge we are exploring optimal methods to sample the input space. In this paper we present two methods for optimally sampling <b>isometric</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>force</b> recruitment curves. One method maximizes the information about the recruitment curve parameters, and the second method minimizes the average variance of the predicted output force. We compared these methods to two previously-used methods in simulation. The simulation model was identified from re-cruitment data collected during experiments with a human subject with a high spinal cord injury. The optimal sampling methods on average produced estimates of the output force with less error than the two previously-used methods. The optimal sampling methods require fewer system identification experiments to identify models with similar output prediction accuracy. I...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The squat {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} exercises in athletic training. However, there is a scarcity of research that reports the muscular and joint loads in the lumbar region incurred when performing the high bar and the low bar isometric squat modalities in a Smith machine. Therefore, this study aims to determine the <b>muscle</b> <b>force</b> of the lower back extensors, and the compressive (Rc) and shear (Rs) forces at the lumbosacral joint for the one repetition maximum (1 RM) high bar and low bar isometric parallel-depth Smith squats. Methods: Eight healthy male well-trained 400 -m sprinters participated in the study. The athletes performed the two modalities of the isometric squat on a 7 ° backward-inclined Smith machine using a mean ± SD 1 RM external resistance of 100. 3 ± 7. 2 kg. During the squat, the participants paused for 2 - 3 s at the bottom of the squat, corresponding to a position in which the thighs are parallel to the ground. This was, therefore, considered a static position for the calculation of <b>isometric</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>forces</b> and joint loads using static mechanical analysis. Moment arms, and joint and segmental angles were calculated from video images of the squatting performance. Internal forces were computed using a geometrical model of the trunk and lower limb. Results: Spinal extensor muscular forces and lumbo-sacral joint forces were higher when using the low bar technique; with the exception of Rs which was approximately equal. The mean Rc were 10. 2 body weights (BW) or 8, 014 N (high bar) and 11. 1 BW or 8, 729 N (low bar). Discussion: The low bar technique yields higher Rc and may therefore be avoided in the rehabilitation of spinal injuries. Increased bone mineral density and well-developed trunk musculature due to long term squat training can provide protection against passive spinal tissue failure. Therefore, the Rc found for the 1 RM isometric parallel-depth Smith squat do not appear excessive for healthy well-trained athletes. The presence of Rs at the lumbo-sacral joint in both squat modalities suggests potential for damage to the intervertebral disc. The findings provide an in-depth understanding of the two squat modalities in isometric conditions for the prevention of lower back injury and the design of rehabilitation programs...|$|R
40|$|Effects on {{force of}} {{changes of the}} {{position}} of extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL) relative to surrounding tissues were investigated in rat. Connective tissue at the muscle bellies of tibialis anterior (TA), extensor hallucis longus (EHL) and EDL was left intact, to allow myofascial force transmission. The position of EDL muscle was altered, without changing EDL muscle-tendon complex length, and force exerted at proximal and distal tendons of EDL as well as summed force exerted at the distal tendons of TA and EHL muscles (TA+EHL) were measured. Proximal and distal EDL forces as well as distal TA+EHL force changed significantly on repositioning EDL muscle. These muscle position-force characteristics were assessed at two EDL lengths and two TA+EHL lengths. It was shown that changes of muscle force with length changes of a muscle {{is the result of the}} length changes per se, as well as of changes of relative position of parts of the muscle.

Twelve healthy subjects (11 males and 1 female, mean age 31. 1 ± 8. 7 years) were instructed to perform isometric maximum voluntary contractions of wrist flexors and extensors.

The model was validated and the RMSE and the normalised RMSE calculated during estimation and validation phases are compared. Estimated subject-specific musculoskeletal parameters vary in a physiologically realistic range, while the biomechanical indexes are consistent with previously published data.

40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of peripheral nerve {{results in a}} motor-unit recruitment order opposite to that attained by natural neural control, i. e. from large, fast-fatiguing to progressively smaller, fatigue-resistant motor-units. Yet animal studies involving physiological exercise protocols of low intensity and long duration require minimal fatigue. The present study sought to apply a nerve stimulation method to selectively recruit smaller motor-units in rat skeletal muscle. Two pulse generators were used, independently supplying short supramaximal cathodal stimulating pulses (0. 5 ms) and long subthreshold cathodal inactivating pulses (1. 5 s) to the sciatic nerve. Propagation of action potentials was selectively blocked in nerve fibres of different diameter by adjusting {{the strength of the}} inactivating current. A tensile-testing machine was used to gauge <b>isometric</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>force</b> of the plantaris and both heads of the gastrocnemius muscle. The order of motor-unit recruitment was estimated from twitch characteristics, i. e. peak force and relaxation time.

40|$|Introduction: The back squat is {{a popular}} {{strength}} training exercise that recruits approximately 75 % of the muscular system. However, knowledge of muscular and joint loads incurred when performing two variations of the back squat, namely the high bar and the low bar isometric parallel-depth Smith squat, is limited. Therefore, this study aims to determine the lower limb <b>muscle</b> <b>forces</b> and the compressive and shear joint forces at the knee and ankle incurred in these two subtle variations of the one repetition maximum (1 RM) isometric Smith squat. Method: Eight healthy male 400 -m sprinters participated in the study. The participants performed the two modalities of the squat using a 7 ° backward-inclined Smith machine. The bottom of the squat corresponded to a position in which the thighs are parallel to the ground. The mean ± SD 1 RM external load for the eight participants was 100. 3 ± 7. 2 kg. During the squat, the participants paused for 2 - 3 s {{at the bottom of}} the squat. This was, therefore, considered a static position for the calculation of <b>isometric</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>forces</b> and joint loads using static mechanical analysis. Moment arms, and joint and segmental angles were calculated from video images of the squat obtained at 25 Hz. Internal forces were computed using a geometrical model of the lower limb. Results: Quadriceps muscle and knee joint forces were higher in the high bar squat; where, the mean patello- femoral joint reaction force was 3. 7 body weights (BW). The ankle extensor muscle and ankle joint forces were larger in the low bar squat; whereby, the mean compressive force at the ankle joint was 3. 0 BW. Discussion: The high bar squatting modality may be avoided in the rehabilitation of ACL injury. Conversely, the low bar technique may be discouraged in conditions of ankle joint instability, strained Achilles tendon, and damaged gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. The findings of the static biomechanical evaluation provide an in-depth understanding of the musculoskeletal loads associated with the two squat modalities in isometric conditions and offer a foundation for the dynamic modelling of the high bar and low bar Smith squat. Further, the knowledge gained can be used for the prevention of injury in strength training and in the design of rehabilitation programs that control muscle recruitment and joint loads...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — EMG-to-force {{estimation}} for {{voluntary muscle}} contraction has many applications in human-machine interaction, motion analysis, and rehabilitation robotics for prosthetic limbs or exoskeletons. EMG-based model {{can account for}} a subject’s individual activation patterns to estimate <b>muscle</b> <b>force.</b> For the estimation, so-called Hill-type model {{has been used in}} most of the cases.

We have already developed the physiological based muscle model for the use of functional electrical stimulation (FES) which can render the myoelectrical property also in microscopic scale. In this paper we discuss EMG-to-force estimation based on this full physiological based muscle model in voluntary contraction. In addition to Hill macroscopic structure, a microscopic physiology originally designed by Huxley is integrated. It has significant meaning to realize the same kind of EMG-toforce estimation with a physiological based model not with a phenomenological model, because it brings the understanding of the internal biophysical dynamics and new insights about neuromuscular activations.

Two of the most active hits obtained were methazolamide and dichlorphenamide, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors widely used in human therapy. In C. elegans, these drugs were shown to interact with CAH- 4, a putative carbonic anhydrase. The therapeutic efficacy of these compounds was further validated in long-term experiments on mdx mice, the mouse model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

The derivation of this energetic–viscoelastic model is described by a 3 rst-order linear ordinary di 2 erential equation with constant energetic and viscoelastic coe 5 cients. The model has been implemented as part of a biomimetic model, which describes the excitation–contraction coupling necessary to drive the energetic–viscoelastic model. Finally, the energetic–viscoelastic model is validated by comparing its isometric force–time pro 3 le with that of various muscles reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|K+ channel {{blockers}} like 3, 4 -diaminopyridine (DAP) {{can double}} <b>isometric</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>force.</b> Functional movements require more complex concentric and eccentric contractions, however {{the effects of}} K+ channel blockade on these types of contractions in situ are unknown. Extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were stimulated in situ with and without DAP in anesthetized rats and fatigability was addressed using a series of either concentric or eccentric contractions. During isotonic protocols (5 - 100 % load), DAP significantly shifted shortening- and maximum shortening velocity-load curves upward {{and to the right}} and increased power and work. Maximum shortening, maximum shortening velocity and power doubled while work increased by approximately 250 % during isotonic contraction at 50 % load. During isotonic fatigue, DAP significantly augmented maximum shortening, work, shortening velocity and power. During constant velocity eccentric protocols (2 - 12 mm/s), DAP increased muscle force during eccentric contractions at 6, 8, 10 and 12 mm/s. During eccentric contraction at a constant velocity of 6 mm/s while varying the stimulation frequency, DAP significantly increased muscle force during 20, 40 and 70 Hz. The effects of DAP on muscle contractile performance during eccentric fatigue varied with level of fatigue. DAP-induced contractile increases during isotonic contractions were similar to those produced during previously studied isometric contractions, while the DAP effect during eccentric contractions was more modest. These findings are especially important in attempting to optimize functional electrical stimulation parameters for spinal cord injury patients while also preventing rapid fatigue of those muscles...|$|E
40|$|Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is an {{inherited}} muscle degeneration disease {{for which there}} is still no efficient treatment. However, compounds active on the disease may already exist among approved drugs but are difficult to identify in the absence of cellular models. We used the Caenorhabditis elegans animal model to screen a collection of 1000 already approved compounds. Two of the most active hits obtained were methazolamide and dichlorphenamide, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors widely used in human therapy. In C. elegans, these drugs were shown to interact with CAH- 4, a putative carbonic anhydrase. The therapeutic efficacy of these compounds was further validated in long-term experiments on mdx mice, the mouse model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Mice were treated for 120 days with food containing methazolamide or dichlorphenamide at two doses each. Musculus tibialis anterior and diaphragm muscles were histologically analyzed and <b>isometric</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>force</b> was measured in M. extensor digitorum longus. Both substances increased the tetanic muscle force in the treated M. extensor digitorum longus muscle group, dichlorphenamide increased the force significantly by 30 %, but both drugs failed to increase resistance of muscle fibres to eccentric contractions. Histological analysis revealed a reduction of centrally nucleated fibers in M. tibialis anterior and diaphragm in the treated groups. These studies further demonstrated that a C. elegans-based screen coupled with a mouse model validation strategy can lead to the identification of potential pharmacological agents for rare diseases...|$|E
40|$|During {{voluntary}} jaw clenching, a sharp tap to the menton of the mandible {{resulted in}} a tran-sitory silent period (pause) in the electromyo-graphic activity of the masseter and anterior temporalis muscles. Factors that could influ-ence {{the duration of the}} silent period were studied, including direction and magnitude of the stimulus applied by the operator, the amount of muscular effort exerted by the sub-jects, and varying occlusal vertical dimensions. Decreased <b>isometric</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>force</b> resulted in statistically significant increases in silent period durations. J Dent Res 56 (6) : 660 - 664 June 1977. The electromyographic (EMG) silent period phenomenon was first reported for human sub-jects by Hoffmann, ' and was explained as cen-tral refractoriness of the motor neurons due to a superimposed reflex twitch on the contrac-tion of a muscle. The jaw-jerk is a myotactic reflex that is activated by sudden stretching of the muscle spindles in the jaw-closing mus-cles. 2 Afferent nerve fibers from these muscle spindles run in the motor root of the trigeminal nerve, whereas the fibers of the Golgi tendon organs run together with other V nerve affer-ents in the sensory root. Surgical cutting of the sensory root for patients with trigeminal neu-ralgia will eliminate the inhibitory polysynap-tic reflexes including the effects of the tension-sensitive Golgi organs. 3 This results in the persistence of the jaw-jerk reflex; however, the EMG silent period that followed had a signifi-This investigation was supported by USPHS Gran...|$|E
40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{relationship between}} lumbar myoelectric signals (MES) and rapidly varying <b>isometric</b> trunk <b>muscle</b> <b>forces</b> was investigated. Ten young adult males {{were asked to}} cycle harmonically between attempted trunk flexion and attempted trunk extension in an upright position at rates of 0. 33, 0. 67 and 1. 0 Hz to peak efforts of 20, 40 and 60 % of maximum voluntary exertion levels. The forces voluntarily exerted against a load cell were measured and used along with acquired kinematic data to calculate {{the time course of}} the net sagittal moment {{at the level of the}} third lumbar vertebra during task performances. A 22 muscle double linear programming biomechanical model was used to predict the lumbar trunk <b>muscle</b> contraction <b>forces</b> from the calculated moments. Rectified and bidirectionally low-pass filtered myoelectric activities were acquired at the L 3 level from four abdominal muscles and four back muscles. The processed MES were found to be well correlated (r> 0. 90) with predicted <b>muscle</b> <b>forces</b> when the MES were time-shifted to account for electromechanical delay as well as the dynamic phase shift between muscle electrical activity and contraction force. Mean time shifts that maximized the linear MES-force relationship ranged from 111 to 218 ms, were greater for the trunk extensors than the trunk flexors and generally exhibited lateral symmetry. The corresponding approximate phase angles averaged 20 [deg] at the slowest rate and 50 [deg] at the fastest rate. MES-force phase angles decreased as effort level was increased indicating that the dynamic MES-force relationship is nonlinear. These results illustrate the importance of accounting for the phase lag between muscle electrical activity and force when using MES to quantify muscle loads during rapidly varying exertions...|$|R

40|$|In {{the paper}} a static {{analysis}} of two-fingered grips is presented. Importance of grasp analysis in human performance engineering and hand therapy is discussed and assessment methods are proposed. Two precision grips {{were examined in}} the study: nippers pinch and tip pinch. We have built a grip-measuring device assessing the endpoint forces of two-oppositional grips. The instrument developed {{is based on a}} robotic force-wrist sensor and designed to suit human fingers. Through the simultaneous use of an optical measuring system and the grip-measuring device, the finger positions and the grip force acting on the object were obtained. A static model of the hand was also developed. A recursive computational method was used to calculate the joint torques of the fingers from the measured coordinates and the endpoint force vector. The estimated joint torque corresponds to the amount of load on the tendon during <b>isometric</b> <b>muscle</b> contraction. The <b>force</b> output of the two grips considered is presented and compared in two healthy individuals.
