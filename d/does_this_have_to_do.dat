We may not know what these are yet, {{but that does not}} stop us from asking a number of {{questions}} about them. Example 1. 1. The cube and the octahedron. The cube has 8 vertices, 12 edges and 6 faces, while the octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges and 8 faces. Is this reversal in the number of faces in each dimension common? In the problem session you saw that v-e+f= 2 for 3 -polytopes. Is something similar true in higher dimensions? Are there other restrictions on the number of faces of each dimension? What is the most number of faces in each dimension if we fix the number of vertices and dimension? The least? What if we fix other numbers of faces in random dimensions? Notice that all of these questions involve counting faces of various dimensions. Another situation where these types of questions occur comes is hyperplane ar-rangements. A hyperplane of R d is any set of the form l − 1 v (c) = {x: v · x = c}, where v is a fixed vector in R d and c ∈ R. Consider the arrangement of 5 lines in Figure 1. How are they different? How are they the same? Is there a connection between hyperplane arrangements and polytopes? An apparently unrelated topic [...] . Let G be an undirected graph.

In single-blind reviewing, the reviewer is unknown to the author, but the identity of the author is known to the reviewer. Double-blind reviewing is more symmetric: The identity of the author and the reviewer are not revealed to each other. We first examine the significant scholarly literature regarding blind reviewing. We then list six benefits claimed for double-blind reviewing and 21 possible costs. To compare these benefits and costs, we propose a double-blind policy for TODS that attempts to minimize the costs while retaining the core benefit of fairness that double-blind reviewing provides, and evaluate that policy against each of the listed benefits and costs. Following that is a general discussion considering several questions: What <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with TODS, does bias exist in computer science, and what is the appropriate decision procedure?
