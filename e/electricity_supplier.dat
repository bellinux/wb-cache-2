5|$|Power {{and water}} schemes were {{expanded}} {{to be able}} to cope with the industrial development occurring. The state was at a disadvantage in that it was completely reliant on imports for its fuel supply. South Australia's near-monopoly <b>electricity</b> <b>supplier,</b> the Adelaide Electricity Supply Company (AESC), was reluctant to build up coal reserves in case of a transportation problem. They ran on coal that was shipped over from New South Wales (NSW), where the mines were inefficient and plagued by communist-agitated industrial strife. Playford demanded that supplies be built up so the factories could keep producing; he managed to secure eight months worth of coal reserves from NSW, but even that began to dwindle due to the continued industrial action. Coal supplies were ordered from South Africa in desperation, at Playford's behest. The frustration he experienced while dealing with the AESC would later prove disastrous to the company as the Premier took action against them.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to extreme}} weather {{conditions}} and its lack of interconnections, the Faroe Islands experience one to three total blackouts annually, a ratio {{higher than that of}} continental Europe. The municipality-owned company SEV is the main <b>electricity</b> <b>supplier</b> in the Faroe Islands with 97% of the total production, with private producers supplying the rest.|$|E
30|$|Communication between energy {{suppliers}} and consumers is important.

25|$|The National Grid {{was not as}} {{developed}} {{as it is now}} and so the Corporation set out to generate the required current - the Corporation became the local domestic and industrial <b>electricity</b> <b>supplier.</b> A power station was built for Sheffield Corporation Tramways on Kelham Island by the river Don between Mowbray Street and Alma Street. Feeder cables stretched from there to the extremities of the system, covering over 40 miles of route.|$|E
25|$|Koeberg {{nuclear power}} station is a {{nuclear power station}} in South Africa It is {{currently}} {{the only one in}} the country, and the only one on the entire African continent. It is located 30km north of Cape Town, near Melkbosstrand on the west coast of South Africa. Koeberg is owned and operated by the country's only national <b>electricity</b> <b>supplier,</b> Eskom. The two reactors form the cornerstone of the South African nuclear program.|$|E
25|$|Line D, today's U8, was {{intended}} to run directly under Dresdner Straße via Oranienplatz to Kottbusser Tor. This segment of tunnel was abandoned in favour of a slightly less direct route {{in order to provide}} the former Wertheim department store at Moritzplatz with a direct connection. This involved the construction of a 90-degree curve of the line between Moritzplatz and Kottbusser Tor stations. The construction of the tunnel under Dresdner Straße had only been partially completed before abandonment, leaving it with only one track. This tunnel is separated into three parts, as it was blocked by a concrete wall where it crossed the border between East and West Berlin. Another concrete wall separates this tunnel, which now houses a transformer for an <b>electricity</b> <b>supplier,</b> from the never-completed Oranienplatz Station which is located partially under the square of the same name.|$|E
50|$|In August 2007, the UK Government held a {{consultation}} on smart meter roll-out. The consultation attached the necessary draft regulations and proposed that from 2008 domestic customers provide comparative historical consumption data and <b>electricity</b> <b>suppliers</b> provide a real-time display unit within time limits; and, for business, gas and <b>electricity</b> <b>suppliers</b> install smart meters in {{those parts of}} the SME sector, where it {{has been shown to be}} cost-effective to do so and where such a meter is not already installed.|$|R

25|$|Most meters using Economy 7 {{switch the}} entire {{electricity}} {{supply to the}} cheaper rate during the 7 hour night time period, not just the storage heater circuit. The downside {{of this is that}} the daytime rate per kWh is significantly higher, and that standing charges are sometimes higher. For example, as of July 2017, normal ("single rate") electricity costs 17.14p per kWh in the London region on the standard default tariff for EDF Energy (the post-privatisation incumbent <b>electricity</b> <b>supplier</b> in London), with a standing charge of 18.90p per day. The equivalent Economy 7 costs are 21.34p per kWh during the peak usage period with 7.83p per kWh during the off-peak usage period, and a standing charge of 18.90p per day. Timer switches installed on washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers and immersion heaters may be set so that they only switch on during the off-peak usage period.|$|E
2500|$|Electricity meters are {{required}} to register the energy consumed within an acceptable degree of accuracy. [...] Any significant error in the registered energy can represent a loss to the <b>electricity</b> <b>supplier,</b> or the consumer being over billed. [...] The accuracy is generally laid down in statute for the location in which the meter is installed. [...] Statutory provisions should also specify a procedure to be followed should the accuracy be disputed.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe examine if the Nordic power market, Nord Pool, {{has been}} {{competitive}} or if <b>electricity</b> <b>suppliers</b> have had market power. Specifically, since the evolution from national markets to a multi-national and largely deregulated power market {{has taken place}} stepwise, we also examine how the degree of market power has evolved during this integration process.
