40|$|The {{composition}} of the free amino acid pool in embryonic cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) cotyledons is quite distinct from that of endosperm, and that of germinated, greened cotyledons is quite distinct from that of leaves. During germination (including the precocious germination of immature seeds), the pool expands considerably showing a pronounced accumulation of asparagine. The high level of asparagine found in seedling roots and in the cotyledon vascular exudate indicates {{that this is the}} major transported amino acid in germination. There is no pool expansion in the presence of abscisic acid. In the presence of actinomycin D, the pool expands, but an enormous accumulation of glutamine takes place. The {{composition of}} the pool at any stage is not related to the {{composition of the}} <b>isoacceptor</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> pool, nor to the composition of the storage protein. Anaerobiosis leads to an accumulation of aspartate, alanine, and glycine at the expense of asparagine; however, desiccation does not result in an accumulation of proline. Conspicuously high levels of arginine are maintained through embryogenesis and germination. The levels of individual amino acids are presented as nanomol per cotyledon pair and as per cent of total pool...|$|E

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of 14 C- 2 -mevalonic acid into <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> and ribosomal RNA (high molecular weight RNA) in rapidly growing, cytokinin-dependent tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var. Wisconsin No. 38) callus cultures has been investigated. Approximately 40 % {{of the label}} incorporated into <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> was present in a ribonucleoside with chromatographic properties identical to those of cis-ribosylzeatin. The remainder of the label in the <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> appears to be nonspecific incorporation resulting from degradation and metabolism of 14 C- 2 -mevalonic acid by the tobacco callus tissue. Although the total radioactivity incorporated into ribosomal RNA was roughly {{the same as in}} <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA,</b> the specific radioactivity of the <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> was about four times higher than that of the ribosomal RNA, and the ribosomal RNA labeling could be distinguished from the cytokinin labeling observed in <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA.</b> The distributions of the 14 C- 2 -mevalonic acid label and cytokinin activity in tobacco callus <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> fractionated by benzoylated diethylaminoethylcellulose chromatography indicate that at least two cytokinin-containing <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> species are present in this tissue...|$|R

RNAs isolated from A. bisulcatus seedlings incubated {{in the presence of}} 75 Se indicate some incorporation of radioactivity into the <b>transfer</b> <b>RNAs,</b> but at extremely low levels.

40|$|Results of an {{analysis}} and interpretation of a 3 -A electron density map of yeast phenylalanine <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA.</b> Some earlier detailed assignments of nucleotide residues to electron density peaks {{are found to be}} in error, even though the overall tracing of the backbone conformation of yeast phenylalanine <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> was generally correct. A new, more comprehensive interpretation is made which makes it possible to define the tertiary interactions in the molecule. The new interpretation makes it possible to visualize a number of tertiary interactions which not only explain the structural role of most of the bases which are constant in <b>transfer</b> <b>RNAs,</b> but also makes it possible to understand in a direct and simple fashion the chemical modification data on <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA.</b> In addition, this pattern of tertiary interactions provides a basis for understanding the general three-dimensional folding of all <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> molecules...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of an initiation complex with rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes and certain templates is dependent upon the action of two initiation factors (IF-I and IF-II) of protein synthesis isolated from 0. 5 M KCl extracts of rabbit reticulocyte polysomes. IF-I mediates the GTP-dependent, but template-independent, binding of the cytoplasmic initiator <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (rabbit liver) to a 40 S ribosomal subunit. In {{the presence of a}} 60 S ribosomal subunit and of AUG, AUG(U) 25, or rabbit-globin messenger ribonucleoproteins (but not of rabbit-globin messenger RNAs), IF-II causes the transfer of the initiator <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> to an initiation complex containing an 80 S ribosome. Although 5 ′-guanylylmethylenediphosphonate can replace GTP as the cofactor used in binding the initiator <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> to IF-I or to a 40 S ribosomal subunit, the subsequent transfer of the initiator <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> to an initiation complex requires GTP and cannot take place in the presence of 5 ′-guanylylmethylenediphosphonate. After the {{formation of}} this initiation complex, the initiator <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> is bound in the P site of the 80 S ribosome since exposure of the complex to puromycin releases the methionine residue from the initiator <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> as methionyl-puromycin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The 3 -angstrom {{electron}} density map of crystalline yeast phenylalanine <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> has {{provided us with}} a complete three-dimensional model which defines the positions {{of all of the}} nucleotide residues in the moleclule. The overall features of the molecule are virtually the same as those seen at a resolution of 4 angstroms except that many additional details of tertiary structure are now visualized. Ten types of hydrogen bonding are identified which define the specificity of tertiary interactions. The molecule is also stabilized by considerable stacking of the planar purines and pyritnidines. This tertiary structuire explains, in a simtiple and direct fashion, chemical modification studies of <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA.</b> Since most of the tertiary interactions involve nucleotides which are commnon to all <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> 's, it is likely that this three-dimensional structure provides a basic pattern of folding which may help to clarify the three-dimensional structure of all <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA's.</b> The three-dimensional structure of <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> (tRNA) is of considerable interest in that it may provide insigh...|$|R

40|$|The {{steady-state}} {{growth rate}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was varied by growing the cells in different media. The total amount of ribonucleic acid (RNA) per cell was found to decrease as a nonlinear function of decreasing growh rate. The RNA from cells growing in different media was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Although the amounts of both ribosomal <b>RNA</b> and <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> decreased with decreasing growth rate, the ratio of ribosomal to <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> was not constant. As the growth rate was reduced the ribosomal RNA fraction decreased slightly, whereas the <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> fraction increased slightly. Thus the levels of ribosomal and <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> were regulated to similar yet different extents. The levels of the different ribosomal RNA species were more closely coordinated. At all growth rates the ribosomal RNAs (including 5 S RNA) were present in equimolar amounts. The rate of protein synthesis in yeast cells also decreased with decreasing growth rate.

25|$|Every mRNA {{consists}} of three parts: a 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), a protein-coding region or open reading frame (ORF), and a 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). The coding region carries information for protein synthesis encoded by the genetic code to form triplets. Each triplet of nucleotides of the coding region is called a codon and corresponds to a binding site complementary to an anticodon triplet in <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA.</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>RNAs</b> with the same anticodon sequence always carry an identical type of amino acid. Amino acids are then chained together by the ribosome according {{to the order of}} triplets in the coding region. The ribosome helps <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> to bind to messenger RNA and takes the amino acid from each <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> and makes a structure-less protein out of it.

40|$|Translation of {{the genetic}} code stored in {{messenger}} ribonucleic acid (RNA) requires significantly fewer <b>transfer</b> <b>RNAs</b> (35 – 45) than there are codons (61, amino acid specifying).

The rules governing this RNA:RNA interaction were originally summarised in Crick's ‘wobble hypothesis’. Covalent modification of the first base of an anticodon of a <b>transfer</b> <b>RNA</b> can profoundly affect the degree of flexibility in its base-pairing potential by either extending or restricting such interactions.
