5|$|For {{at least}} a portion of <b>its</b> <b>life,</b> a star shines due to {{thermonuclear}} fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space. Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes. Near the end of <b>its</b> <b>life,</b> a star can also contain degenerate matter. Astronomers can determine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its luminosity, and spectrum respectively. The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over <b>its</b> <b>life,</b> while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram). Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.|$|E

5000|$|One can {{see that}} the self tends to develop a {{relation}} with things which is antagonistic. However, so far as time is concerned this antagonism has in it an element of envy as well. As Singh puts it: [...] "The self believes that time has a life: a <b>life</b> longer than <b>its</b> own <b>life,</b> a life that goes on beyond <b>its</b> own <b>life</b> and was already there when it was born. And the self cannot bear it." [...] Or, in other words: [...] "The self cannot bear...the life of time, a life which makes an appearance in <b>its</b> own <b>life</b> and disappears beyond it, a life before whose disappearance <b>its</b> own <b>life</b> disappears. This disappearance of <b>its</b> own <b>life</b> before the disappearance of the life of time the self cannot bear." [...] With the result that the self gets weighted down by its own creation. [...] "Till now the self {{was the only thing that}} had weight. And its weight was enormous. But now time displaces it. It becomes weightier than the self. This too the self cannot bear. It cannot bear this weight, too. This weight crushes it—the only thing which is crushed by this weight of time." ...|$|R

5|$|Tropical Storm Debby was {{the fifth}} {{tropical}} storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season. Debby formed just {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 21 from a tropical wave. After passing near the Cape Verde islands, Debby moved generally northwestward for much of <b>its</b> <b>life,</b> reaching a peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h). Strong wind shear weakened the storm, and Debby dissipated on August 27 over the northern Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

Upon capture for ringing, it is common to take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E
