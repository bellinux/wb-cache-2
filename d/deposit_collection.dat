50|$|In 1911 the Linden Hills Community Library {{opened on}} the ground floor of the Lake Harriet Commercial Club Building at 2720 43rd Street West.

In October 1911 the <b>deposit</b> <b>collection</b> was moved to the first floor of the Commercial Club and the Library Board designated Linden Hills a branch library and approved the purchase of furnishings and 1,000 new books. A three year lease was signed at $1,000 a year. In 1923 the Commercial Club raised the lease to $1,200 a year and the Library Board considered either renting or purchasing the old telephone building nearby but finally decided to stay. In March 1928 the Library Board was notified after its lease expired in the fall, the first floor space would be leased to the U.S. Post Office (which stayed until 1964).|$|E

50|$|According to the {{original}} task definition provided by {{the organizers of the}} OAEI 2008, the library track involved the alignment of two Dutch thesauri. These Dutch thesauri are used to index books from two collections held by the National Library of the Netherlands (KB). KB maintains two big collections: the <b>Deposit</b> <b>Collection,</b> containing all the Dutch printed publications (one million items), and the Scientific Collection, with about 1.4 million books mainly about the history, language and culture of the Netherlands. Each collection is described according to its own indexing system and conceptual vocabulary. On the one hand, the Scientific Collection was described using the GTT, a huge vocabulary containing 35,000 general concepts ranging from Wolkenkrabbers (Sky-scrapers) to Verzorging (Care). On the other hand, the books contained in the <b>Deposit</b> <b>Collection</b> are mainly indexed against the Brinkman thesaurus, containing a large set of headings (more than 5,000) that were expected to serve as global subjects of books. For each concept, the thesauri provided the usual lexical and semantic information: preferred labels, synonyms and notes, broader and related concepts, etc. The language of both thesauri was Dutch, but a quite substantial part of Brinkman concepts (around 60%) come with English labels. The library track was difficult partly because of its relative large size and because of its multilingual representation. Nevertheless in the library track DSSim has performed the best out of the 3 participating systems. However these ontologies contain related and broader terms therefore the mapping can be carried out without consulting multi-lingual background knowledge.|$|E

5000|$|The 1980 {{discovery}} of scripts for this 1932-33 series led to publication by Pantheon Books, {{as described in}} The New York Times in 1988:Now, {{one of the funniest}} [...] "lost" [...] radio shows of the early 1930s — Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel, Attorneys at Law, starring Groucho and Chico Marx — has been unearthed. Not the voices; in those years radio programs were not regularly recorded. But the transcripts of 25 of the original Flywheel episodes have been found in the archives of the Library of Congress. For viewers and listeners who want to discover — or rediscover — what comedy was all about in those more slaphappy days, the actual scripts of Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel, edited by Michael Barson, will be published in October by Pantheon Books. It happened that in 1980, as part of his Ph.D. studies, Mr. Barson worked as a specialist in the <b>Deposit</b> <b>Collection</b> of the Library of Congress (which oversees the Copyright Office). In a section called [...] "unpublished dramas", he came across the Flywheel scripts. Nobody was aware that they still existed; their copyrights had not been renewed.

40|$|This {{project would}} not be {{possible}} without the collaboration of the National Savings Bank, particularly the Bandarawela and Mahiyangana branches, or without funding provided by the Consortium for Financial Services and Poverty (CFSP). We thank Mike Callen for assistance with the project, and Shawn Cole for comments. Kandy Consulting Group carried out all of the surveys and treatment logistics. ! Deposit collectors are common in many countries (Ashraf et al. 2006). Poor households prove willing to pay for services such as Chit collectors in India or Susu collectors in Western Africa, indicating the value of illiquid savings to those whose financial lives are transacted largely in cash (Rutherford 2000). While small-scale <b>deposit</b> <b>collection</b> can provide a valuable service to households, it is unlikely to create the same multiplier effects as savings that are onlent through modern financial institutions. For this reason, a service that could link <b>deposit</b> <b>collection</b> to the formal banking sector would hold the promise of benefitting both savers and the broader economy through improved intermediation. To examine this, we conducted an experiment in which employees of the National Savings Bank (NSB) worked as deposit collectors for twelve months in semi-rural areas of Sri Lanka. NSB employed a technological innovation to deliver remote banking services in a highl...|$|E
