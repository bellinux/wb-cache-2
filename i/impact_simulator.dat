40|$|This paper {{describes}} a procedure {{to use a}} model interactively to investigate future land use by studying {{a wide range of}} scenarios defining climate, technological and socio-economic changes. A full model run of several hours {{has been replaced by a}} metamodel version which takes a few seconds, and provides the user with an immediate visual output and with the ability to examine easily which factors have the greatest effect. The Regional <b>Impact</b> <b>Simulator</b> combines a model of agricultural land use choices linked with models of urban growth, flooding risk, water quality and consequences for wildlife to estimate plausible futures of agricultural land on a timescale of 20 – 50 years. The model examines the East Anglian and North West regions of the United Kingdom at a grid resolution of 5 × 5 km, and for each scenario estimates the most likely cropping and its profitability at each location, and classifies land use as arable, intensive or extensive grassland or abandoned. From a modelling viewpoint the metamodel approach enables iteration. It is thus possible to determine how product prices change so that production meets demand. The results of the study show that in East Anglia cropping remains quite stable over a wide range of scenarios, though grassland is eliminated in scenarios with the 2050 s High climate scenario – almost certainly due to the low yield in the drier conditions. In the North West there is a very much greater range of outcomes, though all scenarios suggest a reduction in grassland with the greatest in the 2050 s High climate scenario combined with the “Regional Stewardship” (environmental) socio-economic scenario. The effects of the predicted changes in land use on plant species showed suitability for species to vary greatly, particularly between the socio-economic scenarios, due to detrimental effects from increases in nitrogen fertilisation.

Capacitor-type detectors with silicon dioxide dielectric thickness of 0. 4 and 1. 0 microns were tested in the micrometeoroid <b>impact</b> <b>simulator</b> at the Langley Research Center, a 4 -MV Van de Graaff electrostatic accelerator. The carbonyl iron projectiles were from 0. 5 to 5. 0 microns in diameter with velocities from 4 to 10. 0 km/sec.

These tests showed that: (1) the detector operation is reliable when the bias voltage is greater than 30 V; (2) after an impact the detector returns to its original condition with an insignificant loss of active area; and (3) the sensitivity of the detector is inversely proportional to the detector thickness.

40|$|Physical human-robot {{interactions}} are more ubiquitous {{in the past}} few years than ever before. This is due to the development of more sophisticated light mechanical structures and advanced control systems. These direct interactions eliminate classical safety barriers between the robot and the operator. Nevertheless, the safety of humans working closely with robots should be guaranteed despite the absence of such barriers. Recommended speed motion ranges can be very limiting and are not knowledgebased. As a consequence, applications that require high robot mobility and performance are restricted by the imposed motion constraints in order not to inflict injury while in direct contact with a human. The approach in this thesis is to gain knowledge from biomechanics on the injury mechanisms for thoracic and abdominal blunt impacts and estimate human injury probability by means of the so called severity indices. By doing so, one can parametrize injury probability in terms of the robot characteristics such as reflected mass and speed of motion. Therefore, this parametrization allows the robot to a) move in an agile and non-restrained manner while b) guaranteeing that in the case of an impact, the injury probability does not exceed certain thresholds. The implementation of such parametrization, in <b>impact</b> <b>simulators</b> for the thorax and abdomen, allows for rapid assessment of generic robots and estimation of injury probability under various impact conditions. The simulation results are presented in the form of mass-velocity to injury mappings that can be easily used in control schemes...|$|R

40|$|The {{discrete}} element {{method was}} applied to model the impact force of woody debris (trees) on hydrokinetic infrastructure in a river setting. The DEM model, termed the Hydrokinetic Debris <b>Impact</b> <b>Simulator</b> (HDIS) was used to investigate interactions of debris with UAF’s research debris diversion platform (RDDP). The RDDP was designed to protect river energy converters and other hydrokinetic energy infrastructure from floating, woody debris. The RDDP is typically tethered to a surface float that is connected by line and chain to an embedment anchor upstream and below the river bottom. Surface mounted turbines are then tethered behind the RDDP. In this way, the RDDP protects hydrokinetic infrastructure from the impact of trees. HDIS successfully models the interaction and dynamics of discrete bodies (in this case, debris and the RDDP) and determines the forces and torques acting on these bodies due to contact, water, and other, external forces. A key component of the discrete element method is the contact model describing particle-particle interactions. Overall, the discrete element method allows for a realistic simulation of debris-RDDP interactions. In order to improve the fidelity of the drag and buoyancy forces {{as well as the}} debris behavior, HDIS was coupled to a CFD package, OpenFOAM. The OpenFOAM package allows for realistic simulations of the complex hydrodynamics that contribute to the RDDP’s ability to effectively shed debris {{and at the same time}} broadens the utility of HDIS for simulating more complex debris-infrastructure interactions including evaluating failure modes of the RDDP.

A survey and discussion is presented of technology assessments, primarily from a methodological viewpoint. A general ideal methodology is developed and the potentials for incorporating uncertainties are described. There is particular emphasis on the impacts of assumptions and potential methods for incorporating concepts of uncertainty. The implementation of an ideal assessment methodology resulted in the second task involving the coding of a simulator that {{should be viewed as}} a framework for assembling and manipulating information about the economics, emissions, ambient concentrations, and potential health impacts of different types and configurations of electric power generating facilities. The framework is probabilistic, and thus results in several measures of the range of various consequences, in other words a graphic display {{of the quality of the}} various predictions. The simulator is structured so that it is easy to improve the sophistication of certain manipulations, or to replace generic data, or update or add new data. The latest version of the simulator is available from the authors and can be operated in batch or interactive modes. The third task involved the prediction of the ambient air quality standards over the next thirty years. This was required in order to have benchmarks against which to compare the performance of facilities which are simulated in the task 2 simulator. This third task required the development of a standards prediction methodology through a modified Delphi-style survey of a large set of consultants.

40|$|The Earth’s surface {{bears the}} scars of 4. 5 billion years of {{bombardment}} by asteroids, despite most having been erased by tectonic activity and erosion. Asteroids predominantly orbit the Sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, but a large number occupy orbits close to the Earth’s. These bodies are termed Near Earth Objects (NEOs) and they present a very real impact threat to the Earth. In 1998 NASA inaugurated the ‘Spaceguard Survey’ to catalogue 90 % of NEOs greater than 1 km in diameter. The smaller bodies, meanwhile, remain undetected and far more numerous. In {{order to understand the}} NEO hazard, the consequences resulting from an asteroid impact require modelling. While the atmospheric entry of asteroids is a critical part of the impact process, it is the surface impact which is most important, both onto land and into the oceans. It is the impact generated effects (IGEs) that are hazardous to human populations on the Earth and the infrastructure they occupy. By modelling these IGEs and the consequences they present for humans and infrastructure, an understanding of the global vulnerability to the hazard is developed. ‘NEOimpactor’ is the software solution built to investigate the global vulnerability to NEO impacts. By combining existing mathematical models which describe the impact and effects, a unified <b>impact</b> <b>simulator</b> tool has been developed with the capacity to model the real consequences of any terrestrial impact. By comparing the consequences of multiple impact events, a complete vulnerability assessment of the global NEO hazard is derived. The result maps are designed for ease of dissemination to explain the impact risk to a non-specialist audience. The system has identified China, US, India, Japan and Brazil as facing the greatest overall risk, as well as indicating the various factors influencing vulnerability. The results can be used for informing the international decision making processes regarding the NEO hazard and potential mitigation strategies.

40|$|In Maize (Zea maize L.), cost {{of hybrid}} seed {{production}} {{is directly related}} to the yield and quality of seed obtained per hectare of female parent. It is also important to consider the effects that a male parent can exert on the development of hybrid seed in the female parent. This effect is known as xenia. The objectives of this study were to evaluate xenia effects on (1) yield as 80 K units, (2) germination of the hybrid seed and (3) susceptibility of the hybrid seed to mechanical damage. One female inbred and four male inbred lines were selected from a parent list of hybrids. The experiment was designed to allow individual cross pollination between each male inbred and the female inbred line. For use as a control, the female inbred was allowed to self pollinate. Experiments were conducted in Illinois and Iowa during 2008 and 2009 and in Nebraska during 2009. A significant inbred effect was detected on yield as 80 k (α= 0. 001). The selfed female and pollination with male inbred B resulted in lower yields of hybrid seed. For germination, a significant inbred effect was detected (α= 0. 001), but was due to lower germination percentage of seed produced on the selfed female. All hybrid combinations resulted in higher germination percentages with no significant differences among hybrids. The inbred x mechanical damage interaction was significant (P= 0. 04) for effects on cold saturated soil germination tests. Use of inbred B resulted in a two-percentage-point reduction in cold germination when treated with the <b>impact</b> <b>simulator.</b> In a maize seed company, the production research group provides yield estimates for production of new hybrid combinations. Results from this study indicate that using only the female inbred yield may provide inaccurate estimates. Therefore to improve yield estimation, experiments should be designed to include male inbreds. Male inbreds can also impart a negative effect to the hybrid seed on tolerance to mechanical damage, thus lowering quality and increasing seed discard. When testing for hybrid seed germination, there is no need to consider distinct hybrid combinations. Female inbreds can be grown in open-pollinated fields to avoid loss of vigor observed with selfing. ...|$|E

Data of these smallholder dairy farms were collected by means of a questionnaire and included all farm resources and enterprises. The Technology <b>Impact</b> Evaluation <b>Simulator</b> (TIES), a Monte Carlo computer simulation model, provides a method for evaluating the financial and economic impacts of technology changes on a whole-farm basis, and explicitly incorporates risk.

40|$|Background: Currently, {{training}} in interventional electrophysiology {{is based on}} conventional methodologies, and a paucity of data on the usefulness of simulation in this field is available. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the <b>impact</b> of <b>simulator</b> training on trainees' performance in electrophysiologic catheter placement during the early phase of their learning curve. Methods: Inexperienced electrophysiology fellows were considered. A hybrid high-fidelity simulator (Procedicus VIST, version 7. 0, Mentice AB Gothenburg, Sweden for Biosense Webster) was used. The following parameters were evaluated in 3 consecutive patient-based procedures before and after two training sessions of at least 1. 5 hours on the simulator: (1) ability to place catheters in conventional recording/pacing sites (coronary sinus, His-bundle area, high right atrium, and right ventricular apex); (2) amount of help provided by the supervisor (scale from 1 - 3; 3 for maximal help); (3) fluoroscopy time; and (4) positioning time. Results: Seven fellows performed 168 catheter placements during 42 patient-based procedures with no complications. Comparing parameters before and after simulator training, there was a significant reduction in the mean amount of help and in fluoroscopy and positioning times per placement: from 1. 71 ± 1. 24 to 0. 42 ± 0. 68 (P <. 001), from 121 ± 88 seconds to 76 ± 54 seconds (P <. 001), and from 175 ± 138 seconds to 102 ± 74 seconds (P <. 001), respectively. Overall fluoroscopy time per patient decreased from 567 ± 220 seconds to 305 ± 111 seconds (P <. 0001). Improvement appeared to be related to simulator training alone and not to the previously performed patient-based procedures.

40|$|Choice {{simulators}} {{have provided}} very useful ways to allow researchers to project from {{individual or group}} preference models to predictions of market share. We propose that effective choice simulators need three properties to effectively mirror market behavior. First, they need to display differential impact so that a marketing action at the individual or homogeneous segment level has maximal impact near a threshold but has minimal <b>impact</b> otherwise. Second, <b>simulators</b> need to reflect differential substitution, assuring that alternatives take proportionately more share from similar than dissimilar competitors. Finally, they need to exhibit differential enhancement, a property whereby a small value difference has {{a big impact on}} highly similar competitors but almost none on dissimilar ones. A new method we call Randomized First Choice enables simulators to closely match these properties in market behavior. The method begins with a first choice model in which the item with the highest utility is chosen, but modifies that by adding two kinds of variability. The first, product value variability, adds variability to the alternatives, while the second, attribute value variability, adds variability to attribute part worths. While product variability is mathematically equivalent to the commonly used adjustment for scale, we show that attribute variability is also critical to approximate desired substitution and enhancement properties among similar alternatives...|$|R

Characterize the head movement, compare maximal post impact head speed between ATD and human volunteers and defereneces between volunteer with eye control and without. Methods: Measuring was done with 8 volunteers and ATD (Manikin, 50 th percentile man). For each volunteer were done two measurements, first without eye control and second with eye control. ATD was measured twice. It was recorded by Qualisys system, specifically by three optical cameras, on crash simulator. Results were processed in Qualisys Track Manager. There were tracked three markers, two on the body - forehead, shoulder {{and one on the}} sledge. Results: Results showed that speed of the head depends on eye control. Volunteer without eye control had higher post impact speed of head (4, 94 m/s) than ATD (3, 67 m/s) and volunteer with eye contact (3, 19 m/s). Quite the same result was observed in change of distance between head and sledge after impact. There was higher value for volunteer without eye contact than for ATD.

40|$|Uncertainty in the {{simulation}} {{of the carbon}} cycle contributes significantly to uncertainty in the projections of future climate change. We use observations of forest fraction to constrain carbon cycle and land surface input parameters of the global climate model FAMOUS, {{in the presence of}} an uncertain structural error. Using an ensemble of climate model runs to build a computationally cheap statistical proxy (emulator) of the climate model, we use history matching to rule out input parameter settings where the corresponding climate model output is judged sufficiently different from observations, even allowing for uncertainty. Regions of parameter space where FAMOUS best simulates the Amazon forest fraction are incompatible with the regions where FAMOUS best simulates other forests, indicating a structural error in the model. We use the emulator to simulate the forest fraction at the best set of parameters implied by matching the model to the Amazon, Central African, South East Asian, and North American forests in turn. We can find parameters that lead to a realistic forest fraction in the Amazon, but that using the Amazon alone to tune the simulator would result in a significant overestimate of forest fraction in the other forests. Conversely, using the other forests to tune the simulator leads to a larger underestimate of the Amazon forest fraction. We use sensitivity analysis to find the parameters which have the most <b>impact</b> on <b>simulator</b> output and perform a history-matching exercise using credible estimates for simulator discrepancy and observational uncertainty terms. We are unable to constrain the parameters individually, but we rule out just under half of joint parameter space as being incompatible with forest observations. We discuss the possible sources of the discrepancy in the simulated Amazon, including missing processes in the land surface component and a bias in the climatology of the Amazon.
