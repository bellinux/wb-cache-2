25|$|The {{mother of}} Bindusara (born c. 320 BC, ruled 298– c. 272 BC), the second Mauryan Samrat (emperor) of India, accidentally {{consumed}} poison and {{died when she}} was close to delivering him. Chanakya, the Chandragupta's teacher and adviser, made up <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the baby should survive. He cut open the belly of the queen and took out the baby, thus saving the baby's life.|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} before {{the events of the}} first film, Michael had been engaged to a woman, named Samantha, before she dies in a tragic car crash, leaving Michael devastated, as he did not possess the type of medical {{training}} to treat her for her injuries before help could arrive. In the first installment, he insists that he has no doubt in <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> if he had known back then what he knew now that he could have saved her.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, another sibling of Richard's, Oba Rahl, suffers {{under an}} abusive {{mother on the}} family farm. Oba imagines himself as {{energetic}} and the possessor of a healthy curiosity. His inquisitive nature manifests itself especially through pleasure in watching things die under his hand. Oba does not know that he, along with Jennsen, is pristinely ungifted and immune to magic. His mother sends him to a nearby sorceress to buy medicine, and, during the purchase, he begins to menace the magic user. Her attempts to defend herself with magic fail and Oba kills her brutally. During the fight, Oba surrenders to a voice in <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> promises invincibility in return for obedience. After returning home, Oba kills his mother and resolves to see the world. He can travel comfortably with the funds he looted from the sorceress.|$|E

The miracle necessary here would be for him to change his moral force, his blood, the habits of <b>his</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>That's</b> beyond <b>his</b> power." ...|$|R

25|$|Sītāsvayaṃvaram (Sanskrit: सीतास्वयंवरम्). Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa get up {{next morning}} and bow to Viśvāmitra. The three come {{together}} to the Svayaṃvara of Sītā. The children, youth and elderly, and the maidens of Mithilā are enraptured {{by the sight of}} Rāma. Janaka sees Rāma and prays in <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> Rāma breaks the bow of Śiva. The twelve different groups of people in the assembly at Sītā's Svayaṃvara view Rāma with twelve different emotions (Rasas). The bards of Mithilā announce the vow of Janaka – the prince who is able to string the Pināka, the bow of Śiva, will have the right to marry Sītā. Many kings in the assembly, including Bāṇāsura and Rāvaṇa try to lift the bow but are unsuccessful. Ten thousand kings endeavour to lift the bow together but are not able to. Janaka is disappointed and asks all kings to go home, saying that he would rather Sītā remain a spinster if the earth has become devoid of the brave. On hearing Janaka's words, Lakṣmaṇa expresses his anger in the assembly but Rāma calms him down with the gesture of his eyes. Viśvāmitra orders Rāma to break the bow. Rāma lifts the bow {{as if it were a}} straw and breaks it into two instantly. Amidst the chanting of Vedic Mantras by Viśvāmitra, Sītā garlands Rāma. Janaka acclaims Rāma by bowing to him.|$|E
25|$|UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz, referee John McCarthy {{and a team}} {{of lawyers}} were in court until 4:30p.m. {{on the day of the}} fight battling with the District Attorney of Michigan, who was trying to prevent the UFC from holding the event in the state. An {{ultimatum}} was issued: the fight could go on as long as there were no closed fisted strikes to the head and no headbutts. The UFC, desperate to put the show on, agreed to the terms. Fighters were warned hours before the show that they would be arrested if they punched to the head with a closed fist. When Shamrock learned of the sudden rule change, he made up <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> he was not going to fight. While training for the match, Shamrock suffered a torn lateral meniscus, a partially torn ACL, a broken nose, and cracked ribs. His injuries combined with the rule change, he did not think he could win the fight because all of his weapons were taken away from him. Shamrock was also fearful that he would be arrested; the troubled boys from his father's foster home would be watching him and he was afraid of setting a bad example. If Shamrock withdrew, the main event would have been cancelled and the UFC could have suffered substantial monetary damage. After UFC owner Bob Meyrowitz and other UFC officials pleaded with Shamrock to go on with the show, Shamrock, despite the injuries and new rules, reluctantly gave in to the pressure.|$|E
500|$|Cagney {{secured the}} lead role in the 1926–27 season West End {{production}} of Broadway by George Abbott. The show's management insisted that he copy Broadway lead Lee Tracy's performance, despite Cagney's discomfort in doing so, but {{the day before the}} show sailed for England, they decided to replace him. This was a devastating turn of events for Cagney; apart from the logistical difficulties this presented—the couple's luggage was in the hold of the ship and they had given up their apartment. He almost quit show business. As Vernon recalled, [...] "Jimmy said that it was all over. He made up <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> he would get a job doing something else." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Metro Silicon Valley, Pete Postlethwaite quoted Bryan Singer as saying that all the characters are Söze. When asked point blank whether his character is Söze, Postlethwaite said, [...] "Who knows? Nobody knows. That's what's good about The Usual Suspects." [...] Spacey has also been evasive about his character's true identity. In {{an interview}} with Total Film, he said, [...] "That's for the audience to decide. My job is {{to show up and}} do a part – I don't own the audience's imagination." [...] Singer said the film is ambiguous about most of the character's details, but the fax sent {{at the end of the}} film proves in <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> Kint is Söze.|$|E
500|$|Ramsey {{had made}} up <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> he wanted to remain in {{football}} as a coach, {{but he had no}} relevant qualifications or managerial experience. While he spent the 1955 off-season coaching in Southern Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe), Ipswich Town of the Third Division South received permission from Anderson to speak to Ramsey about signing him as player-manager. When Ramsey met the Ipswich hierarchy on his return from Africa, he refused to combine management with playing. [...] "I told them I would only concentrate on one job," [...] Ramsey later said; [...] "it would be impossible to play with the players I would be coaching." [...] This settled, Ipswich announced Ramsey's appointment as manager on 9 August 1955.|$|E
500|$|Grant then ordered Sherman {{to embark}} his army on steamers {{and join the}} Union forces confronting Lee in Virginia, but Sherman instead persuaded Grant {{to allow him to}} march north through the Carolinas, {{destroying}} everything of military value along the way, as he had done in Georgia. He was particularly interested in targeting South Carolina, the first state to secede from the Union, because of the effect that it would have on Southern morale. His army proceeded north through South Carolina against light resistance from the troops of Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston. Upon hearing that Sherman's men were advancing on corduroy roads through the Salkehatchie swamps at a rate of a dozen miles per day, Johnston [...] "made up <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> there had been no such army in existence since the days of Julius Caesar." ...|$|E

500|$|Several anecdotes {{concerning}} Bogdan-Pitești's {{morals and}} extravagant lifestyle were in circulation from his lifetime. In 1912, Macedonski published an autobiographical Christmas story. It tells how, inspired by Macedonski's desire {{to feed his}} family a traditional turkey feast, Bogdan-Pitești sent him the bird stuffed with 50 gold lei. As T. Vianu writes, such [...] "attitudes of a grand feudal lord" [...] made Bogdan-Pitești into an [...] "indisputably picturesque" [...] person. The account was partly confirmed by Constantin Beldie, who also noted that, during those years, Alexandru Macedonski was [...] "starving" [...] and had to provide for [...] "a house full of children". Zambaccian however cites a contrasting story once told by actor Ion Iancovescu. It suggests that, during the wartime famine, Macedonski asked Bogdan-Pitești to pay him 1million lei {{for one of the}} few surviving copies of Bronzes; Bogdan-Pitești bluntly offered him 5 lei—Macedonski gave in, commenting that [...] "he is capable of changing <b>his</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>that</b> con artist!" [...] Bogdan-Pitești's mood swings were also discussed by memoirist Radu D. Rosetti. He writes that the boyar scarcely minded when his fortune was being siphoned away by some members of his retinue, but that he publicly humiliated Galaction, and even Domnica, over random expenses.|$|E

"And I {{think at}} that time he'd made up <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be a}} good idea to tie {{intelligence}} into the inner circle of his policy-making and decision-making process.

2500|$|However, in his [...] {{claims that}} Although Dyer later {{claimed to have}} {{undertaken}} the massacre to ‘save’ British India, he had had no such idea in <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> fateful afternoon.

2500|$|Menefee was {{appointed}} to the House Ways and Means Committee. The first bill he offered to the House authorized the construction of the first turnpike in Bath County and gave control of the turnpike to the Owingsville and Big Sandy Road Company; this bill passed and was signed into law by Governor James Clark on February 16, 1832. His most notable action in the House was arguing against the repeal of an 1833 law that prohibited the importation of slaves. Fellow representative Thomas F. Marshall called Menefee's speech on this occasion [...] "the master effort of <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> winter." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Wonderous Stories" [...] is {{the second}} track on the album solely written by Anderson. He wrote the song during [...] "a {{beautiful}} day" [...] while living in Switzerland, [...] "one of those days you want to remember for years afterwards". During the day, the lyrics to the track entered <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> he later wrote down. He noted the song's meaning as [...] "the joys of life, {{as opposed to the}} uptightedness of some aspects of life" [...] that was inspired by romantic stories and [...] "a kind of dream sequence". White contributed the idea of the drums and bass playing on odd beats.|$|E
2500|$|Richardson {{was one of}} {{the great}} gentleman riders of his day having 56 winners in 1872, in {{addition}} he trained race horses at his Limber Magna stables. [...] He won the 1873 and 1874 Grand Nationals riding horses he had trained being Disturbance and Reugny. [...] Both were owned by James Octavius Machell with whom he fell out when Machell tried to manipulated the betting for the 1874 race. Richardson was so offended at the proposal made to him and disgusted with the sordid nature of the whole business that he made up <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that,</b> win or lose, his race on Reugny should be his last.|$|E

2500|$|Ted Williams was on uncomfortable {{terms with}} the Boston {{newspapers}} for nearly twenty years, as he felt they liked to discuss his personal life {{as much as his}} baseball performance. He maintained a career-long feud with SPORT magazine due to a 1948 feature article in which the SPORT reporter included a quote from Williams' mother. Insecure about his upbringing, and stubborn because of immense confidence in his own talent, Williams made up <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "knights of the Press Box" [...] were against him. After having hit for the league's Triple Crown in 1947, Williams narrowly lost the MVP award in a vote where one midwestern newspaper writer left Williams entirely off his ten-player ballot.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1890, Ranjitsinhji and Ramsinhji took a holiday in Bournemouth. For the trip, Ranji adopted the name [...] "K. S. [...] Ranjitsinhji". While in Bournemouth, he took more {{interest}} in cricket, achieving success in local matches which suggested he possessed talent, but little refinement of technique. According to Wilde, {{by the time he}} returned to Trinity in September 1890, he was beginning to realise the benefit of others believing him to be a person of importance, something that was to lead to him adopting the title [...] "Prince Ranjitsinhji", although he had no right to call himself a [...] "Prince". Significantly, the trip planted the seed in <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> he might find success as a cricketer.|$|E
2500|$|Without having {{much in the}} way of {{sustenance}} or {{good news}} to offer the British people, he took a risk in deliberately choosing to emphasise the dangers instead. [...] "Rhetorical power", wrote Churchill, [...] "is neither wholly bestowed, nor wholly acquired, but cultivated." [...] Not all were impressed by his oratory. Robert Menzies, Australian Prime Minister, said of Churchill during the Second World War: [...] "His real tyrant is the glittering phrase so attractive to <b>his</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> awkward facts have to give way." [...] Another associate wrote: [...] "He is... the slave of the words which his mind forms about ideas... And he can convince himself of almost every truth if it is once allowed thus to start on its wild career through his rhetorical machinery." ...|$|E
