2500|$|As for {{the types}} of pollinators, reptile pollinators are known, but they form a {{minority}} in most ecological situations. They are most frequent and most ecologically significant in island systems, where insect and sometimes also bird populations may be unstable and less species-rich. Adaptation {{to a lack of}} animal food and of predation pressure, might therefore favour reptiles becoming more herbivorous and more inclined to feed on pollen and nectar. Most species of lizards in the families that seem to be significant in pollination seem to carry pollen only incidentally, especially the larger species such as Varanidae [...] and Iguanidae, but especially several species of the <b>Gekkonidae</b> are active pollinators, and so is at least one species of the Lacertidae, Podarcis lilfordi, which pollinates various species, but in particular is the major pollinator of Euphorbia dendroides on various Mediterranean islands.|$|E
50|$|The family <b>Gekkonidae</b> {{to which}} G. variegata belongs to are of Gondwanan origin. When the land mass of Australia split from Gondwana, it {{contained}} early agamids and diplodactlyds, the latter encompassing geckoes. During the evolutionary history of lizards the family <b>Gekkonidae</b> and Gekkoninae subfamily {{developed in the}} Scleroglossa group, which use their jaws rather than tongues when eating. The Scleroglossan group includes the clade Gekkota consisting of three families, including <b>Gekkonidae.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gekkonidae</b> is {{the largest}} family of geckos, {{containing}} over 950 described species in 51 genera. Many [...] "typical" [...] geckos are members of <b>Gekkonidae,</b> including house geckos (Hemidactylus), tokay geckos (Gekko gecko), and day geckos (Phelsuma). Gekkonid geckos occur globally and are particularly species-rich in tropical areas.|$|E
