40|$|SUMMARY: The {{production}} by certain species of Clostridiwn of enzymes disintegrating <b>hide</b> <b>powder</b> was investigated {{by measuring the}} lytic action of broth cultures and toxic filtrates on finely divided <b>hide</b> <b>powder</b> suspended in an agar gel. Cl. histolyticum was the most active producer of enzyme, Cl. welchii A was less active and Cl. sporogenes and Cl. bifermentnns only moderately active. CZ. tetnni, CZ. oedemutiens and C 1. septicum produced no such enzyme. The lytic enzyme of CZ. histolyticum is not the lethal toxin. Among strains of Cl. welchii type A, enzyme production, a-toxin production and ability to cause fatal infection in guinea-pigs are associated. There was some evidence that the different enzymes affecting <b>hide</b> <b>powder</b> are antigenically related, but no definite conclusion is possible, since the antisera employed may have contained antibodies to the lytic enzymes {{of a number of}} different organisms.

40|$|Proteases {{are used}} in leather {{manufacture}} in the processes of soaking, unhairing and bating of hides and skins. However proteases can be relatively non-specific in their usage, and for improved efficacy of enzyme biocatalysis within the industry, an analysis of specific activities of enzymes towards skin proteins was undertaken. Most commercial proteases for soaking showed substantial activity against the substrates elastin-Congo Red and Azocoll but little or no activity against keratin-azure and <b>hide</b> <b>powder</b> black. Enzymes used for unhairing in conjunction with 30 % of the usual concentration of sulfide to effect chemical unhairing showed moderate activity against all substrates tested (selected as representative of skin proteins), while proteases used in bating showed activity against Azocoll and elastin-Congo Red but had no keratinase activity and little activity against <b>hide</b> <b>powder</b> black. Bating proteases and soaking proteases displayed similar activities at pH 8. Microbes isolated in the screening of organisms from putrefied skins included one fungal and two bacterial isolates whose extracellular enzymes had efficient unhairing activity without the addition of sulfide. Enzyme activities for these proteases included high activity measured against Azocoll {{with little or no}} activity against elastin-Congo Red, keratin-azure and <b>hide</b> <b>powder</b> black.

40|$|Exoprotease {{activity}} during 120 h of total energy and nutrient starvation was examined in two marine bacteria, Vibrio sp. strain S 14 and Pseudomonas sp. strain S 9. The activity {{was determined by}} spectrophotometric measurement of the rate of release of soluble color from an insoluble azure dye derivative of <b>hide</b> <b>powder</b> (<b>hide</b> <b>powder</b> azure). Starved cells of both strains (5 h for S 14, and 4 or 24 h for S 9) showed greater extracellular proteolytic activity than {{at the onset of}} starvation. The exoprotease activity of cells starved {{for longer periods of time}} then decreased, but was found to be present at significant levels throughout the starvation period studied (120 h). The accumulation of exoprotease activity in the bulk phase during starvation indicated that both strains constitutively excreted extracellular proteases. As deduced from experiments with chloramphenicol, de novo protein synthesis during starvation was required for the production and/or release of the exoproteases into the surrounding environment. The degradation of <b>hide</b> <b>powder</b> azure allowed an immediate increase in respiration rate, also by long-term-starved cells. This suggests that metabolic systems are primed to respond to the availability of substrates, allowing the cells to recover rapidly. The regulation of exoprotease activity was also studied and found to be different in the two strains. Casamino Acids repressed exoprotease activity in Pseudomonas sp. strain S 9, whereas a mechanism similar to catabolite repression was found for Vibrio sp. strain S 14 in that glucose repressed activity and cyclic AMP reversed this effect. The exoproteases appeared to be metalloproteinases because the addition of EDTA to cell-free starvation supernatants from both strains significantly inhibited the activity of the proteases...|$|E
40|$|Vegetable tannins used in tanning of {{hides and skins}} {{are limited}} to surface {{reactions}} by their large molecular weights. The molecular weight reduces penetration into the skin and lowers the thermal stability or tanning effect. Investigation into the utilisation of small phenolic compounds such as catechin to improve penetration with subsequent in situ enzymecatalysed polymerisation may provide a novel and alternative tanning agent. In this research, catechin was oxidised by enzymatic catalysis using laccase, with the polymerisation confirmed by FT-IR and UHPLC. Tanning experiments were undertaken to measure the effect of laccase-catalysed polymerisation of catechin in the thermal stabilisation of collagen, by monitoring the change in shrinkage temperature between the treated and untreated sample of <b>hide</b> <b>powder</b> (ΔTs). This study demonstrates that the stabilisation of collagen (ΔTs) is increased {{with the use of}} in situ enzyme-catalysed polymerisation. Depolymerisation of condensed tannins is presented as an alternative source of low molecular weight phenolics to be applied in the stabilisation of collagen. In this research, mimosa tannin from the Black Wattle tree (Acacia mearnsii) was used in the depolymerisation process. Preliminary experiments on depolymerisation were undertaken using the methods laccase-mediator system and L-cysteine in mild acidic medium, both showing unsatisfactory results. Acid-catalysed depolymerisation followed by nucleophile addition is a common analytical method for determining the degree of polymerisation of proanthocyanidins. The acid-catalysed depolymerisation method was scaled-up, with the addition of pyrogallol as a nucleophile trapping agent, and powdered depolymerised mimosa was obtained. Data show an increase in the monomeric content and decrease in percentage of condensed tannins for the acid-catalysed process, indicating the potential of the depolymerisation of mimosa tannin in obtaining environmentally friendly sources of low molecular weight phenolic compounds for use in large scale/industrial applications. The depolymerised product was applied in the stabilisation of <b>hide</b> <b>powder</b> and goat skin. Using <b>hide</b> <b>powder,</b> data show that the laccase-assisted polymerisation of the depolymerised mimosa reached higher values of ΔTs in comparison with the conventional process employing unmodified mimosa. Using goat skin, the new process achieved similar values of ΔTs as the conventional process. In order to obtain similar results for goat skin as obtained with <b>hide</b> <b>powder,</b> an optimisation may be carried out. Therefore, data obtained demonstrates the potential of the new route in vegetable tanning of leather...|$|E

40|$|Waste {{management}} in the leather industry worldwide {{is an issue of}} major importance for both solid and liquid wastes. It has been recognised that there are major environmental impacts from the poorly managed disposal of such wastes and these have a clear health impact upon human society. Within Europe, under EU driven legislation, the costs of wastes management are increasing rapidly and there is a clear need to research improved methods to cost effectively deal with leather industry wastes. Biodegradation (anaerobic), as a management option, of solid wastes from the leather industry is an area that is attracting increased interest in recent years as being a technique that has wide public acceptability as well as process efficiency. However, tanning agents that prolong the lifetime of leather goods {{have a negative impact on}} biodegradation and this needs to be addressed before efficient treatment can occur. To drive the agenda this research has the aims of • Highlighting the effects of tanning agent on anaerobic digestion. • Understanding the mechanism(s) by which different leather tannages can biodegraded. • Developing a process to reverse the action of tannage. Leather solid wastes were anaerobically digested using Serum Bottle Assays (SBA). The effect of a range of vegetable, mineral and aldehyde tanning agents of leather on the rate of anaerobic digestion was assessed. Common tanning agents used included; myrica, valonea, glutaraldehyde and chrome. To further identify key factors for cost effective anaerobic digestion, tanned <b>hide</b> <b>powders</b> and tanned leathers were also pre-treated using autoclaving, liming, enzymes etc, in an attempt to determine whether tannage may be reversed. Major techniques used in the research include: anaerobic digestion, Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP), Total Solids contents (TS), Gas Chromatography (GC) and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Hydrolysable tannins are less resistant to anaerobic digestion than condensed tannins. However, enzymatic pre-treatment reduces the resistance and this offers a new effective pre-treatment route. Thermal pre-treatment also decreased resistance to anaerobic digression especially for chrome, glutaraldehyde, myrica and tannic acid tanned leathers. Chemical pre-treatment also generally lowered the resistance to anaerobic digestion. Selective pre-treatment offers a means of improving the cost effectiveness of anaerobic digestion of leather and therefore enabling a new waste management method to be adopted by the industry. A relationship emerges, in some cases, between chemical structure of tanning agent and inhibition of anaerobic digestion. This offers the possibility of producing new, designed organic tanning agents with, suitable properties, to be adopted by the industiy, The research agenda within the leather industry is still ongoing and recommendations for future research are addressed...|$|R
6000|$|There is {{no end of}} such stories. They were {{repeated}} and believed by the gravest and wisest men down {{to the end of}} the sixteenth century; they were received undoubtingly by the great majority down {{to the end of the}} seventeenth. The Devil was an easy way of accounting for what was beyond men's comprehension. He was the simple and satisfactory answer to all the conundrums of Nature. And what the Devil had not time to bestow his personal attention upon, the witch was always ready to do for him. Was a doctor at a loss about a case? How could he save his credit more cheaply than by pronouncing it witchcraft, and turning it over to the parson to be exorcised? Did a man's cow die suddenly, or his horse fall lame? Witchcraft! Did one of those writers of controversial quartos, heavy as the stone of Diomed, feel a pain in the small of his back? Witchcraft! Unhappily there were always ugly old women; and if you crossed them in any way, or did them a wrong, they were given to scolding and banning. If, within a year or two after, anything should happen to you or yours, why, of course, old Mother Bombie or Goody Blake must be at the bottom of it. For it was perfectly well known that there were witches, (does not God's law say expressly, [...] "Suffer not a witch to live?") and that they could cast a spell by the mere glance of their eyes, could cause you to pine away by melting a waxen image, could give you a pain wherever they liked by sticking pins into the same, could bring sickness into your house or into your barn by <b>hiding</b> a Devil's <b>powder</b> under the threshold; and who knows what else? Worst of all, they could send a demon into your body, who would cause you to vomit pins, hair, pebbles, knives,-indeed, almost anything short of a cathedral,-without any fault of yours, utter through you the most impertinent things verbi ministro, and, in short, make you the most important personage in the parish for the time being. Meanwhile, you were an object of condolence and contribution to the whole neighborhood. What wonder if a lazy apprentice or servant-maid (Bekker gives several instances of the kind detected by him) should prefer being possessed, with its attendant perquisites, to drudging from morning till night? And to any one who has observed how common a thing in certain states of mind self-connivance is, and how near it is to self-deception, it will not be surprising that some were, to all intents and purposes, really possessed. Who has never felt an almost irresistible temptation, and seemingly not self-originated, to let himself go? to let his mind gallop and kick and curvet and roll like a horse turned loose? in short, as we Yankees say, [...] "to speak out in meeting"? Who never had it suggested to him by the fiend to break in at a funeral with a real character of the deceased, instead of that Mrs. Grundyfied view of him which the clergyman is so painfully elaborating in his prayer? Remove the pendulum of conventional routine, and the mental machinery runs on with a whir that gives a delightful excitement to sluggish temperaments, and is, perhaps, the natural relief of highly nervous organizations. The tyrant Will is dethroned, and the sceptre snatched by his frolic sister Whim. This state of things, if continued, must become either insanity or imposture. But who can say precisely where consciousness ceases and a kind of automatic movement begins, the result of over-excitement? The subjects of these strange disturbances have been almost always young women or girls at a critical period of their development. Many of the most remarkable cases have occurred in convents, and both there and elsewhere, as in other kinds of temporary nervous derangement, have proved contagious. Sometimes, as in the affair of the nuns of Loudon, there seems every reason to suspect a conspiracy; but I am not quite ready to say that Grandier was the only victim, and that some of the energumens were not unconscious tools in the hands of priestcraft and revenge. One thing is certain: that in the dioceses of humanely sceptical prelates the cases of possession were sporadic only, and either cured, or at least hindered from becoming epidemic, by episcopal mandate. Cardinal Mazarin, when Papal vice-legate at Avignon, made an end of the trade of exorcism within his government.|$|R

Quantitative analysis of polyphenols and tannins was therefore performed. Materials and Methods: Plant material was collected over two consecutive seasons in the Pharmaceutical Botanical Garden “Fran Kušan” of the Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Zagreb, Croatia. The content of total polyphenols, non-tannin polyphenols and tannins was determined by combination of spectrophotometric and <b>hide</b> <b>powder</b> method. Results: The quantity of total polyphenols of investigated species ranged from 0. 87 to 4. 1 %.

Kraft lignin degradation by a biomimetic system was investigated, using haemin and hydrogen peroxide, which mimics the catalytic mechanism of lignin peroxidase to produce phenolic compounds. The degradation products were identified using spectroscopic methods and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 2 -methoxyphenol, 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin and vanillic acid were produced and their formaldehyde polymerisation products were used for tanning collagen. The denaturation (shrinkage) temperature of collagen was raised to 80 °C through hydrogen bonding interactions between the polymers and the protein. For dyeing of <b>hide</b> <b>powder,</b> the lignin degradation products were reacted with laccase (a polyphenol oxidase); 2 -methoxyphenol gave the darkest colour. These products have potential to be used as raw materials for tanning and dyeing of animal skins. Therefore, this can add value to the industrial byproduct (Kraft lignin) and reduce its environmental impact. Polyphenols are the basic building blocks of natural skin and hair pigments: they can be polymerised to create versions of natural black, brown and orange melanins. These reactions can be catalysed by laccase; not only do they create colour, but also if they are conducted in the presence of collagen, the resulting pigment is bound to the leather in a covalent tanning manner. Therefore, the leather becomes coloured by a lightfast pigment, which is firmly fixed. It appears to be a feature of this type of stabilising mechanism for collagen, the creation of a polyphenol matrix around the triple helix, that it has the added benefit of actually strengthening the leather. Since every traditional process step effectively weakens collagen, especially tanning, this is the first chemical reaction that has been shown to reverse that effect. Leather tanning reactions between collagen and dihydroxynaphthalenes (DHNs) and oxazolidine have been investigated, using <b>hide</b> <b>powder</b> and sheepskin pickled pelt. This investigation showed that some DHNs have a tanning effect on collagen. The measurement of combined and cross-linked DHNs on collagen showed that 30 - 40...|$|E
40|$|Guinea pig a-macroglobulin was {{purified}} to apparent homogeneity by sequential chromatography on Sephacryl S- 300, DEAE-cellulose, and hydroxyapatite. A {{molecular weight}} of 780, 000 {{was obtained by}} equilibrium sedimentation. The preparation migrated as a single band of Mr = 180, 000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Rabbit antiserum raised against the final preparation partially cross-reacted with human and rat a- 2 -macroglobulins but not with rat a- 1 -macroglobulin. Guinea pig a-macroglobulin stimulated the amidolytic activity of trypsin towards a small substrate, but inhibited the proteolytic activity of trypsin towards remazol brilliant blue <b>hide</b> <b>powder.</b> When treated with trypsin or methylamine, four thiol groups per molecule were newly generated. The reaction with trypsin proceeded with at least at two different rates: half of the thiol groups were generated in a fast reaction and the remaining half in a slower reaction. On the other hand, such a two-step reaction was not detected in the reaction with methylamine. The methylamine-treated a-macroglobulin retained half the capacity to bind trypsin and its mobility in polyacrylamide gel under non...|$|E
40|$|Heretofore {{most studies}} {{dealing with the}} actions of enzymes on {{collagen}} {{have been carried out}} with the substrate in solid phase, for example, in suspension. However, in the course of an investigation undertaken in this laboratory employing a bacterial collagenase for the determination of some features of structure of a purified ichthyocol, the kinetic methods used, such as the measurement of changes of viscosity and optical rotation, required that the substmte initially be in solution without denaturation in a medium of neutral pH. Thus it was necessary to find methods by which to disperse collagen under neutral conditions and to redetermine some of the definitive physical and chemical properties of the solubilized protein in order to {{rule out the possibility that}} denaturation or gelatinization had occurred. Extraction of collagen from skins and from <b>hide</b> <b>powder</b> by socalled neutral salts, but under conditions predisposing to the denaturation of the protein, have been described (1). More recently, Gross, Highberger, and Schmitt (2); Harkness, Marko, Muir, and Neuberger (3); Neuberger (4); and Jackson an...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Concentrated culture filtrates from Bacillus subtilis, {{with high}} gelatinase activity, {{disintegrated}} <b>hide</b> <b>powder</b> although unable to attack native collagen; they also haemolysed the {{red blood cells}} {{of a number of}} species. The concentrated filtrates were dermonecrotic in rabbits and lethal on intravenous injection into mice. There was no conclusive evidence that the factors responsible for any of these effects were antigenic. Although each of the in vitro and in vivo activities was destroyed by heat, the haemolytic activity was more resistant than the others. Fresh normal sera from many species inhibited each of the three properties shown in vitro. Tests with gelatinase showed that inhibition occurred rapidly and in multiple proportions. The inhibitory action was diminished by heat and storage and was distinct from the antitryptic property of serum. It is well known that many species of the genus Bacillus have the property of liquefying gelatin, and Bertiau (1914) originally showed that the enzyme involved in this reaction was present in culture filtrates separated from the bacilli. The activities of the enzyme, apart from its ability to liquefy gelatin...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Fifty-three strains {{from six}} {{species of the}} genus Bacillus were tested {{for their ability to}} produce gelatinase and to {{disintegrate}} the collagen matrix of bone. Some strains of B. cereus and B. anthracis produced a true collagenase which brought about complete disinte,mtion of the collagen substrate, while strains of B. subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. brevis and B. megaterium were either completely inactive or produced only partial disintegration. Collagenase production was always accom-panied by gelatinase production but the reverse was not the case. Concentrated culture filtrates of B. cereus were shown to contain collagenase and gelatinase, whereas those of B. subtilis contained gelatinase only. In a previous communication (Evans & Wardlaw, 1952) we described some of the properties of proteolytic culture filtrates from a strain of Bacillus subtilis. The culture filtrates were highly active in liquefying gelatin and in disinte-grating <b>hide</b> <b>powder</b> which is a denatured form of skin collagen. The filtrates were, however, unable to break down undenatured tendon collagen either in the form of thin slices or thin sheets prepared from soluble collagen by th...|$|E
