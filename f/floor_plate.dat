25|$|The sonic {{hedgehog}} (SHH) signaling molecule assumes various {{roles in}} patterning {{the central nervous}} system (CNS) during vertebrate development. One of the most characterized functions of SHH is its role in the induction of the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> and diverse ventral cell types within the neural tube. The notochord, a structure derived from the axial mesoderm, produces SHH, which travels extracellularly to the ventral region of the neural tube and instructs those cells to form the <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b> Another view for <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> induction hypothesizes that some precursor cells located in the notochord are inserted into the neural plate before its formation, later giving rise to the <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sonic {{hedgehog}} is the secreted protein which mediates signaling {{activities of}} the notochord and <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b> Studies involving ectopic expression of SHH in vitro and in vivo result in <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> induction, and differentiation of motor neuron and ventral interneurons. On the other hand, mice mutant for SHH lack ventral spinal cord characteristics.In vitro blocking of SHH signaling using antibodies against it shows similar phenotypes. SHH exerts its effects in a concentration-dependent manner, so that {{a high concentration of}} SHH results in a local inhibition of cellular proliferation. This inhibition causes the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> to become thin compared to the lateral regions of the neural tube. Lower concentration of SHH results in cellular proliferation and induction of various ventral neural cell types. Once the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> is established, cells residing in this region will subsequently express SHH themselves generating a concentration gradient within the neural tube.|$|E
25|$|The neural tube {{itself is}} the initial groundwork of the {{vertebrate}} CNS, and the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> is a specialized structure and {{is located at the}} ventral midpoint of the neural tube. Evidence supporting the notochord as the signaling center comes from studies in which a second notochord is implanted near a neural tube in vivo, leading to the formation of an ectopic <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> within the neural tube.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} a system of precast <b>floor</b> <b>plates</b> from {{lightweight}} concrete intended mainly for building of family houses and residential construction. The developed system has two types of precast <b>floor</b> <b>plates</b> made from lightweight concrete: <b>floor</b> <b>plates</b> for <b>floor</b> systems and solid section <b>floor</b> <b>plates.</b> This paper describes solid section <b>floor</b> <b>plates.</b> The unambiguous advantage of lightweight concrete floor construction is weight lower {{by as much as}} 37 % compared to floor structure made from common concrete, while bearing strength remains unchanged as well as high fire resistance. This type of floor slabs has also been successful in the system of assembled prefabricated houses thanks to its lower weight and elimination of the wet construction process. Description of the structure- solid section floor slabs from lightweight concrete The <b>floor</b> <b>plates</b> are placed {{in the same way as}} a simple beam, they can be used for sail-over as well (double-sided Isokorb for precast elements made in the plant or composite structure, or a prefabricated slab with a "hollowing ” for balconies with additional monolithic casting on the construction site). These can be manufactured from lightweight (LC) of lightweight self-compacting concrete (SCLC) of class LC 25 / 28 D 1. 6 with expanded clay aggregate Liapor. <b>Floor</b> <b>plates</b> are 150, 180 and 250 mm thick with length of max. 2. 39 m.

25|$|DCC's role in commissural axon {{outgrowth}} {{is perhaps}} its best characterized. In the developing spinal cord, commissural neurons located dorsally extend axons ventrally using a mechanism {{dependent on a}} ventral midline structure, the <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b> A gradient of netrin-1 is produced from the <b>floor</b> <b>plate,</b> which allows orientation of the extending axons, aiding {{the development of the}} dorsal-ventral axis of the brain and spinal column. A variety of receptors are present on the axon surface which either repel or attract axons to the midline. When membrane DCC is stimulated by netrin-1, it promotes axon progression towards the midline.|$|E
25|$|Announcing its {{foray into}} the {{convenience}} sector in July 2008, Waitrose opened its first convenience store in Nottingham in December of that year. In September 2009, {{it was announced that}} a large scale rollout of the concept was planned, opening up to 300 stores in 5 to 10 years. The new arm will operate in a two-tier environment, with the majority of sites expected to trade from 2,500–3,000 sq ft and some trading from a larger 5,000–7,000 sq ft <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b> A trial of a 'little Waitrose' fascia on smaller <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> stores may yet lead to brand differentiation of {{some or all of the}} convenience estate.|$|E

25|$|The {{concentration}} and time-dependent, cell-fate-determining activity of SHH in the ventral neural tube {{makes it a}} prime example of a morphogen. In vertebrates, SHH signaling in the ventral portion of the neural tube is most notably responsible for the induction of <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> cells and motor neurons.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of low-density lipoprotein receptor type A (LDLrA) domains repeated ten {{times in the}} consensus sequence could provide a hint as to the function of SCORs, since LDLrA are known to interact with proteases or protease inhibitors. There may be a functional link between LDLrAs and SCORs, which could both {{be involved in the}} regulation of either protease activation or protease inhibition. The motifs coagulation factor 5/8 type C or discoidin and thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) present in SCO-spondin consensus were initially described in blood proteins, where they were shown {{to play a role in}} coagulation or platelet aggregation. SCO-spondin and F-spondin share a similar pattern of expression in the <b>floor</b> <b>plate,</b> flexural organ and subcommissural organ and could have a redundant activity. The biological function of F-spondin and SCO-spondin on the deflection of commissural axons in the neural tube was assessed respectivelly by experiments of gain and loss of function and by analyses of mutants with defective <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b> F-spondin and SCO-spondin were both shown to promote neurite outgrowth of various neuronal cell populations, in cell culture.|$|E

25|$|The {{magazines}} {{were also}} revised for the fifth-generation models. The redesigned magazine <b>floor</b> <b>plates</b> feature a frontward protruding lip to offer grip for manual assisted extraction and the magazine follower became orange colored for easier visual identification.|$|R
25|$|Alpha motor neurons {{originate}} in the basal plate, the ventral portion of the neural tube in the developing embryo. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is secreted by the nearby notochord and other ventral structures (e.g., the <b>floor</b> <b>plate),</b> establishing a gradient of highly concentrated Shh in the basal plate and less concentrated Shh in the alar plate. Under the influence of Shh and other factors, some neurons of the basal plate differentiate into α-MNs.|$|E
25|$|SHH {{emanates from}} the {{notochord}} and ventral <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> {{of the developing}} neural tube to create a concentration gradient that spans the dorso-ventral axis. Higher concentrations of the SHH ligand {{are found in the}} most ventral aspects of the neural tube and notochord, while lower concentrations are found in the more dorsal regions of the neural tube. The SHH concentration gradient has been visualized in the neural tube of mice engineered to express a SHH::GFP fusion protein to show this graded distribution of SHH during the time of ventral neural tube patterning.|$|E
25|$|The {{courtyard}} doughnut {{shape is}} critical to the two main design priorities: daylighting and natural ventilation. Natural daylighting was achieved through the shallow <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> depths and high ceilings allowing for light to penetrate the interior of the offices from both the exterior of the building and the core open-air courtyard. Daylighting models were tested at the University of Washington’s Integrated Design Lab to ensure even lighting and minimizing glare to users working on computers. Within the bulk of the building, daylight sensors are on all lighting within 15 feet of the windows and Energy Star equipment is provided to reduce the plug load.|$|E

50|$|The Capital Gate {{project was}} able to achieve its {{inclination}} through an engineering technique, known as pre-cambering, that allows <b>floor</b> <b>plates</b> to be stacked vertically up to the 12th storey, and staggered, one over another by between 300 mm to 1400 mm.|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} other {{molecules}} {{also involved in}} the guidance of axons to and across the midline. The slit proteins have repulsive functions, as opposed to netrins, and are mediated by the transmembrane protein Robo. Axonal growth cones that are attracted to the midline by netrin/DCC signaling eventually cross the <b>floor</b> <b>plate.</b> When this occurs they lose responsiveness to netrin and become repulsed by slit/Robo signaling. This is accomplished by {{the formation of a}} DCC-Robo complex, which inhibits attractive netrin/DCC signals while allowing slit/Robo signals. Netrin also has other receptors, the UNC-5 family. The UNC5 receptors have repellant migratory responses to netrin binding, and have similar effects to the slit/Robo system.|$|E

For jurisdictions which restrict magazine capacity to 10 rounds, Glock offers single-stack, 10-round magazines. The magazines are made of steel and are overmolded with plastic. A steel spring drives a plastic follower. After the last cartridge has been fired, the slide remains open on the slide stop. The slide stop release lever {{is located on the}} left side of the frame directly beneath the slide and can be manipulated by the thumb of the right-handed shooter.|$|E
25|$|On {{the topmost}} {{accessible}} {{floor of the}} Toronto-Dominion Bank Tower was a large indoor observation platform. As the tower was, when completed, the tallest in the city, this promontory once allowed uninterrupted views of the then quickly developing downtown core and of Lake Ontario to the south. This floor has since been converted to leased office space. On the level below is a restaurant {{on the south side}} and the Toronto-Dominion Bank corporate offices and boardroom are on the north. The interiors of the latter spaces were also designed by Mies and included his signature broad planes of rich, unadorned wood panelling, freestanding cabinets as partitions, wood slab desks, and some of his furniture pieces, such as the Barcelona chair, Barcelona ottoman, and Brno chair. Adjacent to the main boardroom at the northeast corner of the <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> and the Thompson Room at the northwest corner, service areas are concealed within the wood panelled walls behind secret panels.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of the}} {{embryonic}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} (eCSF), SCO-spondin is of the uttermost importance {{in the development of}} the neuronal system, being a key protein in the balancing of differentiation and proliferation of the neuroepithelium. It starts being secreted by the diencephalic <b>floor</b> <b>plate</b> in the first embryonic stages playing an important part in the development and differentiation of structures such as the pineal gland. In particular, the SCO-spondin appears to have a major role on the growth of the posterior commissure (PC), which was proved when mutants lacking SCO, and hence had no SCO-spondin, where unable to form a functional PC. On early stages of development the axonal growth is stimulated, being inhibited afterwards. A steep gradient of spondin expression in the neuroepithelium signals the need for different processes to take place, favoring the fasciculation on the cephalic region and the incorporation of new neurons on the caudal region. As such, the lower concentrations of SCO-spondin in the caudal region favor the axonal outgrowth and incorporation of new axons on the posterior commissure and the higher concentrations in the cephalic region promotes the interactions between the neighboring axons. In conjugation with the secretion of SCO-spondin, the midline positioning of the SCO assumes a great importance on the axon guidance process. This positioning facilitates the signaling of the turning points for the axons, through the spreading of spondin.|$|E
