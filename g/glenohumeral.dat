25|$|In {{arthritis}} of the shoulder, the cartilage of {{the ball}} and socket (<b>glenohumeral</b> joint) is lost so that bone rubs on bone.|$|E
25|$|Tendon {{transfers}} are {{prescribed for}} young, active cuff-tear patients who experience weakness and decreased range of motion, but little pain. The technique {{is not considered}} appropriate for older people, or those with pre-operative stiffness or nerve injuries. People diagnosed with <b>glenohumeral</b> arthritis and rotator cuff anthropathy often undergo hemiarthroplasty, which entails replacement of the humerus portion of the shoulder joint. Elderly patients with recurring cuff tears and degenerative <b>glenohumeral</b> arthritis sometimes receive total shoulder arthroplasty (replacement). Another surgery, reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, is effective for others.|$|E
25|$|The {{rotator cuff}} {{comprises}} four pennate muscles, the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis and teres minor, and their accompanying tendons. These muscles form a cuff around the <b>glenohumeral</b> joint and function to stabilize and manipulate the shoulder.|$|E
25|$|Shoulder (<b>Glenohumeral</b> joint) (shoulder) – Several weaker {{functions}} {{occur at}} the <b>glenohumeral,</b> or shoulder, joint. The biceps brachii weakly assists in forward flexion of the shoulder joint (bringing the arm forward and upwards). It may also contribute to abduction (bringing the arm out to the side) when the arm is externally (or laterally) rotated. The short head of the biceps brachii also assists with horizontal adduction (bringing the arm across the body) when the arm is internally (or medially) rotated. Finally, the short head of the biceps brachii, due to its attachment to the scapula (or shoulder blade), assists with stabilization of the shoulder joint when a heavy weight is carried in the arm. The tendon of the long head of the biceps also assists in holding {{the head of the}} humerus in the glenoid cavity.|$|E
25|$|The {{bones of}} the {{shoulder}} are {{held in place by}} muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Tendons are tough cords of tissue that attach the shoulder muscles to bone and assist the muscles in moving the shoulder. Ligaments attach shoulder bones to each other, providing stability. For example, the front of the joint capsule is anchored by three <b>glenohumeral</b> ligaments.|$|E
25|$|Abnormal {{scapular}} {{function is}} called scapular dyskinesis. One action the scapula performs during a throwing or serving motion is {{elevation of the}} acromion process {{in order to avoid}} impingement of the rotator cuff tendons. If the scapula fails to properly elevate the acromion, impingement may occur during the cocking and acceleration phase of an overhead activity. The two muscles most commonly inhibited during this first part of an overhead motion are the serratus anterior and the lower trapezius. These two muscles act as a force couple within the <b>glenohumeral</b> joint to properly elevate the acromion process, and if a muscle imbalance exists, shoulder impingement may develop.|$|E
25|$|The {{rotator cuff}} is an {{anatomical}} term {{given to the}} group of four muscles and their tendons that act to stabilize the shoulder. These muscles are the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis and that hold the head of the humerus in the glenoid cavity during movement. The cuff adheres to the <b>glenohumeral</b> capsule and attaches {{to the head of the}} humerus. Together, these keep the humeral head in the glenoid cavity, preventing upward migration of the humeral head caused by the pull of the deltoid muscle at the beginning of arm elevation. The infraspinatus and the teres minor, along with the anterior fibers of the deltoid muscle, are responsible for external rotation of the arm.|$|E
25|$|Almost all {{shoulder}} dislocations are downwards (inferior) and of these, 95% are in {{a forward}} direction. Clinically this {{is referred to as}} an anterior dislocation of the <b>glenohumeral</b> joint. Not only does the arm appear out of position when the shoulder dislocates, but the dislocation also produces pain. Muscle spasms may increase the intensity of pain. Swelling and bruising normally develop, and in some cases there may be numbness and muscle weakness. Problems seen with a dislocated shoulder are tearing of the ligaments or tendons reinforcing the joint capsule and, less commonly, nerve damage. Doctors usually diagnose a dislocation by a physical examination, but x rays are taken to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out a related fracture and other complications. X rays are also taken after relocation to ensure it is in the correct place.|$|E
25|$|The scapula is a wide, flat bone {{lying on}} the {{thoracic}} wall that provides an attachment for three different groups of muscles. The intrinsic muscles of the scapula include {{the muscles of the}} rotator cuff—the subscapularis, teres minor, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus. These muscles attach {{to the surface of the}} scapula and are responsible for the internal and external rotation of the shoulder joint, along with humeral abduction. The extrinsic muscles include the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles and attach to the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, and spine of the scapula. These muscles are responsible for several actions of the <b>glenohumeral</b> joint. The third group, which is mainly responsible for stabilization and rotation of the scapula, consists of the trapezius, serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles and attach to the medial, superior, and inferior borders of the scapula.|$|E
25|$|The {{shoulder}} {{consists of}} a ball-and-socket joint formed by the humerus and scapula and their surrounding structures - ligaments, muscles, tendons - which support the bones and maintain the relationship of one to another. These supporting structures attach to the clavicle, humerus, and scapula, the latter providing the glenoid cavity, acromion and coracoid processes. The main joint of the shoulder is the shoulder joint (or <b>glenohumeral</b> joint), between the humerus and the glenoid process of the scapular. The acromioclavicular joint and sternoclavicular joint {{also play a role}} in shoulder movements. White hyaline cartilage on the ends of the bones (called articular cartilage) allows the bones to glide and move on each other, and the joint space is surrounded by a synovial membrane. Around the joint space are muscles - the rotator cuff, which directly surrounds and attaches to the shoulder joint - and other muscles that help provide stability and facilitate movement.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{examination}} of the shoulder to feel for injury and discover the limits of movement, location of pain, and extent of joint instability. The steps to elicit this information are inspection (looking), palpation (feeling), testing range of motion, and performing special maneuvers. Information collected on inspection are asymmetry, atrophy, ecchymosis, scars, swelling, and venous distention. Palpation can help find pain and deformities, and should specifically include the anterior <b>glenohumeral</b> joint, acromioclavicular joint, biceps tendon, cervical spine, coracoid process, scapula, and sternoclavicular joint. Range of motion tests external and internal rotation, abduction and adduction, passive and active weakness, and true weakness versus weakness due to pain. The Apley scratch test is the most useful: touch opposite scapular by reaching behind the head for adduction and external rotation and behind the back for abduction and internal rotation. Finally, there are more specific maneuvers that can hone in on a diagnosis, however their accuracy is limited.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shoulder}} joint (also {{known as the}} <b>glenohumeral</b> joint) is the main joint of the shoulder. [...] It is a {{ball and socket joint}} that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body. [...] The capsule is a soft tissue envelope that encircles the <b>glenohumeral</b> joint and attaches to the scapula, humerus, and head of the biceps. It is lined by a thin, smooth synovial membrane. The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles that surround the {{shoulder joint}} and contribute to the shoulder's stability. The muscles of the rotator cuff are supraspinatus, subscapularis, infraspinatus, and teres minor. The cuff adheres to the <b>glenohumeral</b> capsule and attaches to the humeral head.|$|E
2500|$|The capsule is a {{soft tissue}} {{envelope}} that encircles the <b>glenohumeral</b> joint and {{attaches to the}} scapula, humerus, {{and head of the}} biceps. It is lined by a thin, smooth synovial membrane. [...] This capsule is strengthened by the coracohumeral ligament which attaches the coracoid process of the scapula to the greater tubercle of the humerus. [...] There are also three other ligaments attaching the lesser tubercle of the humerus to lateral scapula and are collectively called the <b>glenohumeral</b> ligaments.|$|E
2500|$|The cuff is {{responsible}} for stabilizing the <b>glenohumeral</b> joint, abducting, externally rotating, and internally rotating the humerus. [...] When shoulder trauma occurs, these functions can be compromised. [...] Because individuals are highly dependent on the shoulder for many activities, overuse of the muscles can lead to tears, the vast majority again occurring in the supraspinatus tendon.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shoulder}} joint {{is composed of}} three bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone) (see diagram). Two joints facilitate shoulder movement. The acromioclavicular (AC) joint is located between the acromion (part of the scapula that forms the highest point of the shoulder) and the clavicle. The <b>glenohumeral</b> joint, to which the term [...] "{{shoulder joint}}" [...] commonly refers, is a ball-and-socket joint that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body. The [...] "ball" [...] is the top, rounded portion of the upper arm bone or humerus; the [...] "socket," [...] or glenoid, is a dish-shaped part of {{the outer edge of}} the scapula into which the ball fits. [...] Arm movement is further facilitated by the ability of the scapula itself to slide along the rib cage. [...] The capsule is a soft tissue envelope that encircles the <b>glenohumeral</b> joint. It is lined by a thin, smooth synovial membrane.|$|E
2500|$|The four tendons {{of these}} muscles {{converge}} {{to form the}} rotator cuff tendon. [...] This tendon, along with the articular capsule, the coracohumeral ligament, and the <b>glenohumeral</b> ligament complex, blend into a confluent sheet before insertion into the humeral tuberosities. [...] The infraspinatus and teres minor fuse near their musculotendinous junctions, while the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons join as a sheath that surrounds the biceps tendon {{at the entrance of}} the bicipital groove.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Glenohumeral</b> (or shoulder) {{subluxation}} {{is defined}} as a partial or incomplete dislocation of the shoulder joint that typically results from changes in the mechanical integrity of the joint. [...] Subluxation is a common problem with hemiplegia, or weakness of the musculature of the upper limb. [...] Traditionally this has been thought to be a significant cause of post-stroke shoulder pain, although a few recent studies have failed to show a direct correlation between shoulder subluxation and pain.|$|E
2500|$|The human {{shoulder}} {{is made up}} {{of three}} bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone) as well as associated muscles, ligaments and tendons. [...] The articulations between the bones of the shoulder make up the shoulder joints. The shoulder joint also known as the <b>glenohumeral</b> joint, is the major joint of the shoulder, but can more broadly include the acromioclavicular joint. In human anatomy, the shoulder joint comprises the part of the body where the humerus attaches to the scapula, the head sitting in the glenoid cavity. The shoulder is the group of structures in the region of the joint.|$|E
2500|$|That is {{followed}} by the [...] "proliferative" [...] and [...] "maturation and remodeling" [...] phases of healing, which ensues for the following six to ten weeks. The effect of active or passive motion during any of the phases is unclear, due to conflicting information and a shortage of clinical evidence. [...] Gentle physical therapy guided motion is instituted at this phase, only to prevent stiffness of the shoulder; the rotator cuff remains fragile. At three months after surgery, physical therapy intervention changes substantially to focus on scapular mobilization and stretching of the <b>glenohumeral</b> joint. [...] Once full passive motion is regained (at usually about four to four and a half months after surgery) strengthening exercises are the focus. [...] The strengthening focuses on the rotator cuff and the upper back/scapular stabilizers. [...] Typically at about six months after surgery, most patients have made a majority of the gains.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shoulder}} joint (also {{known as the}} <b>glenohumeral</b> joint) is the main joint of the shoulder. It is a {{ball and socket joint}} that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body. [...] It is formed by the articulation between the head of the humerus and the lateral scapula (specifically-the glenoid cavity of the scapula). [...] The [...] "ball" [...] of the joint is the rounded, medial anterior surface of the humerus and the [...] "socket" [...] is formed by the glenoid cavity, the dish-shaped portion of the lateral scapula. [...] The shallowness of the cavity and relatively loose connections between the shoulder {{and the rest of the}} body allows the arm to have tremendous mobility, at the expense of being much easier to dislocate than most other joints in the body. There is an approximately 4-to-1 disproportion in size between the large head of the humerus and the shallow glenoid cavity.The glenoid cavity is made deeper by the addition of the fibrocartilaginous ring of the glenoid labrum.|$|E
2500|$|X-ray projectional {{radiography}} cannot directly reveal {{tears of}} the rotator cuff, a 'soft tissue', and consequently, normal X-rays cannot exclude a damaged cuff. However, indirect evidence of pathology {{may be seen}} in instances where {{one or more of the}} tendons have undergone degenerative calcification (calcific tendinitis). The humeral head may migrate upwards (high-riding humeral head) secondary to tears of the infraspinatus, or combined tears of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. Prolonged contact between a high-riding humeral head and the acromion above it, may lead to X-rays findings of wear on the humeral head and acromion and secondary degenerative arthritis of the <b>glenohumeral</b> joint (the ball and socket joint of the shoulder), called cuff arthropathy, may follow. Incidental X-ray [...] findings of bone spurs at the adjacent acromioclavicular joint may show a bone spur growing from the outer edge of the clavicle downwards towards the rotator cuff. Spurs may also be seen on the underside of the acromion, once thought to cause direct fraying of the rotator cuff from contact friction, a concept currently regarded as controversial.|$|E
