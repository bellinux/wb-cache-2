40|$|Variable annuities, as a {{class of}} {{retirement}} income products, allow equity market exposure for a policyholder's retirement fund with electable additional guarantees to limit the downside risk of the market. Management <b>fees</b> and <b>guarantee</b> insurance <b>fees</b> are charged respectively for the market exposure and for the protection from the downside risk. We investigate the impact of management fees on the pricing of variable annuity guarantees under optimal withdrawal strategies. Two optimal strategies, from policyholder's and from insurer's perspectives, are respectively formulated and the corresponding pricing problems are solved using dynamic programming. Our results show that when management fees are present, the two strategies can deviate significantly from each other, leading to a substantial difference of the <b>guarantee</b> insurance <b>fees.</b> This provides a possible explanation of lower <b>guarantee</b> insurance <b>fees</b> observed in the market. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate our results...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Examining {{corporate}} investment in low-income housing tax credits reveals that firms {{are willing to}} incur costs in order to manage the income statement classifi-cation of an expense. Accounting rules allow investors who purchase a tax benefit guarantee to amortize their equity in a real estate partnership as a tax expense, {{rather than as an}} operating expense, thus avoiding a reduction in pre-tax earnings. Using confidential data from tax credit syndicators, I model the market price of a tax credit {{as a function of the}} existence of the guarantee, controlling for foreclosure risk on the underlying real estate. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that an econom-ically significant amount of the <b>guarantee</b> <b>fee</b> is paid by corporate investors for the right to use an accounting method that avoids reductions in pre-tax earnings...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Needs-based collateralized debt {{obligation}} (CDO) satisfies constraints, such as {{the priority}} of tranches and investor needs for the merchantability of tranches, while creating capital-loss risk that is attributable to the excess and the deficiency of redemption money. We analyzed how relaxing the priority constraint for tranches decreases the risk of capital-loss and decreases the standard deviation {{in the amount of}} gain or loss. Relaxing the priority constraint enables us to assign redemption money to each tranche more flexibly and {{to reduce the amount of}} difference between the repayment money from underlying obligations and the redemption money. Experimental tests indicate that raising the degree of relaxation for the constraint reduces the standard deviation in the amount of gain or loss to one-eighth of its original value, which is worth the <b>guarantee</b> <b>fee</b> paid to the risk receiver.

40|$|We {{explore the}} capital {{structure}} and governance of a mortgage-insuring securitization utility operating with government reinsurance for systemic or 'tail' risk. The structure we propose for {{the replacement of}} the GSEs focuses on aligning incentives for appropriate pricing and transfer of mortgage risks across the private sector and between the private sector and the government. We present the justification and mechanics of a vintage-based capital structure, and assess the components of the mortgage <b>guarantee</b> <b>fee,</b> whose size we find is most sensitive to the required capital ratio and the expected return on that capital. We discuss the implications of selling off some of the utility's mortgage credit risk to the capital markets and how the informational value of such transactions may vary with the level of risk transfer. Finally, we explore how mutualization could address incentive misalignments arising out of securitization and government insurance, as well as how the governance structure for such a financial market utility could be designed...|$|E

40|$|Elements of {{the scheme}} In May, the German {{government}} has {{decided on the}} draft of a law for establishing so-called “Bad Banks ” (Bundesregierung 2009).

These assets must have been acquired before Jan. 1, 2009. 2.

40|$|Policyholder {{exercise}} behavior {{presents an}} important {{risk factor for}} life insurance companies. Yet, most approaches presented in the academic literature – building on value maximizing strategies akin to the valuation of American options – do not square well with observed prices and exercise patterns. Following a recent strand of literature, {{in order to gain}} insights on what drives policyholder behavior, I first develop a life-cycle model for variable annuities (VA) with withdrawal guarantees. However, I explicitly allow for outside savings and investments, which considerably affects the results. Specifically, I find that withdrawal patterns after all are primarily motivated by value maximization – but with the important asterisk that the value maximization should be taken out from the policyholders’ perspective accounting for individual tax benefits. To this effect, I develop a risk-neutral valuation methodology that takes these different tax structures into consideration, and apply it to our example contract as well as a representative empirical VA. The results are in line with corresponding outcomes from the life cycle model, and I find that the withdrawal <b>guarantee</b> <b>fee</b> from the empirical product roughly accords with its marginal price to the insurer. I further consider the implications of policyholder behavior on product design. In particular – due to differential tax treatments and contrary to option pricing theory – the marginal value of such guarantees can become negative, even when the holder is a value maximizer. For instance, as I illustrate with both a simple two-period model and an empirical VA, a common death benefit guarantee may indeed yield a negative marginal value to the insurer...|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the role and}} effectiveness of a credit guarantee scheme targeting coffee farmers’ cooperatives in Ethiopia. The study, among other things, aims at exploring how provision of a credit guarantee influences supply of institutional credit to coffee farmers’ cooperatives as well as examines cooperatives guaranteed loan utilisation, the resultant changes/impacts and intervening factors. Credit guarantee schemes largely trace their roots in the liberal and neoliberal economic and social contexts. One of the key issues the current study tried to address is examining how a credit guarantee scheme operates in a partially liberal capitalist context where there is pervasive state intervention in the key sectors of the economy, including financial and coffee sectors. The {{study was conducted in}} eight zones of the two major coffee producing regions of Ethiopia – Oromia and Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples’ regions. A mixed method with structured questionnaires (at two stages), key informant interviews, focus group discussions and extensive observation were used to collect data from primary cooperatives, financial institutions, coffee extension and cooperative experts. Qualitative analytical methods, descriptive statistics and econometric model were used in analysing the data. The study reveals that most primary cooperatives have weak institutional, business and financial capacities, and limited access to institutional services including credit. The findings show that cooperatives generally have limited role in the coffee production end, but they {{play an important role in}} its marketing. The study suggests that coffee or multipurpose cooperatives are not ideally suitable to serve as intermediaries for bank loans. The study reveals that the vast majority of the study cooperatives have potential demand for loans, but revealed low actual demand. Different sets of internal (demand side) and external factors influence cooperatives’ potential and actual demand for loan in different ways. The assessment of the guarantee scheme under analysis shows that though most of its design and operational features are in line with international practices, there are some obvious limitations. Low risk coverage level, limitation in the total volume of the guarantee fund, lack of capital enhancement mechanism for the lending banks, short life span of the scheme, lack of flexibility and adaptation and reliance on a single lending bank are among the notable limitations. In terms of utilisation of the guarantee fund and outreach of the lending activity, the scheme attained limited achievements with a low leverage ratio. However, substantial financial additionality was attained among the borrower cooperatives, but the intervention had little impacts in improving the terms and conditions of loans. The positive effects on the economic/business activities of beneficiary cooperatives include acquisition of processing facilities, increase in member size, increased volume of coffee processed and dry cherry traded and improvement in the income generated from such business activities. However, the scheme had limited effects on cooperatives’ human resources and type of management. A number of internal and external factors appear to influence effectiveness of a credit guarantee targeting farmers’ cooperatives. Several recommendations were made. First, there is a need to integrate attractive features into the scheme that can be periodically revised and adapted. These may include raising the risk coverage level especially at the initial stage, including liquidity boosting mechanism, lowering <b>guarantee</b> <b>fee</b> level, devising longer-term arrangement, integrating strong capacity building and technical support and other incentive packages. Second, the lending banks need to develop suitable loan products, revisit and improve their lending terms, requirements and approaches. Third, if they are to effectively demand for and make proper use of such guaranteed loans, cooperatives need to be supported so as to enhance their organisational, business and technical capacities. Fourth, there is a need for the government to further strengthen provision of a more supportive and enabling legal and institutional environments and relax some of the regulatory frameworks so as to facilitate the lending-borrowing activities.
