40|$|The {{applicability}} of mercury vapour lights as an attractant of fish to the modified fish <b>handling</b> <b>pump</b> (Tempering pump No 8) in the Nanticoke TGS forebay was assessed. Acoustic fish census equipment {{was used to}} assess attraction of fish to the lights while a trawl net was used to collect fish passing through the pump. The mercury vapour lights successfully attracted fish in the forebay to the area of the bar racks. Although it appeared that many fish escaped capture in the trawl net due to mesh size and flow characteristics, catches were higher when mercury vapour lights were used to illuminate the outside and inside of the bar racks for 5 minutes. Although further tests should be conducted, it appears that in the absence of tempering, a combination of mercury vapour and strobe lights will increase the quantity of fish passing through Tempering Pump No 8...|$|E

5000|$|... "Cold ironing" [...] is {{specifically}} a shipping industry term {{that came into}} use when all ships had coal-fired engines. When a ship tied up at port, {{there was no need}} to continue to feed the fire and the iron engines would literally cool down, eventually going completely cold - hence the term [...] "cold ironing". If commercial ships can use shore-supplied power for services such as cargo <b>handling,</b> <b>pumping,</b> ventilation and lighting while in port, they need not run their own diesel engines, reducing air pollution emissions.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{village of}} Short Pump {{is located at}} the intersection of Three Chopt Road (formerly known as Three Notched Trail), Richmond Turnpike and Pouncey Tract Road. It was named for the short <b>handled</b> <b>pump</b> that was located beneath the porch of a tavern located there. The tavern was built by Robert Hyde Saunders, a Revolutionary War veteran in 1815. This area was on the principal route between Richmond and Charlottesville, as well as other towns in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Thomas Jefferson, the Earl Cornwallis, the Marquis de Lafayette, General Peter Muhlenberg, Stonewall Jackson and Ulric Dahlgren all visited this area.|$|R

50|$|The springy {{branch of}} a nearby pine tree bothers Donald in his sleep and is smacked back by it {{when he tries to}} shove it away. Angered, Donald fixes a dry tree branch under the pine's branch to keep it away. As Donald sleeps, however, his exhalations make the dry tree branch lose hold on the pine's branch, causing it to hit the pump (with the hose still {{attached}} to the mattress' valve) and wobble up and down with the <b>handle,</b> <b>pumping</b> fast and strongly. This causes Donald's mattress to get excessively inflated until it dispatches and takes off, deflating away while Donald continues to sleep.|$|R

50|$|Most modern pumps have an auto cut-off {{feature that}} stops the flow when the tank is full.

50|$|The pump's primary {{components}} {{consist of}} the <b>pump</b> <b>handle,</b> the riser main which carries {{the water to}} the surface, the pump cylinder which pushes water up the riser main, and the connecting rod which connects the <b>pump</b> <b>handle</b> to the <b>pump</b> cylinder {{at the bottom of}} the well. After a borehole is drilled, a well casing is inserted into the hole to prevent the erosion of the borehole walls. The India Mark II needs a borehole with a minimum diameter of 10 cm. The casing has a well screen to allow water to pass into the casing but keeps rocks and dirt out. A pump cylinder is attached to the bottom of a series of pipes call riser mains or riser pipes and sits below the water surface in the well once installed. The riser main will carry the water from the pump cylinder to the surface. Inside the riser main, a series of rods connect the <b>pump</b> <b>handle</b> to the top of the pump cylinder {{at the bottom of the}} well. The reciprocating up and down movement of the <b>pump</b> <b>handle</b> raises and lowers the connecting rod thus raising and lowering the plunger of the pump cylinder. Two one-way water valves inside the cylinder suck water into the cylinder on the upstroke and force the water into the riser main on the down stroke. Water flows up the riser main and out of the spout at the top of the well head assembly.|$|R

The hydraulic system is controlled by a <b>pump</b> <b>handle.</b> As the <b>pump</b> <b>handle</b> is operated the actuator piston rod is forced outward and thus the cutting jaws are forced together. The frame of the device is a flexible metal tubing which permits easy positioning of the tool cutting jaws in remote and normally inaccessible locations. Bifurcated cutting edges ensure removal of a section of the tubing or cable to thereby reduce the possibility of accidental reactivation of the tubing or cable being severed...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 1 Froth is {{the basis}} to the {{extraction}} of bitumen from oil sand. Its components include sand, bitumen, water, and air. The technology of extraction and processing is evolving toward lower temperature of operation where the volumetric content of air and viscosity of bitumen challenge pumping. To improve the efficiency of froth <b>handling</b> <b>pumps</b> {{it is important to}} adapt the technology from other industries. This may include degassing while pumping with secondary vacuum impellers (expellers), recirculating a part of the slurry to the suction, or injecting external hot water. In an effort to reduce air locking problems and derating of performance, a special impeller for centrifugal pumps was developed. The impellers feature split vanes between the principal vanes. The design allows for adequate passageway for solids at the eye while reducing the formation of large pockets of air between the main vanes. Adequate vane thickness for principal and split canes in maintained in this design to resist wear from sand...|$|R
5000|$|There is {{disagreement}} about whether [...] "pikuach nefesh overrides" [...] {{would apply to}} halting a specific, identifiable, immediate, and well-known ongoing threat in a well-identified community, given the advent of public health, like the disablement of the Broad Street pump in the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak, as reported by John Snow. The Broad Street Pump posed an immediate risk to many lives, with no specific individual identified as at threat. Instead, everyone living {{close enough to the}} Broad Street pump to draw water from the infective source was in life-threatening danger any time they grew thirsty and craved a drink of water. John Snow identified the Broad Street pump as problematic on a Thursday (September 7, 1854), and the <b>pump</b> <b>handle</b> was removed on a Friday (September 8, 1854) by members of the community. To definitively disable the pump as the Broad Street community did that Friday after Shabbat began, an observant Jew, whether acting on confirmed conscience alone or short-handed, would have to suspend Shabbat under pikuach nefesh, remove the <b>pump</b> <b>handle,</b> surround, cordon off, and/or by some other means prevent use of the <b>pump</b> <b>handle</b> without interruption through the night and following day to guarantee that no further water was drawn from the deadly and infectious Broad Street Pump, as an immediate, ongoing threat to life. Under the narrowest interpretation of pikuach nefesh, an observant Jew must wait until a passerby makes contact with the <b>pump</b> <b>handle,</b> and clearly expresses an intention to pump, in order to suspend Shabbat on a pikuach nefesh (PN) override. (Historically, it is not known whether the community removed the <b>pump</b> <b>handle</b> before or after sunset, and the beginning of Shabbat. [...] ) ...|$|R
40|$|Self-priming solid-handling {{centrifugal}} pumps {{are used in}} many industrial and civil applications for the transport of slurries and fluid with suspensions. This class of pumps has to undergo restrictive geometrical and structural constraints (reduced number of blades, device for the selfpriming, high mechanical resistance) which usually do not allow an optimal fluid dynamic design. This is mainly {{due to the fact}} that the usual methods of investigation for these pumps are either not reliable (one-dimensional and/or similarity analysis) or can require large time effort (experimental campaign). In this paper, a numerical integrated procedure developed for the study of two blades selfpriming solid-handling {{centrifugal pumps}} and performed by means of the CFX-Tascflow numerical code, has been carried out on a particular class of solid <b>handling</b> <b>pumps.</b> A number of variations of the blade geometry is considered and studied numerically.
