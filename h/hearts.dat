5|$|Having {{finished}} in {{the top half of the}} 2011–12 Scottish Premier League, <b>Hearts</b> were involved in the battle to qualify for the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League competition. A victory against St Johnstone in their penultimate league match lifted <b>Hearts</b> into fifth place, a qualifying position. <b>Hearts</b> then rested some players for their final league match, a 5–0 defeat by Celtic. Entering the week before the cup final, <b>Hearts</b> had concerns about the fitness of striker Craig Beattie, who was unable to train due to a hamstring injury.|$|E
5|$|In {{the quarter}} final <b>Hearts</b> faced another SPL side, St Mirren. <b>Hearts</b> conceded early on after a Graham Carey free-kick before Craig Beattie scored {{and then set}} up Rudi Skácel to put <b>Hearts</b> in front. Zaliukas then scored a late own goal after {{deflecting}} a Nigel Hasselbaink shot into his own net to level the match. In the replay at St Mirren Park, Carey had an early penalty saved, after a handball by Zaliukas, and Hasselbaink then scored a goal which was ruled out because the referee had not given St Mirren an advantage. <b>Hearts</b> then {{came back into the}} match as Hamill and Skácel scored to give <b>Hearts</b> a 2-0 win. In the semi-final at Hampden Park, <b>Hearts</b> were drawn against cup holders Celtic. Skácel scored shortly after half-time for <b>Hearts</b> before Gary Hooper scored a late equaliser for Celtic. <b>Hearts</b> were then awarded a stoppage-time penalty which former Celtic striker Beattie converted. There was controversy around both Hooper's goal and Beattie's penalty after the match as Hooper had looked offside when he scored his goal and Hearts' penalty was considered to have been wrongly awarded by the referee.|$|E
