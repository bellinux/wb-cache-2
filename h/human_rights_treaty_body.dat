Secondly, the Committee delivered its first communication, finding against the government of Kenya in regard to the right to nationality (amongst other rights) of Nubian children in Kenya. These two activities are major highlights for the Committee in the execution of its mandate.

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} Article 33 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). Article 33 {{requires}} states {{to set up}} a framework, located both within and outside of government, to guide and monitor the implementation of the CRPD. It is a novel development in international law, which generally leaves implementation up to the states. This thesis looks at the history of human rights law and past reform efforts, to put Article 33 in the proper context. The problems with implementing human rights treaties, and the development of human rights law are documented. Past reform efforts, such as the effort to reform the UN <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>treaty</b> <b>body</b> system, are studied to better understand the difficulties in improving human rights law. The development of National Human Rights Institutions is also looked at in great detail, as their rise in numbers is crucial to the creation of Article 33. It then looks at the development of Article 33, to determine why it took the form that it did. Finally, the use of Article 33 by states is studied, with an eye to determining how Article 33 can change the relationship between states and international human rights law, and how it can improve the implementation of human rights treaties. 2016 - 10 - 2...|$|E

Contrary to popular perception that the U. S. thumbs its nose at these bodies, the U. S. in fact engages quite actively with their human rights procedures. To untangle the associated issues, the Article proceeds in six parts. Part I begins by reviewing the current legal framework that structures U.

S. in fact engages with the three principal supervisory competences exercised by UN, OAS, and ILO treaty body systems: periodic reporting, quasi-adjudication, and promotional activities. Part III considers the countervailing push-pull pressures that influence and shape U. S. engagement policy at the foreign-policy and domestic-policy levels, respectively, while Part IV identifies the three principal mediating techniques the U. S. employs to accommodate these competing pressures. These mediating techniques, which draw heavily, if selectively, on the formalized rules of international human rights law 2 ̆ 7 s subsidiarity principle allow the U. S. to pursue a framework policy toward treaty body engagement that at once permits active U. S. engagement with international procedures, appeases conservative critiques of such engagement (at both domestic and foreign-policy levels), and allows the U. S. to remain technically compliant with its externally-oriented treaty obligations. What it does not do, as currently pursued, is facilitate internal domestic reflection on the nation 2 ̆ 7 s treaty-based human rights commitments. Indeed, responsive to the dominant pressures exerted on U. S. policymakers from both within and without government (from institutionalists, realists, and insulationists), these mediating techniques draw on only half of subsidiarity 2 ̆ 7 s blueprint. Part V discusses this conflict, the structural opportunities for addressing it, and the importance of giving the principle of subsidiarity its full and intended meaning in international human rights law. The piece concludes by looking at where U. S. policy can be expected to lead in coming years, as U. S. policymakers continue to chart a middle course through difficult and shifting pressures. This middle course is one that does not reject, but rather solidly embraces supervisory <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>treaty</b> <b>body</b> processes, albeit under a vision of their jurisdiction as strictly subsidiary to domestic decision-making processes.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between human rights law and {{international humanitarian law}} (IHL) has received {{a great deal of}} scholarly attention. Commentators note the increased presence of IHL in the work of human rights bodies. There remains an interesting gap in the debate, however: while human rights bodies may be referencing international humanitarian law, what are they doing with it? To what extent are they interpreting its protections under a human rights framework? Are they performing substantive or precedential analysis of IHL? This article addresses one measure of that gap by comprehensively examining the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) {{as it relates to the}} interpretation of international humanitarian law. This article finds that the CRC has incorporated the corpus of IHL into the Children 2 ̆ 7 s Convention and argues that it has an important role to play in interpreting international humanitarian law. The Children 2 ̆ 7 s Convention is the only core international human rights treaty that discusses humanitarian law explicitly and has an interpretive body to monitor its implementation. As a result, the CRC is the only <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> <b>treaty</b> <b>body</b> with a substantial existing humanitarian law jurisprudence. Further, the CRC considers reports from States under the Optional Protocol on Children in Armed Conflict, which recalls in its preamble the obligation of States parties “to abide by the provisions of international humanitarian law. ” These features suggest that the CRC has unique institutional potential to interpret humanitarian law. Yet while the CRC offers analysis of IHL, its analysis is implicit. It is possible, by assembling various pronouncements in the Concluding Observations, to find examples of States parties’ obligations under IHL as they relate to respect for and protection of children. Nonetheless, the Committee’s structure and mandate prevent it from performing fact-specific and potentially precedential analysis. Still, we argue that the Committee may be able to modify slightly the format of its Concluding Observations in order to provide more explicit links from IHL to the Convention. Moreover, through its consistent pronouncements as to certain mandatory protections for children in situations of armed conflict, the Committee may be developing and solidifying norms of customary international humanitarian law...|$|E
