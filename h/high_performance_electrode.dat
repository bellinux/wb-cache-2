Such atomic rearrangement arises from the anisotropic lithium diffusion and is accompanied by appearance of partial dislocations.

Especially, with the fast development of portable electronic devices with lightweight and flexible designs, the research on flexible storage devices becomes very important. The key research of supercapacitors is developing novel electrode materials with good specific capacitance and cycling stability plus high power density. It has been well established that nanostructured electrode designs can enhance both the power density (or rate capability) and cycling stability. Although {{a wide variety of}} nanostructures have been created and tested, it still represents a grand challenge to enhancing the capacity, maintaining the excellent rate capability and charge-discharge cycling life[10, 11]. Ternary nickel cobaltite (NiCo 2 O 4) has recently been investigated as a <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> <b>electrode</b> material for SCs because of its better electrical conductivity and higher electrochemical activity compared to binary nickel oxide (NiO) and cobalt oxide (Co 3 O 4)[12].

40|$|The {{moisture}} content of Î²-nickel hydroxide samples obtained by strong alkali precipitation from nickel salt solutions varies {{as a function}} of the pH at precipitation. A low (7 - 9) pH at precipitation yields nickel hydroxides with 5 - 6 {{moisture content}}, whereas a high (> 13) pH at precipitation yields a moisture content of nearly 12. In all cases, the moisture content is lost at moderate (65 - 125 Â°C) temperatures but is restored on cooling and equilibration (24 h) in the ambient. The restoration of the original moisture content in its entirely in all samples shows that the nickel hydroxide phases obtained at low and high pH are distinct from each other. DlFFaX simulations show that the phases with different moisture contents differ in the degree of turbostratic disorder and the proportion of Î±-phase interstratified by them; the high moisture content phase has a higher proportion of the Î±-motifs. This is reflected in the characteristic broadening of lines in the power X-ray diffraction patterns of the two phases. The high moisture content hydroxide delivers a higher (385 mAh g- 1 of Ni) (0. 85 e- exchange) reversible discharge capacity compared to the low moisture content sample (185 mAh g- 1) (0. 4 e- exchange) in foam pasted electrodes.

40|$|The W-Cu pseudo-alloy is a {{very useful}} {{material}} for electrical discharge machining (EDM) electrodes because they have high thermal and electric conductivity, high strength, good wear resistance and exceptional arc erosion resistance, combined with low thermal expansion coefficients. Various types of tungsten coated copper powders (W-Cu with 20 to 35 wt- % copper) are used to fabricate W-Cu EDM electrodes. The optimum sintering condition to provide for a <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> W-Cu <b>electrode</b> is investigated. The thermal and mechanical properties of the W-Cu electrode are measured and compared with the more classic infiltrated W-Cu and simple extruded copper. The effects of copper content on the W-Cu electrodes with respect to wear and life are investigated under actual EDM conditions. Finally, the excellent <b>performance</b> of W-Cu <b>electrode</b> by tungsten coated copper powders on the EDM is verified...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objectives of}} the program were development of a durable, low cost, <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> cathode <b>electrode</b> (catalyst and support), that is fully integrated into a fuel cell membrane electrode assembly with gas diffusion media, fabricated by high volume capable processes, {{and is able to}} meet or exceed the 2015 DOE targets. Work completed in this contract was an extension of the developments under three preceding cooperative agreements/grants Nos. DE-FC- 02 - 97 EE 50473, DE-FC- 99 EE 50582 and DE-FC 36 - 02 AL 67621 which investigated catalyzed membrane electrode assemblies for PEM fuel cells based on a fundamentally new, nanostructured thin film catalyst and support system, and demonstrated the feasibility for high volume manufacturability...|$|R
5000|$|Current density-voltage ( [...] j-V) {{curves and}} {{impedance}} spectra are investigated and recorded. Impedancespectra are realized applying an ac current of 1-2A RMS (root-mean-square) {{in the frequency}} range from 30 kHzto 10−1 Hz. Impedance spectra shows that the resistance is high at low frequencies(<10 kHz) and near zero at high frequencies(>10 kHz). [...] Since high frequency corresponds to electrolyte activities, while low frequencies corresponds to electrodes process, it can be deduced {{that only a small}} fraction of the overall resistance is from the electrolyte and most resistance comes from anode and cathode. Hence, developing <b>high</b> <b>performance</b> <b>electrodes</b> are essential for high efficiency SORFC. Area specific resistance(ASR) can be obtained from the slope of j-V curve. Commonly used/tested electrodes materials are nickel/zirconia cermet (Ni/YSZ) and lanthanum-substituted strontium titanate/ceria composite for SORFC cathode, and lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) for SORFC anode. Other anode materials can be lanthanum strontium ferrite(LSF), lanthanum strontium copper ferrite(LSCuF) and lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCoF). Studies show that Ni/YSZ electrode was less active in reverse fuel cell operation than in fuel cell operation,and this can be attributed to a diffusion-limited process in the electrolysis direction, or its susceptibility to aging in a high-steam environment,primarily due to coarsening of nickel particles. Therefore, alternative materials such as the titanate/ceria composite (La0.35Sr0.65TiO3-Ce0.5La0.5O2−δ)or (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95Mn0.5Cr0.5O3 (LSCM) have been proposed electrolysis cathodes.Both LSF and LSM/YSZ are reported as good anode candidates for electrolysis mode. Furthermore,higher operation temperature and higher absolute humidity ratio(AH) can result in lower ASR.|$|R
