50|$|<b>Geoffroy's</b> <b>cat</b> (Leopardus geoffroyi) is a {{wild cat}} {{native to the}} {{southern}} and central regions of South America. It {{is about the size}} of a domestic cat. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List because it is widespread and abundant over most of its range.|$|R
50|$|The kodkod was {{formerly}} considered {{a member of}} the genus Oncifelis, which consisted of three small feline species native to South America. All of these species have been moved into the genus Leopardus. Along with the kodkod, the former members of Oncifelis were the colocolo and <b>Geoffroy's</b> <b>cat.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} season for <b>Geoffroy's</b> <b>cats</b> lasts from October to March. During this time, the female comes into estrus for periods {{of up to}} twelve days, between three and five weeks apart. Mating during this time is brief and frequent, often taking place on a high ledge or similar site.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Geoffroy's</b> <b>cat</b> inhabits the Andes, Pampas (scrubby forest parts), and Gran Chaco {{landscape}} {{from southern}} Bolivia to the Straits of Magellan at elevations ranging from sea level up to 3300 m. It prefers open woodland or scrubland {{with plenty of}} cover. It also occurs in grasslands and marshy areas.|$|R
50|$|Genetic {{studies have}} shown that <b>Geoffroy's</b> <b>cat</b> is most closely related to the kodkod.

50|$|In 2003, the {{dominant}} mode of inheritance of melanism in jaguars {{was confirmed by}} performing phenotype-transmission analysis in a 116-individual captive pedigree. Melanistic animals were found to carry at least one copy of a mutant MC1R sequence allele, bearing a 15-base pair inframe deletion. Ten unrelated melanistic jaguars were either homozygous or heterozygous for this allele. A 24-base pair deletion causes the incompletely dominant allele for melanism in the jaguarundi. Sequencing of the agouti signalling peptide in the agouti gene coding region revealed a 2-base pair deletion in black domestic cats. These variants were absent in melanistic individuals of <b>Geoffroy’s</b> <b>cat,</b> oncilla, pampas cat and Asian golden cat, suggesting that melanism arose independently {{at least four times}} in the cat family.|$|R

50|$|The {{culpeo fox}} is an {{opportunistic}} predator {{that will take}} any variety of prey. This fox mainly feeds on rodents and lagomorphs (especially the introduced European rabbit and European hare); however, it occasionally feeds on domestic livestock and young guanacos. Culpeos are considered beneficial because they are significant predators of the rabbits introduced in 1915; such introduced rabbit populations {{are believed to have}} allowed culpeos to spread from the Andean foothills across the Patagonian plain. They sometimes take young lambs up to a week old. In limited studies, the larger culpeo appears to dominate potential competitors, including South American gray foxes, <b>Geoffroy's</b> <b>cats,</b> Pampas cats, grisons and various raptorial birds. Its range also overlaps that of the much larger puma, but the size difference ensures that the two species have limited competition.|$|R
40|$|To avoid certain {{problems}} encountered with more-traditional and invasive {{methods in}} behavioral-ecology studies of mammalian predators, such as felids, molecular approaches have been employed to identify feces {{found in the}} field. However, this method requires a complete molecular biology laboratory, and usually also requires very fresh fecal samples to avoid DNA degradation. Both conditions are normally absent in the field. To address these difficulties, identification based on morphological characters (length, color, banding, scales and medullar patterns) of hairs found in feces could be employed as an alternative. In this study we constructed a morphological identification key for guard hairs of eight Neotropical felids (jaguar, oncilla, <b>Geoffroy's</b> <b>cat,</b> margay, ocelot, Pampas cat, puma and jaguarundi) and compared its efficiency {{to that of a}} molecular identification method, using the ATP 6 region as a marker. For this molecular approach, we simulated some field conditions by postponing sample-conservation procedures. A blind test of the identification key obtained a nearly 70 % overall success rate, which we considered equivalent to or better than the results of some molecular methods (probably due to DNA degradation) found in other studies. The jaguar, puma and jaguarundi could be unequivocally discriminated from any other Neotropical felid. On a scale ranging from inadequate to excellent, the key proved poor only for the margay, with only 30 % of its hairs successfully identified using this key; and have intermediate success rates for the remaining species, the oncilla, <b>Geoffroy's</b> <b>cat,</b> ocelot and Pampas cat, were intermediate. Complementary information about the known distributions of felid populations may be necessary to substantially improve the results obtained with the key. Our own molecular results were even better, since all blind-tested samples were correctly identified. Part of these identifications were made from samples kept in suboptimal conditions, with some samples remaining outdoors for up to seven days, simulating conditions in the field. It appears that both methods can be used, depending on the available laboratory facilities and on the expected results...|$|R
40|$|SummaryHybridization among {{animal species}} has {{recently}} become more {{recognized as an}} important phenomenon, especially {{in the context of}} recent radiations [1 – 9]. Here we show that complex hybridization has led to contrasting patterns of genomic composition among closely related species of the Neotropical cat genus Leopardus. We show strong evidence of ancient hybridization and introgression between the pampas cat (L.  colocolo) and northeastern populations of tigrina (L.  tigrinus), leading to remarkable cytonuclear discordance in the latter. In contrast, southern tigrina populations show recent and continuing hybridization with <b>Geoffroy’s</b> <b>cat</b> (L.  geoffroyi), leading to extreme levels of interspecific admixture at their contact zone. Finally, we demonstrate that two seemingly continuous Brazilian tigrina populations show no evidence of ongoing gene flow between them, leading us to support their formal recognition as distinct species, namely L.  tigrinus in the northeast and L.  guttulus in the south...|$|R

50|$|As {{traditionally}} defined, the colocolo {{occurs in}} the widest range of habitats of any small South American felid. This, combined with distinct differences in pelage colour/pattern and cranial measurements, {{was the basis for}} splitting the Pantanal cat and Pampas cat from the colocolo. Based on genetic divergence, the splits within the colocolo group are estimated to have occurred about 1.7 million years ago (Mya). This divergence was lower than that found within <b>Geoffroy's</b> <b>cat</b> (about 2 Mya) or the oncilla (about 3.7 Mya; this very high divergence -far higher than other species in the genus- has resulted in some suggesting more than one species is involved in the oncilla). Furthermore, the distribution pattern within the colocolo group based on genetics did not completely match that based on pelage colour/pattern and cranial measurements, and supported some of the traditional subspecific division rather than species division. While the population in northern Chile has been placed in L. colocolo based on cranial measurements, genetics associate it with Pampas cats from Bolivia, and while the population in western Argentina has been placed in the Pampas cat based on pelage colour/pattern and cranial measurements, genetics associate it with the colocolo. More recent genetic analysis also supports maintaining the Pantanal and Pampas cats as subspecies of the colocolo.|$|R
40|$|Wild felids and canids {{are usually}} the main predators in the food chains where they dwell and are almost {{invisible}} to behavior and ecology researchers. Due to their grooming behavior, they tend to swallow shed hair, which {{shows up in the}} feces. DNA found in hair shafts can be used in molecular studies that can unravel, for instance, genetic variability, reproductive mode and family structure, and in some species, it is even possible to estimate migration and dispersion rates in given populations. First, however, DNA must be extracted from hair. We extracted successfully and dependably hair shaft DNA from eight wild Brazilian felids, ocelot, margay, oncilla, <b>Geoffroy's</b> <b>cat,</b> pampas cat, jaguarundi, puma, and jaguar, as well as the domestic cat and from three wild Brazilian canids, maned wolf, crab-eating fox, and hoary fox, as well as the domestic dog. Hair samples came mostly from feces collected at the Sao Paulo Zoo and were also gathered from non-sedated pet or from recently dead wild animals and were also collected from museum specimens. Fractions of hair samples were stained before DNA extraction, while most samples were not. Our extraction protocol is based on a feather DNA extraction technique, based in the phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol general method, with proteinase K as digestive enzyme.

40|$|The <b>Geoffroy's</b> <b>cat</b> Leopardus geoffroyi (d'Orbigny & Gervais, 1844) {{is a small}} cat {{found in}} the Southern Cone of South America and, {{depending}} on the author, four or five subspecies have been usually recognized (L. g. geoffroyi, L. g. paraguae, L. g. euxanthus, L. g. salinarum and L. g. leucobaptus), mainly based on external morphological characters, such as color pattern of the pelage. In order to clarify the taxonomy of L. geoffroyi, I analyzed approximately 200 specimens housed in museums. I have examined the external and craniodental morphology in quantitative and qualitative terms {{in the search for}} patterns of congruent characters that would indicate the existence of taxonomic units. Twenty craniodental measurements were taken and tested by univariate and multivariate (MANOVA, PCA and DFA) procedures. In this study I detected a great variation in the morphological characters, and thus {{it was not possible to}} determine whether any of these were geographically consistent and could be used to determine any taxonomic unit. Based on this, I do not recognize any subspecific division for L. geoffroyi. Along its geographic range, a gradual and subtle change from one color pattern to the next along the latitude was detected, but the morphological characters that were used to define the putative subspecies were also detected in a same population. Furthermore, the present study is congruent with the results obtained by previous molecular data, suggesting that L. geoffroyi has a high level of genetic diversity with no geographic structure. This indicates the existence of a large panmictic population with no significant barriers to gene flow and, as a consequence, no subspecies should be recognized...|$|R
