5|$|Late in the season, reports {{began to}} surface that the Canucks would be {{purchasing}} their own AHL team and relocating it. Vancouver {{wanted to have}} more control over personnel decisions for their farm team and bought the Peoria Rivermen.

Calgary indicated {{they would be willing}} to move their franchise, but a deal between the Canucks and the city of Abbotsford was unable to be reached.

Eventually, the Canucks decided to relocate their <b>franchise</b> <b>to</b> Utica, New York, creating the Comets.|$|E

Top Rank's offer was rejected by the league due to questions surrounding their financing plan.

On June 21, 1994, the league officially denied sale of the <b>franchise</b> <b>to</b> Top Rank resulting in the Timberwolves remaining in Minneapolis.
