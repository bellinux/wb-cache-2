50|$|Additionally, {{most studies}} {{investigating}} gratitude journals {{have found that}} including 3-10 items in each gratitude journal entry yields the most beneficial results. While the majority of research has participants only write 3 things in their journal per entry, some {{studies have found that}} even writing 10 <b>items</b> per <b>entry</b> yields positive results for the author. However, researchers suggest that writing too many <b>items</b> per <b>entry</b> (above 10) will actually not yield the typical psychological benefits of a gratitude journal. With a higher number of items to record, the task of writing in a gratitude journal can become too tedious for individuals to comply with. Psychologist Robert A. Emmons believes that humans adapt to positive changes quickly, and that too many and too frequent gratitude journal entries will not have the same beneficial effects as shorter, less frequent entries. Including more than 10 items may even take away the salience of recognizing what there is to be grateful for in daily life.|$|R

Swapping clothes further promotes the use of sustainable online shopping and the internet as well as an increase of social bonds through online communication or effective personal communication in [...] "clothing swap parties".
