5|$|In {{addition}} to relatively long-wavelength radiation, Jupiter also emits synchrotron radiation (also {{known as the}} Jovian decimetric radiation or DIM radiation) with frequencies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of 0.1–15GHz (wavelength from 3m to 2cm), which is the bremsstrahlung radiation of the relativistic electrons trapped in the inner radiation belts of the planet. The energy of the electrons {{that contribute to the}} DIM emissions is from 0.1 to 100MeV, while the leading contribution comes from the electrons with energy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> 1–20MeV. This radiation is well understood and was used {{since the beginning of the}} 1960s to study the structure of the planet's magnetic field and radiation belts. The particles in the radiation belts originate in the outer magnetosphere and are adiabatically accelerated, when they are transported to the inner magnetosphere.|$|E

5|$|Low-energy {{electron}} diffraction (LEED) is {{a method}} of bombarding a crystalline material with a collimated beam of electrons and then observing the resulting diffraction patterns to determine {{the structure of the}} material. The required energy of the electrons is typically <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> 20–200eV. The reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique uses the reflection of a beam of electrons fired at various low angles to characterize the surface of crystalline materials.

5|$|On May21, the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) {{issued its}} forecast, {{predicting}} a season with below-normal activity.

UKMO's ACE index prediction was 74 units, with a 70% chance of the index falling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of 40 to 108 units. On May27, NOAA released its seasonal forecast, predicting a below-normal season with 6 to 11 named storms, 3 to 6 hurricanes, and 0 to 2 major hurricanes. NOAA indicated that there was a 70% chance of a below-normal season, a 20% chance of a near-normal season, and a 10% chance of an above-normal season.|$|E

5|$|The {{length of}} the pitch, or field, for {{international}} adult matches is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of 100–110m (110–120yd) and the width is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of 64–75m (70–80yd). Fields for non-international matches may be 90–120m (100–130yd) length and 45–90m (50–100yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105m (344ft) long and 68m (223ft) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches; however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.|$|E

5|$|The {{probability}} {{of the creation}} of strangelets decreases at higher energies. As the LHC operates at higher energies than the RHIC or the heavy ion programs of the 1980s and 1990s, the LHC is less likely to produce strangelets than its predecessors. Furthermore, models indicate that strangelets are only stable or long-lived at low temperatures. Strangelets are bound at low energies (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of 1–10MeV), while the collisions in the LHC release energies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of 7–14TeV. Thermodynamics very strongly disfavors the formation of a cold condensate that is an order of magnitude cooler than the surrounding medium. As an example, it is about as likely as producing an icecube in a furnace.|$|E
