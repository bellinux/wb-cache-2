40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to conduct an {{investment}} appraisal for milk-cooling, water-heating, and milk-harvesting technologies on a range of farm sizes in 2 different electricity-pricing environments. This was achieved by using a model for electricity consumption on dairy farms. The model simulated the effect of 6 technology investment scenarios on the electricity consumption and electricity costs of the 3 largest electricity-consuming systems within the dairy farm (i. e., milk-cooling, water-heating, and milking machine systems). The technology investment scenarios were direct expansion milk-cooling, <b>ice</b> <b>bank</b> milk-cooling, milk precooling, solar water-heating, and variable speed drive vacuum pump-milking systems. A dairy farm profitability calculator was combined with the electricity consumption model to assess the effect of each investment scenario on the total discounted net income over a 10 -yr period subsequent to the investment taking place. Included in the calculation were the initial investments, which were depreciated to zero over the 10 -yr period. The return on additional investment for 5 investment scenarios compared with a base scenario was computed as the investment appraisal metric. The results of this study showed that the highest return on investment figures were realized by using a direct expansion milk-cooling system with precooling of milk to 15 °C with water before milk entry to the storage tank, heating water with an electrical water-heating system, and using standard vacuum pump control on the milking system.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to provide insight into the {{variations}} in dairy farm electricity costs across five electricity tariffs. The effect of four milk cooling scenarios is also simulated to illustrate the effect of technologies on the electricity consumption, related costs and CO 2 emissions of a dairy farm. Helping dairy farmers to make informed business decisions when confronted with future options in the sphere of electricity tariffs and energy efficient cooling systems will contribute to optimum farm profitability and will help to improve the profitability and sustainability of the industry. A previously developed model capable of simulating electricity consumption, related costs and CO 2 emissions of dairy farms was used to simulate five electricity tariffs (Flat, Day&Night, Time of Use Tariff 1 (TOU 1), TOU 2 and Real Time Pricing (RTP)) on a dairy farm with 195 milking cows. The Flat tariff consisted on one electricity price for all time periods, the Day&Night tariff consisted of two electricity prices, a high rate from 09 : 00 to 00 : 00 h and a low rate thereafter. The TOU tariff structure was similar to that of the Day&Night tariff except that a third peak price band was introduced between 17 : 00 and 19 : 00 h. The RTP tariff varied dynamically according to the electricity demand on the national grid. The model used in these simulations is a mechanistic mathematical representation of the electricity consumption that simulates farm equipment under the following headings; milk cooling system, water heating system, milking machine system, lighting systems, water pump systems and the winter housing facilities. Direct expansion, <b>ice</b> <b>bank</b> and pre-cooling milk cooling systems were simulated to determine how dairy farm electricity consumption, related costs and CO 2 emissions vary according to the milk cooling system installed on the farm. Annual simulated electricity consumption of the farm was 32, 670 kWh when a direct expansion milk cooling system without pre-cooling of milk was included in the model. The annual electricity consumption of the farm on the day & night tariff was € 4, 571. Adding precooling with ground water to the direct expansion milk cooling system reduced annual electricity consumption by 28 % to 23, 660 kWh and reduced annual electricity costs by 38 % to € 2, 875. The addition of a pre-cooling system to the direct expansion milk cooling system saved 3, 973 kg of CO 2. Simulation of an <b>ice</b> <b>bank</b> milk cooling system without pre-cooling resulted in annual simulated electricity consumption of 34, 777 kWh.

The equipment cycles radically creating high peak demands and low load factors. An <b>ice</b> <b>bank</b> thermal energy storage (TES) and ice water vapor condenser were installed. The existing equipment and TES system were computer monitored to determine energy consumption and potential for load shifting. Using thermal energy storage results in a load shift of 174. 5 kw. With TES, total energy consumption and operating costs are reduced by $ 13, 400 per season. This is a result of low off-peak energy rates and increased compressor efficiency at night. The <b>ice</b> <b>bank</b> thermal energy storage system has a 4. 4 year simple payback. While building ice, the refrigeration system operated at a 6. 26 Coefficient of Performance (COP). The refrigeration system operated more efficiently at night because the compressors ran fully loaded, had a higher average suction temperature, a lower average discharge pressure, and benefitted from increased subcooling. The average on-peak COP was 4. 36. On-peak head pressures as high as 204. 2 psig were observed. The night-time ice building theoretical average COP is 6. 9, only 9. 5 % better than the on-peak period. However, because the compressors don't idle during the off-peak period, the actual on-peak COP is 24 % better then the off-peak period.

40|$|Glacier surge is {{a catastrophic}} glacier advance which can 2 ̆ 7 t be {{explained}} by variation in climate. We propose a "hydro-thermal instability" model which is capable of explaining surges of an inversion type glacier. An inversion type glacier has a cold ice zone in its lower part which is mainly frozen to the bed rock and a temperate snow zone in its higher part into which meltwater percolates in summer. This glacier is in a potentially unstable condition, since the movement of ice and water is dammed by the lower cold <b>ice</b> <b>bank.</b> If this bank is fractured by thrust faults, dammed water drains through the faults and warms the bank temperature to the melting point. Then a catastrophic advance (the surge) will occur. Here we determined the climate condition in which such an inversion type glacier can exist, i. e., the freezing index during winter is more than 2000 (℃ day) and annual precipitation exceeds 700 (mm water) at the snow line of a glacier. Many surging glaciers fit the climatic condition for the inversion type. The ice sheets of Greenland and Laurentide {{are estimated to be}} in similar unstable condition.

The application of these procedures to hazards related to CCS and EOR infrastructures poses many problems strictly related to the peculiar thermodynamic behaviour of the CO 2 (Koorneef et al, 2009). Difficulties in the prediction of the discharge behaviour of the CO 2 during rapid depressurizations can influence calculations concerning the atmospheric dispersion and the eventuality of a dry <b>ice</b> <b>bank</b> formation (Mocellin et al., 2015).

The application of the model shows good agreement with the experimental data series, especially in terms of pressure profiles and discharge time. In addition, the vessel thermal dynamics is adequately predicted both for the releases at higher pressure investigated especially when related to an internal surface temperature experimentally derived...|$|E
40|$|Ice based Cool Thermal Energy Storage (CTES) {{systems have}} {{attracted}} much attention during last few decades. The reasons are mainly of economical and environmental nature. Compared to conventional refrigeration and air-conditioning systems without cool thermal energy storage, implementation of CTES will increase environmental standards and overall efficiency of the energy systems as it contributes to the phase-out of synthetic refrigerants and reduces peak loads in electricity grids. For {{the application of a}} cool thermal energy storages in refrigeration installations and HVAC systems in industry and building sector, it is necessary to have appropriate design tools in order to sufficiently accurate predict their performance. In this thesis theoretical and experimental investigations of two ice based cool thermal energy storage systems, namely static, indirect, external melt, ice-on-coil, i. e. <b>ice</b> <b>bank</b> system and dynamic, ice slurry cool thermal energy storage system are carried out. An <b>ice</b> <b>bank</b> storage technology for cooling purposes is known for a long time. The main drawbacks which are hindering its wider use are the system complexity, high first costs, system efficiency which is highly dependant on design, control and monitoring of the system, etc. On the other hand, ice slurry technology was not well studied until recently, while in the current scientific literature there are still differences between results and conclusions reported by different investigators. The aim of the present thesis is to extend the knowledge in the field of ice based CTES systems, thereby contributing in the development and wider utilization of those systems. In {{the first part of the}} thesis a computer application, named “BankaLeda” is presented. It enables simulation of an <b>ice</b> <b>bank</b> system performance. In order to verify developed simulation model an experimental evaluation has been performed. Field measurements have been conducted on a two module silo which was installed as a part of the refrigeration system in dairy and cheese factory “Antun Bohnec” in the city of Ludbreg in Croatia. Experimental findings were compared to the simulation model. The software „BankaLeda“ presents a strong optimization tool for designers and engineers in the field by providing a high degree of freedom in defining particular system design and operating parameters. It offers a basis for assessment and testing of a new energy efficient system arrangements and measures. Besides it will give decisionmakers the ability to test potential solutions in the process of CTES system design. In the second part of the thesis ice slurry pressure drop and heat transfer in horizontal straight tubes have been experimentally investigated. In particular a mixture of 10. 3 % of ethanol and water with an initial freezing point of - 4. 4 °C was considered. It was found that the behaviour of ice slurry flow is changing with time and that ice slurry pressure drop is generally higher than for single phase flow. However for ice concentrations of 15 % and higher, for certain velocities ice slurry pressure drop is found to be of a similar value as for single phase fluid. Moreover, if ice slurry is to be used as a energy transport media it is recommended to keep the ice mass fraction at a level of 20 %. With tube geometry and thermophysical properties of a carrier fluid the heat transfer of ice slurry is generally a function of ice mass fraction and velocity. The imposed heat flux has no or has just minor influence on the heat transfer coefficient. Up to ice mass fraction between 10 - 15 % the mean heat transfer coefficient shows only slight (laminar flow) or no increase (turbulent flow) in comparison to single phase flow. Beyond that ice mass fraction the heat transfer coefficient is increasing significantly. The test data for pressure drop and heat transfer in laminar and turbulent regime was compared to several correlations from the literature. A new correlations for ice slurry pressure drop and heat transfer in the laminar flow regime, for 10. 3 % ethanol and water mixture, were derived based on the present experimental data. The correlation for pressure drop predicts 82 % of the experimental data with ± 15 % accuracy, while the correlation for heat transfer predicts 75 % of the data with the same accuracy. In order to investigate advantages and disadvantages of a dynamic, ice slurry system over a static, indirect, external melt, ice-on-coil CTES system and to assess their differences from economical aspects, a theoretical simulation model of an ice slurry CTES have been developed. It was found that the ice slurry based CTES systems posses higher economic and energy saving potential than static type systems. In the best case scenario the total energy consumption of dynamic CTES system was found to be approximately 25 % lower than for a static CTES system. QC 2010071...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to assess how, and to what extent do {{managerial}} and technology changes affect electricity consumption, associated costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of dairy farms. The impact of future electricity price tariffs on dairy farm energy costs was quantified and the efficacy of adjusting milking time to mitigate peak electricity prices was explored. A dairy farm electricity and economic model was applied to assess the potency of technology investment strategies to improve farm profitability and deliver a return on capital invested. The results of this study showed that the most efficacious technology investment strategy to increase farm profitability consisted of a direct expansion milk cooling system with pre-cooling of milk to 15 °C with well-water prior to entry to the milk storage tank and heating water with an electrical water heating system. An individual farmer can also choose to minimise electricity use, related costs and GHG emissions, with the trade-off of reduced profitability by adding a solar thermal water heating system.
