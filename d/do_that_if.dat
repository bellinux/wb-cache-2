5|$|Vorenus and Pullo set off {{in search}} of the eagle, encountering and rescuing Octavian from his captors. Octavian thanks them and {{promises}} that they will be rewarded. Vorenus and Pullo discover Pompey's slave with the eagle hiding in the bandit cart and kill him, realizing the bandits were hired by Pompey. A politically astute Octavian explains that their mission is only a gesture, since the theft of the eagle is actually a blessing in disguise to Caesar. Civil war between Caesar and Pompey is inevitable, but Caesar needs Pompey to make the first move so as not to appear the aggressor; Pompey is likely to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he believes Caesar's soldiers {{are on the verge of}} desertion. The trio returns in triumph to camp, where a surprised yet grateful Caesar takes the eagle back and more than adequate proof of Pompey's hostility. He sends Pompey the head of his slave and informs him of his next move, to winter the 13th Legion at Ravenna on the Italian border, in preparation for pressing his rights to the Consulship. Pompey breaks all ties with Caesar and takes Cornelia as his wife. Octavia, humiliated at being used by Pompey and heartbroken over her pointless divorce, says she wants him dead.|$|E

25|$|Following a brief move to Salt Lake City, Utah, Underwood {{returned}} to Los Angeles, where she found {{work as a}} waitress at the Pig ‘n Whistle restaurant in downtown Los Angeles. One day in April 1920, she was lamenting to Harry Underwood, a co-worker, that her Hollywood relative had resurfaced and demanded that Underwood live with her again and relinquish her paychecks to her, or she would turn the underage girl over to the authorities. Harry {{told her that the}} relative could not <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he and Underwood were married. The couple married three weeks later on April 28, 1920.|$|E

25|$|Much of what I {{did with}} my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a {{different}} body—there's {{not as much}} of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do {{have to think about}} it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra Whhoomf! Now it doesn't <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> <b>If</b> I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.|$|E
500|$|Frusciante {{became friends}} with former Dead Kennedys drummer D. H. Peligro in early 1988. They often jammed together, and Peligro invited his friend Flea (bassist of Red Hot Chili Peppers) to join. Frusciante and Flea {{developed}} a musical chemistry immediately, with Flea later acknowledging {{that might have been}} the day he first played the bass riff to [...] "Nobody Weird Like Me". Around the same time, Frusciante intended to audition for Frank Zappa's band, but changed his mind before the final try-out as Zappa strictly prohibited illegal drug use. Frusciante said, [...] "I realized that I wanted to be a rock star, do drugs and get girls, and that I wouldn't be able to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I was in Zappa's band." ...|$|E
500|$|Vickers, {{who would}} leave Hendrick Motorsports in 2007 for Red Bull Racing Team, said: [...] "I would {{expect them to}} be a little upset. Jimmie is my friend, my teammate, and he is running for a championship. But he knows just as well as I <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I wasn't bump-drafting, he never would have had a shot to pass Junior." [...] Additionally, he denied that he drove more aggressively because he was leaving. Third-place {{finisher}} Kurt Busch argued Vickers was in a [...] "Catch-22" [...] situation: [...] "He was trying to help his teammate. It just didn't turn out that way. Vickers was doing the best he could to help the 48. He just didn't anticipate the 8 car blocking as long as he did." [...] Vickers would later receive additional security during the next race weekend.|$|E

2500|$|In criticizing Newt Gingrich for {{secretly}} {{having an}} affair with a staffer while Gingrich, as House Speaker, was simultaneously impeaching President Bill Clinton for lying under oath about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, DeLay said, [...] "I don't think that Newt could set a high moral standard, a high moral tone, during that moment.... You can’t <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you're keeping secrets about your own adulterous affairs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Take {{the case}} of an Irishman who strikes an Italian [...] working on the railroad. A body of [...] Irish say, We do not like ‘Dagos’ and will not work with them, and they drive them off; they wouldn’t <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they were Irish.

2500|$|When asked a {{week later}} about the {{controversy}} about Obama's pastor that prompted, and was addressed by, Obama's speech, Clinton answered, [...] "He {{would not have been}} my pastor. You don't choose your family, but you choose what church you want to attend... hate speech [...] unacceptable in any setting... I just think you have to speak out against that. You certainly have to <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> not explicitly, then implicitly by getting up and moving." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a July 2010 {{interview}} with Metal Injection, Glenn Danzig {{was asked if}} he was going to make another Danzig record after Deth Red Sabaoth. His response was, [...] "I don't know, we'll see. With the way record sales are now...I won't do some stupid pro-tool record in someone's living room where all the drum beats are stolen from somebody and just mashed together...and I'm not going to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I can't do a record how I want to do it, and if it's not financially feasible, I'm just not going to do one." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Cowboy Jack Clement, {{who took}} over {{production}} duties from Sam Phillips, [...] "There's two heads; one records, and one plays back. The sound comes along and it's recorded on this head, and a split second later, {{it goes to the}} playback head. But you can take that and loop it to where it plays a split second after it was recorded and it flips right back into the record head. Or, you can have a separate machine and <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> <b>if</b> you do it on one machine, you have to echo everything." [...] In more technical terms a tape delay and a 7-ips, instead of the more advanced 15-ips. The recordings were thus an idealized representation of the customary live sound.|$|E
2500|$|In 1982, Blair was {{selected}} as the Labour Party candidate for the safe Conservative seat of Beaconsfield, where there was a forthcoming by-election. Although Blair lost the Beaconsfield by-election and Labour's share of the vote fell by 10 percentage points, he acquired a profile within the party. In contrast to his later centrism, Blair made it clear in a letter he wrote to Labour leader Michael Foot in July 1982 (published in [...] 2006) that he had [...] "come to Socialism through Marxism" [...] and considered himself on the left. Like Tony Benn, Blair believed that [...] "Labour right" [...] was bankrupt: [...] "Socialism ultimately must appeal to the better minds of the people. You cannot <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you are tainted overmuch with a pragmatic period in power." [...] Yet, he saw the hard left as no better, saying: ...|$|E

2500|$|In an October 15, 2008 {{interview}} with Us Weekly, Richard gave further insight into O'Day's dismissal from Danity Kane. [...] " [...] {{did not like}} [...] image...where her image was going for the group," [...] she said. [...] "It wasn't a personal thing." [...] Richard explained that O'Day's increasingly [...] "sexy look" [...] was alienating young fans. Referring specifically to O'Day's topless pictures for Complex magazine just a month before, Richard stated, [...] "We had just did a signing with Dollhouse Teen, which is for 13, 14-year-old young girls... So we can't do that one day {{and then the next}} day do an obnoxious cover.... wants the fans, and he says he can't <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we can continue to go in the direction that we were going." [...] Richard further relayed, [...] " [...] told me specifically that [...] is no longer in Danity Kane and Danity Kane will move forward without her." [...] When asked if Combs would seek [...] "replacements" [...] for O'Day and Woods, Richard stated, [...] "He has not said anything per that. But I think in my heart that he is gonna do another show." ...|$|E
