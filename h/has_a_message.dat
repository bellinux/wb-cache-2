2500|$|In April 1991, some {{elements}} of the [...] "LP Version" [...] were further reworked into a commercially minded single release.

[...] and [...] "3 a.m. Eternal" [...] during the peak of the band's mainstream popularity. [...] This version reached #2 in the UK Singles Chart, and found top ten chart success internationally. [...] The track preserves the chord progression and string break of previous versions, placed {{in the context of a}} relentless, sample-filled rave arrangement. [...] Unlike the prior Stadium House offerings, Ricardo Da Force's rap was removed, except for [...] "This is what The KLF is about, also known as The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, furthermore known as The JAMs...", but the trilogy is consolidated by the presence of distinctive samples from both [...] "What Time Is Love?" [...] and [...] "3 a.m. Eternal". [...] As with much of The KLF's output, the track is jubilant and highly self-referential, purporting that it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> to deliver yet proceeding with deliberate ambiguity. [...] Also typical of The KLF, it refers to The Illuminatus! Trilogy novels and the Lost Continent of Mu. [...] The song features on The KLF's video The Stadium House Trilogy.|$|E

2500|$|Explaining {{the concept}} of the film, Lopez stated: [...] "There's twists and turns and it's {{exciting}} [...] but it also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>message,</b> which is what attracted me to it in the first place, which is an empowering thing." [...] Describing its message, she said [...] " [...] you're in these negative situations, negative relationships, whatever, you can get out [...] The power to get out of those things is always within yourself. That's the message of the movie." [...] When Lopez read the script, she knew she was [...] "going to have to do [...] whole sequence at the end" [...] which featured an act that required her to [...] "become a believable lean, mean fighting machine." [...] Lopez then thought she should learn T'ai Chi or Tae Kwon Do, but was worried about learning it at an expert level {{in a short period of}} time. Her personal trainer then suggested that she study Krav Maga, the [...] "official self-defense system of the Israeli Defense Forces which has recently become trendy in the States. The fighting style focuses on combating realistic scenarios with moves that are based on common, instinctual reactions", according to MTV News. Talking about the system, Lopez said: [...] " [...] levels out the playing field between men and women [...] Where it doesn't matter how big or tall or strong you are. You can actually maneuver around that. It's about getting out of the way, counter attacking and using whatever you can to get the upper hand." ...|$|E
