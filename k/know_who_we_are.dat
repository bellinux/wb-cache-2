500|$|Eveanescence cover artwork was {{introduced}} on the band's website on August 30, 2011. It is their first album cover {{which does not}} feature Lee. In an interview, she discussed the cover: [...] "Well, both of our other records are me on the cover, and I think it's cool to have that photo, you know, that people can look at and go, 'OK, that's who that is.' But I feel like, by now, they <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> and I wanted something really different. I didn't feel like {{we had to put}} a photo on the cover, I wanted it to be more mysterious and more about Evanescence itself, not just me." [...] The cover, black with vapor behind the band's name, is a play on the meaning of [...] "evanescence" [...] ("to dissipate like vapor").|$|E
500|$|Finally, Duerr {{once again}} criticises the {{approach}} of Western society and its anthropologists to studying [...] "archaic" [...] spiritual beliefs. He asserts that in these [...] "archaic" [...] cultures, people [...] "have a much clearer idea {{about the fact that}} we can not be only what we are if at the same time, we are also what we are not, and that we can only <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> if we experience our boundaries". He denounces Western scientists and anthropologists for their approaches to the study of such cultures, arguing that they have misrepresented them by attempting to fit them within the Western ideas of objectivity. He argues that in future, anthropologists must reach their own boundaries, and recognize the wilderness of their consciousness before they can truly understand the worldview of [...] "archaic" [...] humans.|$|E

50|$|We got {{offered to}} work with Kara right as she was {{becoming}} an American Idol judge. <b>We</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> she <b>was.</b> She didn't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were.</b> <b>We</b> got hooked up with her. I'm like, 'Who is this person?' She's like, 'Who's this annoying band?' But {{we got in the}} room, and it was like magic, and we wrote the song in 15 minutes. It's, like, the best song on our album.|$|R
500|$|Harring {{described}} her interpretation {{after seeing the}} film: [...] "When I saw it the first time, I {{thought it was the}} story of Hollywood dreams, illusion and obsession. It touches on the idea that nothing is quite as it seems, especially the idea of being a Hollywood movie star. The second and third times I saw it, I thought it dealt with identity. Do we <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are?</b> And then I kept seeing different things in it... There's no right or wrong to what someone takes away from it or what they think the film is really about. It's a movie that makes you continuously ponder, makes you ask questions. I've heard over and over, 'This is a movie that I'll see again' or 'This is a movie you've got to see again.' It intrigues you. You want to get it, but I don't think it's a movie to be gotten. It's achieved its goal if it makes you ask questions." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2016, leaked texted {{messages}} between Letizia and businessman Javier Lopez Madrid {{created a}} controversy. Together with other executives {{and board members}} of the Caja Madrid and Bankia financial group, Madrid {{had been accused of}} corruption.

To hell with the rest. Kisses yoga mate (miss you!!!)". Felipe also joined in, texting [...] "We do indeed!" [...] Publication of the texts by the newspaper El Diario threatened to undo the line Felipe had drawn between himself and the scandal of Infanta Cristina and her husband, as well as questions over the origins of ex-King Juan Carlos's private fortune. A palace official subsequently stated that the King and Queen were no longer friends with Madrid due to his legal issues.|$|E
2500|$|By daybreak {{the twins}} were {{approaching}} the sacred mountain called [...] [...] They saw smoke rising from the ground, {{and saw that it}} came from an underground chamber with a ladder extending.

Whether the Christian owners of that house {{did or did not}} <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> I am not certain. At any rate, through them <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{introduced}} at night into the palace of Politian, the Melchite Patriarch of Alexandria. He was a stern-faced, black-bearded man of honest heart but narrow views, of whom the Bishop Barnabas had often spoken to me as his closest friend.

What I am afraid of is that he will lower a boat and row Miss Greendale and her maid ashore. He might do it either there, or, what would be much more likely, row ashore to some quiet place during the night, take his friend and two or three of his men with him, and leave the rest to sail her to Port au Prince." ...|$|R

60|$|In {{the early}} part of the afternoon, we drew near the place to which the party were going. It was a solitary house {{inhabited}} by four or five old women, <b>who,</b> when <b>we</b> entered, <b>were</b> gathered in a circle about the mats, eating poee from a cracked calabash. They seemed delighted at seeing our companions, but rather drew up when introduced to ourselves. Eyeing us distrustfully, they whispered to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were.</b> The answers they received were not satisfactory; for they treated us with marked coolness and reserve, and seemed desirous of breaking off our acquaintance with the girls. Unwilling, therefore, to stay where our company <b>was</b> disagreeable, <b>we</b> resolved to depart without even eating a meal.|$|R
2500|$|Following Carver's {{death the}} {{following}} year, William Bradford was made governor.

5000|$|As {{was also}} {{the case for the}} Specials, Chrysalis, 2-Tone's parent company, were hoping to give the band some success in the United States, organising a coast-to-coast tour, {{preceding}} with a re-release of [...] "On My Radio". However, audiences were mostly unaware of the band; and Black later stated [...] "There were small groups of people on the west and east coast <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> but there was this huge big bit in the middle the US who were completely gob-smacked by us". The tour [...] "did little to expand the [...] popularity in the US and they were to suffer the same fait as The Specials, with their material confined to the college radio circuit." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Hook Me Up" [...] {{was written}} by The Veronicas' twin sisters, Jessica and Lisa Origliasso {{together}} with Shelly Peiken and Greg Wells – Wells also produced the track. The composition {{was influenced by the}} electropop of underground bands in Los Angeles, whose sound The Veronicas were keen to incorporate into their own music. Jessica explained the lyrical content and central theme behind [...] "Hook Me Up": [...] "It's about being tired with where you're at in life and wanting to get away and out for {{just a little bit of}} time-whether it's in a relationship or in life. I guess we went through that a little bit when things started getting full on with us.

60|$|With this {{resolution}} {{we went on}} cheerfully, when, within about twelve days' sail more, we made the island Formosa, at a great distance, but were ourselves shot beyond the southernmost part of the island, being to leeward, and almost upon the coast of China. Here <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{a little at a}} loss, for the English factories were not far off, and <b>we</b> might <b>be</b> obliged to fight some of their ships, if we met with them; which, though <b>we</b> <b>were</b> able enough to do, yet we did not desire it on many accounts, and particularly because we did not think it was our business to have it <b>known</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> or that such a kind of people as <b>we</b> had <b>been</b> seen on the coast.

500|$|The period {{following}} Enema of the State saw {{the band}} experience great transition. [...] "We {{had gone from}} playing small clubs and sleeping on people's floors to headlining amphitheaters and staying in five-star hotels," [...] recalled Hoppus in 2013. [...] "After years of hard work, promotion, and nonstop touring, people <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> and listened to what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> saying... it scared {{the shit out of}} us." [...] The band was rushed into recording the follow-up, as according to DeLonge, [...] "the president of MCA was penalizing us an obscene amount of money because our record wasn't going to be out in time for them to make their quarterly revenue statements. [...] And <b>we</b> <b>were</b> saying, 'Hey, <b>we</b> can't do this right now, we need to reorganize ourselves and really think about {{what we want to do}} and write the best record we can.' They didn't agree with us." ...|$|R
5000|$|ISM activist Richard Purssell testified, [...] "they began {{demolishing}} one house. We {{gathered around}} {{and called out}} to them {{and went into the}} house, so they backed out. During the entire time they <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> and what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing, because they didn't shoot at us. We stood in their way and shouted. There were about eight of us in an area about 70 square meters. Suddenly, we saw they turned to a house they had started to demolish before, and I saw Rachel {{standing in the way of}} the front bulldozer." [...] Human-rights activists and Palestinians say that the demolitions had also been accompanied by gunﬁre from Israeli snipers. The director of Rafah's hospital, Dr. Ali Moussa said that 240 Palestinians, including 78 children, had been killed.

60|$|I would fain have learnt {{what the}} {{occasion}} of all this was, but I could not understand one word they said, though by signs I perceived {{that some of them}} knew not what was the occasion themselves. I was so terrified in my thoughts at this outrageous attempt, that I could not stay there, but went back to my own men: I told them my resolution, and commanded them to follow me, when in the very moment came four of our men, with the boatswain at their head, running over the heaps of bodies they had killed, all covered with blood and dust, as if they wanted more people to massacre, when our men hallooed to them as loud as they could halloo, and with much ado one of them made them hear, so that they <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> and came up to us.|$|R
40|$|<b>Knowing</b> <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> {{and where}} <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> are two {{fundamental}} {{aspects of our}} physical and mental experience. Although the domains of spatial and social cognition are often studied independently, a few recent areas of scholarship have explored the interactions of place and self. This fits in with increasing evidence for embodied theories of cognition, where mental processes are grounded in action and perception. <b>Who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> might be integrated with where <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> and impact how we move through space. Individuals vary in personality, navigational strategies, and numerous cognitive and social competencies. Here we review the relation between social and spatial spheres of existence in the realms of philosophical considerations, neural and psychological representations, and evolutionary context, and how we might use the built environment to suit <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> or how it creates <b>who</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> In particular <b>we</b> investigate how two spatial reference frames, egocentric and allocentric, might transcend into the social realm. We then speculate on how environments may interact with spatial cognition. Finally, we suggest how a framework encompassing spatial and social cognition might be taken in consideration by architects and urban planners...|$|R
