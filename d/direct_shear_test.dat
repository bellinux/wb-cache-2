40|$|This paper {{describes}} large-size <b>direct</b> <b>shear</b> <b>tests</b> on soil-geotextile interfaces. Medium-grained, uniform {{sand and}} three varieties of woven and nonwoven geotextiles manufactured with different techniques are utilized {{to investigate the}} soil-geotextile interface friction coefficient (f{*}). Tests were carried out using an apparatus specifically designed for interface testing, and results were compared with those obtained from the conventional <b>direct</b> <b>shear</b> equipment. The results obtained from this study indicated that the determination of peak interface behaviour was not a trivial matter, as the results were significantly affected by the boundary and testing conditions of the testing apparatus. The residual interface behaviour was investigated by multiple reversal <b>direct</b> <b>shear</b> <b>tests.</b> Since {{the use of multiple}} reversal <b>direct</b> <b>shear</b> <b>tests</b> on the proposed apparatus can impose a high degree of shear displacement and stress uniformity on the soil-geotextile interface, a more reliable definition of the residual interface friction can be obtained. The results indicate that woven-nonwoven geotextile interfaces exhibit a significant postpeak strength loss after a number of shear cycles. In the case of woven geotextiles, this is attributed to the opening up of the filaments associated with the physical damage caused during shear, whereas for nonwoven geotextiles it is due to the pulling out or tearing of filaments...|$|R

40|$|Shear {{strength}} of soil {{is characterized by}} cohesion, {{angle of internal friction}} and dilatation. The first two parameters mentioned primarily define the soil's ability to resist shear stress underspecified load. These parameters can be determined by tests conducted either in the laboratory or the field for use in design of geotechnical structures. Some of the tests in the laboratory to determine the shear {{strength of}} soil, include triaxial, ring shear, torsional shear, direct shear and direct simple shear. <b>Direct</b> <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> is the most widely used geotechnical shear device due to its simplicity, however, the test suffers from stress inhomogeneity. Direct simple shear apparatus was developed because of the shortcomings in the <b>direct</b> <b>shear</b> <b>test.</b> In these two tests, different shearing conditions are applied to soil samples. For the <b>direct</b> <b>shear</b> <b>test,</b> shearing occurs at a predetermined center of the specimen which may not be the weakest plane of the soil while indirect simple shear, the entire specimen distorts without the formation of single shearing surface. The mode of shearing established in the direct simple shear device is similar to that which occurs around the shaft of a pile. In contrast to the extensive geotechnical application of <b>direct</b> <b>shear</b> <b>test,</b> limited information exists on direct simple shear test. This thesis endeavours to establish {{the relationship between the two}} tests by undertaking extensive testing to obtain a better understanding of direct simple shear test as used for testing local soils and to determine a correlation with the results from direct shear tests. A series of shear tests were undertaken on Klipheuwel sand, Kaolin clay and composite of the sand and clay using universal shear device. The soils were mixed with water in percentages of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 %, and the composite with clay percentages of 10, 25, 50 and 75 %, to investigate the impact of water and clay on the shear parameters determined from the two tests. The results showed that <b>direct</b> <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> gives higher shear strength when compared to direct simple shear test under the same soil condition. The addition of water, and clay, generally reduced the internal friction angle of sand for both tests. Furthermore, increase in cohesion was observed with the addition of water to Kaolin clay for the direct simple shear test and the reverse was true in the <b>direct</b> <b>shear</b> <b>test.</b> The correlation factors developed in this study for the direct simple shear test could be used to refine the results from the <b>direct</b> <b>shear</b> <b>test...</b>|$|E

Owing to the large size of tyre shreds commonly used in practice, large-scale <b>direct</b> <b>shear</b> <b>testing</b> equipment is specially fabricated to obtain the shear strength parameters of mixtures. The effect of tyre shred-tosand mixing ratio on the mechanical response of the mixtures is studied by performing <b>direct</b> <b>shear</b> <b>tests</b> on mixtures prepared at different mixing ratios.

The size of the mortar specimens is 40 mm× 40 mm× 40  mm (length × width × height) for compression and 40 mm× 40 mm× 160 mm (length × width × height) for tension. The reason why we measured the macroscopic tensile strength by uniaxial tensile test is that uniaxial tensile strength is more reliable than other tensile strengths (Haeri et al. 2016; Sarfarazi and Schubert Sarfarazi and Schubert). With regard to the <b>direct</b> <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> of mortar specimens, the traditional rectangular short-beam <b>direct</b> <b>shear</b> <b>test</b> is adopted.
