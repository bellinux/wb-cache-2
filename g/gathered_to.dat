5|$|In 2009, {{primatologist}} James Thorn used environmental niche modelling in Indonesia {{to supplement}} the poor population data <b>gathered</b> <b>to</b> date to predict the remaining available habitat for slow lorises on the islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. These estimates indicated that the Javan slow loris was the most threatened by habitat loss, followed by the Sunda slow loris from Sumatra. The Bornean slow loris was in a better situation since much of its range consists of low-risk areas. Both the Bengal slow loris and pygmy slow loris are found in more than 20protected areas, although their populations are either low or insufficiently recorded.|$|E
