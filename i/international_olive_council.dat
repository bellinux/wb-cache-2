30|$|Chemical and {{physical}} features (i.e., acidity or polyphenols) are traditionally relevant in differentiating olive oils {{with respect to}} taste and nutritional properties. These features basically stem from the plant variety, the cultivation and harvesting techniques, {{as well as from}} the processing technology (De Gennaro et al. 2009). In particular, the acidity content remains the most relevant element for vertical differentiation in the olive oil market. According to this aspect, olive oils are classified as extra-virgin, virgin, and fine <b>olive</b> oils (IOOC: <b>International</b> <b>Olive</b> Oil <b>Council</b> 2016).|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Very little {{information}} {{is available on the}} characteristics of the Lebanese olive germplasm. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the fruit and oil characteristics of the main Lebanese olive varieties (Aayrouni, Abou chawkeh, Baladi, Del and Soury) from two successive crop seasons (2010 - 2011). RESULTS: All of the genotypes had medium-high oil content in the fruit, indicating their suitability for oil production; Aayrouni had particularly high values. The variety Abou chawkeh also had a high pulp/pit ratio, which is a very desirable trait in table olives. For all the varieties the values of free fatty acids, peroxide values, absorbances in ultraviolet, fatty acid composition, sterol content and composition and erythrodiol+uvaol content of the oils were within the requirements of the <b>International</b> <b>Olive</b> <b>Council's</b> Trade Standard for extra virgin olive oil. The only exception was for the values of Δ- 7 -stigmastenol in 2011 in Soury and, especially, in Baladi, which were higher than 0. 5 %. In some cases, stearic and arachidic acids fluctuated around the maximum values allowed. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study provide a first picture of the main characteristics of olives and oils currently produced in Lebanon...|$|R

50|$|Test {{results are}} {{measured}} against the <b>International</b> <b>Olive</b> <b>Council</b> trade standard to identify abnormalities. Each test provides key information which allows {{a decision to}} be made {{with respect to the}} grade of Olive oil and the identity of any adulterants. However, the <b>International</b> <b>Olive</b> <b>Council</b> does not test for deodorisation which makes up the bulk of fake extra-virgin oils. Soft column deodorisation is the process where steam is forced through a tank of inferior oil which removes all taste, colour and nutrients, colouring is then added before the tank is topped up with real extra-virgin oil to add flavour.|$|E

Olive oil is the principalproduct; more than 70 % of the olive productionis intended to trituration. In this region most ofthe olive orchards were established andcultivated by traditional methods, and olive oilextraction is generally carried out by artisanalmethods which can compromise its quality. Classical methods of analysis were used for apreliminary characterisation of olive oilproduced by regional cooperatives (Lakrarma,Kenine localised in Taourirt-Tafoughalt corridor).

30|$|Europe {{produces}} {{about two}} thirds of the worldwide olive oil production with a high share of the remaining volumes coming from the other countries of the Mediterranean basin (IOOC: <b>International</b> <b>Olive</b> Oil <b>Council</b> 2016). Italy follows Spain, the first world producer in terms of volumes, with an average 20 % of the total European olive oil production. About {{two thirds of}} total Italian production is represented by extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). In many traditionally producing countries, the cultivation of olive trees is widespread almost {{all over the country and}} involves the majority of the farms. Olive mills are often small and technologically simple processing units with a local basin of olive suppliers and clients. However, also larger and more technological processing plants, both private and cooperative, are active in the market and supply different demand segments.|$|R
30|$|Extra-virgin {{olive oil}} (EVO) is an {{important}} element in the Mediterranean diet and a major agricultural crop for Southern European countries in terms of both farm income and cultivated area (De Graaff and Eppink 1999; Owen et al. 2000; Pupo D’Andrea, 2007; Marchini et al. 2010). Moreover, given the increased popularity of the Mediterranean diet among consumers in the US, Canada, Australia and large parts of Asia, EVO consumption has grown almost worldwide (Santosa and Guinard 2011; <b>International</b> <b>Olive</b> Oil <b>Council</b> 2012). Contextually, olive-oil production has switched from low yields and low-input cultivation to a capital-intensive farming system involving innovations in both agricultural practices and processing techniques. This has led to a considerable improvement in EVO nutritional characteristics accompanied by a profound change in sensory profile, turning a traditional food, with well known organoleptic features, into a brand new kind of dressing.|$|R

The Panel testing method by the <b>International</b> <b>Olive</b> Oil <b>Council</b> was initially considered by the EEC as a good instrument for ensuring an improved quality in virgin olive oils. Panel testing is discussed as a method useful for obtaining information that chemical and physical methods cannot give, and as a legal test. After some years of experience, we know the weakness of the C. O. I, method and it is also possible to discuss its legal and economic consequences.

40|$|Tiger nut oil {{is a novel}} {{oil that}} {{requires}} more research data on its characteristics. In this study, the oil was extracted using both enzyme-aided pressing (EAP) and aqueous enzymatic extraction (AEE) methods. Using enzymes as a pre-treatment prior to mechanical pressing increased the concentration of some phenolic acids and tocopherols present in extracted oils compared to controls. High pressure processing as a pre-treatment before aqueous enzymatic extraction also enhanced tocopherols and total polyphenolic content in oils. The percentage free fatty acid and peroxide values indicated that under the initial extraction parameters, the oils were stable and they all met the standards for virgin olive oil set by the <b>International</b> <b>Olive</b> Oil <b>Council.</b> Residual meals from both extraction processes contained low protein contents ranging from 2. 4 to 4. 6 %. Additionally, EAP and AEE meals contained low DP (degree of polymerisation) sugars that appeared as 1 -kestose (DP 3) and nystose (DP 4). EAP had the highest total DP 3 and DP 4 sugar content of 82. 5 mg/g. These sugars would need further assessment to verify their identity and determine their suitability as a potential food...|$|R
30|$|The {{fatty acid}} profile was {{determined}} as fatty acid esters by gas chromatography. The sample methyl esters were prepared {{using the method}} used by the IOOC (<b>International</b> <b>Olive</b> Oil <b>Council</b> 2001). Standards of the methyl esters of the fatty acids were lauric (C 12), myristic (C 14), palmitic (C 16), stearic (C 18 : 0), oleic (C 18 : 1), linoleic (C 18 : 2), linolenic (C 18 : 3), arachidic (C 20 : 0), arachidonic (C 20 : 4), behenic (C 22 : 0), eurcic (C 22 : 1) and lignoceric (C 24 : 0). Standard mixtures of these esters were injected in the Gas Chromatography (DANI GC 1000) for identification and quantification purposes. Standards and samples (3 drops dissolved in 3  ml of chloroform) were injected (0.5  ml) to the GC. The column and mobile phase were ECT- 5 and 5 % phenyl and 95 % methylpolysiloxane, respectively. The flow rate and pressure used were ml per minute and 1.25 Bar, respectively. The GC oven was kept at 50 °C for 2  min, heated at 4 °C/min up to 250 °C, where it was kept for 15  min. The detector was a flame ionization detector (FID), and the carrier gas was nitrogen (5  ml/min) (Alcantara et al. 2000).|$|R

The samples which were studied collected from the North of Morocco are specific to the region of Ouazzane in Loukkos were examined for physical and chemical properties (acidity, pH, peroxide values, saponification number, iodine value, ultraviolet spectrophotometric analysis (k 232 and k 270), refractive index), fatty acids composition and total phenol content. Olive oil was analyzed for fatty acids commonly present in olive oils which are palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, and arachidic. Oliec acid was found in high percentage ranged from (64. 80 to 72. 80), followed by palmitic, Linoleic, palmitoleic, stearic and linolenic. Arachidic acid was detected in all olive oil samples but in low percentage. Total phenol contents expressed as gallic acid of olive oils values ranged from (112 to 313 mg/kg). All olive oil samples were compared with <b>International</b> <b>Olive</b> Oil <b>Council</b> (IOOC), were not exceed the limits and exhibited remarkable physicochemical properties and could be useful as edible oils and industrial applications.

40|$|Olive oil flavour {{represents}} {{the most important}} factor that influences customer’s perception for quality. In this study, an innovative aromatisation approach that enhanced quality and shelf life of olive oil is tested by means of in situ ultrasound-assisted extraction of Carum carvi L. seeds in olive oil. After the flavouring process, carvone and limonene, representing 99 % of caraway essential oil, were identified in virgin olive oil as revealed by headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatograph coupled to mass spectrometer (HS-SPME gas chromatograph (GC) /mass spectrometer (MS)) analyses. Furthermore, kinetic studies indicate that flavouring rate in ultrasound-assisted system is faster than conventional aromatisation producing very stable aromatised oil with no changes in quality. This fact is attributed to ultrasound contribution to mass transfer intensification of essential oil components from seeds to the bulk medium, confirmed by scanning electron micrograph (SEM) micrographs in which cell damage and exudation of its main content are illustrated. However, {{it is important to note}} that ultrasound-treated samples produce higher degrees of conjugated dienes and conjugated trienes compared to conventional maceration. Nevertheless, this increase is not alarming and remains within permitted values of the European Community and the <b>International</b> <b>Olive</b> Oil <b>Council</b> (IOOC). Ultrasoundflavouring system stands as a fast alternative aromatisation method, which allows on top shelf life enhancement and olive oil quality preservation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An expert’s panel {{according}} to the official method of <b>International</b> <b>Olive</b> Oil <b>Council</b> analyzed the organoleptic profile of the oils produced during one single harvesting season from 57 cultivars of the Tuscan germoplasm. The oils were grouped in three different clusters depending {{on the presence of}} different organoleptic features. The identified clus-ters of the extra virgin olive oils were compared for maturity index of the fruits and for the phenols content and acidic pro-file. Since phenols content and acidic profile depend on the genetic matrix hence the cultivar played a fundamental role on the overall quality. The majority of the varieties produced oils with the attributes requested by the local Protected Origin while others induced sensations, at the moment, not considered in the disciplinary of production like tomato or herbs. The presence of peculiar organoleptic attributes like tomato, sweet pepper, camomile or others is not common within the olive oils and they are present only to few varieties. The list of possible positive descriptors for the extra virgin olive oils could be enlarged or better specified including the terms of melon and chestnut flour. We proposed also the olfactory sensation of mushroom as reminiscent of the typical and pleasant odour of fresh cut mushroom as a possible new negative attribute of the extra virgin olive oil induced by the presence of antrachnose (Colletotrichum gloesporioides; Glomerella cingulata) on the olive fruits...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to carry out {{physicochemical}} analysis and to evaluate the fatty acid composition of imported olive cultivators. Oils were extracted from cultivars Leccino and Coratina which are being cultivated in two districts of Balochistan province. Physicochemical properties of the oils were boiling point, 286 - 290 °C; melting point, - 5. 3 to - 6. 8 °C; refractive index (25 °C), 1. 63 - 1. 98; iodine value, 64 - 72 / 100 [*]g of oil; acid value, 0. 27 - 0. 89 [*]mg of KOH/g of oil; saponification number mg KOH/g of oil, 186. 4 - 198. 7; and specific gravity, 0. 89 - 0. 93 respectively. Fatty acids which are commonly present in olive oils were analyzed using Gas Chromatograph. The results obtained showed the presence of varied quantities of fatty acids (stearic, arachidic, linoleic, oleic, linolenic, palmitics, palmitoleic). A high percentage of oleic acid (61. 56 - 67. 43 %) was found, followed by palmitic acid (13. 60 - 17. 61 %), linoleic acid (12. 23 - 14. 45 %), and stearic acid (1. 40 - 2. 68 %) respectively in cultivars from both districts. Physicochemical quality and fatty acid composition of the extracted oils were in conformity with <b>International</b> <b>Olive</b> Oil <b>Council</b> (IOOC).

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{applicability}} of an iterative approach aimed at defining a chemical blueprint of virgin olive oil volatiles to be correlated to the product sensory quality. The investigation strategy proposed allows to fully exploit the informative content of a comprehensive multidimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) coupled to a mass spectrometry (MS) data set. Olive oil samples (19), including 5 reference standards, obtained from the <b>International</b> <b>Olive</b> Oil <b>Council,</b> and commercial samples, were submitted to a sensory evaluation by a Panel test, before being analyzed in two laboratories using different instrumentation, column set, and software elaboration packages in view of a cross-validation of the entire methodology. A first classification of samples based on untargeted peak features information, was obtained on raw data from two different column combinations (apolar × polar and polar × apolar) by applying unsupervised multivariate analysis (i. e., principal component analysis—PCA). However, to improve effectiveness and specificity of this classification, peak features were reliably identified (261 compounds), {{on the basis of}} the MS spectrum and linear retention index matching, and subjected to successive pair-wise comparisons based on 2 D patterns, which revealed peculiar distribution of chemicals correlated with samples sensory classification. The most informative compounds were thus identified and collected in a “blueprint” of specific defects (or combination of defects) successively adopted to discriminate Extra Virgin from defected oils (i. e., lampante oil) with the aid of a supervised approach, i. e., partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). In this last step, the principles of sensomics, which assigns higher information potential to analytes with lower odor threshold proved to be successful, and a much more powerful discrimination of samples was obtained in view of a sensory quality assessment...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutical Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} study was to extract olive oil from the fruit of Olea europaea by means of supercritical carbon dioxide (sc-C 02) as an alternative to traditional methods. Extractions were performed on a laboratory scale supercritical fluid extractor of the latest design, featuring three mutually independent flow systems and extremely high flow rates. A number of extraction runs based on a statistical design was performed to establish the conditions (time, pressure, temperature) for a maximum yield of extracted olive oil. These conditions turned out to be 50 OC and 460 atm (corresponding density of 0. 953 g/mL) for a 60 minute extraction run. The influence of different variables on the yield of extracted oil was investigated by means of computer-assisted surface response analysis. Additional extraction runs were performed at selected conditions to make reliable conclusions regarding the temperature, pressure and density dependencies of the extraction process and the nature of the mechanism of extraction. The density of the extracting fluid was found to be the key variable which limits the extraction by the extent to which olive oil dissolves in sc-CO 2. The composition of the sc-C 02 derived oil was determined by GC-GCTTOF-MS analysis and compared to that of commercial olive oil. A total of 27 peaks were detected in the chromatogram of the sc-C 02 derived oil as opposed to 37 peaks observed for commercial olive oil. These peaks could all be identified, and the two major components in the sc-C 02 derived olive oil are hexadecanoic and oleic acid. The quality and composition of the oil were evaluated against standard specifications of the <b>International</b> <b>Olive</b> Oil <b>Council</b> and classified on the basis of these criteria as lampante olive oil.

40|$|Fruit {{tree growth}} habit and vigour are {{important}} traits for orchard management and production, yet {{are difficult to}} select for in breeding programs because the parameters for their evaluation are complex, and their expression often requires sufficient plant size and development, entailing valuable time. Thus, in olive (Olea europaea L.) breeding, as for other fruit crops, {{it is critical to}} define growth habit and vigour parameters with selection potential, and to determine the earliest age at which they can be measured. Furthermore seedling growth habit traits are important in themselves, particularly in their relation to juvenile period length and management. To explore these issues we evaluated a series of new and standard growth habit parameters {{during the first year of}} growth in a population of unpruned olive seedlings originating from six different crosses. The influence of plant age on growth habit traits was determined by comparing measurements at two or three different times. Both parent genotype and plant age significantly affected the vigour and growth habit of the olive seedlings, and 9 months was the most appropriate age for evaluating seedling growth parameters. 'Picual', 'Arbosana' and 'Sikitita' were shown to be promising cultivars for use as genitors, because of their tendency to produce offspring with desirable growth habit traits such as high vigour, weeping habit and low lateral shoot number. From among the 17 parameters studied, based on parent influence and the absence of correlation among parameters, five were identified which best described olive seedling growth habit: Primary Shoot Top Diameter, Primary Shoot Conicity, Secondary Shoot Number, Secondary Shoot Insertion Angle and Longest Secondary Shoot Internode Length. © 2011 Elsevier B.
