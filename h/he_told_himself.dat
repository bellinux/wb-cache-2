500|$|Barbree's {{most recent}} book, [...] "Live from Cape Canaveral: Covering the Space Race, from Sputnik to Today", was {{released}} on August 28, 2007, {{to coincide with the}} 50th anniversary of spaceflight, that began with the Sputnik 1 launch on October 4, 1957. The foreword is written by Tom Brokaw. Barbree's book attempts to illustrate how the media has changed in their coverage of the space programs, from the early enthusiasm to the relative disinterest in the program today. Barbree says he wrote the book because as he looked back over his career, when recalling all the people he'd worked with, very few were left. Barbree claims that <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself,</b> [...] "You're {{the only one who has}} covered the whole program going all the way back to the beginning, and if you don't tell the story, who is going to do it?" [...] It received generally poor reviews from space historians.|$|E
500|$|Neil Milbert {{wrote that}} Secretariat [...] "ran {{what may have}} been the {{greatest}} horse race in history." [...] When asked about Secretariat's margin of victory, trainer Lucien Laurin stated: [...] "Naturally, not that big!" [...] He further commented on Sham's performance saying [...] "The horse we had to kill, we did." [...] My Gallant's jockey Angel Cordero, Jr. said Secretariat was [...] "just like a car." [...] Secretariat's jockey Ron Turcotte told the press that he saw the timer on the track hit 2:20 and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> [...] "Oh I can make it" [...] and continued to press Secretariat forward to break the course record. The UPI wrote that Secretariat's performance in the race put him in the ranks of the greatest race horses of all-time. Following the race, Secretariat was allowed several weeks rest before entering a few more competitions and then starting his a career as a stud, where he had been syndicated for close to $6.08 million. The 40th anniversary of the win was commemorated by the New York Racing Association in 2013 by placing a blue-and-white checkered pole at the Belmont track 253 feet, 2 inches from the finish line to mark the 31-length margin of victory.|$|E
500|$|According to Stevens, {{in one of}} {{his first}} games as head coach, he was nervous and [...] "felt like our team played on edge" [...] because of it. He decided that a team's play will reflect the mood of its coach; a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in {{difficult}} game situations, while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge. [...] "I don’t want to lose a game because of my approach," [...] <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself.</b> Accordingly, he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games. He rarely raises his voice or gets emotional, instead quietly observing on the sideline with folded arms. He does not get upset about bad calls by referees or player mistakes, preferring to focus on [...] "the next play" [...] rather than what just happened. Butler player Willie Veasley explained Butler's 2010 Final Four run by saying, [...] "When those big runs [...] came, Coach called a timeout and said a few calm words. Then he said he believes in us, he loves us and we're going to win the game." [...] On the rare occasion Stevens feels the need to correct a player, he does it with [...] "positive reinforcement, just at a little louder decibel", according to former assistant coach Matthew Graves. Above all, Stevens wants his players to be confident, not living in fear of being yanked for making a bad play.|$|E
60|$|Then Lord Arranmore <b>told</b> {{her what}} <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> Brooks <b>himself.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No; <b>he</b> <b>told</b> me, <b>himself,</b> that <b>he</b> {{would have}} taken flight at once and, in that case, his kingdom would have been lost; and he himself, sooner or later, hunted down." ...|$|R
60|$|Without a word Harry turned away. <b>He</b> had <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> {{there was}} no hope; but he knew by the bitter pang he felt {{now that he had}} hoped to the last. Then he walked slowly away to tell the news.|$|R
2500|$|Pius {{demanded that}} Marcus take up {{residence}} in the House of Tiberius, the imperial palace on the Palatine. Pius also made him take up the habits of his new station, the aulicum fastigium or [...] "pomp of the court", against Marcus' objections. Marcus would struggle to reconcile {{the life of the}} court with his philosophic yearnings. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> it was an attainable goal—"where life is possible, then it is possible to live the right life; life is possible in a palace, so it is possible to live the right life in a palace"—but he found it difficult nonetheless. He would criticize himself in the Meditations for [...] "abusing court life" [...] in front of company.|$|E
60|$|He was, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself,</b> {{going to}} leave Seattle that evening.|$|E
60|$|He was accursed <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself.</b> He {{must die}} alone, {{as he had}} lived.|$|E
6000|$|Ja-don {{looked at}} her for a long minute. [...] "Ko-tan would make you his queen," [...] he said. [...] "That <b>he</b> <b>told</b> me <b>himself</b> and surely that were honorable {{treatment}} from one who might make you a slave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, I {{did tell}} Joe, sir," [...] he answered, with a reproachful glance at that amateur. [...] "I met Cap’in Flower that evening again, late, an’ <b>he</b> <b>told</b> me <b>himself.</b> I’m {{sorry to see}} by this morning’s paper that his ship is overdue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Maitland replied, [...] "about his {{ancient history}} I own I don't know anything. As to the row with the Frenchman at Cairo, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> me <b>himself.</b> <b>He</b> said the beggar {{was too small}} for him to lick, and that duelling was ridiculous." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{heard the}} {{trampling}} {{and his eyes}} snapped open. Never sleep on a strange planet, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> futilely.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bannister chuckled inwardly. It {{seemed to}} him that victory was in sight. He always won, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself,</b> always.|$|E
60|$|Murmuring faces {{waited and}} watched; murmurous voices filled the dark {{shell of the}} cave. He feared {{intensely}} in spirit and in flesh but, raising his head bravely, he strode into the room firmly. A doorway, a room, the same room, same window. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> calmly that those words had absolutely no sense which had seemed to rise murmurously from the dark. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> that it was simply his room with the door open.|$|E
60|$|He {{hung up the}} {{receiver}} and {{walked out into the}} hall. He was angry with himself because only an hour ago <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> that <b>he</b> would not make that call. He was angry, too, because the fact of his making it or not making it had assumed a ridiculous importance in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Mortimer {{had been}} bending forward solicitously. He overbalanced and nearly fell off his chair. The shock had been stunning. Even {{before he had}} met and spoken to her, <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> that <b>he</b> loved this girl with the stored-up love of a lifetime. And she was Mary Somerset! The hotel lobby danced before Mortimer's eyes.|$|R
60|$|After a pause Hirst {{remarked that}} the worst infamy had still to be <b>told.</b> <b>He</b> {{addressed}} <b>himself</b> to Helen.|$|R
60|$|Hardy hesitated. Diplomacy, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself,</b> was one thing; lying another. He {{passed the}} {{question}} on to the rather badly used Mr. Wilks.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{they fell}} off here maybe Tom fell off, too!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself.</b> And then he {{commenced}} {{to search the}} vicinity carefully.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll have to {{be careful}} in the future," [...] <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself,</b> with clenched fists. [...] "But I'll get square--oh, I'll get square!" ...|$|E
5000|$|A New York Times profile {{said that}} [...] "his life story reads {{more like the}} script of an Errol Flynn adventure", though the stories <b>he</b> <b>told</b> about <b>himself</b> were often dubious. He was once {{described}} as [...] "a feisty little man who always had a cigarette dangling from his lips and {{looked more like a}} bartender than a choreographer." ...|$|R
60|$|Our hero's friends were, I think, {{almost more}} elated by our hero's {{promotion}} than was our hero <b>himself.</b> <b>He</b> never <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> {{that it was}} a great thing to be a junior lord of the Treasury, though he acknowledged to himself that to have made a successful beginning was a very great thing. But his friends were loud in their congratulations,--or condolements as the case might be.|$|R
500|$|A [...] New York Times profile {{said that}} [...] "his life story reads {{more like the}} script of an Errol Flynn adventure", though the stories <b>he</b> <b>told</b> about <b>himself</b> were often dubious. He was once {{described}} as [...] "a feisty little man who always had a cigarette dangling from his lips and {{looked more like a}} bartender than a choreographer." ...|$|R
60|$|His eyebrows {{were drawn}} together. This was his work, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself,</b> this {{magnificent}} physical subjection. Yet {{his inability to}} stir her sometimes maddened him.|$|E
60|$|She {{was angry}} about that fool of a girl, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself.</b> A good sign. But what an actress! His conceit barely kept him up.|$|E
60|$|At this point, he {{had tried}} to rally. Such running away, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself,</b> was futile. He would stand still and fight the fever in him.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{the fear}} of this that had kept Sir Felix away from the club. Grasslough, as <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>himself,</b> was just the fellow to ask such a {{question}},--ill-natured, insolent, and obtrusive. But the question demanded an answer of some kind. 'Yes,' said he; 'a fellow attacked me in the street, coming behind me when I had a girl with me. He didn't get much {{the best of it}} though.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{as there}} may be {{marriage}} without love, so {{there may be}} love without marriage. You cannot but feel how little you know of me, and ignorant as you are of so much, that to marry me might be--ruin.' It was just what <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> over and over again, {{when he had been}} trying to resolve what he would do in regard to her. 'Don't you know that?' ...|$|R
60|$|And {{he thought}} of the boy's danger. He had rashly promised that the boy should be sent to England out of harm's way; but <b>he</b> now <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> that the means of doing so were further from him than ever; and that he was daily {{becoming}} a poorer, if not a ruined man. Of the rents then due to him, not a penny would, he feared, be paid.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll win {{even if she}} doesn't care," [...] <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself.</b> [...] "I'll not do it for her, or myself--I'll do it for {{the honor}} of Brill!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{must be the}} cottage," [...] <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself,</b> {{and walking}} to it he rapped on the door four times in {{succession}} and then four times again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've tramped {{far enough}} for one day, anyway," [...] <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>himself.</b> [...] "I'll just stop at the store for a few things, and then go {{straight}} home." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Mr. Barry {{came down}} to see him after Mountjoy had made his visit. It was now January, and the {{bargaining}} about the marriage had gone {{on for more than}} two months. The letter which he had received from the Squire of Tretton had moved him; but <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>himself</b> that the property was his own, and that he had a right to enjoy it as he liked best.|$|R
60|$|JAMES. <b>He's</b> <b>told</b> {{us about}} <b>himself,</b> and we're {{very sorry for}} him. I've promised {{to take him back}} here if he'll make a fresh start. [Looking {{steadily}} at RUTH] This is a matter that requires courage, ma'am.|$|R
6000|$|... "He told it me. That is why I esteemed him--for {{the calm}} fortitude {{with which he}} bore adversity. Since then, {{considering}} what he has done, I have almost come to doubt if what <b>he</b> <b>told</b> me of <b>himself</b> was true." ...|$|R
