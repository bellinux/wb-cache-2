50|$|The {{botanist}} J E Lousley {{visited the}} island {{one afternoon in}} May 1957 and recorded fifty-four species of plant, despite finding most of the island covered in a tangle of bracken and bramble to 1 m high and difficult to penetrate. Unusual plants (for the Isles of Scilly) in the brackish pool are sea-milkwort (Glaux maritima), <b>fennel-leaved</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Stuckenia pectinata) and red goosefoot (Chenopodium rubrum). A visit by John Hunt in the 1980s found a ″healthy″ growth of bracken. The fern soft shield-fern (Polystichum setiferum) {{once thought to be}} very rare on the islands has now been found on all the inhabited islands (except Bryher) and curiously also on Northwethel.|$|E
