40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation is to determine extrusion die shapes, which minimize distortion during axisymmetric and 3 D extrusion. An axisymmetric upper bound model with a flexible die shape is developed in a spherical coordinate system. The flexible streamlined die shape is described by a Legendre polynomial series, where the higher order coefficients are selected based upon optimization. Four criteria to minimize distortion {{are used in the}} upper bound model to determine optimal die shapes. Analysis of the optimal die shapes with FEM confirms two robust criteria: average <b>effective</b> <b>strain</b> and volumetric <b>effective</b> <b>strain</b> rate deviation. ^ When average <b>effective</b> <b>strain</b> is minimized with the axisymmetric upper bound model, die shapes are obtained which minimize the average <b>effective</b> <b>strain</b> in the extrudate, but do not minimize distortion. When volumetric <b>effective</b> <b>strain</b> rate deviation is minimized with the upper bound model, die shapes are obtained which minimize the deviation of the <b>effective</b> <b>strain</b> rate distribution in the deformation zone. Such a die is called a controlled strain rate die. The axisymmetric results show that minimizing the volumetric <b>effective</b> <b>strain</b> rate deviation produces controlled strain rate die shapes, which form product with minimum distortion. ^ The axisymmetric upper bound model in spherical coordinates is extended to the 3 D extrusion from round to square and round to rectangle and is used to obtain die shapes which produce minimum distortion in the extrudate by minimizing the volumetric <b>effective</b> <b>strain</b> rate deviation. The 3 D streamlined die shape is characterized by a Legendre polynomial series where the higher order coefficients are either constants or functions of the rotational coordinate, 2 ̆ 6 phiv;. FEM is used to compare the average distortion along the rectangle symmetry planes for two optimal die shapes. ^ When the optimal die shape is described by the Legendre coefficients as function of 2 ̆ 6 phiv;, the difference in the average distortion between the symmetry planes decreases. Such a die shape causes material in the deformation zone to speed up or slow down, creating a more uniform distortion distribution in the finished product. ...|$|E

40|$|ArticleThis is the author's {{accepted}} manuscript. The final published {{version of}} record {{is available at}} [URL] paper considers <b>effective</b> <b>strain</b> tensors {{within the context of}} linear elastic equilibrium theory. The elastic properties of structured materials are often averaged over subvolumes of various scales inside the material. For subvolumes smaller than a representative volume element, simple volume-averaging of the stress and strain may not preserve the elastic energy. We introduce an averaging process which preserves the energy for all boundary conditions. This averaging process emphasizes the parts of the material which carry the most stress. Here the <b>effective</b> <b>strain</b> is weighted by the local stress, and can be interpreted as an average strain over all paths taken by loads and forces through the volume. This alternative <b>effective</b> <b>strain</b> may be especially appropriate for materials with voids, such as foams and granular matter, as the averaging only involves the material itself. For uniform boundary conditions the weighted strain matches the volume-averaged strain. This paper investigates the properties of this weighted strain tensor. First, for each path taken by loads and forces through the volume we can measure a net length as well as a net extension due to the linear deformation. The weighted <b>effective</b> <b>strain</b> equals the ratio of average length to average extension, where the averaging is over all possible force paths. Thus this method provides a connection to load path analysis. Secondly, even when the average rotation within the subvolume is zero, there may be local fluctuations in the rotation field. These rotations can act like a mechanism, transferring elastic energy between boundaries or degrees of freedom. The <b>effective</b> <b>strain</b> defined here highlights this mechanism effect...|$|E

Physical build-and-test procedures used for designing forging dies are prohibitively expensive and result in long lead times in obtaining satisfactory designs. In the present study the wedge test was advanced to the level of a standard laboratory test in order to verify the analytical results of a viscoplastic finite-element program, ALPID (Analysis of Large Plastic Incremental Deformation), which was developed to simulate the metal flow in deformation processes such as forging and extrusion. Wedge-shaped specimens were machined from plates of 1100 -F and 6061 -T 6 aluminum alloy and the grids engraved on the meridian plane by means of a CNC engraver. The specimens were compressed in segmented dies at room temperature. The undeformed and deformed grids were digitized, and the true <b>effective</b> <b>strains</b> were calculated using a computer program developed for that purpose. The <b>effective</b> <b>strains</b> were then displayed as contour plots for comparison with the ALPID-generated strain values.

40|$|AbstractThe Johnson Cook (JC) {{material}} {{model is}} often used for modeling hypervelocity impacts (HVI) because {{it is capable of}} capturing high rate deformation and temperature effects. Within the JC model, material damage leading to fracture is aggregated using a path dependent damage parameter. Contributions to the damage parameter are calculated at each cycle as the quotient of incremental <b>effective</b> plastic <b>strain</b> over the <b>effective</b> failure <b>strain.</b> The <b>effective</b> failure <b>strain</b> {{is a function of the}} stress state, strain rate, and temperature which changes locally throughout the simulation. Solid bodies often demonstrate variability in resilience resulting from material inclusions and defects. Therefore, in addition to the deterministic, state-based variability in the <b>effective</b> failure <b>strain</b> inherent to the JC model, efforts are often made to capture the effect of general material non-uniformity. Although other approaches may be available, the Weibull probability distribution is often employed within failure analyses to allow simulations to diverge from a completely uniform solution. In this paper, we investigate several methods of augmenting the JC damage model with Weibull variability. The implementation of each method provides a means for measured material uncertainty to enter the calculation. We focus on a standard three-parameter Weibull probability density function (pdf) although the methods proposed can be used with any probability distribution. Characteristics of the pdf are preserved within a solid body at its initial state but differ in the effect the JC <b>effective</b> failure <b>strain</b> has on these characteristics as the material state changes. The Weibull pdf under various loading conditions is discussed, and simulation results incorporating these methods are compared with those employing only the JC damage model or Weibull variability...|$|R
