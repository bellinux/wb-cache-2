2500|$|... “The {{conductor}} {{went around}} and collected tickets {{and when he}} came to me <b>I</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> my ticket and he refused to take it. [...] It was one of the Omnibus railroad tickets, one that I had purchased of them previous to that time. [...] He replied that colored persons were not allowed to ride. [...] I told him I had been in the habit of riding ever since the cars had been running. [...] I answered that I had a great ways to go and I was later than I ought to be.” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> the typewritten {{communication}} which I had received.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> {{the dollar}} and went away, {{perfectly}} satisfied with my reputation.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Say, why mayn't <b>I</b> <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> one?' {{demanded the}} pistol-bearer pathetically. 'What's your kick against pushin' his face in?' ...|$|R
5000|$|The Gospel of Matthew {{specifies}} that Judas received thirty {{pieces of}} silver: Then {{one of the}} Twelve — the one called Judas Iscariot — went to the chief priests and asked, [...] "What {{are you willing to}} give me if <b>I</b> <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> over to you?" [...] So they counted out for him thirty silver coins. From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> over.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> was <b>handing</b> <b>him</b> the half-sovereign, when {{something}} came bobbing {{up against the}} window, and Mr. Bilder's face doubled its natural length with surprise.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> the letter, {{which he}} read {{with the most}} {{concentrated}} attention.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> the paper. He {{spread it}} out upon the {{engraving}} board before him.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> Wood on the Sources of the Oxus. Carnehan {{was deep}} in the Encyclopaedia.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jeeves," [...] I said, [...] "a V-shaped rumminess has {{manifested}} {{itself from the}} direction of Worcestershire. Read these," [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>handing</b> <b>him</b> the papers in the case.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{some time}} I hesitated {{how to change}} it. Then one day I came here to see my friend Giatron--we came {{together}} from Italy. <b>I</b> <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> the note. <b>I</b> ask him please change. He give me the change and I stay {{to have a drink}} with the head waiter, who is a friend of mine. Presently Giatron comes out. He calls me into the office. Then I begin to tremble. He looks at me and I tremble more.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here it is," [...] <b>I</b> exclaimed, <b>handing</b> <b>him</b> a three-cornered note, {{which had}} come in my mother's letter. He seized it eagerly and thrust it into the breast-pocket of his coat.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> the {{remaining}} one, {{and pretended to}} feel about {{in the bottom of}} the boat. In that moment I recovered myself.|$|E
60|$|I had {{to carry}} the boy out myself, he sunk into such a collapse. <b>I</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> over to the soldiers, and went back.|$|E
60|$|I would though, if I had had my senses! But all I {{thought of}} then {{was to get}} his face away, and <b>I</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> my money.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are welcome," [...] <b>I</b> answered, <b>handing</b> <b>him</b> {{a little}} gourd of snuff in token of hospitality. Then I waited while he poured {{some of the}} snuff into {{the palm of his}} hand and took it in the usual fashion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Willingly!" [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>handing</b> <b>him</b> the bouquet. Botany was, I knew, a {{favourite}} {{study of}} his: and these flowers were {{to me so}} entirely new and mysterious, that I was really curious {{to see what a}} botanist would say of them.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>handed</b> to <b>him</b> {{the sealed}} letter which Mr. Hawkins had {{entrusted}} to me. He {{opened it and}} read it gravely. Then, with a charming smile, {{he handed it to}} me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of pleasure.|$|R
60|$|ANTHONY. Very bad, {{and more}} frightened. <b>I</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> over to Few-ton. Mingle {{might just as}} well have called him in the first place, instead of bothering me.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Drive to the Back Home Restaurant on Third Avenue,' says I. 'And if I don't {{find what}} I want there, take in these saddle-shops.' <b>I</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> the list.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> the letter, and the memorandum. He {{read the}} first without {{appearing}} to be much interested in it. But the second--the memorandum--produced a strong impression on him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Silence, you crop-eared dog!" [...] he cried. [...] "Had I my {{way some}} of the {{insolence}} would be frozen out of you before morning." [...] Mastering his passion, he turned upon Sophie with what he {{meant to be a}} gallant manner. [...] "If you have a cellar with a good lock," [...] said he, [...] "the fellow may lie in it for the night, since you have done him the honour to take an interest in his comfort. I must have his parole that he will not attempt to play us any tricks, as I am answerable for <b>him</b> until <b>I</b> <b>hand</b> <b>him</b> over to the Hetman Platoff to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} rob you," [...] said I; {{and raising the}} cloak I took from the pockets a silver flask, a square wooden case and a field-glass. All these <b>I</b> <b>handed</b> to <b>him.</b> The wretch opened the case, took out a pistol, and pointed it {{straight}} at my head.|$|R
60|$|His little {{eyes looked}} sharply at me; {{but he made}} no reply, and, shaking <b>hands,</b> <b>I</b> left <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> {{back the}} valise {{and the empty}} paint-pot, dropped to my hands and knees--my camera slung about my neck--and {{proceeded}} to crawl into the bush. My friend stood watching me.|$|E
60|$|He was {{impervious}} to reason, I made him promise never {{to say a}} word to me about his disgusting fatness again whatever happened--never, and then <b>I</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> that little piece of skin.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> {{a copy of}} my {{election}} address, {{which he}} read carefully through, with a large cigar {{in the corner of}} his mouth. He handed it back to me with a somewhat depressed air.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I {{am not so}} sure of that, Mr. Robbie,’ I replied, as <b>I</b> shook <b>hands</b> with <b>him.</b> ‘But {{at least}} there shall be no time lost with me.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take it," [...] <b>I</b> said magnanimously, <b>handing</b> <b>him</b> the rifle, {{which he}} {{received}} {{in a very}} gingerly fashion. After all, I reflected, there is nothing much more useless than a rifle without ammunition.|$|R
60|$|I murmured my thanks, {{and very}} deep and sincere were they. Then, having kissed his <b>hand,</b> <b>I</b> left <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> {{the rudder}} {{and lay down}} under the canvas. At first I was too restless to sleep; but after awhile tired nature could stand it no longer, and I dropped into a heavy slumber.|$|E
6000|$|Here <b>I</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> my card. [...] "In this {{instance}} I am not prompted by curiosity, I {{act on the}} part of Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was, he understood, lately for sale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Twala, we {{give this}} magic tube to thee, and by-and-by I will show thee {{how to use}} it; but beware how thou turnest {{the magic of the}} Stars against a man of earth," [...] and <b>I</b> <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> the rifle.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Littimer {{was here}} today, to inquire for you,' <b>I</b> remarked, <b>'and</b> <b>I</b> {{understood}} <b>him</b> {{that you were}} at Oxford; though, now I think of it, he certainly did not say so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am not so}} sure of that, Mr. Robbie," [...] I replied, as <b>I</b> shook <b>hands</b> with <b>him.</b> [...] "But {{at least}} there shall be no time lost with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{until he}} grows up. He has neither father nor mother, {{and to whom}} could <b>I</b> <b>hand</b> <b>him,</b> now? Moreover if, as you say, our people intend to drive the English from Bombay, his fate would be certain. When I am by myself with him, I shall talk to him in English, {{as soon as he}} is old enough to {{understand}} that he must not speak in that language to others; then, when he joins his own people, {{he will be able to}} converse with them. In the ten years I have spent in English service I have come to speak their language well. Though I cannot teach him the knowledge of the English, I can do much to fit him to take his place as an Englishman, when the time comes." ...|$|R
