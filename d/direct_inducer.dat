Previous {{studies have shown that}} disruption of the UL 41 gene abrogates vhs activity, but have not determined whether the UL 41 polypeptide is the <b>direct</b> <b>inducer</b> of mRNA degradation or whether it is the only virion component required for this activity. In this paper we report that transfaction of cells with UL 41 inhibits expression of a cotransfected CAT reporter gene and that the inhibition is not dependent upon other viral genes. Inhibition of CAT expression was due to UL 41 -dependent reduction of CAT mRNA levels. UL 41 alleles encoding polypeptides that lacked vhs activity during virus infections exhibited a similar lack of activity in transfected cells. The results indicate that the UL 41 polypeptide is the <b>direct</b> <b>inducer</b> of host mRNA degradation following virus infection and that it is the only virion component directly required for this activity. A 382 -amino-acid nonsense polypeptide missing the last 107 residues of UL 41 lacked inhibitory activity, but was packaged into virions, while a 343 -amino-acid nonsense polypeptide lacked both inhibitory activity and the ability to be packaged...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDuring {{vertebrate}} limb development, the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) plays a {{vital role}} in both limb initiation and distal outgrowth of the limb bud. In the early chick embryo the prelimb bud mesoderm induces the AER in the overlying ectoderm. However, the <b>direct</b> <b>inducer</b> of the AER remains unknown. Here we report that FGF 7 and FGF 10, members of the fibroblast growth factor family, are the best candidates for the <b>direct</b> <b>inducer</b> of the AER. FGF 7 induces an ectopic AER in the flank ectoderm of the chick embryo in a different manner from FGF 1, - 2, and - 4 and activates the expression of Fgf 8, an AER marker gene, in a cultured flank ectoderm without the mesoderm. Remarkably, FGF 7 and FGF 10 applied in the back induced an ectopic AER in the dorsal median ectoderm. Our results suggest that FGF 7 and FGF 10 directly induce the AER in the ectoderm both of the flank and of the dorsal midline and that these two regions have the competence for AER induction. Formation of the AER of the dorsal median ectoderm in the chick embryo is likely to appear as a vestige of the dorsal fin of the ancestors...|$|E
40|$|The ethanol {{utilization}} (alc) pathway in Aspergillus nidulans {{is one of}} {{the strongest}} expressed gene systems in filamentous fungi. The pathway-specific activator AlcR requires the presence of an inducing compound to activate transcription of genes under its control. We have demonstrated recently that acetaldehyde is the sole physiological inducer of ethanol catabolism. In the present study we show that compounds with catabolism related to that of ethanol, i. e. primary alcohols, primary monoamines and l-threonine, act as inducers because their breakdown results in the production of inducing aliphatic aldehydes. Such aldehydes were shown to induce the alc genes efficiently at low external concentrations. When ethanol is mixed with representatives of another class of strong <b>direct</b> <b>inducers,</b> ketones, the physiological inducer, acetaldehyde, prevails as effector. Although <b>direct</b> <b>inducers</b> essentially carry a carbonyl function, not all aldehydes and ketones act as inducers. Structural features discriminating non-inducing from inducing compounds concern: (i) the length of the aliphatic side group(s); (ii) the presence and nature of any non-aliphatic substituent. These characteristics enable us to predict whether or not a given carbonyl compound will induce the alc genes...|$|R

In Centro Materno Infantil do Norte (CMIN), the maternal and perinatal care unit of Centro Hospitalar of Oporto (CHP), an intelligent pre-triage system is implemented, aiming to prioritize patients in need of gynaecology and obstetrics care in two classes: urgent and consultation. The system is designed to evade emergency problems such as incorrect triage outcomes and extensive triage waiting times. The current study intends to improve the triage system, and therefore, optimize the patient workflow through the emergency room, by predicting the triage waiting time comprised between the patient triage and their medical admission. For this purpose, data mining (DM) techniques are induced in selected information provided by the information technologies implemented in CMIN.

40|$|AmyR, a fungal {{transcriptional}} activator {{responsible for}} induction of amylolytic genes in Aspergillus nidulans, localizes to the nucleus {{in response to}} the physiological inducer isomaltose. Maltose, kojibiose, and d-glucose were also found to trigger the nuclear localization of GFP-AmyR. Isomaltose- and kojibiose-triggered nuclear localization was not inhibited by the glucosidase inhibitor, castanospermine, while maltose-triggered localization was inhibited. Thus, maltose itself {{does not appear to be}} an <b>direct</b> <b>inducer,</b> but its degraded or transglycosylated product does. Non-metabolizable d-glucose analogues were also able to trigger the nuclear localization, implying that these sugars, except maltose, directly function as the inducers of AmyR nuclear entry. The inducing activity of d-glucose was 4 orders-of-magnitude weaker compared with isomaltose. Although d-glucose has the ability to induce α-amylase production, this activity would generally be masked by CreA-dependent carbon catabolite repression. Significant induction of α-amylase by d-glucose was observed in creA-defective A. nidulans...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the role}} that Autoimmune Regulator (Aire) plays in the {{induction}} of central tolerance is well known, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms are still unclear and debated. In the prevailing view, Aire serves mainly as a <b>direct</b> <b>inducer</b> of tissue-specific antigens (TSAs). However, {{there is a growing}} amount of evidence suggesting that Aire modulates the differentiation program of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), which may directly contribute to the negative selection of self-reactive thymocytes. In addition, Aire has been shown to regulate the expression of many intrathymic chemokines that are required for the proper localization of thymocytes and dendritic cells (DCs), and thus are potentially important for direct and indirect self-antigen presentation in the thymic medulla. Further, recent evidence suggests that the induction of certain antigen-specific Tregs that translocate to tumors and peripheral tissues can be Aire dependent and may contribute to tissue-specific tolerance. This review summarizes the current understanding of the effects of Aire on these alternative mechanisms for the induction of Aire-induced central tolerance...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{response}} of pea embryonic tissues to the replication {{of a range}} of different viruses was investigated using in situ hybridization to analyze changes in the expression of two host genes, heat shock protein 70 (hsp 70) and lipoxygenase (lox 1). Excised pea embryos were infected using microprojectile bombardment with a nonseed transmissible strain of Pea seed-borne mosaic potyvirus, or with Pea early browning tobravirus (PEBV), White Clover mosaic potexvirus, or Beet curly top geminivirus. Collectively, these examples represent families of viruses with differing genomic features, differing numbers of genomic components and differing replication strategies. In all cases, there was an induction of hsp 70 associated with virus replication and, in most cases, a downregulation of lox 1. Hence, either each virus has a <b>direct</b> <b>inducer</b> of these common responses or the induction is indirectly the result of a generic feature of virus infection. By exploiting the bipartite nature of the PEBV genome, the coat protein gene and genes involved in vector transmission were excluded as potential inducers...|$|E
40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} β (TGFβ) {{signaling}} has an increasing interest in regenerative medicine {{as a potential}} tool to repair cartilages, however the chondrogenic effect of this pathway in developing systems is controversial. Here we have analyzed the function of TGFβ signaling in the differentiation of the developing limb mesoderm in vivo and in high density micromass cultures. In these systems highest signaling activity corresponded with cells at stages preceding overt chondrocyte differentiation. Interestingly treatments with TGFβs shifted the differentiation outcome of the cultures from chondrogenesis to fibrogenesis. This phenotypic reprogramming involved down-regulation of Sox 9 and Aggrecan and up-regulation of Scleraxis, and Tenomodulin through the Smad pathway. We further show that TGFβ signaling up-regulates Sox 9 in the in vivo experimental model system in which TGFβ treatments induce ectopic chondrogenesis. Looking for clues explaining the dual role of TGFβ signaling, we found that TGFβs appear to be <b>direct</b> <b>inducers</b> of the chondrogenic gene Sox 9, but the existence of transcriptional repressors of TGFβ signaling modulates this role. We identified TGF-interacting factor Tgif 1 and SKI-like oncogene SnoN as potential candidates for this inhibitory function. Tgif 1 gene regulation by TGFβ signaling correlated with the differential chondrogenic and fibrogenic effects of this pathway, and its expression pattern in the limb marks the developing tendons. In functional experiments we found that Tgif 1 reproduces the profibrogenic effect of TGFβ treatments...|$|R

Our previous analyses of rats exposed to building-derived WTC dusts using exposure scenarios/levels that mimicked FR mouth-breathing showed that a single WTC dust exposure led to changes in expression of genes whose products could be involved in the lung ailments, but few other significant pathologies. We concluded that rather than acting as <b>direct</b> <b>inducers</b> of many of the FR health effects, it was more likely inhaled WTC dusts instead may have impacted on toxicities induced by other rescue-related co-pollutants present in Ground Zero air. To allow for such effects to occur, we hypothesized that the alkaline WTC dusts induced damage to the normal ability of the lungs to clear inhaled particles. To validate this, rats were exposed on two consecutive days (222 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 h/d, by intratracheal inhalation) to WTC dust (collected 12 - 13 September 2001) and examined over a 1 -yr period thereafter for changes in the presence of ciliated cells in the airways and hyperplastic goblet cells in the lungs. WTC dust levels in the lungs were assessed in parallel to verify that any changes in levels of these cells corresponded with decreases in host ability to clear the particles themselves. Image analyses of the rat lungs revealed a significant decrease in ciliated cells and increase in hyperplastic goblet cells due to the single series of WTC dust exposures. The study also showed there was only a nominal non-significant decrease (6 - 11...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSmads are {{proteins}} that transduce signals {{on behalf of}} members of the TGFβ superfamily of growth factors. Recently, inhibitory Smads, Smad 6, Smad 7, and Dad, were isolated from human, mouse, and fly. These anti-Smads were shown to inhibit TGFβ signaling by stably associating to TGFβ type I receptors or, as it was shown for Smad 6, by binding to receptor-activated Smad 1. We report the cloning, distribution, and embryological activity of the Xenopus Smad 7 (XSmad 7). We report that XSmad 7 inhibits signaling from the activin and BMP pathways in animal explants although at different thresholds. When expressed in the embryo, low concentrations of XSmad 7 dorsalize the ventral mesoderm, thus inducing a secondary axis. At higher concentrations however, XSmad 7 inhibits both mesoderm induction and primary axis specification. In addition, we show that XSmad 7 acts as a <b>direct</b> neural <b>inducer</b> both in the context of ectodermal explants andin vivo. We discuss the implications of these findings in the biochemical context of the activin and BMP pathways as well as their implications in mesodermal, neural, and axis specification...|$|R

We have previously described an Escherichia coli bioreporter capable of detecting the presence of DNT vapors, harboring a fusion of the yqjF gene promoter to a reporter element. However, the DNT metabolite which is the <b>direct</b> <b>inducer</b> of yqjF, has not yet been identified, nor has the regulatory mechanism of the induction been clarified. We demonstrate here that the YhaJ protein, a member of the LysR type family, acts as a transcriptional regulator of yqjF activation, as well as of a panel of additional E. coli genes. This group of genes share a common sequence motif in their promoters, which is suggested here as a putative YhaJ-box. In addition, we have linked YhaJ to the regulation of quinol-like compound degradation in the cell, and identified yhaK as playing a role in the degradation of DNT...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial {{degradation}} of xylose is sequentially mediated by two enzymes – an isomerase (XutA) and a xylulokinase (XutB) – with xylulose as an intermediate. Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW 25, though capable of growth on xylose as a sole carbon source, encodes only one degradative enzyme XutA at the xylose utilization (xut) locus. Here, using site-directed mutagenesis and transcriptional assays, {{we have identified}} two functional xylulokinase-encoding genes (xutB 1 and xutB 2) and further show that expression of xutB 1 is specifically induced by xylose. Surprisingly, xyloseinduced xutB 1 expression is mediated by the mannitol-responsive regulator MtlR, using xylulose rather than xylose as the <b>direct</b> <b>inducer.</b> In contrast, expression of the xutA operon is regulated by XutR – a transcriptional activator of the AraC family – in a xylose-, xylulose- and ribose-dependent manner. Detailed genetic and biochemical analyses of XutR, including DNase I footprinting assays, suggest an unconventional model of XutR regulation that does not involve DNA-looping, a mechanism typically found for AraC-type regulators from enteric bacteria. XutR functions as a dimer and recognizes two inverted repeat sequences, but binding to one half site is weak thus requiring an inducer molecule such as xylose for activatio...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe have {{identified}} a family of RING finger proteins that are orthologous to Drosophila Goliath (G 1, Gol). One of the members, GREUL 1 (Goliath Related E 3 Ubiquitin Ligase 1), can convert Xenopus ectoderm into XAG- 1 - and Otx 2 -expressing cells {{in the absence of}} both neural tissue and muscle. This activity, combined with the finding that XGREUL 1 is expressed within the cement gland, suggests a role for GREUL 1 in the generation of anterior ectoderm. Although GREUL 1 is not a <b>direct</b> <b>inducer</b> of neural tissue, it can activate the formation of ectopic neural cells within the epidermis of intact embryos. This suggests that GREUL 1 can sensitize ectoderm to neuralizing signals. In this paper, we provide evidence that GREUL 1 is an E 3 ubiquitin ligase. Using a biochemical assay, we show that GREUL 1 catalyzes the addition of polyubiquitin chains. These events are mediated by the RING domain since a mutation in two of the cysteines abolishes ligase activity. Mutation of these cysteines also compromises GREUL 1 's ability to induce cement gland. Thus, GREUL 1 's RING domain is necessary for both the ubiquitination of substrates and for the conversion of ectoderm to an anterior fate...|$|E

To evaluate the role of FGFs in neural induction and patterning of the nervous system in chick embryos, we have targeted the ectopic expression of these factors by applying FGF-soaked beads to extended primitive streak chick embryos developing in culture. The whole embryo culture system allows to directly assessing the neural inducing activity on nonneural ectodermal cells. Our results show that FGFs induce the production of ectopic neural structures in the epiblast cell layer which are independent of the endogenous neural tube. The induced neural plates express several neural positional markers (Otx- 2, Krox- 20, EphA 4, EphA 7,andcHox-B 9), although they lack anterior neural markers such asBF- 1. These effects are very likely to be exerted by the direct action of FGF on epiblast cells because we have found no evidence of the induction of an organizer-like activity or of the presence of new axial mesoderm induced by the growth factor. We conclude that FGFs can act as <b>direct</b> neural <b>inducers</b> and that this action is exerted independently from the axial mesoderm...|$|R
40|$|Malonyl-CoA is an {{essential}} intermediate in fatty acid synthesis in all living cells. Here we demonstrate a new role for this molecule as a global regulator of lipid homeostasis in Gram-positive bacteria. Using in vitro transcription and binding studies, we demonstrate that malonyl-CoA is a <b>direct</b> and specific <b>inducer</b> of Bacillus subtilis FapR, a conserved transcriptional repressor that regulates the expression of several genes involved in bacterial fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis. The crystal structure of the effector-binding domain of FapR reveals a homodimeric protein with a thioesterase-like ‘hot-dog' fold. Binding of malonyl-CoA promotes a disorder-to-order transition, which transforms an open ligand-binding groove into a long tunnel occupied by the effector molecule in the complex. This ligand-induced modification propagates to the helix-turn-helix motifs, impairing their productive association for DNA binding. Structure-based mutations that disrupt the FapR–malonyl-CoA interaction prevent DNA-binding regulation and result in a lethal phenotype in B. subtilis, suggesting this homeostatic signaling pathway as a promising target for novel chemotherapeutic agents against Gram-positive pathogens...|$|R
40|$|The lactose {{repressor}} protein from the mutant E. coli BG 185 contains valine at position 81 instead of alanine (Adler et al., 1972; Muller-Hill et al., 1975). The BG 185 protein exhibits properties {{similar to the}} wild-type repressor-inducer complex. Kinetic measurements suggest that the structural transitions required for inducer binding are markedly impaired by the mutation. The fluorescence spectral shift in response to inducer binding was identical for mutant and wild-type proteins. This identity indicates <b>direct</b> effects of <b>inducer</b> binding on the tryptophan(s) near the sugar binding site rather than environmental changes consequent to conformational shifts. Analogy to the bacterial sugar binding proteins suggests that the alanine to valine change at position 81 in BG 185 repressor yields a molecule that is fixed in a closed, sugar-binding conformation. Serine 193 in the lactose {{repressor protein}} was changed to alanine and threonine to assess the putative role of this residue in allowing/blocking binding of β-substituted D-galactosides. The results demonstrate that the side chain of amino acid 193 does not play a <b>direct</b> role in <b>inducer</b> binding. Cysteine 281 was changed to serine and alanine in order to ascertain the contribution of this residue to the pH effects on inducer binding. A decrease in IPTG binding affinity for both mutants indicates a role for this residue in the optimal function of repressor, but does not account entirely for the pH effects on IPTG binding noted for the wild-type repressor modified with methyl methanethiosulfonate. The energetic contributions of the galactosyl hydroxyl groups of inducers to binding with repressor indicate that the C- 3 and C- 6 hydroxyls contributed <- 2. 3 and - 1. 7 ± 0. 3 Kcal/mol of binding free energy, respectively, whereas the C- 4 hydroxyl provided only a nominal contribution (- 0. 1 ± 0. 2 Kcal/mol). A change in Δ H∘ of ∼- 6 Kcal/mol upon replacement of the O-methyl substituent by S-methyl indicates {{a substantial increase in}} van der Waals' interactions and/or hydrogen bonding in this region of the ligand binding site. Arrhenius plots of kinetic rate constants for the binding of IPTG, methyl-β,D-galactoside, and methyl-β,D-thiogalactoside to the repressor revealed a protein structural transition at 12 ∘ C.

Growth under denitrifying conditions and induction of N oxide reductase synthesis are both restored by the presence of a plasmid containing the genes encoding the nitrate reductase.

In contrast, we show that nitrite induces the synthesis of the nitrate reductase. Complete denitrification, i. e., reduction of nitrate into ni-trous oxide or dinitrogen, is a bioenergetic process used by several species of bacteria. Four nitrogen oxide (N oxide) re-ductases (nitrate, nitrite, NO, and N 2 O reductases) are neces-sary to complete this reaction.

Contrary to COX- 1, which is constitutively expressed, COX- 2 expression is subject to regulation. For example, COX- 2 levels are increased in inflammatory reactions. Many signalling pathways can regulate COX- 2 expression, not least those involving receptors for COX products themselves. Analysis of the intracellular signal transducers involved reveals a crucial role for cAMP, albeit as a modulator rather than <b>direct</b> <b>inducer.</b> Indeed, the influence of cAMP on COX- 2 expression is complex and dependent on the cell type and cellular environment. This review aims to summarise various topics related to cAMP-dependent COX- 2 expression. Firstly, the main aspects of COX- 2 regulation are briefly considered. Secondly, the molecular basis for COX- 2 gene (post) -transcriptional regulation is reviewed. Lastly, a detailed overview {{of the effects of}} cAMP-dependent signalling on COX- 2 mRNA and protein expression in various human and rodent cells is provided. There is a large number of marketed, clinical and preclinical concepts promoting the elevation of intracellular cAMP levels for therapeutic purposes (e. g., β 2 -agoinsts, PG receptor agonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors).

However, most studies so far have used individual recombinant cytokines in high concentrations, unlikely to be found in vivo. We aimed to investigate how cytokines produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) affect fibroblast functions. Primary airway fibroblasts where incubated with allergen-stimulated or non-stimulated PBMC supernatants from allergic patients. The levels of cytokines in PBMC supernatants were measured and the expression of CD 54, CD 40 and CD 106 as well as the production of eotaxin, interleukin (IL) - 6 and IL- 8 were assessed in fibroblasts. Although the levels of single cytokines measured in PBMC supernatants were low, a significant up-regulation of the surface molecules as well as of IL- 6 and IL- 8 production was found in fibroblasts cultured with allergen-stimulated PBMC supernatants as compared to non-stimulated, while the increase in eotaxin production was not significant. The evaluation of correlations between cytokines produced by PBMC and effects seen on fibroblasts did not indicate a crucial role for any single cytokine. Furthermore, the addition of comparably low concentrations of recombinant interferon (rIFN) -γ or recombinant tumour necrosis factor (rTNF) -α did not induce the same effects as PBMC supernatants, the only exception being TNF-α as a <b>direct</b> <b>inducer</b> of CD 54 expression.

Different responses and sensitivities were observed depending on the types and concentrations of mixtures of inducers or metals. In the case of inducer mixtures, antagonistic and synergistic modes of action were observed, whereas metal mixtures showed all three modes of action. Antagonistic mode of action was most common for mixtures of indirect inducers, which showed bioluminescence ranging from 29 % to 62 % of theoretically expected effects (P(E)). On the other hand, synergistic mode of action was observed for mixtures of <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>inducers,</b> which showed bioluminescence between 141 % and 243 % of P(E).

Although zinc or dexamethasone induce MT directly when added to the culture medium of human hepatic (Chang) cells, endotoxin added to the culture medium {{was found to be}} ineffective in inducing MT synthesis. Since MT was induced during acute phase alteration, I focussed on the role of macrophages. I found that the conditional medium from endotoxin-activated macrophages ("MΦ+LPS") induced MT synthesis in Chang cells, while the incubation medium of nonactivated macrophages did not. Primary induction by zinc, copper or cadmium in "MΦ+LPS" was denied, because the concentrations of these metals in "MΦ+LPS" were almost the same as in the control medium. To clarify the details of the process of MT induction, the kinetics of MT synthesis by "MΦ+LPS" in Chang cells were studied and compared with the kinetics of MT synthesis by zinc and dexamethasone in Chang cells. "MΦ+LPS" induces MT synthesis, proportionally to the concentration of "MΦ+LPS", whereas zinc and dexamethasone induce MT sigmoidally and biphasically, respectively. On the other hand, the time course of MT induction by "MΦ+LPS" is similar to that by zinc, but different from that by dexamethasone. I conclude that: 1. Macrophages activated by endotoxin release a new factor which induces MT synthesis in human hepatic cells. 2. The new factor is different from dexamethasone and zinc...|$|R

The biosynthesis of these secondary metabolites is frequently induced by plant-derived external elicitors and appears to also be regulated by internal inducers, which may work in a way similar to that of bacterial autoinducers. The biosynthesis of penicillin in Penicillium chrysogenum is an excellent model for studying the molecular mechanisms of control of gene expression due to a good knowledge of the biochemistry and molecular genetics of β-lactam antibiotics and to the availability of its genome sequence and proteome. In this work, we first developed a plate bioassay that allows <b>direct</b> testing of <b>inducers</b> of penicillin biosynthesis using single colonies of P. chrysogenum. Using this bioassay, we have found an inducer substance in the conditioned culture broths of P. chrysogenum and Acremonium chrysogenum. No inducing effect was exerted by γ-butyrolactones, jasmonic acid, or the penicillin precursor δ-(l-α-aminoadipyl) -l-cysteinyl-d-valine. The conditioned broth induced penicillin biosynthesis and transcription of the pcbAB, pcbC, and penDE genes when added at inoculation time, but its effect was smaller if added at 12 h and it had no effect when added at 24 h, as shown by Northern analysis and lacZ reporter studies. The inducer molecule was purified and identified by mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as 1, 3 -diaminopropane.

Soluble P-selectin (sP-sel) is shed from activated platelets and endothelial cells. Mice genetically engineered to express P-selectin without the cytoplasmic tail (ΔCT) constitutively show a 3 - to 4 -fold increase of sP-sel in plasma. We {{observed that the}} ΔCT mice formed fibrin very readily. In an ex vivo perfusion chamber, there was more fibrin deposited {{at the site of}} platelet thrombus formation than in wild type (WT), whereas no fibrin deposits were detected using P-selectin-deficient blood during the same interval. Similarly, in vivo, the hemorrhage produced by local Shwartzman reaction was smaller in the ΔCT mice than in WT. In contrast, we previously showed hemorrhage to be more prominent in P-selectin knock-out mice. Infusion of mouse P-sel-Ig chimera produced the same protective effect in WT mice as seen in the ΔCT mice, indicating that the effect was due to increased levels of sP-sel. Mice infused with P-sel-Ig showed significantly more fibrin deposited on the luminal face of the injured vessels than control mice. Plasma from ΔCT mice or mice infused with P-sel-Ig contained higher concentration of pro-coagulant microparticles and clotted one minute faster than WT. This pro-coagulant phenotype of ΔCT mice could be reversed by a 4 -day treatment with PSGL-Ig, a P-selectin inhibitor. We propose that sP-sel should no longer be considered only as a marker of inflammation or platelet activation, but also as a <b>direct</b> <b>inducer</b> of pro-coagulant activity associated with vascular and thrombotic diseases...|$|E

This determinant has been proposed to be either Vg 1, an endodermally derived molecule that can directly induce ectoderm to form dorsal mesoderm, or a member of the Wnt family, which patterns the ectoderm such that it forms dorsal mesoderm in response to ventral inductive signals. In this study, we have investigated whether the endogenous dorsal determinant(s) functions as a <b>direct</b> <b>inducer</b> of dorsal mesoderm (Vg 1 -like) or whether it acts to pattern the response of ectoderm to inductive signals (Wnt-like). We report here that cortical rotation enhances both the dorsal-inductive activity of endodermal cells and the response of ectodermal cells to endogenous inductive signals and that both of these activities are required for notochord induction in ectoderm/endoderm recombinants. While ectopically expressed Xwnt- 8 b can substitute for the dorsalizing signals activated in either ectoderm or endoderm, and can allow notochord formation in recombinants, Vg 1 alone is not sufficient to induce notochord in ectodermal explants in the absence of signals activated by cortical rotation. Coexpression of Xwnt- 8 b along with Vg 1 restores ectodermal competence to form notochord. Finally, in endodermal explants, ectopically expressed Xwnt- 8 b, but not Vg 1, can divert the fate of ventral endodermal cells along a dorsal pathway. Thus, while Vg 1 is most likely required for induction of mesodermin vivo,our data suggest that a maternal Wnt-like signal acts synergistically with Vg 1 to specify a dorsal fate not only in the mesoderm, but also in the endoderm...|$|E
40|$|By {{screening}} for octopine-inducible gene expression, we previously identified all the genes required for utilization of octopine {{as a source}} of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. They are (i) octopine oxidase, which converts octopine to arginine and pyruvate and is encoded by the ooxAB operon, (ii) arginase, which converts arginine to ornithine and urea and is encoded by arcA, (iii) ornithine cyclodeaminase, which converts ornithine to proline and ammonia and is encoded by the homologous arcB and ocd genes, and (iv) proline dehydrogenase, which converts proline to glutamate and is encoded by putA. Here we describe the regulation and localization of each of these genes. The ooxA-ooxB-ocd operon was previously shown to reside on the Ti plasmid and to be directly inducible by octopine. The arcAB operon is directly inducible by arginine, while it is induced by octopine only in strains that can convert octopine to arginine. Ornithine may also be a <b>direct</b> <b>inducer</b> of arcAB. putA is directly inducible by proline, while induction by octopine and by arginine (and probably by ornithine) requires their conversion to proline. Genetic studies indicate that arcAB and putA are localized on a conjugal genetic element. This element can be transferred to other Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains by a mechanism that does not require recA-dependent homologous recombination. Transfer of this genetic element from A. tumefaciens R 10 requires at least one tra gene found on its Ti plasmid, indicating that this element is not self-transmissible but is mobilizable by the Ti plasmid. The DNA containing the arcAB and putA genes comigrates with a 243 -kb linear molecular weight standard on field inversion electrophoretic gels...|$|E
40|$|Coordinate {{induction}} {{of phase}} 2 proteins and elevation of glutathione protect cells against the toxic and carcinogenic effects of electrophiles and oxidants. All inducers react covalently with thiols at rates that {{are closely related}} to their potencies. Inducers disrupt the cytoplasmic complex between the actin-bound protein Keap 1 and the transcription factor Nrf 2, thereby releasing Nrf 2 to migrate to the nucleus where it activates the antioxidant response element (ARE) of phase 2 genes and accelerates their transcription. We cloned, overexpressed, and purified murine Keap 1 and demonstrated on native gels the formation of complexes of Keap 1 with the Neh 2 domain of Nrf 2 and their concentration-dependent disruption by inducers such as sulforaphane and bis(2 -hydroxybenzylidene) acetone. The kinetics, stoichiometry, and order of reactivities of the most reactive of the 25 cysteine thiol groups of Keap 1 have been determined by tritium incorporation from [3 H]dexamethasone mesylate (an inducer and irreversible modifier of thiols) and by UV spectroscopy with sulforaphane, 2, 2 ′-dipyridyl disulfide and 4, 4 ′-dipyridyl disulfide (titrants of thiol groups), and two closely related Michael reaction acceptors [bis(2 - and 4 -hydroxybenzylidene) acetones] that differ 100 -fold in inducer potency and the UV spectra of which are bleached by thiol addition. With large excesses of these reagents nearly all thiols of Keap 1 react, but sequential reaction with three successive single equivalents (per cysteine residue) of dipyridyl disulfides revealed excellent agreement with pseudo-first order kinetics, rapid successive declines in reaction velocity, and the stoichiometric formation of two equivalents of thiopyridone per reacted cysteine. This finding suggests that reaction of cysteine thiols is followed by rapid formation of protein disulfide linkages. The most reactive residues of Keap 1 (C 257, C 273, C 288, and C 297) were identified by mapping the dexamethasone-modified cysteines by mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides. These residues are located in the intervening region between BTB and Kelch repeat domains of Keap 1 and probably are the <b>direct</b> sensors of <b>inducers</b> of the phase 2 system...|$|R
40|$|During {{the process}} of neurulation in vertebrates, the {{ectoderm}} is differentiated into several distinct tissue types including neural plate, epidermis, and neural crest. Recent works, mainly in Xenopzts, have focused upon molecular mechanisms that can direct ectoderm to neural fates. In the models, neural induction is initially caused by inhibition of BMP activities in ectoderm by secreted BMP antagonists Noggin, Chordin and Follisitalin that are induced in Spemann 2 ̆ 7 s organizer. Dorsal ectoderm that has low BMP signaling differentiated into neural plate and ventral ectoderm that has high BMP signaling differentiated into epidermis. However, neural crest induction is more complicated. Neural crest is induced at the border between prospective neural plate and prospective epidermis. One model suggests that an intermediate level of BMP signaling that is generated by the balance between the BMPs and BMP antagonists {{plays a role in}} establishing the neural crest fate in Xenopus. It was also reported that canonical Wnt signaling and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling enhances neural crest induction, cooperating with BMP antagonists. Several transcriptional factors that able to induced neural crest makers such as Zic-related genes were reported. But many of them can also induce neural plate makers and they are expressed in not only neural crest region but also neural plate, so it is complicated to understand how ectoderm diverge to neural plate and neural crest fates. In addition, positioning mechanism of neural-epidermal border and mechanism of neural crest induction are poorly understood. In order to understand of molecular mechanisms of ectodermal patterning, she first focused on the in vivo BMP activity that is a basis of the neural and epidermal induction. She performed visualization of endogenous BMP signaling using an antibody that preferentially recognizes BMP-stimulated form of Smads. BMP signaling system composed of several BMP ligands and receptors, and there are several negative regulators. Regulation of downstream target genes and their roles are complex. Therefore it is quite difficult to evaluate BMP signals by analyzing BMP target genes. A preferred method to evaluate BMP signaling in situ is to detect activated forms of intracellular signaling molecules specific for BMP. Smads 1, 5, and 8 are best characterized signaling components of BMP signals and believed to be mediating a major part of BMP activity. BMP signaling was observed uniformly in early blastula, but was restricted to the ventral side of the embryo from the late blastula stage. At gastrula in ventral ectoderm (prospective epidermis) and ventral mesoderm were stained intensively, and dorsal ectoderm (prospective neural plate) and dorsal mesoderm were less stained. These results support the proposed roles of BMPs as ventralizing factor and anti-neurulizing factors in Xenopus embryos. From late gastrula, a gradient of staining becomes evident in the dorsal ectoderm, along the anterior-posterior axis. In early neurula staining was gradually reduced along the DV axis in all three germ layers again indicating the presence of a BMP signaling gradient. During the neural tube forming stages, staining was observed at the dorsal part of neural tube. The location of staining in dorsal neural tube is also consistent with previous findings showing that BMP family members act as dorsalizing factors of the neural tube. The distinct gradient of staining was not observed in neural tube. So it seems that BMP activity is a short-range signal at least in the dorsal neural tube. Next she performed the functional analysis of a newly isolated homeobox gene that expressed neural-epidermal border. She identified a novel NK- 1 class homeobox gene named Nbx. Expression of Nbx was detected at neural-epidermal border at neural crest forming stages and partially overlapped with neural crest makers. Nbx has an Eh 1 repressor motif and act as a transcriptional suppressor. The gain-of-function analysis showed that Nbx suppressed neural plate makers. The inhibition of neural induction by Nbx overexpression caused expansion of epidermal maker into the neural plate, and suppressed neural crest induction at early neurula. In later stages, however enhanced expression of neural crest maker was observed at the injected region. Nbx {{is not likely to be}} a <b>direct</b> neural crest <b>inducer</b> because Nbx could not induce neural crest maker alone in the animal caps. Interestingly, co-injection of dominant negative form of BMP receptor and Nbx caused melanophore induction efficiently in animal caps. Overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Nbx (VP-Nbx-GR) expanded the neural plate markers such as Sox 2 and Otx 2, and suppressed neural crest marker Slug. Therefore, she speculated that Nbx may be an essential transcription factor to regulate neural-epidermal border by inhibiting the neural plate fate and direct to neural crest induction. The pattern of BMP signaling visualized in this work supports the model of neural and epidermal induction by BMP activity. Furthermore she had demonstrated that a novel homeobox gene Nbx may be essential for rigorous regional specification on neural-epidermal border and neural crest induction in the downstream process of pattern formation by BMP activity...|$|R

In the immunocompromised individual, B. henselae-induced angiogenesis, or bacillary angiomatosis, is characterized by vascular proliferative lesions {{similar to those in}} Kaposi's sarcoma. We hypothesize that B. henselae-mediated interaction with immune cells, namely, macrophages, induces potential angiogenic growth factors and cytokines which contribute in a paracrine manner to the proliferation of endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a <b>direct</b> <b>inducer</b> of angiogenesis, and interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), a potentiator of VEGF, were detected within 12 and 6 h, respectively, in supernatants from phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate-differentiated human THP- 1 macrophages exposed to live B. henselae. Pretreatment of macrophages with cytochalasin D, a phagocytosis inhibitor, yielded comparable results, suggesting that bacterium-cell attachment is sufficient for VEGF and IL- 1 β induction. IL- 8, an angiogenic cytokine with chemotactic properties, was induced in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC- 1) within 6 h of infection, whereas no IL- 8 induction was observed in infected THP- 1 cells. In addition, conditioned medium from infected macrophages induced the proliferation of HMEC- 1, thus demonstrating angiogenic potential. These data suggest that Bartonella modulation of host or target cell cytokines and growth factors, rather than a direct role of the bacterium as an endothelial cell mitogen, is the predominant mechanism responsible for angiogenesis. B. henselae induction of VEGF, IL- 1 β, and IL- 8 outlines a broader potential paracrine angiogenic loop whereby macrophages play the predominant role as the effector cell and endothelial cells are the final target cell, resulting in their proliferation...|$|E
40|$|The {{fibroblast}} {{growth factor}} 8 b (FGF 8 b) oncogene {{is known to}} be primarily involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of hormone-related cancers. Its role in other epithelial cancers has not been investigated, except for esophageal cancer, in which FGF 8 b overexpression was mainly found in tumor biopsies of male patients. These observations were consistent with previous findings in these cancer types that the male sex-hormone androgen is responsible for FGF 8 b expression. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a highly metastatic cancer of head and neck commonly found in Asia. It is etiologically associated with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection, inflammatory tumor microenvironment and relatively higher male predominance. Here, we reported {{for the first time that}} FGF 8 b is overexpressed in this EBV-associated non-hormone-related cancer of the head and neck, NPC. More importantly, overexpression of FGF 8 b mRNA and protein was detected in a large majority of NPC tumors from both male and female genders, in addition to multiple NPC cell lines. We hypothesized that FGF 8 b overexpression may contribute to NPC tumorigenesis. Using EBV-associated NPC cell lines, we demonstrated that specific knockdown of FGF 8 b by small interfering RNA inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas exogenous FGF 8 b stimulated these multiple phenotypes. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that in addition to NF-B signaling (a major inflammatory signaling pathway known to be activated in NPC), an important EBV oncoprotein, the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP 1), was found to be a <b>direct</b> <b>inducer</b> of FGF 8 b overexpression in NPC cells, whereas androgen (testosterone) has minimal effect on FGF 8 b expression in EBV-associated NPC cells. In summary, our study has identified LMP 1 as the first viral oncogene capable of directly inducing FGF 8 b (an important cellular oncogene) expression in human cancer cells. This novel mechanism of viral-mediated FGF 8 upregulation may implicate a new role of oncoviruses in human carcinogenesis. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW 25 is a gram-negative soil {{bacterium}} {{capable of}} growing on histidine {{as the sole}} source of carbon and nitrogen. Expression of histidine utilization (hut) genes {{is controlled by the}} HutC repressor with urocanate, the first intermediate of the histidine degradation pathway, as the <b>direct</b> <b>inducer.</b> Recent genome sequencing of P. fluorescens SBW 25 revealed the presence of hutD in the hut locus, which encodes a highly conserved hypothetical protein. Previous genetic analysis showed that hutD is involved in hut regulation, {{in such a way that}} it prevents overproduction of the hut enzymes. Deletion of hutD resulted in a slow growth phenotype in minimal medium with histidine as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. While the genetic evidence supporting a role of hutD in hut regulation is strong, nothing is known of the mechanism of HutD action. Here I have cloned and expressed the P. fluorescens SBW 25 hutD in E. coli. Purified HutD was subjected to chemical and structural analysis. Analytic size-exclusion chromatography indicated that HutD forms a dimer in the elution buffer. The crystal structure of HutD was solved at 1. 80 Å (R = 19. 3 % and Rfree = 22. 3 %) by using molecular replacement based on HutD from P. aeruginosa PAO 1. P. fluorescens SBW 25 HutD has two molecules in an asymmetric unit and each monomer consists of one subdomain and two ß-barrel domains. Comparative structural analysis revealed a conserved binding pocket. The interaction of formate with a highly conserved residue Arg 61 via salt-bridges in the pocket suggests HutD binds to small molecules with carboxylic group(s) such as histidine, urocanate or formyl-glutamate. The hypothesis that HutD functions via binding to urocanate, the hut inducer, was tested. Experiments using a thermal shift assay and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis suggested that HutD binds to urocanate but not to histidine. However, the signal of HutD-urocanate binding was very weak and detected only at high urocanate concentration (53. 23 mM), which is not physiologically relevant. The current data thus does not support the hypothesis of HutD-urocanate binding in vivo. Although the HutD-urocanate binding was not confirmed, this work has laid a solid foundation for further testing of the many alternative hypotheses regarding HutD function...|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} response to endotoxin mediated through the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) -MD- 2 receptor complex {{is directly related}} to lipid A structure or configuration. Endotoxin structure may also influence activation of the MyD 88 -dependent and -independent signaling pathways of TLR 4. To address this possibility, human macrophage-like cell lines (THP- 1, U 937, and MM 6) or murine macrophage RAW 264. 7 cells were stimulated with picomolar concentrations of highly purified endotoxins. Harvested supernatants from previously stimulated cells were also used to stimulate RAW 264. 7 or 23 ScCr (TLR 4 -deficient) macrophages (i. e., indirect induction). Neisseria meningitidis lipooligosaccharide (LOS) was a potent <b>direct</b> <b>inducer</b> of the MyD 88 -dependent pathway molecules tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP- 1), macrophage inflammatory protein 3 α (MIP- 3 α), and the MyD 88 -independent molecules beta interferon (IFN-β), nitric oxide, and IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP- 10). Escherichia coli 55 :B 5 and Vibrio cholerae lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) at the same pmole/ml lipid A concentrations induced comparable levels of TNF-α, IL- 1 β, and MIP- 3 α, but significantly less IFN-β, nitric oxide, and IP- 10. In contrast, LPS from Salmonella enterica serovars Minnesota and Typhimurium induced amounts of IFN-β, nitric oxide, and IP- 10 similar to meningococcal LOS but much less TNF-α and MIP- 3 α in time course and dose-response experiments. No MyD 88 -dependent or -independent response to endotoxin was seen in TLR 4 -deficient cell lines (C 3 H/HeJ and 23 ScCr) and response was restored in TLR 4 -MD- 2 -transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Blocking the MyD 88 -dependent pathway by DNMyD 88 resulted in significant reduction of TNF-α release but did not influence nitric oxide release. IFN-β polyclonal antibody and IFN-α/β receptor 1 antibody significantly reduced nitric oxide release. N. meningitidis endotoxin was a potent agonist of both the MyD 88 -dependent and -independent signaling pathways of the TLR 4 receptor complex of human macrophages.

40|$|Selenium {{was found}} to be a novel {{regulator}} of cellular heme methabolism in that the element induced both the mitochondrial enzyme delta-aminolevulinate synthase [succinyl-CoA:glycine C-succinyltransferase (decarboxylating); EC 2 - 3 - 1 - 37] and the microsomal enzyme heme oxygenase [heme, hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase(alpha-methene-oxidizing, hydroxylating); EC 1 - 14 - 99 - 3] in liver. The effect of selenium on these enzyme activities was prompt, reaching a maximum within 2 hr after a single injection. Other changes in parameters of hepatic heme metabolism occurred after administration of the element. Thirty minutes after injection the cellular content of heme was significantly increased; however, this value slightly decreased below control values within 2 hr, coinciding with the period of rapid induction of heme oxygenase. At later peroids heme content returned to normal values. Selenium treatment caused only a slight decrease in microsomal cytochrome P- 450 content. However, drug-metabolizing activity was severely inhibited by higher doses of the element. Unlike other inducers of delta-aminolevulinate synthase, which as a rule are also porphyrinogenic agents, selenium induction of this enzyme was not accompanied by an increase in the cellular content of prophyrins. When rats were pretreated with selenium 90 min before administration of heme, a potent inhibitor of delta-aminolevulinate synthase production, the inhibitory effect of heme of formation of this mitochondrial enzyme was completely blocked. Selenium, at high concentrations in vitro, was inhibitory to delta-aminolevulinate synthase activity. It is postulated that selenium may not be a <b>direct</b> <b>inducer</b> of heme oxygenase {{as is the case with}} trace metals such as cobalt, but may mediate an increase in heme oxygenase through increased production and cellular availability of "free" heme, which results from the increased heme synthetic activity of hematocytes. Subsequently, the increased heme oxygenase activity is in turn responsible for the lack of increase in the microsomal heme content, thus maintaining heme levels at normal values despite the highly increased activities of both heme oxygenase and delta-aminolevulinate synthase. It is further suggested that the increase in delta-aminolevulinate synthase activity is not due to a decreased rate of enzyme degradation or an activation of preformed enzyme, but to increased rate of synthesis of enzyme protein. Although selenium in trace amounts has been postulated to be involved in microsomal electron transfer process, the data from this study indicate that excess selenium can substantially inhibit microsomal drug metabolism...|$|E
40|$|The lipid {{mediator}} sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) {{has been identified}} as a new biological molecule that is involved in the modulation of multilateral immunological processes. In this context, topically administrated S 1 P inhibits the inflammatory reaction in an animal model of atopic dermatitis. Furthermore, {{for the first time the}} present work supplies clear evidence that a modulation of dendritic cell (DC) function contributes to the observed anti-inflammatory effect of local S 1 P application. The presence of S 1 P influences the essential step of DC activation, which is characterized by endocytosis of antigens. Stimulation of immature DC`s with S 1 P demonstrates a dose dependant reduction of antigen capture by these antigen presenting cells. In the present work, it was of great interest to specify the molecular mechanisms that lead to the S 1 P-induced reduction of endocytosis in immature skin DC`s. In an immature stage, DC`s are able to take up antigens via several different mechanisms. An examination of a mechanism affected by S 1 P indicated that this sphingolipid inhibits the screening of large volumes of fluid for antigens during macropinocytosis in DC`s. The present study shows that macropinocytosis is mediated by modulation of the PI 3 K activity, allowing a fine-tuned regulation of antigen capture. Furthermore, the present work indicates that S 1 P is able to reduce PI 3 K activity via the S 1 P 2 receptor subtype. Most interestingly, down regulation of S 1 P 2 receptor subtype not only prevents the inhibitory effect of S 1 P on antigen uptake but also increases the basal level of macropinocytotic capacity. These results provide evidence that S 1 P could be involved in the endogenous regulation of endocytosis in immature DC`s. This hypothesis has been substantiated by enhancing the endogenous biosynthesis of S 1 P using a <b>direct</b> <b>inducer</b> of SphK 1 activity. As expected, observed reduction of endocytosis by DC`s in the presence of the SphK 1 activator was accompanied by diminished phosphoinositid 3 -kinase activity. In agreement with previous studies the present work provides evidence, that an ABCC 1 transporter is involved in the secretion of the sphingolipid. In summary, the present work demonstrates an essential role of S 1 P in antigen capture by immature DC`s. Endocytosis is the initial step of the adaptive immune response. Thus, elucidation of related signalling pathways could significantly contribute to the establishment of new treatments for inflammatory diseases such as atopic dermatitis...|$|E
40|$|The {{critical}} prompt innate {{immune response}} is highly built upon {{the influx of}} neutrophils from the blood stream {{to the site of}} infection. In the battlefield, neutrophils sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through their pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) to launch a number of responses with the goal to defeat the invading pathogen. Neutrophils’ wide spectrum of responses ranges from reactive oxygen species production (ROS), phagocytosis, cytokine and chemokine secretion, and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. The NET scaffold is composed of nuclear chromatin which is armed with antimicrobial proteins. DNA traps are able to ensnare and kill microbes in the extracellular space and NET release concurs with cell death of the neutrophil. An increasing body of literature describes that NETs impose deleterious effects on the host itself in addition to their antimicrobial activity. These hazardous effects mainly stem from pro-inflammatory and tissue-destructive activity of NETs. These two diverse outcomes of NETs result in a series of effects on both host and pathogen. Therefore, it seems rational that NET formation is tightly regulated and not happening spontaneously. The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans captured and killed by NETs. This fungus has the remarkable ability to grow as budding yeast or as filamentous hyphae, and reversibly alternate between these morphotypes. Hyphae are the tissue-destructive, invasive and pro-inflammatory form of C.  albicans, whereas yeast is the proliferative, non-invasive form. Hence, it is important to find out how neutrophils discriminate between distinct growth forms of C.  albicans and how NET release is regulated in this regard. To assess neutrophils responses towards each growth form of C.  albicans, the mere ratio of each fungal morphotypes is an insufficient measure to describe comparable amounts used in infection experiments; we therefore used dry mass of fungal cells to serve as a common denominator for amounts of fungal cells with different morphotypes. As assessment of dry mass is laborious, we developed a quick correlative method, which quantified fungal metabolic activity corresponding to the actual dry mass. We applied this method in consecutive studies investigating the neutrophil responses specific to different morphotypes of C.  albicans. Positive and negative regulators of NET formation were investigated for this thesis in a mechanistic fashion. To identify how NET release is negatively regulated during C.  albicans infection we focused on anti-inflammatory receptors on neutrophils. We observed that adenosine signals via adenosine receptor reduces the amount of NETs exclusively in response to C.  albicans hyphae, the invasive, pro-inflammatory form. We identified adenosine receptor A 3 as the responsible receptor suggesting that targeting of adenosine A 3 would be a promising approach to control invasive fungal infection, since particularly during immune reconstitution invasive mycoses are frequently accompanied by hyperinflammation which additionally worsens the patient’s state. As unbalanced inflammation is harmful to the host, a situation reflected in autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, we aimed to find molecules, which are able to inhibit NET formation. Thus, we introduced the non-toxic agent tempol’’. During ROS-depended stimulation of NET formation via C.  albicans and phorbol esters, the stable redox-cycling nitroxide tempol efficiently blocked NET induction. We therefore proposed tempol as a potential treatment during inflammatory disorders where NET formation is out of balance. In quest for positive regulators of NET formation we found the major addictive component of tobacco and electronic cigarettes, nicotine, as compelling <b>direct</b> <b>inducer</b> of NET release. Interestingly, nicotine is associated with exacerbated inflammatory diseases exerting its pro-inflammatory activity via acetylcholine receptor by targeting protein kinase B (known as Akt) activation with no effect on NADPH oxidase complex in a ROS independent fashion. In consideration of neutrophils role in smoking-related diseases we propose targeting Akt could lower the undesirable effect of NET.   In conclusion, this thesis identified new modulators of NET formation in response to fungal infection and more broadly to other NET-inducing stimuli, which might have implications in forthcoming therapies...|$|E
