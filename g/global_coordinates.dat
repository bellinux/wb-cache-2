40|$|Abstract. The goal of {{dimensionality}} reduction or manifold {{learning for}} a given set of highdimensional data points {{is to find a}} low-dimensional parametrization for them. Usually it is easy to carry out this parametrization process within a small region to produce a collection of local coordinate systems. Alignment is the process to stitch those local systems together to produce a <b>global</b> <b>coordinate</b> system and is done through the computation of a partial eigendecomposition of a so-called alignment matrix. In this paper, we present an analysis of the alignment process giving conditions under which the null space of the alignment matrix recovers the <b>global</b> <b>coordinate</b> system up to an affine transformation. We also propose a post-processing step that can determine the <b>global</b> <b>coordinate</b> system up to a rigid motion. This in turn shows that Local Tangent Space Alignment method (LTSA) can recover locally isometric embedding up to a rigid motion. 1. Introduction. A...|$|R
