5000|$|The Associated Press quoted Ahmed {{following}} the US {{announcement of the}} deaths of three detainees at Guantanamo in June 2006, who were alleged to have committed suicide. He said, “There is no hope in Guantanamo. The only thing that <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> day after day is how to get justice or how to kill yourself. It is the despair - not the thought of martyrdom - that consumes you there.” He went on, [...] "A Saudi detainee in the cell {{in front of us}} had had enough. We could hear him rip up his sheets and tie it to the wire mesh roof of the cell. He jumped off his sink and tried to hang himself. We shouted to the military police and they came and saved him.” Last, he said, [...] "It’s weird because when we left we weren't even that religious, We were young - average British lads. Obviously if we knew what we were getting ourselves into we would have never gone.” ...|$|E
40|$|When {{you hear}} the word "{{homeless}} " what comes to your mind? When you see {{out of the side}} of your eye a person holding a sign asking for money, what <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind?</b> Do you wonder if the homeless person is an addict or even crazy? Do you wonder if the person holding the sign is a scammer trying to prey on people's sympathy? Or do you feel compassion, but just are not sure how to help? These are all questions I have at one time or another thought. And while it is good to question what you see, I also think it is good to take the time to learn about what you are seeing and do something to help. It may be true that some people are homeless due to poor choices or that some people try to scam others. But if you think about it, how humbling it is to hold a sign and ask strangers for help, you will find yourself giving that homeless person the benefit of the doubt. Now take this thought a step further and put yourself in the place of a homeless person. A homeless person is just like you and me- they just don't have a roof over their head. According to the last biennial survey released by the Champaign County Continuum of Care for January 2013, there were 214 homeless people in Champaign County. The number has gone down from 549 homeless in January of 2011. But these numbers are just estimates that depend on the openness of the individuals asked. Plus the term homeless can cover a broad spectrum of individuals- from those with no shelter at all to those who stay on a friend’s couch. Another factor taken into account is how long the person has been homeless. A person is deemed chronically homeless if they have been homeless for over a year or been homeless four or more times in three years and have a disabling condition...|$|E

Ford began her lecture by asking the class “What <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> when you decided what you were going to wear today?” This question opened up the class to discover what fashion means to them personally and how it shapes who they are as people.

5000|$|Chanakya {{then took}} Chandragupta to conquer Pataliputra, {{the capital of}} Nanda. He {{assembled}} an army using the wealth he had acquired through alchemy (dhatuvada-visaradan). The army suffered a severe defeat, forcing Chanakya and Chandragupta to flee the battlefield. They reached a lake while being pursued by an enemy officer. Chanakya asked Chandragupta {{to jump into the}} lake, and disguised himself as a meditating ascetic. When the enemy soldier reached the lake, he asked the 'ascetic' if he had seen Chandragupta. Chanakya pointed at the lake. As the soldier removed his armour to jump into the lake, Chanakya took his sword and killed him. When Chandragupta came out of the water, Chanakya asked him, [...] "What <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind,</b> when I disclosed your location to the enemy?" [...] Chandragupta replied that he trusted his master to make the best decision. This convinced Chanakya that Chandragupta would remain under his influence even after becoming the king. On another occasion, Chanakya similarly escaped the enemy by chasing away a washerman, and disguising himself as one. Once, he cut open the belly of a Brahmin who had just eaten food, and took out the food to feed a hungry Chandragupta.|$|R
2500|$|Rafferty {{was fired}} from the band on 31 January 2008, {{after a series of}} {{absences}} due to illness and long-standing rumours about his place in the band; drug addiction was also quoted as {{one of the reasons for}} his departure. Rafferty subsequently refuted these claims, saying that he had been fired from the band because he [...] "didn't think Konk was very good, and I said that." [...] Dan Logan, bassist with a local Brighton band Cat the Dog, was drafted in as a temporary replacement for Rafferty. After the departure of Rafferty, the band had considered splitting up. Singer Luke Pritchard had told The Sun's Something for the Weekend that [...] "Splitting does <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind.</b> It's hard to let go of something you care about so much. We have fans to think of." [...] Pritchard also discussed the possibility of Dan Logan joining the band as their new bassist, [...] "It's been really strange for us but it's something that had to happen. Dan hasn’t joined the band properly yet. We're trying him out, but I love playing with him." [...] In October 2008, Peter Denton - who had previously filled in for Rafferty during the Inside In/Inside Out touring cycle - was chosen as the permanent bassist.|$|R

Kovalainen came in a lap later while Barrichello was pushing to try and build a gap. Button and Räikkönen pitted on lap 18, the Finn coming out in eighth while Button rejoined in 11th. Barrichello came in on lap 19, the Brazilian had made a lot of ground as he rejoined just behind Lewis after being around 10 seconds adrift. But most {{importantly}} for Brawn he had jumped the other McLaren of Kovalainen. On lap 24, a lot of smoke was pouring from the rear end of Vettel's car and he retired with a suspected engine failure. Hamilton was ordered over the radio to try to cool down his rear brakes as the temperature were getting out of control, but he was unable to shake off the challenge of Barrichello in second. [...] "It has been fantastic. It has been a weekend that I will never forget especially because after five years you don’t forget how to do it, but it is tough.

5000|$|In the 2017 film Kong: Skull Island, Kong is scaled to be 104 ft tall, {{making it}} the biggest {{incarnation}} in the series. Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts stated in regards to Kong's immense stature, [...] The thing that most interested me was, how big {{do you need to}} make Kong, so that when someone lands on this island and doesn’t believe in the idea of myth, the idea of wonder - when {{we live in a world}} of social and civil unrest, and everything is crumbling around us, and technology and facts are taking over - how big does this creature need to be, so that when you stand on the ground and you look up at it, the only thing that can <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> is: [...] "That's a god!" [...] He also stated that the original 1933 look was the inspiration for the design saying, [...] We sort of went back to the 1933 version in the sense that he’s a bipedal creature that walks in an upright position, as opposed to the anthropomorphic, anatomically correct silverback gorilla that walks on all fours. Our Kong was intended to say, like, this isn’t just a big gorilla or a big monkey. This is something that is its own species. It has its own set of rules, so we can do what we want and we really wanted to pay homage to what came before…and yet do something completely different, and If anything, our Kong is meant to be a throwback to the ’33 version. I don’t think there’s much similarity at all between our version and Peter Jackson’s Kong. That version is very much a scaled-up silverback gorilla, and ours is something that is slightly more exaggerated. A big mandate for us was, How do we make this feel like a classic movie monster? [...] Co-Producer Mary Parent also stated that Kong is still young and not fully grown as she explains, [...] "Kong is an adolescent when we meet him in the film; he's still growing into his role as alpha.|$|R
