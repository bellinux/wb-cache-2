50|$|The year 1966 was {{a turning}} point in the history of the Faculty of Law and legal {{education}} in the country: Dean P.K. Tripathi and his team of dedicated teachers adopted and implemented almost all the recommendations, in the 1964 Report, of the Gajendragadkar Committee on Legal Education (appointed by Vice-Chancellor Dr. C.D. Deshmukh). The two-year LL.B. course was made a three-year (six semester) course with an internal examination at the end of each semester. There were major innovations in the method of teaching: the <b>discussion</b> <b>method</b> of teaching (the Socratic method of teaching) was to be followed and not simply the lecture method where students were merely passive recipients of information. Towards this end, the case method of teaching, with decided cases and other study materials being given to the students in advance, was introduced, which enabled the Delhi Law School to achieve the goal of making students active participants in the learning process, thereby also ensuring an in-depth study of law. Teacher participation in the management of the Law School was ensured through appointment of various committee with elected members.|$|E

The following <b>discussion</b> <b>methods</b> are analyzed {{from the perspective of the}} role demands that they make of students and teachers: (1) cooperative learning discussions; (2) the subject mastery discussion method; and (3) issues-oriented discussions. Developers of all three methods strongly recommend training students and teachers in their respective roles, and manuals have been prepared to specify role behaviors. In cooperative learning or in subject mastery discussions, the teacher is a resource expert and process observer, rather than a participant, but in issues-oriented discussion, the teacher participates as a moderator. When student discussions do not go well, there may be many explanations, such as role complexity, ambiguity about the nature of knowing, or ambiguity about the curriculum. Analysis of <b>discussion</b> <b>methods</b> indicates that they are most appropriate for helping students construct personal understandings of academic content. Three tables summarize teacher and student role behaviors in the three discussion types. (SLD) Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be made from the original document.

5000|$|It {{is called}} the [...] "Harkness" [...] <b>discussion</b> <b>method</b> because it was {{developed}} at Phillips Exeter Academy with funds donated in the 1930s by Edward Harkness. This is also named after the Harkness table and involves students seated in a circle, motivating and controlling their own discussion. The teacher acts as little as possible. Perhaps the teacher's only function is to observe, although he/she might begin or shift or even direct a discussion. The students get it rolling, direct it, and focus it. They act as a team, cooperatively, to make it work. They all participate, {{but not in a}} competitive way. Rather, they all share in the responsibility and the goals, much asany members share in any team sport.Although the goals of any discussion will change depending upon what's under discussion, some goals will always be the same: to illuminate the subject, to unravel its mysteries, to interpret and share and learn from other points of view, to piece together the puzzle using everyone's contribution. Discussion skills are important. Everyone must be aware of how to get this discussion rolling and keep it rolling and interesting. Just as in any sport, a number of skills are necessary to work on and use at appropriate times. Everyone is expected to contribute by using these skills.|$|E

Null hypothesis III was: there were no differences in the students satisfaction with respect to the two teaching methods. Three teachers and 151 students in six groups were selected to participate in this study. Each teacher taught two groups for one month in the Spring semester of 1992. During this month each group was taught by the lecture and <b>discussion</b> <b>methods,</b> each for two weeks. Four tests were given to the students: two pre-tests and two post-tests. One pre-test was given at the beginning of the first two weeks before the first treatment (lecture or discussion) was applied. The other pre-test was given at the beginning of the second two weeks after the second treatment (lecture or discussion) was received. The first and the second post-tests were given after completing the first and second treatments, respectively. The students 2 ̆ 7 test scores were recorded and used as data for measuring students 2 ̆ 7 learning achievement. For measuring students 2 ̆ 7 satisfaction, a questionnaire attached to the second post-test was distributed. The data for measuring both students 2 ̆ 7 learning achievement and satisfaction level were used to calculate the respective means, standard deviation, percentages, and t-test values.
