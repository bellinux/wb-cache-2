25|$|There are {{two methods}} of encoding/remembering music. The first process {{is known as}} {{relative}} pitch, which refers to a person's ability to identify the intervals between given tones. Therefore, the song is learned as a continuous succession of intervals. Some people can also use absolute pitch in the process; this is ability to name or replicate a tone without reference to an <b>external</b> <b>standard.</b> Relative pitch has also been credited by some with being the more sophisticated of the two processes as it allows for quick recognition regardless of pitch, timbre or quality, as well as having the ability to produce physiological responses, for example, if the melody violates the learned relative pitch. Relative pitch {{has been shown to}} develop at varying rates dependent on culture. Trehub and Schellenberg (2008) found that 5- and 6-year-old Japanese children performed significantly better at a task requiring the utilization of relative pitch than same-aged Canadian children. They hypothesized that this could be because the Japanese children have more exposure to pitch accent via Japanese language and culture than the predominantly stressed environment Canadian children experience.|$|E
2500|$|Absolute pitch (AP) is {{the ability}} to produce or {{recognize}} specific pitches without reference to an <b>external</b> <b>standard.</b> People boasting AP have internalized pitch references, and thus are able to maintain stable representations of pitch in long-term memory. AP is regarded as a rare and somewhat mysterious ability, occurring in as few as 1 in 10,000 people. A method commonly used to test for AP is as follows: subjects are first asked to close their eyes and imagine that a specific song is playing in their heads. Encouraged to start anywhere in the tune they like, subjects are then instructed to try to reproduce the tones of that song by singing, humming, or whistling. Productions made by the subject are then recorded on digital audio tape, which accurately preserves the pitches they sing avoiding the potential pitch and speed fluctuations of analog recording. Lastly, the subjects' productions are compared to the actual tones sung by the artists on the CDs. Errors are measured in semitone deviations from the correct pitch. This test, however, does not determine whether or not the subject has true absolute pitch, but rather is a test of implicit absolute pitch. Where true absolute pitch is concerned, Deutsch and colleagues have shown that music conservatory students who are speakers of tone languages [...] have a far higher prevalence of absolute pitch than do speakers of nontone languages such as English. For a test of absolute pitch see the [...] developed by Deutsch and colleagues at the University of California San Diego.|$|E

2500|$|Gauge {{symmetry}} {{is closely}} related to charge conservation. Suppose that there existed some process by which one could briefly violate conservation of charge by creating a charge q at a certain point in space, 1, moving it to some other point 2, and then destroying it. We might imagine that this process was consistent with conservation of energy. We could posit a rule stating that creating the charge required an input of energy E1=qV1 and destroying it released E2=qV2, which would seem natural since qV measures the extra energy stored in the electric field because of the existence of a charge at a certain point. Outside of the interval during which the particle exists, conservation of energy would be satisfied, because the net energy released by creation and destruction of the particle, qV2-qV1, would be equal to the work done in moving the particle from 1 to 2, qV2-qV1. But although this scenario salvages conservation of energy, it violates gauge symmetry. Gauge symmetry requires that the laws of physics be invariant under the transformation , which implies that no experiment should be able to measure the absolute potential, without reference to some <b>external</b> <b>standard</b> such as an electrical ground. But the proposed rules E1=qV1 and E2=qV2 for the energies of creation and destruction would allow an experimenter to determine the absolute potential, simply by comparing the energy input required to create the charge q at a particular point in space in the case where the potential is [...] and [...] respectively. The conclusion is that if gauge symmetry holds, and energy is conserved, then charge must be conserved.|$|E

40|$|AbstractComplex systems, Pattern-based Systems Engineering, and Model-based Systems Engineering are {{approaches}} to model system lifecycles and address engineered systems complexity. Each approach advocates languages, tools, and processes as supplements to traditional engineering processes; however, these approaches are not readily adopted. The challenge for these system modeling approaches {{is they are}} not linked to traditional engineering processes and require unique tools and languages independent of traditional engineering domains. Furthermore, {{the knowledge of the}} <b>external</b> <b>standards</b> and specifications used in traditional processes are not available to users of system modeling technology, and those who have knowledge of <b>external</b> <b>standards</b> and specifications do not have knowledge of system modeling technology. Moreover, embedding intelligence of <b>external</b> <b>standards</b> and specifications is available within traditional system modeling applications. The research goal is integrating the technology and processes employed by system modeling and traditional engineering to automate data creation, flow and validation through removal of barriers to rule-driven technology adoption. Rule-driven technology adoption should lead to efficiencies in creating and managing extremely large datasets through automation. The results project significant improvement to data quality and enterprise IT systems integration while reducing labor costs to; validate data, avoid and correct errors, and eliminate data omissions...|$|R
40|$|The {{definition}} of “expert performance ” is obviously vital to any analysis of expertise. If <b>external</b> <b>standards</b> exist, then the definition is straightforward: the correct answers determine expert performance. Unfortunately, <b>external</b> <b>standards</b> seldom exist in domains requiring expertise; {{that is why}} experts are needed in the first place. The purposes of this paper are (1) to review traditional methods for defining expert performance {{in the absence of}} <b>external</b> <b>standards</b> and (2) to present a promising new approach for assessing expert performance (labeled CWS for Cochran-Weiss-Shanteau). Eight traditional procedures are reviewed, along with discussions of their advantages and disadvantages. Then CWS is presented along with a technical elaboration. The CWS approach is illustrated through reanalyses of three previous studies of experts. A study of physicians revealed that expert diagnostic skill was related to both discrimination and consistency – the two components of CWS. In a study of agricultural judges, the sensitivity of CWS was demonstrated by its ability to distinguish between livestock judges with different subspecialties. In a study of auditors, CWS correctly linked group differences in expertise (experts vs. novices) to information relevance. These reanalyses demonstrate that CWS offers new insights into the nature of expertise.
