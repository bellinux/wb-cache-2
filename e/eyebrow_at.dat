5|$|Mansfield's {{publicity}} antics {{are another}} recurring theme in popular culture. On the season 32 episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Alec Baldwin (with musical guest Christina Aguilera), {{one of the}} commercial bumpers has Alec Baldwin PhotoShopped into the famous picture of Sophia Loren staring at Mansfield's chest at Romanoff's in Beverly Hills. It was a direct reference to publicity stunt of Mansfield in April 1957 intended to deflect attention from Loren during a dinner party in the Italian star's honor. Photographs of the encounter were published around the world. The most famous image showed Loren raising a contemptuous <b>eyebrow</b> <b>at</b> the American actress who, sitting between Loren and her dinner companion, Clifton Webb, had leaned over the table, allowing her breasts to spill over her low neckline and exposing one nipple. The photo of Sophia Loren sitting next to Jayne Mansfield and regarding her cleavage inspired other photographers too. In 1993, Daniela Federici created an homage with Anna Nicole Smith as Mansfield and New York City DJ Sky Nellor as Loren for a Guess Jeans campaign. Later, Mark Seliger took a picture named Heidi Klum at Romanoff's with Heidi Klum in a reproduction of the restaurant set. The meeting between Mansfield and Anton LaVey, the founder and high priest of the Church of Satan, was a much publicized and oft quoted event of her life, {{as well as the}} history of the Church.|$|E

6000|$|PHILIP. In hope {{to crush}} all heresy under Spain. But, Renard, I am sicker staying here Than any sea could make me passing hence, Tho' I be ever deadly sick at sea. So sick am I with biding for this child. Is it the fashion in this clime for women To go twelve months in bearing of a child? The nurses yawn'd, the cradle gaped, they led Processions, chanted litanies, clash'd their bells, Shot off their lying cannon, and her priests Have preach'd, the fools, of this fair prince to come; Till, by St. James, I find myself the fool. Why do you lift your <b>eyebrow</b> <b>at</b> me thus? ...|$|E
60|$|The old man {{raised his}} <b>eyebrows</b> <b>at</b> {{his wife and}} {{scratched}} his chin roughly.|$|R

60|$|And by {{prostitution}} I {{mean not}} simply the act {{of a woman who}} sells for money, and against her thoughts and preferences, her smiles and endearments and the secret beauty and pleasure of her body, but the act of anyone who, to gain a living, suppresses himself, does things in a manner alien to himself and subserves aims and purposes with which he disagrees. The journalist who writes against his personal convictions, the solicitor who knowingly assists the schemes of rogues, the barrister who pits himself against what he perceives is justice and the right, the artist who does unbeautiful things or less beautiful things than he might, simply to please base employers, the craftsman who makes instruments for foolish uses or bad uses, the dealer who sells and pushes an article because it fits the customer's folly; all these are prostitutes of mind and soul if not of body, with no right to lift an <b>eyebrow</b> <b>at</b> the painted disasters of the streets.|$|E
60|$|Once {{the idea}} had got into Lady Harman's head it stayed there very obstinately. She {{surveyed}} the things {{on the table before}} her with a slightly lifted <b>eyebrow.</b> <b>At</b> first she thought the idea of disposing of them an entirely dishonourable idea, and if she couldn't get it out of her head again at least she made it stand in a corner. And while it stood in a corner she began putting a price {{for the first time in}} her life first upon this coruscating object and then that. Then somehow she found herself thinking more and more whether among all these glittering possessions there wasn't something that she might fairly regard as absolutely her own. There were for example her engagement ring and, still more debateable, certain other pre-nuptial trinkets Sir Isaac had given her. Then there were things given her on her successive birthdays. A birthday present of all presents is surely one's very own? But selling is an extreme exercise of ownership. Since those early schooldays when she had carried on an unprofitable traffic in stamps she had never sold anything--unless we are to reckon that for once and for all she had sold herself.|$|E
6000|$|Shortly {{before the}} time he had fixed for his return he {{received}} from Mrs. Alsager a telegram consisting of the words: [...] "Loder wishes see you--putting Nona instant rehearsal." [...] He spent the few hours before his departure in kissing his mother and sisters, who knew enough about Mrs. Alsager to judge it lucky this respectable married lady was not there--a relief, however, accompanied with speculative glances at London and the morrow. Loder, as our young man was aware, meant the new [...] "Renaissance," [...] but though he reached home in the evening it was not to this convenient modern theatre that Wayworth first proceeded. He spent a late hour with Mrs. Alsager, an hour that throbbed with calculation. She told him that Mr. Loder was charming, he had simply taken up the play in its turn; he had hopes of it, moreover, that {{on the part of a}} professional pessimist might almost be qualified as ecstatic. It had been cast, with a margin for objections, and Violet Grey was to do the heroine. She had been capable, while he was away, of a good piece of work at that foggy old playhouse the [...] "Legitimate;" [...] the piece was a clumsy rechauffe, but she at least had been fresh. Wayworth remembered Violet Grey--hadn't he, for two years, on a fond policy of [...] "looking out," [...] kept dipping into the London theatres to pick up prospective interpreters? He had not picked up many as yet, and this young lady at all events had never wriggled in his net. She was pretty and she was odd, but he had never prefigured her as Nona Vincent, nor indeed found himself attracted by what he already felt sufficiently launched in the profession to speak of as her artistic personality. Mrs. Alsager was different--she declared that she had been struck not a little by some of her tones. The girl was interesting in the thing at the [...] "Legitimate," [...] and Mr. Loder, who had his eye on her, described her as ambitious and intelligent. She wanted awfully to get on--and some of those ladies were so lazy! Wayworth was sceptical--he had seen Miss Violet Grey, who was terribly itinerant, in a dozen theatres but only in one aspect. Nona Vincent had a dozen aspects, but only one theatre; yet with what a feverish curiosity the young man promised himself to watch the actress on the morrow! Talking the matter over with Mrs. Alsager now seemed the very stuff that rehearsal was made of. The near prospect of being acted laid a finger even on the lip of inquiry; he wanted to go on tiptoe till the first night, to make no condition but that they should speak his lines, and he felt that he wouldn't so much as raise an <b>eyebrow</b> <b>at</b> the scene-painter if he should give him an old oak chamber.|$|E
60|$|Chief Inspector Heat {{raised his}} <b>eyebrows</b> <b>at</b> the black, narrow back, which {{remained}} obstinately presented to his intelligence and his zeal.|$|R

5000|$|When the 1985 {{paper was}} {{released}} to public record by the Cabinet Office {{along with other}} Whitehall papers under accelerated procedures of the 30 years rule into the public record through the National Archives in Kew, West London on 30 December 2015, a chastened Letwin apologised {{on the same day}} for [...] "the offence caused." [...] Trevor Phillips OBE, former head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission observed that, [...] "I donâ€™t think these remarks would have raised a single <b>eyebrow</b> <b>at</b> the time." ...|$|E
50|$|The Rogues' {{last game}} ever came at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium against the Houston Hurricane. The Rogues won, 6-1. Tony Field scored the final goal in Memphis Rogues history. He beat the goalkeeper {{and walked the}} ball into the net. When he arrived at the goal line, he got down on his knees and headed {{the ball into the}} net. More skeptical fans and that the Rogues were mathematically {{eliminated}} from the playoffs and the Hurricane only need one goal to qualify, raised an <b>eyebrow</b> <b>at</b> the result. In the 1980 NASL goals of the year video, you can clearly see the Hurricanes standing still, allowing Field to give the fans one last show.|$|E
50|$|When {{they arrive}} at the house, Lady Jean (Isabella Rossellini) raises an <b>eyebrow</b> <b>at</b> Linet's disheveled condition. Linet apologizes, but tells her mother how she came close to {{actually}} seeing an elf; and if she doesn't look, then she'll never know for sure. As Lady Jean sends her inside to change, Peter comments to her how Linet is growing up and shows no fear. They then talk about how when her husband, Lord Percival, was in the castle, there was no danger. But since Percival's disappearance, his evil twin brother, Lord Godfrey, has taken over, {{and no one in}} the castle is safe, which is why Jean and Linet live in the country. As Jean stands, she suddenly sees Godfrey approaching, and Peter leaves.|$|E

60|$|But {{he looked}} so serious after he had made me that light answer, that the Major raised his <b>eyebrows</b> <b>at</b> me and I raised mine at the Major.|$|R

50|$|Lemebel {{attended}} writing workshops to hone {{his skills}} and network with other writers, his first writing recognition was in 1982, {{when he won}} an award for his short story, Porque el tiempo estÃ¡ cerca. In 1986, he published as his first major work, the book Incontables, a compilation of short stories under the feminist publication label, Ergo Sum. A year later, he co-founded a performance collective that used the tactics of intervention and disruption of events to raise public consciousness about the struggles of minorities in Chile. The disruption and performances of the collective brought Lemebel into public limelight in Chile. In 1986, he disrupted a meeting of Chile's left wing groups opposed to Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. He entered the meeting in high heels and with makeup on his face depicting an hammer and sickle extending from his mouth to his left <b>eyebrow.</b> <b>At</b> the event, he spoke about his manifesto, â€˜Manifest: I Speak for my Differenceâ€™ criticizing homophobia in left wing politics.|$|E

40|$|Background. Topiramate (TPM) is a psychotropic drug, {{which is}} used mainly as an {{antiepileptic}} drug and now over the years is used for {{a wider range of}} indications, including migraine prophylaxis and binge eating disorders. Although ocular side effects of Topiramate have been frequently reported, neuroophthalmologic manifestations such as myokymia are rarely reported. Case Presentation. This case report presents a case of a 47 -year-old woman who had begun TPM for binge eating problem. She developed unilateral long standing lower eyelid twitching, which progressed to upper eyelid and <b>eyebrow</b> <b>at</b> the same side. The patient was not a smoker or excessive alcohol or caffeine abuser. Increasing the resting time and changing life style made no significant changes in her eyelid twitching. There was no definite evidence by neuroimaging and clinical or laboratory evaluations causing eyelid myokymia. The symptoms resolved with discontinuation of TPM. Conclusion. Although eyelid myokymia is a benign and self-limited condition, it sometimes becomes a source of distress in chronic long standing cases. Physicians {{should be aware of the}} neuroophthalmologic side effects of this drug...|$|E
60|$|There was no answer. Sir Henry {{suddenly}} remembered another entrance from a newly added bathroom. He availed himself {{of it and}} found Philippa seated in an easy-chair, calmly progressing with her breakfast. She raised her <b>eyebrows</b> <b>at</b> his entrance.|$|R
5000|$|... "'Now, {{these numbers}} are a secret code, honey,' Arnold Friend explained. He read off the numbers 33, 19, 17 and raised his <b>eyebrows</b> <b>at</b> her {{to see what she}} thought of that, but she didn't think much of it." [...] (p. 41) ...|$|R
5000|$|The 30-year age {{difference}} between Isherwood and Bachardy raised <b>eyebrows</b> <b>at</b> the time, with Bachardy, {{in his own}} words, [...] "regarded {{as a sort of}} child prostitute," [...] but the two became a well-known and well-established couple in Southern Californian society with many Hollywood friends.|$|R
60|$|The Guatemalan general {{arrested for}} a moment the rhythmic action of his jaws, lowered his paper and looked at her with raised <b>eyebrows.</b> <b>At</b> first Jill thought that he was {{registering}} haughty contempt, then she saw what she had taken for scorn was surprise.|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{happened}} and, {{after waiting}} some minutes, Tuppence pressed the bell again, keeping her {{finger on the}} button for some little while.

50|$|After raising <b>eyebrows</b> <b>at</b> youth level, Anto {{began his}} top-flight career by signing for St. Patrick's Athletic in 2005.
