This case study investigates what components would need to be in place to rebrand or reposition the city as a unique, healthful destination. Case: A resident survey, interviews, and focus groups were used to gather qualitative data about residents??? perceptions of the city???s current brand and potential rebranding. Management & Outcome: Scope of work for the focus city included data gathering from residents, and <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects,</b> services, and designations to support marketing of the city as a health/wellness destination.

Further, City documents revealed a history of departmental rebrandings that may have obscured the City???s current brand image. Recommendations for the future include making no change of brand without resident and key stakeholder buy-in; sponsorship of health-related events versus rebranding; and possible creation of a staff position such as Public Health Specialist responsible for assessing the health impacts of City initiatives, resolutions, and policies, and assisting the City???s DMO in marketing healthful aspects of the City...|$|E
40|$|While the water–energy–food nexus {{approach}} {{is becoming increasingly}} important for more efficient resource utilization and economic development, limited quantitative tools are available to incorporate the approach in decision-making. We propose a spatially explicit framework that couples two well-established water and power system models to develop a decision support tool combining multiple nexus objectives in a linear objective function. To demonstrate our framework, we compare eight Nepalese power development scenarios based on five nexus objectives: minimization of power deficit, maintenance of water availability for irrigation to support food self-sufficiency, reduction in flood risk, maintenance of environmental flows, and maximization of power export. The deterministic multi-objective optimization model is spatially resolved to enable realistic representation of the nexus linkages and accounts for power transmission constraints using an optimal power flow approach. Basin inflows, hydropower plant specifications, reservoir characteristics, reservoir rules, irrigation water demand, environmental flow requirements, power demand, and transmission line properties are provided as model inputs. The trade-offs and synergies among these objectives were visualized for each scenario under multiple environmental flow and power demand requirements. Spatially disaggregated model outputs allowed for the comparison of scenarios not only based on fulfillment of nexus objectives but also scenario compatibility with existing infrastructure, supporting the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> that enhance overall system efficiency. Though the model {{is applied to the}} Nepalese nexus from a power development perspective here, it can be extended and adapted for other problems...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern from government, communities, civil society and mining {{companies}} on the sustained development of the impact of mining on communities and the benefits of mineral development. Communities are more vocal in expressing their expectations for benefits {{and on the other hand}} mines are concerned about profits and maintaining a social licence to operate. This study critically evaluates the impact mining has on socio-economic development in mining communities. The focus area of the study is the West Rand District Municipality in Gauteng Province, South Africa. The ‘impact’ refers to the mine’s contribution to infrastructure development and poverty reduction projects in areas where the mine is operating and sourcing labour from. Forecasts for better performance in the future will be assessed. Issues such as community consultation, <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects,</b> development forums, the Integrated Development Plan (IDP) and partnerships are addressed. The literature was reviewed from existing national and international research on the topic. The study starts from two assumptions. The first is that minerals are potentially a great resource of wealth for poor countries. The second assumption is that minerals have the potential to benefit the local population through the creation of indirect employment, skills transfer, enhancing the capacity of health and education services, improved infrastructure and small and medium business opportunities. Poverty levels are viewed on a national and international scale. The study reveals problems, with existing approaches, on mine community development. It concludes that the impact of mining on infrastructure development and poverty reduction projects can be huge, but only if a variety of demanding preconditions are met. The study concludes that the reality of mineral led development in mine communities has not lived up to a roaring promise...|$|E

It also looks into the organizational arrangements for planning and implementation of the scheme. Various institutional aspects in the form of Guidelines, Rules and Regulations brought out by the Government of Kerala have also been examined. The <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> for NREGA is a grass root level activity with Ward Development Committee and Area Development Society of Kudumbasree playing a pivotal role. The role of Grama Sabha in the formulation of a ward level Action Plan is found to be weak. The worker registration is appreciably good in all the three Grama Panchayats. Registration of SC and ST categories also is impressive. But there is a big drop {{in the number of people}} who demanded jobs in 2007 - 08. It is below one fourth in two Panchayats and just above one third in the third Panchayat. There is a further drop in the number in the succeeding year. The rosy part is that all those who demanded jobs have been provided with jobs. The percentage of man-days generated for SC and ST categories is very low compared to that of the general category. Women of the general category constituted the major beneficiaries of NREGA. Unskilled wages constituted the major component of expenditure. The number of projects is large, most of them not leading to creation of public durable assets. There is lack of integration with other schemes implemented at local level. The scheme is successful in raising the level of employment and income of the rural household, there by enhancing their purchasing power. Working in groups has empowered the women socially. In some cases NREGA works and agricultural works were operational at the same time aggravating the problem of labour shortage in agriculture.

40|$|The thesis investigates {{construction}} project cash flows. It {{is divided into}} two main components. The first investigates the cumulative gross cash flow profiles (S curves), and the second examines the cumulative net cash flow profiles. The gross cash flow model can be used by either construction industry clients or contractors, whereas the net cash flow model concerns the contractor. Interest in {{construction project}} cash flows resulted from changed economic pressures in the 1970 s. A rise in inflation was associated with increased client attention to his gross cash flows to the contractor, and similarly higher interest rates had the effect that contractors became concerned with their net cash flows. An examination of the gross cash flow literature found that most models were aimed at discovering generally applicable ideal curves. A similar situation existed within the net cash flow literature. It was argued that the averaging approach is unsuitable for construction project cash flow research, and consequently an approach which concentrates on the individual project was pursued. A gross cash flow model was developed using logistic transformation regression procedures. This yielded excellent results for post-hoc analysis of individual project data. Furthermore the gross cash flow model was found to be suitable for the generation of a construction project net cash flow model, which was similarly oriented towards the post-hoc analysis of single projects. A measure of deviation was used which enabled the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> for which the gross cash flow model was a poor fit. This same procedure was used to exclude projects from the net cash flow analysis. The results from the gross cash flow model analysis indicate that projects do vary considerably from one to another, and this supports the contention made that an individual approach to this research is necessary. The net cash flow model yields an excellent trend line for net cash flow on a project, and thus provides an excellent means for senior management to judge the quality of management employed on a projectRestricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E

The creation of the IUPUI Signature Center for Pancreatic Cancer Research has been the foundation for putting IUPUI, the IU School of Medicine, Purdue University and the IU Simon Cancer Center at the forefront of pancreatic cancer treatment and research across the nation. The Signature Center, comprised of basic, translational and clinical researchers, represents the continuum of the disease from biological / molecular investigation to clinical trials. Funding from the Signature Center Initiative is being utilized to develop genetically engineered mouse models, generate orthotopic pancreatic cancer mouse models, develop cancer associated fibroblast lines to be used as a shared resource as well as provide funding for peer reviewed pilot projects led by young investigators. Establishment and characterization of these cell lines and in vivo models provides the groundwork for these resources to be used by all members in their translational research projects.

40|$|The {{important}} role that devolved funds plays in Kenya’s development process is recognised. The overall image {{that emerges from}} the literature on devolved funds is on importance, absorptive capacities, and allocative rationale and governance issues surrounding {{the operations of the}} funds. However, conceptual awareness on the factors that influence citizen participation in devolved schemes is not known. The main objective of the study is to examine the factors that influence citizen participation in devolved funds in Uasin Gishu (UG) County, Kenya. Specifically, the study examined the socio-demographic characteristics, the social institutions, and the devolved funds design influence on citizen participation in the funds. It further sought to determine the proportion of households participating in the funds, draw lessons of experience on the funds, what does and does not work, where, why and under what conditions, and identify policy options and appropriate program designs to improve the funds. The study draws from institutional theory to analyse participation because institutions provide frames of meaning which guide human action. Building on the theory, the study developed a conceptual framework to describe concepts guiding the study. The framework explains graphically the main things studied and the presumed relationships among them. The study area is in Kenya, a country with devolved form of government. Fieldwork was located in UG County. Primary data was gathered through expert interviews with 32 funds officials and household survey with 530 respondents. Further data was obtained from secondary sources. Data from expert interviews was analysed using thematic analysis, survey data was analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), while data from secondary sources was analysed by documentary review.

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{problems}} connected with adaptation of a strategic approach {{to the process of}} a local development planning by local authorities in the Silesia region. This approach have been popularised among the local governments in Poland {{in the second half of}} the 90 ?s mainly due to the possibilities of utilisation of the EU pre-accession funds (e. g. PHARE). Hence the paper is an attempt of evaluation of the local development strategies utility in polish conditions under the experiences of the Silesian county towns. On the basis of the questionnaires and interviews? carried out among all the Silesian county towns and cities with the local authorities? representatives (mainly mayors and head of local government departments) ? cross-evaluation was shown in the following aspects: methodology of local development strategy formulation; comprehension by local authorities the terms of development, strategies, goals, objectives; projects identification and defining; motivation which drives to take up the works on a strategy documentation; organisational changes connected with the strategy implementation process as well as real results and impacts of the strategies. In the field of the strategic planning methodology the degree of the advancement in using the strategy approach by local self-government was determined. Groups of county towns and cities with relatively great and small record of experience in using a strategy was distinguish. The research also was focused on the towns which have not a strategy, but their process of local development is visible with the naked eye. The above mentioned case studies enabled to do evaluation of the strategy approach usefulness in local development planning. It was also shown the participation of local communities, SMEs and other institution in a strategy formulation. Very interesting was the survey findings connected with the motivation of carry out the strategy formulation process and perceiving its desire effects. The general typology of motivation stimulus was shown. For example, it contains factors like: intentions to change a town image, desire to attract external investors, improving the local government effectiveness as well as imitation of behaviours of other towns and cities. The attention was also paid on the process of the strategic goals and objectives creation, their evaluation measures and <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects.</b> The research confirmed a number of disagreements between objectives and projects and the lack of objectives measurement that, in practice enables to evaluate the advancement of their realisation. One of the key weaknesses of Silesian county towns strategies is the practice of defining the objectives in the large -extent that makes loss of concentration on serious local problems and ability to list almost unlimited number of projects, with a lack of hierarchy among them. Another aspect of the paper is focused on determination of using projects assessment methods by local governments in the financial, economical, environmental, social, technological, and risk aspects. The Silesia region experience proves a lack of system approach to project assessment and evaluation as well as problems with clear choice criteria determination. ...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. Ladysmith {{is a town}} {{situated}} {{on the banks of}} the Klip River in the uThukela District of KwaZulu Natal, and falls into the Emnambithi-Ladysmith Local Municipality. The labour force of the Emnambithi-Ladysmith Local Municipality makes up 32. 48 % of the population within the municipality, of which 16. 49 % are employed, and 15. 99 % are unemployed. A further 22. 21 % of the total population in the municipality are not economically active, i. e. are students, homemakers, disabled, too ill to work, or are not seeking work. In an effort to address the poverty within KwaZulu Natal, the Department of Economic Development initiated a process which identified potential poverty-relieving initiatives and proposed to further investigate these development projects to establish which of the identified alternatives would be most feasible and beneficial to target communities. The areas where the poor communities are situated were identified based on the potential ability of the community to be able to support the required infrastructure investment and product development, which were in turn focussed on emerging economic growth points and development corridors (DEAT, 2001). One of the communities identified which could potentially benefit from one of the proposed development projects was that of the Emnambithi-Ladysmith Municipality, in KwaZulu Natal. Emnambithi-Ladysmith Local Municipality appointed a consultant to compile a Local Economic Regeneration Study for Ladysmith and the rural communities of the locality. The Study is aimed at analysing the local economy and thereby finding economic strategies that will make optimum use of local resources to create sustainable job opportunities and means of redressing economic challenges such as retrenchment and unemployment. A significant component of the Study is the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects,</b> which promote local ownership, local jobs and local reinvestment and illustrate the potential to revitalise the local economy of Emnambithi (Urban Econ, 2005). One of the alternative potentially sustainable poverty relief proposals put forward by the consultants, and other relevant parties, was that of harvesting the plant parts of the Aloes which appeared to be abundant within the Emnambithi-Ladysmith Municipality area. It was proposed that an Aloe pre-processing factory be established in a suitable location, which would provide employment opportunities for the local poor communities, who would either be directly employed by the pre-processing factory, or would be appropriately trained to harvest the required raw material from the natural Aloe populations. Similar operations have been initiatedin the Southern and Eastern Cape by formal sector businesses, which produce products made from Aloe ferox, which are then either sold locally or exported. The sustainability of the harvesting of these plants was determined based on the number of leaves which can be harvested per day by a tapper. It was possible to determine that the Aloe marlothii populations within the study area will not be able to support the harvesting of leaves, and as such, the harvesting thereof will not be sustainable. Several recommendations have been made which will further refine the results of this project. The main shortfall of this study was the limitation of the study area by political boundaries. It is thus recommended that a study be conducted which includes all Aloe marlothii habitat areas occurring in the rocky hillsides surrounding Ladysmith, regardless of Ward boundaries...|$|E

As far as project management is concerned, data interpretation can support the assessment <b>of</b> the current <b>project</b> status and the achievement <b>of</b> <b>project</b> goals and requirements. As far as empirical studies are concerned, data interpretation can help to draw conclusions from collected data, support decision making, and contribute to better process, product, and quality models. With the increasing availability and usage <b>of</b> data from <b>projects</b> and empirical studies, effective data {{interpretation is}} gaining more importance. Essential tasks such as the data-based <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>project</b> risks, the drawing of valid and usable conclusions from individual empirical studies, or the combination of evidence from multiple studies require sound and effective data interpretation mechanisms. This article sketches the progress {{made in the last}} years with respect to data interpretation and states needs and challenges for advanced data interpretation. In addition, selected examples for innovative data interpretation mechanisms are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{technological}} changes {{along with}} political, social and economical decisions {{have led the}} IT and Telecommunications industry to become a very dynamic and changing sector. Partnerships {{at the international level}} are everywhere and the stronger influence of IT represent high-risk potential. Statistics show that 70 % <b>of</b> IT <b>projects</b> are out <b>of</b> time or budget or simply fail. With such perspectives, measures ought to be taken to avoid the further replication of this pattern. The risk of failure is perceived to be greater as projects rely on players with different cultural backgrounds increasing managerial complexity and supposedly requiring a unique set of skills. Efforts should be aimed to find out the management profile necessary to avoid pitfalls in the implementation <b>of</b> technology <b>projects</b> and provide practitioners with a culture-based project management practice. The research will allow the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>project</b> management patterns and preferences consisten...|$|R
