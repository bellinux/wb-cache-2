5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{longevity}} of <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> <b>toads</b> in the wild, but some can live for many years. Skeletochronology is a method of examining bones to determine age. Using this method, the ages of mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa) were studied, the phalanges of the toes showing seasonal lines where growth slows in winter. The oldest frogs had ten bands, so their age was believed to be 14 years, including the four-year tadpole stage. Captive <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> <b>toads</b> have been recorded as living for up to 40 years, an age achieved by a European common toad (Bufo bufo). The cane toad (Bufo marinus) has been known to survive 24 years in captivity, and the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) 14 years. Frogs from temperate climates hibernate during the winter, and four species are known to be able to withstand freezing during this time, including the wood frog (Rana sylvatica).|$|E
5|$|Some <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> <b>toads</b> inflate {{themselves}} {{to make themselves}} look large and fierce, and some spadefoot toads (Pelobates spp) scream and leap towards the attacker. Giant salamanders of the genus Andrias, as well as Ceratophrine and Pyxicephalus frogs possess sharp teeth and are capable of drawing blood with a defensive bite. The blackbelly salamander (Desmognathus quadramaculatus) can bite an attacking common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) {{two or three times}} its size on the head and often manages to escape.|$|E
5|$|The {{common toad}} was first given the name Rana bufo by the Swedish {{biologist}} Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae in 1758. In this work, he placed all the <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> <b>toads</b> {{in the single}} genus Rana. It later became apparent that this genus should be divided, and in 1768, the Austrian naturalist Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti placed the common toad in the genus Bufo, naming it Bufo bufo. The toads in this genus {{are included in the}} family Bufonidae, the true toads.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Frog</b> <b>and</b> <b>Toad</b> Together (1972) [...] "Five more {{wise and}} {{wonderful}} stories to reaffirm the happy truth that <b>Frog</b> <b>and</b> <b>Toad</b> Are Friends." ...|$|R
50|$|The two friends, <b>Frog</b> <b>and</b> <b>Toad,</b> {{are portrayed}} {{by the author}} with human-like personalities and {{amphibian}} appearance. The situations in which they find themselves are a cross between the human and animal worlds. Along with Lobel's other <b>Frog</b> <b>and</b> <b>Toad</b> books, <b>Frog</b> <b>and</b> <b>Toad</b> All Year is valued by experts in children's literature for its portrayal {{of the value of}} friendship.|$|R
5|$|<b>Frogs</b> <b>and</b> <b>toads</b> are broadly {{classified}} into three suborders: Archaeobatrachia, which includes four families of primitive frogs; Mesobatrachia, which includes five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs; and Neobatrachia, {{by far the}} largest group, which contains the remaining 24 families of modern frogs, including most common species throughout the world. The Neobatrachia suborder is further divided into the two superfamilies Hyloidea and Ranoidea. This classification is based on such morphological features as the number of vertebrae, the structure of the pectoral girdle, and the morphology of tadpoles. While this classification is largely accepted, relationships among families of frogs are still debated.|$|E
5|$|In {{locations}} where both snake and salamander co-exist, the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they {{feed on the}} amphibians with impunity. Coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities {{at the same rate}} as the snake further develops its immunity. Some <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> <b>toads</b> are toxic, the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back. These regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul-tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms. Altogether, over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated.|$|E
5|$|The {{body plan}} {{of an adult}} frog is {{generally}} characterized by a stout body, protruding eyes, cleft tongue, limbs folded underneath, {{and the absence of}} a tail. Besides living in fresh water and on dry land, the adults of some species are adapted for living underground or in trees. The skins of frog are glandular, with secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic. Warty species of frog tend to be called toads but the distinction between <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> <b>toads</b> is based on informal naming conventions concentrating on the warts rather than taxonomy or evolutionary history. Frogs' skins vary in colour from well-camouflaged dappled brown, grey and green to vivid patterns of bright red or yellow and black to advertise toxicity and warn off predators.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the over}} 3400 species of frog and toad worldwide, the {{majority}} {{live in the}} tropics. However, Michigan's species live where it is often cold, necessitating adaptions to freezing weather due to their ectothermic (cold-blooded) nature. Most <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> <b>toads</b> become dormant in the winter; some frogs can withstand short periods of freezing conditions, {{but this is not}} true of all species. Some species of salamander also hibernate during the winter, while other fully aquatic species remain active throughout the year. Amphibians are vulnerable to many types of human encroachment, including water pollution, automobiles, the destruction of wetlands through farming and the use of off-road vehicles and chemical pesticides. In Michigan, wetlands protection legislation is in place to prevent pollution and destruction, while additional wetlands are being reclaimed and restored after agricultural usage has ceased.|$|E

Examples are <b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> <b>toads,</b> salamanders, newts and caecilians (which {{resemble}} snakes).

25|$|Temnospondyl {{affinity}} for the Lissamphibia is suggested by other works. The temnospondyl family Amphibamidae has been considered a possible candidate for the ancestors of lissamphibians. The amphibamid Gerobatrachus, described in 2008, was proposed to be a transitional form between temnospondyls and anurans (<b>frogs</b> <b>and</b> <b>toads)</b> and caudatans (salamanders). It possessed a mixture of anuran and caudatan features, including a broad skull, short tail, and small pedicellate teeth.|$|E
