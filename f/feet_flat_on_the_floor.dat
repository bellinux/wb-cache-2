2500|$|A dancer may {{transition}} to en pointe {{by any of}} three possible methods: relevé, sauté or piqué. In the relevé method, the dancer rises smoothly by rotating the foot downward until it reaches a fully extended, vertical orientation, while the toe box remains {{in contact with the}} floor, thus [...] "rolling up" [...] on the foot. This may be done either gradually or rapidly, on one foot or both feet, beginning with <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> or in demi-pointe (heels raised). In the sauté method, the dancer springs up and lands en pointe. In the process, the feet break contact with the floor and the dancer is briefly airborne. To {{transition to}} en pointe via piqué, a dancer will step out directly onto a fully extended, vertical foot. The other foot is then raised from the floor, thereby leaving the dancer en pointe.|$|E

Touch typing also involves the use of the home row method, where typists keep their wrists up, rather than resting them on a desk or keyboard (which can cause carpal tunnel syndrome). To avoid this, typists should sit up tall, leaning slightly forward from the waist, place their <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> in front of them with one foot slightly in front of the other, and keep their elbows close to their sides with forearms slanted slightly upward to the keyboard; fingers should be curved slightly and rest on the home row.|$|E
50|$|When {{measuring}} {{blood pressure}} in the home, an accurate reading requires that one not drink coffee, smoke cigarettes, or engage in strenuous exercise for 30 minutes before taking the reading. A full bladder may have a small effect on blood pressure readings; if the urge to urinate arises, one should do so before the reading. For 5 minutes before the reading, one should sit upright in a chair with one's <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and with limbs uncrossed. The blood pressure cuff should always be against bare skin, as readings taken over a shirt sleeve are less accurate. The same arm {{should be used for}} all measurements.

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether there is any {{difference}} between BP readings with patients crossing a leg at the knee level and uncrossing during BP measurement. Background: It is clear that numerous factors influence an individual's blood pressure (BP) measurement. However, guidelines for accurately measuring BP inconsistently specify that the patient should keep <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Design: Repeated measures. Method: Using a mercury-filled column sphygmomanometer, BP was measured at uncrossed leg position, crossed leg position and again at uncrossed leg position in 283 unmedicated or medicated patients. Three experienced nurses specially trained for the study performed BP measurements. Results: The results indicated that BP increased significantly with the crossed leg position. Systolic and diastolic BP significantly increased approximately 10 and 8 mmHg, respectively. Conclusion: Crossing the leg at knee results in a significant increase in BP. Relevance to clinical practice: Leg position during measurement of BP should be standardised and mentioned in publications. ...|$|E

[Purpose] The {{multi-directional}} reach test (MDRT) is a simple, inexpensive, {{reliable and}} valid screen-ing tool for assessing the limits of stability in the anterorposterior and mediolateral directions. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify the limits of stability of people aged between 20 and 79 years using the MDRT. [Subjects] One hundred and eighty subjects were divided into the following 6 age groups: 20 – 29, 30 – 39, 40 – 49, 50 – 59, 60 – 69 and 70 – 79 years (n= 30 per group). [Methods] The MDRT was used to measure the limits of stability in four directions: forward, backward, leftward and rightward. Subjects performed maximal outstretched arm reach in each direction with their <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> [Results] All age groups performed the greatest values of the limit of stability in the forward direction. The 60 – 79 year group demonstrated significantly lower limits of stability in the forward, left-ward and rightward directions compared to the 20 – 39 year group.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{establish}} {{whether the}} results of blood pressure (BP) measurements are affected by wearing clothing underneath the BP cuff during measurement. METHODS: Normotensive and hypertensive patients (n= 133; 65 men) of an outpatient clinic participated in this study. BP was measured according to a rigorous protocol with a validated oscillometric device under three conditions: with one layer of own clothing (OC) underneath the cuff, with one layer of standardized clothing (SC) underneath the cuff, and with the cuff on a bare arm (BA), in a randomized order. Patients were seated on a chair with their right arm {{on the table and}} their <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> during BP measurement. RESULTS: The mean BP values (+/-SEM) measured during BA, OC, and SC were, respectively, 132. 8 +/- 1. 3, 132. 3 +/- 1. 4, and 133. 2 +/- 1. 4 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP), 78. 3 +/- 0. 9, 78. 3 +/- 0. 9, and 78. 5 +/- 0. 9 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and 90. 3 +/- 1. 0, 90. 0 +/- 1. 0, and 91. 5 +/- 1. 0 mmHg for mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). The differences in SBP, DBP, and MAP between BA, OC, and SC measurements were not statistically significant, but there was considerable intraindividual variation in SBP deviations of more than 5 mmHg between BA versus OC and SC. There was no significant order effect of the three conditions. The absence of differences between BA, OC, and SC was not determined by age, sex, BMI, and arm circumference. CONCLUSION: We could not find differences in MAP, SBP, and DBP between the bare and clothed arms, but intraindividual variation of SBP between the three conditions is not negligible. Despite this caveat, these data suggest that in an outpatient clinic, BP can be measured reliably with one layer of clothing underneath the cuff. This is timesaving and more comfortable for patients...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focussed}} {{on three}} major issues: (1) can we develop a clinical tool to measure trunk performance which {{takes into account}} the assessment of selective trunk movements, evaluation of quality of trunk movement and is a valid instrument for measuring rehabilitation outcome? (2) What is the importance of trunk function in relation to motor and functional recovery after stroke? And (3) what is the pattern of recovery of the trunk and is it comparable to the pattern of recovery of arm, leg and functional activity after stroke? At the start of this doctoral study, there was a clear lack of clinical tools which assess trunk impairment after stroke. In the systematic review presented in chapter 1 we discussed three clinical tools which specifically evaluate trunk performance after stroke, the Trunk Control Test and two Trunk Impairment Scales. Psychometric properties of the three scales were compared. The most extensively appraised tools are the two Trunk Impairment Scales. It was established that the Trunk Impairment Scale developed in this doctoral study had sufficiently robust psychometric characteristics to make it a valuable assessment tool. Furthermore and contrary to the other two scales it has no ceiling effect. The Trunk Impairment Scale developed at the Department of Rehabilitation Sciences at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven is presented in chapter 2. The scale consists of three subscales: static and dynamic sitting balance and trunk co-ordination. Static sitting balance assesses if the patient can remain in the seated position {{at the side of the}} bed with the <b>feet</b> <b>flat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and if the patient can maintain this position when the legs are crossed passively by the therapist and actively by the patient. Dynamic sitting balance evaluates if the patient can selectively perform a lateral flexion, initiated from the upper and lower part of the trunk. Finally co-ordination examines if the patient can perform a selective rotation of the upper and lower part of the trunk. The score for the static, dynamic and co-ordination subscales range from 0 to 7, 10 and 6 points, respectively. The total score for the Trunk Impairment Scale ranges from 0 to 23 points, a higher score indicating a better trunk performance. Test-retest and interrater reliability were established. Kappa and weighted Kappa values, percentages agreement and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated on a sample of 28 stroke patients. ICC values for test-retest and interrater agreement for the total Trunk Impairment Scale score were 0. 96 and 0. 99. The 95 % limits of agreement for the test-retest and interexaminer measurement error were between - 2. 90 and 3. 68 and - 1. 84 and 1. 84, respectively. Furthermore internal consistency and content, construct and concurrent validity were established. It was concluded that the Trunk Impairment Scale has good clinimetric characteristics. The scale evaluates selective movements of the trunk, taking into account the quality of the trunk movement and is related to actual treatment of the trunk in stroke patients because of its established content validity. The study presented in chapter 3 answers the question if the items of the scale would be able to discriminate stroke patients from healthy individuals. Forty stroke patients and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were evaluated with the Trunk Impairment Scale. It was concluded that the Trunk Impairment Scale clearly discriminates between stroke patients and healthy individuals. Significant differences (p<. 0001) were found for the total Trunk Impairment Scale and its subscale scores between the two groups. Forty-five percent of the healthy individuals did not score the maximum value on the Trunk Impairment Scale. It was suggested that a score of 20 out of 23 could be considered as a borderline value to discriminate a normal from an impaired trunk performance. Chapter 4 and 5 present the psychometric properties of the Trunk Impairment Scale for patients with multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury. Intraclass correlation coefficients of 0. 95 and 0. 97 for the Trunk Impairment Scale and 0. 92 and 0. 93 for the trunk assessment of the Melsbroek Disability Scoring Test established test-retest and interrater reliability for both tests on a sample of 30 patients with MS. Bland Altman plots provided further evidence of consistency of scores over the full range without observer bias. It was concluded that both clinical tools have good clinimetric characteristics and are applicable for measuring trunk performance in persons with multiple sclerosis. Reliability and validity of the Trunk Impairment Scale was also established for patients with traumatic brain injury on a sample of 30 patients. ICC values of 0. 88 and 0. 95 were reported for test-retest and interrater reliability for the total Trunk Impairment Scale. The 95 % limits of agreement for test-retest and interexaminer measurement error were - 4, 4 and - 3, 3 respectively. A correlation coefficient between the Trunk Impairment Scale and the Barthel index of 0. 59 (p =. 0007) established construct validity. It was concluded that acceptable psychometric properties allows the use of the Trunk Impairment Scale in rehabilitation treatment and research for patients with traumatic brain injury. Chapter 6 presents the cross-sectional study which was performed to compare the Trunk Control Test with the Trunk Impairment Scale and to relate trunk function to measures of gait, balance and functional ability. Fifty-one non-acute and chronic stroke patients were evaluated. Measures of gait, balance and functional ability comprised the Tinetti balance and gait test, Functional Ambulation Category score, 10 -m walk test, timed Up and Go test and motor part of the Functional Independence Measure. This study demonstrated that the trunk is still impaired in non-acute and chronic stroke patients. Median score on the Trunk Control Test was 61 out of 100 (61 %) and 11 out of 23 (48 %) on the Trunk Impairment Scale. Twelve participants (24 %) obtained the maximum score for the Trunk Control Test, indicating an important ceiling effect in the examined population. No subject obtained the maximum score on the Trunk Impairment Scale. Multiple regression analysis emphasized the importance of trunk performance in relation to measures of balance, gait and functional ability (Model R² = 0. 55 to 0. 62). The predictive validity of the Trunk Impairment Scale was addressed in chapter 7. A total of 102 subjects were evaluated on admission to a rehabilitation centre and at six months after stroke. The study was conducted in three European rehabilitation centres and was part of the ‘Collaborative Evaluation of Rehabilitation of Stroke across Europe’ (CERISE) project. The impact of trunk performance on functional recovery after stroke was further revealed by the results of this study indicating that Trunk Impairment Scale total score (R² = 0. 52, p<. 0001) and static sitting balance subscale score on admission (R² = 0. 50, p<. 0001) were significant predictors of Barthel index score at six months after stroke. The total TIS and static sitting balance subscale score were better predictors of Barthel index score at six months than Barthel index score on admission itself. Having established that trunk performance as measured by the Trunk Impairment Scale was an important determining factor of the outcome of rehabilitation of stroke patients, chapter 8 focused on possible differences between trunk recovery patterns and that of distal parts and of functional ability. Measures of arm, leg, trunk and functional performance were assessed at one week, one month, three months and six months after stroke. Contrary to common belief, it was found that the recovery patterns for trunk, arm, leg and functional activity showed remarkable similarities. Furthermore, the results of the study revealed that patients after stroke improved significantly for all measures between one week an one month and between one month and three months after stroke with the most improvement noted from one week to one month after stroke. No significant difference was found between three and six months after stroke, indicating an important stagnation or ‘plateau phase’ and even a deterioration in motor and functional performance. status: publishe...|$|E
