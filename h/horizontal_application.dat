5000|$|While clearly envisaging direct <b>horizontal</b> <b>application</b> in {{applicable}} cases, the 1996 Bill of Rights {{also requires}} {{the courts to}} apply the Bill of Rights indirectly, in similar terms to section 35(3) of the interim Constitution.

50|$|The 1996 Bill of Rights {{goes further}} than is traditional, however. It {{recognises}} that “private abuse {{of human rights}} may be as pernicious as violations perpetrated by the state.” For this reason, the Bill of Rights {{is not confined to}} protecting individuals against the state. In certain circumstances, the Bill of Rights directly protects individuals against abuses of their rights by other individuals, by providing for the direct <b>horizontal</b> <b>application</b> of the Bill of Rights.|$|E

50|$|The direct {{application}} of the duties under the Bill of Rights is governed by section 8. Broadly speaking, section 8(1) deals with direct vertical application. It describes {{the circumstances in which}} law and conduct of the state may be challenged for being inconsistent with the Bill of Rights. Section 8(2), on the other hand, deals with direct <b>horizontal</b> <b>application.</b> It sets out the circumstances in which the conduct of private individuals may be attacked for infringing the Bill of Rights. Section 8(3) grants powers to the courts to remedy such infringements.|$|E
50|$|The view of Currie and De Waal is that Barkhuizen “largely renders s 8(2) nugatory.” The Constitution {{applies to}} all law and, {{in the case of}} the common law (“the courts’ own law”), the default {{approach}} of the courts is to assess its constitutionality and to develop it where necessary by way of the indirect application methodology set out below. “The only remaining reason” to deploy direct <b>horizontal</b> <b>application</b> would be to take advantage of the holding of the Supreme Court of Appeal in Afrox Healthcare v Strydom, to the effect that courts in direct-application cases are not bound by pre-1994 decisions.|$|E

The {{first was the}} addition of the word “judiciary” in section 8(1), missing from the application provisions of the interim Constitution. The second was the imposition of a duty on individuals, in section 8(2), to uphold the rights of other individuals: “A provision of the Bill of Rights binds a natural or a juristic person if, and to the extent that, it is applicable, taking into account the nature of the right and the nature of any duty imposed by the right.” ...|$|E

Before the 2001 changes, the standards allowed metal frames with single tinted glass along the coast and double tinted glass inland. With the changes, high performance fenestration is required by the prescriptive standards throughout California 1. The changes were implemented through an emergency rulemaking mandated by Assembly Bill 970 (Statutes of 2000). California law requires that the standards be cost effective when amortized over the building life. A rigorous life-cycle cost procedure considered the cost of modern fenestration technologies, associated energy savings, views, and typical glass area in buildings.

5000|$|The Afrox and Walters {{decisions}} have been strongly criticised. There is, however, “a significant omission from the Afrox decision.” As we have seen, indirect application in terms of section 39(2) does not involve only development of the common law, but also statutory interpretation, taking the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights into account. But the SCA in Afrox “seems to confine itself to the first type of indirect application only.” This may be taken to mean that “post-Afrox High Courts still possess the jurisdiction to depart from pre-constitutional statutory interpretations of the AD.” Currie and De Waal argue that “a great deal also turns on the distinction between direct and indirect application.” Khumalo v Holomisa appears to treat direct <b>horizontal</b> <b>application</b> as a relatively simple and unexceptional process. If so, “awkward appeal court precedent can easily be sidestepped. A High Court, by opting for direct application, will be understood to distinguish the case before it from a precedent arising from indirect application.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} a {{provision}} is an important consideration in determining whether it is applicable to private conduct or not. For example, {{the purpose of the}} right to leave the Republic is, in principle, to prevent the state from keeping persons captive in their own country. The right to reside anywhere in the Republic is aimed at preventing the state from reintroducing group areas-style legislation that divides the country into racial zones. “It follows,” write Currie and De Waal, “that these rights are not intended to have general <b>horizontal</b> <b>application.</b> On the other hand, the purpose of the right to human dignity does not necessarily demand differentiation between state and private conduct.” The right is to protect an individual against assault on his or her dignity from any source, whether private or public. The proper interpretation of a right in terms of its purpose may therefore sometimes result in a right’s not being applicable to private conduct, either generally or in a particular situation.|$|E
5000|$|Questions {{concerning}} the <b>horizontal</b> <b>application</b> of the Bill of Rights cannot be determined a priori {{and in the}} abstract. Although this is not explicitly stated, whether a provision of the Bill of Rights applies horizontally also depends {{on the nature of}} the private conduct in question and the circumstances of a particular case. This explains why section 8(2) states that a provision in the Bill of Rights binds a natural or juristic person if, and to the extent that, it is applicable. The extent to which a provision is applicable can only be determined by reference to the context within which it is sought to be relied upon. For example, the right of every arrested person to be informed promptly of the right to remain silent is of a nature that makes it generally inapplicable to private arrests. But there may be circumstances in which the right should apply to private arrests. There is no reason why a private security officer, who knows of the existence of the section-35(1)(a) right, or who may reasonably be expected to know of the right, should not observe it. Conversely, the right to assemble peacefully and unarmed generally applies on the horizontal level. The right to assemble in, for example, shopping malls and on the property of an employer is therefore guaranteed. In some circumstances, however, it may be inappropriate to apply the right horizontally. For example, “it is unlikely that the right to assemble can be relied on to justify demonstrations in or in front of someone’s private home.” However, a resort to context or the circumstances of a particular case “should not be used to frustrate the clear intention of the drafters of the 1996 Constitution” to extend the direct operation of the provisions of the Bill of Rights to private conduct: “It is not permissible to argue, for example, that it is only when private persons find themselves in a position comparable to the powerful state, that s 8(2) binds them to the Bill of Rights.” It may be that most private or juristic persons do not have the capacity to infringe human rights in a manner and on a scale comparable to the state, “but any interpretation of s 8(2) must avoid relying on such generalisations. The subsection was after all included to overcome the conventional assumption that human rights need only be protected in vertical relationships.” ...|$|E

In light of this, the article discusses mechanisms by which NSA who violate constitutional economic and social rights (ESR) may be held directly accountable by ESR-holders. Its central focus is the <b>horizontal</b> <b>application</b> of constitutional ESR protections to private relationships, where neither party has a state/public function or state nexus. The article reviews developments in two domestic constitutional systems, those of Ireland and South Africa, in order to demonstrate and explain the different approaches that have been adopted {{to the issue of}} horizontality by both the constitutional drafters and the courts in those jurisdictions.

These tests were conducted at the National Research Council of Canada in accordance with the CAN/ULC 2 ̆ 013 S 101 standard, which is similar in fire exposure to the ASTM E 119 fire resistance standard for updating the fire resistance ratings in the listed wall and floor assemblies in Part 9, Appendix A, of the National Building Codes of Canada. The results of tests were further analyzed to investigate the gypsum board fall-off for wall and floor assemblies. Four different approaches were investigated using the floor assemblies' test results to identify board fall-off criterion.

40|$|The {{twentieth century}} has been characterised by the {{proliferation}} {{of human rights in}} the discursive practices of the United Nations (Baxi, 1997). In this article, we explore the continual process of rights-based education towards transformative action, and an open and democratic society, as dependent upon the facilitation of human rights literacy in teacher training. Our theoretical framework examines the continual process of moving towards an open and democratic society through the facilitation of human rights literacy, rights-based education and transformative action. We focus specifically on understandings of dignity, equality and freedom, as both rights (legal claims) and values (moral action) across <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>applications,</b> considering the internalisation and implementation of dignity, equality and freedom towards transformative action. Our analysis of data stemming from a project funded by the National Research Foundation (NRF) entitled 'Human Rights Literacy: A quest for meaning', brought student-teachers' understandings into conversation with the proposed theoretical framework. In terms of understandings related to dignity, equality and freedom, participants seemingly understand human rights either as legal interests, or alternatively, as they pertain to values such as caring, ubuntu, respect, human dignity and equality. Legal understandings primarily focus on the vertical application of the Bill of Rights (RSA, 1996 a) and the role of government in this regard, whereas understandings related to the realisation of values tended to focus on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>applications</b> of particularly dignity and equality as the product of the relation between self and other. We conclude the article by linking the analysis and the theoretical framework to education as a humanising practice within human rights as a common language of humanity. In so doing, we argue that human rights literacy and rights-based education transcend knowledge about human rights, moving towards transformative action and caring educational relations premised on freedom, dignity and equality. Finally, recommendations are made regarding human rights and rights-based education as transformative action within the South African context, towards an open and democratic society...|$|R
40|$|The present chapter embeds the Dutch {{system of}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>application</b> of European {{fundamental}} rights in private {{law in the}} broader context of different groups (“families”) of European countries. Section 2 provides some definitions of “European fundamental rights”, “private law”, “vertical effect”, “direct horizontal effect” and “indirect horizontal effect”. Section 3 demonstrates that the horizontal effect of fundamental rights is a topic which challenges the traditional legal families taxonomies in comparative private law. Section 4 proposes a new taxonomy, specific {{to the analysis of}} the application of fundamental rights in private law in Europe. This new taxonomy consists in three legal families: (1) continental European countries whose governments had become totalitarian {{at some point in the}} 20 th century, (2) the UK and the Nordic countries, and (3) France and the Benelux countries. Section 5, 6, 7, 8 are specifically devoted to the Dutch system. Section 5 addresses the prohibition of constitutional review enshrined in Art. 120 of the Dutch Constitution, and explains that this norm has not prevented Dutch courts from applying constitutional rights horizontally. Section 6 discusses a milestone in the Dutch history of <b>horizontal</b> <b>application</b> of national and European fundamental rights: the Mensendieck case. This chapter thereby focuses on the profound divergence of approach between the Dutch Supreme Court in Mensendieck and the German Federal Constitutional Court in the Lüth judgment.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the ‘horizontal effect’ of European {{fundamental}} rights in the jurisprudence of the CJEU. It explores how the Court appies these rights in adjudicating litigations between private parties. It addresses three questions: (1) how the horizontal effect of fundamental rights operates, (2) which policy goals it serves, and (3) whether this use of fundamental rights is legitimate and desirable. The first section of this paper explains how the terms ‘European fundamental rights’ and ‘private law’ are used throughout the text, and outlines the difference between vertical and horizontal effect. The second section outlines the difference between direct and indirect horizontal effect of fundamental rights. In its third section, this paper takes position in favour of a normative individualistic understanding of fundamental rights. The fourth section makes some examples of direct <b>horizontal</b> <b>application</b> and the fifth section some examples of indirect <b>horizontal</b> <b>application</b> of fundamental rights in the CJEU jurisprudence. The sixth section analyses the horizontal effect of the Charter. Here, this paper proposes a new doctrine: the ‘double indirect horizontal effect’ of fundamental rights. This doctrine helps explain the impact of fundamental rights on private relationships in the European multi-level system of court adjudication. It also encourages the Court of Justice to develop its jurisprudence towards a better consideration of the non-economic human interests protected by European fundamental rights. The subsequent sections identify the policies related to the horizontal effect of fundamental rights at the EU level (seventh section). The eighth section addresses the question whether the pursuit of these policies through court adjudication constitutes a legitimate use or an illegitimate instrumentalization of fundamental rights. It assesses {{the extent to which}} both the above-mentioned national and European patterns of horizontal effect correspond to the normative individualistic perspective outlined in the fourth section.
