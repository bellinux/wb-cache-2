He addressed distraction and relief from reality through art and fantasy. Johnson used photos, video and site-specific installation to study escapist tendencies through often {{with a sense of}} <b>humor</b> <b>that</b> bordered on the absurd.|$|E
5|$|South Park is an American adult {{animated}} sitcom {{created by}} Trey Parker and Matt Stone and developed by Brian Graden for the Comedy Central television network. The show revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick—and their bizarre adventures {{in and around}} the titular Colorado town. Much like The Simpsons, South Park uses a very large ensemble cast of recurring characters and became infamous for its profanity and dark, surreal <b>humor</b> <b>that</b> satirizes a wide range of topics towards a mature audience.|$|E
5|$|Simakis {{praised the}} book for having more depth of {{character}} than Grisham's novels customarily do. She compares the protagonist to Mitch McDeere from The Firm and Rudy Baylor from The Rainmaker. Memmott says {{that most of the}} claimants that they find are unsympathetic, but a few are from somewhat sympathetic immigrant families. Simakis notes that Wally trades sex for legal services with one claimant. Harshaw says that the book is a bit sentimental and comparatively lacking in terms of secondary character development for Grisham. Larry Orenstein of Canada's Globe and Mail notes that on the dramatic scale this book has instances of laugh out loud <b>humor</b> <b>that</b> make it more like Boston Legal than The Practice, which Boston Legal was spun off from.|$|E

50|$|To me {{the most}} {{important}} requisite in a comic strip is real down-to-earth <b>humor.</b> <b>That's</b> 90 per cent of a strip; art ability makes up the other ten per cent. And to young cartoonists, I would like to say: keep plugging. You want to be ready when that fickle old lady, Opportunity, does knock.|$|R
5|$|Starting in 1999, a live {{production}} of Blue's Clues toured the U.S. to positive reviews. Johnson compared the show's audience participation {{with that of}} The Rocky Horror Picture Show. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances. The creators of the TV show were involved {{in all aspects of}} the live show, aiming to translate the bond between the TV show's audience and its cast to the stage and to provide young audiences with their first theatrical experience. The creators chose Jonathan Hochwald as the live show's producer, Gip Hoppe as its director, and Dave Gallo as its set designer. Neither Hoppe nor Gallo had any previous experience in children's theater. Nick Balaban and Michael Rubin, who wrote the music for the TV show, composed the live show's soundtrack. The producers were concerned with children's response to the host, who was played by Tom Mizer (a different actor than the host of the TV show), but his young audience enthusiastically accepted and embraced him. Actors were encouraged to improvise and respond to the audience, which resulted in changes throughout the show's run. The show's script included <b>humor</b> <b>that</b> both children and their parents could enjoy.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} chapter – Trial by Fire – the Hero enters {{the summer of}} his experience, facing more {{difficult}} challenges with more highly developed skills.

25|$|As Mayor of San Francisco, Brown {{was often}} portrayed mockingly but affectionately by {{political}} cartoonists and columnists as a vain emperor, presiding in a robe and crown over the inconsequential kingdom of San Francisco.

25|$|Keaton has {{had several}} romantic {{associations}} with noted entertainment industry personalities, starting with her {{time with the}} Broadway production of Play It Again, Sam when she auditioned for director Woody Allen. Their association became personal following a dinner after a late-night rehearsal. It was her sense of <b>humor</b> <b>that</b> attracted Allen. They briefly lived together during the Broadway production, {{but by the time}} of the film release of the same name in 1972, their living arrangements became informal. They worked together on eight films between 1971 and 1993, and Keaton has said that Allen remains one of her closest friends.|$|E
25|$|At age 17, in 1874, Veblen {{was sent}} to attend nearby Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. Early in his schooling, he {{demonstrated}} both the bitterness {{and the sense of}} <b>humor</b> <b>that</b> would characterize his later works. Veblen studied economics and philosophy under the guidance of the young John Bates Clark (1847–1938), who {{went on to become a}} leader in the new field of neoclassical economics. Clark’s influence on Veblen was great, and as Clark initiated him into the formal study of economics, Veblen came to recognize the nature and limitations of hypothetical economics that would begin to shape his theories. Veblen later developed an interest in the social sciences, taking courses within the fields of philosophy, natural history, and classical philology. Within the realm of philosophy, the works of Kant and Spencer were of greatest interest to him, inspiring several preconceptions of socio-economics. In contrast, his studies in natural history and classical philology shaped his formal use of the disciplines of science and language respectively.|$|E

500|$|For certain reviewers, {{the tone}} and style {{reinforced}} the novel's quality. In School Library Journal, Burns commented that Love Among the Walnuts [...] "is intentionally melodramatic, coincidental, improbable, and hilarious. The restrained, tongue-in-cheek tone heightens the humor of this spoof." [...] Kirkus Reviews compared {{the tone and}} plot of the story {{to that of a}} film directed by Preston Sturges or Frank Capra, describing how it [...] "has an unconventional style and offbeat sense of <b>humor</b> <b>that</b> will delight readers or exhaust them, depending on their tolerance for screwball comedies." [...] Nancy Hinkel, then Associate Editor at Alfred A. Knopf and Crown Books for Young Readers, wrote that the story has [...] "great writing, original ideas, and real style" [...] as well as [...] "a good dose of dry <b>humor</b> <b>that</b> slips past if you're not paying attention." [...] Helbig and Perkins described the novel's style as [...] "fast moving, engaging, and witty." ...|$|E

So as an actor, you can really play the intensity and gravity and seriousness of the moment, and just rely on the circumstances being funny.
