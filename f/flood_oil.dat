50|$|The Neversink River {{contains}} {{a large population}} of sea mussels and the richest diversity of freshwater mussels in the upper Delaware River Basin. However, {{one of the seven}} species of mussels found in the Neversink River, the dwarf wedgemussel, is on the federal list of endangered species. This situation was not being aided by the mussels being collected by the abandoned Cuddebackville Dam. The collection of mussel species near the dam was resulting in the Neversink River’s mussel population being primarily concentrated in one area, instead being well distributed throughout the river. Before the removal of the dam, not one dwarf wedgemussel could be found beyond the dam. This was making the mussels highly susceptible to extinction. A catastrophic <b>flood,</b> <b>oil</b> spill, chemical spill, or epidemic could have resulted in local extinction of the mussel populations in the Neversink River. The threat that the dam posed on the mussel life, particularly the Dwarf Wedge Mussel was one of the primary reasons for its removal.|$|E

Cambridge, the 1993 Daqing, Mellott Ranch, and the Wardlaw alkaline-surfacant-polymer floods were studied. An initial gel treatment followed by an alkaline-surfactant-polymer flood in the Wardlaw field would have been a benefit due to reduction of fracture flow.

40|$|Gelation {{technologies}} {{have been developed}} to provide more efficient vertical sweep efficiencies for flooding naturally fractured oil reservoirs or more efficient areal sweep efficiency for those with high permeability contrast ''thief zones''. The field proven alkaline-surfactant-polymer technology economically recovers 15 % to 25 % OOIP more oil than waterflooding from swept pore space of an oil reservoir. However, alkaline-surfactant-polymer technology is not amenable to naturally fractured reservoirs or those with thief zones because much of injected solution bypasses target pore space containing oil. This work investigates whether combining these two technologies could broaden applicability of alkaline-surfactant-polymer flooding into these reservoirs. A prior fluid-fluid report discussed interaction of different gel chemical compositions and alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions. Gel solutions under dynamic conditions of linear corefloods showed similar stability to alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions as in the fluid-fluid analyses. Aluminum-polyacrylamide, flowing gels are not stable to alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions of either pH 10. 5 or 12. 9. Chromium acetate-polyacrylamide flowing and rigid flowing gels are stable to subsequent alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution injection. Rigid flowing chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gels maintained permeability reduction better than flowing chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gels. Silicate-polyacrylamide gels are not stable with subsequent injection of either a pH 10. 5 or a 12. 9 alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution. Chromium acetate-xanthan gum rigid gels are not stable to subsequent alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution injection. Resorcinol-formaldehyde gels were stable to subsequent alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution injection. When evaluated in a dual core configuration, injected fluid flows into the core with the greatest effective permeability to the injected fluid. The same gel stability trends to subsequent alkaline-surfactant-polymer injected solution were observed. Aluminum citrate-polyacrylamide, resorcinol-formaldehyde, and the silicate-polyacrylamide gel systems did not produce significant incremental oil in linear corefloods. Both flowing and rigid flowing chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gels and the xanthan gum-chromium acetate gel system produced incremental oil with the rigid flowing gel producing the greatest amount. Higher oil recovery could have been due to higher differential pressures across cores. None of the gels tested appeared to alter alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution oil recovery. Total waterflood plus chemical <b>flood</b> <b>oil</b> recovery sequence recoveries were all similar. Chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gel used to seal fractured core maintain fracture closure if followed by an alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution. Chromium acetate gels that were stable to injection of alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions at 72 F were stable to injection of alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions at 125 F and 175 F in linear corefloods. Chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gels maintained diversion capability after injection of an alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution in stacked; radial coreflood with a common well bore. Xanthan gum-chromium acetate gels maintained gel integrity in linear corefloods after injection of an alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution at 125 F. At 175 F, Xanthan gum-chromium acetate gels were not stable either with or without subsequent alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution injection.

40|$|Thanks to {{the huge}} {{progress}} within the last 50 years in Earth Observation, Geospatial science and ICT technology, mankind is facing, for the first time, the opportunity to effectively respond to natural and artificial emergencies such as: earthquake, <b>flood,</b> <b>oil</b> spill, etc. Responding to an emergency requires to find, access, exchange, and of course understand many types of geospatial information provided by several types of sensors. Majors oil spills emergencies as, the Gulf of Mexico (Macondo/Deepwater Horizon) in 2010, {{the sinking of the}} oil tanker Prestige in 2002, have offered lessons learned and identified challenges to be addressed. Interoperability provides the principles and technologies to address those challenges. Since years interoperability has been developing based on traditional Service Oriented Architecture, request/response communication style, and implemented through Spatial Data Infrastructures. The experience handling oil spill responses shows that emergency services based on SDIs have some limitations, mainly due to their real-time peculiarity. Moreover despite the effort that Private Sector and Public Administration have been putting since years, the goal to provide an exhaustive picture of the situation during an Emergency Response is still far to be reached. We argue that to achieve this goal, we have to frame the problem in a different way.

Vibration-based diagnostics of <b>oil</b> <b>flooded</b> screw compressors allows us to estimate the deviation of their operation from the main mode in accordance with changing the settings of vibration processes. The <b>oil</b> <b>flooded</b> screw compressor transition from the main mode of operation to the abnormal one is accompanied by complex gas-dynamic phenomena i. e. the initial gaps and their decays. This leads to changes in the nature of vibration processes, prompting suggestions that there is a relationship to a change of vibration parameters and mode of compressor operation. Studies were conducted by combined method using an analytical calculation of the decay parameters of the initial discontinuity and an experimental one based on the measurement of acceleration on the body of the real <b>oil</b> <b>flooded</b> screw compressor. A virtually adequate reaction of the decay parameters of the initial gap and the peak values of vibration acceleration to the change of operation mode of <b>oil</b> <b>flooded</b> screw compressor has been received. The peak value of the vibration acceleration was selected by the method of Gating being time-coinciding with the beginning discharge phase of the <b>oil</b> <b>flooded</b> screw compressor, and therefore, with the decay time of the initial discontinuity. This indicates a large degree of hypothesis likelihood on an existing initial break in <b>oil</b> <b>flooded</b> screw compressor when operating in abnormal conditions.

40|$|A pilot {{carbon dioxide}} {{miscible}} flood was initiated in the Lansing Kansas City C {{formation in the}} Hall Gurney Field, Russell County, Kansas. The reservoir zone is an oomoldic carbonate located {{at a depth of}} about 2900 feet. The pilot consists of one carbon dioxide injection well and two production wells on about 10 acre spacing. Continuous carbon dioxide injection began on December 2, 2003. By the end of June 2005, 16. 19 MM lb of carbon dioxide were injected into the pilot area. Injection was converted to water on June 21, 2005 to reduce operating costs to a breakeven level with the expectation that sufficient carbon dioxide has been injected to displace the oil bank to the production wells by water injection. Wells in the pilot area produced 100 % water {{at the beginning of the}} <b>flood.</b> <b>Oil</b> production began in February 2004, increasing to an average of about 3. 78 B/D for the six month period between January 1 and June 30, 2005 before declining. By June 30, 2006, 41, 566 bbls of water were injected into CO 2 I- 1 and 2, 726 bbl of oil were produced from the pilot. Injection rates into CO 2 I- 1 declined with time, dropping to an unacceptable level for the project. The injection pressure was increased to reach a stable water injection rate of 100 B/D. However, the injection rate continued to decline with time, suggesting that water was being injected into a region with limited leakoff and production. Oil production rates remained in the range of 3 - 3. 5 B/D following conversion to water injection. Oil rates increased from about 3. 3 B/D for the period from January through March to about 4. 7 B/D for the period from April through June. If the oil rate is sustained, this may be the first indication of the arrival of the oil bank mobilized by carbon dioxide injection. A sustained fluid withdrawal rate of about 200 B/D from CO 2 No. 12 and CO 2 No. 13 appears to be necessary to obtain higher oil rates. There is no evidence that the oil bank generated by injection of carbon dioxide has reached either production well. Water injection will continue to displace oil mobilized by carbon dioxide to the production wells and to maintain the pressure in the PPV region at a level that supports continued miscible displacement as the carbon dioxide is displaced by the injected water...|$|E
40|$|A {{reservoir}} {{engineering and}} geologic {{study concluded that}} approximate 7, 852, 000 bbls of target oil exits in Poison Spider. Field pore volume, OOIP, and initial oil saturation are defined. Potential injection water has a total dissolved solids content of 1, 275 mg/L with no measurable divalent cations. If the Lakota water consistently has no measurable cations, the injection water does not require softening to dissolve alkali. Produced water total dissolved solids were 2, 835 mg/L and less than 20 mg/L hardness as the sum of divalent cations. Produced water requires softening to dissolve chemicals. Softened produced water was used to dissolve chemicals in these evaluations. Crude oil API gravity varies across the field from 19. 7 to 22. 2 degrees with a dead oil viscosity of 95 to 280 cp at 75 F. Interfacial tension reductions of up to 21, 025 fold (0. 001 dyne/cm) were developed with fifteen alkaline-surfactant combinations at some alkali concentration. An additional three alkaline-surfactant combinations reduced the interfacial tension greater than 5, 000 fold. NaOH generally produced the lowest interfacial tension values. Interfacial tension values of less than 0. 021 dyne/cm were maintained when the solutions were diluted with produced water to about 60 %. Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } when mixed with surfactants did not reduce interfacial tension values to levels at which incremental oil can be expected. NaOH without surfactant interfacial tension reduction is at a level where some additional oil might be recovered. Most of the alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions producing ultra low interfacial tension gave type II- phase behavior. Only two solutions produced type III phase behavior. Produced water dilution resulted in maintenance of phase type {{for a number of}} solutions at produced water dilutions exceeding 80 % dilution. The average loss of phase type occurred at 80 % dilution. Linear corefloods were performed to determine relative permeability end points, chemical-rock compatibility, polymer injectivity, dynamic chemical retention by rock, and recommended injected polymer concentration. Average initial oil saturation was 0. 796 Vp. Produced water injection recovered 53 % OOIP leaving an average residual oil saturation of 0. 375 Vp. Poison Spider rock was strongly water-wet with a mobility ratio for produced water displacing the 280 cp crude oil of 8. 6. Core was not sensitive to either alkali or surfactant injection. Injectivity increased 60 to 80 % with alkali plus surfactant injection. Low and medium molecular weight polyacrylamide polymers (Flopaam 3330 S and Flopaam 3430 S) dissolved in either an alkaline-surfactant solution or softened produced water injected and flowed through Poison Spider rock. Recommended injected polyacrylamide concentration is 2, 100 mg/L for both polymers for a unit mobility ratio.

40|$|Gelation {{technologies}} {{have been developed}} to provide more efficient vertical sweep efficiencies for flooding naturally fractured oil reservoirs or reservoirs with different sand lenses with high permeability contrast. The field proven alkaline-surfactant-polymer technology economically recovers 15 % to 25 % OOIP more crude oil than waterflooding froin swept pore space of an oil reservoir. However, alkaline-surfactant-polymer technology is not amenable to naturally fractured reservoirs or reservoirs with high permeability contrast zones because much of injected solution bypasses target pore space containing oil. This work investigates whether combining these two technologies could broaden applicability of alkaline-surfactant-polymer flooding into these reservoirs. Fluid-fluid interaction with different gel chemical compositions and alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution with pH values ranging from 9. 2 to 12. 9 have been tested. Aluminum-polyacrylamide gels are not stable to alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions at any pH. Chromium-polyacrylamide gels with polymer to chromium ion ratios of 25 or greater were stable to alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions if solution pH was 10. 6 or less. When the polymer to chromium ion was 15 or less, chromium-polyacrylamide gels were stable to alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions with pH values up to 12. 9. Chromium-xanthan gum gels were stable to alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions with pH values of 12. 9 at the polymer to chromium ion ratios tested. Silicate-polyacrylamide, resorcinol-formaldehyde, and sulfomethylated resorcinol-formaldehyde gels were also stable to alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions with pH values ranging from 9. 2 to 12. 9. Iron-polyacrylamide gels were immediately destroyed when contacted with any of the alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions with pH values ranging from 9. 2 to 12. 9. Gel solutions under dynamic conditions of linear corefloods showed similar stability to alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions as in the fluid-fluid analyses {{with the exception of the}} xanthan gum-chromium acetate gels. Aluminum-polyacrylamide flowing gels are not stable to alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions of either pH 10. 5 or 12. 9, either in linear corefloods or in dual separate radial core, common manifold corefloods. Chromium acetate-polyacrylamide flowing and rigid tonguing gels are stable to subsequent alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution injection. Rigid tonguing chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gels maintained permeability reduction better than flowing chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gels. Chromium acetate gels were stable to injection of alkaline-surfactant-polymer solutions at 72 F, 125 F and 175 F in linear corefloods. Chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gels maintained diversion capability after injection of an alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution in stacked; radial coreflood with a common well bore. Chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gel used to seal fractured core maintain fracture closure if followed by an alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution. Chromium acetate-xanthan gum rigid gels are not stable to subsequent alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution injection at 72, 125, and 175 F. Silicate-polyacrylamide gels are not stable with subsequent injection of either a pH 10. 5 or a 12. 9 alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution. Resorcinol-formaldehyde gels were stable to subsequent alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution injection. When evaluated in a dual core configuration, injected fluid flows into the core with the greatest effective permeability to the injected fluid. The same gel stability trends to subsequent alkaline-surfactant-polymer injected solution were observed. Aluminum citrate-polyacrylamide, resorcinol-formaldehyde, and the silicate-polyacrylamide gel systems did not produce significant incremental oil in linear corefloods. Both flowing and rigid tonguing chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gels and the xanthan gum-chromium acetate gel system produced incremental oil with the rigid tonguing gel producing the greatest amount. Higher oil recovery could have been due to higher differential pressures across cores. Aluminum citrate-polyacrylamide gels, chromium acetate-polyacrylamide gels, silicate-polymer, and chromium-xanthan guin gels did not alter an alkaline-surfactant-polymer solution's ability to produce incremental oil.

In Canada, optical and microwave remotely sensed images have been acquired from satellite and airborne platforms and {{have been used to}} monitor the progress of such events as <b>floods</b> and <b>oil</b> spills on a regional scale...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{complete}} description on the spectrum and eigenfunctions {{of the following}} two point boundary value problem (p(x) f') '-(q(x) -λ r(x)) f= 0, 0 0 and β_ 1 < 0, where neither self adjoint operator theorems on Hilbert spaces nor Sturm's comparison results can be used directly. We describe the spectrum and the oscillatory results of the eigenfunctions from a geometrical approach, using a function related to the Prüfer angle. The proofs of the asymptotic results of the eigenvalues and separation theorem of the eigenfunctions are developed through classical second order differential equation tools. Finally, the results on the spectrum of the equation are used {{for the study of}} the linear instability of a simple model for the fingering phenomenon on the <b>flooding</b> <b>oil</b> recovery process...|$|R
