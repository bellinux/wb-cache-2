The grain size has been illustrated for the upsetting of TC 6 alloy and the calculated grain size is in a good agreement with the experimental results, which shows that the microstructure prediction tool was validated and reliable. Then the distribution of stress, strain, temperature and microstructure, grain size and deformation has been predicted in TC 6 alloy blade forging successfully using the 3 D FEM at 930 ˚C deformation temperature, 250 ˚C die temperature and 50 mm/s deformation velocity. The {{results show that the}} temperature of blade edge is higher than that of center because heat transfer, friction work and deformation work.

The technology for producing hollow balls by metal forming technologies poses numerous difficulties connected with the forming of a hollow billet. The billet, which is usually in a form of a rod, is a subject to such processes as forging, helical rolling or cross-wedge rolling. The paper discusses a new method and conditions for producing a hollow ball. It was assumed that the ball would be produced in two forging operations: an initial <b>forging</b> operation and <b>finishing</b> <b>forging</b> operation. The presented results are based on the FEM numerical analysis conducted using DEFORM- 3 D. It was assumed that the billet material was made of AISI 304 stainless steel used to produce balls for ball valves.

50|$|Forged {{magnesium}} {{wheels are}} manufactured by mechanically deforming (forging) a prefabricated rod using a powerful forging press. Several somewhat different forging techniques exist, {{all of them}} comprising a multi-step process/operation. The resultant forging is subsequently machined (lathe-turned and milled) into the final shape of a wheel by removing excess metal from the forged blank. A forged magnesium wheel is 25 percent lighter than cast wheel. The main disadvantage of forged wheels is the high manufacturing cost. And due to the typically high costs of <b>finished</b> wheels, <b>forged</b> wheels are still rarely purchased by non-professional drivers for regular road use. But since forged wheels can be designed to be lighter than cast wheels for a given load, forged wheels do offer fuel economy and other distinct advantages. The forging process allows alignment of the metal fibers and optimization of the directional pattern arrangement along the spokes of a wheel. This, along with the smaller grain size, results in superior mechanical properties and performance characteristics that make forged magnesium wheels widely popular both for motor racing and with knowledgeable driving enthusiasts.|$|R

25|$|Forging is a {{manufacturing}} process involving {{the shaping of}} metal using localized compressive forces. The blows are delivered with a hammer (often a power hammer) or a die. Forging is often classified according to the temperature at which it is performed: cold forging (a type of cold working), warm forging, or hot forging (a type of hot working). For the latter two, the metal is heated, usually in a forge. Forged parts can range in weight from less than a kilogram to hundreds of metric tons. Forging {{has been done by}} smiths for millennia; the traditional products were kitchenware, hardware, hand tools, edged weapons, cymbals, and jewellery. Since the Industrial Revolution, forged parts are widely used in mechanisms and machines wherever a component requires high strength; such forgings usually require further processing (such as machining) to achieve a <b>finished</b> part. Today, <b>forging</b> is a major worldwide industry.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the industrial process of hot forging a flange. The authors developed several thermomechanical models of the forging process for which they carried out computer simulations using the MSC. Marc 2013 software. In the Jawor Forge flanges with a neck are manufactured by hot forging in crank presses with a maximum load of 25 MN. The input material, {{in the form of a}} square bar, is heated up to a temperature of 1150 °C and then formed in three operations: upsetting, preliminary die <b>forging</b> and <b>finishing</b> die <b>forging.</b> The main aim of the studies and the numerical analyses, in which the geometry of the tools would be modified, was to maximally reduce the amount of the input material taking into account the capabilities of the Jawor Forge, and consequently to significantly reduce the production costs. Besides the Forge’s equipment resources, the main constraint for modifications was the flange-with-neck forging standard which explicitely defines the tolerances for this element. The studies, which included numerical modelling, infrared measurements and technological tests, consisted in changing the geometry of the tools and that of the forging preform. As a result, the optimum direction for modifications aimed at reducing the mass of the input material was determined. The best of the solutions, making it possible to produce a correct forging in the Jawor Forge operating conditions, were adopted whereby the weight of the preform was reduced by 6. 11 %. Currently research is underway aimed at the application of the proposed and verified modifications to other flange forgings...|$|R
40|$|The Shroudless, Hollow Fan Blade Technology {{program was}} {{structured}} {{to support the}} design, fabrication, and subsequent evaluation of advanced hollow and shroudless blades for the Energy Efficient Engine fan component. Rockwell International was initially selected to produce hollow airfoil specimens employing the superplastic forming/diffusion bonding (SPF/DB) fabrication technique. Rockwell demonstrated that a titanium hollow structure could be fabricated utilizing SPF/DB manufacturing methods. However, some problems such as sharp internal cavity radii and unsatisfactory secondary bonding of the edge and root details prevented production of the required quantity of fatigue test specimens. Subsequently, TRW was selected to (1) produce hollow airfoil test specimens utilizing a laminate-core/hot isostatic press/diffusion bond approach, and (2) manufacture full-size hollow prototype fan blades utilizing the technology that evolved from the specimen fabrication effort. TRW established elements of blade design and defined laminate-core/hot isostatic press/diffusion bonding fabrication techniques to produce test specimens. This fabrication technology was utilized to produce full size hollow fan blades in which the HIP'ed parts were cambered/twisted/isothermally <b>forged,</b> <b>finish</b> machined, and delivered to Pratt & Whitney Aircraft and NASA for further evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{investigate}} the influence of plastic deformation and cooling conditions on a structure and a shape of CCT-diagrams of new-developed Nb-Ti-V microalloyed steel. Design/methodology/approach: The diagrams of undeformed and plastically-deformed supercooled austenite transformations for Nb-Ti-V microalloyed steel were determined. A part of the specimens were austenitized at a temperature of 885 °C and next cooled to ambient temperature with a various rate from 234 °C/s to 1 °C/min. To investigate the influence of plastic deformation on a shape of CCT (Continuous Cooling Transformations) diagrams, {{another part of the}} specimens were 50 % deformed at 885 °C or 1100 °C and cooled to ambient temperature with a rate from 95 °C/s to 1 °C/min. The DIL 805 A/D dilatometer, with a LVDT-type measuring head, was used to carry out dilatometric test. Findings: Performed dilatometric research revealed that the steel is characterized with Ac 3 = 843 °C, Ac 1 = 707 °C and a relatively low Ms temperature equal 370 °C. Plastic deformation of steel at the temperature of 885 °C {{prior to the start of}} phase transformations results in distinct acceleration of pearlitic transformation and slight translation of bainitic transformation towards shorter times. Research limitations/implications: Elaborated curves of supercooled austenite transformations of studied steel fully predispose it to production of forgings quenched directly from <b>forging</b> <b>finish</b> temperature and successively subjected to high temperature tempering. Practical implications: The obtained CCT diagrams of supercooled plastically-deformed austenite transformations can be useful in determination of cooling condition of the thermo-mechanical processing for high strength forged machine parts obtained from microalloyed steels. Originality/value: The diagrams of the plastically-deformed supercooled austenite for a new-developed microalloyed steel were obtained...|$|R
40|$|Multilayer Flood-welding {{repair of}} hot forging dies {{is a very}} useful {{technique}} which can remarkably enhance the working life of the die. Conventional quenched and tempered dies do not exhibit good resistance to wear. Therefore, these dies are nitrided to improve wear resistance but after the production of few numbers of forgings cracks are produced. Thatâ€™s why here multilayer flood-welding technique has been adapted to improve the die life and to establish the optimum parameters for this technique. In the current work, the modified H 12 hot-work tool steel was weld deposited in the cavity of hot-forging dies and their performance was monitored visually for the die condition and with the macroscopic and microscopic examination. It was analyzed that the thicknesses of the both hard upper â€˜capping layerâ€™ and intermediate â€˜buffer layerâ€™ have a prominent influence on the performance and the life hot forging die. For a particular dimensions and contour of the die impression, there came out an optimal thickness of the capping layer that provided the best performance. Further increase in capping layers thickness exhibited brittle cracking, whereas thinner capping layers produced early wear and plastic deformation. For intermediate buffer layer, {{in order to provide}} adequate backup support to capping layer, a certain minimum thickness level is required. This process minimized the die steel consumption because the thickness of the forging die is not reduced in the process of reworking and ultimately the process is cost effective. Moreover, the Multilayered flood-welded dies were gas nitrided to further enhance the life of the forging die. The results have shown that double stage nitriding process is good for these dies which produced minimum compound layer on the nitrided surface. The die life as a result of nitriding was amazingly increased compared to normal Multilayered flood-welded dies. The dies showed very slow wear and thermal fatigue cracking after the production of large number of forgings. By employing these dies excellent overall surface <b>finish</b> of the <b>forged</b> parts was achieved...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} two computer {{packages to}} simulate the rotary forging process, {{by means of a}} mathematical model. The results are displayed in a graphical and numerical manner, showing the tool movement and the tool / workpiece interaction. The first package, PATH, is shown to be capable of simulating the motions of all known rotary forging systems. Its results show the rotary forging tool path throughout a chosen process. The motions of any rotary forging system can be programed by a simple set of instructions displayed on the screen, and the results displayed quickly and graphically. The widely used motions of rocking - die rotary forging machines were investigated. From these investigations, formulae were put forward, which were shown to be capable of predicting the tool motion of any rocking - die rotary forging situation. The second package, PROFS, presents a meshed representation of the tools and workpieces used in rotary forging systems. The rotary forging tool is represented as a conic wire frame mesh, on which no forces or loads are considered to act. The workpiece is represented as a cylinder constructed from a number of hexahedral elements. The elements are treated in either a non - constant volume or a constant volume manner. The non - constant volume model workpiece is one which is simply cut away by the action of the tool on it. This model is similar to a process of 'rotary cutting'. Using the model, a technique of investigation into the progression of the contact geometries created during a real rotary forging, was developed. It enabled the progression and size of the contact geometry to be followed from start to <b>finish</b> of the <b>forging</b> cycle. No consideration of the loads or forces occurring during the process was taken into account. The constant model workpiece requires that its volume remains fixed during the simulation. This is achieved by a radial expansion of the elements of the workpiece as it is being 'deformed' by the tool. Again no consideration of the loads or forces occurring in rotary forging was taken into account. Investigations, using the model, enabled the instantaneous contact geometries, contact areas, and displaced volumes of material to be predicted during two real rotary forging processes. Results revealed the potential of PROFS, to determine areas of workpiece instability {{in the early stages of}} forging, and reveal ares of insufficient die fill. The potential of data from the simulations, to control a rotary forging machine, is discussed, and is seen as the first step towards the design and manufacture of rotary forging parts and dies by a C. A. D. - C. A. M. route. Contact areas produced during the rotary forging process are essential for any calculations of the forces and stresses occurring in the die and workpiece. The possibility of PROFS to be used as a die / design tool and in pre production trials for new parts is discussed. A physical simulation of a non - constant volume model workpiece was carried out using a 'short lead milling' technique to cut away a solid workpiece. This revealed the instantaneous contact geometries and areas of the workpiece, which were shown to be accurately predicted by PROFS using the non - constant volume. The results confirmed the accuracy and validity of the simulated instantaneous geometries, allowing a large degree of confidence to be assumed in the accuracy of the package. A data base of radial, circumferential, and custom die profiles has been built up and incorporated into PROFS. From the data base a chosen profile can be used to generate a conic meshed representation of a rotary forging die. Investigations, using a die generated from a custom profile, revealed areas of possible workpiece instability. The two packages put forward in this thesis have been shown to be capable of simulating the motions and contact geometries of the rotary forging process, and confirmed using physical and real rotary forging comparisons...|$|R
