The next parts were the engine and transmission components. The final part for lorries was a pre-assembled cabin. Conventional bus chassis were delivered with bonnet and wings, but the forward control types left the factory without any body parts. After being painted, the vehicles left the assembly hall. Finally, every vehicle was tested on a -long test run on different roads and with various loads. The bus chassis were tested in a similar way; because there was no body, the drivers only had warm clothes and driving goggles to protect them against the weather conditions. The vehicles were handed over to the customers after <b>final</b> <b>adjustments.</b>|$|E

25|$|During the dermal closure, the nipple-areola {{complex is}} {{transposed}} {{to its new}} locale, {{as determined by the}} skin pedicle. To create the curvilinear scar, the deep dermal closure is accomplished by rotating the lateral flap down and then medially. The deep dermis is approximated (joined) with sutures, in a simple, interrupted fashion. The key suture is emplaced at the junction where the apex of the vertical incision meets the nipple-areola complex—because it is the skin area of the breast subject to the greatest tension(s). The subcutaneous dermal closure is effected with interrupted sutures. As required, the <b>final</b> <b>adjustments</b> before suturing the skin closed, might include either micro-liposuction or additional de-epithelialization. After the dermal closure, a suture is emplaced to achieve the continuous approximation of the nipple-areola complex to the adjacent skin edge, and to the lower skin incisions.|$|E

She consequently sailed to Danzig, arriving about 23 May, proceeding immediately to Königsberg, where she put into the Schichau shipyard for a few days for minor repairs. She then sailed to Gotenhafen (Gdnyia, Poland), where she spent about five days in torpedo firing exercises, and then to Hela (now Hel, Poland) for the Ausbildungsgruppe Front ("Training Group Front") technical and dive training, which lasted about four weeks. U-353 returned to Rönne for a week of silent running tests, then arrived back at Flensburg for <b>final</b> <b>adjustments</b> and crew leave on 11 July.

At the Canadian Grand Prix tweaks were also made to the flip-up flaps in front of the rear wheels, to reduce drag. For the Italian Grand Prix, at the low-downforce Monza circuit, Williams tweaked the design of the FW30's bodywork, and front and rear wings. Sporting only a single element, with its outer edges turned upward, the rear wing was designed to reduce drag on Monza's long, fast straights, while still providing sufficient downforce during cornering. <b>Final</b> <b>adjustments</b> were made to the FW30's rear aerodynamics prior to the Brazilian Grand Prix. Here, the small winglets in front of the rear wheels were augmented by the addition of a small flap beneath their main elements, in order to better deflect airflow around the wheels and reduce the aerodynamic disruption caused by the wheels' rotation.|$|E

500|$|Enemy creatures {{were taken}} from the various mythologies the team drew from, and their designs {{inspired}} by the stop-motion work of Ray Harryhausen. Sheidow valued the chance of working with mystical creatures, as his previous work had been limited to stock fantasy monsters from the Dungeons & Dragons universe. According to him, the process started when the chosen enemy monsters were given initial designs by lead concept artist Rich Sullivan. Each design was reviewed, and the most suitable was chosen. Creature designs needed to incorporate design choices from the game, such as the monsters' environments and individual fighting styles. They also needed to consider how much detail to put into character models depending on their relative position to the camera at any given time. When it reached the modelling stage, the monster designs were further refined to work within the restrictions of the game, then it was sent to the art time again for <b>final</b> <b>adjustments</b> and mapping of unique animations. The particle effects were handled by Travis Doggett: one of the more prominent pieces of his work were the mastery skills, which had particular themes related to their abilities. According to animator Brian Labore, model animation proved a taxing task, as there were over eighty different monsters which ranged from typical mythical beings to more exotic and unique enemies from each region. The player character also had [...] "hundreds" [...] of animations to incorporate.|$|E

500|$|New Jersey elected {{its first}} {{lieutenant}} governor in 2009. [...] After the primary election in June 2009, Governor Corzine {{signed into law}} A.3902, a bill from the state legislature that sought to clarify a vague passage in the state constitution concerning a gubernatorial candidate's selection of a running mate. [...] Corzine signed the bill into law on June 25, 2009. [...] The constitution provided that a gubernatorial candidate select a running mate within 30 days after the [...] "nomination." [...] The confusion that arose concerned whether the [...] "nomination" [...] was {{the date of the}} primary election or the date that the vote count of that election was confirmed as final and certified by the state's Secretary of State. [...] As defined by state law, the primary election is held on [...] "Tuesday after the first Monday in June". [...] However, the reported winner of a primary election is not official until the state's 21 county clerks are canvassed for official results after an election. [...] This allows time for the Secretary of State to tabulate stray late absentee ballots (i.e. from military voters stationed outside the state); calculate <b>final</b> <b>adjustments</b> of vote tallies; litigate legal disputes; and conduct recounts if necessary. A.3902 provided a clarification of this deadline as [...] "30 days after primary results are certified by the secretary of state, not the primary election itself." [...] The bill also reduced the number of days in which the June primary election results must be certified from 86 days (which would place the deadline in August) to the fourth Friday in June, less than 4 weeks after the election. [...] By enacting this bill, New Jersey's gubernatorial candidates had an extra three-and-a-half weeks to announce their selection of a lieutenant governor running mate. [...] The 2009 deadline for such an announcement was moved from July 2 (30 days after the primary election) to July 27 (30 days after the certification of election results).|$|E

2500|$|Morris (1965) {{holds that}} in the fluid situation, the {{commanding}} Zulu generals struggled to shape the battle and position their forces in the proper order as the warriors streamed forward, but only succeeded in holding back one corps (the Undi), and one regiment (the uDloko) which had been located a mile behind the main body. McBride (1976) maintains that the Zulu commanders were already well informed by their scouts (izinhloli) of British dispositions and their preliminary positioning and the classic battle deployment would shape the resulting battle, with the right horn circling the mountain to attack from the rear, the felt horn pinning the redcoats in place and cutting them off, the chest delivering the main blow, and the [...] "loins" [...] held back in reserve from the initial rush.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} unimanual and bimanual prehension {{in people}} with an incomplete cervical Spinal Cord Injury (icSCI) when compared to non-injured younger adults (YA) and older adults (OA). Quantifying control changes following icSCI will help to guide rehabilitation to improve arm and hand function, which is the main priority for rehabilitation following injury to the cervical spinal cord. Using 3 D kinematic and surface EMG analysis, eighteen participants with an icSCI, sixteen YA and sixteen OA were examined, in three studies, when reaching and grasping objects, varying in distance and size, in unimanual and bimanual conditions. Kinematic data showed that participants with an icSCI produced unimanual and bimanual movements of a longer duration and lower peak velocity, with an increased reliance on the deceleration and <b>final</b> <b>adjustment</b> phase when compared to non-injured participants. With regards to the grasp phase, participants with an icSCI produced maximum grasp aperture earlier in the movement and with temporal dissociation between the transport and grasp phases. Participants with an icSCI also showed novel muscle activity patterns when compared to non-injured participants, suggesting that neuroplasticity of spared fibres had occurred in the acute stages of the injury. Object distance and object size influenced both the transport and grasp phases of unimanual and bimanual prehension, resulting in control differences between participants with an icSCI and non-injured participants e. g. longer movement time and increased reliance on the <b>final</b> <b>adjustment</b> phase when reaching to large objects. Despite bilateral deficits of the arms and hands, participants with an icSCI showed evidence for retaining a level of bimanual coordination, such as using the <b>final</b> <b>adjustment</b> phase to improve synchrony between the limbs. This supports the integration of bimanual movements into rehabilitation {{in order to improve}} arm and hand function, as well as the performance of activities of daily living, which are often bimanual in nature...|$|R
