50|$|The lens {{usually is}} focused by {{adjusting}} {{the distance from the}} lens assembly to the image plane, or by moving elements of the lens assembly. To improve performance, some lenses have a cam system that adjusts the distance between the groups as the lens is focused. Manufacturers call this different things: Nikon calls it CRC (close range correction); Canon calls it a floating system; and Hasselblad and Mamiya call it FLE (<b>floating</b> <b>lens</b> element).|$|E
5000|$|In Nikon and Canon's implementation, {{it works}} {{by using a}} <b>floating</b> <b>lens</b> element that is moved orthogonally to the optical axis of the lens using electromagnets. [...] Vibration is {{detected}} using two piezoelectric angular velocity sensors (often called gyroscopic sensors), one to detect horizontal movement {{and the other to}} detect vertical movement. As a result, this kind of image stabilizer corrects only for pitch and yaw axis rotations, and cannot correct for rotation around the optical axis. Some lenses have a secondary mode that counteracts vertical only camera shake. This mode is useful when using a panning technique, and switching into this mode depends on the lens; sometimes it is done by using a switch on the lens, or it can be automatic.|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} integral-floating display with 360 degree horizontal {{viewing angle}} is proposed. A lens array integrates two-dimensional elemental images projected by a digital micro-mirror device, reconstructing three-dimensional images. The three-dimensional images are then relayed to a mirror via double <b>floating</b> <b>lenses.</b> The mirror rotates in synchronization with the digital micro-mirror device {{to direct the}} relayed three-dimensional images to corresponding horizontal directions. By combining integral imaging and the rotating mirror scheme, the proposed method displays full-parallax three-dimensional images with 360 degree horizontal viewing angle...|$|R
5000|$|In 1990, the Coast Guard {{deactivated}} {{the light}} {{and replaced it with}} a nearby steel tower. Because of ongoing erosion of the bluffs, in 1993 the entire 2,000 ton structure was moved about 300 ft back from the cliffs. After the move, the Coast Guard decided not to retain the rotating mercury <b>float</b> <b>lens,</b> but instead installed the first order fixed lens which had been removed in 1980 from the Cape Lookout Lighthouse. [...] Ownership of the lighthouse was transferred in 1992 to the Southeast Lighthouse Foundation, which is dedicated to its preservation.|$|R
50|$|A {{zoom lens}} {{derivative}} of the Sonnar, the Vario-Sonnar also exists, {{in which a}} number of lens groups are replaced with <b>floating</b> pairs of <b>lens</b> groups.|$|R
50|$|The {{aperture}} control, {{usually a}} multi-leaf diaphragm, {{is critical to}} the performance of a lens. The role of the aperture is to control the amount of light passing through the lens to the film or sensor plane. An aperture placed outside of the lens, {{as in the case of}} some Victorian cameras, risks vignetting of the image in which the corners of the image are darker than the centre. A diaphragm too close to the image plane risks the diaphragm itself being recorded as a circular shape or at the very least causing diffraction patterns at small apertures. In most lens designs the aperture is positioned about midway between the front surface of the objective and the image plane. In some zoom lenses it is placed some distance away from the ideal location in order to accommodate the movement of <b>floating</b> <b>lens</b> elements needed to perform the zoom function.|$|E
30|$|To reduce {{motion blur}} {{resulting}} from camera shake, {{a large number}} of digital cameras with camera-shake reduction systems have been developed that can stabilize input images by shifting their optical systems mechanically. These image stabilization systems are categorized into two types according to the approach that is applied: the lens-shift approach, which shifts a <b>floating</b> <b>lens</b> to move the optical axis [11, 12] and the sensor-shift approach, which shifts the image sensor [13]. These image stabilizers can stabilize input images by controlling the optical path with a <b>floating</b> <b>lens</b> or the position of the image sensor with the camera’s internal sensors, such as its gyro sensor. The camera-shake reduction system is a camera-stabilization approach that uses the camera internal sensors for reducing motion blur resulting from camera shake; it is unsuitable for shooting blur-free images of fast moving scenes when the camera is fixed, because the internal sensors cannot detect any apparent motion in the captured images.|$|E
40|$|Akira Watanabe, Tamaki Gekka, Hiroshi Tsuneoka Department of Ophthalmology, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan Background: As {{a method}} of {{treatment}} for a dropped lens nucleus, which occurred during cataract surgery, the dropped lens nucleus was removed through the corneal wound without using pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). After vitrectomy, the dropped lens nucleus was floated on the perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL). The <b>floating</b> <b>lens</b> nucleus was then phacoemulsified and aspirated. During surgery, irrigation from the anterior chamber was performed. This method was very effective for treatment of a dropped hard nucleus. Case report: During cataract surgery on the left eye of an 80 -year-old woman, a posterior capsule rupture occurred. As a result, the lens nucleus dropped into the vitreous cavity. Irrigation to the anterior chamber was performed, with an anterior chamber maintainer inserted through a newly created side port at the corneal limbus. A vitreous cutter and a light guide were inserted in order to perform vitrectomy through the corneal incisions that were created for the cataract surgery. After vitrectomy, the dropped lens nucleus was floated using PFCL. The <b>floating</b> <b>lens</b> nucleus was removed by a bimanual phacoemulsification technique, with the anterior chamber irrigation continuing. The separation of the irrigation port and the aspiration port allowed for effective treatment of the dropped nucleus that was floating on the PFCL, even using a ­phacoemulsification machine with a peristaltic pump system. Safe and effective vitrectomy, similar to a PPV, could be performed with this method using three corneal ports. Conclusion: This technique may allow safer and more effective treatment for a dropped lens nucleus compared with conventional PPV. With this technique, corneal distortion due to surgical manipulation can lead to reduced visibility of the posterior eye.

40|$|The {{spreading}} {{coefficients of}} paraffin oil on nekal BX solutions have been {{determined by the}} <b>floating</b> <b>lens</b> technique of Langmuir. These measurements combined with the surface tension of the aqueous solutions give an exact idea of the wetting characteristics of the solutions. A rough measure of the wetting power is shown to be given by a measurement of the surface tension of the aqueous solution. It is shown that small quantities of nekal BX greatly improve the spreading qualities of oils on polar surfaces. The spreading coefficients of nekal BX solutions {{are found to be}} negative even at the highest concentrations tried. It is therefore suggested that the wetting takes place by penetration and not by spreading. Thus, the adhesion tension of the aqueous solutions against oil gives a more correct measure of the wetting power. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{vertical}} sinusoidal vibrations on a liquid droplet with a low surface tension (ethanol) deposited on a solid substrate. In a precise range of amplitudes and frequencies, the drop exhibits a dramatic worm-like shape instability with a strong symmetry breaking, comparable to the one observed by Pucci et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett., 106 (2011) 024503) on a vibrated <b>floating</b> <b>lens.</b> However, the geometry of our system is much simpler since it does not involve the oscillation and deformation of a liquid-liquid-air contact line. We show that the Faraday waves appearing {{on the surface of the}} droplet control its shape and we draw a systematic phase diagram of the instability. A simple theoretical model allows us to derive a relation between the elongation of the droplet and the amplitude of the Faraday wave, in good agreement with measurements of both quantities.

40|$|The {{cosmetic}} industry has witnessed significant growth in recent years. Conventional hand-held skin cameras allow for 2 D {{inspection of the}} skin surface. This paper proposes a new model for full-color 3 D imaging of the skin tissue using fiber-based optical coherence tomography (OCT). Compared to laser or LD sources, RGB LED was found more suitable and thus chosen in the low-coherence interferometry due to its wider bandwidth. A <b>floating</b> objective <b>lens</b> was used to confocalize the R, G and B imaging planes and to derive a full-color image of the capillary system in the skin tissue. The skin imaging system can be miniaturized {{to form a new}} hand-held model using an RGB integrated source, a micro-interferometer module and a high-speed beam steering device.

50|$|The {{original}} apparatus was supplied in 1833 by W. Hart of Launceston. He supplied six dozen Argand lamps with tin reflectors {{at three}} shillings and sixpence each. In 1835, the apparatus was upgraded by {{installation of a}} revolving shutter which was rotated by a weight-driven clockwork mechanism. In 1838, the original whale oil Argand lamps and the tin mirrors were replaced by a revolving catadioptric system, manufactured by Wilkins and Company of London. The <b>lens</b> <b>floated</b> and rotated in a mercury bath, which served as a bearing. The cost of these upgrades was £2000.

40|$|The current report {{describes}} {{the development of}} a computercode (RT 3 D-OW) which simulates the emission from a weathering multi-component oil phase and its subsequent fate of the dissolved contaminants in the groundwater. The widely used RT 3 D code was used as a starting point. New modules describing emission from both a continuous <b>floating</b> oil <b>lens</b> and discontinuous oil were added. Using Raoult’s law, it was possible to include the dissolution of a multi-component oil phase. The code is capable of simulating both weathering of an oil contamination in the subsurface and the time-dependant release of groundwater contaminants. In addition, the code includes existing features of RT 3 D such as biodegration, advection and dispersion. After implementation, the model was tested successfully at a well-characterised site in the USA and subsequently applied at two sites in The Netherlands. Simulated results on the Bemidji site (USA) indicate that the emissions from the characterised oil lens and even from the residual zone remain virtually constant. Based on a sensitivity analysis it is concluded that mass transfer from a continuous oil body is a slower process compared to mass transfer from residual oil and that the biodegradation rates of the individual oil components determine th...|$|R

50|$|The Crooked River Lighthouse, {{built in}} 1895, {{replaced}} three lighthouses on Dog Island {{that over the}} years were destroyed by storms.

After being electrified in 1933, the lighthouse was automated and unmanned in 1952. In 1964 the two houses and all outbuildings were sold and removed from the site.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{physical}} formulation, and a numerical algorithm, {{based on a}} class of general order parameters for simulating the motion of a mixture of N (N≥ 2) immiscible incompressible fluids with given densities, dynamic viscosities, and pairwise surface tensions. The introduction of general order parameters leads to a more strongly coupled system of phase field equations, in contrast to that with certain special choice of the order parameters. However, the general form enables one to compute the N-phase mixing energy density coefficients in an explicit fashion {{in terms of the}} pairwise surface tensions. From the simulation perspective, the increased complexity {{in the form of the}} phase field equations with general order parameters in actuality does not cause essential computational difficulties. Our numerical algorithm reformulates the (N- 1) strongly-coupled phase field equations for general order parameters into 2 (N- 1) Helmholtz-type equations that are completely de-coupled from one another, leading to a computational complexity essentially the same as that of the simpler phase field equations associated with special choice of order parameters. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method developed herein using several test problems involving multiple fluid phases and large contrasts in densities and viscosities among the multitude of fluids. In particular, by comparing simulation results with the Langmuir-de Gennes theory of <b>floating</b> liquid <b>lenses</b> we show that the method produces physically accurate results for multiple fluid phases.

30|$|The hydrogeological {{framework}} of Egypt {{is composed of}} several different aquifer systems. They differ in general characteristics, including extension, transmissivity, renewability etc. (Hefny et al. 1992). Along the Mediterranean coast, the fractured limestone aquifer systems of Middle Miocene rocks {{can be found in}} the littoral zones. Here, groundwater generally occurs under phreatic conditions in the form of thin <b>lenses</b> <b>floating</b> over saline water and recharged from rainwater. Specific conditions for the presence of a water table known as perched groundwater in this aquifer exist in the Fuka Basin at the northwestern coast of Egypt. Perched aquifers occur when groundwater collects above a low-permeability layer of rock or sediment above the main water table. Perched water may be defined as a saturated zone that is above or not directly connected to the static water table (Freeze and Cherry 1979). In other regions of the world, perched groundwater is also recorded, e.g., in Jordan in Biyar El Ghussein (Kimberley and Abu-Jaber 2005), in France in the Vosges Mountains (Sailhac et al. 2009), and in Nevada, USA, at Yucca Mountain (Wu et al. 1999).|$|R
40|$|The {{freshwater}} {{resources of}} coral atolls occur mainly as <b>lenses</b> <b>floating</b> on salt water underneath the islands. The {{size and shape}} of these lenses are determined by hydrogeologic characteristics, the rainfall recharge rate and its temporal variation, plus extractions (Underwood et al., 1992; Jones and Banner, 2003; Jocson et al., 2002). In the South Pacific, rainfall exhibits seasonal as well as interannual variability related to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Ropelewski and Halpert, 1987). We used electric conductivity measurements from pumped wells on Tongatapu to show a moderate ENSO control on the temporal fluctuation of the pumped freshwater salinity. The salinity dynamics depended on low or increased rainfall recharge during respectively dry El Nino periods or wet La Nina events. ENSO events cause a large variation around the mean salinity and determine the relative salinity over the time-scale of several years, while a smaller variation is introduced by seasonal rainfall.

40|$|Antifoams {{are widely}} used {{for control of the}} foam {{stability}} in various products (detergents, paints, pharmaceuticals, and many others). A significant progress in the understanding of the foam destruction mechanisms by oil-containing antifoams has been achieved recently. Experiments with antifoams comprising silicone oil and hydrophobic silica showed that the antifoam entities (emulsified globules or <b>lenses</b> <b>floating</b> on the solution surface) easily form unstable oil bridges between the two surfaces of the foam film. These bridges rapidly stretch in radial direction, due to uncompensated capillary pressures at the oil-water and oil-air interfaces, and eventually rupture the foam films. As a result, the foam is destroyed within several seconds by the mixed solid-liquid antifoams. In contrast, drops of silicone oil deprived of silica are unable to enter the foam film surface due to significant entry barriers. In these systems, the oil drops are expelled into the neighbouring Plateau borders (PBs), and the foam collapse is observed at a much later stage of the foam evolution, when the drops are compressed by the walls of the narrowing PBs (defoaming time on the order of minutes and hours). The magnitude of the entry barriers can be quantified by the so called Film Trappin...|$|R

In the last century, many events (land subsi- dence; land reclamation and drainage; urban and industrial development and gas and deep groundwater extractions; coastal dune destruction) led to the intrusion of large vol- umes of brackish and saline groundwater. Today the freshwater in this coastal aquifer con- sists of low salinity water <b>lenses</b> <b>floating</b> on the saltwater wedge. This study is aimed at understanding how past and present human activities have affected the saltwater intru- sion process in the phreatic aquifer and how the predicted future sea level rise will affect the salinisation process. We used a numerical model to quantify these effects on the den- sity-dependent groundwater flow, hydraulic head and salinity distribution, seepage and salt load fluxes to the surface water system. The simulations show that over the last cen- tury artificial subsidence and heavy drainage started the salinisation process in the study area and a relative sea level rise will accelerate the increase in salt load in the coming decades, affecting the entire aquifer. Climatic conditions in the area result in limited pre- cipitations throughout the year and preclude efficient aquifer recharge, especially in spring and summer when saltwater seepage is extensive.
