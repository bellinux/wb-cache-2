5000|$|The UK Payments Council from 30 June 2011 {{withdrew the}} {{existing}} Cheque <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Card</b> Scheme in the UK. [...] This service allowed cheques to be guaranteed at point of sales up {{to a certain}} value, normally £50 or £100, when signed in front of the retailer with the additional cheque <b>guarantee</b> <b>card.</b> This was after a long period of decline in their use in favour of debit cards.|$|E
50|$|Historically, bank cards {{have also}} served {{the purpose of}} a cheque <b>{{guarantee}}</b> <b>card,</b> a now almost defunct system to guarantee cheques at point of sale.|$|E
50|$|During the 1980 cheque <b>guarantee</b> <b>cards</b> {{were often}} {{combined}} with ATM cards for convenience. Usage of cheque guarantee system declined significantly during the 1990s {{with the introduction}} of debit cards.|$|R
50|$|After the {{introduction}} of debit cards there was a rapid decline {{in the use of}} cheque <b>guarantee</b> <b>cards</b> and these facilities were generally phased out in the countries that operated them during the 2000s. The Irish cheque guarantee scheme officially ended on 31 December 2011, ending the last such scheme in existence.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the select}} committee, Ruffley has opposed the Payments Council's plans to {{withdraw}} personal cheques by 2018, {{saying that it}} 'scared the pants off Middle England', accusing the Council of 'rank incompetence', and calling for the Council's chairman to resign. [...] He has also criticised the withdrawal of cheque <b>guarantee</b> <b>cards</b> in July 2011, saying that the public were not given sufficient warning.|$|R
5000|$|UBA is {{the first}} Nigerian Bank to {{introduce}} a Cheque Guarantee Scheme - the first cheque <b>guarantee</b> <b>card</b> {{in the history of}} innovative banking services by any Bank in Nigeria, known as UBACARD in 1986.|$|E
50|$|Eurocheques were {{particularly}} popular in German-speaking countries, {{where they were}} often issued as standard domestic cheques. They usually had {{to be accompanied by}} a cheque <b>guarantee</b> <b>card</b> in order to be accepted in payment at a point of sale. The Eurocheque <b>guarantee</b> <b>card</b> also had the functionality of an ATM card. In some countries, such as Austria and Germany, virtually all Eurocheque cards were co-branded with the logo of the respective domestic debit card system and were actually debit cards. After its phase-out, virtually all of these Eurocheque cards were replaced by Maestro cards. Therefore, Maestro is very often considered to be the successor to the Eurocheque system.|$|E
50|$|The {{first major}} move of the Payments Council, in 2009, was {{to agree to}} a target of 2018 for the closure of cheque {{clearing}} in the UK. It also announced that the cheque <b>guarantee</b> <b>card</b> scheme would end in June 2011.|$|E
50|$|Originally, German banks {{formed an}} interbank network {{connecting}} virtually all German ATMs. The network used Eurocheque <b>guarantee</b> <b>cards</b> as ATM cards {{and did not}} have a name or trademark of its own. In 1991, the electronic cash debit card service was introduced using the same cards, replacing the Geldkarte ATM and POS scheme on the territory of East Germany. The cards used for all three payment methods were simply known as Eurocheque card (German Euroscheck-Karte).|$|R
50|$|In 1969 cheque <b>guarantee</b> <b>cards</b> were {{introduced}} in several countries, allowing a retailer to confirm that a cheque would be honoured when used at a point of sale. The drawer would sign the cheque {{in front of the}} retailer, who would compare the signature to the signature on the card and then write the cheque-guarantee-card number {{on the back of the}} cheque. Such cards were generally phased out and replaced by debit cards, starting in the mid-1990s.|$|R
50|$|Barclays {{were the}} only major British {{clearing}} bank not to issue cheque <b>guarantee</b> <b>cards,</b> instead allowing its customers to guarantee cheques with their Barclaycard (on the basis that if a customer was creditworthy for a Barclaycard they were also good for issuing cheques). This practice ended in 1985, {{with the introduction of}} relaxed lending rules, and the introduction of the debit card Barclays Connect, however, it was still possible to guarantee Barclays Bank cheques using a Barclaycard well into the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|As of 2010, {{there were}} 1.4 million valid cheque {{guarantee}} cards in Ireland; however, just 45% of debit cards and 39% of ATM cards held the cheque guarantee function. The Irish cheque guarantee scheme covered sums {{of up to}} €130 per cheque. In 2010, the average value of a written cheque was €5,000, and only 1.5% of all cheques were {{used in conjunction with}} a <b>guarantee</b> <b>card.</b> Between 2007 and 2010, cheque usage decreased by 30%. In lights of these statistics, the Irish Paper Clearing Company announced in December 2010 that Ireland cheque <b>guarantee</b> <b>card</b> scheme would cease on 31 December 2011 thus bringing the last such scheme in the world to an end.|$|E
5000|$|Debit cards {{can also}} allow instant {{withdrawal}} of cash, {{acting as the}} ATM card, and as a cheque <b>guarantee</b> <b>card.</b> Merchants can also offer [...] "cashback"/"cashout" [...] facilities to customers, where a customer can withdraw cash along with their purchase. Merchants usually do not charge a fee for purchases by debit card.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, {{with the}} {{abolition}} of Eurocheques in Germany and other European countries, the cheque guarantee system also ended in those countries and many retailers stopped accepting cheques altogether. In 2011 {{after many years of}} decline, the Payments Council ended the UK cheque guarantee system, leaving Ireland as the last country to still operate a cheque <b>guarantee</b> <b>card</b> scheme.|$|E
5000|$|An {{identification}} card issued by a retailer allowing the holder to tender payment by check. Such cards were commonly issued in the United States by supermarkets and other retailers before {{the widespread use}} of debit cards. In Ireland and the United Kingdom, such cards were known as cheque <b>guarantee</b> <b>cards.</b> In the United States, the term check card was first coined by H. Robert Heller, then the President of VISA Inc. to indicate to users that it could be used just like a check.|$|R
50|$|In the US, {{federal law}} limits the {{liability}} of card holders to $50 {{in the event}} of theft of the actual credit card, regardless of the amount charged on the card, if reported within 60 days of receiving the statement. In practice many issuers will waive this small payment and simply remove the fraudulent charges from the customer's account if the customer signs an affidavit confirming that the charges are indeed fraudulent. If the physical card is not lost or stolen, but rather just the credit card account number itself is stolen, then Federal Law <b>guarantees</b> <b>card</b> holders have zero liability to the credit card issuer.|$|R
50|$|The forcing {{next step}} {{variation}} (discussed below) overcomes these problems by allowing opener {{to show a}} balanced hand, or any second suit and <b>guarantee</b> four <b>cards</b> in it, yet still offer the option of playing {{in two of the}} major.|$|R
50|$|Laser was {{launched}} by the Irish banks in 1996 {{as an extension of}} the existing ATM and Cheque <b>guarantee</b> <b>card</b> systems that had existed for many years. When the service was added, it became possible to make payments with a multifunctional card that combined ATM, cheque and debit card and international ATM facilities through MasterCard Cirrus or Visa Plus and sometimes the British Link ATM system. Their functionality was similar to the British Switch card.|$|E
50|$|A cheque <b>guarantee</b> <b>card</b> was {{essentially}} an abbreviated portable {{letter of credit}} granted by a bank to a qualified depositor {{in the form of}} a plastic card that was used in conjunction with a cheque. This allowed retailers to accept cheques and providing that the retailer wrote the card number on the back of the cheque, it was signed in the retailer's presence, and the retailer verified the signature on the cheque against the signature on the card, then the cheque could not be stopped and payment could not be refused by the bank. This arrangement worked only for cheques drawn on an account provided by the bank that issued the card and could result in an overdraft with penalty interest.|$|E
5000|$|In Ireland, Laser, {{which was}} co-branded with Maestro, has been {{replaced}} by Visa Debit and Debit MasterCard. The Laser debit card has been phased out by all banks and ceased to operate from March 2014. Irish Laser cards carried Maestro co-branding from 2008 onwards. They were intended to be used with chip and PIN POS systems. The chip on the card was programmed with two applications, one for Laser and one for Maestro. POS transactions were normally processed over the Laser network in Ireland and the Maestro network when the card was used abroad. Some POS terminals prompted users to manually select Laser or Maestro before completing the transaction. Laser cards could be processed as Maestro in most POS terminals worldwide for chip and PIN or swipe and sign transactions (where still accepted). Internet and telephone-based retailers, however, needed to be set up specifically to accept Irish Laser/Maestro cards. Transactions made with these cards were often secured by MasterCard's SecureCode system to verify the cardholder's identity. These cards were usually multi-functional and operated as a debit card as well as an ATM Card which could be used for accessing ATMs. Some banks also allowed customers to use their cards to deposit or withdraw money over the counter or at An Post post offices using their debit card and PIN. Historically the cards often contained a Cheque <b>guarantee</b> <b>card</b> function indicated by a hologram. This scheme was shut down in 2011. Foreign-issued Maestro cards are still accepted in Ireland in ATMs and by many POS machines. However, acceptance of Visa and MasterCard debit/credit cards is more reliably universal at POS terminals.|$|E

It offers {{a full range of}} financial products, including conventional products: account management, investments, savings, loans, bank <b>guarantees,</b> bank <b>card</b> services, custody management, treasury, project financing, Private Banking services etc., as well as investment fund management, leasing, securities trading, factoring, life and pension insurance. These latter services are offered through subsidiaries.|$|R
50|$|Some {{variations}} {{allow for}} multiple farmer's hands {{to be called}} out, but those exchanging cards with those {{left behind in the}} kitty after the first exchange are essentially <b>guaranteed</b> very poor <b>cards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Players {{must also}} select a Chamber card, and this then restricts what other cards {{can go into}} the deck. Chamber cards have certain trait symbols on them, and any cards put into the play deck must match {{at least one of}} these trait symbols. This <b>guarantees</b> that <b>cards</b> are {{compatible}} in terms of powers. Cards which don't have any trait symbols can be used in any deck.|$|R

50|$|On Europe's second-tier tour in 2007, Lorenzo-Vera had {{recorded}} eight top-ten finishes {{going into the}} last event, the Apulia San Domenico Grand Final, and was 7th on the Challenge Tour's money list. He set a new course record in the first round, {{and went on to}} win the tournament, which catapulted him to the top of the end of season Challenge Tour Rankings, and <b>guaranteed</b> his <b>card</b> on the top level European Tour for 2008.|$|R
50|$|An {{acceptance}} mark is however not {{an absolute}} <b>guarantee</b> that all <b>cards</b> {{belonging to a}} given card scheme will be accepted. On occasion cards issued {{in a foreign country}} may not be accepted by a merchant or ATM due to contractual or legal restrictions.|$|R
5000|$|Dana White, the UFC {{president}} also defended the event, stating: [...] "You cannot say a card sucks until it's over. It's {{like when we}} are sitting down and debating over {{who is going to}} win a fight. The cards get criticised and those are the events that normally end up being the most exciting, with great fights on them. At {{the end of the day}} you are paying to see good fights as a fan. I <b>guarantee</b> the <b>card</b> we are bringing to England will be great." ...|$|R
5000|$|Five card majors {{with a weak}} NT; both 1 and 1 {{openings}} <b>guarantee</b> 5 <b>cards.</b> Sometimes {{known as}} the [...] "Third Way" [...] system; the first system of this type was the Kaplan-Sheinwold system. To handle 4432 hands with both 4 card majors, this needs either a [...] "short club" [...] (1 can be as few as 2 cards) or both a prepared 1 and 1 which could be just 3 card suits. Five card majors are more commonly used with a strong no trump, as in Standard American.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of smart cards into trusted architectures establishes a clear-cut {{separation between the}} roles and responsibilities of both platform and user. On one hand, the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) ensures the platform trustworthiness and secures platform credentials and secrets, while smart <b>cards</b> <b>guarantee</b> user identity and protect user credentials and access authorization...|$|R
40|$|Good seller 2 ̆ 7 s {{credibility}} in the online business will boost consumer confidence in the company, lowering the perceived risk, increase customer satisfaction and increase intention to make repeat purchases. In addition to the seller 2 ̆ 7 s {{credibility in}} the online business, information {{on the performance of}} the seller in the future also light is information that {{can be used as a}} reference establishment of consumer confidence. The trust that consumers would be effect on consumer satisfaction when business transactions through online media. This study was conducted to determine the effect of institutional structures (buyer-driven certification, auction house escrow and credit <b>card</b> <b>guarantee)</b> and the seller the past performance of the trust in the seller, knowing the effect of trust in the seller and the seller the past performance of the perceived risk, knowing the effect of trust in seller and the seller past performance on customer satisfaction, knowing the effect of trust in the seller, perceived risk, customer satisfaction and the seller the past performance of the transaction intentions, and knowing the difference of consumer ratings on variable institutional structures (buyer-driven certification, auction house escrow and credit <b>card</b> <b>guarantee),</b> trust in the seller, perceived risk, customer satisfaction, seller past performance and transaction intentions based on different characteristics of the consumer. The results showed that the institutional structures (buyer-driven certification, auction house escrow and credit <b>card</b> <b>guarantee),</b> trust in the seller, customer satisfaction, and past performance sellers provide a positive influence on consumer purchase intentions in the online business. The perception of risk in this study had no influence on consumer purchase intentions in the online business. Kredibilitas penjual yang baik dalam bisnis online akan meningkatkan kepercayaan konsumen pada Perusahaan, menurunkan persepsi risiko, meningkatkan kepuasan dan meningkatkan niat untuk melakukan pembelian ulang. Selain kredibilitas penjual dalam bisnis online, informasi mengenai kinerja penjual di masa yang lampu juga merupakan informasi yang dapat digunakan sebagai referensi pembentukan kepercayaan konsumen. Kepercayaan yang dimiliki konsumen juga memberikan pengaruh terhadap kepuasan konsumen saat transaksi bisnis melalui media online. Penelitian ini dilakukan dengan tujuan untuk mengetahui pengaruh institutional structures (buyer-driven certification, auction house escrow dan credit <b>card</b> <b>guarantee)</b> dan seller past performance terhadap trust in seller, mengetahui pengaruh trust in seller dan seller past performance terhadap perceived risk, mengetahui pengaruh trust in seller dan seller past performance terhadap customer satisfaction, mengetahui pengaruh trust in seller, perceived risk, customer satisfaction dan seller past performance terhadap transaction intentions, dan mengetahui perbedaan penilaian konsumen pada variabel institusional structures (buyer-driven certification, auction house escrow dan credit <b>card</b> <b>guarantee),</b> trust in seller, perceived risk, customer satisfaction, seller past performance dan transaction intentions berdasarkan perbedaan karakteristik konsumen. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa institusional structures (buyer-driven certification, auction house escrow dan credit <b>card</b> <b>guarantee),</b> trust in seller, customer satisfaction, dan seller past performance memberikan pengaruh yang positif terhadap niat pembelian konsumen dalam bisnis online. Persepsi risiko pada penelitian ini tidak memiliki pengaruh terhadap niat pembelian konsumen dalam bisnis online...|$|R
50|$|The {{establishment}} {{may require}} guests {{to provide a}} credit <b>card</b> <b>guarantee</b> to cover potential costs such as room service or mini-bar {{for the duration of}} the stay, and to enable an express check-out at the end of the stay. At the end of the check-in, the reception staff will provide guests with a room key.|$|R
40|$|In the {{restaurant}} industry, some patrons do not honor their reservations, especially on holidays. Grounded in postpositivism and system theories, {{the purpose of}} this comparative {{study was to examine the}} impact of implementing a credit card payment policy for fine dining restaurants reservations and no shows after implementation of a credit <b>card</b> <b>guarantee</b> policy at a high-end hotel located in the southeast United States. Data were collected from archival records provided by the hotel executives. According to the results of a Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, there was a statistically significant decrease in the number of no shows, p 3 ̆c. 001, after the implementation of the credit <b>card</b> <b>guarantee</b> policy. In a paired sample t-test, there was a statistically significant decrease in the number of reservations, p 3 ̆c. 001, after implementation of the credit <b>card</b> <b>guarantee</b> policy. The implications for positive social change include the potential to increase understanding of payment policies as they relate to {{the restaurant}} industry. Service industry managers can benefit from implementing payment policies that can vary from specific dates, seasons, and type of services. Customers will also benefit by being able to make reservations not originally possible due to demand. The current study adds to service industry knowledge, increasing the understanding of payment policies as they relate to restaurant industry. Conducting a similar study in other service industries in the future may lead to a better understanding of the nature of policies and customersâ?? traits and behaviors...|$|R
25|$|Nationals of Spain are {{specifically}} required to hold proof of sufficient funds {{of at least}} R$170 per day, proof of confirmed hotel accommodation (paid or <b>guaranteed</b> by credit <b>card)</b> or a notary certified invitation letter from a resident of Brazil, and documents required for their next destination. Those traveling on business are exempt from these requirements when holding an original letter from their company, stating {{the purpose of the}} visit.|$|R
50|$|It {{can be an}} {{advantage}} {{to lead to a}} trick, because the player who leads controls the suit that is led and which others must follow; playing a suit that the leading player has many of decreases the chance that anyone else would be able to follow suit, while conversely playing a suit the player has few of allows the player to rid their hand of that suit (known as voiding the suit), freeing them from the restriction to follow suit when that suit is led by another player. On the other hand, it can also be {{an advantage}} to be the last player who plays to the trick, because at that point one has full information about the other cards played to the trick; the last player to a trick can play a card just slightly higher or lower than the current winning <b>card,</b> <b>guaranteeing</b> they will win or lose it by the minimum amount necessary, saving more valuable high or low value cards for situations where they must <b>guarantee</b> that a <b>card</b> played early to a trick will win or lose.|$|R
5000|$|Another way a card {{could be}} {{upgraded}} is by reducing their cooldown time. This {{is done by}} accumulating the number of rounds a card has battled. The number of rounds required to reduce cooldown time increases as cooldown time decreases. Another possibility is by feeding a card with another card with the same active skill, although the effect is not <b>guaranteed</b> unless five <b>cards</b> of the same active skill are fed to the same card.|$|R
