25|$|The {{role of a}} GP {{can vary}} greatly between (or even within) countries.

Meanwhile, in rural areas of developed countries or in developing countries a GP may be routinely involved in pre-hospital emergency care, the delivery of babies, community hospital care and performing low-complexity surgical procedures. In some healthcare systems GPs work <b>in</b> <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> centers where they {{play a central role in}} the healthcare team, while in other models of care GPs can work as single-handed practitioners.|$|E
25|$|The CAGE questionnaire, {{the name}} of which is an acronym of its four questions, is a widely used {{screening}} test for problem drinking and potential alcohol problems.

The CAGE questionnaire does not have a specific intended population, and is meant to find those who drink excessively and need treatment. The CAGE questionnaire is reliable and valid for assessment of alcohol abuse; however, it is not valid for diagnosis of other substance use disorders, although somewhat modified versions of the CAGE questionnaire have been frequently implemented for such a purpose.|$|E

The fact that a technological innovation appears to be a solution is not sufficient reason for introducing it. There are all kinds of reasons why an innovation that has proved useful in the hospital situation, for example, might be of doubtful use <b>in</b> <b>primary</b> health <b>care.</b> Accordingly, {{the next step is to}} assess whether a technological solution to a problem <b>in</b> <b>primary</b> health <b>care</b> is indeed an improvement.

25|$|PAs are {{employed}} by the United States Department of State as Foreign Service Health Practitioners (FSHP). PAs working in this capacity may be deployed {{anywhere in the world}} where there is a State Department facility. They provide primary care to U.S. government employees and their families in American embassies and consulates around the world. An important part of their jobs is to get to know what resources are available locally that they can count on in an emergency. FSHPs have some other important roles, such as advising their ambassadors on the health situation in the country and provide health education to the diplomatic community. In order to be considered for the position of FSHP these PAs must be licensed and have at least two years of recent experience <b>in</b> <b>primary</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E
25|$|Causes {{parallel}} the evolutionary changes {{occurring in the}} US medical system: payment based on quantity of services delivered, not quality; aging of the population increases the prevalence and complexity of chronic health conditions, {{most of which are}} handled <b>in</b> <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> settings; and increasing emphasis on life-style changes and preventative measures, often poorly covered by health insurance or not at all. In 2004, the median income of specialists in the US was twice that of PCPs, and the gap is widening. Discontent by practicing primary care internists is discouraging trainees from entering primary care; in a 2007 survey of 1,177 graduating US medical students, only 2% planned to enter a general internal medicine career, and lifestyle was emphasized over the higher subspecialty pay in their decision. Primary care practices in the United States increasingly depend on foreign medical graduates to fill depleted ranks.|$|E
