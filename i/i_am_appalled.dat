"I {{have watched}} {{particularly}} the chaos {{in my own}} state of Anambra where a small clique of renegades, openly boasting its connections in high places, seems determined to turn my homeland into a bankrupt and lawless fiefdom. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> by the brazenness of this clique and the silence, if not connivance, of the Presidency." ...|$|E

60|$|Thus was {{momentum}} {{gained in}} the Younger World. But we were without this momentum. We were just getting started, {{and we could}} not go far in a single generation. We were without weapons, without fire, and in the raw beginnings of speech. The device of writing lay {{so far in the}} future that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> when I think of it.|$|E
5000|$|Photojournalist Kevin Carter was {{the first}} to {{photograph}} a public execution by necklacing in South Africa in the mid-1980s. He later spoke of the images: [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> at what they <b>were</b> doing. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> at what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing. But then people started talking about those pictures... then I felt that maybe my actions hadn't been at all bad. Being a witness to something this horrible wasn't necessarily such a bad thing to do.|$|R
60|$|Of course, {{from the}} nature of our business, Pinkerton could do a thing of that kind at a figure {{extremely}} reduced; for all that, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> at the extravagance, and said so.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, it {{suggested}} to me words one night; it poured a strain which I {{could have written}} down, only <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled,</b> and dared not rise to seek pencil and paper by the dim watch-light.|$|R
60|$|Personally <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> by the {{destruction}} already {{done in the}} world in the past seven years. I doubt if any untravelled American can realize how much of Europe is already broken up. I do not think many people realize how swiftly Europe is still sinking, how urgent it is to get European affairs put back upon a basis of the common good if civilization is to be saved.|$|E
6000|$|After the Supervisor {{had rolled}} {{himself in the}} blanket, long after all sounds had ceased in the tent, there still {{remained}} for the youth a score of manifold excitations to wakefulness. Down on the lake the muskrats and beavers were at their work. Nocturnal birds uttered uncanny, disturbing cries. Some animal with stealthy crackling tread was ranging the hillside, and {{the roar of the}} little fall, so far from lulling him to sleep--as he had imagined it would--stimulated his imagination till he could discern in it the beat of scurrying wings and the patter of pernicious padded feet. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> by the wilderness now, what would it seem to me were I alone!" [...] he whispered.|$|E
60|$|Altogether a {{depressing}} day of rain-splatter and wash of water across the deck. I can see, now, {{that the problem}} of sailing a ship with five thousand tons of coal around the Horn is more serious than I had thought. So deep is the Elsinore in the water that she is like a log awash. Her tall, six-foot bulwarks of steel cannot keep the seas from boarding her. She has not the buoyancy one is accustomed to ascribe to ships. On the contrary, she is weighted down until she is dead, so that, for this one day alone, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> at the thought of how many thousands of tons of the North Atlantic have boarded her and poured out through her spouting scuppers and clanging ports.|$|E
6000|$|... "Too much {{is written}} by the men who can't write about the men who do write," [...] Martin concurred. [...] "Why, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> at the {{quantities}} of rubbish written about Stevenson and his work." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Our {{director}} was a humorless jerk," [...] recalled Baker later. [...] "Roger Moore took so much abuse from Irving Rapper that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled,</b> {{but he took}} it like a man {{and went on to}} do a very professional job." ...|$|R
40|$|Mr Rector, {{members of}} the council, ladies and gentlemen, fellow students. My immedi-ate {{pleasure}} at being asked to give the Schermerhorn Lecture was rapidly superseded- after I had accepted- by {{a great sense of}} inadequacy. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> at my temerity in accepting the invitation.

6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} we haven't lost {{something}} by becoming enslaved to the great city! Our pleasures are more intense, but they do wear us out. Think of you and me to-morrow night--our anxiety fairly cancelling our pleasure--and then think of your brother going leisurely home to his wife, his babies, and his books. I don't know--sometimes when I think of growing old in a flat or a hotel <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled.</b> I hate to keep mother here. Sometimes I think of giving it all up {{for a year or}} two and going back to the country, just to see how it would affect me. I don't want to get artificial and slangy with no interests but the stage, like so many good actresses I know. It's such a horribly egotistic business--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I obey. In kings, mollusca, and toad-stools, life is {{one thing}} and the same. The Philosopher Dumdi pronounces it a certain febral {{vibration}} of organic parts, operating upon the vis inertia of unorganized matter. But Bardianna says nay. Hear him. 'Who put together this marvelous mechanism of mine; and wound it up, to go for three score years and ten; when it runs out, and strikes Time's hours no more? And what is it, that daily and hourly renews, and by a miracle, creates in me my flesh and my blood? What keeps up the perpetual telegraphic communication between my outpost toes and digits, and that domed grandee up aloft, my brain?--It is not I; nor you; nor he; nor it. No; when I place my hand to that king muscle my heart, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled.</b> I feel the great God himself at work in me. Oro is life.'" ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR CHARLES, - <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> {{to gather}} from your last just to hand {{that you have}} felt so much concern about the letter. Pray dismiss it from your mind. But I think you scarce {{appreciate}} how disagreeable {{it is to have}} your private affairs and private unguarded expressions getting into print. It would soon sicken any one of writing letters. I have no doubt that letter was very wisely selected, but it just shows how things crop up. There was a raging jealousy between the two yachts; our captain was nearly in a fight over it. However, no more; and whatever you think, my dear fellow, do not suppose me angry with you or -; although I was ANNOYED AT THE CIRCUMSTANCE - a very different thing. But it is difficult to conduct life by letter, and I continually feel I may be drifting into some matter of offence, in which my heart takes no part.|$|E
60|$|I, who, {{in view of}} Schultz's psychology, {{knew how}} true that must <b>be,</b> admit that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled.</b> So this <b>was</b> how a perfidious destiny took {{advantage}} of a generous impulse! And I felt as though <b>I</b> <b>were</b> an accomplice in this perfidy, since I did {{to a certain extent}} encourage Jasper. Yet I had warned him as well.|$|R
5000|$|The more I {{studied the}} Bible, however, I {{had to admit}} that the {{prosperity}} message did not line up with the tenor of Scripture. My heart was crushed to think that I led so many people astray. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> that <b>I</b> could have <b>been</b> so wrong, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> deeply grateful that God had not struck me dead as a false prophet! ...|$|R
2500|$|Carl states that: [...] "It was she [...] who {{introduced}} me to science fiction and fantasy in general and Tolkien in particular." [...] and [...] "Recently I re-read my first published fantasy novels. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> to discover I'd used several Tolkien-esque phrases — quite unconsciously, as {{so much of his}} prose is now lodged deep in my subconscious." ...|$|R
60|$|These are sardonic times. Look at Greece, {{and that}} whole shabby muddle. But I am not {{sorry to be}} alive and privileged to look on. If I were not a hermit I {{would go to the}} House every day and see those people scuffle over it and blether about the brotherhood of the human race. This has been a bitter year for English pride, and I don't like to see England humbled--that is, not too much. We are sprung from her loins, and it hurts me. I am for republics, and she is the only comrade we've got, in that. We can't count France, and there is hardly enough of Switzerland to count. Beneath the {{governing}} crust England is sound-hearted--and sincere, too, and nearly straight. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> to notice that the wide extension of the surface has damaged her manners, and made her rather Americanly uncourteous on the lower levels.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is better}} for you and better for me {{that we do not}} meet [...] again--at least till I have won the {{tolerance}} of your brother and [...] manager and my own self-respect. The work I have done is honest [...] work; I will not admit that it is wholly bad, but I cannot meet [...] Hugh again till I can demand consideration. It was not so much the [...] words he used as the tone. I was helpless in resenting it. That I [...] am a beggar, a dangerous influence, I admit. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> at the [...] thought of what I have done to injure you. Cast me overboard. Not [...] even your beauty, your great fame, can make my work vital to the [...] public. I am too perverse, too individual. There is good in me, but [...] it is evil to you. I no longer care what they say of me, but I feel [...] every word derogatory of you {{as if it were a}} red-hot point of [...] steel. I did not sleep last night; I spent the time in [...] reconstructing myself. I confessed my grievous sins, and I long to [...] do penance. This play is also a failure. I grew cold with hate of [...] myself last night as I thought of the irreparable injury I had done [...] to you.

It's inward, but I who know mother, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled.</b> I haven't the courage to face it any longer. It's all my fault; I suppose I cannot play a part; I've never before hidden {{anything}} from mother. There has never been an occasion for anything of that sort between us. But you know yourself the reason why I refrained from telling her at once of Mr. Razumov's arrival here. You understand, don't you? Owing to her unhappy state. And--there--I am no actress. My own feelings being strongly engaged, I somehow.... I don't know. She noticed something in my manner. She thought I was concealing something from her. She noticed my longer absences, and, in fact, as I have been meeting Mr. Razumov daily, I used to stay away longer than usual when I went out. Goodness knows what suspicions arose in her mind. You know that {{she has not been}} herself ever since.... So this evening she--who has been so awfully silent: for weeks-began to talk all at once. She said that {{she did not want to}} reproach me; that I had my character as she had her own; that she did not want to pry into my affairs or even into my thoughts; for her part, she had never had anything to conceal from her children...cruel things to listen to. And all this in her quiet voice, with that poor, wasted face as calm as a stone. It was unbearable." ...|$|E
5000|$|After using MacDraw {{to create}} all the specs for TriStation, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> at how {{primitive}} and tedious it <b>was</b> and <b>I</b> had the insight {{that you could}} create an object-oriented graphics program like MacDraw where the visual properties of an object could be linked to changing data values. The Productivity implications of that were astounding compared to the approach used by the FIX and others.|$|R
60|$|And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> at {{the price}} French Frank had paid--eighty cents. EIGHTY CENTS! It was an outrage to my thrifty soul. Eighty cents--the {{equivalent}} of eight long hours of my toil at the machine, gone down our throats, and gone like that, in a twinkling, leaving only a bad taste in the mouth. There was no discussion that French Frank was a waster.|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> say, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{not afraid}} to meet my own death, there, {{a few hundred yards}} to leeward; but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> at the thought that Maud must die. My cursed {{imagination}} saw her beaten and mangled against the rocks, and it <b>was</b> too terrible. <b>I</b> strove to compel myself to think we would make the landing safely, and so I spoke, not what I believed, but what I preferred to believe.|$|R
5000|$|He twice {{refused the}} Nigerian honour Commander of the Federal Republic, in 2004 and 2011, saying:"I have watched {{particularly}} the chaos {{in my own}} state of Anambra where a small clique of renegades, openly boasting its connections in high places, seems determined to turn my homeland into a bankrupt and lawless fiefdom. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> by the brazenness of this clique and the silence, if not connivance, of the Presidency." ...|$|E
5000|$|Prime Minister Gordon Brown, said [...] "I {{was deeply}} {{shocked to learn}} of the bomb blasts in Karachi that have killed over a hundred people and injured so many others. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> by this horrific use of {{violence}} against entirely innocent people...On behalf of the British Government please accept my sincerest condolences for those Pakistanis {{who have lost their}} lives.

5000|$|As a Latina {{and a new}} American citizen, I {{believe in}} this country and its people, and I believe that we need more than just [...] "change." [...] We need a leader who can bring about the right kind of change, and John McCain has the {{experience}} and judgment necessary to lead us in these uncertain times.

60|$|Poor fellow! Little we both {{thought that}} before very long he himself... However, I {{could give him}} no comfort. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> rather <b>appalled</b> myself.|$|R
5000|$|As far as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> concerned, Muslims {{enjoyed a}} better {{lifestyle}} in non-Muslim Britain {{than they did}} in Muslim Saudi Arabia. ...All my talk of ummah seemed so juvenile now. .... Racism {{was an integral part of}} Saudi society. My students often used the word “nigger” to describe black people. Even dark-skinned Arabs were considered inferior to their lighter-skinned cousins. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> living in the world’s most avowedly Muslim country, yet I found it anything but. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>appalled</b> by the imposition of Wahhabism in the public realm, something I had implicitly sought as an Islamist.|$|R

5000|$|On {{occasion}} he also {{attempted to}} force votes on issues {{he was concerned}} with, such as the motion for increasing assistance to the unemployed on 25 March 1958:"I wish to state that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>appalled</b> at the callous indifference of the Parliamentary Secretary... The statement {{that there is no}} money to give these unfortunate people a further increase will be regarded by decent Christian people as a downright lie. I am still convinced that, with any kind of honest effort, the lot of the poorer sections of our people could be improved. The unemployed and the old age pensioners will continue to press for elementary Christian justice. I have asked, and I now repeat my request, for a free vote of the House on this issue." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Among Palestinians in Jordan, Dr. Daoud Hanania personifies Palestinian success. As {{director}} of medical {{services in the}} Jordanian armed forces and as chief of cardiovascular surgery at the King Hussein Medical Center, Hanania, 48, {{is one of the}} pre-eminent specialists in his field in the Middle East. He {{is one of the first}} in the region to perform open-heart surgery, a technique he learned under Dr. Michael E. DeBakey in Houston. He is distraught by the fighting in Beirut—partly because his sister lives there and refuses to move.

5000|$|They’ll say the IMF is arrogant. They’ll say the IMF doesn’t really {{listen to}} the {{developing}} countries {{it is supposed to}} help. They’ll say the IMF is secretive and insulated from democratic accountability. They’ll say the IMF's economic ‘remedies’ often make things worse turning slowdowns into recessions and recessions into depressions. And they’ll have a point. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> chief economist at the World Bank from 1996 until last November, during the gravest global economic crisis in a half-century.

60|$|Mingled with my anxiety, {{which was}} real, was an exultation {{that would not}} down.

With such a cloud hanging over me I passed a restless night.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the middle}} of the night, Betsey and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>appalled</b> by a {{tremendous}} knocking on the wall.
