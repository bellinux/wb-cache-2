40|$|This paper {{describes}} the multi-pillar {{social security reform}} strategy that many countries have been adopting in recent years. This strategy includes a public pillar that provides a social safety net, a privately managed funded pillar that handles peoples ’ mandatory retirement savings, and a voluntary pillar {{for people who want}} more consumption in old age. The basic rationale is that relying to some extent on funding and defined contribution plans enhances system sustainability and has a positive impact on the broader economy. The paper contrasts three variations on the multi-pillar model [...] the Latin American model pioneered by Chile, in which individual workers choose the investment manager for their retirement funds; the OECD model first adopted by Switzerland, in which employers are required to provide a retirement plan and (sometimes together with union trustees) choose the investment manager; and the Swedish model in which a large notional DC plan is supplemented by a smaller funded DC plan, with <b>investment</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> by managers who agree to abide by special negotiated fees.

In the limelight of the 'job export 1 debate which paralleled these investment flows was the question: 'Do foreign direct investment flows have a job displacement effect (a substitutive character) or do foreign direct Investments promote domestic employment and export levels (possessing a complementary nature) ?'. Empirically, it has been observed that foreign direct Investment flows demonstrate a high level of congruity with damestic import-export trade structures. German Companies with high levels of foreign direct investment also rank high in exports, thus offering evidence supporting the complementary nature of these investments. However, it must be recognized that a streng substitutive relationship may under certain conditions exist. Applying a simple international trade model incorporating a multinational enterprise, imperfect competition and exchange rate risk parameter constellations are examined in which foreign direct investment flows exhibit a substitutive - rather - complementary character. It is demonstrated that given exchange rate risk as well as international produetion cost comparative advantages foreign direct investment flows substitute potential export flows.

40|$|Fiji exports {{approximately}} 800 t year- 1 of 'Solo Sunrise' papaya {{marketed as}} 'Fiji Red' to international markets which include New Zealand, Australia and Japan. The wet weather conditions from November to April each year {{result in a}} significant increase in fungal diseases present in Fiji papaya orchards. The two major pathogens that are causing significant post-harvest losses are: stem end rot (Phytophthora palmivora) and anthracnose (Colletotrichum spp.). The high incidence of post-harvest rots has led to increased rejection rates all along the supply chain, causing a reduction in income to farmers, exporters, importers and retailers of Fiji papaya. It has also undermined the superior quality reputation on the market. In response to this issue, the Fiji Papaya industry led by Nature's Way Cooperative, embarked on series of trials supported by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) to determine the most effective and economical post-harvest control in Fiji papaya. Of all the treatments that were examined, a hot water dip treatment was selected by the industry as the most appropriate technology given the level of control that it provide, the cost effectiveness of the treatment {{and the fact that it}} was non-chemical.

40|$|To {{continue}} with a project, which is failing in an escalating manner, are an economically irrational decision, but one, which contains psychological motivations. The decision-makers display some difficulty in failing {{to consider the}} costs arising {{from the past and}} keep investing new resources. This is the "Sunk Cost Effect"(SCE), the main subject of this research. Two assumptions were developed. (1) The probability of continuing to invest increases as the non-returned investment (the sunk cost) is greater and is closer to the total planned investment. (2) The decision to go on investing when the sunk cost is stated {{as a percentage of the}} planned one is more likely to happen than when the sunk cost is stated in absolute terms. The hypotheses were tested on two hundred postgraduate students, distributed randomly among eight groups of twenty five students, each independent of one another, using a 2 x 4 experimental plan, where the independent variables are as follows: the <b>investment</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out,</b> structured according to four different levels and the way in which the investment levels are expressed; in other words as an absolute or percentage value compared to the amount planned for investment. The dependent variable is dichotomous in its answers - yes or no answers - to {{continue with}} a lost investment. The results largely confirm the hypotheses formulated. Effectively, the size of the sunk cost and the proximity to the end of the initial objective has an amplifying effect on the decision to persist with the investment, which is not bearing fruit. Moreover, with the exception of extreme situations, the decision-makers reveal a greater willingness to continue with the investment when the problem is presented in proportional terms. The conclusion is that the "Sunk Cost Effect" exists and motivates economically irrational forms of behavior. The decision-maker is a "slave" to past decisions, thus increasing the sunk cost and finds him in difficulties he is unable to overcome. In some situations, the percentage form of expressing the investment seems to more vigorously induce economically erroneous decisions...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to give an {{overview}} of recent developments in Belgium 2 ̆ 019 s direct investment relations with the rest of the world. The analysis is based mainly on two sets of statistics drawn up by the National Bank of Belgium, namely, data on direct investment flows from the balance of payments on the one hand, and the results of an annual survey on direct <b>investment</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> among Belgian companies, on the other. Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows between Belgium and the rest of the world have, broadly speaking, followed relatively similar trends to FDI flows observed worldwide, but at the same time have shown some specific characteristics, such as the influence of a few sporadic operations involving large amounts and significant differences within the various components making up FDI inflows and outflows, the former consisting essentially of capital injections in companies and the latter mainly taking the form of intercompany loans. This particular structural pattern stems from the presence of the coordination centres in Belgium and the special tax status that these companies enjoy. Apart from those investment flows attributable to the coordination centres, a large part of the FDI inflows recorded in the balance of payments concern investment by multinationals in third countries, for which resident companies act as intermediaries. Still disregarding funds invested in the coordination centres, the total figures compiled on the basis of the annual survey show that foreign shareholdings in Belgian firms, as measured on the basis of their book value, have stabilized since 2002. Moreover, statistics for subsidiaries of foreign companies established in Belgium show that there is still a fairly high proportion of them active in relatively labour-intensive industrial sectors. As for Belgium 2 ̆ 019 s FDI, the results of the direct investment survey point to a gradual expansion in Belgian companies 2 ̆ 019 activities abroad, which are developing at a faster pace than their domestic business. Both data on outstanding equity and those for subsidiaries abroad indicate that foreign direct investment by resident firms is largely concentrated in other developed countries with similar economic features to Belgium 2 ̆ 019 s. This would tend to suggest that the extent of straight business relocations to low-wage countries by Belgian firms via investments abroad remains relatively limited...|$|E
40|$|O presente artigo discute as implicações fiscais do empréstimo de R$ 100 bilhões da União ao BNDES em 2009. Tal operação permitiu ao Banco ampliar significativamente sua capacidade de financiamento aos projetos de inversão de longa maturação e viabilizou uma ação anticíclica {{relevante}} no contexto da crise, desde o final de 2008 e ao longo de 2009. O texto apresenta uma estimativa dos custos fiscais diretos associados a tal empréstimo. O artigo defende, ademais, que uma avaliação mais ampla dos efeitos fiscais deve ser mediada por uma discussão dos efeitos alocativos da ação do Banco. Nessa perspectiva, discute-se o seu papel no enfrentamento das falhas de mercado relativas à provisão de financiamento de longo prazo em moeda local e sua relevância como mecanismo de estabilização dos ciclos de crédito em contextos de crise. Sustenta-se que, ao afetar positivamente o nível de investimento executado, esse empréstimo gera impactos indiretos positivos sobre a renda e a arrecadação federal que mitigam materialmente os custos fiscais diretos estimados, porvia de efeitos multiplicadores da renda, sob a ótica da demanda no curto prazo, e do efeito defasado do investimento sobre o estoque de capital e o produto potencial, sob a ótica da oferta, no longo prazo. The present paper {{discusses the}} fiscal {{implications of the}} R$ 100 billion loan {{from the federal government}} to BNDES in 2009. This operation allowed the Bank to significantly increase its fi nancing capabilities to support long-term investment projects and made relevant anti-cyclical efforts feasible {{in the context of the}} crisis. The text presents direct fiscal cost estimates associated to the loan conditions. The paper also argues that a broader assessment of the fiscal impacts of such transaction should take into account a deeper discussion on the effects of BNDES’ efforts on the allocation of resources. In this context, the discussion focuses on the role the Bank plays to mitigate a market failure regarding the lack of adequate provision of long term funds in local currency to support investment activity and its importance as a mechanism to stabilize credit cycles in moment of crisis. It is argued that, as it mitigates long term credit rationing in local currency, its actions plays a positive role on the level of <b>investment</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out.</b> Therefore the loan in question brings about indirect positive impacts on income and federal tax collections that materially mitigate the estimated direct fi scal costs. This is due, at the demand side, to the short term income multiplier effects triggered by investment decisions that were sustained because of the adequate credit provision in the after-shock of the crises. On top of those short term, demand related implications, the paper also discusses, at the supply side of the equation, the lagged effects of the investment sustained on the path followed by the capital stock and the potential output, boosting the long term expected federal tax collections.

40|$|Includes bibliographyForeword The Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and Government,which met in Panama in November 2000, {{devoted a}} good part of its {{deliberations}} to the subject o children and youth. It recognized the importance of their rights,as clearly enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child,which all the Ibero-American countries have signed. It also identified the most urgent problems acing boys,girls and adolescents and,in the Panama Declaration 2000,set forth the strategies for resolving them. As these priorities were established,it became clear that there was a need for a thorough,detailed evaluation of the living conditions of Ibero-American boys,girls and adolescents {{at the close of the}} twentieth century. Accordingly,the heads of State and government concluded that it was essential for a study to be produced to supply such an evaluation,complement the strategies they had decided on and,perhaps most importantly,set specific targets to provide a basis for solid progress towards the much looked-for implementation of the Rights of the Child. In response to this call from the Tenth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and Government,the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC),in collaboration with the United Nations Children s Fund (UNICEF) and the Secretariat for Iberoamerican Cooperation (SECIB),prepared the study Building Equity from the Beginning:the Children and Adolescents of Ibero-America. Generous and substantial assistance was provided by a number of international organizations,which are referred to in this work. The study reveals a mixed picture. On the one hand, the last decade of the twentieth century saw substantial progress in overcoming some of the problems that have traditionally affected children and youth in Ibero-America. The greatest achievements were in the field of social rights,i. e.,health,nutrition and education,largely as a result of the stimulus provided by the 1990 World Summit for Children and the 27 specific goals it laid down. Unfortunately,despite these achievements,there are still pronounced inequalities among countries and among social groups within them. Furthermore,the environment generated by current development models seems to be shaping twenty-first century economic and social events in a way that is limiting the scope for further progress in the short term and perhaps in the medium and long terms as well,preventing the social <b>investment</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> in recent years from yielding the return expected,and heightening the tendency towards inequity among and within countries. If this is to be avoided,it is vital that higher priority be given to enforcing the rights of boys, girls and adolescents and that greater resources be put into social investment that a ects them,with a view to achieving substantial improvements in their living conditions and ensuring equality of opportunities. It is clear,then,that the progress achieved can be consolidated only if renewed,persistent e orts are made. If this does not happen,not only will the basic living conditions with which economic rights are concerned improve more slowly,but the civil,political and cultural rights of boys,girls and adolescents in Ibero-America will increasingly be flouted. The study Building Equity rom the Beginning:the Children and Adolescents of Ibero-America has thus been produced in response to the request made by the Tenth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and Government,headed by the President of Panama,Mireya Moscoso,and its purpose is to underpin the strategies set forth in the Panama Declaration. It is now essential for these strategies to be implemented in the different countries so that genuine respect can be secured for the rights of boys,girls and adolescents in Ibero-America.
