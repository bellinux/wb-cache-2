In fact, as I {{said some}} time ago, the whole {{landscape}} of Claude {{was nothing but}} a more or less softened continuance of the old traditions of missal-painting, of which I gave examples in the previous volume. The general notion of rock which may be traced in the earliest work, as Figs. 1 and 2 in Plate +10+ Vol. III. is of an upright mass cut out with an adze; as art advances, the painters begin to perceive <b>horizontal</b> <b>stratification,</b> and, as in all the four other examples of that plate, show something like true rendering of the fracture of rocks in vertical joints with superimposed projecting masses. They insist on this type, thinking it frowning or picturesque, and usually exhibit it to more advantage by putting a convent, hermitage, or castle on the projection of the crag. In the blue backgrounds of the missals the projection is often wildly extravagant; for instance, the MS. Additional, 11,696 Brit. Mus., has all its backgrounds composed of blue rocks with towers upon them, of which Fig. 85 is a characteristic example (magnified in scale about one-third; but, I think, rather diminished in extravagance of projection). It is infinitely better drawn than Claude's rocks ever are, in the expression of cleavage; but certainly somewhat too bold in standing. Then, in more elaborate work, we get conditions of precipice like Fig. 3 in Plate +10+, which, indeed, is not ill-drawn in many respects; and the book from which it is taken shows other evidences of a love of nature sufficiently rare at the period, though joined quaintly with love of the grotesque: for instance, the writer, giving an account of the natural productions of Saxony, illustrates his chapter {{with a view of the}} salt mines; he represents the brine-spring, conducted by a wooden trough from the rock into an evaporating-house where it is received in a pan, under which he has painted scarlet flames of fire with singular skill; and the rock out of which the brine flows is in its general cleavages the best I ever saw drawn by mediæval art. But it is carefully wrought to the resemblance of a grotesque human head.|$|E

50|$|Meroplankton species {{composition}} depends on spatial distribution and reproductive habits of adults {{in a given}} area. Biotic and abiotic factors such as tidal and lunar cycles and availability of food determine adult spawning schedules, in turn, determining subsequent meroplankton populations. Behavioural factors, such as predator avoidance are also important. Freshwater inputs {{play a key role}} in meroplankton {{species composition}} in estuarine environments. Effects of tides contribute greatly to meroplankton species distribution. One study conducted in a Patagonian Fjord found that species composition of the meroplankton community depended on the seasonally varying input levels from the Baker river as well as vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>stratification</b> of the water column. Events such as wind driven upwelling and downwelling also affect meroplankton species distribution. Most species are swept in the direction of the flow of water, either off shore during an upwelling or near shore during a downwelling. Some species, such as bivalve larvae, have the ability to maintain their nearshore position during these events.|$|E

30|$|Macroscopic {{observation}} of the core shows that the whole sedimentary sequence is characterized by silty clay and silt or sand interbeds (Fig. 3). Sand is prevalent in the sequence except for the upper parts of the sections where layers of fine sand approximately 1 – 3 m thick are intercalated in the thick silt. Sand mainly occurs as two different types, with a form of fine- to coarse-grained, massive, or well-sorted, as trough cross-stratified, ripple-laminated sand layers varying in thickness from approximately 5 to 15 m (e.g. 133 – 118 m) and enclosed by the clay or silt with lenticular structure (e.g., 72 – 63 m). Rare <b>horizontal</b> <b>stratifications</b> of silty clay can be found between the thick layers of sands, characterized by being thick {{in the middle of}} the sequence (> 5 m) and thin in the crest and bottom (1 – 3 m). Pure clay occurs rarely. Some thin black organic-rich clay layers are mostly related to lacustrine deposits.|$|R

Understanding of seasonal variability of salinity at Kuroshio in the East China Sea (ECS Kuroshio) {{can provide a}} scientific basis to reveal the climate-environment change in East China. In this paper, Using salinity database of World Ocean Atlas 2009 (WOA 09) issued by NOAA in 2010, the change of salinity distribution and the high-salt areas at ECS Kuroshio with seasons have been analyzed, the results show that: upper low-salinity water between 0 ~ 125 m is obviously changing with seasons. From spring to winter, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stratification</b> at upper low-salinity water first increases and then decreases, but the phenomenon of vertical mixing is opposite with the <b>horizontal</b> <b>stratification.</b> The <b>horizontal</b> <b>stratification</b> is the most obvious in summer, it forms 0. 33 /m of halocline strength above 10 m; the vertical mixing is the strongest in winter, upper low-salinity water mixes with higher-salinity water in Okinawa trough, and salinity is homogenous in vertical above 250 m. There are seasonal variations of depth and range of the high-salt areas in different segments along ECS Kuroshio, and there are three high salinity cores in the high-salt areas: two of the high salinity cores appear in the sea area east of Taiwan in autumn and winter, the third core appears in the sea area northwest of Miyako-jima in spring...|$|E

40|$|Ageostrophic {{baroclinic}} instabilities develop {{within the}} surface mixed {{layer of the}} ocean at horizontal fronts and efficiently restratify the upper ocean. In this paper a parameterization for the restratification driven by finite-amplitude baroclinic instabilities of the mixed layer is proposed {{in terms of an}} overturning streamfunction that tilts isopycnals from the vertical to the horizontal. The streamfunction is proportional to the product of the horizontal density gradient, the mixed layer depth squared, and the inertial period. Hence restratification proceeds faster at strong fronts in deep mixed layers with a weak latitude dependence. In this paper the parameterization is theoretically motivated, confirmed to perform well {{for a wide range of}} mixed layer depths, rotation rates, and vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>stratifications.</b> It is shown to be superior to alternative extant parameterizations of baroclinic instability for the problem of mixed layer restratification.

Differential equations describing the behaviour of such materials contain rapidly fluctuating coefficients, in view of this, solution of such equations is more time-consuming when using today’s computers. The method of asymptotic averaging leads to getting homogeneous medium under study to averaged equations with fixed factors. The present article is concerned with stratified soil mass consisting of pair-wise alternative isotropic elastic layers.

40|$|A self-consistent regional-scale {{model of}} the crust and upper mantle for the {{southern}} Arabian Shield and Red Sea paar has been constructed from an integrated interpretation of seismic deep refraction, regional gravity, aeromagnetic, heat flow, and surface geologic data. The Shield consists of two 20 -km-thick layers of crust with an average compressional wave velocity in the upper crust of about 6. 3 km/s and in the lower crust of about 7. 0 km/s. This crust thins abruptly to less than 20 km near the southwestern end of the transect, where Precambrian outcrops abut the Cenozoic rocks, and to 8 km beneath the Farasan Islands. The data over the Red Sea westward of Precambrian outcrop are fit satisfactorily by an oceanic crustal model. The major velocity discontinuities occur {{at about the same}} depth across the entire shield and indicate <b>horizontal</b> metamorphic <b>stratification</b> of the Precambrian crust.

This model provides a mechanism that explains the observed topographic uplift, regional gravity anomaly pattern, heat flow, and mantle seismic velocities.
