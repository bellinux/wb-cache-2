40|$|Abstract � This paper aims at {{identifying}} top {{challenges faced}} by IT executives in <b>IT</b> <b>infrastructures</b> to help the formulation of meaningful research questions. The introduction of this paper describes the importance of <b>IT</b> <b>infrastructures</b> to organizations. The top challenges {{according to a recent}} survey are also introduced in the state-of-the-art section. Then, to improve our understanding and face challenges, we propose an approach based upon a research method and we describe several research techniques that we plan to use (e. g. laddering technique) and the use of empirical research in <b>IT</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Finally, we present the expected contributions, work already performed and some preliminary results...|$|R

40|$|We {{argue that}} insider threat is a {{placeholder}} term that accompanies {{the transition from}} securing <b>IT</b> <b>infrastructures</b> to securing the socio-technical systems made possible by these <b>IT</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> The term insider in its literal interpretation loses meaning in a context {{where there are no}} stable perime-ters one can refer to. Business practices such as outsourcing, employing temporary contractors, and the very use of IT, have removed security perimeters in the search for short-term efficiency gains, which may result in mid-term losses due to increased vulnerabilities. We conclude that securing socio-technical systems calls for the design of organisational (business) processes that remain viable once inside information about their implementation becomes available to potential attackers rather than for the deployment of secure <b>IT</b> <b>infrastructures...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} propose and {{validate}} a methodology {{for the development}} of integrated Information Technology (<b>IT)</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> The motivation for putting forward a new methodology is grounded on the limitations of the various software engineering methodologies (traditional) that exist today. Despite that the traditional methodologies result in the development of Information Systems (IS) from scratch, Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) builds integrated <b>IT</b> <b>infrastructures</b> using existing applications. This significant difference is associated with many issues needed to be realised and addressed like: (a) the changes that such an infrastructure brings to organisations, (b) the resistance to change and (c) the extension of IS lifecycle’s. The proposed methodology consist of eight stages and aims at supporting software engineers, organisations and researchers to build integrated <b>IT</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> As a result the methodology seeks to contribute to the body of knowledge...|$|R

According to Gartner, through 2018 more than 30% of enterprises will use capacity management tools for their critical <b>IT</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> up from less than 5% in 2014. These capacity management tools help infrastructure and operations management teams plan and optimize <b>IT</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and tools, and balance the use of external and cloud computing service providers.|$|R
