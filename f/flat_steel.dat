25|$|On October 15, 1970, the West Gate Bridge in Melbourne, Australia collapsed, killing 35 {{construction}} workers. The subsequent enquiry {{found that}} the failure arose because engineers had specified the supply of a quantity of <b>flat</b> <b>steel</b> plate. The word flat in this context lacked an operational definition, {{so there was no}} test for accepting or rejecting a particular shipment or for controlling quality.|$|E
25|$|The pipes were {{manufactured}} locally from <b>flat</b> <b>steel</b> sheets {{imported from}} Germany and the United States. Mephan Ferguson {{was awarded the}} first manufacturing contract and built a fabrication plant at Falkirk (now known as the Perth suburb of Maylands) to produce half of the 60,000 pipes required. Hoskins Engineering established a factory near Midland Junction (now known simply as Midland) to produce the other half.|$|E
25|$|New in 1971 were tubular {{landing gear}} legs with a 16% greater width (6feet 6inches (1.98m) to 7feet 7inches (2.31m) for better ground handling. These {{replaced}} the previous <b>flat</b> <b>steel</b> leaf spring gear. Also in 1971, the landing and taxi lights were {{moved from the}} wing leading edge to the nose bowl to better illuminate the ground. They were an improvement, but bulb life was reduced due to the heat and vibration of that location. They were {{moved back to the}} wing on the 1984 model Cessna 152.|$|E

2500|$|Jack {{renamed the}} yard the Chester Shipbuilding Company, {{and used it}} mostly for {{converting}} freighters into oil tankers. Lacking steel fabrication facilities of his own, Jack contracted with the American Bridge Company in Pittsburgh to supply the plates for the ships' hulls [...] and oil tanks. This innovation in building ships from prefabricated parts manufactured in distant locations {{was made possible by}} Jack's simplified hull designs, which made as much use as possible of <b>flat</b> <b>steel</b> plates that could be easily produced and which required a minimum of post-production fitting. Jack's prefabricated method would later be emulated by the Emergency Fleet Corporation in its emergency wartime shipyards.|$|E
2500|$|In 1914, {{the company}} {{received}} its first product patent for [...] "The Victor," [...] a fireproof steel wastebasket. The Victor gained popularity {{due to its}} light weight—achieved through a patented process of bending <b>flat</b> <b>steel</b> {{at right angles to}} create boxes—and its ability to prevent fires at a time when smoking was common indoors, particularly in the workplace. In 1915, the company began manufacturing and distributing steel desks after designing and producing 200 for Boston's first skyscraper, the Custom House Tower. In 1937, the company collaborated with Frank Lloyd Wright on office furniture for the Johnson Wax Headquarters. The partnership lasted two years and resulted in some of the first modern workstations.|$|E

50|$|With {{the need}} to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the trend is to make lighter auto bodies, yet without sacrificing their {{aptitude}} to protect car passengers in case of accidents. Steel manufacturers are currently developing {{a new generation of}} <b>flat</b> carbon <b>steels</b> dual-phase steel. However these steels are more exposed, in terms of properties consistency, to process variations than other conventional <b>flat</b> carbon <b>steels.</b> Therefore, adequate measurement tools are required to at least check the production scatter and control it.|$|R
40|$|This paper models {{linkages}} between {{upstream and downstream}} goods in the U. S. market for flat-rolled steel. These vertical linkages are important to account for when estimating the impact of trade restrictions on imports of <b>flat</b> rolled <b>steel</b> because some types of <b>flat</b> rolled <b>steel</b> are predominately used to produce other types of <b>flat</b> rolled <b>steel</b> {{and in some cases}} also make up a large share of their production costs. Previous research has modeled the {{linkages between}} upstream and downstream goods with CGE models and vertically linked partial equilibrium models. Drawing upon this literature, this paper builds a vertically linked version of the CES COMPAS model that incorporates vertical linkages as constant cross price elasticities in both downstream supply functions and upstream factor demand functions. Compared to estimates from the CES COMPAS without vertical linkages, introduction of a trade restriction increases demand for upstream goods and decreases supply of downstream goods, increasing prices of both upstream and downstream goods, while increasing shipments of upstream goods and decreasing shipments of downstream goods. In estimating the impact of the safeguard measures imposed on the <b>flat</b> rolled <b>steel</b> market, accounting for the vertical linkages is most important when estimating the impact on domestically produced slab since all downstream products produced from slab were subject to the safeguard tariffs.

2500|$|The car {{featured}} a low modern body {{line with a}} prominent waist level groove reminiscent of the then fashionable Chevrolet Corvair. [...] At a time when monocoque construction was becoming mainstream, the 24 sat on a separate and very strong tubular steel chassis: [...] it was therefore possible, even using the economically available materials of the time, to keep the window pillars relatively thin which gave the car an airy cabin and outstanding all-round visibility, while class leading structural rigidity for the body could nonetheless be claimed, thanks to the pleating and reinforcement of the roof panel. The tubular steel front and rear subchassis were bolted to a platform frame that comprised {{the floor and the}} <b>flat</b> <b>steel</b> sidemembers. Under the skin, the structural architecture was little changed from that of the Dyna 54.|$|E
60|$|When all was ready, {{the door}} of the barn was closed, and the lamp {{balanced}} upon an empty packing-case. The bag of bricks was laid upon two trestles, and the broad steel girdle was buckled round it. Then the great flanges, the wires, and the metal box containing the motor were in turn attached to the girdle.

60|$|This {{extraordinary}} {{piece of}} mechanism, which {{was called the}} automatic shell, was of cylindrical form, eighteen feet in length and four feet in diameter. The forward end was conical and not solid, being formed {{of a number of}} <b>flat</b> <b>steel</b> rings, decreasing in size as they approached the point of the cone. When not in operation these rings did not touch one another, but they could be forced together by pressure on the point of the cone. This shell might contain explosives or not, as might be considered desirable, and it was not intended to fire it from a cannon, but to start it on its course from a long semi-cylindrical trough, which would be used simply to give it the desired direction. After it had been started by a ram worked by an engine at the rear end of the trough, it immediately bean to propel itself by means of the mechanism contained within it.|$|E

6000|$|I was at Sligo when I {{received}} a letter from John O'Leary, saying that I could do no more in Dublin, for even the younger men had turned against me, were [...] "jealous," [...] his letter said, though what they had to be jealous of God knows. He said further that it was all my own fault, that he had warned me what would happen if I lived on terms of intimacy with those I tried to influence. I should have kept myself apart and alone. It was all true; through some influence from an earlier generation, from Walt Whitman, perhaps, I had sat talking in public bars, had talked late into the night at many men's houses, showing all my convictions to men that were but ready for one, and used conversation to explore and discover among men who looked for authority. I did not yet know that intellectual freedom and social equality are incompatible; and yet, if I had, could hardly have lived otherwise, being too young for silence. The trouble came from half a dozen obscure young men, who having nothing to do attended every meeting and were able to overturn a project, that seemed my only bridge to other projects, including a travelling theatre. We had planned small libraries of Irish literature in connection with our country branches; we collected books and money, sending a lecturer to every branch and taking half the proceeds of that lecture to buy books. Maud Gonne, whose beauty could draw a great audience in any country town, had been the lecturer. The scheme was very nearly self-supporting, and six or seven bundles of books, chosen after much disputation by John O'Leary, J. F. Taylor, and myself, had been despatched to some six or seven branches. [...] "The country will support this work" [...] Taylor had said somewhere on some public platform, [...] "because we are the most inflammable people on God's earth," [...] his harsh voice giving almost a quality of style to Carlylian commonplace; but we are also a very jealous people. The half-a-dozen young men, if a little jealous of me, were still more jealous of those country branches which were getting so much notice, and where there was so much of that peasant mind their schoolmasters had taught them to despise. One must be English or Irish, they would have said. I returned to find a great box of books appropriated for some Dublin purpose and the whole scheme abandoned. I know that it was a bitter moment because I remember with gratitude words spoken not to my ear, but for my ear, by a young man who had lately joined our Society, Mr. Stephen McKenna, now well-known amongst scholars for his distinguished translations of Plotinus, and I seem to remember that I lost through anger what gift of persuasion I may possess, and that I was all the more helpless because I felt that even the best of us disagreed about everything at heart. I began to feel that I needed a hostess more than a society, but that I was not to find for years to come. I tried to persuade Maud Gonne to be that hostess, but her social life was in Paris, and she had already formed a new ambition, the turning of French public opinion against England. Without intellectual freedom there can be no agreement, and in Nationalist Dublin there was not--indeed there still is not--any society where a man is heard by the right ears, but never overheard by the wrong, and where he speaks his whole mind gaily, and is not the cautious husband of a part; where phantasy can play before matured into conviction; where life can shine and ring, and lack utility. Mere life lacking the protection of wealth or rank, or some beauty's privilege of caprice cannot choose its company, taking up and dropping men merely because it likes, or dislikes, their manners and their looks, and in its stead opinion crushes and rends, and all is hatred and bitterness: wheel biting upon wheel, a roar of steel or iron tackle, a mill of argument grinding all things down to mediocrity. If, as I think, minds and metals correspond the goldsmiths of Paris foretold the French Revolution when they substituted steel for that unserviceable gold in the manufacture of the more expensive jewel work, and made those large, <b>flat</b> <b>steel</b> buttons for men of fashion whereby the card players were able to cheat by studying the reflections of the cards.|$|E
