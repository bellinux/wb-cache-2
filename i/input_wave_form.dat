40|$|The {{mathematical}} model and test results {{developed for the}} Vertically Reciprocating Auger (VRA) are summarized. The VRA is a device capable of transporting cuttings that result from below surface drilling. It was developed chiefly for the lunar surface, where conventional fluid flushing while drilling would not be practical. The VRA uses only reciprocating motion and transports material through reflections with the surface above. Particles are reflected forward and land ahead of radially placed fences, which prevent the particles from rolling back down the auger. Three <b>input</b> <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> are considered to drive the auger. A modified sawtooth <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> was chosen for testing, over a modified square wave or sine wave, due to its simplicity and effectiveness. The three-dimensional {{mathematical model}} predicted a sand throughput rate of 0. 2667 pounds/stroke, while the actual test setup transported 0. 075 pounds/stroke. Based on this result, a correction factor of 0. 281 is suggested for a modified sawtooth input...|$|R

40|$|Time {{reversal}} is {{the process}} that a response signal recorded at a receiver location is reversed in time and emitted {{back to the original}} source transducer. In the absence of any damage, theoretically the main wave packet of the reconstructed signal could exactly resemble the original <b>input</b> <b>wave</b> <b>form.</b> However, since the amplitude response of Lamb wave mode is generally frequency dependent, the reconstruction is not perfect. In this study, the influences of the frequency-dependent amplitude to the spectrum of the reconstructed signal is investigated. The results show that the peak frequency shifts and the bandwidth varies due to the frequency dependency of amplitude. This spectrum distortion affects the wave form of the main wave packet of the reconstructed signal significantly. Since the baseline-free damage detection is accomplished by comparing the wave form of the TR reconstructed signal with that of the original input signal, these effects would be captured by the damage index and be attributed to the presence of damage. Thus a false alarm may arise. To mitigate these effects, an amplitude modification strategy is established, and an experiment example is introduced to illustrate its process. With the application of this strategy, the modified baseline-free damage detection method is then employed for monitoring the growth of damage...|$|E

Its ability to deposit various types of materials on a substrate in certain patterns makes it a very versatile technology. Though the performance criteria imposed by today's applications are quite tight already, future performance requirements {{will be even more}} challenging. At the same time, several operational issues such as residual vibrations and cross-talk limit the attainable performance of inkjet printheads. Current research efforts focus mainly on a mechanical redesign of current printheads to overcome these operational issues. In this research, however, it has been proposed to fully exploit the mechatronic character of an inkjet printhead: the use of a systems and control approach has been investigated to break these boundaries. To that purpose, a model of an inkjet printhead based on bilaterally coupled multiports has been derived that provides an excellent starting point for the control purpose in mind. It has been shown that by the use of lifted Iterative Learning Control based on the obtained model, <b>input</b> <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> can be designed that damp the residual vibrations after droplet ejection and minimize the effects of cross-talk. Consequently, the performance of inkjet printheads in terms of drop-consistency and attainable jetting frequencies is improved considerably.

The typical shape of Doppler flow <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> is physiologically known to be largely determined by both peripheral resistance and elastic properties of the arterial wall. In the present study we systematically investigate the influence of both vessel wall elasticity and peripheral resistance on the flow <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> obtained from a CFD-simulation of blood flow in the carotid bifurcation. Numerical results are compared to in vivo ultrasound measurements. The in vivo measurement provides a realistic geometry, local elasticities and an <b>input</b> flow <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> for the numerical experiment. Numerical and experimental results are compared at three different sites in the carotid branches. Peripheral resistance has a profoundly decreasing effect on velocities in the external carotid artery. If elasticity is taken into account, the computed peak systolic velocities are considerably lower and a more realistic smoothing of the flow <b>wave</b> <b>form</b> is found.

Here, we follow Chua's approach, that models for i-v characteristics are devoid of predictive power and that instead a memristor model should be expressed in terms of electric flux φ and total charge q only-independent of any specific driving input. Accordingly, Chua's constitutive memristor relations are constructed explicitly for Williams' famous TiO 2 device in terms of q=q(φ).

The device vibrates at two steady states: a high state when the combination resonance is activated and a low state when no resonance is activated. These vibration states are assigned to logical value 1 or 0 to realize the logic gates. Using ac signals to drive the resonator and to execute the logic inputs unifies the <b>input</b> and output <b>wave</b> <b>forms</b> of the logic device, thereby opening the possibility for cascading among logic devices.

A selection of new analyses and physical predictions will be given for experimental geometries when the illuminating field has structure on multiple spatial scale-lengths. Weierstrass fractal illumination Berry's seminal work from over three decades ago [1] established that plane waves scattering from infinitely-wide complex objects (e. g., a transparent mask with a random fractal phase modulation) may acquire fractal characteristics in their statistics. Here, we consider the diametrically-opposing paradigm in complexity: the diffraction of a fractal wave from a simple object. We report on very recent research results concerning the scattering of fractal light from simple apertures. Attention is paid to two classic configurations that underpin both theoretical and experimental studies of diffraction: (i) a single infinite edge, and (ii) a single infinite slit. Classic analyses consider normally-incident plane-wave illumination, and the corresponding diffraction patterns are well known. The novelty of our approach lies in accommodating an incident optical field that possesses a very broad spatial bandwidth (i. e., a waveform whose spatial spectrum extends over decimal orders of pattern scale-length).

It was also found that under the same void ratio and confining pressure, the G 0 value of saturated sand is about 7 – 10 % lower than that for dry sand, and that the effect of the sample preparation method is coupled with the test method in the evaluation of the G 0 values...|$|R
