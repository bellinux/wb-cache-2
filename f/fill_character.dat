50|$|In {{computer}} terminology, a <b>fill</b> <b>character</b> is {{a character}} transmitted solely {{for the purpose of}} consuming time. It does this by filling a timeslot on a data transmission line which would otherwise be forced to be idle (empty). In this way, fill characters provide a simple way of timing required idle times.|$|E
5000|$|In its strictest definition, fill {{characters}} cause {{no action}} {{to be performed}} at all; they simply consume time. The ASCII [...] "null" [...] character is commonly used for this purpose. In actual practice with printers, though, one of the time slots that would otherwise contain a <b>fill</b> <b>character</b> was usually used to contain the [...] "line-feed" [...] character that caused the paper to advance by one line. For some printers (such as teleprinters), this was all the [...] "filling" [...] that was needed.|$|E
50|$|Code 0 (ASCII {{code name}} NUL) {{is a special}} case. In paper tape, {{it is the case}} when there are no holes. It is {{convenient}} to treat this as a <b>fill</b> <b>character</b> with no meaning otherwise. Since the position of a NUL character has no holes punched, it can be replaced with any other character at a later time, so it was typically used to reserve space, either for correcting errors or for inserting information that would be available at a later time or in another place. In computing it is often used for padding in fixed length records and more commonly, to mark the end of a string.|$|E
5000|$|As {{described}} above, printers commonly required <b>fill</b> <b>characters</b> {{when the}} carriage {{was returned to}} the left margin. With other equipment, <b>fill</b> <b>characters</b> were occasionally required in other circumstances. For example the VT05 video terminal sometimes required <b>fill</b> <b>characters</b> when a [...] "scroll up" [...] operation was performed; the process of shuffling data in the shift register memory of the VT05 was slow.|$|R
50|$|The VT05's {{dynamic storage}} was a PMOS shift register; the delays {{associated}} with manipulating {{the data in}} the shift register resulted in the VT05 requiring <b>fill</b> <b>characters</b> after each line feed (as compared to contemporaneous hard copy terminals which required <b>fill</b> <b>characters</b> after each carriage return).|$|R
50|$|In {{a similar}} fashion, {{communications}} protocols often require <b>fill</b> <b>characters</b> at points when processing must be performed.|$|R
40|$|To {{support the}} Standard Identifier {{searches}} {{defined in the}} Z Texas and Bath Profiles, indexing the following MARC 21 fields and subfields is recommended. The two right columns include information from MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data: National Level Record [...] -Bibliographic: Full Level & Minimal Level. K y to the values in the columns: A — Mandatory if applicable. A data element that must be presentin a bibliographic record if it is appropriate for the item being described and if the bibliographic information is available. M — Mandatory. A data element that must be present in every bibliographic record. The <b>fill</b> <b>character</b> (|) is not permitted in mandatory data elements. O — Optional. An optional data element is not required in a bibliographic record, but may be present if desired. [] — Indicates fields and subfields that are now obsolete, but still appear in older records. The mark ". signifies that the data element does not form part of the minimal level record requirements group. Data elements marked with ". " in the minimal level column are effectively optional and {{may be used in}} minimal level records...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Fill</b> <b>characters</b> {{are usually}} used in {{response}} to some real-world limitation. For example, mechanical computer printers such as the earliest dot matrix printers may {{have been able to}} print 30 characters per second, but when a [...] "carriage return" [...] character was received and the printhead began returning to the left margin, there was a noticeable delay before the printing of the next line could begin. Unlike modern printers, these early printers contained essentially no buffering, nor did they do any handshaking, so there would be no place to store the characters which would be received while the printhead {{was in the process of}} returning to the left margin, nor any way to tell the sender to temporarily stop transmitting characters. Instead, one or more <b>fill</b> <b>characters</b> would be transmitted to cover this time.|$|R
50|$|The {{terminal}} only supported forward scrolling {{and direct}} cursor addressing; no fancier editing functions were supported. No special character renditions (such as blinking, bolding, underlining, or reverse video) were supported. The VT05 supported asynchronous communication at baud rates up to 2400 {{bits per second}} (although <b>fill</b> <b>characters</b> were required above 300 bits per second).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new, high-speed contourfill method for alpha-numeric and Japanese Kanji characters developed to generate digital bitmap image (binary image) patterns from contour lines. The contour lines are expressed by Freeman's chain code. We call this method the Improved Edge-flag method. The speed {{of this method}} is increased by using an edge-flag list which stores the coordinates of the edge-flag pixels. A comparison of two conventional contour-fill methods with our method shows that OLI~S is about 4 - 8 times faster in <b>filling</b> <b>character</b> contours. 1...|$|R
50|$|The DECwriter LA30 was a 30 character/second {{dot matrix}} {{printing}} terminal introduced in 1970 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) of Maynard, Massachusetts. It printed 80 columns of uppercase-only 7×5 dot matrix characters across a unique-sized paper. The printhead {{was driven by}} a stepper motor and the paper was advanced by a noisy solenoid ratchet drive. The LA30 was available with both a parallel interface (LA30-P) and a serial interface (LA30-S); however, the serial LA30 required the use of <b>fill</b> <b>characters</b> during the carriage-return. In 1972, a receive-only variation named LA30A became available as well.|$|R

50|$|The VT50 {{supported}} {{asynchronous communication}} at baud rates up to 9600 {{bits per second}} and did not require any <b>fill</b> <b>characters.</b> Like other early DEC terminals, the VT50 series were equipped with both an RS-232 port {{as well as a}} 20mA current loop, an older serial standard used with teletype machines that was more suitable to long-distance transmission over phone lines. Data was read into a small buffer, which the display hardware periodically read to produce the display. Characters typed on the keyboard were likewise stored in a buffer and sent over the serial line as quickly as possible.|$|R

5000|$|Lineages {{of ritual}} masters ( [...] fashi), also {{referred}} to as practitioners of [...] "Faism", also called [...] "Folk Taoism" [...] or (in southeast China) [...] "Red Taoism", operate within the Chinese folk religion but outside any institution of official Taoism. The ritual masters, who have the same role of the sanju daoshi within the fabric of society, aren't considered Taoist priests by the daoshi of Taoism who trace their lineage to the Celestial Masters and by Taoists officially registered with the state Taoist Church. Fashi are defined as of [...] "kataphatic" [...] (<b>filling)</b> <b>character</b> in opposition to professional Taoists who are [...] "kenotic" [...] (of emptying, or apophatic, character).|$|R
