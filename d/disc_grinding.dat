40|$|AbstractModern {{technological}} processes make {{it possible}} to produce high strength steel with up to 1200  MPa yield strength. This high yield strength gives potential for considerable improvements in performance and reduction in weight, which are of increasing importance in the transport sector and in vehicles used in the construction industry. However, data found in literature show that welded structural parts using these high and ultra-high strength steels have a fatigue resistance not very different in comparison with those obtained in conventional steels with a much lower yield stress. In this work a fatigue study was performed in a high strength steel in order to evaluate the influence on fatigue strength of the following factors: stress concentration at weld toe, internal defects and welding process method. The material used in this study was a steel sheet called DOMEX 600 DC from SSAB with 5  mm of thickness. This is a high strength steel with a yield stress of 670  MPa and a tensile strength of about 750  MPa. Butt welded specimens using MAG welding process were submitted to cyclic loading in servo hydraulic machine. Three welding conditions of transverse butt joints and base material were investigated in this fatigue study: as welded; welds overfill removed by grinding; welds overfill and first weld root removed by grinding. The overfill removing by grinding promotes a significant improvement of the fatigue resistance in comparison with the as welded condition. The removing of the root of the first weld by <b>disc</b> <b>grinding</b> improves significantly the weld quality by reducing the level of internal defects, leading to a further increasing on fatigue strength close to the parent material. The comparison of characteristic curves obtained for each welding condition and the fatigue class (FAT) indicates that, in general, fatigue strength of DOMEX 600 DC steel is significantly higher than fatigue strength recommended by IIW for conventional steels. The higher difference was found for welds with overfill removed and the first weld root submitted to a <b>disc</b> <b>grinding</b> operation...|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{quantity}} of metallic contaminants extracted from grinded millet was evaluated. The millet was grinded in three different forms; wet, paste, and dry forms for up to 3 minutes using locally fabricated grinding machine with cast <b>grinding</b> <b>discs.</b> Separate <b>grinding</b> <b>discs</b> were used for different millet forms, while the same quantity of millet, 1 kg, was used throughout the experiments. The millet was soaked for 24 hours before grinding {{in order to obtain}} wet and paste forms of the millet. Metallic contaminants were carefully extracted from the grinded millet using magnetic bed along with sedimentation and decantation. The extracted materials were then quantified to ascertain the food form that produces the highest amount of metallic contaminants.

It was concluded that hard <b>disc</b> <b>grinding</b> required during manufacture resulted in percutaneous implantation of small glass particles, leading to chronic synovitis and effusion. Case history A 25 -year-old boat builder developed painless swel-ling at the anterior aspect of the left knee in mid 1981. A diagnosis of prepatellar bursitis was made in November 1981. The swelling resolved several months later but recurred intermittently thereafter. In February 1982 he developed swelling of the dor-sum of the right hand, which persisted until assess-ment in August 1982. He complained of pain on initial movement of the hand, but suffered no func-tional impairment. There was no history of significant back pain or other joint abnormality. For the preced-ing five years he had been working extensively with glass fibres in the manufacture of surfboards. During this period he had been troubled by nasal obstruction in spite of regular use of a mask. Several nasal polyps were removed by cautery in August 1981, and radiographic assessment in Octrober 1981 revealed mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses and swel-ling of the nasal turbinates. He had been troubled intermittently by skin irritation, occurring predomin-antly in hot weather. A maculopapular rash had been observed which involved, at various times, the hands, feet, arms, legs, and trunk.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop and implement a methodology for modeling complex grinding processes and finding optimal process conditions to meet a general class of process requirements. In order to achieve these goals, novel modeling schemes and optimization methods based on fuzzy logic, neural networks, and evolutionary algorithms (EA) are developed. ^ A hierarchical structure which consists of radial basis function networks (RBFN), fuzzy basis function networks (FBFN), and analytical equations is proposed to construct a comprehensive model of the grinding process. Two new algorithms, orthogonal least-squares learning using genetic algorithm (OLSGA) and adaptive least-squares (ALS) algorithm, based on the least-squares method and genetic algorithm (GA), are proposed for autonomous learning and construction of RBFN 2 ̆ 7 s and FBFN 2 ̆ 7 s, respectively. ^ The first approach taken in this study for optimization of a grinding processes is based on the improved fuzzy rule-based optimization scheme in the generalized intelligent grinding advisory system (GIGAS). Next, a new approach based on model-based optimization scheme is also proposed in order to deal with a more general class of grinding optimization problems. Since grinding optimization can be considered as constrained nonlinear optimization problems with mixed-integer variables and time-varying characteristics, a novel algorithm based on the evolution strategies (ES) is proposed as a solution-finding method. ^ The proposed modelling scheme is first applied to process control of a <b>disc</b> <b>grinding</b> process in the computer industry. A model for the material removal rate is constructed using the process data collected from the actual operation, and an adaptive controller based on the model is designed and implemented to achieve the required dimensional accuracy of ground parts. The potential improvement of process capability via adaptive control is demonstrated. Next, to implement the model-based optimization scheme for surface grinding processes, process models for grinding force, power, surface roughness, and residual stress are developed through designed experiments. Case studies are performed to demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of the proposed optimization method with various optimization objectives including minimization of grinding cost, minimization of cycle time, and process control. Finally, the optimal process conditions determined by the optimization scheme are validated by experimental results. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} planet {{formation}} offers {{a rich source}} of dust production via grain growth in protostellar <b>discs,</b> and via <b>grinding</b> of larger bodies in debris disc systems. Chemical evolution models, designed to follow the build up of metals and dust in galaxies, do not currently account for planet formation. We consider the possibility that the apparent under-prediction of dust mass in high redshift galaxies by chemical evolution models could be in part, due to these models neglecting this process, specifically due to their assumption that a large fraction of the dust mass is removed from the interstellar medium during star formation (so-called astration). By adding a planet formation phase into galaxy chemical evolution, we demonstrate that the dust budget crisis can be partially ameliorated by a factor of 1. 3 - 1. 5 only if a) circumstellar discs prevent a large fraction of the dust mass entering the star during its birth, and b) that dust mass is preferentially liberated via jets, winds and outflows rather than accreted into planetary-mass bodies.

Morphologies of substrates and coatings, crystal structure, thickness and mechanical properties of coatings were investigated using optical microscope, AFM, XRD, CSM scratch tester and tribometer. It was shown that surface morphology of cathodic arc TiAlN coating was mainly affected by the morphology of the substrate surface and the coating growth process. The influence of substrate roughness on crystal structure and thickness of the coatings could be ignored. With the decreasing of the substrate roughness, the adhesion force between coating and substrate increased. Three stresses model was applied to interpret this result. The wear resistance of the coating was also improved with decreasing the substrate roughness. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Paper {{deals with}} {{possibilities}} {{of using the}} <b>grinding</b> <b>discs</b> with abrasive grains of electrocorundum, sintered corundum and its mixture, cubic boron nitride and diamond, in tools production. Tools are compared according {{to the influence of}} technological conditions on the cutting forces and the surface quality. It is described by arithmetic roughness. E 335 GC (11600), X 20 Cr 1 3 (19436) a 102 Cr 6 (14109) materials were machined in hardened and non-hardened condition. Abrasive (grinding) material affects the size of the cutting forces and thus flexibility of technological system and the repeatability of products. High cutting forces are generated when using sintered corundum, and white electrocorundum. Due to the geometry of the abrasive grain is more advantageous to use diamond or cubic boron nitride material. The porosity of the grinding wheel also affects the resulting machine tool load and technological areas. The greater the porosity is, the lower the value of cutting forces is. Unfortunately, with the porosity increases significantly an average roughness. These grinding wheels are suitable for roughing. The higher value of porosity ensures colder cut and smaller heat affected surfaces. Surface quality, while maintaining other process conditions are best when using white electrocorundum, slightly is impaired for other abrasive materials. However, the results are not statistically significant...|$|R
40|$|The purpose: to {{determine}} the most effective method and sequence of polishing systems to achieve the effect of «dry light» of the final restoration ofthevestibular surface of the incisors and molars chewing surface of the hybrid light-cured composite materials. Material and methods. Material for polishing for the restoration divided into three groups: 1. <b>Grinding</b> <b>discs</b> — firm TOR VM with three types of grit: coarse, medium, soft and super soft, firm 3 M ESPE «Sof-Lex» ultrafine polishing wheels and contoured 2. Silicone heads — polished Enhens, Dentsply, polishers EVE. 3. Polishing brushes Jiffy Regular Brushes, Ultradent; nylon brush prevention. Results. The best way {{to give effect to}} the «dry light» was the next sequence of the materials: polished Enhens, Dentsply, ultrafine polishing wheels of orange and yellow 3 M ESPE «Sof-Lex», polishing brush Jiffy Regular Brushes, Ultradent. The best effect of polishing brushes obtained by using it in complex with polishing paste. Polishing process with all of the materials was performed with water. Conclusion: When polishing the vestibular surface of incisors and the occlusal surface of molars it is necessary to consider the saving of macrorelief of restoration or the need to remove excess material, without affecting areas of natural tooth tissue, which should be used or exclude certain types of abrasive polishing materials...|$|R
5000|$|The Murumuru palm (Astrocaryum murumuru) is {{abundant}} in the Brazilian Amazon, extending to the borders of Bolivia and Peru. It prefers to grow in periodically flooded areas, especially on islands and in lowlands along the rivers throughout the Amazon River estuary and its tributaries, in dense or semi-open forests.It is also frequently found in the lowlands of Marajo Island. The stem, leaves and fruit stalks are covered with hard, black spines that can reach over 20 cm in length, complicating fruit harvesting. When the fruit is ripe, the inflorescence (cluster of flowers) drops to the ground. The fruit contains a yellow flesh often consumed by rodents as food, which leave the seeds clean. The seed’s hard shell is only separable from the kernel when dry. In general, 100 kg of dry seeds (12%- 15% water) yields 27 kg to 29 kg of kernels, which must be further dried to prevent deterioration during storage. These kernels then yield 40% to 42% oil. A single Murumuru palm produces about 11 kg of dry seeds. Hydraulic extraction can produce 35% oil relative to the dry weight of the kernel, which is equivalent to about 3.8 liters of oil per Murumuru palm. The kernels must be ground with <b>grinding</b> <b>discs</b> before hydraulic extraction. A kilogram of fruit pulp contains approximately 50 seeds. Seed germination is moderate and growth {{in the field is}} slow[...]|$|R
