60|$|THE DEAN. <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Stephen; absolutely, entirely disagree.|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> You must excuse me, but I do; {{and so does}} Dr. Tempest. We {{think that}} you have been a little too much in a hurry since he communicated to you the result of our first meeting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I have; {{but that}} has nothing to do with it. You spoke of Mr. Finn as though he would be guilty of some crime were he to ask Violet Effingham to be his wife. In that <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> Mr. Finn is--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; <b>I</b> must <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> am not {{responsible}} for the disaster that overtook your herd. Furthermore, doubly to assure you, write to the State Veterinary {{as to whether or not}} my place is free of cholera.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{situation}} is, indeed, serious," [...] Mr. Calvin said to Ernest. [...] "I [...] {{have little}} quarrel <b>with</b> the way <b>you</b> have depicted it. Only <b>I</b> [...] <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> about the doom {{of the middle}} class. We shall [...] survive, and we shall overthrow the trusts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{a bit of}} it! He's {{been out}} after eight per cent. since the beginning. Eight per cent.! He'll come a cropper one of these days, if you ask me. He's been near it once or twice already. That's got his nerves to rags. I suppose we're all human beings really, but what price the sacred Institution of the Family! Us as a bundle! Eh?... <b>I</b> don't half <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Vee, really; only thing is, I don't see how you're going to pull it off. A home MAY {{be a sort of}} cage, but still--it's a home. Gives you a right to hang on to the old man until he busts--practically. Jolly hard life for a girl, getting a living. Not MY affair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, there, Mr. Tyrrwhit, I {{can only}} say, that <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> I must express {{my opinion that}} if you {{endeavor}} to recover your money on that plea you will be beaten. If you can prove fraud of that kind, no doubt you can punish {{those who have been}} guilty of it,--me among the number." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{may seem}} right to you, mother, {{but it seems}} wrong to me. I do not {{understand}} why <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> and with most of my people, {{but there is something}} inside of me which, I think, is not me. It tells me not to do many things that I want to do, and sometimes bids me go forward when I wish to draw back. What it is I cannot tell, but I must not disobey it, I will not disobey it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{need not}} say, Tallente, that <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> entirely," [...] his {{companion}} declared. [...] "At the same time, I {{am not going}} to argue with you. To tell you the truth, I spent a great part of last night with you in my thoughts. We cannot afford to let you go. Supposing, now, that I could induce Watkinson to give up Kendal? His seat is quite safe and with a little reshuffling you would be able to slip back gradually to your place amongst us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{the widow}} {{goes to her}} {{cupboard}} and finds it bare," [...] Richard answered, [...] "her spiritual outlook we may admit will be affected. If I may pick holes in your philosophy, Miss Vinrace, which has its merits, I would point out that a human being is not a set of compartments, but an organism. Imagination, Miss Vinrace; use your imagination; that's where you young Liberals fail. Conceive {{the world as a}} whole. Now for your second point; when you assert that in trying to set the house in order {{for the benefit of the}} young generation I am wasting my higher capabilities, <b>I</b> totally <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> can conceive no more exalted aim--to be the citizen of the Empire. Look at it in this way, Miss Vinrace; conceive the state as a complicated machine; we citizens are parts of that machine; some fulfil more important duties; others (perhaps I am one of them) serve only to connect some obscure parts of the mechanism, concealed from the public eye. Yet if the meanest screw fails in its task, the proper working of the whole is imperilled." ...|$|R
6000|$|With {{regard to}} the 'House of Clouds'[84] <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> both <b>with</b> <b>you</b> and Miss Mitford, {{thinking}} it, comparatively with my other poems, neither so bad nor so good as you two account it. It has certainly been singled out for great praise {{both at home and}} abroad, and only the other day Mr. Horne wrote to me to reproach me for not having mentioned it to him, because he came upon it accidentally and considered it 'one of my best productions.' Mr. Kenyon holds the same opinion. As for Flush's verses, they are what I call cobweb verses, thin and light enough; and Arabel was mistaken in telling you that Miss Mitford gave the prize to them. Her words were, 'They are as tender and true as anything you ever wrote, but nothing is equal to the [...] "House of Clouds."' Those were her words, or to that effect, and I refer to them to you, not for the sake of Flush's verses, which really do not appear even to myself, their writer, worth a defence, but for the sake of your judgment of her accuracy in judging.|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides, though LA GUERRE has his faults, I'll allow He's one of {{the bravest}} of men: My goodness! if <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> him now, <b>I</b> might <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> him then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> altogether;--but I {{especially}} {{disagree with}} you as you are speaking about my mother, and about a lady who is to become your own mother-in-law. I trust that you will make such efforts, and that you will make them successfully. Lady Aylmer is not a woman who will give you her heart at once, simply because you have become her son's wife. She will judge you by your own qualities, and will not scruple to condemn you should she see cause." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{may call}} it {{so if you}} will. If you think that Augustus was {{to have it all}} his own way, <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> altogether. In point of fact, your nephew behaved through the whole of that matter as well as a man could do. Practically, he told no lie at all. He did just what a man ought to do, and {{anything}} that you have heard to the contrary is calumnious and false. As I am told that you have been led by my brother's statement to disinherit your nephew--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It shall all be made {{right in}} the morning," [...] said his wife. [...] "But {{are you sure you}} did not take {{anything}} that <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> while you were away?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Never seek {{to censor}} or cut {{yourself}} off from dissent; always respect {{the right of}} others to <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Do not indoctrinate your children. Teach {{them how}} to think for themselves, how to {{evaluate}} evidence, and how to <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|What fun {{you three}} must be having! I hope the cold don't <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> - <b>I</b> remain, my dear mother, your affectionate son, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But wait," [...] Paula urged. [...] "It's his {{conclusions}} and methods and processes. Also, there he <b>disagrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Aaron, fundamentally. He quoted Pater's 'that all art aspires toward music'--" ...|$|R
60|$|He is {{at least}} a good man, even if he does <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> on {{political}} and industrial problems. And heaven knows that good men are rare enough these days.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Christianity Today Barclay explains, [...] "So while <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> the New Perspective in its sidelining grace within Paul’s thought, I agree with its emphasis that Paul was fundamentally concerned with creating new communities that crossed ethnic and social boundaries." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If I were to vocalise my {{complete}} {{support to}} them State, I {{would get in}} trouble... If I was to say that I don't support them at all, that would be untrue... I may support them on certain issues, while <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> them in other issues." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I can <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> your opinion, {{it turns}} out,” she says, “but <b>I</b> can’t <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> your experience.” ...|$|R
5000|$|James Cameron emphatically denied Ellison's {{allegations}} and {{was opposed to}} the settlement, stating [...] "For legal reasons I'm not suppose sic {{to comment on that}} (the addition of acknowledgement credits) but it was a real bum deal, I had nothing to do <b>with</b> it and <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> you," [...] the Bishop interposed, his pale, ascetic face betraying by a faint glow the {{intensity}} of his feelings. [...] "Your premise is wrong. There {{is no such thing}} as a conflict of interest between labor and capital--or, rather, there ought not to be." ...|$|R
5000|$|On November 22, 1963, Connally {{was seriously}} wounded while riding in President Kennedy's car at Dealey Plaza in Dallas when the {{president}} was assassinated. He recovered from wounds in his chest, wrist and thigh. The ten-month investigation by the Warren Commission of 1963-64 concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by 24 year old ex-marine Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. Connally did not dispute this conclusion but did {{for the rest of}} his life question the single bullet theory. In 1966, he told the press, [...] "I am convinced beyond any doubt that I was not struck by the first bullet," [...] and added, [...] "but just because <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> the Warren Commission on this one finding does not mean <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> their overall findings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You ate {{something}} that <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> last night, didn't you?" [...] I said, {{by way of}} giving {{him a chance to}} slide out of it if he wanted to. But he wouldn't have it, at any price.|$|R
40|$|William Peone {{was born}} about 1806 or earlier, his father's name was William "Sea-al " Peone, a French-Canadian, {{and his mother}} Quichinemalese of the Spokane tribe. Some writers give his parents as Louis Pion and Okanagan Native Mary "Sukomelk, ” <b>I</b> <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> them. You’ll see why I do later in this piece...|$|R
5000|$|... "Just because I’m third doesn’t mean I need {{to sign on}} {{with one}} of them," [...] Francis said on the Monday after the Saturday special election. [...] "When {{you look at the}} voting record and history of Dardenne and Heitmeier, they are very similar. <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> term-limited {{senators}} running for this office." ...|$|R
5000|$|A frightened {{man came}} to the KGB. [...] "My talking parrot has disappeared." [...] "That's {{not the kind of}} case we handle. Go to the {{criminal}} police." [...] 'Excuse me, of course I know that I must go to them. I am here just to tell <b>you</b> officially that <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> the parrot." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "This is a sobering, intelligent, {{controversial}} {{examination of}} the role lawyers play in the national economy. Although <b>I</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> some of the authors’ assumptions and conclusions, the brilliance of their analyses cannot be disputed."—Thomas A. Mesereau, Jr., Partner, Mesereau & Yu, LLP, Los Angeles; the lawyer who won the Michael Jackson criminal case ...|$|R
50|$|Asking a {{question}} that implies one clear answer is to put others in a difficult position. If they <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> then they risk conflict or derision. In particular if you state the question with certainty, then it makes disagreement seem rude.|$|R
40|$|The new BBC {{director}} general Tony Hall {{barely had time}} to arrange the pens on his new desk before two hot potatoes landed on it. <b>I</b> <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> his decision on the Wizard of Oz protest song and, you may not be surprised to hear, <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> the line taken on the LSE’s complaints about the BBC Panorama North Korea film. But politically, he may well have done the right thing...|$|R
5000|$|Nicholas D. Kristof welcomed Sexants in the New York Times as [...] "sensibly {{organized}} and engagingly told" [...] but [...] "In the end, <b>I</b> <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> {{much of the}} thesis of this book, {{but that is not}} to say that I disliked it. On the contrary, I probably liked it more for <b>disagreeing</b> <b>with</b> it. Partly because of the boldness of the argument, it is stimulating and refreshing..." ...|$|R
500|$|The film {{generated}} a huge {{reaction in the}} blogosphere. One comment to The Guardian read: [...] "To suggest that people who <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> deserve to die is incredibly stupid. Imagine if some Christian group in the US did that to gays, Muslims or anyone else they <b>disagree</b> <b>with.</b> The outrage would be palpable. And deserved." ...|$|R
5000|$|In June 2012, CEO of Foxconn Terry Gou {{stated that}} he had [...] "great esteem for Japanese (businessmen), {{especially}} those {{who are able to}} <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> in person and not stab you in the back, unlike the Gaoli bangzi (a racial slur for Koreans)", sparking controversy.|$|R
