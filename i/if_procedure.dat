The data examined were collected from interviews with 1, 333 African American and white hospital inpatients with known coronary disease admitted to the Birmingham-Black Health Seeking for Coronary Heart Disease Project (1989 - 1990) in Alabama.

3000|$|Like the DR, {{a measure}} of true {{empirical}} discriminability also makes use of the HR and FAR computed from IDs made to suspects in the lineup. Again, it often seems insufficient to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a lineup using a measure that includes only the HR and the FAR, which leaves out any consideration of filler IDs from target-present and target-absent lineups. However, unlike a filler, an innocent suspect is not known to be innocent and will be imperiled (and perhaps wrongfully convicted) if mistakenly identified. For that reason, a reasonable goal for the police is to maximize the HR while simultaneously minimizing the FAR (values that are computed using only suspect IDs), regardless of the rate of filler IDs. For example, <b>if</b> <b>Procedure</b> A yielded a HR of [...]. 80 and a FAR of [...]. 05, whereas Procedure B yielded a HR of [...]. 60 and a FAR of [...]. 20, {{it would be difficult}} to defend the argument that the police should use Procedure B based on some consideration having to do with the rate of filler IDs vs. no IDs for the two procedures. Instead, Procedure A would clearly be the one to use no matter what the filler ID rate and no ID rate happened to be for either procedure. Moreover, no model of memory would be needed to reinforce the decision as to which of the two procedures is diagnostically superior. On their own, the empirical data would make it crystal clear which procedure is diagnostically superior.|$|E

ObjectivesThis analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of warfarin, NOACs, and LAAC with the Watchman device (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts) for stroke risk reduction in patients with nonvalvular AF at multiple time points over a lifetime horizon. MethodsA Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of LAAC, NOACs, and warfarin {{from the perspective of}} the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services over a lifetime (20 -year) horizon. Patients were 70 years of age and at moderate risk for stroke and bleeding. Clinical event rates, stroke outcomes, and quality of life information were drawn predominantly from PROTECT AF (Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation) 4 -year data and meta-analyses of warfarin and NOACs. Costs for stroke risk reduction therapies, treatment of associated acute events, and long-term care following disabling stroke were presented in 2015 U. S. dollars. ResultsRelative to warfarin, LAAC was cost-effective at 7 years ($ 42, 994 /quality-adjusted life-years [QALY]), and NOACs were cost-effective at 16 years ($ 48, 446 /QALY). LAAC was dominant over NOACs by year 5 and warfarin by year  10. At 10 years, LAAC provided more QALYs than warfarin and NOACs (5. 855 vs. 5. 601 vs. 5. 751, respectively). In sensitivity analyses, LAAC remained cost-effective relative to warfarin ($ 41, 470 /QALY at 11 years) and NOACs ($ 21, 964 /QALY at 10 years), even <b>if</b> <b>procedure</b> costs were doubled. ConclusionsBoth NOACs and LAAC with the Watchman device were cost-effective relative to warfarin, but LAAC was also found to be cost-effective and to offer better value relative to NOACs.

3000|$|The example {{presented}} above {{involved an}} easy choice because Procedure A yielded both a higher HR {{and a lower}} FAR than Procedure B. However, the issue becomes more complicated when the HR and FAR are both higher for one procedure than the other. For example, which procedure would be diagnostically superior <b>if</b> <b>Procedure</b> A yielded a HR of [...]. 80 and a FAR of [...]. 05, whereas Procedure B yielded a HR of [...]. 60 and a FAR of [...]. 02 ? The DR for Procedure B (. 60 /. 02 = 30) is higher than that for Procedure A (. 80 /. 05 = 16), so by that measure Procedure B would be preferred. However, this outcome would not actually identify Procedure B as being diagnostically superior. Why not? In brief, {{the reason is that}} {{it would be easy to}} selectively induce more conservative responding for Procedure A (e.g., using instructions that encourage a high degree of certainty before making an ID from the lineup), thereby lowering both the HR and the FAR for that procedure. Imagine that when conservative responding was encouraged for Procedure A, the HR dropped from [...]. 80 to [...]. 65 (still higher than Procedure B, with a HR of [...]. 60) and the FAR dropped from [...]. 05 to [...]. 02 (now equal to Procedure B). Under these conditions, Procedure A would clearly be the diagnostically superior procedure. Instead of switching from Procedure A to Procedure B to achieve a FAR as low as [...]. 02, it would make more sense to stick with Procedure A and to induce more conservative responding. In essence, that kind of comparison is what ROC analysis is all about, and it illustrates why ROC analysis is needed to unambiguously determine the diagnostically superior procedure.|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine <b>if</b> <b>procedure</b> time or queue position affected the performance characteristics of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for diagnosing solid pancreatic malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study evaluating patients with solid pancreatic lesions in whom EUS-FNA was performed. Three timing variables were evaluated as surrogate markers for endoscopist fatigue: Procedure start times, morning versus afternoon procedures, and endoscopy queue position. Statistical analyses were performed to determine whether the timing variables predicted performance characteristics of EUS-FNA. RESULTS: We identified 609 patients (mean age: 65. 8 years, 52. 1 % males) with solid pancreatic lesions who underwent EUS-FNA. The sensitivity of EUS-FNA was 100 % for procedures that started at 7 AM while cases that started at 4 PM had a sensitivity of 81 %. Using start time on a continuous scale, each elapsed hour was associated with a 1. 9 % decrease in EUS-FNA sensitivity (P = 0. 003). Similarly, a 10 % reduction in EUS-FNA sensitivity was detected between morning and afternoon procedures (92 % vs. 82 % respectively, P = 0. 0006). A linear regression comparing the procedure start time and diagnostic accuracy revealed a decrease of approximately 1. 7 % in procedure accuracy for every hour later a procedure was started. A 16 % reduction in EUS-FNA accuracy was detected between morning and afternoon procedures (100 % vs. 84 % respectively, P = 0. 0009). When the queue position was assessed, a 2. 4 % reduction in accuracy was noted for each increase in the queue position (P = 0. 013). CONCLUSION: Sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA for solid pancreatic lesions decline with progressively later EUS starting times and increasing numbers of procedures before a given EUS, potentially from endoscopist fatigue and cytotechnologist fatigue...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} data accuracy from well test operations. All data measuring methods, except bottomhole and surface PVT sampling, is investigated for the accuracy related to procedure and equipment used. The objectives with {{this study is to}} highlight potential weaknesses in the procedures or equipment so that Expro can improve the quality of their data acquisition. The main research area is the measurement methods, but also the impact of the type of fluids produced has been studied. Oil, gas or gas/condensate may have different inaccuracies for different methods. Results from this study shows that some of the measurements should be improved. The most critical measurement is the oil flow rate, where no procedure for executing meter correction factor is given. Oil flow rate {{is one of the most}} important surface parameters the client want obtain with a well test and should therefor be as accurate as possible. Another weakness is an Excel spreadsheets that is used for various calculations for oil is not protected and formulas has been manipulated. This may again give wrong output values. Another factor is the lack of knowledge among offshore personnell about phase changes due to changes in pressure and temperature. This may have impact on all the measurements that include gas and oil. Since this is something they can not expect offshore personnell to be experts on, should the procedures be updated to cover all scenarios for measurements of various phases. The conclusion from this study is that measurements regarding oil and gas parameter are the most inaccurate and an update of procedures is necessary to improve the data accuracy. Most of the calculations today is done by computer softwares, but correct input values is necessary to get correct output values. Knowledge about what formulas the software contain is important to know to be able to make necessary measurement and data collection for input variables to the software.

30|$|Heavy menstrual {{bleeding}} is {{a common}} presenting complaint and can significantly {{affect the quality of}} life of affected women. The 2007 National Institute for Clinical Excellence guideline on heavy menstrual bleeding states that in women with heavy menstrual bleeding alone, endometrial ablation should be considered preferable to hysterectomy. The choice of the type of endometrial ablation procedure would depend on several factors including the availability of first-, second- or even third-generation endometrial ablation equipment, clinician experience and preference as well as patient choice and <b>if</b> <b>procedure</b> is intended to be performed as an office procedure without the use of general anaesthetic where second- or third-generation endometrial ablation equipment would be used. The number of first-generation endometrial ablation procedures being performed is expected to decrease over time. This is as a result of clinicians’ preference, due to reported higher operative complication rates in some studies, even though a meta-analysis of individual patient data has found it to be as effective as the second-generation techniques for heavy menstrual bleeding. We performed a retrospective clinical audit to investigate the trend from January 1995 to December 2005 in the use of first-generation endometrial ablation techniques performed at a district general hospital in the UK. We found that the general trend is of a rapidly decreasing number of first-generation endometrial ablation procedures being performed. We also found that the operative complication rates are low and similar to rates in the published literature. The long-term hysterectomy rate after first-generation endometrial ablation procedure in our audit population is also low and similar to the rates in the published literature. We conclude from our audit data that first-generation endometrial ablation techniques such as trans-cervical resection of the endometrium for heavy menstrual bleeding are effective and in experienced hands have fairly low operative complication rates and long-term hysterectomy rates. These are similar to rates in the published literature for second-generation endometrial ablation techniques. We recommend that until further larger scale randomised controlled trials comparing first generation and the newer second-generation endometrial ablation techniques are performed which would provide clinicians with better evidence, first-generation endometrial ablation equipment should not yet be condemned to gather dust in hospital storage facilities and become ‘museum pieces’. Rather, a concerted effort must be made to increase training opportunities in the use of first-generation endometrial ablation techniques especially in institutions that have already made the financial investment and are in possession of perfectly functioning equipment. This would ensure that the valuable clinical skill in the use of available first-generation endometrial ablation technique is not lost over time.|$|E
