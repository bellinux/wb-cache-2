40|$|Abstract. A {{non-linear}} mathematical model, for the roll-yaw behaviour of a ship, is used {{to predict}} the prevention of capsize of a small ship. The problem was simulated using the digital package SIMULINK. Simulated responses of the ship with simple <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>fin</b> stabilisers show that capsize {{could have been prevented}} by this means in waves up to 7 m in height. Active control using a simple full span control flap {{is used to}} show a reduction in roll angle to much greater waves. These results are compared to the use of cycloidal propeller propulsion to provide lateral thrust and hence roll control, which showed that this method can also reduce the roll. In order for successful roll reduction with a cycloidal propeller the response time constant is determined. In this example the roll reduction is greater in the fin example but this ability falls off rapidly with forward speed. Roll control using the cycloidal propeller has the advantage of retaining its’ effectiveness at low or zero speeds. To be fully effective for this ship, the reaction time to generate the side thrust from the roll actuation signal must be less than 13 seconds for the cycloidal propeller to prevent capsize. This would imply the use of the cycloidal propeller for roll control is better suited to larger ships...|$|E
50|$|Unlike <b>hydrodynamic</b> roll {{stabilizing}} <b>fins,</b> {{the ship}} gyroscopic stabilizer can only produce a limited roll stabilizing moment {{that may be}} exceeded as the wave height increases. Otherwise, {{it is not unusual}} for the manufacturer to recommend that the unit not be used at sea in large waves.|$|R
40|$|Fin-angle {{feedback}} control is usually used in conventional fin stabilizers, and its actual anti-rolling effect {{is difficult to}} reach theoretical design requirements. Primarily, lift of control torque is a theoretical value calculated by static <b>hydrodynamic</b> characteristics of <b>fin.</b> However, <b>hydrodynamic</b> characteristics of <b>fin</b> are dynamic while fin is moving in waves. As a result, {{there is a large}} deviation between actual value and theoretical value of lift. Firstly, the reasons of deviation are analyzed theoretically, which could avoid a variety of interference factors and complex theoretical derivations. Secondly, a new device is designed for direct measurement of actual lift, which is composed of fin-shaft combined mechanism and sensors. This new device can make fin-shaft not only be the basic function of rotating fin, but also detect actual lift. Through analysis using stiffness matrix of Euler-Bernoulli beam, displacement of shaft-core end is measured instead of lift which is difficult to measure. Then quantitative relationship between lift and displacement is defined. Three main factors are analyzed with quantitative relationship. What is more, two installation modes of sensors and a removable shaft-end cover are proposed according to <b>hydrodynamic</b> characteristics of <b>fin.</b> Thus the new device contributes to maintenance and measurement. Lastly, the effectiveness and accuracy of device are verified by contrasting calculation and simulation on the basis of actual design parameters. And the new measuring lift method can be proved to be effective through experiments. The new device is achieved from conventional fin stabilizers. Accordingly, the reliability of original equipment is inherited. The alteration of fin stabilizers is minor, which is suitable for engineering application. In addition, the flexural properties of fin-shaft are digitized with analysis of stiffness matrix. This method provides theoretical support for engineering application by carrying out finite element analysis with computers...|$|R
5000|$|Most large {{submarines}} {{consist of}} a cylindrical body with hemispherical (or conical) ends and a vertical structure, usually located amidships, which houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes. In modern submarines, this structure is the [...] "sail" [...] in American usage, and [...] "fin" [...] in European usage. A [...] "conning tower" [...] was a feature of earlier designs: a separate pressure hull above {{the main body of}} the boat that allowed the use of shorter periscopes. There is a propeller (or pump jet) at the rear, and various <b>hydrodynamic</b> control <b>fins.</b> Smaller, deep-diving and specialty submarines may deviate significantly from this traditional layout. Submarines use diving planes and also change the amount of water and air in ballast tanks to change buoyancy for submerging and surfacing.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} extract more speed, and endow {{the boat with}} greater high speed stability, in both pitch and yaw, K7 was subtly {{modified}} {{in the second half}} of the 1950s to incorporate more effective streamlining with a blown Perspex cockpit canopy and fluting to the lower part of the main hull. In 1958, a small wedge shaped tail fin, housing an arrester parachute, modified sponson fairings, that gave a significant reduction in forward aerodynamic lift, and a fixed <b>hydrodynamic</b> stabilising <b>fin,</b> attached to the transom to aid directional stability, and exert a marginal down-force on the nose were incorporated into the design to increase the safe operating envelope of the hydroplane. Thus she reached 225 mph in 1956, where an unprecedented peak speed of 286.78 mph was achieved on one run, 239 mph in 1957, 248 mph in 1958 and 260 mph in 1959.|$|R
50|$|Ship {{stabilizing}} gyroscopes are {{a technology}} {{developed in the}} 19th century and early 20th century and used to stabilize roll motions in ocean-going ships. It lost favor in this application to <b>hydrodynamic</b> roll stabilizer <b>fins</b> because of reduced cost and weight. However, more recently (since the 1990s) a growing interest in the device has reemerged for low speed roll stabilization of vessels. Unlike fins, the gyroscope does not rely on the forward speed of the ship to generate a roll stabilizing moment and therefore can stabilize motor yachts while at anchorage.|$|R
50|$|Conventional statics fins {{suffer from}} the {{inability}} to have a camber and attack angle always adapted to variations trajectories. The angles given to rail fins are a compromise generating straight drag and oppositions in maneuvers. The center fin merit {{of being able to}} adjust its suction face and its angle with the direction of the turn to avoid the <b>hydrodynamic</b> stall. The <b>fin</b> camber and attack angle needed to accord to the different phases of trajectory. When turning left or right the fins need to adjust the camber and attack angles to avoid hydrodynamic stall, so the Adaptive Dynamic Attack & Camber system (ADAC) brought a solution to this hydrodynamic problem. This surf fin technology introduced adaptable structures with variable geometry inspired by aeronautics and biomimetic in the surf.|$|R
2500|$|Most suits have {{relatively}} baggy trouser legs to allow {{passage of the}} feet to the boots. This can hold a large volume of air when inverted, which may pull the boots off the feet. Elastic or tailored [...] "gaiters" [...] can be pulled snug around the lower legs to reduce the potential airspace to help prevent an inversion event and help maintain horizontal trim. Gaiters may also reduce <b>hydrodynamic</b> drag when <b>finning,</b> {{reduce the risk of}} the feet pulling out of the boots when inverted, and can be used effectively on membrane and neoprene suits. Ankle straps perform a similar function. Small ankle-weights (typically one or two pounds) can also be used with any dry suit, both to provide trim weight {{at the bottom of the}} suit, and function as short gaiters to constrict the ankle region of suit once the foot is in the boot. Ankle-weights have to be accelerated and decelerated along with the fins during every kick, which requires more energy from the diver. Gaiters do not have this drawback as they are typically very light and approximately neutral buoyancy.|$|R
40|$|The flagella of {{sturgeon}} sperm have an ultrastructure comprising paddle-like fins extending along most {{of their}} length. These fins are seen in several other marine and freshwater fish. The sperm of these fish are fast swimmers and are relatively short lived: it is therefore tempting to think of these fins as having evolved for hydrodynamic advantage, but the actual advantage they impart, at such a small length scale and slow speed, is unclear. The phrase “the <b>fins</b> improve <b>hydrodynamic</b> efficiency” is commonly found in biological literature, yet little hydrodynamic analysis has previously been used to support such conjectures. In this paper, we examine various hydrodynamic models of sturgeon sperm and investigate both swimming velocity and energy expenditure. All of the models indicate a modest <b>hydrodynamic</b> advantage of <b>finned</b> sperm, in both straight line swimming speed and a hydrodynamic efficiency measure. We find a hydrodynamic advantage for a flagellum with fins, over one without fins, {{of the order of}} 15 – 20 % in straight line propulsive velocity and 10 – 15 % in a hydrodynamic efficiency measure...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of amphibious robots requires actuation that {{enables them to}} crawl as well as swim; sea turtles are excellent examples of amphibious functionality, that can serve as the biomimetic model for the {{development of}} amphibious robots. In this paper we have implemented the observed swimming kinematics of Myrtle, a green sea turtle Chelonia Mydas residing in the Giant Ocean Tank of the New England Aquarium, on the 1. 5 -meter long biomimetic vehicle Finnegan the RoboTurtle. It is shown that these kinematics result in outstanding performance in (a) rapid pitching, and (b) rapid level turning. The turning radius for the rigid hull vehicle is 0. 8 body lengths, a remarkable improvement in turning ability for a rigid hull vehicle. Still Finnegan’s performance lags the live turtle’s performance by about 20 %. Careful observations have shown that turtles employ a fin motion in-line with the direction of locomotion; this degree of freedom was not available to the Finnegan fins, as presently designed. Experimental tests on a flapping fin equipped with this third degree of freedom have shown that the in-line motion enhances the fin’s performance. This hydrodynamic result is doubly beneficial to an amphibious robot, because it allows for further enhancements in the <b>hydrodynamic</b> function of <b>fins,</b> while the in-line motion allows the same fins to be used for crawling on land.

40|$|Lunge-feeding in rorqual whales {{represents}} the largest biomechanical event on Earth {{and one of}} the most extreme feeding methods among aquatic vertebrates. By accelerating to high speeds and by opening their mouth to large gape angles, these whales generate the water pressure required to expand their mouth around a large volume of prey-laden water. Such large influx is facilitated by highly extensible ventral groove blubber (VGB) associated with the walls of the throat (buccal cavity). Based on the mechanical properties of this tissue, previous studies have assumed lunge-feeding to be an entirely passive process, where the flow-induced pressure driving the expansion of the VGB is met with little resistance. Such compliant engulfment would be facilitated by the compliant properties of the VGB that have been measured on dead specimens. However, adjoining the ventral blubber are several layers of well-developed muscle embedded with mechanoreceptors, thereby suggesting a capability to gauge the magnitude of engulfed water and use eccentric muscle action to control the flux of water into the mouth. An unsteady <b>hydrodynamic</b> model of <b>fin</b> whale lunge-feeding is presented here to test whether engulfment is exclusively passive and compliant or involves muscle action. The model is based on the explicit simulation of the engulfed water as it interacts with the buccal cavity walls of the whale, under different heuristically motivated cavity forces. Our results, together with their comparison with velocity data collected in the field, suggest that adult rorquals actively push engulfed water forward from the very onset of mouth opening in order to successfully complete a lunge. Interestingly, such an action involves a reflux of the engulfed mass rather than the oft-assumed rebound, which would occur mainly at the very end of a lunge sequence dominated by compliant engulfment. Given the great mass of the engulfed water, reflux creation adds a significant source of hydrodynamic drag to the lunge process, but with the benefit of helping to circumvent the problem of removing prey from baleen by enhancing the efficiency of cross-flow filtration after mouth closing. Reflux management for a successful lunge will therefore demand well-coordinated muscular actions of the tail, mouth and ventral cavity...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{an entropy}} {{generation}} minimization procedure is employed {{to optimize the}} overall performance (thermal and <b>hydrodynamic)</b> of isolated <b>fin</b> geometries and pin-fin heat sinks. This allows the combined effects of thermal resistance and pressure drop to be assessed simultaneously as the heat sink interacts with the surrounding flow field. New general expressions for the entropy generation rate are developed using mass, energy, and entropy balances over an appropriate control volume. The formulation for the dimensionless entropy generation rate is obtained in terms of fin geometry, longitudinal and transverse pitches, pin-fin aspect ratio, thermal conductivity, arrangement of pin-fins, Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. It is shown that the entropy generation rate depends on two main performance parameters, i. e., thermal resistance and the pressure drop, which in turn depend on the average heat transfer and friction coefficients. These coefficients can be taken from fluid flow and heat transfer models. An extensive literature survey reveals that no comprehensive analytical model for {{any one of them}} exists {{that can be used for}} a wide range of Reynolds number, Prandtl number, longitudinal and transverse pitches, and thermal conductivity. This study is one of the first attempts to develop analytical models for the fluid flow and heat transfer from single pins (circular and elliptical) with and without blockage as well as pin-fin arrays (in-line and staggered). These models can be used for the entire laminar flow range, longitudinal and transverse pitches, any material (from plastic composites to copper), and any fluid having Prandtl numbers (≥ 0. 71). In developing these models, it is assumed that the flow is steady, laminar, and fully developed. Furthermore, the heat sink is fully shrouded and the thermophysical properties are taken to be temperature independent. Using an energy balance over the same control volume, the average heat transfer coefficient for the heat sink is also developed, which is a function of the heat sink material, fluid properties, fin geometry, pin-fin arrangement, and longitudinal and transverse pitches. The hydrodynamic and thermal analyses of both in-line and staggered pin-fin heat sinks are performed using parametric variation of each design variable including pin diameter, pin height, approach velocity, number of pin-fins, and thermal conductivity of the material. The present analytical results for single pins (circular and elliptical) and pin-fin-arrays are in good agreement with the existing experimental/numerical data obtained by other investigators. It is shown that the present models of heat transfer and pressure drop can be applied for a wide range of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers, longitudinal and transverse pitches, aspect ratios, and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, selected numerical simulations for a single circular cylinder and in-line pin-fin heat sink are also carried out to validate the present analytical models. Results of present numerical simulations are also found to be in good agreement...|$|R
