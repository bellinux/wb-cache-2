40|$|The {{notion of}} <b>entangling</b> power of unitaries was {{introduced}} by Zanardi, Zalka and Faoro [PRA, 62, 030301]. We study the <b>entangling</b> power of permutation operators, given {{in terms of a}} combinatorial formula. We show that the permutations with zero <b>entangling</b> power are, up to local unitaries, the identity and the swap. We construct the permutations with the minimum nonzero <b>entangling</b> power for every dimension. With the use of orthogonal latin squares, we construct the permutations with the maximum <b>entangling</b> power for every dimension. Moreover, we show that the value obtained is maximum over all unitaries of the same dimension, with possible exception for 36. We numerically classify, according to their <b>entangling</b> power, the permutation operators of dimension 4 and 9, and we give some estimates for higher dimensions. Finally, we consider the <b>entangling</b> power of unitaries when applied to mixed states...|$|R
40|$|Nonlocal unitary {{operations}} {{can create}} quantum entanglement between distributed particles, and the quantification of created entanglement {{is a hard}} problem. It corresponds to the concepts of <b>entangling</b> and assisted <b>entangling</b> power when the input states are, respectively, product and arbitrary pure states. We analytically derive them for Schmidt-rank-two bipartite unitary and some complex bipartite permutation unitaries. In particular, the <b>entangling</b> power of permutation unitary of Schmidt rank three can take only one of two values: _ 2 9 - 16 / 9 or _ 2 3 ebits. The <b>entangling</b> power, assisted <b>entangling</b> power and disentangling power of 2 Ã— d_B permutation unitaries of Schmidt rank four are all 2 ebits. These quantities are also derived for generalized Clifford operators. We further show that any bipartite permutation unitary of Schmidt rank greater than two has <b>entangling</b> power greater than 1. 223 ebits. We construct the generalized controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates whose assisted <b>entangling</b> power reaches the maximum. We quantitatively compare the <b>entangling</b> power and assisted <b>entangling</b> power for general bipartite unitaries, and study their connection to the disentangling power. We also propose a probabilistic protocol for implementing bipartite unitaries. Comment: 21 pages. Corrected the equality condition in Lemma 1 (i), an inequality sign in Eq.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>entangling</b> capacity of dynamical operations when provided with local ancilla. A comparison is {{made between the}} <b>entangling</b> capacity with and without the assistance of prior entanglement. An analytic solution is found for the log-negativity <b>entangling</b> capacity of two-qubit gates, which equals the entanglement of the Choi matrix isomorphic to the unitary operator. Surprisingly, the availability of prior entanglement does not affect this result; a property we call resource independence of the <b>entangling</b> capacity. We prove several useful upper-bounds on the <b>entangling</b> capacity that hold for general qudit dynamical operations, and for a whole family of entanglement monotones including log-negativity and log-robustness. The log-robustness <b>entangling</b> capacity is shown to be resource independent for general dynamics. We provide numerical results supporting a conjecture that the log-negativity <b>entangling</b> capacity is resource independence for all two-qudit unitaries.

5|$|By-catch is the {{incidental}} {{capture of}} non-target species in fisheries. Fixed and drift gill nets cause the highest mortality levels for both cetaceans and pinnipeds, however, entanglements in long lines, mid-water trawls, and both trap and pot lines are also common. Tuna seines are particularly problematic for entanglement by dolphins. By-catch affects all cetaceans, both small and big, in all habitat types. However, smaller cetaceans and pinnipeds {{are most vulnerable}} as their size means that escape once they are <b>entangled</b> is highly unlikely and they frequently drown. While larger cetaceans are capable of dragging nets with them, the nets sometimes remain tightly attached to the individual and can impede the animal from feeding sometimes leading to starvation. Abandoned or lost nets and lines cause mortality through ingestion or entanglement. Marine mammals also get <b>entangled</b> in aquaculture nets, however, these are rare events and not prevalent enough to impact populations.|$|E

40|$|The {{deterministic}} {{quantum computing}} with one qubit (DQC 1) is a mixed-state quantum computation algorithm that evaluates the normalized {{trace of a}} unitary matrix and is {{more powerful than the}} classical counterpart. We find that the normalized trace of the unitary matrix can be directly described by the <b>entangling</b> power of the quantum circuit of the DQC 1, so the nontrivial DQC 1 is always accompanied with the non-vanishing <b>entangling</b> power. In addition, it is shown that the <b>entangling</b> power also determines the intrinsic complexity of this quantum computation algorithm, i. e., the larger <b>entangling</b> power corresponds to higher complexity.
