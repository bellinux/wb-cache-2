40|$|The flow law {{determined}} experimental ly for solid CO 2 establishes that a hypo-thesis of {{glacial flow}} of C 02 at the Martian poles is not physically unrealistic. Compression experiments carried out under 1 atm pressure and constant strain rate demonstrate hat {{the strength of}} COz near its sublimation point is considerably less than the strength of water ice near its melt <b>ing</b> <b>point.</b> The data fit a power law "creep " equation of the form d = (4 x 106) a ' ° exp (- 12 200 /RT), where ~ is compressive strain rate (sec-t), a is compressive stress (bars), R is the gas constant in calories per mole, and T is absolute temperature. The exponent of a of 3. 9 contrasts with a value near 3. 1 for water ice, and indicates that the strain rate is somewhat more sensitive to stress for CO 2 than for water. Like,rise, the low activation energy for creep, 12 200 calmole- 1, i l lustrates that COz is not highly sensitive to temperature and is thus likely to flow over {{a broad range of}} temper-atures below its melt <b>ing</b> <b>point.</b> Strength values for CO 2 are of the order of one-tenth to one-third the strength of ice under equivalent conditions. A plausible glacial model for the Martian polar caps can be constructed and is helpful in explaining the unique character of the polar regions. CO 2 -rich layers deposited near the pole would have flowed outward laterally to relieve high internal shear stresses. The topography of the polar caps, the uniform layering of the layered deposits, and the general extent of the polar "sediments " could all be explained using this model. Flow of C 02 rather than water ice greatly reduces the problems with Martian glaciation. Nevertheless, problems do remain, in particular the large amounts of CO 2 necessary, the need to increase vapor pressure and temperature with depth in the polar deposits, and the lack of good observa-tional evidence of flow features. Within the limits of the present knowledge of surface conditions on Mars, CO z glaciation appears to be a realistic alternate working hypothesis for the origin of the polar features...|$|E

While space- borne observations do not suer from atmospheric eects, varying star images over a large sensor and aliasing may seriously impede good results. A measure of the achievable precision of ground-based dierential photometry with the prototype photometer for the BRITE satellite mission is reported, using real sky observa- tions. The data were obtained with the photometer attached to a paramount tracking platform, using the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility Software (IRAF) image reduction and analysis methods {{as well as the}} author's own Matlab Code. Special emphasis is placed on the analysis of varying apertures for vary- <b>ing</b> <b>point</b> spread functions, which shows that the accuracy can be improved by taking into account the statistics for each star instead of using a xed aperture. In addition a function is dened, which describes the expected error in terms of instrumental magnitudes, taking into account Poisson distributed noise and mag- nitude independent noise, mainly aliasing. This function is then t to observed data in a two-dimensional least squares sense, providing a calculated aliasing error of 7 millimagnitudes. This function is furthermore rewritten in terms of the stan- dard magnitude B. A maximum magnitude can then be determined for a certain precision, which shows that the Bright Target Explorer (BRITE) can reach a pho- tometric error of 1 millimagnitude for stars with magnitude B < 3 : 5, assuming the worst case duty cycle of 15 minutes.

The SAM 3 N devices have three software-selectable low-power modes: Sleep, Wait and Backup. In Sleep mode, the processor is stopped while all other functions can be kept running. In Wait mode, all clocks and functions are stopped but some peripherals can be configured to wake up the system based on predefined conditions. In Backup mode, only the RTC, RTT, 256 -bit GPBR, and wake-up logic are running. The Real-time Event Managment allows peripherals to receive, react to and send events in Active and Sleep modes without processor intervention. The SAM 3 N series is ready for capacitive touch thanks to the Atmel QTouch® library, offering an easy way to implement buttons, wheels and sliders.

Impurity contents of the shot and wafer may be chosen so that a variety of p-n junction devices results after diffusion, and several junctions may be made on the same wafer by this proc-ess to form more complex structures. Although lifetime and resistivity changes generally occur, they can often be minimized by subsequent treatment such as alloy gettering or annealing.
