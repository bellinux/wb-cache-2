40|$|Introduction］ Liver {{transplant}} recipients suffer more complications than do patients undergoing other <b>gastroenterological</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Many factors inhibit ambulation in {{liver transplant}} patients, {{such as the}} level of restriction to bed rest and length of stay in the intensive care unit（ ICU）. Patients thus face ambulation difficulties. Support for ambulation {{is one of the major}} daily tasks of nurses. We reviewed the ambulation situations of patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation to investigate factors that contributed to ambulation and the nurse’s role therein. ［Patients］ Ten recipients underwent living donor liver transplantation in our hospital between April 2009 and December 2010. Records of the 8 patients who survived were evaluated for this study. ［Result］ According to the postoperative day of initiation of independent walking in the hospital ward, there were no significance difference among operation time, intraoperative bleeding, length of stay in ICU, bed rest level, complications, and rehabilitation intervention. However, the patients who received preoperative guidance were more highly motivated about ambulation than were patients who did not receive preoperative guidance. ［Discussion］ Although initiation of independent walking in the hospital ward differed depending on the patient's general status, it was found that volition is also a strong factor in patient ambulation. Preoperative orientation helps patients to understand perioperative management and clinical course. Moreover, it is necessary to share information with the rehabilitation team and to assist in the activities of daily living for early ambulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONMost <b>gastroenterological</b> <b>surgeries,</b> even {{pancreatic}} surgery, can now {{be performed}} laparoscopically. However, the management of concomitant abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and intra-abdominal malignancy is controversial. The performance of endovascular repair (EVAR) for AAA has been increasing; however, there is no report of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy after EVAR. PRESENTATION OF CASEA pancreatic tumor was detected during follow-up after EVAR for AAA. The enlarging tumor was diagnosed as an intraductal papillary mucinous tumor with a nodule. Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy was safely performed. After laparoscopic dissection around the pancreas head, an additional incision {{was made in the}} upper abdomen, and pancreatic reconstruction was performed through the incision. In spite of grade B pancreatic fistulae, the patient recovered with medical therapy. The pathological diagnosis was intraductal papillary mucinous adenoma with small foci of carcinoma in situ. The patient has been well with neither recurrence of the tumor nor any cardiovascular events for 18 months. DISCUSSIONThe management of concomitant malignancy and AAA is challenging, especially in patients with a pancreatic tumor. The reasons for the rarity of treatment include prognosis, anatomical vicinity, and postoperative complications. EVAR reduces retroperitoneal adhesions. A laparoscopic approach provides a small operative field and decreases mutual interference with AAA. Moreover, reconstruction is performed through an upper abdominal incision apart from the AAA.

40|$|Introducción: Se acepta que la depleción aún moderada de algunos nutrientes puede afectar la evolución del paciente quirúrgico. Objetivo: Evaluar la influencia de los niveles plasmáticos de retinol y de zinc preoperatorios sobre la evolución postoperatoria; evaluar la influencia de la inflamación sobre los niveles de ambos marcadores. Métodos: Se determinaron los niveles plasmáticos de retinol y zinc en 50 pacientes previo a ser sometidos a cirugías gastroenterológicas programadas. Para caracterizar el estado nutricional global de los pacientes se incluyeron el IMC y el porcentaje de pérdida de peso (%PP) previo a la cirugía. Se utilizó la Proteína C Reactiva (PCR) como marcador de inflamación. Durante el seguimiento se registraron las complicaciones postoperatorias. El presente análisis se realizó sobre 43 pacientes con información completa. Resultados: Se hallaron valores bajos de retinol (Introduction: It is {{accepted}} that even mild nutrient depletion {{may affect the}} evolution of the surgical patient. Objective: To evaluate the influence of preoperative levels of plasma retinol and zinc on postoperative evolution of surgical patients; to evaluate the influence of inflammation on both level markers. Methods: Plasma retinol and zinc were determined in 50 patients before programmed <b>gastroenterological</b> <b>surgeries.</b> To detect global malnutrition BMI and weight loss percentage (WL%) were included. C-reactive protein (CRP) was included as inflammation marker. During follow up postoperative complications were recorded. The present analysis was carried out in 43 patients with complete information. Results: Low retinol values (< 20 μg/dl) were founded in 3 cases and low Zn values (< 85 μg/dl) in 20 cases, being 9 of them indicative of severe deficiency (< 70 μg/dl). Postoperative complications were recorded in 17 patients; patients with complications presented lower values of plasma Zn (78. 4 ± 25. 8 vs. 87. 8 ± 25. 7 μg/dl) and retinol (36. 9 ± 14. 5 vs. 49. 7 ± 20. 6; P = 0. 0318) than those with no complications; the number of patients with complications decreased when retinol and Zn ranges increased. No relation between BMI or WL% and appearance of complications was founded; patients with higher WL% were those with higher usual weight. Inflammation affected both markers: retinol dropped from 50. 1 ± 17. 2 to 44. 0 ± 20. 8 and to 23. 7 ± 4. 0 μg/dl for CRP ranges of < 0. 5, 0. 5 - 3. 9 and ≥ 4 mg/dl, respectively (p = 0. 0193); levels of zinc fell from 90. 1 ± 17. 8 to 85. 2 ± 29. 9 and to 55. 0 ± 25. 9 μg/dl for the same CRP ranges (P = 0. 0195). Zn level influenced retinol level, dropping to 33. 1 ± 11. 7 μg/dl of retinol in the Zn severe deficiency group (P = 0. 0386). Conclusions: The obtained results confirm the influence of vitamin A and zinc on postoperative evolution of the surgical patient, while alert about the interrelationships among vitamin A, zinc and inflammation, which lead to difficulty to establish the real source of deficiencies. Beyond these difficulties, retinol and zinc plasma levels determine the nutrient availability for the body and appear as promissory markers of surgical risk...|$|R
40|$|Postsurgical acute {{suppurative}} parotitis is {{a bacterial}} gland infection that occurs from a few days up to some weeks after abdominal surgical procedures. In this study, the authors analyze the prevalence of this complication in Hospital das Clínicas/São Paulo University Medical School by prospectively reviewing the charts of patients who underwent surgeries performed by the <b>gastroenterological</b> and general <b>surgery</b> staff from 1980 to 2005. Diagnosis of parotitis or sialoadenitis was analyzed. Sialolithiasis and chronic parotitis previous to hospitalization were exclusion criteria. In a total of 100, 679 surgeries, 256 patients were diagnosed with parotitis or sialoadenitis. Nevertheless, only three cases of acute postsurgical suppurative parotitis associated with the surgery were identified giving an incidence of 0. 0028 %. All patients presented with risk factors such as malnutrition, immunosuppression, prolonged immobilization and dehydration. In the past, acute postsurgical suppurative parotitis was a relatively common complication after major abdominal surgeries. Its incidence decreased {{as a consequence of}} the improvement of perioperative antibiotic therapy and postoperative support. In spite of the current low incidence, we believe it is important to identify risks and diagnose as quick as possible, in order to introduce prompt and appropriate therapeutic measures and avoid potentially fatal complications with the evolution of the disease...|$|R
40|$|Background: Little {{information}} on the factors influencing intraoperative cardiac arrest and its outcomes in trauma patients is available. This survey evaluated the associated factors and outcomes of intraoperative cardiac arrest in trauma patients in a Brazilian teaching hospital between 1996 and 2009. Methods: Cardiac arrest during anesthesia in trauma patients was identified from an anesthesia database. The data collected included patient demographics, ASA physical status classification, anesthesia provider information, type of surgery, surgical areas and outcome. All intraoperative cardiac arrests and deaths in trauma patients were reviewed and grouped by associated factors and also analyzed as totally anesthesia-related, partially anesthesia-related, totally surgery-related or totally trauma patient condition-related. Findings: Fifty–one cardiac arrests and 42 deaths occurred during anesthesia in trauma patients. They were associated with male patients (P, 0. 001) and young adults (18 – 35 years) (P = 0. 04) with ASA physical status IV or V (P, 0. 001) undergoing <b>gastroenterological</b> or multiclinical <b>surgeries</b> (P, 0. 001).

40|$|Aim: The goal of {{the paper}} was to {{evaluate}} the procedure of percutaneous drainage of symptomatic hepatic cysts under the transabdominal ultrasound control combined with obliteration. Material and method: Within the period from 2005 to 2015, 70 patients diagnosed with a simple hepatic cyst of symptomatic nature were subject to hospitalization and treated at the 2 nd General, <b>Gastroenterological</b> and Cancer <b>Surgery</b> of the Alimentary System Center and Clinics of the Medical University of Lublin. All the patients subject to evaluation were qualified to percutaneous drainage under an ultrasound control. The drainage utilized typical sets of drains with the diameter of at least 9 F, most often of pigtail type. The fluid aspirated form the cyst was dispatched for complex laboratory testing. Further, a 10 % sodium chloride solution was administered to the cyst through the drain, in the volume depending on the previous size of the cyst and the patient’s reaction. Results: Patients reported for a re-visit within the period from 3 to 9 months following the procedure. Complete obliteration of the cyst was confirmed only in 8 patients (11 %). Cyst recurrence was reported in cases when during the ultrasound evaluation, {{the diameter of the}} cyst following aspiration and obliteration enlarged to over 75 % of the initial dimension. In this group, in 10 out of 12 examined (83 %) there was a relapse of the previously observed ailments. Among patients, who has a cyst imaged within the period of observation, which had the diameter from 50 % to 75 % of the previous size, only in 6 cases (37. 5 %) the initial symptoms relapsed. Conclusions: The utilization of a drainage and obliteration enables one to achieve the acceptable result of the therapy as well as significant {{decrease in the number of}} previously reported ailments and symptoms described...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: During {{the past}} three decades {{laparoscopy}} has significantly improved. As fundoplication extensively benefits by the great advantages of the minimally invasive approach, many surgeons chose laparoscopic fundoplication for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in adults and children as well. Pneumothorax, cardiovascular collapse, hypoxia, and hypercarbia are some of the anesthesiologist's principal fears during carbon dioxide insufflation. Thus, monitoring cardiovascular and respiratory status is mandatory to early detect any complication and to maintain a proper balance during pneumoperitoneum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At Gaslini Children's Hospital we performed a prospective nonrandomized study aimed at describing the main cardiorespiratory changes produced by pneumoperitoneum in 33 pediatric patients operated on by laparoscopic fundoplication between January 2000 and June 2001. Patients were divided into two groups; namely, group A and group B. Group A included 14 patients with chronic respiratory symptoms, and group B included 19 children who preoperatively mainly emphasized gastrointestinal symptoms. We monitored intraoperative cardiorespiratory status, timed length of surgery, and described intraoperative complications. RESULTS: No significant cardiovascular changes occurred during carbon dioxide insufflation. Partial oxygen saturation remained still in all the patients. End tidal CO 2, meanly higher in group A children, increased in all the patients after pneumoperitoneum creation, but never exceeded 45 mmHg. Similarly, peak inspiratory pressure increased in all the patients, but was always maintained within acceptable values. Finally, group B patients required a harder and slower surgery, whose length seems to be negatively influenced by age. No intraoperative complication occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Carbon dioxide insufflation does not impair cardiovascular function, if intraabdominal pressure is maintained lower than 10 mmHg nor does it interfere with gas exchanges. Pneumoperitoneum slightly reduces ventilatory function, mainly in respiratory patients with various degrees of underlying bronchopulmonary impairments, but this effect is easily correctable. Thus, laparoscopic fundoplication is feasible and safe in both respiratory and <b>gastroenterological</b> patients, although <b>surgery</b> is easier and faster if periesophagitis is less evident...|$|R

There {{were significantly more}} males in the MRSA VO group than in the MSSA VO group (87.5 % vs. 35.7 %, P = 0.007). Height was significantly higher in MRSA VO; however, {{there were no significant}} differences in weight and BMI between the groups. The mean number of co-morbidities for each patient in the MRSA VO group was significantly larger than that in the MSSA VO group (2.2 ± 1.1 vs. 1.2 ± 0.8, P = 0.011). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of each of the co-morbidities between the MSSA and MRSA patients. History of preceding invasive surgical procedures (postsurgical status) within 3 months except for spinal surgery in the corresponding region was confirmed significantly more often in the MRSA VO group than the MSSA VO group (56.3 % vs. 14.3 %, P = 0.026). Seven patients with MRSA VO and 2 patients with MSSA VO had undergone mainly <b>gastroenterological</b> and cardiovascular <b>surgeries,</b> whereas the remaining 3 patients with MRSA VO had undergone orthopedic surgery for mainly community-acquired infectious arthritis at a previous hospital. Among the MRSA VO patients, 89 % with post-surgical states were diagnosed as having pyogenic spondylodiscitis within 1 month from the past operation.No statistically significant differences between the MSSA VO and MRSA VO groups were observed with regard to pain, fever, neurological deficit, and the onset of symptoms. In the radiographic images, the number, localization, and staging of the vertebral body infections as well as the presence of abscess were similar between the MRSA and MSSA groups.

40|$|Background: A small {{minority}} of patients undergoing <b>gastroenterological</b> <b>surgery</b> {{are at high risk}} for postoperative complications, which may lead to prolonged hospital stay, disproportionate use of resources and increased mortality. The nature and frequency of, and predictive factors for, postoperative complications were studied and the impact of complications on resource utilization was assessed. Methods: A prospective observational study was undertaken of 503 patients undergoing <b>gastroenterological</b> <b>surgery</b> in a tertiary care centre. The incidence of cardiorespiratory, infective and surgical complications was assessed. The need for reoperation, intensive care and length of hospital stay, readmission, death at 6 months and costs were evaluated. Results: Some 235 patients (47 per cent) had at least one complication, most commonly delayed oral intake (n = 70). Complications were associated with cardiovascular disease, prolonged operation, high Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and morbidity, and increased number of Shoemaker's criteria. The length of hospital stay of patients with complications was longer than that of those without complications (11 versus 6 days). Morbidity resulted in a twofold increase in median costs.

30|$|From 1997 to 2007, four {{patients}} were evaluated who were diagnosed histologically with hepatic AML in the Department of <b>Gastroenterological</b> <b>Surgery,</b> Kumamoto University Hospital. All clinicopathological {{data were collected}} in a prospective database. Radiologic data were independently assessed by two radiologists. All patients underwent ultrasonography (US), enhanced computed tomography (CT), CT angiography, and gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced or superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-enhanced MR imaging. To obtain a more correct preoperative diagnosis, we additionally performed DW-MRI with respiratory triggering using b values of 0 and 800  s/mm 2. An ADC map was generated from b values of 0 and 800  s/mm 2 for calculation of ADC.|$|E
40|$|Plasma diamine oxidase (DAO) {{activity}} after heparin injection, a circulatory {{marker for}} the intestinal mucosal integrity, was evaluated shortly after major abdominal surgery. DAO activity {{was measured by}} high-performance liquid chromatography method after 50 units/kg of heparin injection after esophagectomy in 8 patients, total gastrectomy in 16 patients, and pancreatectomy in 7 patients. Blood samples were collected before and at 2, 10, and 30 days after operation. Postheparin DAO activity at the 2 nd day after operation decreased to 60 % of the value before operation (p< 0. 05), then recovered gradually until the 30 th day. The activity decreased in cases after esophagectomy and pancreatectomy (p< 0. 01). It is suggested that the intestinal mucosal integrity decreases in the early course after the major <b>gastroenterological</b> <b>surgery...</b>|$|E
40|$|Pancreatic carcinosarcoma {{is a rare}} {{pancreatic}} neoplasmic variant with {{a dismal}} prognosis. We report {{the case of a}} large tumor of the pancreatic body in abdominal ultrasonography (US). A 58 -year-old man was found in abdominal contrast computed tomography (CT) to have a 5 cm low density mass at the pancreatic body. Based on a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, we conducted distal-pancreatectomy from which the pathological specimen showed pancreatic carcinosarcoma involving invasive ductal adenocar-cinoma and a sarcomatous area of short spindle cells. Sarcomatous cells stained immunohistochemically positive for a mesenchymal marker, yielding a diagnosis of pancreatic carcinosarcoma. Gemcitabine was administered in adjuvant chemotherapy. We found multidisciplinary treatment including surgery and chemotherapy effective in this case. © 2011 The Japanese Society of <b>Gastroenterological</b> <b>Surgery.</b> 症例は 58 歳の男性で，上腹部の痛みと体重減少にて近医受診し，腹部USにて膵体部に低エコー腫瘤を認め当院に紹介された．腹部CTにて膵体部に 5 cm大の造影効果の乏しい腫瘍と，末梢膵管の著明な拡張を認めたため膵体部癌と診断し，膵体尾部切除を行った．病理組織学的に腫瘍は主膵管および周囲の小範囲に浸潤性膵管癌を認める以外，浸潤部のほとんどに広範な異型の強い紡錘形細胞の増殖と線維化を認めた．各種免疫染色検査においてこれらの紡錘形細胞は間葉系マーカーに陽性を示した．以上より，膵体部に発生した癌肉腫と診断した．術後 6 か月経過したが，再発兆候はなく，補助化学療法としてgemcitabine投与を行っている．膵癌肉腫は極めてまれでまた治癒切除が施行された場合でも再発し，急速に進行し予後不良とされている．今後は化学療法を含めた集学的治療の確立のため，さらなる症例数の蓄積が必要と考えられた...|$|E
