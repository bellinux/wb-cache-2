40|$|A maximum <b>jet</b> <b>efficiency</b> line R {{similar to}} 25 (R = L-jet/L-bol), found in FRII radio galaxies by Fernandes et al., was {{extended}} to cover {{the full range of}} jet power by Punsly. Recent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jet formation have mainly focused on the enhancement of jet power. In this work, we suggest that the <b>jet</b> <b>efficiency</b> could be very high even for conventional jet power if the radiative efficiency of disks was much smaller. We adopt the model of a thin disk with magnetically driven winds to investigate the observational high-efficiency jets in FRII radio galaxies. It is found that the structure of a thin disk can be significantly altered by the feedback of winds. The temperature of a disk gradually decreases with increasing magnetic field; the disk density, surface density, and pressure also change enormously. The lower temperature and higher surface density in the inner disk result in the rapid decrease of radiative efficiency. Thus, the <b>jet</b> <b>efficiency</b> is greatly improved even if the jet power is conventional. Our results can explain the observations quite well. The theoretical maximum <b>jet</b> <b>efficiency</b> of R similar to 1000 suggested by our calculations is large enough to explain all of the high <b>jet</b> <b>efficiency</b> in observations, even considering the episodic activity of jets...|$|E
40|$|Unbounded {{outflows}} in {{the form}} of highly collimated jets and broad winds appear to be a ubiquitous feature of accreting black hole systems. The most powerful jets are thought to derive a significant fraction, if not the majority, of their power from the rotational energy of the black hole. Whatever the precise mechanism that causes them, these jets must therefore exert a braking torque on the black hole. We calculate the spin-up function for an accreting black hole, accounting for this braking torque. We find that the predicted black hole spin-up function depends only on the black hole spin and dimensionless parameters describing the accretion flow. Using recent relativistic magnetohydrodynamical numerical simulation results to calibrate the efficiency of angular momentum transfer in the flow, we find that an ADAF flow will spin a black hole up (or down) to an equilibrium value of about 96 % of the maximal spin value in the absence of jets. Combining our ADAF system with a simple model for jet power, we demonstrate that an equilibrium is reached at approximately 93 % of the maximal spin value, as found in the numerical simulation studies of the spin-up of accreting black holes, at which point the spin-up of the hole by accreted material is balanced by the braking torque arising from jet production. Our model also yields a relationship between <b>jet</b> <b>efficiency</b> and black hole spin that is in surprisingly good agreement with that seen in the simulation studies, indicating that our simple model is a useful and convenient description of ADAF inflow - jet outflow about a spinning black hole for incorporation in models of the formation and evolution of galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies.

40|$|The {{suppression}} of pileup jets {{has been a}} crucial component of many physics analyses using 2012 LHC proton-proton collisions. In ATLAS, tracking information {{has been used to}} calculate a variable called the jet-vertex-fraction, which is the fraction of the total mo- mentum of tracks in the jet which is associated to the primary vertex. Imposing a minimum on this variable rejects the majority of pileup jets, but leads to hard-scatter jet efficiencies that depend on the number of reconstructed primary vertices in the event ($N_{Vtx}$). In this note, new track-based variables to suppress pileup jets are developed {{in such a way that}} the resulting hard-scatter <b>jet</b> <b>efficiency</b> is stable as a function of $N_{Vtx}$.

Several parameters dominating the interference flowfield are studied after defining the relative increment of normal {{force and the}} jet amplification factor as the evaluation criterion of jet control performance. The computational results show that most features of the interaction flowfield between the transverse jet and the ramp {{are similar to those}} between a jet and a flat plate, except that the flow structures are more complicated and the low-pressure region behind the jet is less extensive. The relative force increment and the jet amplification factor both increase with the distance between the jet and the ramp shortening till quintuple jet diameters. Inconspicuous difference is observed between the jet-before-ramp and jet-on-ramp cases. The variation of the injection angle changes the extent of the separation region, the plateau pressure, and the peak pressure near the jet. In the present computational conditions, 120 ° is indicated relatively optimal among all the injection angles studied.

The merger of such compact binaries is expected to lead to the production of a spinning BH surrounded by an accreting torus. Several mechanisms can extract energy from this system and power the SGRBs. Here we connect observations and numerical simulations of compact binary mergers, and use the current sample of SGRBs with measured energies to constrain the mass of their powering tori. By comparing the masses of the tori with the results of fully general-relativistic simulations, we are able to infer the properties of the binary progenitors which yield SGRBs. By assuming a constant efficiency in converting torus mass into jet energy, epsilon_{jet}= 10 %, we find that most of the tori have masses smaller than 0. 01 M_{sun}, favoring "high-mass" binary NSs mergers, i. e., binaries with total masses >~ 1. 5 the maximum mass of an isolated NS. This has important consequences for the gravitational-wave signals that may be detected in association with SGRBs, since "high-mass" systems do not form a long-lived hypermassive NS after the merger.

40|$|The spin of {{supermassive black}} holes could power jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN), {{although}} direct observational {{evidence for this}} conjecture is sparse. The accretion disk luminosity and jet power, on the other hand, have long been observed to follow a linear correlation. If jet power is coupled to black hole spin, deviations from the jet-disk correlation for a sample of AGN {{can be used to}} probe the dispersion of the spin parameter within this sample. To exploit this idea, we matched double-lobed radio sources from the FIRST survey to spectroscopically confirmed quasars from SDSS. We obtain 763 FR-II quasars with a median redshift of z= 1. 2 A tight correlation between the optical luminosity of the accretion disk and the lobe radio luminosity is observed. We estimate that 5 - 20 % of the bolometric disk luminosity is converted to jet power. Most of the scatter to the optical-radio correlation is due to environment; deviations from jet-disk coupling due to internal factors (e. g., spin) contribute at most 0. 2 dex. Under the assumption that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism operates in AGN, we obtain an upper limit of 0. 1 dex to the dispersion of the product of the spin and the magnetic flux threading the horizon. If black hole spin determines the AGN <b>jet</b> <b>efficiency,</b> then our observations imply that all FR-II quasars have very similar spin. In addition, the quasar spin distribution needs to have a wide gap to explain the radio-quiet population.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of two parts; the first part deals with observations of the molecular gas towards an unlensed, obscured quasar AMS 12, {{and the second part}} investigates radio undetected, optically selected quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) to determine the nature of the radio flux density distributions of these objects. AMS 12 is an unlensed, obscured, z = 2. 767 quasar which we observed with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer to detect carbon monoxide rotational transitions and atomic carbon fine structure lines in the molecular gas. We present new detections of the CO(5 - 4), CO(7 - 6), [CI](³P₁- ³P₀) and [CI](³P₂− ³P₁) molecular and atomic line transitions in this thesis. AMS 12 is the first unlensed, high redshift source to have both atomic carbon ([CI]) transitions detected. The highly excited molecular gas probed by CO(3 - 2), (5 - 4) and (7 - 6), is modelled with large velocity gradient models. The gas kinetic temperature TG, density n(H₂), and the characteristic size r₀, are determined using the dust temperature from the far-infrared spectral energy distribution which had the following best-fitting parameters log₁₀[LFIR/L☉] = 13. 5, dust temperature TD = 88 K and emissivity index β= 0. 6, as a prior for the gas temperature. The best fitting parameters are TG = 89. 6 K, n(H₂) = 10 3. 9 cm⁻³ and r₀ = 0. 8 kpc. The ratio of the [CI] lines gives a [CI] excitation temperature of 43 ± 10 K, indicating the [CI] and the high-excitation CO are not in thermal equilibrium. The [CI] excitation temperature is below that of the dust temperature and the gas kinetic temperature of the high excitation CO, perhaps because [CI] lies at a larger radius where there may also be a large reservoir of CO at a cooler temperature, which may be detectable through the CO(1 - 0). Using the [CI](³P₁− ³P₀) line we can estimate the strength of the CO(1 - 0) line and hence the gas mass. This suggests that a significant fraction (~ 30 %) of the molecular gas is missed from the high-excitation line analysis, giving a gas mass higher than that inferred from the assumption that the high-excitation gas is a good tracer of the low-excitation gas. The stellar mass was estimated from the mid-/near-infrared spectral energy distribution to be M* ~ 3 × 10 ¹¹M☉. The Eddington limited black hole mass is found from the bolometric luminosity to be M• ≳ 1. 5 × 10 ⁹M☉. These give a black hole - bulge mass ratio of M•/M* ≳ 0. 005. This is in agreement with studies on the evolution of the M•/M* relationship at high redshifts, which find a departure from the local value ~ 0. 002. In {{the second half of the}} thesis we investigate the possible existence of a lower envelope in the radio luminosity versus optical luminosity plane. We select a population of QSOs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometric quasar catalogue from Richards et al. The QSOs are within a narrow redshift band 0. 3 < zphot < 0. 5 and cross-matched with the 1. 4 GHz National Radio Astronomy Observatory Very Large Array Sky Survey. The radio images extracted from the positions of the optical QSOs are retained if the flux integrated over the beam size of the radio survey is less than 3 σIrms ≤ 1. 35 mJy. The radio-undectected QSO population is split into eight samples depending on their optical magnitudes and stacked to determine the mean flux in each sample. The stacked mean flux is detected in all but the faintest optical magnitude sample. The radio versus optical luminosity relation from the stacked samples hint at a lower envelope in the radio luminosity which may be interpreted as there being a minimum radio jet power for a given accretion rate. Stacking assumes the underlying distribution of the property being measured is fairly represented by the stacked result. We investigate the underlying distribution of the radio flux density from the QSOs taking the noise of the sample into account. We find the distribution of the QSO flux density is modelled by a power-law with a negative index in all eight optical magnitude samples. This implies the mean stacked result is not a good representation of the distribution of the flux density of the QSOs and that there is no lower envelope. This highlights the danger of interpreting results from stacking without verifying the distribution is characterised by the mean stacked value. We appear to recover the quasar optical luminosity function when we model the distribution of radio loudness parameters suggesting that, since we are essentially holding the radio flux density fixed, the radio loudness is a function of the optical luminosity. This suggest that the radio loudness is not a fundamental property of the QSO but rather the ratio of two independent properties, the radio and optical luminosities. We convert the radio loudness parameter to jet efficiencies and find a minimum <b>jet</b> <b>efficiency</b> of ηmin = 4 × 10 ⁻⁴. We find there is no sign of a minimum <b>jet</b> <b>efficiency</b> as far as our data’s sensitivity limit allows, so we expect η<ηmin.

It was found that the transmitted power fraction is directly proportional to the inverse of the pulse energy.

A sharp edged dark zone with a maximum extension of 10 to 12 mm away from the target surface develops within 5 μs independently of the pressure and is assumed to be a plasma. In order to find out, if this is also the zone where the majority of the incident laser radiation is absorbed, a CO 2 probe laser beam was directed through the expansion cloud parallel to and at various distances from the sample surface. The front of the absorption zone is found to move rapidly away from the target surface with increasing speed. The absorption lasts twice as long as the laser pulse. It is not associated with a pressure rise that would increase the mechanical impulse. The radial motion of the absorption wave turned out to be faster than the shock wave seen in the Schlieren pictures...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} duty cycle (LSt) on pulsed <b>jet</b> propulsive <b>efficiency</b> was studied {{experimentally}} on a self-propelled underwater vehicle, dubbed Robosquid {{due to the}} similarity of its propulsion system with squid. Robosquid was tested for jet slug length-to-diameter ratios (L/D) in the range 2 – 9 and LSt in the range 0. 2 – 0. 6 with a triangular jet velocity program. Digital particle image velocimetry was used for measuring the impulse and energy of jet pulses to calculate the pulsed-jet propulsive efficiency and compare it with an equivalent steady jet system. Robosquid’s Reynolds number (Re) based on average vehicle velocity and vehicle diameter ranged between 1300 and 2700 for the conditions tested. The results showed {{an increase in the}} ratio of pulsed-jet propulsive efficiency to equivalent steady <b>jet</b> propulsive <b>efficiency</b> (ssPP,ηη) as LSt increased and L/D decreased. For most cases ssPP,ηη was found to be less than 1, indicating better performance of steady jets, but for short L/D and high LSt, ssPP,ηη> 1 appears to be achievable. It was also found that the changes in LSt had a larger effect on propulsive efficiency when compared to changes in L/D...|$|R

40|$|Context. The spin of {{supermassive black}} holes could power jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN), {{although}} direct observational {{evidence for this}} conjecture is sparse. The accretion disk luminosity and jet power, on the other hand, have long been observed to follow a linear correlation. Aims. If jet power is coupled to black hole spin, deviations from the jet-disk correlation for a sample of AGN {{can be used to}} probe the dispersion of the spin parameter (a) within this sample. Methods. To obtain a large sample of radio-loud AGN, we matched double-lobed radio sources identified in Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST, 1. 4 GHz) to spectroscopically confirmed quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We obtain 763 FR II quasars with a median redshift of z = 1. 1. Results. A tight correlation between the optical luminosity of the accretion disk and the lobe radio luminosity is observed. We estimate that 5 – 20 % of the bolometric disk luminosity is converted to jet power. Most of the scatter to the optical-radio correlation is due to environment; deviations from jet-disk coupling due to internal factors (e. g., spin) contribute at most 0. 2 dex. Conclusions. Under the assumption that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism operates in AGN, we obtain an upper limit of 0. 1 dex to the dispersion of the product of the spin and the magnetic flux threading the horizon. If black hole spin determines the AGN <b>jet</b> <b>efficiency,</b> then our observations imply that all FR II quasars have very similar spin. In addition, the quasar spin distribution needs to have a wide gap to explain the radio-quiet population. The alternative, and perhaps more likely, interpretation of the tight jet-disk correlation is that black hole spin is not relevant for powering AGN jets. 1...|$|E
40|$|We use recent {{progress}} in simulating {{the production of}} magnetohydrodynamic jets around black holes to derive the cosmic spin history of the most massive black holes, with masses >~ 10 ^ 8 Msol. Assuming the <b>jet</b> <b>efficiency</b> depends on spin a, we can approximately reproduce the observed `radio loudness' of quasars and the local radio luminosity function. Using the X-ray luminosity function and the local mass function of supermassive black holes, SMBHs we can reproduce the individual radio luminosity functions of radio sources showing high- and low-excitation narrow emission lines. The data favour spin distributions that are bimodal, with one component around spin zero and the other close to maximal spin. In the low-excitation galaxies, the two components have similar amplitudes. For the high-excitation galaxies, the amplitude of the high-spin peak is typically much smaller {{than that of the}} low-spin peak. A bimodality should be seen in the radio loudness of quasars. We predict that the low-excitation galaxies are dominated by SMBHs with masses >~ 10 ^ 8 Msol, down to radio luminosity densities ~ 10 ^ 21 W Hz- 1 sr- 1 at 1. 4 ~GHz. Our model is also able to predict the radio luminosity function at z= 1, and predicts it to be dominated by high-excitation galaxies above luminosity densities >~ 10 ^ 26 W Hz- 1 sr- 1, in full agreement with the observations. From our parametrisation and using the best fitting jet efficiencies there is marginal evidence for evolution in spin: the mean spin increases slightly from ~ 0. 25 at z= 1 to ~ 0. 35 at z= 0, and the fraction of SMBHs with a>= 0. 5 increases from 0. 16 +- 0. 03 at z= 1 to 0. 24 +- 0. 09 at z= 0. Our results are in excellent agreement with the mean radiative efficiency of quasars, as well as recent cosmological simulations.

40|$|Using {{high-resolution}} 3 -D and 2 -D (axisymmetric) hydrodynamic simulations in spherical geometry, {{we study}} {{the evolution of}} cool cluster cores heated by feedback-driven bipolar active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets. Condensation of cold gas, and the consequent enhanced accretion, is required for AGN feedback to balance radiative cooling with reasonable efficiencies, and to match the observed cool core properties. A feedback efficiency (mechanical luminosity ≈ϵṀ_ acc c^ 2; where Ṁ_ acc is the mass accretion rate at 1 kpc) as small as 5 × 10 ^- 5 is sufficient to reduce the cooling/accretion rate by ∼ 10 compared to a pure cooling flow. This value is smaller compared to the ones considered earlier, and {{is consistent with the}} <b>jet</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the fact that {{only a small fraction of}} gas at 1 kpc is accreted on to the supermassive black hole (SMBH). We find hysteresis cycles in all our simulations with cold mode feedback: condensation of cold gas when the ratio of the cooling-time to the free-fall time (t_ cool/t_ ff) is ≲ 10 leads to a sudden enhancement in the accretion rate; a large accretion rate causes strong jets and overheating of the hot ICM such that t_ cool/t_ ff > 10; further condensation of cold gas is suppressed and the accretion rate falls, leading to slow cooling of the core and condensation of cold gas, restarting the cycle. Therefore, there is a spread in core properties, such as the jet power, accretion rate, for the same value of core entropy or t_ cool/t_ ff. A fewer number of cycles are observed for higher efficiencies and for lower mass halos because the core is overheated to a longer cooling time. The 3 -D simulations show the formation of a few-kpc scale, rotationally-supported, massive (∼ 10 ^ 11 M_) cold gas torus.

Most of the improvements in efficiency were gained {{in the first decade}} when jet craft first came into widespread commercial use. Between 1971 and 1998 the fleet-average annual improvement per available seat-kilometre was estimated at 2.4%.

40|$|A data {{sample of}} pp {{collisions}} with an integrated luminosity of 6. 75 nb^− 1 was collected {{using a combination}} of a minimum bias trigger and a single jet trigger at √(s) = 7 TeV using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. It is analysed to study diffractive dijet production, i. e. events with a hadronic system containing at least two jets in addition to a large region of pseudorapidity devoid of hadronic activity. The cross section is presented differentially with respect to Δη^F, the largest continuous region of pseudorapidity which extends {{from the edge of the}} detector at = ± 4. 9 and contains no final state particles above threshold momentum cuts, over the region 0 < Δη^F < 6. 5. It is also presented differentially in the variable ξ^±, which estimates the fractional momentum loss of the proton in single diffractive dissociation (pp → pX) events. Comparing the data distributions with a Monte Carlo model suggest that fluctuations in the hadronisation process allow non-diffractive dijets to look like diffractive events, but that the data cannot be described solely by non-diffractive dijet production. In addition, the monitoring of the electromagnetic and <b>jet</b> <b>efficiencies</b> for the ATLAS Level- 1 Calorimeter Trigger is described...|$|R
40|$|The <b>jet</b> {{production}} <b>efficiency</b> {{of radio}} galaxies {{can be quantified}} by comparison of their kinetic jet powers P_jet and Bondi accretion powers P_B. These two parameters {{are known to be}} related linearly, with the jet power resulting from the Bondi power by multiplication with an efficiency factor of order 1 %. Using a recently published (Nemmen + Tchekhovskoy 2014) high-quality sample of 27 radio galaxies, I construct a P_B-P_jet diagram that includes information on optical AGN types as far as available. This diagram indicates that the <b>jet</b> production <b>efficiency</b> is a function of AGN type: Seyfert 2 galaxies seem to be systematically (with a false alarm probability of 0. 043 %) less efficient, by about one order of magnitude, in powering jets than Seyfert 1 galaxies, LINERs, or the remaining radio galaxies. This suggests an evolutionary sequence from Sy 2 s to Sy 1 s and LINERs, controlled by an interplay of jets {{on the one hand and}} dust and gas in galactic nuclei on the other hand. When taking this effect into account, the P_B-P_jet relation is probably much tighter intrinsically than currently assumed. Comment: 3 pages, 1 figure, 1 table.
