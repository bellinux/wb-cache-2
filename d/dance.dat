5|$|Tripura {{is noted}} for bamboo and cane handicrafts. Bamboo, wood and cane {{are used to}} create an array of furniture, utensils, {{hand-held}} fans, replicas, mats, baskets, idols and interior decoration materials.

Each indigenous community has its own repertoire of songs and dances performed during weddings, religious occasions, and other festivities. The Tripuri and Jamatia people perform goria <b>dance</b> during the Goria puja. Jhum <b>dance</b> (also called tangbiti <b>dance),</b> lebang <b>dance,</b> mamita <b>dance,</b> and mosak sulmani <b>dance</b> are other Tripuri <b>dance</b> forms.

5|$|Although boogaloo {{was already}} a fad <b>dance</b> and a music genre in the 1960s, it did not become a <b>dance</b> style until Boogaloo Sam learned it, {{expanded}} it, and started performing it in public venues. He was influenced to expand boogaloo by cartoons; the 1960s social dances the Twist, the Popcorn, and the Jerk; and the movements of everyday people. As a <b>dance</b> style, it is characterized by rolling hip, knee, and head movements as if the body has no bones. Electric boogaloo is the signature <b>dance</b> style of The Electric Boogaloos. It {{is a combination of}} boogaloo and popping.|$|E

5|$|Another style the <b>dance</b> {{industry}} {{created in}} response to hip-hop was jazz-funk. This style was shown in its early form on a sketch comedy series called In Living Color. The resident <b>dance</b> troupe, The Fly Girls, opened and closed every show with a hip-hop and jazz performance choreographed by Rosie Perez. Jazz-funk (also called street-jazz) is a hybrid of hip-hop and jazz <b>dance.</b> R singer Beyoncé uses this style. Korean <b>dance</b> crew Prepix also uses this style. They have choreographed for K-pop singers Jay Park and G.NA {{as well as for}} K-pop boy bands 2PM and B2ST. Although jazz-funk borrows from hip-hop <b>dance,</b> it is not considered a style of hip-hop because the foundational movements are jazz. In hip-hop—even in lyrical hip-hop—there are no pirouettes or arabesques and dancers do not perform on relevé (on the balls of the feet). However, these methods are used in jazz-funk and in jazz <b>dance</b> in general.|$|E
