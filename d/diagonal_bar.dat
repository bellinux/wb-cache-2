30|$|The HPFRCC {{specimen}} HC- 3.5, {{which was}} reinforced with bundled diagonal reinforcement and one-half {{the amount of}} code-specified transverse steel, showed early flexural cracks at 0.25 % drift. By about 2 % drift, numerous diagonal tension cracks spread over the entire span (Fig.  9 d), and most <b>diagonal</b> <b>bars</b> underwent yielding. However, the cracks were less than 0.5  mm wide at 2 % drift, only one-fourth the width of cracks in RC- 3.5 at the same drift. As in the specimens of aspect ratio 2.0, the cracks in HC- 3.5 were much narrower and fewer than those in RC- 3.5, as shown in Figs.  9 d–f. No buckling in <b>diagonal</b> <b>bars</b> was observed in HC- 3.5. Also, HC- 3.5 did not suffer any spalling damage, until it started to collapse with the rupture of some <b>diagonal</b> <b>bars</b> at 10 % drift (Fig.  9 f).|$|R
30|$|Reinforcement details must affect {{structural}} safety {{under the}} complicated stresses. Longitudinal reinforcements should be continuous through connectors without splices and joints of the reinforcing rebar {{within the distance}} of twice the beam depth from the connection faces, which is the required sufficient development length in connections (Bounds 2010; Dusenberry 2010). Diagonal reinforcements {{can be used to}} enhance the behavior of connections. According to Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3 - 340 - 02, development length of <b>diagonal</b> <b>bars</b> for the blast-resistant joints should be more than 20 times of bar diameter over the critical section, which is generally taken at a distance ‘d (effective depth)’ {{from the face of the}} connections(DoD 2008; Bounds 2010). The beneficial effects of the <b>diagonal</b> <b>bars</b> on the blast-resistance of connections were studied by a few researchers, but the structural behavior of blast-resistant connections reinforced with <b>diagonal</b> <b>bars</b> has not been fully investigated (Krauthammer 1996, 1997, 1999).|$|R
30|$|Specimen BC-D {{reinforced}} with additional diagonal reinforcements showed that deflections at Points A and B were effectively controlled when comparing to Specimen BC, {{as shown in}} Table  6. It shows that <b>diagonal</b> <b>bars</b> are essential in concrete joints subjected to blast loads, {{which is consistent with}} previous studies (ACI 2011; DoD 2008). Also, deflection of Specimen BC-D at Point A was about 3 times less than that of Specimen BC-F {{reinforced with}} additional flexural bars whose steel ratio is same as <b>diagonal</b> <b>bars</b> of Specimen BC-D. Therefore, it can be another finding that diagonal reinforcements would be more effective to resist blast loads than additional flexure reinforcements.|$|R

30|$|In {{specimen}} RC- 2.0, {{made with}} normal concrete, bundled diagonal reinforcement and code-specified transverse reinforcement, inclined cracks {{began to develop}} at approximately 0.25 % drift. By 2 % drift, the width of inclined cracks increased to about 1.5  mm (Fig.  8 a), and most <b>diagonal</b> <b>bars</b> underwent yielding near the beam-stub interfaces. At 5 % drift, the inclined cracks widened to greater than 4.5  mm, and some spalling of concrete under compression occurred at the beam ends (Fig.  8 b). Slight buckling in the <b>diagonal</b> bundled <b>bars</b> was observed. Eventually, at about 7 % drift, RC- 2.0 started to collapse owing to the rupture of some <b>diagonal</b> <b>bars</b> (Fig.  8 c). It is noted that the crack patterns were somewhat asymmetric (Fig.  8) even though {{the rotation of the}} top stub (reaction block) was restrained by the supports of the guide columns. This may be resulted from an imperfect installation of the test setup.|$|R
40|$|Ductile coupled {{walls are}} {{important}} elements in resisting seismic loads in tall buildings. Ductile coupling beams must possess excellent energy absorption characteristics and significant ductility. Coupling beams with small span-to-depth ratios typically utilize <b>diagonal</b> <b>bars</b> {{to resist the}} shear and flexure. The present method for the confinement of the diagonal reinforcement requires closely spaced seismic hoops. This type of coupling beam is difficult to assemble and has several areas of congested steel bars. To simplify construction and ease the steel congestion, it is proposed that the confinement of the <b>diagonal</b> <b>bars</b> be provided by headed bars. Two full-scale coupling beam specimens, one with confining hoops and one with headed bar confinement, were tested under reversed cyclic loading at McGill University. Both specimens contained identical <b>diagonal</b> <b>bars</b> and distributed reinforcement and were constructed from the same batch of concrete. The responses of the specimens were compared {{with respect to the}} general hysteretic responses, including ductility, energy absorption and load sustainability. The specimen using headed bar confinement performed as well as, or better than the specimen with seismic hoops. The ease of construction and excellent performance of the specimen containing headed bars make this type of confinement a viable alternative for ductile coupling beams...|$|R

No buckling in the <b>diagonal</b> <b>bars</b> occurred in this specimen.

30|$|Coupled shear {{walls are}} {{efficient}} in resisting lateral forces induced by winds and earthquakes. However, {{it is difficult}} to construct coupled shear walls particularly because current design codes require complex reinforcing details within coupling beams. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop simple reinforcement details for diagonally reinforced coupling beams; reducing transverse steel by use of high-performance fiber-reinforced cementitious composites (HPFRCCs) and bundling <b>diagonal</b> <b>bars</b> are explored. Four coupling beam specimens with length-to-depth aspect ratios of 2.0 or 3.5 were fabricated and tested under cyclic lateral displacements. The test results revealed that HPFRCC coupling beams with bundled <b>diagonal</b> <b>bars</b> and widely spaced transverse reinforcement (one-half the amount of reinforcement required by current seismic codes) exhibited excellent seismic performance compared with ordinary concrete coupling beams having code-required distributed diagonal reinforcement and transverse reinforcement.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the effects of}} hooked-end steel fibre contents on the mechanical properties of high-performance concrete (HPC) and investigates the feasibility of utilizing steel fibres to simplify the complicated reinforcement detailing of critical HPC members under high shear stress. Mechanical properties of HPCs with specified compressive strength of 60 and 100 [*]MPa include the flow, air content, compressive strength, and flexural strength. The effectiveness of 1. 50 % steel fibre content on the shear behaviour of diagonally reinforced concrete coupling beam without additional transverse reinforcement was investigated to alleviate complex reinforcing details for the full section confinement of <b>diagonal</b> <b>bar</b> groups. The test results revealed the incorporation of steel fibres significantly affected the mechanical properties of the HPCs. For diagonally reinforced coupling beam (SFRCCB) without additional transverse reinforcement, the addition of 1. 5 % steel fibre content into 60 [*]MPa HPC coupling beam provides similar cracking and structural behaviours compared to those of diagonally reinforced coupling beam (CCB) with full section confinement details.

The inclination angles of bundled diagonal reinforcement in the specimens with the aspect ratios of 2.0 and 3.5 were about 22.1 ° and 10.7 °, respectively. ACI 318 - 14 (ACI 2014) specifies that horizontal reinforcement in diagonally reinforced coupling beams (Fig.  1), mainly used to provide anchorage for horizontal crossties, shall not develop the yield strength at walls. In this study, the embedment length of horizontal reinforcement into {{the top and bottom}} stubs was 50  mm in all specimens. For producing the sufficient anchorage of bundled diagonal bars, they were sufficiently extended to the top and bottom concrete stubs. The coupling beams with large extending bars may not be effective for construction.
