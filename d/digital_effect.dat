5|$|The Expendables 2 {{contains}} approximately 1,547 <b>digital</b> <b>effect</b> shots. The {{main effects}} studio was Worldwide FX (WWFX), which produced 1,186 of the shots, and a further 800 shots which were discarded {{in response to}} changes to the film's story. Several other studios, including El Ranchito, Malditochrome, Tata Elxsi, Reliance Mediaworks, and , also produced effects shots for the film through WWFX. <b>Digital</b> <b>effect</b> pre-production began in July 2011 and was completed one year later. WWFX's primary facility is situated in Sofia, allowing them to have constant access to the production, and model assets of the sets before their practical versions were built; this enabled WWFX to raise issues relating to the designs early and develop an optimised construction plan. Anything that was considered to potentially need a computer generated double was photographed and digitally modeled {{even if it was}} not scheduled to appear in the film, which later served useful as the film's story was adjusted, requiring WWFX to rebuild entire scenes.|$|E

5000|$|Rosebush {{began working}} in {{computer}} animation in 1970, founding the company <b>Digital</b> <b>Effects</b> Inc. in New York City in 1978. As the first 3D digital computer animation company in New York, <b>Digital</b> <b>Effects</b> had to pioneer its own software. In 1986, {{two years after}} <b>Digital</b> <b>Effects</b> ceased operations, Rosebush founded the Judson Rosebush Company. Formerly located in Carnegie Hall, the company produces consumer CD-ROMs, business-to-business CD-ROMs and websites.|$|R

500|$|... "Apocrypha" [...] was {{the first}} mythology-centered episode to be {{directed}} by Manners, and made use of a mixture of physical and <b>digital</b> <b>effects</b> to create the episode's antagonistic black oil. The episode's sets were also augmented with <b>digital</b> <b>effects,</b> amplifying what could be constructed within the given budget.|$|R
500|$|While {{writing the}} script, Carruth studied physics {{to help him}} make Abe and Aaron's {{technical}} dialogue sound authentic. He took {{the unusual step of}} eschewing contrived exposition, and tried instead to portray the shorthand phrases and jargon used by working scientists. This philosophy carried over into production design. The time machine itself is a plain gray box, with a distinctive electronic [...] "hum" [...] created by overlaying the sounds of a mechanical grinder and a car engine, rather than by using a processed <b>digital</b> <b>effect.</b> Carruth also set the story in unglamorous industrial parks and suburban tract homes.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} several special effects. The stab {{wounds that}} were on Fellig's back were constructed in [...] "precisely graduated sizes" [...] to show Fellig's healing powers. The faux-wounds were then applied to Lewis' back by make-up department head Cheri Montesanto-Mecalf. The hardest <b>digital</b> <b>effect</b> to create was the transformation of select figures from color into black-and-white. Visual effects producer Bill Millar noted that the process, was [...] "very {{similar to the one}} used to wreck all those old movies by colorizing them. In fact, it's basically the same, only in reverse". The [...] "painstaking" [...] process involved outlining the portion of the frame to be de-colorized. A computer program was then used to complete the job. Millar, who had previously used the technique on the NBC series Nightmare Cafe in 1992, had used it in the 1998 movie Pleasantville.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} escape his father, Clark decides {{to use a}} kryptonite key to destroy his spaceship. When Clark puts the kryptonite key into the spaceship, Beck and his FX team tried to create a [...] "virus/fungus" [...] growth from the key slot to {{simulate}} [...] "some sort of fractal decay". Mike McCormick worked specifically {{on the process of}} destroying the ship, giving the ship the appearance that it has a [...] "nasty skin infection" [...] that is spreading as if it is caught in the circulatory system. Next, Beck had to tackle the problem of the ship's final destruction. Originally, it was intended to have the ship explode, but no one wanted to have to rebuild the Kent farm. Instead, they settled on a giant EMP wave given off by the ship the moment it is destroyed. Entity FX created a beam of light that shot vertically up from the ship's location and then fell back down expanding into a [...] "ripple that spread across the land". This beam of light would create a crater where the storm cellar was, which was dug prior to filming and digitally covered up so as to keep the illusion. One of the final shots of the episode was of Lex watching as his plane crashed into the ocean. In a homage to Robert Zemeckis's Cast Away, Entity FX crafted a <b>digital</b> <b>effect</b> of the ocean water flooding Lex's plane as it hits the ocean. The scene is reminiscent of the same scene in Cast Away where Tom Hanks's character also watches as the ocean water floods his plane as he crash lands in the ocean.|$|E
