5|$|The {{following}} examples do {{not represent}} an <b>exhaustive</b> list of Swedish municipal arms. See the list of municipalities of Sweden for a complete listing of these.|$|E
5|$|This list is not <b>exhaustive</b> {{but does}} {{represent}} {{some of the}} central feminist economic critiques of traditional economics, out of {{the wide variety of}} such viewpoints and critiques.|$|E
5|$|As part of Apollo 11's 40th {{anniversary in}} 2009, NASA spearheaded {{an effort to}} {{digitally}} restore the existing videotapes of the mission's live televised moonwalk. After an <b>exhaustive</b> three-year search for missing tapes of the original video of the Apollo 11 moonwalk, NASA concluded the data tapes had more than likely been accidentally erased.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Hasso von Winning {{published}} an <b>exhaustive</b> classification of Western Mexico shaft tomb artifacts (including, for example, the Chinesco A through D types mentioned above), a classification still largely in use today.|$|E
5|$|Many Chaplin-unauthorized {{compilations}} of his Keystone, Essanay and Mutual {{films were}} {{released in the}} years following his departure from those companies. This is not an <b>exhaustive</b> list but does contain the most notable and widely released examples. Eventually Chaplin re-edited and scored his First National shorts for reissue in 1959 and 1975.|$|E
5|$|Note: It is very {{difficult}} to find a complete and <b>exhaustive</b> list {{of the members of the}} scientific expedition. Often, it is necessary to make conjectures based on incomplete information. Names marked are those found in various sources, but still in doubt.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} Smoking Popes {{songs were}} released on compilation albums. This {{is not an}} <b>exhaustive</b> list; songs that were first released on the band's albums, EPs, or singles are not included.|$|E
5|$|The most <b>exhaustive</b> {{biography}} of Priestley is Robert Schofield's recent two-volume work; several one-volume treatments exist, all somewhat older: Gibbs, Holt and Thorpe. Graham and Smith focus on Priestley's life in America and Uglow and Jackson both discuss Priestley's {{life in the}} context of other developments in science.|$|E
5|$|The report {{indicates}} not all or {{a majority}} of these factors need to exist for an electoral device to result in discrimination, and it also indicates that this list is not <b>exhaustive,</b> allowing courts to consider additional evidence at their discretion.|$|E
5|$|While Leonardo's {{experimentation}} followed clear scientific methods, {{a recent}} and <b>exhaustive</b> analysis of Leonardo {{as a scientist}} by Fritjof Capra argues that Leonardo was a fundamentally different kind of scientist from Galileo, Newton and other scientists who followed him in that, as a Renaissance Man, his theorising and hypothesising integrated the arts and particularly painting.|$|E
5|$|A 1993 study {{commissioned}} by the United States Army investigated racial discrimination in the awarding of medals. At the time, no Medals of Honor had been awarded to black soldiers who served in World War II. After an <b>exhaustive</b> review of files, the study recommended that several black Distinguished Service Cross recipients be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. On January 13, 1997, President Bill Clinton awarded the Medal to seven African American World War II veterans; of these, only Vernon Baker was still alive.|$|E
5|$|Below is {{a summary}} of the titles/positions held, at one time or another, by the 53 {{individuals}} depicted on United States banknotes from 1861 to the present. The list of positions is not <b>exhaustive,</b> but does address the central elected federal and state officials, members of the President’s cabinet, military figureheads, and several of the founders and framers of the United States government.|$|E
5|$|Coandă and his 1910 {{aircraft}} {{were absent}} from much of aviation {{literature of the}} day. None of the annual issues of Jane's All the World's Aircraft ever mentioned the Coandă-1910 or its turbo-propulseur powerplant. The Soviet engineer Nikolai Rynin {{made no mention of}} Coandă in his <b>exhaustive</b> nine-volume encyclopaedia on jet and rocket engines, written in the late 1920s and early '30s.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} not an exact science. Decompression models {{approximate}} a physiological process that is incompletely understood, and rather complex, by simple mathematical models, {{in the hope of}} producing a useful procedure with acceptably low risk of injury to the user. New information allows theories and models to be modified to provide more reliable results, and the availability of faster and more powerful computer processors at low cost has made more <b>exhaustive</b> numerical methods more practicable, and the computation of relatively far more complex models is now quite possible, even in real time.|$|E
5|$|In early 1847, Jean-Baptiste Bourgault, {{owner of}} the Wolfe Street premises, {{notified}} Cadron-Jetté and the Hospice that he was evicting them, citing concern for his reputation. After <b>exhaustive</b> enquiries, a new premises was located {{on the corner of}} Sainte-Catherine and Saint-André streets, provided by John Donegani, a Montreal businessman, at a rent of 60 dollars a year. On April 26, 1847, the Hospice moved to the new site.|$|E
5|$|Kalimpong is also {{famous for}} their rich {{practice}} of cactus cultivation. Its nurseries attract people from far and wide for the absolutely stunning collection of cacti they cultivate. The strains of cacti, though not indigenous to the locale, have been carefully cultivated over the years, and now the town boasts {{one of the most}} fascinating and <b>exhaustive</b> collections of the Cactaceae family. The plants have adapted well to the altitude and environment, and now prove {{to be one of the}} chief draws of tourism to the township.|$|E
5|$|On May 20, 1912, a {{ceremony}} {{was held in}} Richmond for the laying of {{the cornerstone of the}} Confederate Memorial Institute's Battle Abbey. White gave the ceremony's principal address, in which he delivered an <b>exhaustive</b> history of the movement for the construction of the abbey and spoke on the importance of the abbey being built in the former Confederate capital. He also called for the cooperation of the Southern states in providing artifacts to the abbey.|$|E
5|$|Sony Pictures Entertainment began {{development}} on the film in 2009. It took the company {{a few months to}} obtain the rights to the novel, while recruiting Zaillian and David Fincher. The casting process for the lead roles was <b>exhaustive</b> and intense; Craig faced scheduling conflicts, and a number of actresses were sought for the role of Lisbeth Salander. The script took over six months to write, which included three months of analyzing the novel.|$|E
5|$|The biography, Lindbergh, {{was highly}} anticipated; {{prior to its}} publication, the book's film rights were bought, sight unseen, by Steven Spielberg, who planned to direct a movie of it. Published in 1998, Lindbergh sold about 250,000 copies in hardcover, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. Berg was noted for his <b>exhaustive</b> research, {{as well as his}} sympathetic, but by no means uncritical, {{approach}} to Lindbergh, whose alleged anti-Semitism he addressed in a straightforward, unblinking manner.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{noted for its}} heft, {{in terms of its}} actual page numbers, <b>exhaustive</b> research, and dense {{academic}} language. The writing does occasionally include illustrative anecdotes and some plain language. Rifkin synthesizes research and material from fields such as literature and the arts, theology, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, political science, psychology, and communication theory. The book was described as sociobiology. The Empathic Civilization was contrasted to the book Crisis Economics by Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm, as reaching different conclusions but being complementary by offering valid alternative futures different from contemporary belief in social progress.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} {{surgical}} versus non-surgical treatments for osteochondritis dissecans is controversial. Consequently, {{the type and}} extent of surgery necessary varies based on patient age, severity of the lesion, and personal bias of the treating surgeon—entailing an <b>exhaustive</b> list of suggested treatments. A variety of surgical options exist {{for the treatment of}} persistently symptomatic, intact, partially detached, and completely detached OCD lesions. Post-surgery reparative cartilage is inferior to healthy hyaline cartilage in glycosaminoglycan concentration, histological, and immunohistochemical appearance. As a result, surgery is often avoided if non-operative treatment is viable.|$|E
5|$|The {{first true}} {{national}} census with <b>exhaustive</b> and broad coverage {{was carried out}} in 1872. The small number of people and small number of towns reported by the census reveal Brazil's enormous territory to have been sparsely populated. It showed Brazil as having a total population of 9,930,478 inhabitants. Estimates made by the government in prior decades showed 4,000,000 inhabitants in 1823 and gave a figure of 7,000,700 in 1854. The population was distributed across 20 provinces and the Neutral Municipality (the Empire's capital) with 641 municipalities.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{is not an}} <b>exhaustive</b> list of the 133 historic cities in Sweden, but a brief list of cities that are notable and bear heraldic significance {{within the context of}} Swedish heraldry. Each is listed by the city name, in general chronological order with the approximate year of settlement or city charter. Note that most city arms originated in the Middle Ages as a city seal, and all were registered as municipality (kommun) arms in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The funerary cult of Djedkare Isesi {{enjoyed a}} revival during the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1077 BC). For {{the early part}} of this period, this is best attested by the Karnak king list, a list of kings {{commissioned}} by pharaoh Thutmose III. The list was not meant to be <b>exhaustive,</b> rather it gave the names of Thutmose's forefathers whom he wanted to honor by dedicating offerings.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} work was <b>exhaustive,</b> involving {{the filming of}} numerous churches in Norfolk, both ancient and more modern. Many of the clergymen featured in the programme were discovered by accident or by word-of-mouth. For example, the production researcher managed to find, on request, a vicar who had an extensive model railway in his rectory, another whose ministry was based on water (the Chaplain of the Broads) and a vicar whose congregation at the time numbered zero.|$|E
5|$|As John Wilson {{and others}} have noted, it is {{difficult}} to define leisure. Its definitions are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience irrespective of time. Joffre Dumazedier distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope. The first and broadest defines leisure as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to self-fulfillment. Dumazedier's four definitions are not <b>exhaustive.</b> Incompatible definitions and measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings.|$|E
5|$|Chicago {{earned a}} general score of 7.0 during the Applicant phase, after a {{detailed}} study of the Applicant Files received by the IOC Working Group on January 14, 2008. Between April 4 and 7, 2009, the IOC Evaluation Commission, led by Nawal El Moutawakel, arrived in Chicago to assess {{the conditions of the}} city. The Commission attended technical presentations, participated in question-and-answer sessions about the Candidature File, and made inspections in all the existing venues across the city. Though considered a favorite entering the voting process, and despite personal appeals from such high-profile Chicagoans as U.S. President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and Oprah Winfrey, Chicago was eliminated on the first ballot in IOC voting on October 2, 2009, with 18 votes in a three-round <b>exhaustive</b> ballot of the IOC.|$|E
5|$|Data-driven, Romney often {{played the}} role of a devil's {{advocate}} during <b>exhaustive</b> analysis of whether to go forward with a deal. He wanted to drop a Bain Capital hedge fund that initially lost money, but other partners disagreed with him and it eventually made billions. He opted out of the Artisan Entertainment deal, not wanting to profit from a studio that produced R-rated films. Romney served {{on the board of directors}} of Damon Corporation, a medical testing company later found guilty of defrauding the government; Bain Capital tripled its investment before selling off the company, and the fraud was discovered by the new owners (Romney was never implicated). In some cases, Romney had little involvement with a company once Bain Capital acquired it.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Howard and Outram {{launched}} the Gauntlet Press, a small private press which produced hand-bound letterpress volumes of Outram's poetry and Howard's wood engravings. These limited editions, prized by collectors, {{can also be}} found in such public collections as Library and Archives Canada, the Library of Congress, the British Library and the University of Toronto Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s the Gauntlet Press also issued a series of letterpress broadsheets of Outram's poems, all of them designed (and many illustrated) by Howard. Digital facsimiles of the books and broadsheets of the Gauntlet Press {{in the collection of the}} Memorial University of Newfoundland can be viewed at the website dedicated to The Gauntlet Press of Richard Outram and Barbara Howard, together with extensive background material and an <b>exhaustive</b> bibliography.|$|E
5|$|While Kublai {{attended}} to other {{matters in the}} north, the Song court was mobilizing its populace for war and all available resources that could be rendered and drained into the war effort. In the mid 13th century, the Song government led by Jia Sidao began confiscating portions of estates owned by the rich {{in order to raise}} revenues in a land nationalization scheme. This had the negative effect of alienating the wealthy landowners and hastening the collapse of the empire, as wealthy landlords and merchants favored what they deemed the inevitable Mongol conquest and rule than the other alternative of paying higher taxes for continual, <b>exhaustive</b> warfare.|$|E
25|$|A method {{closer to}} IRV is the <b>exhaustive</b> ballot. In this method—one {{familiar}} to {{fans of the}} television show American Idol—one candidate is eliminated after each round, and many rounds of voting are used, rather than just two. Because holding many rounds of voting on separate days is generally expensive, the <b>exhaustive</b> ballot is not used for large-scale, public elections.|$|E

25|$|This is not <b>exhaustive,</b> since any Greek letter {{may be used}} freely as a {{variable}} name.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} section, {{although not}} <b>exhaustive,</b> provides a reference {{of the major}} nationally classified monuments {{that exist in the}} municipality.|$|E
25|$|The list is by {{no means}} <b>exhaustive</b> as ongoing {{research}} may find references to other matches at the ground.|$|E
25|$|Deleuze has {{attracted}} critics as well. The following list is not <b>exhaustive,</b> and gives only the briefest of summaries.|$|E
