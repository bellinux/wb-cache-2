40|$|In {{the context}} of a star cluster moving on a {{circular}} galactic orbit, a "potential escaper" is a cluster star that has orbital energy greater than the <b>escape</b> <b>energy,</b> and yet is confined within the Jacobi radius of the stellar system. On the other hand analytic models of stellar clusters typically have a truncation energy equal to the cluster <b>escape</b> <b>energy,</b> and therefore explicitly exclude these energetically unbound stars. Starting from the landmark analysis performed by Henon of periodic orbits of the circular Hill equations, we present a numerical exploration of the population of "non-escapers", defined here as those stars which remain within two Jacobi radii for several galactic periods, with energy above the <b>escape</b> <b>energy.</b> We show that they can be characterised by the Jacobi integral and two further approximate integrals, which are based on perturbation theory and ideas drawn from Lidov-Kozai theory.

We find their simple periodic orbits, their characteristics and their stability. Then we find their ordered and chaotic domains. As the energy goes beyond the <b>escape</b> <b>energy,</b> most chaotic orbits escape. In the first case we consider escapes to infinity, while in the second case we emphasize escapes to the central "bumpy" black hole. When the energy reaches its escape value a particular family of periodic orbits reaches an infinite period and then the family disappears (the orbit escapes). As this family approaches termination it undergoes an infinity of equal period and double period bifurcations at transitions from stability to instability and vice versa.

40|$|The {{role of the}} ambipolar {{potential}} in the propulsive capability of the Gasdynamic Mirror (GDM) has been studied previously. The electrostatic potential arises {{as a result of}} the initial rapid escape of the electrons due to their small mass, leaving behind an excess of ions and creating a positive electric potential that slows down the electron escape while speeding up the ions until their respective axial diffusion are equalized. As a result, the ion confinement time is reduced while the ion <b>escape</b> <b>energy</b> is increased by an amount equal to the potential, translating into increased thrust and specific impulse. Previous studies, however, have only considered a GDM configuration with equal mirror ratios at both ends such that on average half of the ions escape through either end of the GDM. For a thruster it is desirable to bias the direction of ion escape to the thrusting end of the GDM. This can be achieved by properly controlling the mirror ratio at both ends such that on average a specified fraction of ions escape through the thrusting end. Due to this asymmetry, the magnitude of the ambipolar potential is changed, and as a result, the ion confinement time and <b>escape</b> <b>energy</b> are affected resulting in different propulsive capabilities compared to the case of a symmetric system...|$|E

At the time it was written, a copy was added to the NPS Library Collection for reasons not now known. It has been included in the digital archive for its historical value to NPS. Not believed to be a CIVINS (Civilian Institutions) title. This thesis studies {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} an expanding elliptical acceleration maneuver for a space vehicle, in chic a low level acceleration is applied tangentially for small arcs of true anomaly centered at perigee. The main advantage of this type of orbit is fuel economy. The elliptical orbit requires less than half the total thrust of an expanding circular spiral using the same acceleration. The elliptical maneuver requires much greater total time, due to the large amount of non-thrusting time in each orbit. Typical of low thrust acceleration orbits, much of the accelerating time is spent in the high density Van Allen radiation regions. For these two reasons, a vehicle which remains unmanned until <b>escape</b> <b>energy</b> is neared, is considered. The problem of orbital rendezvous and re supply is considered and deemed feasible using a single stage reuseable ferry vehicle. The acceleration orbit may be stabilized in a polar plane so that, as <b>escape</b> <b>energy</b> is neared, the orbit is completely clear of the high radiation Van Allen regions.

The technique employs high resolution, a narrow bandpass, and specific observing geometry to suppress scattered light and image lunar atmospheric Na I emission down to approximately 50 km altitude. Analysis of four latitudinally dispersed images shows that the lunar Na atmosphere exhibits intersting latitudinal and radial dependencies. Application of a simple Maxwellian collisionless exosphere model indicates that: (1) at least two thermal populations are required to adequately fit the soldium's radial intensity behavior, and (2) the fractional abundances and temperatures of the two components vary systematically with latitude.

BackgroundRadiation therapy {{is one of the}} main methods of treating localized cancer tumors. The use of high energy proton beam in radiotherapy was proposed almost 60 years ago. In recent years, there has been a revival of interest in this subject in the context of radiation therapy. High energy protons suffer little angular deflection and have a well-defined penetration range, with a sharp increase in the energy loss at the end of their trajectories, namely the Bragg peak. Materials and methodsA slab head phantom was used for the purpose of simulating proton therapy in brain tissue. In this study simulation was carried out using the Monte Carlo MCNPX code. ResultsBy using mono energetic proton pencil beams, energy depositions in tissues, especially inside the brain, as well as estimating the neutron and photon production as a result of proton interactions in the body, together with their energy spectra, were calculated or obtained. The amount of <b>energy</b> <b>escaped</b> from the head by secondary neutrons and photons was determined. ConclusionsIt was found that for high energy proton beams the amount of <b>escaped</b> <b>energy</b> by neutrons is almost 10 times larger than that by photons.

Finite temperature effects can cause radiation propagating nearly perpendicular to the magnetic field to refract, causing enhanced absorption.

40|$|In this work, {{we try to}} {{shed some}} light {{to the nature of}} orbits in a {{three-dimensional}} potential of a perturbed harmonic oscillator with eight possible channels of escape, which was chosen as an interesting example of open three-dimensional Hamiltonian systems. In particular, we conduct a thorough numerical investigation distinguishing between regular and chaotic orbits as well as between trapped and escaping orbits, considering unbounded motion for several values of the energy. In an attempt to discriminate safely and with certainty between ordered and chaotic motion, we use the Smaller ALingment Index (SALI) detector, computed by integrating numerically the basic equations of motion as well as the variational equations. Of particular interest, is to locate the basins of escape towards the different escape channels and connect them with the corresponding escape periods of the orbits. We split our study into three different cases depending on the initial value of the $z$ coordinate which was used for launching the test particles. We found, that when the orbits are started very close to the primary $(x,y) $ plane the respective grids exhibit a high degree of fractalization, while on the other hand for orbits with relatively high values of $z_ 0 $ several well-formed basins of escape emerge thus, reducing significantly the fractalization of the grids. It was also observed, that for values of energy very close to the <b>escape</b> <b>energy</b> the escape times of orbits are large, while for energy levels much higher than the <b>escape</b> <b>energy</b> the vast majority of orbits escape extremely fast or even immediately to infinity.

The matter accreting onto the black hole is unlikely to fall directly in, but will have some angular momentum around the black hole that will cause the matter to collect into an accretion disc. Quasars may also be ignited or re-ignited when normal galaxies merge and the black hole is infused with a fresh source of matter.
