Shortly after being signed by Coca-Cola, Cosby appeared at a bottlers' convention.

500|$|Crew members often {{complained about}} {{difficult}} shoots, with many quitting or being fired. Mary Parent was then brought in as a producer. Iñárritu stated {{that some of}} the crew members had left the film, explaining that [...] "as a director, if I identify a violin that is out of tune, I have to take that from the orchestra." [...] On his experience filming, DiCaprio stated: [...] "I can name 30 or 40 sequences that were some of the most difficult things I’ve ever had to do.

500|$|After {{nearly three}} hours of shouts from the angry crowd, {{officers}} moved in to quell the riot. Police reportedly covered their badges with black tape—preventing any identification—and attacked rioters. Dozens of police officers swept into the crowd, using tear gas to force protesters away from the building. Police were surprised at the resistance they faced from the protesters, who attempted to push them back using tree branches, chrome torn off city buses, and asphalt ripped from the street, as weapons. As one man ignited the last police car he shouted to a reporter [...] "Make sure {{you put in the}} paper that <b>I</b> <b>ate</b> too many Twinkies."

500|$|The {{major works}} for voices and {{orchestra}} of the twenty-one years of Elgar's middle period are three large-scale works for soloists, chorus and orchestra: The Dream of Gerontius (1900), and the oratorios The Apostles (1903) and The Kingdom (1906); and two shorter odes, the Coronation Ode (1902) and The Music Makers (1912). The {{first of the}} odes, as a pièce d'occasion, has rarely been revived after its initial success, with the culminating [...] "Land of Hope and Glory". The second is, for Elgar, unusual in that it contains several quotations from his earlier works, as Richard Strauss quoted himself in Ein Heldenleben. The choral works were all successful, although the first, Gerontius, was and remains the best-loved and most performed. On the manuscript Elgar wrote, quoting John Ruskin, [...] "This {{is the best of}} me; for the rest, <b>I</b> <b>ate,</b> and drank, and slept, loved and hated, like another. My life was as the vapour, and is not; but this I saw, and knew; this, if anything of mine, is worth your memory." [...] All three of the large-scale works follow the traditional model with sections for soloists, chorus and both together. Elgar's distinctive orchestration, as well as his melodic inspiration, lifts them to a higher level than most of their British predecessors.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the synagogue}} had {{undertaken}} innovations {{in some areas}} of Jewish law, it still insisted on strict adherence in others. In 1878 Tinter was dismissed for officiating at the marriage of a Jewish woman and Christian man, and Baith Israel was, for a time, the only congregation in Brooklyn that celebrated Jewish holidays for the traditional two days. In 1889 Baith Israel asserted it was [...] "the only orthodox congregation in the city", and that year the board forced the resignation of a Mr. J. Folkart, for transgressing the laws of Yom Kippur. In 1892, when Hyman Rosenberg was expelled as rabbi of Brooklyn's Beth Jacob synagogue for eating ham, the Brooklyn Eagle canvassed local rabbis for their views on the matter. While George Taubenhaus, rabbi of Beth Elohim stated, [...] "I do not believe my congregation would expel me if <b>I</b> <b>ate</b> ham", Baith Israel's rabbi Friedlander responded, [...] "While there are some differences between the reform and orthodox Jews, I do not think it is the place for any Jewish minister to eat ham. The reformers do not so strictly observe the old Mosaic law, but {{it does not seem to}} me a good example for a rabbi to set to his congregation." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike E. Clark {{produced}} much of Insane Clown Posse's discography {{until the}} group's sixth and seventh albums, Bizzar and Bizaar. After Clark nearly {{died from a}} collapsed lung, he became less active in the music industry, his studio not being used {{for much of the}} early decade, and the group worked with Mike Puwal on their eighth and ninth albums, [...] and Hell's Pit. In 2006, Clark returned to Psychopathic Records and produced the group's tenth studio album, The Tempest in 2007, but did not work with the group directly. Bang! Pow! Boom! was the first album which Clark worked on directly with Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler since Bizaar. Bang! Pow! Boom! was recorded between September 2008 and July 2009 at Clark's Fun House Studio. Bruce listened to music by the progressive rock band Gong for inspiration. In order to ensure the quality of their vocal recordings, Bruce and Utsler drank tea before every take and didn't smoke cannabis while recording. Much material was recorded for the album; some songs left off the initial release appeared on the [...] "Nuclear Edition" [...] reissue, while another song intended for Bang! Pow! Boom!, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Ate</b> Your Brains", was released as part of a single for the 2009 Hallowicked concert.|$|E

2500|$|Although Jack {{grew up in}} the South, he {{said that}} {{segregation}} was not an issue in the somewhat secluded city of Galveston, as everyone living in Galveston’s 12th Ward was poor and went through the same struggles. Johnson remembers growing up with a [...] "gang" [...] of white boys, in which he never felt victimized or excluded. Remembering his childhood, Johnson said, [...] "As I grew up, the white boys were my friends and my pals. <b>I</b> <b>ate</b> with them, played with them and slept at their homes. Their mothers gave me cookies, and <b>I</b> <b>ate</b> at their tables. No one ever taught me that white men were superior to me."

2500|$|The book Frustrated Witness, {{written by}} former Miami Herald writer Willis Morgan, {{examines}} the Walsh case and cites circumstantial evidence that suggests Jeffrey Dahmer may have killed Adam Walsh. At {{the time of}} Walsh's murder, Dahmer was living a short drive away in Miami Beach and working at a sub shop where he had access to a blue van {{similar to the one}} seen leaving the mall after Walsh's disappearance. A number of witnesses reported seeing a man looking like Dahmer at the mall talking to young boys. When interviewed about Adam in the early 1990s, Dahmer repeatedly denied involvement in the crime, even stating; [...] "I've told you everything—how I killed them, how I cooked them, who <b>I</b> <b>ate.</b> Why wouldn't I tell you if I did someone else?" [...] After this rumor surfaced, John Walsh stated that he had [...] "seen no evidence" [...] linking his son's kidnapping and murder to Dahmer.|$|E
2500|$|No {{account of}} my {{childhood}} {{would be complete without}} mentioning the eunuchs. They waited on me when <b>I</b> <b>ate,</b> dressed and slept; they accompanied me on my walks and to my lessons; they told me stories; and had rewards and beatings from me, but they never left my presence. They were my slaves; and they were my earliest teachers. The eunuchs were all slaves who did all of the work in the Forbidden City such as cooking, gardening, cleaning, entertaining guests, and all of the bureaucratic work needed to govern a vast empire and serving as the emperor's advisers. The eunuchs spoke in a distinctive high-pitched voice and to further prove that they were really eunuchs had to keep their severed penises and testicles in jars of brine that they wore around their necks when working. The Forbidden City was full of treasures, which the eunuchs were constantly stealing and selling on the black market. The business of government and of providing for the emperor created further opportunities for corruption and virtually all of the eunuchs engaged in theft and corruption of one sort or another.|$|E

2500|$|According to a later account, which Searle {{presents}} in Intentionality (1983) {{and which}} differs {{in important ways}} from the one suggested in Speech Acts, illocutionary acts are characterised by their having [...] "conditions of satisfaction" [...] (an idea adopted from Strawson's 1971 paper [...] "Meaning and Truth") and a [...] "direction of fit" [...] (an idea adopted from Elizabeth Anscombe). For example, the statement [...] "John bought two candy bars" [...] is satisfied {{if and only if}} it is true, i.e. John did buy two candy bars. By contrast, the command [...] "John, buy two candy bars!" [...] is satisfied if and only if John carries out the action of purchasing two candy bars. Searle refers to the first as having the [...] "word-to-world" [...] direction of fit, since the words are supposed to change to accurately represent the world, and the second as having the [...] "world-to-word" [...] direction of fit, since the world is supposed to change to match the words. (There is also the double direction of fit, in which the relationship goes both ways, and the null or zero direction of fit, in which it goes neither way because the propositional content is presupposed, as in [...] "I'm sorry <b>I</b> <b>ate</b> John's candy bars.") ...|$|E
2500|$|Bacall {{came for}} the four-month-plus duration, leaving their young child {{to be cared for}} in L.A. The Bogarts started the trip with a junket through Europe, {{including}} a visit with Pope Pius XII. [...] Later, the glamor would be gone and Bacall would make herself useful as a cook, nurse and clothes washer, earning her husband's praise: [...] "I don't know what we'd have done without her. She Luxed my undies in darkest Africa". [...] Just about everyone in the cast came down with dysentery except Bogart and Huston, who subsisted on canned food and alcohol. Bogart explained: [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>ate</b> was baked beans, canned asparagus and Scotch whisky. Whenever a fly bit Huston or me, it dropped dead." [...] Hepburn, a teetotaler in and out of character, fared worse in the difficult conditions, losing weight and at one point falling very ill. Bogart resisted Huston's insistence on using real leeches in a key scene where Charlie has to drag his steam launch through an infested marsh, until reasonable fakes were employed. In the end, the crew overcame illness, soldier ant invasions, leaking boats, poor food, attacking hippos, poor water filters, fierce heat, isolation, and a boat fire to complete a memorable film. Despite the discomfort of jumping from the boat into swamps, rivers and marshes the film apparently rekindled Bogart's early love of boats. On his return to California he bought a classic mahogany Hacker-Craft runabout, which he kept until his death.|$|E
