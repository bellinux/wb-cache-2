40|$|This {{project was}} {{undertaken}} {{with an interest}} in the fact that boat building materials and manufacturing processes have been improving over the years, however recently there has been a definite decrease in the amount of new technology being used in production boat building. The aim then was to determine the reasons for this, and namely, to investigate why <b>stitched</b> <b>fabrics</b> are not being used more widely throughout the production boat building industry. Attention was drawn firstly to the design of composite structures using these reinforcements, followed by the manufacturing processes used to apply them. Consideration was given to any barriers to new technology, including any health and safety drawbacks and structural issues. Test panels were then constructed, one of each reinforcement type, Chopped Strand Mat and Woven Roving, Double Bias <b>stitched</b> <b>fabric,</b> and Quadriaxial <b>stitched</b> <b>fabric.</b> These panels were then cut into samples and tested for flexural properties and fibre content at the Southampton Solent University Test Labs. Using the obtained mechanical properties a case study was then carried out using Lloyds Register Special Service Craft software, investigating design with both in plane and flexural properties, which then lead onto discussion as to stiffness, thickness, mass and cost. From the investigation it was concluded that <b>stitched</b> <b>fabrics</b> are not used more widely in the production boat building industry because the budget does not allow for the amount of design work required to use the reinforcements to their full potential, or the cost of the reinforcement itself. Furthermore, CSM / WR produces a laminate almost as stiff as the stitched equivalent, builds up thickness more quickly due to the lower fibre content, and requires much less design work as it is so established. Classification societies require a certain thickness, however this is governed by robustness, and therefore the ability to build up thickness is desirable. <b>Stitched</b> <b>fabrics</b> increase mechanical properties, however the thickness required to pass criteria requires several more layers than CSM / WR, and the stresses in a hull structure are relatively low...|$|R

Two potential choices of front skin have been identified for the sandwich structure: 3 mm thick AA 5086 -H 111 aluminium plates and dry aramid <b>stitched</b> <b>fabrics</b> (between 8 and 18 plies). The dry <b>stitched</b> <b>fabrics</b> appear to be an original solution, which associates a lightweight structure and a good perforation resistance.

40|$|This work {{is aimed}} at {{modelling}} the deformation kinematics of both woven and <b>stitched</b> dry <b>fabrics</b> from a micro and mesoscopic perspective with {{the ultimate goal of}} developing constitutive models. The method behind the current approach is to analyse individually, distinct mechanisms of energy storage and dissipation for the deformation of dry fabrics and sum the resulting predictions to determine the overall force versus shear angle behaviour of the fabric. Certain energy dissipation mechanisms have been found to apply both to woven and <b>stitched</b> dry <b>fabrics.</b> One such mechanism can be identified as ‘crossover shear’. This mechanism was first treated in relation to the deformation of viscous woven textile composites. The crossover shear energy dissipation can be shown to be {{a direct result of the}} heterogeneous shear strain profile typically observed across the surface of sheared fabrics. In the first part of this paper, this crossover shear mechanism is adapted to dry fabrics, from viscous composites. Initially, the simpler case of a woven dry fabric is treated and discussed. Following this, the possibility of extending the model to the case of <b>stitched</b> dry <b>fabrics</b> is addressed. The second part of this paper focuses on the deformation kinematics of <b>stitched</b> <b>fabrics.</b> A meso-mechanical unit cell, based on the <b>fabric’s</b> <b>stitch</b> geometry is proposed and is used to model the shear behaviour of warp-knit non-crimp fabrics (NCFs). In particular, the model predicts the asymmetric draping behaviour observed in certain NCFs that is directly attributable to the <b>fabric</b> <b>stitching.</b> Finally, predictions from the crossover shear model, the unit cell stitch model and a compaction model are combined and the results are compared with experimental measurements...|$|R

40|$|The nesting of {{reinforcements}} in textile laminates is studied using a 3 D {{geometrical model}} of a woven, braided and non-crimp <b>stitched</b> <b>fabrics</b> in the relaxed and sheared state. The following fabric parameters were varied in the numerical experiments: flatness of the yarns, tightness and balance of the fabric, fabric weaving/braiding/knitted pattern, number of layers and degree of shear. Monte-Carlo modelling of the random nesting generated data on the influence these parameters on the average laminate thickness and fibre volume fraction and distributions of these characteristics of the laminate. The {{results show that the}} nesting effect becomes more pronounced with the decrease of the fabric tightness and the decrease of the float length in the weave. For non-circular yarns, an average dimension of the cross-section proved to be a valid normalizing parameter to generalize the nesting behaviour of fabrics. Shear deformation of the fabric decreases the nesting. For non-crimp <b>stitched</b> <b>fabrics</b> the nesting is defined by the stitching pattern. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The ballistic test results exhibit that the polymer composites have ballistic resistance against 7. 62 mm fragment simulating projectiles (FSP) up to 1001 m/s projectile velocities. However, the composites without any support layer are not sufficient to stop AP projectiles. The sandwich panels containing ceramic tiles subjected to the ballistic impact by AP and FSP projectiles exhibited only partial penetrations at all the velocities applied within the study (446 - 1020 m/s with AP and 435 - 1173 m/s with FSP). The extensions of damages in the composites were evaluated after impact.

The results show poorer than expected fatigue performance for laminates composed of stranded fabrics at (a) high fiber contents and (b) high relative amounts of ± 45 E reinforcement. Optimum fatigue resistant materials appropriate for both flange areas and webs of blades are identified. Laminates which fall into the poor fatigue resistance category (similar to woven <b>fabrics</b> and triax <b>stitched</b> <b>fabrics)</b> do not behave in a fiber-dominated manner which is required for application of the high cycle DOE/MSU database to lifetime prediction as described in Ref.

5000|$|Cross-stitch {{is a form}} of sewing and {{a popular}} form of counted-thread {{embroidery}} in which X-shaped stitches in a tiled, raster-like pattern are used to form a picture. The stitcher counts the threads on a piece of evenweave fabric (such as linen) in each direction so that the stitches are of uniform size and appearance. This form of cross-stitch is also called counted cross-stitch in order to distinguish it from other forms of cross-stitch. Sometimes cross-stitch is done on designs printed on the fabric (stamped cross-stitch); the stitcher simply stitches over the printed pattern. Cross-stitch is also executed on easily countable fabric called aida cloth but the threads are not actually counted.Fabrics used in cross-stitch include linen, aida, and mixed-content fabrics called 'evenweave' such as jobelan. All cross <b>stitch</b> <b>fabrics</b> are technically [...] "evenweave" [...] as the term refers {{to the fact that the}} fabric is woven to make sure that there are the same number of threads in an inch both left to right and top to bottom (vertically and horizontally). Fabrics are categorized by threads per inch (referred to as 'count'), which can range from 11 to 40 count. Aida fabric has a lower count because it is made with two threads grouped together for ease of stitching. Cross stitch projects are worked from a gridded pattern and can be used on any count fabric, the count of the fabric determines the size of the finished stitching if the stitchers counts and stitches over 2 threads. The finished stitching size is reduced by half if the stitcher counts and <b>stitches</b> over one <b>fabric</b> thread. These methods are commonly referred to as [...] "2 over 2" [...] - i.e. 2 embroidery threads used to <b>stitch</b> over 2 <b>fabric</b> threads; and [...] "1 over 1" [...] - i.e. 1 embroidery thread used to <b>stitch</b> over 1 <b>fabric</b> thread. There are different methods of stitching a pattern, including the cross-country method where one colour is stitched at a time, or the parking method where one block of <b>fabric</b> is <b>stitched</b> at a time and the end of the thread is [...] "parked" [...] at the next point the same colour occurs in the pattern.|$|R
