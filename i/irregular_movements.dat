6000|$|Solanum dulcamara {{is one of}} the feeblest and {{poorest of}} twiners: it may often be seen growing as an upright bush, and when growing {{in the midst of a}} thicket merely scrambles up between the {{branches}} without twining; but when, according to Dutrochet (tom. xix. p. 299), it grows near a thin and flexible support, such as the stem of a nettle, it twines round it. I placed sticks round several plants, and vertically stretched strings close to others, and the strings alone were ascended by twining. The stem twines indifferently to the right or left. Some others species of Solanum, and of another genus, viz. Habrothamnus, belonging to the same family, are described in horticultural works as twining plants, but they seem to possess this faculty in a very feeble degree. We may suspect that the species of these two genera have as yet only partially acquired the habit of twining. On the other hand with Tecoma radicans, a member of a family abounding with twiners and tendril-bearers, but which climbs, like the ivy, by the aid of rootlets, we may suspect that a former habit of twining has been lost, for the stem exhibited slight <b>irregular</b> <b>movements</b> which could hardly be accounted for by changes in the action of the light. There is no difficulty in understanding how a spirally twining plant could graduate into a simple root-climber; for the young internodes of Bignonia Tweedyana and of Hoya carnosa revolve and twine, but likewise emit rootlets which adhere to any fitting surface, so that the loss of twining would be no great disadvantage and in some respects an advantage to these species, as they would then ascend their supports in a more direct line. {20} ...|$|E

50|$|Globus pallidusFrom recent studies, {{it is now}} {{thought that}} hemiballismus can be {{associated}} with a decreased output of the globus pallidus. This is because studies have shown that firing rates decrease from 70/s to 40/s. In addition to a decreased firing rate, degenerative neurological disorders that cause patients to exhibit hemiballistic movements show a marked decrease in the globus pallidus mass as well. Increases in activity in this area causes there to be an inhibition of the motor thalamus. This causes cortical activation and thus a movement inhibition. In the case of hemiballismus, the opposite occurs, leading to the characteristic large, <b>irregular</b> <b>movements.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Holmes tremor is {{typically}} {{characterized by a}} low frequency tremor (below 4.5 Hz) that has a repeated series of rest and intention tremors. These tremors move slowly and are generally specific to an upper area of the body. They can consist of postural tremors in nearby muscles as well. These tremors involve uncontrollable shaking despite efforts to be still. [...] Holmes tremor is considered a rest-intention posture tremor. These <b>irregular</b> <b>movements</b> occur while muscles are at rest, but worsen during voluntary muscle contractions. Symptoms usually appear delayed one to twenty-four months after the lesion is created.|$|E
5000|$|In ophthalmology, horror fusionis is a {{condition}} in which the eyes have an unsteady deviation, with the extraocular muscles performing spasm-like movements that continuously shift the eyes away from the position in which they would be directed to the same point in space, giving rise to diplopia. Even when the double vision images are made to nearly overlap using optical means such as prisms, the <b>irregular</b> <b>movements</b> prevent binocular fusion. The name horror fusionis (Latin phrase literally meaning [...] "fear of fusion") arises from the notion that the brain is, or at least appears to be, actively preventing binocular fusion.|$|E
50|$|With {{the idea}} of the Moving Attack Surface, (MAS), the CMD system can be {{regarded}} as a kind of proactive defense system which deploys the multi-dimensional attack surface in an unpredictable way under the condition of visually-unchanged functions. Due to multiple-heterogeneity of structures and environments from each executive entity, it enables resources exploited by attackers (including lurkers) to have uncertainty in temporal and spatial dimensions. At the macro level, it appears that the attack surface is always making <b>irregular</b> <b>movements.</b> Especially for those attack missions which need multiple steps to transmit data to achieve attack goals, the premise of achievability can hardly be guaranteed.|$|E

5000|$|Galileo had {{discovered}} the moons of Jupiter in 1609. Scheiner argued that {{what appeared to be}} spots on the sun were in fact clusters of small moons, thereby trying to deploy one of Galileo's own discoveries as an argument for the Aristotelian model. [...] In his Letters on Sunspots Galileo showed how sunspots were nothing like the moons of Jupiter, and the comparison was false. Scheiner claimed that the sunspots, with their <b>irregular</b> <b>movements,</b> were like the moons of Jupiter whose positions were similarly hard to predict. To counter this argument, Galileo published tables of predictions for the future position of the moons of Jupiter, so that astronomers could easily distinguish between the regular, predictable movements they followed with the ephemeral and irregular sunspots.|$|E

5000|$|Gogo was {{a type of}} francophone {{music that}} was popular in the 1960s in Quebec, Canada. It {{accompanied}} dancing that was characterised by lively, quick and <b>irregular</b> <b>movements</b> {{of the body and}} wide gestures of the arms. The words and music were often adapted from contemporary hits of pop music from the United States (with or without permission and payment of royalties to the creators or rights-holders of the original music). The dance clubs “boîtes à gogo” that catered to it gave way to discothèques when the fashion for gogo gave way to disco {{at the beginning of the}} 1970s. In 1966, the Quebec singer Michèle Richard recorded a song titled [...] "Les Boîtes à Gogo", whose accompanying 16mm Scopitone film illustrates both the dance style and the atmosphere in these clubs.|$|E

The European Union is facing the complicated question of how to retain security and sovereignty while protecting human life. The objective of this thesis is to assess the different approaches to tackle the problem of people smuggling on the external borders of the European Union. This is done by analysing two main proposed policies, one of which focuses on limiting the supply of smuggling services while the other focuses on limiting the demand for smuggling services. The thesis will assess the expected effectiveness and (un) intended consequences of both policy options. The result of this thesis show that the combination of limiting the supply of smuggling services and limiting the demand for smuggling services is the best combination in order to fight human smuggling in the Mediterranean Sea...|$|R
50|$|In murgha parade, {{the person}} in {{addition}} to being in murga position, has to walk. It is almost impossible to walk in sitting murgha, so for all practical purpose it must be done in standing murgha. This can be extremely tiring for both legs, hands and back. Recall that standing murgha is very severe by itself. Add to it having to walk and it becomes really tough. It also hurts the ears because of <b>irregular</b> <b>movements.</b> For these reasons, an average person can only do this for a very short period, usually not {{more than a couple of}} minutes, and that too with a lot of difficulty and pain.

40|$|The usual {{estimation}} methods provide only a blurred {{picture of the}} cyclical development for the current values of a time series, the section that is of most interest for short-term economic analysis. As an alternative, an approach to identify first signs of a development toward a cyclical turning point is suggested. The method {{is based on the}} moving adaptation of a parabola to predetermined sections of time series and determines a change in the curve of the consecutive parabolas as a first signal of a turning point. The different features of economic time series call for a time series specific design of the method. Some measures, like the determination of the length of the parabola or the moderation of the <b>irregular</b> <b>movement</b> in advance, allow a certain turning. On principle, the lead and the reliability of the signals decrease with the share of the <b>irregular</b> <b>movement</b> on the variance of the time series and increase with the smoothness of its cyclical development.
