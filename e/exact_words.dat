5|$|The Portopia Serial Murder Incident {{follows a}} first-person {{perspective}} and narrative. The various events are described with still pictures and text messages. The player {{interacts with the}} game using a verb-noun parser which requires typing precise commands with the keyboard. Finding the <b>exact</b> <b>words</b> to type is {{considered part of the}} riddles that must be solved. While sound effects are present, the game lacks music and a save function. It features a conversation system with branching dialogue choices, where the story develops through entering commands and receiving answers to them from the player's sidekick or non-player characters.|$|E

Due to this mixed origin, the text has been examined in an attempt to sort out the sources for the information it presents.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in Renaissance Italy, a new {{period in}} the history of {{translation}} had opened in Florence with the arrival, at the court of Cosimo de' Medici, of the Byzantine scholar Georgius Gemistus Pletho shortly before the fall of Constantinople to the Turks (1453). A Latin translation of Plato's works was undertaken by Marsilio Ficino. This and Erasmus' Latin edition of the New Testament led to a new attitude to translation. For the first time, readers demanded rigor of rendering, as philosophical and religious beliefs depended on the <b>exact</b> <b>words</b> of Plato, Aristotle and Jesus.|$|E

25|$|On 28 August 2008, Hervé Eon, from Laval {{came to an}} anti-Sarkozy {{demonstration}} with a sign {{bearing the}} words Casse-toi pov' con, the <b>exact</b> <b>words</b> Sarkozy had uttered. Eon was arrested for causing offence to the presidential function and the prosecutor, who in France indirectly reports to the president, requested a fine of €1000. The court eventually imposed a symbolic €30 suspended fine, which has generally been interpreted as a defeat for the prosecution side. This incident was widely reported on, in particular as Sarkozy, {{as president of the}} Republic, is immune from prosecution, notably restricting Eon's rights to sue Sarkozy for defamation.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} {{where all of}} the Congress {{leadership}} were in jail, the Muslim League under Jinnah grew in power. In April 1943, the League captured the governments of Bengal and, a month later, that of the North West Frontier Province. In none of these provinces had the League previously had a majority – only the arrest of Congress members made it possible. With all the Muslim dominated provinces except the Punjab under Jinnah's control, the artificial concept of a separate Muslim State was turning into a reality. However, by 1944, Jinnah's power and prestige were on the wane. A general sympathy towards the jailed Congress leaders was developing among Muslims, {{and much of the}} blame for the disastrous Bengal famine of 1943–44 during which two million died, had been laid on the shoulders of the province's Muslim League government. The numbers at Jinnah's meetings, once counted in thousands soon numbered only a few hundreds. In despair, Jinnah left the political scene for a stay in Kashmir. His prestige was restored unwittingly by Gandhi, who had been released from prison on medical grounds in May 1944 and had met Jinnah in Bombay in September. There he offered the Muslim leader a plebiscite in the Muslim areas after the war to see whether they wanted to separate from the rest of India. Essentially, it was an acceptance of the principle of Pakistan – but not in so many words. Jinnah demanded that the <b>exact</b> <b>words</b> be said; Gandhi refused and the talks broke down. Jinnah, however, had greatly strengthened his own position and that of the League. The most influential member of Congress had been seen to negotiate with him on equal terms. Other Muslim League leaders, opposed both to Jinnah and to the partition of India, lost strength.|$|E

500|$|All {{television}} match players wore small microphones so {{that their}} words {{and the sounds of}} play could be heard by the audience. After Bell's second 9 ball break, Balukas reportedly muttered within the range of the microphone words to the effect that Bell was having a string of inordinately lucky shots. She was cautioned by the referee and play continued, with Balukas the ultimate victor with a final score of 9–5. According to an interview with Balukas appearing in New York Woman magazine in 1991, Balukas's <b>exact</b> <b>words</b> were [...] "Some world championship... beat me with skill, not luck." [...] Despite their off-the-table friendship, following the match Bell made a formal complaint to the WPBA about the incident. The WPBA's board of directors thereafter sanctioned Balukas $200 for unsportsmanlike conduct.|$|E

Goldman began speaking to crowds of frustrated {{men and women in}} New York City. On August 21, she spoke to a crowd of nearly 3,000 people in Union Square, where she encouraged unemployed workers to take immediate action.

If they do not give you work, demand bread. If they deny you both, take bread." [...] Later in court, Detective-Sergeant Charles Jacobs offered yet another version of her speech.|$|E

500|$|In November 1908, Macmillan {{appeared}} in London to argue, as a university graduate, for {{her right to}} vote for Scottish University seats. During her speech, the buildings of Parliament were made to suspend the temporary arrangements {{put in place to}} prevent women from entering—such arrangements had been instituted after the first militant suffrage agitations. Macmillan was the first woman to argue a case before the bar of the House of Lords. She was backed by her contemporary, Frances Simson, one of the first eight female graduates of Edinburgh. Given audience late in the day, Macmillan spoke for three quarters of an hour. Press reports of the appearance described her as a [...] "modern Portia." [...] In Scotland, Glasgow's The Herald reported that she began nervously but warmed to her subject and [...] "argued law in an admirable speaking voice". Two days later she continued to plead her case, this time in [...] "complete self-possession", wearing a dark red outfit and hat trimmed with ermine furs. Like other suffragists in Britain and the United States, she based her case on the words person and persons in the voting statutes, arguing that such unspecific words were no basis for the exclusion of one entire sex from voting. The court upheld both lower courts' decisions that the word persons did not include women when referring to privileges granted by the state. She lost the case, but The New York Times reported that she responded to the decision against her with the words [...] "We'll live to fight another day". In Wellington, New Zealand, the Evening Post wrote a less strident account, noting that Macmillan was cheerful in defeat. After the court adjourned, she said to a reporter from the London Daily Chronicle, [...] "I don't suppose that there is anything more to be done just now, but we shall live to fight another day." [...] No matter her <b>exact</b> <b>words,</b> her time at the House of Lords attracted worldwide publicity which proved valuable to the women's cause.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the Minimum <b>Exact</b> <b>Word</b> Error (exactMWE) {{training}} criterion to optimise {{the parameters of}} large scale speech recognition systems. The exactMWE criterion {{is similar to the}} Minimum Word Error (MWE) criterion but uses the <b>exact</b> <b>word</b> error instead of an approximation based on time alignments as used in the MWE criterion. It is shown that the <b>exact</b> <b>word</b> error for all word sequence hypotheses can be represented on a word lattice. This can be accomplished using transducer-based methods. The result is a word lattice of slightly refined topology. The accumulated weights of each path through such a lattice then represent the <b>exact</b> number of <b>word</b> errors for the corresponding word sequence hypothesis. Using this compressed representation of the word error of all word sequences represented in the original lattice, exactMWE can be performed using the same latticebased re-estimation process as for MWE training. First experiments on the Wall Street Journal dictation task do not show significant differences in recognition performance between exactMWE and MWE at comparable computational complexity and convergence behaviour of the training. 1...|$|R
