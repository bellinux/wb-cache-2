40|$|International audiencePURPOSE:This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{serious side effects}} of the pupillary dilation protocol used in Caen University Hospital for the screening of retinopathy of prematurity. This protocol includes one drop of phenylephrine 5 % and two drops of tropicamide 0. 5 % instilled at a 5 -minute interval. PATIENTS AND METHODS:This retrospective study included all premature infants with a birth weight {{less than or equal}} to 1500 g and/or a gestational age {{less than or equal to}} 30 gestational weeks, hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit of Caen University Medical Center, having ocular fundus examinations for retinopathy of prematurity screening between 2009 and 2014. The medical records of patients who died or developed necrotizing enterocolitis were reviewed to analyze the <b>imputability</b> of the two eye drops used for pupil dilation. RESULTS:Five-hundred and twelve infants were included, corresponding to 1033 ocular fundus examinations. No case of death could be ascribed to the use of eye drops. Two cases of necrotizing enterocolitis could be ascribed to the use of tropicamide with a doubtful and plausible intrinsic <b>imputability</b> according to French <b>imputability</b> criteria. CONCLUSION:The pupillary dilation protocol used in Caen University Hospital for screening of retinopathy of prematurity might be implicated in two cases of necrotizing enterocolitis with an uncertain <b>imputability</b> of tropicamide 0. 5 % eye drops.

40|$|Motivation: Genotype {{imputation}} {{has become}} an indispensible step in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Imputation accuracy, directly influencing downstream analysis, has shown to be improved using re-sequencing-based reference panels; however, this comes {{at the cost of}} high computational burden due to the huge number of potentially imputable markers (tens of millions) discovered through sequencing a large number of individuals. Therefore, there is an increasing need for access to imputation quality information without actually conducting imputation. To facilitate this process, we have established a publicly available SNP and indel <b>imputability</b> database, aiming to provide direct access to imputation accuracy information for markers identified by the 1000 Genomes Project across four major populations and covering multiple GWAS genotyping platforms.

40|$|Responsibility {{is a key}} {{concept in}} {{philosophy}} and theol-ogy, and also in practice, not least in business and {{the management of the}} environment. It is a concept {{at the heart of the}} writings of Fethullah Gülen, and this paper will explore his meaning and use of responsibility, and how that con-tributes to the wider debates. This paper will first involve an analysis of responsibility in terms of <b>imputability,</b> accountability and liability. I will argue that Gülen’s view of responsibility is anchored in accountabili-ty, and that this is based in his creation- and action-centred theology. His view of <b>imputability,</b> focused in agency and responsiveness, emerges from that, leading to a perspective of universal liability that is significant. I will compare this view on responsibility to other philosophers and theologians of other faiths, including H. Richard Niebuhr, Bonheoffer, Bauman, Novak, Schweiker and Nasr. The paper will then examine Gülen’s view of responsibil-ity in different contexts, including civic society, education, and business. It will compare these with other approaches, and con-sider the role of Gülen in contemporary debates in these areas. The paper includes a critique on Gülen’s view of responsi-bility and considers developments, not least the relationship of responsibility to dialogue. It concludes that Gülen’s view of responsibility provides a critical bridge to public discourse and practice in this area...|$|E
40|$|Pretendo {{discutir}} o modo como Kant relaciona os conceitos de liberdade e moralidade na FMC. Neste livro, Kant afirma que "vontade livre e vontade submetida a leis morais são uma e mesma coisa" (FMC III: § 2 /BA 98). Aparentemente apenas a vontade autônoma seria livre, não restando outra alternativa que não seja assimilar a vontade heterônoma à necessidade natural. Essa conseqüência provocaria certamente um embargo da imputabilidade das ações imorais. Quero defender que, embora Kant tenha obscurecido as distinções entre vontade livre e vontade moral, se nos ativermos à analise do conceito de vontade em FMC II: § 12 (BA 36 - 37), poderemos defender que não apenas a autonomia, mas também a heteronomia é livremente escolhida, tornando inteligível, assim, a imputabilidade dos atos imorais. Sustento, portanto, que é possível, apesar das ambigüidades de Kant, pensar a imputabilidade moral a partir de recursos conceituais internos à Fundamentação. Desse modo, não será necessário invocar a distinção entre Wille e Willkür desenvolvida na MC, nem mesmo outras obras para dar conta deste problema. I {{intend to}} discuss the way as Kant relates the concepts of freedom and morality in the Foundations. In this book, Kant argues that" free will and will submitted to moral laws are one and same". Apparently just the autonomous will would be free, not remaining other alternative {{that is not to}} assimilate the heteronomous will to the natural necessity. That consequence would provoke an embargo of the <b>imputability</b> of immoral actions. I want to defend that, although Kant has obscure the distinctions between free will and moral will, if we concentrate on analyzes of the concept of will in Foundations II, we can defend that not just the autonomy, but the heteronomy is also chosen freely, turning intelligible, like this, the <b>imputability</b> of immoral acts. I sustain, therefore, that it's possible, in spite of the ambiguities of Kant, to think the moral <b>imputability</b> starting from internal conceptual resources to Foundations. Thus, it won't be necessary to invoke the distinction between Wille and Willkür, not even other works to solve this problem...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Gabapentin and {{pregabalin}} {{are widely}} used as antineuropathic pain drugs. Their use is also associated {{with the development of}} adverse drug reactions (ADRs), mainly neuropsychiatric. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to study 'serious' and/or 'unexpected' adverse reactions associated with pregabalin and gabapentin. STUDY DESIGN: We studied ADRs reported to the French Pharmacovigilance System occurring between 1995 and 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: For each ADR associated with gabapentin or pregabalin, we noted year, patient age and sex, type of adverse reaction, as well as the <b>imputability</b> score. Reporting rate of serious ADRs for gabapentin and pregabalin was estimated with regard to data of use (obtained from the French National Health Insurance Fund) using the defined daily dose. A global and descriptive analysis of the adverse reactions for each drug is presented. Secondly, details of deaths and ADRs with an <b>imputability</b> score of at least 'probable' or 'likely' were presented. RESULTS: Overall, 1333 cases were recorded (725 related to gabapentin, 608 related to pregabalin), mainly neuropsychiatric ADRs. Among the 22 deaths recorded, 8 were related to gabapentin in obstetrical situations. Other less well-documented ADRs were identified, such as hepatitis associated with gabapentin and haematological ADRs associated with pregabalin. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the prevalence of neuropsychiatric ADRs associated with gabapentin or pregabalin. A high rate of death occurred with gabapentin in an obstetrical context. New adverse reactions have been noted, such as haematological or hepatic adverse reactions associated with pregabalin and gabapentin, respectively...|$|E

40|$|The {{profound}} {{transformation of}} the Romanian society and the contemporary European realities imposed the adaptation {{of the rule of}} civil law to meet the new cultural, economic, scientific and socio-moral values. Expected with great enthusiasm, or on the contrary with skepticism, the emergence of the current Civil Code and its enforcement on 1 October 2011 sparked lively debates in the legal world. Regarded as a modern tool to regulate fundamental aspects of the individual and social existence, adapted to modern terminology, the current Civil Code is, after the Romanian Constitution, the most important normative act, both in extent and in terms of content, regulating the human relations even before the birth of the person, as owner of rights and obligations, and until after death. Our research has set an objective: the study of the current liability regulations regarding the institution of civil liability in general and tort liability, in particular. In our assessment, the institution of tort liability finds itself in a thorough transformation {{to meet the needs of}} the modern society. On these coordinates, the current Civil Code reaffirms the idea of subjective liability conditioned by proving the fault of the responsible person. However, countless law assumptions of objective liability, independent of any guilt, were regulated in the positive law. In doctrine we discuss the possibility of interpreting the “guilt” from an objective position: the abnormality of the offender’s behavior and, in a lesser extent, the <b>imputability</b> of his deed. We appreciate that the main objective of tort liability must be to support the interests of innocent victims. In this way, we consider the possible transfer of the legal, ethical and moral debates, from the subjective level to the objective level, respectively regarding the act causing the harm, as the defining element of tort liabilitytort liability, Romanian Civil Code, guilt, <b>imputability...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{literature}} review {{was conducted in}} relation to a case of chronic diarrhea associated with a VIP (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide) producing ganglioneuroblastoma (GNB), in an 18 -month old female baby. This is a rare entity characterized by premonitory, persisting diarrhea, causing fluid and electrolyte changes typical of the WDHA syndrome, associating watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydia. Elevated VIP plasma levels are an indication for an echographic and/or CT-scan search for the causal secreting tumor. Although the prognosis of this condition seems favorable, the recommended treatment is surgery. The VIP substance represents an excellent biological monitoring marker. Ganglioneuroblastomas are tumors of the sympathetic nervous system, which, according to Pearse's cell and embryologic theory (1966), have to be linked to the APUD system tumors (paraneuromas). VIP-producing forms are rare in children, and only 29 case studies have been compiled in the literature since 1970, when the VIP substance was discovered.
