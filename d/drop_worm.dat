60|$|MacRummle <b>dropped</b> a <b>worm</b> {{gently into}} {{the head of}} the pool, and let it go with the current. Instantly the line straightened, the rod bent, the reel spun, and {{from the other side of}} the pool there leaped a lovely bar of silver, which fell back to its native element with a {{considerable}} splash.|$|R
50|$|Beaver Lake {{is heavily}} fished by locals. Many trout are caught from shore, {{but it is}} best for any species with a boat. Trout are found mostly in the main and larger sister lake. Bass are caught {{consistently}} in Beaver's many lily pads and fallen timber areas, and are abundant in the smaller, shallower sister lake. Perch are found all over, and <b>dropping</b> a <b>worm</b> under a dock produces many of them.|$|R
6000|$|HOWARD. [...] O Paget, Paget! I {{have seen}} heretics of the poorer sort, Expectant of the rack {{from day to}} day, To whom the fire were welcome, lying chain'd In breathless dungeons over {{steaming}} sewers, Fed with rank bread that crawl'd upon the tongue, And putrid water, every <b>drop</b> a <b>worm,</b> Until they died of rotted limbs; and then Cast on the dunghill naked, and become Hideously alive again from head to heel, Made even the carrion-nosing mongrel vomit With hate and horror.|$|R
60|$|As the day {{advanced}} the heat became overpowering, and, {{to escape from}} the glare of the sun for a little, the fisher took shelter under some very tall bracken on the bank near a deep pool. In order to secure a slight feeling of pleasurable expectation while resting, he put on a bait-cast, <b>dropped</b> the <b>worm</b> into the deepest part of the pool, propped up his rod with several stones, and then lay down to watch. The turf happened to be soft and level. As a natural consequence the tired man fell sound asleep.|$|R
40|$|Network telescopes {{have been}} {{invaluable}} for collecting information about dynamics of large-scale worm events. Yet, a telescope’s observation may be incomplete due to scan congestion drops, hardware limitations, filtering and presence of NATs, a worm’s non-uniform scanning strategy or its short life. We investigate inaccuracies in telescope observations {{that arise from}} worm-induced congestion <b>drops</b> of <b>worm</b> scans and show that they may lead to significant underestimates {{of the number of}} infectees and their scanning rate. We propose a method to infer worm-induced congestion drops from telescope’s observations and use them to accurately estimate global worm dynamics. We apply our methods to CAIDA telescope’s observations of Witty worm’s spread, and release corrected statistics of worm dynamics for public use...|$|R
50|$|Angels {{also helped}} Solomon in {{building}} the Temple; though not by choice. The edifice was, according to rabbinical legend, miraculously constructed throughout, the large heavy stones rising and settling in their respective places of themselves. The general opinion of the Rabbis is that Solomon hewed the stones {{by means of a}} shamir, a mythical worm whose mere touch cleft rocks. According to Midrash Tehillim, the shamir was brought from paradise by Solomon's eagle; but most of the rabbis state that Solomon was informed of the worm's haunts by Asmodeus. The shamir had been entrusted by the prince of the sea to the mountain rooster alone, and the rooster had sworn to guard it well, but Solomon's men found the bird's nest, and covered it with glass. When the bird returned, it used the shamir to break the glass, whereupon the men scared the bird, causing it to <b>drop</b> the <b>worm,</b> which the men could then bring to Solomon.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills {{have their}} genesis {{with the father}} of William Henry Comstock (1830-1919) — Edwin Perkins Comstock (1799-1837) — who founded a drug company in New York City {{sometime}} before 1833. The Comstock patent medicine business {{was involved in the}} sale of a number of successful drugs, including Carlton's Pile Liniment, Oldridge's Balm of Columbia, Kline's Tooth Ache <b>Drops</b> and Judson's <b>Worm</b> Tea. Between 1833 and the time of the acquisition of the rights to Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills, the company remained {{under the control of the}} Comstocks through the additional involvement of Edwin's four brothers: ...|$|R
50|$|Elephant shrews mainly eat insects, spiders, centipedes, millipedes, and earthworms. An {{elephant}} shrew {{uses its}} nose to find prey and uses its tongue to flick small food into its mouth, {{much like an}} anteater. Eating large prey can pose a challenge; an elephant shrew struggling with an earthworm must first pin its prey {{to the ground with}} a forefoot. Then, turning its head to one side, it chews pieces off with its cheek teeth, much like a dog chewing a bone. This is a sloppy process, and many small pieces of <b>worm</b> <b>drop</b> to the ground; these are simply flicked up with the tongue. Some elephant shrews also feed on small amounts of plant matter, especially new leaves, seeds, and small fruits.|$|R
40|$|Skrjabinema {{method and}} water bath {{separating}} and numbering method {{was used to}} study the natural growth and decline rule of yak nematode simultaneously with adult insect and larvae on parasitic phase by yak post-mortem examination. The results indicated the general rule of yak nematode was {{that the number of}} larvae on parasitic phase gradually increased in August to December and reached to high time forth or later and with the peak in December to January next year. Along with the number of <b>worm</b> <b>dropped</b> in January to June, the number of adult insect in yak gradually rose and formed an obvious parasite high time in spring and mostly in April to May. Larvae on parasitic phase in yak dominated in cold season, and adult insect in warm season. Prevention of nematode in yak also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Attack {{polymorphism}} is {{a powerful}} tool for the attackers in the Internet to evade signature-based intrusion detection/prevention systems. In addition, new and faster Internet worms can be coded and launched easily by even high school students anytime against our critical infrastructures, such as DNS or update servers. We believe that polymorphic Internet worms will be developed in the future such that many of our current solutions might have a very small chance to survive. In this paper, we propose a simple solution called “Buttercup ” to counter against attacks based on buffer-overflow exploits (such as CodeRed, Nimda, Slammer, and Blaster). We have implemented our idea in SNORT, and included 19 return address ranges of buffer-overflow exploits. With a suite of tests against 55 TCPdump traces, the false positive rate for our best algorithm is as low as 0. 01 %. This indicates that, potentially, Buttercup can <b>drop</b> 100 % <b>worm</b> attack packets on the wire while only 0. 01 % of the good packets will be sacrificed...|$|R
60|$|A very {{different}} personage, but {{one who has}} rendered himself very conspicuous in our parish, {{is one of the}} old lady’s next-door neighbours. He is an old naval officer on half-pay, and his bluff and unceremonious behaviour disturbs the old lady’s domestic economy, not a little. In the first place, he will smoke cigars in the front court, and when he wants something to drink with them—which is by no means an uncommon circumstance—he lifts up the old lady’s knocker with his walking-stick, and demands to have a glass of table ale, handed over the rails. In addition to this cool proceeding, he {{is a bit of a}} Jack of all trades, or to use his own words, ‘a regular Robinson Crusoe;’ and nothing delights him better than to experimentalise on the old lady’s property. One morning he got up early, and planted three or four roots of full-grown marigolds in every bed of her front garden, to the inconceivable astonishment of the old lady, who actually thought when she got up and looked out of the window, that it was some strange eruption which had come out in the night. Another time he took to pieces the eight-day clock on the front landing, under pretence of cleaning the works, which he put together again, by some undiscovered process, in so wonderful a manner, that the large hand has done nothing but trip up the little one ever since. Then he took to breeding silk-worms, which he would bring in two or three times a day, in little paper boxes, to show the old lady, generally <b>dropping</b> a <b>worm</b> or two at every visit. The consequence was, that one morning a very stout silk-worm was discovered in the act of walking up-stairs—probably with the view of inquiring after his friends, for, on further inspection, it appeared that some of his companions had already found their way to every room in the house. The old lady went to the seaside in despair, and during her absence he completely effaced the name from her brass door-plate, in his attempts to polish it with aqua-fortis.|$|R
2500|$|Rabbi Johanan {{interpreted}} the words, [...] "After their kinds they went {{forth from the}} Ark," [...] in [...] to teach that the animals went out by their families, not alone. Rabbi Hana bar Bizna taught that Abraham's servant Eliezer once inquired of Noah's son Shem about these words in [...] asking Shem how his family managed. Shem replied {{that they had a}} difficult time in the Ark. During the day they fed the animals that usually fed by day, and during the night they fed those that normally fed by night. But Noah did not know what the chameleon ate. One day Noah was cutting a pomegranate, when a <b>worm</b> <b>dropped</b> out of it, and the chameleon ate it. From then on, Noah mashed up bran for the chameleon, and when the bran became wormy, the chameleon would eat. A fever struck the lion, so it lived off of its reserves rather than eating other animals. Noah discovered the avarshinah bird (some say the phoenix bird) lying in the hold of the Ark and asked it if it needed food. The bird told Noah that it saw that Noah was busy and decided not to give him any more trouble. Noah replied by asking that it be God's will that the bird not perish, as [...] says, [...] "Then I said: 'I shall die with my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the phoenix.'" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was evident}} {{that it would be}} useless to put on any other flies, for the two I had left were a good deal bedraggled, and not nearly so {{attractive}} as those I had used. Just before leaving the house that morning, Peter's son had given me a wooden match-box filled with worms for bait, which, although I did not expect to need, I put in my pocket. As a last resort I determined to try the trout with a worm. I selected the plumpest and most comely of the lot; I put a new hook on my line; I looped him about it in graceful coils, and cautiously approached the water, as before. Now a worm never attempts to wildly leap across a flowing brook, nor does he flit in thoughtless innocence through the sunny air, and over the bright transparent stream. If he happens to fall into the water, he sinks to the bottom; and if he be of a kind not subject to drowning, he generally endeavors to secrete himself under a stone, or to burrow in the soft mud. With this knowledge of his nature I gently <b>dropped</b> my <b>worm</b> upon the surface of the stream, and then allowed him slowly to sink. Out sailed the trout from under the bank, but stopped before reaching the sinking worm. There was a certain something in his action which seemed to indicate a disgust at the sight of such plebeian food, and a fear seized me that he might now swim off, and pay no further attention to my varied baits. Suddenly there was a ripple in the water, and I felt a pull on the line. Instantly I struck; {{and then there was a}} tug. My blood boiled through every vein and artery, and I sprang to my feet. I did not give him the butt; I did not let him run with yards of line down the brook; nor reel him in, and let him make another mad course up stream; I did not turn him over as he jumped into the air; nor endeavor, in any way, to show him that I understood those tricks, which his depraved nature prompted him to play upon the angler. With an absolute dependence upon the strength of old Peter's tackle, I lifted the fish. Out he came from the water, which held him with a gentle suction as if unwilling to let him go, and then he whirled through the air like a meteor flecked with rosy fire, and landed on the fresh green grass a dozen feet behind me. Down on my knees I dropped before him as he tossed and rolled, his beautiful spots and colors glistening in the sun. He was truly a splendid trout, fully a foot long, round and heavy. Carefully seizing him, I easily removed the hook from the bony roof of his capacious mouth thickly set with sparkling teeth, and then I tenderly killed him, with all his pluck, as old Peter would have said, still in him.|$|R
