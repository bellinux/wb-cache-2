Any increase in the energy efficiency of the <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> for commercial buildings would lead to significant energy savings and emissions reductions. In this work, we introduce an <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> engineering framework towards the optimal design of such <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> with improved <b>energy</b> efficiency and environmental performance. The framework features a superstructure representation of the various energy technology alternatives, a mixed-integer optimization formulation of the <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> design problem, and a multi-objective design optimization solution strategy, where economic and environmental criteria are simultaneously considered and properly traded off.
