25|$|By {{the time}} of Tacitus, the Aestii have emerged. The former Scythia is now entirely Sarmatia. Evidently the Sarmatians have conquered westward to the Vistula. The Goths have moved to the south. That the Balts lived east of the Vistula from remote prehistoric times is unquestioned. The Baltic languages, however, are only known from the 2nd {{millennium}} AD. They {{are known to have}} developed in tribal contexts, as they were originally tribal. The first mention of any tribes is in Ptolemy's description of European Sarmatia, where the main Prussian tribes are mentioned for the first time. In Tacitus, only the language of the Aestii is mentioned. Strabo distinguishes the Venedi, who were likely Slavs. From these few references, which are the only surviving evidence apart from <b>glottochronology</b> and place name analysis, {{it would seem that the}} Balts of Pytheas' time were well past the Common Balto-Slavic stage, and likely spoke a number of related dialects. By turning back at what he thought was the limit of Germany, he not only missed the Balts, but did not discover that more Germans, the Goths, had moved into the Baltic area.|$|E
2500|$|Studies of {{language}} change, especially <b>glottochronology</b> (that is, words changing in form or {{being replaced by}} borrowed synonyms), have given linguists the tools to estimate the point in time when many pairs {{of language}}s diverged from their common ancestral tongue. [...] The procedure depends {{on the assumption that}} languages change, in the absence of widespread literacy, at a constant rate.|$|E
2500|$|The Oto-Manguean {{family has}} existed in {{southern}} Mexico {{at least since}} 2000 BCE and probably several thousand years before, some estimates using the controversial method of <b>glottochronology</b> suggest an approximate splitting date of Proto-Otomanguean at c. 4400 BCE. [...] This makes the Oto-Manguean family the language family of the Americas with the deepest time depth, {{as well as the}} oldest language family with evidence of tonal contrast in the proto-language.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the twentieth}} century an {{alternative}} method, lexicostatistics, was developed, which is mainly associated with Morris Swadesh but is based on earlier work. [...] This uses a short word list of basic vocabulary in the various languages for comparisons. [...] Swadesh used 100 (earlier 200) items that {{are assumed to be}} cognate (on the basis of phonetic similarity) in the languages being compared, though other lists have also been used. Distance measures are derived by examination of language pairs but such methods reduce the information. An outgrowth of lexicostatistics is <b>glottochronology,</b> initially developed in the 1950s, which proposed a mathematical formula for establishing the date when two languages separated, based on percentage of a core vocabulary of culturally independent words. In its simplest form a constant rate of change is assumed, though later versions allow variance but still fail to achieve reliability. <b>Glottochronology</b> has met with mounting scepticism, and is seldom applied today. Dating estimates can now be generated by computerised methods that have fewer restrictions, calculating rates from the data. However, no mathematical means of producing proto-language split-times on the basis of lexical retention has been proven reliable.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{most other}} Indians in the American {{southeast}} {{at the start}} of the historic era, the Cherokee spoke an Iroquoian language. Since the Great Lakes region was the core of Iroquoian language speakers, scholars have theorized that the Cherokee migrated south from that region. However, some argue that the Iroquois migrated north from the southeast, with the Tuscarora breaking off from that group during the migration. [...] Linguistic analysis shows a relatively large difference between Cherokee and the northern Iroquoian languages, suggesting a split in the distant past. <b>Glottochronology</b> studies suggest the split occurred between about 1,500 and 1,800 B.C. The ancient settlement of Kituwa on the Tuckasegee River, formerly next to and now part of Qualla Boundary (the reservation of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians), is often cited as the original Cherokee settlement in the Southeast.|$|E

50|$|The best-known {{supporter}} of monogenesis in America in the mid-20th century was Morris Swadesh (cf. Ruhlen 1994:215). He pioneered two important methods for investigating deep relationships between languages, lexicostatistics and <b>glottochronology.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, {{scholarly}} {{interest in}} {{the question of the}} origin of language has only gradually been rekindled from the 1950s on (and then controversially) with ideas such as universal grammar, mass comparison and <b>glottochronology.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In simple <b>glottochronology,</b> the (debatable) {{assumption}} of a constant decay rate in languages {{allows one to}} estimate the age of single languages. (To compute the time of split between two languages requires additional assumptions, independent of exponential decay).|$|E
5000|$|He was {{the chief}} pioneer of lexicostatistics, which {{attempts}} to classify languages {{on the basis of}} the extent to which they have replaced basic words reconstructible in the proto-language, and <b>glottochronology,</b> which extends lexicostatistics by computing divergence dates from the lexical retention rate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{language}} change is old, {{and its history}} is reviewed in Hymes (1973) and Wells (1973). <b>Glottochronology</b> itself {{dates back to the}} mid-20th century. [...] An introduction to the subject is given in Embleton (1986) and in McMahon and McMahon (2005).|$|E
50|$|The {{controversial}} {{technique of}} <b>glottochronology</b> {{suggests that the}} Pai branch of Yuman may have separated from the other two branches of Core Yuman (River Yuman and Delta-California Yuman) about 1,000-1,700 years ago. Paipai may have separated from Upland Yuman 1,000 years ago or less.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, Sergei Starostin, using strict {{linguistic}} methods (proposing regular phonological correspondences, reconstructions, <b>glottochronology,</b> etc.), {{became the}} first to put {{the idea that the}} Caucasian, Yeniseian and Sino-Tibetan languages are related on firmer ground. In 1991, Sergei L. Nikolayev added the Na-Dené languages to Starostin's classification.|$|E
50|$|Sankoff {{published}} his first paper in 1963 {{while he was}} an undergraduate student in Mathematics at McGill University. Starting with his doctoral research, he developed mathematical formulations {{to a number of}} pivotal concepts in socio- and historical linguistics, including <b>glottochronology,</b> variable rules analysis, the linguistic marketplace and code switching.|$|E
50|$|The Jesuit texts {{establish}} {{that the language}} {{was related to the}} Yuman languages of the Colorado River region. It is thought to be the most divergent language of the family, which is generally called Yuman-Cochimí to reflect this. Based on <b>glottochronology</b> studies, the separation between Cochimi and the Yuman languages is believed to have occurred about 1000 BC.|$|E

50|$|Swadesh {{became a}} {{consultant}} with the International Auxiliary Language Association, which standardized Interlingua and {{presented it to}} the public in 1951 (Esterhill 2000). In this role, he originated the lists of 100 and 200 basic vocabulary items, used (with some variation) in both lexicostatistics and <b>glottochronology</b> for comparison among languages. They have since been known as the Swadesh lists.|$|E
50|$|Ramer has {{published}} extensively on syntactic typology (esp. {{in relation to}} Australian, Eskimo, and Austronesian languages); on phonological theory {{and its relation to}} phenomena such as versification and speech errors; on comparative linguistics and etymology (Indo-European, Uto-Aztecan, Yiddish), on <b>glottochronology</b> and genetic classification of languages (Nostratic, Altaic, Haida-Nadene, Pakawan/Coahuiltecan, Tonkawa-Nadene); on poetics (Vedic, Homeric, medieval Yiddish); and on the history of linguistics.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Glottochronology,</b> which {{attempts}} {{to estimate the}} time depth of a language family based on an assumed rate of change in languages. Related to this is lexicostatistics, which {{attempts to}} determine the degree of relation between a set of languages by comparing the percentage of basic vocabulary (words like [...] "I", [...] "you", [...] "heart", [...] "stone", [...] "two", [...] "be", [...] "and") they share in common.|$|E
5000|$|In origin, {{the words}} in the Swadesh lists were chosen for their universal, {{culturally}} independent availability in as many languages as possible, regardless of their [...] "stability". Nevertheless, the stability of the resulting list of [...] "universal" [...] vocabulary under language change and the potential use of this fact for purposes of <b>glottochronology</b> have been analyzed by numerous authors, including Marisa Lohr 1999, 2000.|$|E
50|$|Linguistic prehistorians {{are not in}} {{agreement}} {{as to whether the}} Kiliwa's linguistic ancestors are most likely to have migrated into the Baja California peninsula from the north separately from the ancestors of the Cochimí and the Core Yumans, or whether they became differentiated from those groups in place. The controversial technique of <b>glottochronology</b> suggests that the separation of Kiliwa from Core Yuman may have occurred about 2,000-3,000 years ago.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Glottochronology</b> {{was found}} {{to work in the}} case of Indo-European, {{accounting}} for 87% of the variance. It is also postulated to work for Hamito-Semitic (Fleming 1973), Chinese (Munro 1978) and Amerind (Stark 1973; Baumhoff and Olmsted 1963). For the latter, correlations have been obtained with radiocarbon dating and blood groups as well as archaeology.Note that the approach of Gray and Atkinson, as they say, {{has nothing to do with}} [...] "glottochronology".|$|E

Note that in the referenced Gray and Atkinson paper, they hold that their methods can not be called [...] "glottochronology", by confining this term to its original method.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Glottochronology</b> {{has been}} {{controversial}} ever since, partly owing {{to issues of}} accuracy, {{as well as the}} question of whether its basis is sound (see e.g. Bergsland 1958; Bergsland and Vogt 1962; Fodor 1961; Chretien 1962; Guy 1980). These concerns have been addressed by Dobson et al. (1972), Dyen (1973) and Kruskal, Dyen and Black (1973). The assumption of a single-word replacement rate can distort the divergence-time estimate when borrowed words are included (Thomason and Kaufman 1988). Chrétien purported to disprove the mathematics of the Swadesh-model. At a conference at Yale in 1971 his criticisms were shown to be invalid. See the published proceedings under Dyen (1973) The same conference saw the application of the theory to Creole language (Wittmann 1973).An overview of recent arguments can be obtained from the papers of a conference held at the McDonald Institute in 2000. These presentations vary from [...] "Why linguists don't do dates" [...] to the one by Starostin discussed above.Since its original inception, <b>glottochronology</b> has been rejected by many linguists, mostly Indo-Europeanists of the school of the traditional comparative method. Criticisms have been answered in particular around three points of discussion.|$|E
