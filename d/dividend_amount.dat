Large shareholders are disaggregated into three types institutions, governments, and large individual shareholders to determine if they influence the dividend paid. The results suggest that government is the only large shareholder that plays a significant monitoring role on dividend decisions. Furthermore, the results show that government ownership and firm profitability increase the probability of paying dividends, while the leverage ratio decreases the probability. Overall, the findings indicate that companies listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange pay dividends to reduce agency conflict and avoid exploiting minority shareholders...|$|R

50|$|The {{board of}} directors, elected representatives of shareholders/stockholders, {{is a group}} of {{individuals}} that announce and declare a dividend. The day that the dividend is announced on is called the declaration date. This day is very important to investors who are looking to invest in a stock that yields dividends. In regards to dividends, the date of record is the day that a stockholder needs to be registered by in order to receive the dividend. If a stockholder registers on or before the date of record then the investor is classified as a holder of record. A company's payment date is the day the Company disperses its dividends to all of the holders of record invested into that said company. Payment dates differ between companies; however dividends are usually distributed 3 weeks after the date of record. Each company provides different <b>dividends</b> <b>amounts</b> to their shareholders. The dividend yield of a company is the percentage paid to the investor. In technical terms it is defined as the dollar <b>amount</b> of the <b>dividend</b> over the (divided by) common share price of the stock. Dividends are a way to make money in the stock market even if the stock one purchase is not going up. It is a good thing for investors to know which companies have good dividends and/or which companies can afford to maintain their current dividends. That is where the dividend payout ratio comes into play. This ratio is an indicator for investors about the companies that they might potentially invest in. This ratio can be broken down to a very simple formula which is: dividend per share divided by a company's common earning per share. This dividend payout ratio is a great indicator on whether or not a company can continue to pay its investors the dividends.|$|R
