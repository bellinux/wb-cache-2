40|$|Mainstream Christianity embraces an anthropological dualism {{between the}} spiritual and the physical, {{strongly}} favouring the spiritual {{at the expense of}} the physical: “For we know that the Law is spiritual; but I am fleshly, sold under sin’s control; (…) So then, with my mind I serve God’s Law, but with my human nature I serve the principle of sin. ” (Rom. 7, 14 - 23) Thus, Christians are required to repress their physical nature and cultivate their spiritual nature exclusively. Traditionally, education tends to disregard concern for the physical. Yet around the turn to the twentieth century, the physical side of human underwent a re-appraisal that was epitomized by Friedrich Nietzsche’s Thus spake Zarathustra. Most leaders of the New Education Movement were Christians, yet favored physical education as well as religious education. They viewed the relationship between the physical and the spiritual as complementary rather than antagonistic. This concept was also embodied in <b>Jena</b> <b>Plan</b> proposed by Peter Petersen. Petersen’s <b>Jena</b> <b>Plan,</b> an educational blueprint that came to be implemented under a succession of widely differing political regions: the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, the Soviet-occupied zone, and the Federal Republic of Germany. The reason for the Jena Plan’s adaptability to these regimes, as well as its eventual quick demise, lies in Petersen’s approach to the mind-body problem, which was crucially shaped by vitalism, a doctrine that was popular around the turn to the twentieth century...|$|E
