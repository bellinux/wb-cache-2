25|$|The term “thangata” has {{had several}} {{meanings}} in Malawi {{in the last}} 120 years, and its traditional or pre-colonial use {{was very different from}} its uses in colonial and modern times. The word exists in the Chewa and the related Mang'anja languages, and its first pre-colonial meaning was “help” or “to assist”, in the sense of freely-given reciprocal help such as neighbours might give each other building huts or clearing fields. It also had the meaning of the agricultural work that a member of the village community did for his chief. The ownership of land in much of Malawi was vested in the community, not individuals. Traditional leaders acted as trustees over communal land, and granted the right to use it to individuals in their communities. By custom, these leaders received in <b>gifts</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> or labour from those in their community who had benefitted. This was also called thangata. When communal land was plentiful, community leaders could not demand thangata, but once it became scarcer in the colonial period, and particularly after the introduction of Indirect rule on 1933, the chiefs could impose a condition of thangata work on any grant. In {{the last two or three}} decades, chiefs have begun to require cash sums or rents to allow the use of communal land, but these cash payments are not called thangata.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gifts</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> also {{referred}} to as in-kind donations, is a kind of charitable giving in which, instead of giving money to buy needed goods and services, the goods and services themselves are given. <b>Gifts</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> are distinguished from gifts of cash or stock. Some types of <b>gifts</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> are appropriate, others are not. Examples of in-kind gifts include goods like food, clothing, medicines, furniture, office equipment, and building materials. Performance of services, such as building an orphanage, providing office space or offering administrative support, may also be counted as in-kind gifts.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the argument that <b>gifts</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> often {{do not meet the}} needs of recipients, it has also been argued that <b>gifts</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> fail to empower the recipients because the recipients don't have as much flexibility on how to spend the gifts as they would with gifts of cash or of public goods that they actively solicit. Relatedly, {{it has been argued that}} sending <b>gifts</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> without checking on what the recipients may actually need may be disrespectful to the recipients, and in some cases self-centered and narcissistic, being focused on the needs of the donor rather than the recipient.|$|E

40|$|Evans-Pritchard {{probably}} {{knew he was}} exaggerating, but {{not being able to}} resist the chance to repay a <b>gift</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> he reversed Maitland 2 ̆ 7 s dictum and claimed that history must choose between being social anthropology or being nothing. If we substitute 2 ̆ 2 tedious 2 ̆ 2 for 2 ̆ 2 nothing 2 ̆ 2 we would have a truer statement. Legal history, if not quite heeding Evans-Pritchard, has in the past decade begun to learn some lessons from legal anthropology and the sociology of law. Studies of bureaucratic development, forms of action, formulae and writs, while still flourishing in the hands of several brilliant practitioners, are tending to give way slowly, but steadily, to the study of a broad spectrum of disputes and dispute processing. Under the influence of legal and social anthropology legal history has moved toward social history and away from administrative history. If anthropology had one thing to teach legal historians it was by example of showing that the category of the interesting did not always involve a king, his judges and courts, and the lawyers who hovered about them. Alternative modes of dispute processing-negotiation, mediation, arbitration, feud-just as much as THE LAW can {{be a part of the}} array of options a society might offer disputants. (For students of the early and central middle ages, legal history would be a pretty thin subject indeed without these so-called alternative modes.) Legal historians have also learned from legal anthropologists that a lawsuit needs a social context if it is to make much sense. It took anthropology to remind us what we must have already known: that cases have histories and that litigants have them, too; that the form a claim takes when it is presented to a court may have little to do with the real matter in dispute; that a lawsuit might be no more than a tactic in a wider dispute and the litigants may be surrogates for the real parties in interest; and that neither a dispute, nor a lawsuit, need lead to ajudgment of a court...|$|R
40|$|African {{governments are}} {{increasingly}} interested in understanding factors affecting {{the marketing of}} staple food grains by rural households which produce partially for home consumption. Food security depends not only on aggregate production, but also the distribution of production by income group, social class and geographical area. The availability of food to nonagricultural producers and those who produce insufficient amounts to satisfy their subsistence requirements {{is influenced by the}} interaction of variables affecting the allocation of production between sales and other disposals, consumption, and storage. Grain which is added to disposals limits household consumption as well as security provided by on-farm stocks. At the same time, if sold, it adds to income, affecting both consumption and security. Marketed surplus, <b>in</b> conjunction with <b>gifts</b> and <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> exchanges, comprises the disposable or marketable surplus component of output. Understanding the behavior of marketed surplus and the variables affecting it can be of major importance in the development of sound policies with respect to agricultural marketing and prices, imports and exports, national reserves and overall rural and national development objectives. At the present time, many African governments are involved in or contemplating involvement in the marketing of staple food products. International organizations and agencies are investing increasing amounts of money in food security and agricultural development assistance schemes, arguing for the urgency of meeting "basic needs". An understanding of the determinants of marketed surplus is an essential element of effective planning and program design. This paper is an outgrowth of an attempt to estimate simple supply and demand functions for staple food grains in a West African county. Marketing,...|$|R
