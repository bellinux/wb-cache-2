Adhesion to thermoplastic olefin (TPO) substrates, like blends of polypropylene (PP), is often difficult to attain due to the low surface energy and the nonpolar nature of the surface. One always specifies, therefore, that the surface of the substrate must be pretreated. Pretreatment methods can vary, from oxidation of the surface, e. g., plasma or flame, to diffusion and mechanical interlocking of an applied polymer to the surface. Mechanical interlocking to the nonpolar TPO surface can be achieved through the use of an adhesion promoter, namely a chlorinated polyolefin (CPO). The type of CPO used, in addition to the types of solvents and flame treatments used, can substantially influence the degree of adhesion/cohesion obtained within the CPO/TPO system. PP is a TPO that is used in automobile construction. In this report it is described a set of experiments that provide quantitative information about how CPOs optimize the adhesion of a commercial primer coating to PP. The study was performed according to eight CPOs and two different ways of flame treatment. The CPOs were prepared by mixing them with a standard primer in order to investigate what type of CPO optimized better the adhesion of the primer to a PP substrate. On the other hand, the experiments were started with non ideal parameters for the flame treatment and were changed for the final experiment to work at its best. To study the paint adhesion a steam jet test was used. This consists of an assay based in <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>cleaners.</b> A hot water jet impacts into the paint system during a specific time and tests the paint adhesion to the substrate...|$|R

40|$|Exploitation of ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil {{reservoirs}} {{is always}} associated with numerous risks, challenges, and obstacles. One {{of the most}} pronounced constraints in development of such fields {{is the number of}} wells, which is imposed by massively high cost of drilling. Low number of wells may lead to <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> isolation regions left after primary production (pressure depletion) of the reservoir. Ultradeep reservoirs with <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> are more prone to such leftover <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> isolation regions due to their low permeable characteristic. These <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> isolation regions can, subsequently, deteriorate the efficiency of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) as the injected fluid cannot access the residual oil in these regions. Therefore, well placement and inter-well spacing optimizations is of greater importance in ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoirs to ensure higher ultimate oil recovery at lower costs. Furthermore, due to high cost of development of ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoirs, the EOR strategy and commencement time for the selected EOR strategy are very critical. The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate how optimization of well placement, well spacing, and startup time for miscible CO 2 flooding can enhance the incremental and ultimate oil recoveries in an ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoir. To do this, a synthetic grid model was made to run different simulation scenarios on it. The model was initialized with rock and fluid properties within the range of those in the ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> Wilcox formation in the Gulf of Mexico to ensure that it mimics an ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoir. The obtained results showed that optimization of well placement, well spacing, and commencement time for any EOR strategy such as miscible CO 2 flooding is very critical in the course of making a Field Development Plan (FDP) for an ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoir. The results, discussions, and conclusions were finally used by the author to shed light on potential further work on each of the aforementioned challenges in ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoirs such as Wilcox formation in the Gulf of Mexico. </p...|$|R
