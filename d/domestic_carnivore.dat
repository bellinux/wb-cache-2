40|$|Rabies is endemic in {{wildlife}} or <b>domestic</b> <b>carnivore</b> populations globally. Infection {{of domestic}} dogs {{is of particular}} concern in many areas. In regions where domestic animals {{are at risk of}} exposure to rabies virus, dogs should be routinely vaccinated against rabies to protect both pet and human populations. Many countries require demonstration of an adequate level of serum rabies neutralizing antibodies to permit entry of dogs during international travel. We analysed rabies titres of dogs seeking travel certification in Israel to assess demographic and vaccine history factors associated with antibody titres below the acceptable threshold for travel certification. Having received only one previous rabies vaccination and a longer duration since the most recent vaccination was received were primary risk factors for not achieving an adequate rabies virus neutralizing antibody titre for travel certification. These risk factors had stronger effects in younger animals, but were consistent for dogs of all ages. In particular, these findings reiterate the importance of administering at least two rabies vaccinations (the primo vaccination and subsequent booster) to ensure population-level protection against rabies in dogs globally...|$|E
40|$|Rodents {{are shared}} {{intermediate}} or paratenic hosts for Echinococcus multilocularis, Toxocara spp. and Toxoplasma gondii, and {{may serve as}} valuable indicators for assessing the occurrence {{and the level of}} environmental contamination and infection pressure with free-living stages of these zoonotic parasites. We investigated 658 non-commensal rodents for parasite infections in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland. The prevalence of infection with E. multilocularis was highest in Arvicola terrestris captured in the north-western area (16 · 5 %, CI: 10 · 1 %- 24 · 8 %), possibly reflecting a higher red fox density due to the low incidence of sarcoptic mange {{in this part of the}} canton. The exposure rate to Toxocara spp. was highest in the urban area (13 · 2 %, CI: 7 · 9 %- 20 · 3 %), and may account for higher densities of <b>domestic</b> <b>carnivore</b> and red fox definitive hosts within the city. Exposure to T. gondii was widespread (5 · 0 %, CI: 3 · 2 - 7 · 4 %), indicating a ubiquitous distribution of infected cat definitive hosts. Interestingly, a widespread distribution of Taenia taeniaeformis, a parasite mainly transmitted by cats, was similarly evidenced in A. terrestris. Distinct spatial patterns for the different zoonotic parasites likely reflected differences in distribution, abundance, and habitat use of the respective definitive hosts. These results highlight the potential value of rodents as shared indicators for these pathogen...|$|E
40|$|Giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) are {{specialized}} insectivores {{and consume}} mainly ants and termites in the wild. In captivity, giant anteaters are either fed a complete diet, {{or a combination}} of a <b>domestic</b> <b>carnivore</b> diet with leaf eater pellets, or a traditional gruel-type diet. Soft faeces are a frequently encountered problem with this type of feeding. In the present study, we analysed diet and faeces composition, calculated digestibility and measured mean retention time on various diets in eight giant anteaters (total of n = 64 experiments). The results suggest that the digestive physiology of giant anteaters {{is similar to that of}} domestic dogs and cats in terms of nutrient digestibility and digesta retention. When testing correlations between faecal dry matter content and other variables, no relationship with dietary crude fibre content or mean digesta retention time could be detected. However, acid insoluble ash intake was significantly and positively correlated with faecal dry matter content. The amount of acid insoluble ash excreted with the faeces was higher than that ingested with the diet offered, indicating that the giant anteaters ingested soil from their enclosure of up to 93 g per day. This finding is consistent with observation of faeces of wild giant anteaters that contain soil or sand most likely due to indiscriminate feeding. It also corresponds to reports that indigestible materials such as peat, soil, chitin or cellulose contribute to a firmer faecal consistency in various carnivore species. Therefore, offering giant anteaters the opportunity to voluntarily ingest soil from their enclosure might be beneficial...|$|E

40|$|Predation is {{increasingly}} pointed out {{as one of}} the factors contributing to population declines of ground-nesting farmland birds, though it remains poorly understood how ongoing transformations of agricultural landscapes affect predator assemblages. This study addressed this issue, estimating the contribution of landscape composition and conﬁguration to spatial variation in species richness and abundances of mammalian carnivores across a gradient of agricultural intensiﬁcation in southern Portugal. The carnivore assemblage was diverse (10 species), but it was largely dominated by just three widespread and abundant species of generalist predators: domestic dog (Canis familiaris), red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon). The number of <b>domestic</b> <b>carnivore</b> species and the abundance of cats (Felis catus) increased along with farmland occupation by human dwellings, whereas dogs were not responsive to landscape variables. The species richness of wild carnivores was highest in landscapes with a patchwork of arable ﬁelds and semi-natural habitats such as forests and shrubland, though it was also high in irrigated landscapes with dense networks of irrigation channels and tree lines bordering agricultural ﬁelds. Irrigation was also positively associated with the abundance of otters (Lutra lutra) and mongooses. Cats, foxes, badgers (Meles meles), and total and wild carnivore abundances, were positively affected by increasing cover by eucalyptus and pine forest plantations. In general, results suggest that the highest diversity and abundance of carnivores in Mediterranean farmland may occur in mosaic landscapes with small agricultural ﬁelds, high cover by woody vegetation patches and corridors, and many human dwellings. Preventing scrub encroachment and afforestation may thus be necessary to maintain a low predation risk in open farmland habitats, which are often inhabited by ground-nesting birds of high conservation concern. Conversely, keeping shrubland and forest patches within farmed landscapes may be essential where carnivore persistence is a relevant conservation goal...|$|E

40|$|The cytological {{examination}} of mammary tumors at <b>domestic</b> <b>carnivores</b> is considered useful by some researchers (with a precision of 90 - 100 % from {{the establishment of}} malignity), while others consider that by aspiration with fine needle we cannot differentiate with certitude a benign tumor by a malign one (1, 2).

40|$|We identifi ed 2 {{cases of}} European bat {{lyssavirus}} subtype 1 transmission to <b>domestic</b> <b>carnivores</b> (cats) in France. Bat-to-cat transmission is suspected. Low amounts of virus antigen in cat brain made diagnosis diffi cult. Most countries in western Europe are currently free of rabies in terrestrial mammals, {{as was the}} case in France during 2001 – 2008 (1). However, rabies still remains a public health problem in these countries because of natural circulation of bat-specific viruses (order Mononegavirales, family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus) such as European bat lyssaviruses (EBLVs). These viruses are divided into genotypes 5 (EBLV- 1) and 6 (EBLV- 2); the first genotype is subdivided into subtypes a and b (2). Knowledge of the prevalence and epidemiology of EBLV is limited (2 – 5). To date, natural transmission of EBLV- 1 has been reported in a limited number of terrestrial mammals, including 5 sheep in Denmark (6) and 1 stone marten in Germany (7) (Table 1). Since 1985, only 3 human deaths from EBLVs have been confirmed (3) (Table 1).

This study aimed to observe and describe the branching morphology of the main arterial branches of thoracic and abdominal aorta in the coati, by comparing the findings with existing literature on the other domestic and wild species. For this study, two adult male specimens were used, collected from highways {{in the state of}} Minas Gerais, Brazil, victims of roadkill. The specimens were fixed in formalin solution and their aortic branches were filled with latex for subsequent dissection and analysis. It was observed that the left subclavian artery is a direct branch of the aortic arch, there is no formation of a bicarotid or celiac-mesenteric trunk, facts similarly described in <b>domestic</b> <b>carnivores.</b> Thus, it was noticed that the arterial branches of aorta in the coati, both in the thoracic and abdominal cavities, show a distribution very similar to that observed in <b>domestic</b> <b>carnivores,</b> something which reflects their evolutionary closeness within the Carnivora order.

From spring 1993 to spring 1998, the prevalence of E. multilocularis in rodents was 9 % to 39 % for Arvicola terrestris and 10 % to 21 % for Microtus arvalis. From June 1996 to October 1997, 6 (7 %) of 86 feral dogs and 1 of 33 cats living close to the region tested positive for intestinal E. multilocularis infection. Testing included egg detection by coproscopy, antigen detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and specific parasite DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction. Thus, the presence of infected <b>domestic</b> <b>carnivores</b> can increase E. multilocularis exposure risk in humans. A seroepidemiologic survey of 2, 943 blood donors in the area used specific Em 2 -ELISA.

The database consisted of 1415 pathogens causing disease in humans, 616 in livestock and 374 in <b>domestic</b> <b>carnivores.</b> Multihost pathogens were very prevalent among human pathogens (61. 6 %) {{and even more so}} among domestic mammal pathogens (livestock 77. 3 %, carnivores 90. 0 %).

The ability of a pathogen to infect multiple hosts, particularly hosts in other taxonomic orders or wildlife, were also risk factors for emergence in human and livestock pathogens.

In this context, a survey was conducted on dioctophymosis cases diagnosed at the Veterinary Pathology Laboratory (LPV) and Veterinary Clinical Hospital (HCV) of the Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel), and at a specialist veterinary imaging diagnostics clinic. In total, 95 cases were registered. The high series of the disease in dogs can be related to the presence {{of a large number of}} stray and semi-domestic dogs in the city, and also due to the ingestion of intermediate hosts of D. renale parasitized with the infective larvae.

Routine examinations have also confirmed autochthonous infections with D. repens in Gauteng and North West provinces. Acanthocheilonema reconditum was the species with the highest overall prevalence of 8. 85 % (122 / 1 379). The highest prevalence rate was recorded in Mpumalanga with 29. 13 % (97 / 333) followed by Maputo province with 6. 39 % (20 / 313) and KwaZulu-Natal with 1. 2 % (5 / 417).
