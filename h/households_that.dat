House Resolution 5620 also included disaster {{aid to the}} state of Louisiana. In early December, the Small Business Administration (SBA) approved $33.2million worth of low-interest loans for repairs to homes and businesses. By then, FEMA had received about 43,600 applications for aid, while approving $35.9million in grants to over 18,000 <b>households</b> <b>that</b> were ineligible for loans from the SBA or were uninsured. In addition to the mobile homes already provided, FEMA spent $22.6 million on disaster housing.|$|E
5|$|Shortwave {{listening}}, or SWLing, is {{the hobby}} {{of listening to}} shortwave radio broadcasts located on frequencies between 1700 kHz and 30 MHz. Listeners range from casual users seeking international news and entertainment programming, to hobbyists immersed in {{the technical aspects of}} radio reception and collecting official confirmations (QSL cards) that document their reception of distant broadcasts (DXing). In some developing countries, shortwave listening enables remote communities to obtain regional programming traditionally provided by local medium wave AM broadcasters. In 2002, the number of <b>households</b> <b>that</b> were capable of shortwave listening was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.|$|E

The number of <b>households</b> <b>that</b> had Comedy Central jumped from 9.1 million in 1997 to 50 million in June 1998. When the show debuted, the most Comedy Central had earned for a 30-second commercial was US$7,500. Within a year, advertisers were paying an average of US$40,000 for 30 seconds of advertising time during airings of South Park in its second season, while some paid as much as US$80,000.|$|E

5|$|At {{that time}} the {{shutdown}} began, all state government spending and operations {{not considered to be}} critical stopped. Suspended state services included driving tests, childcare assistance, senior and disability linkage lines, criminal background checks, and road construction. State government offices, state parks, highway rest areas, and sites run by the Minnesota Historical Society, among others, closed. The commissioner of the Department of Human Services, Lucinda Jesson, said that letters had to be sent to over 580,000 <b>households</b> <b>that</b> relied on the department for social services to notify them about the possible shutdown. More critical parts of the state government, including public safety, health care, benefit payments, and care for residents of state facilities continued. Services that were continued during the shutdown could have amounted to as much as 80 percent of state spending.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{different}} dimensions of small-scale farmers in KwaZulu-Natal, a principal component analysis was conducted on data obtained from a sample survey of 160 households. The following socio-economic components were extracted: Component 1 is an emerging commercial and mechanised household (i. e. it uses machinery), while Component 2 is a landless farm <b>household</b> <b>that</b> is more educated and earns more non-farm income, largely from contractor services. Component 3 is a non-farm female-headed <b>household</b> <b>that</b> depends on income from land renting and a non-farm job. This is a resource-poor household. Component 4 is a small intensive garden farmer household headed by a more educated female with better access to institutional services. Component 5 is a less educated, female-headed and land-poor <b>household</b> <b>that</b> rents in more land and is an intensive producer. Component 6 is a land-less <b>household</b> <b>that</b> rents in land and is also involved in contractor services. The implication is that policies aimed at assisting small-scale farmers should {{take into account the}} different dimensions of farmers, as economic policies may influence different households differently. ...|$|R

25|$|In this role, due {{to their}} working heritage, Border Collies are very {{demanding}}, playful, and energetic. They thrive best in <b>households</b> <b>that</b> can provide them with plenty of play and exercise, either with humans or other dogs. Due to their demanding personalities and need for mental stimulation and exercise, many Border Collies develop problematic behaviours in <b>households</b> <b>that</b> {{are not able to}} provide for their needs. They are infamous for chewing holes in walls, furniture such as chairs and table legs, destructive scraping and hole digging, due to boredom. Border Collies may exhibit a strong desire to herd, a trait they may show with small children, cats, and other dogs. The breed's herding trait has been deliberately encouraged, {{as it was in the}} dogs from which the Border Collie was developed, by selective breeding for many generations. However, being eminently trainable, they can live amicably with other pets if given proper socialisation training.|$|E

The second group, composed of most of the females, could grew up in <b>households</b> <b>that</b> predominantly cultivated plots on loess, possibly beyond the landmarks of the Unstrut River or about 80m above the site on the Querfurt plateau 1–2km away. Sex-specific tendencies, the combination of the Sr isotope data with the results of previous carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses, and the similarity of the Sr isotope data of the youngest child with the majority of the males may be evaluated as being in agreement with the predominance of patrilocal residential rules.|$|E

30|$|An Agricultural {{household}} is 5.7 {{percentage points}} {{more likely to}} be food secure than a type of <b>household</b> <b>that</b> is not considered under this definition.

Moreover, an agricultural household is 2.7 percentage points less likely to suffer severe food insecurity. This result makes intuitive sense, since a <b>household</b> <b>that</b> receives income from agricultural activities {{may be more likely to}} also produce food for own consumption.|$|R
