Only 4 -hydroxy- 7, 8 -dihydro-β-ionone and dihydrodehydro-β-ionone have been described previously in the literature.

40|$|Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) is a {{contaminant}} {{of grain}} and fruit and {{has one of}} the highest levels of carcinogenicity of any natural toxin. AFB 1 and the fungi that produce it can also contaminate the raw materials used for beer and wine manufacture, such as corn and grapes.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the conversion efficiency of proso millet to ethanol compared to corn in a bench-scale dry-grind procedure. Seven proso millet cultivars and six advanced breeding lines containing waxy starch were fermented with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and ethanol production was compared with normal corn and “highly fermentable” corn. The highly fermentable corn exhibited the <b>highest</b> <b>fermentation</b> efficiency (97. 0 ± 1. 4 %). Among proso millet lines, those with the <b>highest</b> <b>fermentation</b> efficiencies were: Huntsman (85. 9 ± 0. 6 %), 172 - 2 - 9 (90. 8 ± 0. 2 %), 172 - 2 - 13 (85. 1 ± 2. 5 %), and 182 - 4 - 24 (84. 7 ± 2. 1). Waxy proso millet lines resulted in <b>higher</b> <b>fermentation</b> efficiencies than the non-waxy proso millet varieties containing normal starch (82. 4 ± 5. 5 % vs. 75. 5 ± 7. 4 %, respectively, p = 0. 01). Proso millet distiller’s dried grains with solubles (DDGS) contained more protein (26. 6 – 33. 4 %) than the DDGS from corn (17. 2 – 23. 4 %).

40|$|Lager beer is {{the most}} {{consumed}} alcoholic beverage in the world. Its production process {{is marked by a}} fermentation conducted at low (8 to 15 °C) temperatures and by the use of Saccharomyces pastorianus, an interspecific hybrid between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the cold-tolerant Saccharomyces eubayanus. Recent whole-genome-sequencing efforts revealed that the currently available lager yeasts belong to one of only two archetypes, “Saaz” and “Frohberg. ” This limited genetic variation likely reflects that all lager yeasts descend from only two separate interspecific hybridization events, which may also explain the relatively limited aromatic diversity between the available lager beer yeasts compared to, for example, wine and ale beer yeasts. In this study, 31 novel interspecific yeast hybrids were developed, resulting from large-scale robot-assisted selection and breeding between carefully selected strains of S. cerevisiae (six strains) and S. eubayanus (two strains). Interestingly, many of the resulting hybrids showed a broader temperature tolerance than their parental strains and reference S. pastorianus yeasts. Moreover, they combined a <b>high</b> <b>fermentation</b> capacity with a desirable aroma profile in laboratory-scale lager <b>beer</b> <b>fermentations,</b> thereby successfully enriching the currently available lager yeast biodiversity.

40|$|In a {{bioethanol}} {{production plant}} the separation unit performs {{the recovery of}} the ethanol from the raw <b>fermentation</b> <b>beer</b> to produce <b>high</b> purity ethanol. Although different separation techniques are available, distillation or distillation combined with other unit operations, remains the main technology considered for the ethanol purification. The formation of a homogeneous minimum-boiling azeotrope limits the purity allowable employing a simple distillation unit. The classical configuration for the separation of an ethanol-water mixture by extractive distillation employs three columns: the pre-concentrator, the extractive column and a stripping section. Starting from this configuration, new separation sequences are obtained applying the thermal coupling principle. Then, the column sections were rearranged taking into account the limits imposed by the recycle streams.

40|$|Background: Addition {{of sugar}} syrups {{to the basic}} wort is a popular {{technique}} to achieve <b>higher</b> gravity in <b>beer</b> <b>fermentations,</b> but it results in dilution of the free amino nitrogen (FAN) content in the medium. The multicomponent protease enzyme Flavourzyme has beneficial effect on the brewer's yeast <b>fermentation</b> performance during <b>high</b> gravity <b>fermentations</b> as it increases the initial FAN value and results in higher FAN uptake, higher specific growth rate, higher ethanol yield and improved flavour profile. Results: In the present study, transcriptome and metabolome analysis were used to elucidate {{the effect on the}} addition of the multicomponent protease enzyme Flavourzyme and its influence on the metabolism of the brewer's yeast strain Weihenstephan 34 / 70. The study underlines the importance of sufficient nitrogen availability during the course of <b>beer</b> <b>fermentation.</b> The applied metabolome and transcriptome analysis allowed mapping the effect of the wort sugar composition on the nitrogen uptake. Conclusion: Both the transcriptome and the metabolome analysis revealed that there is a significantly higher impact of protease addition for maltose syrup supplemented fermentations, while addition of glucose syrup to increase the gravity in the wort resulted in increased glucose repression that lead to inhibition of amino acid uptake and hereby inhibited the effect of the protease addition...|$|R
