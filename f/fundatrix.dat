50|$|Phylloxerans are aphid-like {{insects that}} are {{parasitic}} hemipterans on deciduous trees and perennial fruit crops. They feed on leaves and roots and are cecidogenic {{which means they}} induce galls to form. They have very complex life cycles with cyclical parthenogenesis and host alternation. Basically, here is briefly {{what happens in the}} life cycle: A female <b>fundatrix</b> hatches from an overwintering egg on the primary host which is usually a woody plant before bud burst stimulating a gall to form on the young leaves. Winged oﬀspring in the following or third generation migrate in spring to the secondary host (usually an herbaceous). Then, many winged and wingless generations may be produced on the secondary host before winged migrants return to the primary host in autumn. Males and mating females mate on the winter host and produce overwintering eggs.|$|E
50|$|P. spyrothecae is green, red {{or yellow}} {{in color and}} smooth to the touch. The outer surface of this species {{develops}} as {{the edges of the}} petiole of Populus nigra thicken, flatten and twist. In parallel to the petiole's shape, a gall forms into a spiral shape {{similar to that of the}} inside of a snail's shell. The <b>fundatrix,</b> or parthenogenetic female aphid produced on the primary host plant from an overwintering fertilized egg, is pale green; these individuals allow the second generation alatae to form within the gall. The Galls typically mature in late August to early September and change color from green to red over the course of maturation. At this stage, the alatae exit the gall through many small pores along the spirals' seams. In terms of geographical distribution, P. spyrothecae are distributed across Europe, North Africa (Tunisia), western Siberia, Pakistan and some locations within Canada.|$|E
50|$|In {{the former}} USSR, Aphis craccivora overwinters as eggs, {{often at the}} base of young alfalfa plants, but is also {{reported}} to overwinter on Acacia, camelthorn and perennial weeds. The eggs hatch in early spring and the first larvae are known as <b>fundatrix</b> (stem mothers) and feed at first on alfalfa. These aphids are all female and reproduce by parthenogenesis, producing nymphs which moult four times over the course of eight to twelve days. By the end of April, winged females have migrated to other host plants, often Acacia, and later to cotton, on which crop this pest does much damage. It may move back to alfalfa later in the year. In Belarus, lupine is an important host plant and in Ukraine, Acacia is most affected. A female aphid lives for 9 to 25 days and can produce from 25 to 125 young during its life. There may be up to twenty generations in the year. By November winged forms have developed and eggs are laid before winter sets in.|$|E
50|$|The sexual form {{begins with}} {{male and female}} eggs laid on the {{underside}} of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one winter egg in the bark of the vine's trunk. This egg develops into the leaf form. This nymph, the <b>fundatrix</b> (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs parthenogenetically in a leaf gall that she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the root form. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that stops it from healing. This poison eventually kills the vine. This nymph reproduces by laying eggs for up to seven more generations (which also can reproduce parthenogenetically) each summer. These offspring spread to other roots of the vine, or to the roots of other vines through cracks in the soil. The generation of nymphs that hatch in the autumn hibernate in the roots and emerge next spring when the sap begins to rise. In humid areas, the nymphs develop into the winged form, else they perform the same role without wings. These nymphs start the cycle again by either staying on the vine to lay male and female eggs on the bottom side of young grape leaves, or flying to an uninfected vine to do the same.|$|E

40|$|In certain aphids, first-instar nymphs {{defend their}} gall by attacking intruding {{arthropod}} predators. One correlate of such defensive behaviour is a lengthened {{duration of the}} first nymphal stadium during the galling phase of the life cycle. A prolonged first stadium allows a large army of first-instar defenders to accumulate, which may be advantageous for gall defence. The factors determining developmental delay have been unclear, however. Our field experiment with Pemphigus obesinymphae, a North American gall-forming aphid with defensive first-instar nymphs, tests whether first-stadium duration {{is influenced by the}} death of the colony's <b>fundatrix</b> (mother). We killed fundatrices in certain galls, left those in control galls alive, and counted aphids in each stadium in each gall. Galls in which fundatrices were killed contained a lower proportion of first-instar defenders and more late-instar nymphs than did galls with living fundatrices, indicating that maternal death dramatically increased developmental rate of nymphs. Possibly nymphal aphids respond adaptively to environmental cues that signal a threat to the colony's welfare. Alternatively, the <b>fundatrix</b> actively suppresses offspring development in order to maintain a large army of soldiers to protect her gall. The results add a new layer of complexity to our understanding of social aphid systems...|$|E

40|$|The plum mealy aphid Hyalopterus pruni Geoffr. {{is one of}} {{the main}} pest of the plum orchard at the S. D. Banu Maracine. An {{important}} link for controling this pest is the knowledge of the biological cycle, in order to establish the best moment for the treatments. The plum mealy aphid is an migratory species, with an holocyclic, dioecious development. This species produce damages in the plum orchard from Europe, Asia and northern Africa. The main host plant is the plum tree or other species belonging to the Prunus genra and as secondary host the plum mealy aphid prefere different graminaceae species as: Phragmites, Calamagrostis, Agrostis, etc. The research regarding the biology and ecology of the plum mealy aphid has been made at the Didactical Station Banu Maracine, Craiova, in a plum orchard, Stanley variety. During the 3 years of research the period for layings eggs has oscilated between 23 days in 2004 and 31 days in 2002. The development of the <b>fundatrix,</b> has been framed between 24 days in 2004 and 29 days in 2003. In 2002 the development of the <b>fundatrix</b> has been completed after 26 days.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{aggressive}} behavior of the gall-forming aphid Smynthurodes betae West. Videotaped behavior and experiments demonstrated that first instar offspring of the <b>fundatrix</b> protect their galling sites against con-specific competitors (the larger individuals win), as well as against first instar competitors of the sympatric galling aphid Forda riccobonii (Steph.). In mature galls, adult aphids also protect their gall and their offspring from conspecific invaders and natural enemies. The fighting behavior of the adult aphid is unique: the aphid seizes the intruder while lying on its back, enabling use of all six legs and the mouthparts. This is the first documentation of aggressive defensive behavior by adult aphids. Although the aggressive behavior of the adult aphid protects the gall and offspring, no distinct parental care behavior was observed. The territoriality and aggression are highly adaptive because of the limited num-ber of galling sites. Under natural conditions, removal of the adult aphids from the galls resulted in significantly increased invasion by conspecific intruders. The {{results indicate that the}} role of interspecific competition and natural ene...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHerbivorous insects {{frequently}} harbor bacterial symbionts {{that affect}} their ecology and evolution. Aphids host the obligatory endosymbiont Buchnera, which is required for reproduction, together with facultative symbionts whose frequencies vary across aphid populations. These maternally transmitted secondary symbionts have been particularly studied in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, which harbors at least 8 distinct bacterial species (not counting Buchnera) having environmentally dependent effects on host fitness. In particular, these symbiont species are associated with pea aphid populations feeding on specific plants. Although they are maternally inherited, these bacteria are occasionally transferred across insect lineages. One mechanism of such nonmaternal transfer is paternal transmission to the progeny during sexual reproduction. To date, transmission of secondary symbionts during sexual reproduction of aphids has been investigated in {{only a handful of}} aphid lineages and 3 symbiont species. To better characterize this process, we investigated inheritance patterns of 7 symbiont species during sexual reproduction of pea aphids through a crossing experiment involving 49 clones belonging to 9 host-specialized biotypes, and 117 crosses. Symbiont species in the progeny were detected with diagnostic qualitative PCR at the <b>fundatrix</b> stage hatching from eggs and in later parthenogenetic generations. We found no confirmed case of paternal transmission of symbionts to the progeny, and we observed that maternal transmission of a particular symbiont species (Serratia symbiotica) was quite inefficient. We discuss these observations in respect to the ecology of the pea aphid...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidental}} {{introduction of}} alien phytophagous {{insects and mites}} has become quite a common event in the world owing to intensive commercial exchanges of plants and goods and ever-increasing tourist traffic. There is evidence that this phenomenon is increasing, {{in spite of the}} control measures of the EU phytosanitary system in order to minimize unintentional introductions. The introduction of an alien species in a new ecosystem and the interaction between an alien species and the autochthonous species usually has many disadvantages. The alien species can dominate the invaded ecosystems and eventually become an invasive species due also to the absence or paucity of natural enemies. These invasions can affect the native species that become less common or threatened with extinction. Apart from the environmental impacts alien species are known for their economic and health impacts. In this study were investigated mostly 3 recently introduced alien species in Italy, namely Tuberocephalus (Trichosiphoniella) tianmushanensis Zang (Hemiptera Aphididae), Cydalima perspectalis (=Glyphodes) (Walker, 1859) (Lepidoptera Crambideae), the box caterpillar and Phenacoccus defectus Ferris (Rhynchota Pseudococcidae). The first chapter is a background of invasive ecology and presents with graphs the high number of alien species introduced in Europe the last years [...] The second chapter is dealing with Tuberocephalus (Trichosiphoniella) tianmushanensis Zang, an Asiatic heteroecious species so far not recorded in Italy. This species was collected in the University Botanical Garden of Padova in spring 2012. On May 30, 2012 reddish-pink galls, with aphids inside, were observed on the leaves of two Prunus subhirtella cv. pendula trees (Rosaceae) (Weeping Higan Cherry), about 40 years old. Once mounted on slides the aphids were identified as Tuberocephalus (Trichosiphoniella) tianmushanensis Zang. The purposes of this study were to collect data on species distribution over the territory, by monitoring ornamental cherry trees in the Veneto region, to observe the phenology and biology of the Asiatic aphid, to study the life-cycle in screen houses and outdoors, to verify if its secondary host plant was an Artemisia sp., as reported in bibliography. Another aspect of the work was to provide an overview of the species belonging to the genus Tuberocephalus so far described, by consulting the available literature. It was made an effort to gather all the currently available information for each species, its distribution and information on their biology mainly regarding the first and secondary host plants. Results showed that Tuberocephalus (T.) tianmushanensis, is now considered acclimatized in our environment. The aphid is closely related to the presence of its primary host Prunus subhirtella v. pendula with pink flowers. The aphid can carry on two generations on Prunus and can induce two types of leaf galls. The gall A is induced by the <b>fundatrix,</b> while the gall B is induced by the fundatrigeniae. The trial of colonization on Artemisia vulgaris, failed for the second successive year so possibly Artemisia vulgaris is not the secondary host plant of the aphid, as reported in literature. The third chapter concers Cydalima perspectalis (Lepidoptera, Crambiidae) (Walker, 1859), an asiatic pest of Buxus. It was reported {{for the first time in}} Europe in Germany in 2007. In Italy it was detected in 2011, in Lombardy, Como province. In a very short time it invaded the other northern regions and was recorded in Veneto in 2012. The larvae feed on leaves and shoots of the box trees and the infestations lead to defoliation of the plants. The objective of this study was to investigate the phenology of C. perspectalis. More precisely we examined the biological cycle of life, the number of molts and the overwintering stage. In addition host plants were monitored by regular samplings, from late winter to late fall to collect data on species distribution over the territory. The life-cycle was studied in screen houses and in the field, to investigate the role of potential predators and parasitoids. Additionally experiments were conducted with pheromones traps with the purpose of checking, monitoring and collecting data on species distribution over the territory, finding any possible differences based on climate, checking the potential differences between types of traps. According to the results of 2014 and 2015 in the Veneto Region C. perspectalis develops three generations / year. In 2014 the overwintering larvae started their activity early in February until mid-April while in 2015 one month later until end of April probably due to different climate conditions between these years. C. perspectalis overwinters in a silk cocoon in-between the leaves as a larva of 2 nd instar and the number of larval instar is 5. The number of captures from the sex pheromones traps was low. No differences were observed between the two types of pheromones. C. perspectalis has spread quickly in our environment proving that it has acclimatized. So far, it seems there has been no adaptation by indigenous natural enemies (parasitoids) to C. persectalis. The next chapter is focued on the difficulty to separate the Phenacoccus solani Ferris and P. defectus Ferris (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae). They are morphologically similar and the microscopic morphological characters of the adult female alone are not enough. In order to resolve their identity, a canonical variates morphological analysis of 199 specimens from different geographical origins and host plants and a molecular analysis of the CO 1 and 28 S genes were performed. The morphological analysis supported synonymy of the two species, as although the type specimens of the "species" are widely separated from each other in the canonical variates plot, they are all part of a continuous range of variation. The molecular analysis showed that P. solani and P. defectus are grouped in the same clade. On the basis of the morphological and molecular analyses, P. defectus is synonymized under the senior name P. solani, syn. n. Finally a zoogeographic analysis of the Greek scale insects fauna (Hemiptera, Coccoidea) was carried out with the aim to highlight how many alien scale insects species are so far present in the Greek territory. According to the last data, the scale insect fauna of whole Greek territory comprehends 207 species; a total of 187 species are recorded in mainland Greece and minor islands, whereas only 87 scale species are known so far in the island of Crete. The most numerous families are the Diaspididae, with 86 species in total, followed by Coccidae, with 35 species and by Pseudococcidae, with 34 species. The results of a first zoogeographical analysis of scale insect fauna of mainland Greece and the island of Crete is also presented. Five scale species, respectively four in mainland Greece and one in Crete, are considered as endemic. This analysis demonstrated that alien scale insects, introduced and acclimatized a long time ago or recent invaders, make up 30...|$|E
