500|$|... "It's confusing. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{let down}} with my {{releases}} from Aphrodite. I was caught {{out like a}} lot of artists were, with record companies figuring out how to do single releases these days. I remember doing a promo for one of the last singles and it just felt really old-fashioned. I'm pretty computer-savvy, something didn't feel right, but no one said anything to me. You get Britney releasing [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] and Gaga's [...] "Born This Way" [...] available on iTunes the day you hear it first. That's how it should be. And there's me waiting for a mid-week chart figure like it's 1989." ...|$|E
500|$|Emerson saw a kindred {{spirit in}} Very and defended his sanity. As {{he wrote to}} Margaret Fuller, [...] "Such a mind cannot be lost". Emerson was {{sympathetic}} with Very's plight because he himself had recently been ostracized after his controversial lecture, the [...] "Divinity School Address". He helped Very publish a small volume, Essays and Poems in 1839. The poems collected in this volume were chiefly Shakespearean sonnets. Very also published several poems in the Western Messenger between 1838 and 1840 {{as well as in}} The Dial, the journal of the Transcendentalists. He was disappointed, however, that Emerson, serving as editor of the journal, altered his poems. Very wrote to Emerson in July 1842, [...] "Perhaps they were all improvements but I preferred my own lines. I do not know but I ought to submit to such changes as done by the rightful authority of an Editor but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sad at the aspect of the piece." [...] He was never widely read, and was largely forgotten {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century, but in the 1830s and 1840s the Transcendentalists, including Emerson, as well as William Cullen Bryant, praised his work.|$|E
2500|$|After {{extensive}} touring {{in support}} of the band's third studio album, Veckatimest (2009), Grizzly Bear undertook a six-month hiatus from band-related activities. Vocalist Ed Droste noted, [...] "There was such a level of exhaustion that I really needed to pretend I wasn't in the band for a little bit. I needed to be back in my life with my friends and my spouse, and live a day-to-day existence {{that had nothing to do}} with music. That was really good for everybody." [...] Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen stated, [...] "Those were strange times. [...] <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit shell-shocked by the touring experience of Veckatimest and part of me was just wondering if there was some other version of a life that I could have that wasn't as heavily involved in the music industry." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Is it so wonderful?" [...] she answered. [...] "To {{tell you}} the truth, I was not sleepy, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>a</b> <b>little</b> walk. You can go back now, Bryan," [...] she said, turning to her maid. [...] "Mr. Mannering will see me home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can {{understand}} that," [...] she answered, [...] "unless {{they really had}} something definite to do. <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of that myself. I think London frightens me <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> It is {{so different from the}} country, and {{there is a great deal}} that is difficult to understand." ...|$|R
2500|$|Utley had a {{slow start}} to spring training. [...] He was hitting only [...]175 (10 for 57), {{including}} 1 double and 3 RBIs with just two games remaining. [...] Utley remained confident for the 2014 season. [...] "For younger guys, I think results make you feel better," [...] Utley said. [...] "But as you go, you realize they're not quite as important this time of year. Physically, I feel good. Early in the spring, I felt pretty decent at the plate. There were some times in the middle when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> uncomfortable and {{a little out of}} sorts. The last four or five days, I've started to feel a little more comfortable at the dish. For a guy that has done this for a few years, your game plan for Spring training is different than it would be during the regular season." [...] Despite a poor spring training, over {{the first two weeks of}} the season, he was [...] "the hottest hitter in baseball", and as of April 13, possessed a 1.314 on-base plus slugging (OPS) average.|$|E

6000|$|... "Dear co-guardian," [...] she murmured, [...] "to-night <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time so happy, {{as though}} {{all the good}} things in life were close at hand. Then I watched you come up, and your step seemed so heavy, and you stooped as though you had a load on your shoulders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '7 P.M.--The vessel {{went off}} at 10.30 A.M. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while rather forlorn, and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sinking at the heart. You see I confess it all, how silly! Can't I {{after so many}} years bear to be left in one sense alone? I read <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of you know what Book, and then found the feeling pass entirely away.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an article}} by The Palm Beach Post, Mindy McGillivray stated that in January 2003, when she was 23 years old, she was groped by Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate. She said, [...] "All of <b>a</b> sudden <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> grab, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> nudge. I think it's friend Ken Davidoff's camera bag, {{that was my first}} instinct. I turn around and there's Donald. He sort of looked away quickly." [...] Ken Davidoff, a photographer, corroborated McGillivray's account, saying he remembered her pulling him aside moments after the alleged {{incident}} to say [...] "Donald just grabbed my ass!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Something of the kind, though I did {{not expect}} to do it all myself. While I was sure the thing was feasible, the fact that I was, or so <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> taking <b>a</b> <b>little</b> share in {{bringing}} it about was sufficient for me. Now, however, I am not quite so sure on any point as I used to be, which is why I often envy Ingleby." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was scared}} of being out of place, of not being {{accepted}} by the fans and the team, of being seen as a foreigner who was taking the place of local players," [...] he recalled. [...] "Every time I went to the national side, I had to prove that I deserved to wear the shirt. <b>I</b> also <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> self-conscious about the fact I don’t speak Greek very well, even though I understand it." ...|$|R
6000|$|My {{entrance}} into print came about through my good friend, Mr. Hurd, the book reviewer of the Transcript. For him I {{began to write}} an occasional critical article or poem just to try my hand. One of my regular [...] "beats" [...] was up the three long flights of stairs which led to Hurd's little den above Washington Street, for there <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> myself <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more of the literary man, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> nearer the current of American fiction.|$|R

60|$|My mortification and {{apprehension}} {{were somewhat}} mitigated when I observed that Edd was dirty, ragged, {{and almost as}} much disheveled as I was. I had feared he would see in my appearance certain unmistakable evidences that I had made a tenderfoot blunder and then run for my life. But Edd took my loss of hat, and torn coat, and general bedraggled state {{as a matter of}} course. Indeed <b>I</b> somehow <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pride at his acceptance of me there in the flesh.|$|R
60|$|Yesterday morning I was so unwell that I {{wrote to}} Frank Beard, from whom I shall doubtless hear to-morrow. I mention it, only {{in case you}} should come in his way, for I know how perversely such things fall out. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more {{exertion}} to read afterwards, and I passed a sleepless night after that again; but otherwise I am in good force and spirits to-day. I may say, in the best force.|$|R
60|$|The eventful hour had arrived; for {{the first}} time in my life I was to ascend a ship's mast. Had I been well and hearty, perhaps <b>I</b> should have <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> shaky at the thought; but as I was then, weak and faint, the bare thought appalled me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Beggars {{must not}} be choosers, you know, Colonel Osborne. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{disappointed}} when I found {{that we were not}} to see them till February next." ...|$|E
60|$|His manner was {{far from}} {{encouraging}} and his face wore a severe expression. Altogether <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> nervous. But {{it had to be}} done, so I began.|$|E
6000|$|... '"You can't stop 'em," [...] I said. [...] "There's twenty-two {{other men}} besides me." [...] <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more 'ud set me {{screaming}} like a wired hare.|$|E
60|$|She bore no resentment, though <b>I</b> myself <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> uneasy. Life {{was like}} that, {{she seemed to}} imply, {{and she had been}} no party to it. There was no doubt a better world where things would be different--it was {{extraordinary}} what a number of conflicting sentiments she could convey in a pause or a shut of her mouth. Black and erect, she sat glooming over that alien teapot, sipping Mrs Monnerie's colourless China tea, firmly declining to grimace at its insipidity, until she had told me all there was to tell.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{for most}} people that seek genital piercings nowaday, a sense of {{uniqueness}} and non-conformism prevails: ″My VCH piercing {{is one of my}} favorite things about myself. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>a</b> freaky <b>little</b> celebrity walking around with my secret piercing. It makes me feel unique, badass and sexy.″ - Ray Gallagher ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{compelled}} to admit that there was much truth in the observation, but still felt unwilling to give up all claim to having assisted in slaying our first buffalo. I pondered the subject a good deal during {{the remainder of the}} time we spent in cutting up and packing part of the buffalo meat, and in preparing to continue our journey, but could come at no satisfactory conclusion in my own mind, and, to say truth, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> not <b>a</b> <b>little</b> crestfallen at my conduct in the whole affair.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> disappointed: Bruno's {{conception}} of the part seemed so wanting in dignity. [...] "Won't he say any more of the speech?" [...] I whispered to Sylvie.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> flurried when we drew up at {{the house}} in Eaton Square, and the tall footman knocked at the door, in a way I thought {{unnecessarily}} loud and important.|$|E
6000|$|... "I remember, once, I {{played a}} sort of joke on George, just to try him. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> mean about it afterward, because I never ought to have doubted he'd do it.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not often}} we {{permitted}} ourselves such luxuries, {{but as we}} left the theatre I caught a glimpse of Isobel's white face, more clearly visible now than in the dimly lit box, and I knew that, bravely though she had carried herself through the whole of that trying evening, she was not far from breaking down. So I called a hansom, and she sank back in a corner with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sigh of relief. I lit a cigarette, and suddenly <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> cold <b>little</b> hand steal into mine. I set my teeth and held it firmly.|$|R
2500|$|While polls {{attributed}} Davis' declining popularity to {{the energy}} and budget problems, some newspaper articles and commentators have identified other issues that limited his effectiveness and political appeal. Davis, a moderate, had some disagreements with the more liberal Democratic-controlled Legislature. Democrat John L. Burton, {{the leader of the}} California State Senate, was Davis' chief antagonist. In 2003, Republican leader Jim Brulte told The Los Angeles Times that Davis lacked the basics of political collegiality to pull him through hard times. [...] "I never <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> got to know him ... <b>I</b> always <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sorry for him".|$|R
6000|$|... "Anne, did {{you ever}} get on a street car and then {{discover}} that you hadn't any money with you to pay your fare? I did, the other day. It's quite awful. I had a nickel with me when I got on the car. I thought it was in the left pocket of my coat. When I got settled down comfortably <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> for it. It wasn't there. I had <b>a</b> cold chill. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> in the other pocket. Not there. I had another chill. Then <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> inside pocket. All in vain. I had two chills at once.|$|R
