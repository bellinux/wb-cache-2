5|$|The Eighteenth Dynasty tombs {{within the}} valley vary {{quite a bit}} in decoration, style, and location. It seems that at first there was no fixed plan. The tomb of Hatshepsut has a unique shape, {{twisting}} and turning down over 200metres from the entrance, so that the burial chamber is 97metres below the surface. The tombs gradually became more regular and formalised, and those of Thutmose III and Thutmose IV, KV34 and KV43, are <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> Eighteenth Dynasty tombs, both with their bent axis, and simple decoration.|$|E
5|$|Shadow of Mordor was Monolith's first third-person open world {{video game}} for the eighth {{generation}} consoles PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and de Plater considered its development an educational experience for the studio. In Monolith's introduction to the genre, many core mechanics were built from scratch and the studio were inspired by successful video games such as the Batman: Arkham series created by Rocksteady Studios; those games inspired Shadow of Mordor stealth and free-flow combat mechanics. The studio considered Rocksteady's games <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> {{how to handle a}} licensed title.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> {{horizontal}} water mills, {{also known}} as Norse or Clack Mills, around Dutch Loch. Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs, built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill-stone was sited. Inside the building there was a fixed lower millstone, and a rotating upper millstone driven by the water falling onto the paddles below. Some were still in use on Papa Stour {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of Clumlie, at Troswick in the south Mainland of Shetland.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} other large tombs from the 18th {{century in the}} churchyard—some of which are <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> the use of {{artificial}} Coade stone, popular at the time—and several brass and stone memorial tablets inside the church from the 16th century onwards. George Hutchinson has a prominent wall memorial in the chancel {{in addition to his}} tomb outside; local sculptor Richard Joanes designed it, and there are Coade stone embellishments. Other carved tablets, such as those to Reverend Lewin and Nicholas Spencer, are by obscure London-based mid-19th-century sculptor T. Marsh.|$|E
5|$|Tessellations are {{patterns}} {{formed by}} repeating tiles all over a flat surface. There are 17 wallpaper groups of tilings. While common {{in art and}} design, exactly repeating tilings are less easy to find in living things. The cells in the paper nests of social wasps, and the wax cells in honeycomb built by honey bees are well-known examples. Among animals, bony fish, reptiles or the pangolin, or fruits like the salak are protected by overlapping scales or osteoderms, these form more-or-less exactly repeating units, though often the scales in fact vary continuously in size. Among flowers, the snake's head fritillary, Fritillaria meleagris, have a tessellated chequerboard pattern on their petals. The structures of minerals provide <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> regularly repeating three-dimensional arrays. Despite {{the hundreds of thousands}} of known minerals, there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a crystal, defined by crystal structure, crystal system, and point group; for example, there are exactly 14 Bravais lattices for the 7 lattice systems in three-dimensional space.|$|E
5|$|There are 35 royal tombs and 155 tumuli {{in central}} Gyeongju, and 421 tumuli in the {{outskirts}} of the city. Silla burial mounds built after the period of the Three Kingdoms are found in central Gyeongju, including tumuli in the districts of Noseo-dong, Nodong-dong, Hwangnam-dong, Hwango-dong and Inwang-dong. Western Gyeongju has the tomb of King Muyeol in Seoak-dong, nearby tumuli in Chunghyo-dong and the tomb of Kim Yu-sin. The tombs of Queen Seondeok, King Sinmun, King Hyogong and King Sinmu are at the base of Namsan mountain while the tombs of King Heongang, King Jeonggang, King Gyeongmyeong and King Gyeongae are on the slopes of the mountain. In addition to the tombs, tumuli have been found surrounding Namsan mountain and {{in the western part of}} Geumgang mountain. Artifacts excavated from the tombs of Geumgwanchong (gold crown tomb), Seobongchong (western phoenix tomb), Cheonmachong (heavenly horse tomb) and northern and southern parts of Tomb No. 98 are <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> Silla culture.|$|E

5|$|To {{build their}} nests, {{termites}} primarily use faeces, which have many desirable properties as a construction material. Other building materials include partly digested plant material, used in carton nests (arboreal nests built from faecal elements and wood), and soil, used in subterranean nest and mound construction. Not all nests are visible, as many nests in tropical forests are located underground. Species in the subfamily Apicotermitinae are <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> subterranean nest builders, as they only dwell inside tunnels. Other termites live in wood, and tunnels are constructed as they {{feed on the}} wood. Nests and mounds protect the termites' soft bodies against desiccation, light, pathogens and parasites, {{as well as providing}} a fortification against predators. Nests made out of carton are particularly weak, and so the inhabitants use counter-attack strategies against invading predators.|$|E

25|$|After the {{war over}} 800 W/NG {{motorcycles}} were supplied to the Danish Army between 1946 and 1947. The remaining W/NGs that survived were mostly converted back into civilian specification for resale by dealers, so <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> the military model are now rare.|$|E
25|$|The clean {{lines of}} the civil {{architecture}} in Edo influenced the sukiya style of residential architecture. Katsura Detached Palace and Shugaku-in Imperial Villa {{on the outskirts of}} Kyōto are <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> this style. Their architecture has simple lines and decor and uses wood in its natural state.|$|E

25|$|The Mississippian {{period in}} Louisiana was when Plaquemine and the Caddoan Mississippian {{cultures}} developed and extensive maize agriculture was adopted. The Plaquemine {{culture in the}} lower Mississippi River Valley in western Mississippi and eastern Louisiana began in 1200 CE and continued to about 1400 CE. <b>Good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> this culture are the Medora Site in West Baton Rouge Parish, and the Emerald Mound, Winterville and Holly Bluff sites in Mississippi.|$|E

25|$|An oast, oast {{house or}} hop kiln is a {{building}} designed for kilning (drying) hops {{as part of}} the brewing process. They can be found in most hop-growing (and former hop-growing) areas and are often <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> vernacular architecture. Many redundant oasts have been converted into houses. The names oast and oast house are used interchangeably in Kent and East Sussex. In Surrey, Hampshire, Hereford and Worcester they are always called hop kilns.|$|E
25|$|The Lady chapel forms a bright, spacious part of {{the church}} dating from the 13th century. It is an {{extension}} of the north transept. The interior carving around the windows and arches features ball-flower motif of the Decorated Period. The present windows and the windows of the north transept are <b>good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> curvilinear tracery, typical {{of the first half of}} the 14th century, although the glass is from a later period. Traces of the original window arches are still visible.|$|E
25|$|Where the sea meets higher {{parts of}} the sloping landscape, {{dramatic}} cliffs emerge very suddenly. Such cliffs are white if the soil has a high content of chalk. Typically like White Cliffs of Dover, but in Scania and parts of Denmark the soil is usually more sandy, and the cliffs then becomes yellow instead. <b>Good</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> such coastlines exists at the southern side of Ven in Øresund, and also between the towns Helsingborg and Landskrona, as well as {{parts of the}} Scanian south and south-east coast. Where the cliffs aren't steep enough, they may become overgrown with grass.|$|E
