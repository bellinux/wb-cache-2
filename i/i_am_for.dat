This led to 1972's Who Came First, a more widespread release, 15 {{percent of the}} revenue of which went to the Baba association. A further limited release, With Love, was released in 1976. A limited-edition boxed set of all three limited releases on CD, Avatar, was released in 2000, with all profits going to the Avatar Meher Baba Trust in India, which provided funds to a dispensary, school, hospital and pilgrimage centre.|$|E
25|$|If {{you wish}} you may tell the police {{to be careful not}} to rile me. Of course, I am a {{reasonable}} spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>for</b> it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.|$|E

500|$|Bazy (then Miller) was {{publisher}} of the newspaper for only 19 months. By April 1951, McCormick and his niece developed differences of opinions over both the newspaper and her relationship with Garvin Tankersley. She later said, [...] "I understood when I went to the Times-Herald I was to have full control. That control was not given me... There is some difference in our political beliefs. I have broader Republican views than [...] has. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>for</b> the same people as the colonel, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>for</b> some more people." [...] McCormick also told her to decide between Garvin Tankersley and the Tribune Company. As a result, she resigned from the Times-Herald. McCormick tried to run the paper himself, but lost money on the venture, and sold the Times-Herald to The Washington Post in 1954. When he announced the sale, one of the paper's board members insisted that Bazy Tankersley be {{given a chance to}} purchase it, so McCormick gave her 48 hours to match the $10 million asking price. She could not raise the money to do so. Upon the purchase of the Times-Herald, the Post consolidated its market position by discontinuing the rival paper. Though estranged for many years, Bazy and McCormick reconciled prior to his death.|$|E

500|$|Fonda, in The Huffington Post, {{said she}} regretted {{some of the}} {{language}} used in the original protest letter and how it [...] "was perhaps too easily misunderstood. It certainly has been wildly distorted. Contrary to the lies that have been circulated, the protest letter was not demonizing Israeli films and filmmakers." [...] She continued, writing [...] "the greatest 're-branding' of Israel would be to celebrate that country's long standing, courageous and robust peace movement by helping to end the blockade of Gaza through negotiations with all parties to the conflict, and by stopping the expansion of West Bank settlements. That's the way to show Israel's commitment to peace, not a PR campaign. There will be no two-state solution unless this happens." [...] Fonda emphasized that she, [...] "in no way, support the destruction of Israel. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>for</b> the two-state solution. I have been to Israel many times and love the country and its people." [...] Several prominent Atlanta Jews subsequently signed a letter to The Huffington Post rejecting the vilification of Fonda, who they described as [...] "a strong supporter and friend of Israel".|$|E
500|$|On 15 August 1915, Tatiana {{wrote her}} mother another letter expressing {{her desire to}} help her bear the burdens {{brought on by the}} war: [...] "I simply can't tell you how awfully sorry <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>for</b> you, my beloved ones. I am so sorry I can in no way help you or be useful. In such moments I am sorry I'm not a man." [...] As Tatiana grew into adulthood, she {{undertook}} more public appearances than her sisters and headed committees. Vyrubova recalled that she became better known to the public than her three sisters because of her attention to duty and her ability to engage those she met. In their memoirs, both her mother's friend, Vyrubova, and lady in waiting Lili Dehn recalled that Tatiana, the most social of the sisters, longed for friends her own age but her social life was restricted by her rank and her mother's distaste for society. She also had a more introspective side, known only to her closest friends and family. [...] "With her, as with her mother, shyness and reserve were accounted as pride, but, once you knew her and had gained her affection, this reserve disappeared and the real Tatiana became apparent," [...] Dehn recalled. [...] "She was a poetical creature, always yearning for the ideal, and dreaming of great friendships which might be hers." ...|$|E
500|$|The new Constitution {{empowered}} {{the president}} to appoint executive department heads {{with the consent of}} the Senate. Three departments had existed under the Articles of Confederation: the Department of War, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Finance Office. The Department of War was retained, while the latter two departments became the Department of State and the Department of the Treasury, respectively. The leaders of these three departments constituted the initial positions in Washington's cabinet. In September 1789, Congress established the position of Attorney General to serve as the chief legal adviser to the president. Though the Attorney General did not oversee a department (the United States Department of Justice would be established in 1870), the position nonetheless became a part of the cabinet. Edmund Randolph became the first Attorney General, while Henry Knox retained his position as head of the Department of War and Thomas Jefferson served as the first Secretary of State. For the key post of Secretary of the Treasury, which would oversee economic policy, Washington chose Alexander Hamilton, after his first choice, Robert Morris, declined. Morris had recommended Hamilton instead, writing [...] "But, my dear general, you will be no loser by my declining the secrataryship of the Treasury, for I can recommend a far cleverer fellow than <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>for</b> your minister of finance in the person of your aide-de-camp, Colonel Hamilton." [...] Washington's initial cabinet consisted of one individual from New England (Knox), one individual from the mid-Atlantic (Hamilton), and two Southerners (Jefferson and Randolph).|$|E
