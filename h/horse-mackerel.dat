60|$|Sam Johnson is from Norway. His {{ancestors}} {{lived by}} fishing. Sam knows and loves the sea. He {{has been a}} sailor before the mast, but he is more fisherman than sailor. He is a stalwart man, with an iron, stern, weather-beaten face and keen blue eyes, and he has an arm like the branch of an oak. For many years {{he has been a}} market fisherman at Seabright, where on off days he pursued the <b>horse-mackerel</b> for the fun of it, and which earned him his name. Better than any man I ever met Sam knows the sea; he knows fish, he knows boats and engines. And I have reached a time in my experience of fishing where I want that kind of a boatman.|$|E
6000|$|The deserted {{streets were}} long lines with an unclean central gutter. Some {{of the stone}} houses were tall, grand, solid, and stately; such are the {{pavilion}} of the Counts of Salazar, the huge, heavy abode of the Marquesses de Nava, and the mansions of the Villanuevas del Pardo. But yellow fever had driven away half of the population--10,000 souls, who could easily be 20,000--and had barricaded the houses to the curious stranger. Most of them, faced and porticoed with florid pillars, were mere dickies opening upon nothing, and only the huge armorial bearings showed that they had ever been owned. Mixed with these 'palaces.' were 'cat-faced cottages' and pauper, mildewed tenements, whose rusty iron-work, tattered planks, and broken windows gave them a truly dreary and dismal appearance. The sole noticeable movement was a tendency to gravitate in the roofs. The principal growth, favoured by the vapour-laden air, was of grass in the thoroughfares, of moss on the walls, and of the 'fat weed' upon the tiles. The horse-leek (sempervivum urbium), brought from Madeira, was first described by the 'gifted Swede' Professor Smith, who died on the Congo River. Finally, though the streets are wide and regular, and the large town is well aired by four squares, the whole aspect was strongly suggestive of the cocineros (cooks), as {{the citizens of the}} capital are called by the sons of the capital-port. They retort by terming their rival brethren chicharreros, or fishers of the chicharro (<b>horse-mackerel,</b> Caranx Cuvieri.) ...|$|E
60|$|But, {{such is the}} {{persistence}} of mankind {{in general and the}} doggedness of fishermen in particular, Captain Dan and I kept on roaming the seas in search of tuna. Nothing more was seen or heard of the great drifting schools. They had gone down the channel toward Mexico, down with the mysterious currents of the sea, fulfilling their mission in life. However, different anglers reported good-sized tuna off Seal Rocks and Silver Cañon. Several fish were hooked. Mr. Reed brought in a one-hundred-and-forty-one-pound tuna that took five hours to land. It made a dogged, desperate resistance and was almost unbeatable. Mr. Reed is a heavy, powerful man, and he said this tuna gave him the hardest task he ever attempted. I wondered what I would have done with one of those two-or three-hundred-pounders. There is a difference between Pacific and Atlantic tuna. The latter are seacows compared to these blue pluggers of the West. I have hooked several very large tuna along the Seabright coast, and, though these fish got away, they did not give me the battle I have had with small tuna of the Pacific. Mr. Wortheim, fishing with my old boatman, <b>Horse-mackerel</b> Sam, landed a two-hundred-and-sixty-two-pound Atlantic tuna in less than two hours. Sam said the fish made a loggy, rolling, easy fight. Crowninshield, also fishing with Sam, caught one weighing three hundred pounds in rather short order. This sort of feat cannot be done out here in the Pacific. The deep water here {{may have something to do}} with it, but the tuna are different, if not in species, then in disposition.|$|E
40|$|The {{existing}} population {{model for}} the <b>horse-mackerel</b> resource is extended to take commercial catch-at-length information from the mid-water trawl fishery and demersal surveys into account to allow the estimation of recruitment variations, which are correlated with the results for <b>horse-mackerel</b> abundance (considered to primarily reflect recruits) from the November pelagic surveys. Correlation is better with results for the West coast only from these surveys, rather than with those for the assessment area as a whole. At this stage the conclusion is either that these November survey estimates are (for whatever reason) a relatively weak predictor of incoming <b>horse-mackerel</b> recruitment strength, or that {{there are problems with}} the modelling of the demersal/midwater data which require further attention...|$|E
40|$|<b>Horse-mackerel</b> (Trachurus mediterraneus Aleev), {{is a major}} {{commercial}} fish in the Black Sea waters. This {{species from}} the Bulgarian Black Sea pelagic community have been {{recognized as one of}} the most ecologically and economically important food resource. Diet composition and feeding intensity of the <b>horse-mackerel,</b> collected on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast were examined. This study showed that, Crustacea (Copepoda, Cladocera, Mysidacea, Amphipoda, Isopoda, and Decapoda), Polychaeta and Pisces constituted the main prey groups. From investigated prey groups most important for the diet of <b>horse-mackerel</b> are Mysidacea and Pisces, as Mysidacea reached 35 % in the stomachs of the size group TL= 11 cm and Pisces (Engraulis engrasicolus L. and Sprattus sprattus L.) accounted for 55. 11 % in 15 cm size class. Dynamics of the lipids content deposited in the body was investigated. Established percentage of lipids in the body of the <b>horse-mackerel</b> is a good indicator of physiological status of shoals before spawning period and it represents readiness for successful breeding. Catches carried out by both the trawler vessels and trap nets are presented as well. <b>Horse-mackerel</b> has a delicious meat and provides a full meal for the population.

40|$|Málaga Bay is an {{important}} area from the icthyoplankton viewpoint where {{it is possible to}} find more than 80 species belonging to 68 genera and 41 families. Furthermore, the bay is an essential spawning and nursery area for many species of commercial interest, such as sardine (Sardina pilchardus), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), Atlantic <b>horse-mackerel</b> (Trachurus trachurus), Mediterranean <b>horse-mackerel</b> (T. mediterraneus) or hake (Merluccius merluccius). Local bottom trawl, purse seine and polyvalent artisanal fleets, have traditionally fished in this bay targeting on many species of fishes, crustaceans and molluscs. An ecological and fisheries study was undertaken in 2013 and 2014 with the purpose of assessing the suitability of Málaga Bay as a Fishery Protected Area. One of the important aspects taken into account is the spatial distribution of the fishing effort to evaluate its impact in the area. The findings achieved in this study are essential and valuable information for a proper fisheries management integrating the ecosystem-based approach into fisheries advice. The results show that Málaga Bay supports a heavy fishing pressure in all the fishing grounds which may affect both its commercial resources and sedimentary habitats. Versión del edito...|$|E

40|$|Sun-dried <b>horse-{{mackerel}}</b> or mackerel muscle slices were vacuum-packed or packed {{together with}} air or nitrogen gas in cellophane polyethylen bags, and stored at 5 - 12 °C. The changes of oil contained in fish muscles {{during the period}} of drying of the muscles and storage of the dried muscles were studied by organoleptic test and measuring 2 -thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value and peroxide value (POV). Both TBA value and POV increased through the period of drying, but decreased through the period of storage in the bag. Among the types of packaging, there was no clear defference in the effect on the changes of the oil in dried fish muscle. Both TBA value and POV, however, of fish oil which was packed under vacuum or packed together with air in the bag, increased through the period of storage. The values of the vacuum-packed oil were lower than those of the oil packed together with air. This shows that vacuum packaging is effective in retarding the changes of the oil. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of the knowledge of food and feeding habits of a fish in understanding its fishery biology has been very well established. Often it helps in finding out the seasonal variations {{in the distribution of}} a fish species. Sometimes the rate of feeding has a bearing on the spawning of the fish. The nature of the food composition of a fish will also throw light on the possible habitats it frequents. Chidambaram and Venkataraman (1946), Chacko and Mathew (1955) and Kagwade (1965) have given short accounts of the food of Caranx kalla. The food and feeding habits of the different species of the <b>horse-mackerel</b> have been described briefly in the works of Datar (1954), Kuthalingam (1955, ' 59) and Tandon (1960).

40|$|Objective echoes {{identification}} {{is not possible}} nowadays when several species are present in an area. Mid-water trawl catches are usually used to split fish schools into species during acoustic surveys. Moreover it is weIl known that because of a lively behaviour {{of these types of}} species, the catchability may vary a lot from one species to another. Therefore, in order to verify the reliability of identification by trawling, 68 hauls carried out during 4 acoustic surveys (1991 - 1994) have been analysed. Five pelagic species (anchovy, mackerel, <b>horse-mackerel,</b> sprat and sardine), observed during these surveys in Bay of Biscay were considered. On the one hand, taking into account the vertical echo-sounder data and the vertical course of the trawl from nets onde data, a theoretical weight was calculated, and compared with the real catch. The results showed that catchability varied a lot between species and within species according to school structure. On the other hand, a vertical avoidance of fish was simulated by changing the vertical trawl position to approach the real catch and study specific behaviours which could bias the identification. As a result, it seems that trawl species compositions could be used with a better precision by applying a correcting factor according to specific catchabilities if completed by an aggregation classification...|$|E
40|$|The North Sea has {{a diverse}} forage fish assemblage, {{including}} herring, targeted for human consumption; sandeel, sprat, and Norway pout, exploited by industrial fisheries; and some sardine and anchovy, supporting small-scale fisheries. All show large abundance fluctuations, impacting on fisheries and predators. We review field, laboratory, and modelling studies {{to investigate the}} drivers of this complex system of forage fish. Climate clearly influences forage fish productivity; however, any single-species considerations {{of the influence of}} climate might fail if strong interactions between forage fish exist, as in the North Sea. Sandeel appears {{to be the most important}} prey forage fish. Seabirds are most dependent on forage fish, due to specialized diet and distributional constraints (breeding colonies). Other than fisheries, key predators of forage fish are a few piscivorous fish species including saithe, whiting, mackerel, and <b>horse-mackerel,</b> exploited in turn by fisheries; seabirds and seals have a more modest impact. Size-based foodweb modelling suggests that reducing fishing mortality may not necessarily lead to larger stocks of piscivorous fish, especially if their early life stages compete with forage fish for zooplankton resources. In complex systems, changes in the impact of fisheries on forage fish may have potentially complex (and perhaps unanticipated) consequences on other commercially and/or ecologically important species. © 2013 © Crown copyright...|$|E

The sample, carp (Cyprinus carpio), <b>horse-mackerel</b> (Decapters muroadsi) and mackerel (Scomber tapeincephalus) were divided into three different killing grups, the one was instant death which was killed cutting head off immediately after the catch. The second grup of fish was death in agony which was death after struggling for several minutes on floor board, and the last grup was died by electric shocks. The results were summarized in Fig. 1 5 and Table 1, the phenomena were observed as follows. 1) The longer becomes the lapse of time after its death the less becomes the amount of myosin-fraction, and after being kept for 20 - 25 hours at 25 °C its trace fades away entirely. 2) Temporal increasing of myosin fraction, disappearing of ATP, and death rigor-finish take place almost simultaneously; in case of the fish meat kept at 25 °C occurring about 8 hours after its death. 3) The changing mode {{of the amount of}} glycolytic products in muscle, except that of glycogen, keeps nearly same state throughout the above mentioned dying conditions, but the breakdown - rate of ATP and Phosphagen is more early at the muscle of the instant death-fish than at that of the gradual death-fish, while no difference in the changing tendency is observed between instant death-fish and electric shock one. ...|$|E
40|$|ECOCÁDIZ‐RECLUTAS 1009 {{survey is}} the first attempt by the IEO of acoustically {{assessing}} the abundance of anchovy and sardine juveniles in their main recruitment areas off the Gulf of Cádiz. The survey was conducted between 26 th October and 5 th November 2009 onboard the Spanish R/V Emma Bardán. In order to achieve a better sampling coverage of juveniles, the acoustic sampling grid was more intensive (4 nm‐spaced transects) than the adopted one in conventional surveys. Unfortunately, the initially planned survey area limits and the ship‐time available (17 transects over waters shallower than 50 m depth between Tavira and Chipiona, and 11 days) showed both insufficient due to a deeper bathymetric distribution of anchovy juveniles than expected and the sucession {{of a series of}} unforeseen problems which led to drastically reduce the actual sampled area to only 6 transects from the easternmost zone. Acoustic estimates from this last area are available for anchovy (2 771 t, 524 million fish), sardine (25 167 t, 500 millions), chub mackerel (17 627 t, 152 millions) and Mediterranean <b>horse‐mackerel</b> (17 005 t, 159 millions). The abundance and biomass of age 0 anchovies in the surveyed area were estimated at 2 588 t and 510 million fish, respectively, i. e. 93 % and 97 % of the total estimated anchovy biomass and abundance. Sardine estimates were not age‐structured but the abundance and biomass of juveniles smaller than 17 cm were estimated at 3 382 t and 130 millions, 13 % and 26 % of the total estimated species’ biomass and abundance. An approximate evaluation {{of the impact of the}} incomplete coverage of the anchovy juvenile distribution during the survey was carried out by comparison of our data with the resulting yields and location of positive fishing stations from a groundfish survey carried out just after the present survey.

40|$|We {{studied the}} use of {{demersal}} trawler discards by scavenging seabirds at one location in the western Mediterranean (Benidorm, SE Spain) {{from the end of}} June to the beginning of October 2000. Yellow-legged gull and Cory's shearwater were the most common species in the study area (52. 35 %, 35. 49 %) and behind boats (82. 4 %, 7. 07 %). Eight other seabird species were observed in much lower numbers following boats (Audouin's gull 2. 6 %, black-headed gull 2. 3 %, sandwich 1. 5 %, black 0. 82 % and common terns 0. 97 %, Balearic shearwaters 1. 4 %, storm-petrel 0. 52 % and shags 0. 36 %). Yellow-legged gulls were present behind trawlers in higher numbers than might have been expected by its abundance at sea, whereas Cory's shearwaters were less so. The discarded fish (>discard>) comprised mainly of sardine (22. 4 %), flatfish (19. 1 %) and <b>horse-mackerel</b> (17. 3 %) and included fish of a small size (median 10. 5 cm) in the main. Yellow-legged gull made the largest use of discards, albeit lower than expected by its Presence Index. Average percentage consumption was about 54 % of the edible discards, suggesting that yellow-legged gulls were not highly efficient at catching >discard>. The average ratio of fish discarded over fish landed was ca. 65 %, although the range was very variable (23 - 175 %).

40|$|The present working {{document}} summarises the main {{results from the}} Spanish (pelagic ecosystem‐) acoustic survey conducted by IEO between 2 nd and 13 th August 2013 in the Portuguese and Spanish shelf waters (20 ‐ 200 m isobaths) off the Gulf of Cadiz onboard the R/V “Cornide de Saavedra”. The survey dates were somewhat delayed {{in relation to the}} usual ones and to the anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) peak spawning as well. Abundance and biomass estimates are given for all the mid‐sized and small pelagic fish species susceptible of being acoustically assessed according to their occurrence and abundance levels in the study area. The distribution of these species is also shown from the mapping of their back‐scattering energies. The bulk of the anchovy population was concentrated in the Spanish shelf, with a residual nucleus to the west of Cape Santa Maria. A delay of the usual survey dates may be the reason of a higher relative importance of smaller anchovies in the population as a probable consequence of the incorporation of the first waves of recently recruited juveniles to the adult population. The total biomass estimated for anchovy was 8. 5 thousand tonnes (609 million fish), the lowest estimate in its series. Sardine showed a distribution pattern almost complementary to that described for anchovy, with higher densities occurring over the inner‐middle shelf of both extremes of the surveyed area, mainly west to Cape Santa Maria, and in shallower waters than anchovy. Sardine yielded a total of 9. 7 thousand tonnes (232 million fish). The 2013 sardine estimate was also the lowest one in its series and corroborates a clear recent decline in the population which has also been evidenced by the PELAGO surveys. Chub mackerel was present all over the surveyed area although showed a more “oceanic” distribution in the westernmost waters. The species was the most important in terms of assessed biomass, rendering estimates of 31. 3 thousand tonnes (333 million fish).

40|$|The present working {{document}} summarises the main {{results from the}} Spanish acoustic (pelagic ecosystem‐) survey conducted by IEO between 25 th July and 1 st August 2010 in the Portuguese (but with an incomplete coverage) and Spanish shelf waters (20 ‐ 200 m isobaths) off the Gulf of Cadiz onboard the R/V “Cornide de aavedra”. The survey season was coincident with the anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) peak spawning to achieve an acoustic estimate of its SSB {{in the study area}} as well. This year the surveyed area was reduced to an area limited by the waters placed between Cape Trafalgar and Cape Santa Maria. Abundance and biomass estimates are given for all the mid‐sized and small pelagic fish species susceptible of being acoustically assessed according to their occurrence and abundance levels in the study area. The distribution of these species is also shown from the mapping of their back‐scattering energies. In the sampled area, anchovy was distributed all over the shelf of the study area with the densest concentrations being recorded over the middle‐outer shelf in the westernmost area. The total biomass estimated for anchovy was 12. 3 thousand tonnes (954 million fish) and sustained, as an average, by maller anchovies than those observed the last year. Sardine (Sardina pilchardus) occurred all over the inner‐middle shelf, in shallower waters than anchovy, and also showing the highest densities in the westernmost coastal waters of the sampled area. The species was the most important one in terms of both biomass (67 thousand tonnes) and abundance (2 thousand million fish) and showed vidences of a relatively good recruitment. Chub mackerel (Scomber colias) was almost absent in the shallower waters and in the whole central part of the sampled area. This species was amongst the species which less contributed to the total biomass and abundance of the pelagic species assemblage, with almost 3 thousand tonnes and 43 million fish only. Acoustic estimates for jack and <b>horse‐mackerel</b> species (Trachurus spp.), and bogue (Boops boops) are also given in the WD. No acoustic estimates either for mackerel S. scombrus or round sardinella (Sardinella aurita) were computed because their incidental occurrence or even absence in the study area during the survey. Because of the problems with the acoustic sampling coverage, results from this survey are not directly comparable with those provided by IPIMAR from its PELAGO 10 spring survey, although some inferences on the most recent trends in the population levels of the main species may still be raised.

40|$|This study {{explored}} possible factors {{linked to}} the instability of the stock biomass of Namibian horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis (Castelnau 1861) in recent years (2001 - 2007). The major focus of the analysis was the contrast of stock traits in years of low and high stock biomass, as perceived from research cruises performed annually between February and March. Stock traits analyzed included: recruitment and year class composition; spatial distribution of the stock; variations in fish body-mass condition and reflections on stock biomass; and maturation patterns and influences on spawning stock biomass. An additional analysis, also based on secondary data, explored the changes in effort capacity, activity and efficiency of the fishing fleet {{over a longer period}} of time. Fish 0 - 3 years old dominate the stock at present, and the modes of the fish size composition appeared to be fairly stable along the years. Thus, length-growth seemed to proceed unaffected by changes in stock biomass. There was, however, a marked affluence of pre-recruits in the years of high stock biomass. Thus, stock biomass was related to recruitment (measured as fish < 12 cm), which varied by a factor of 20 between the years of high and low stock biomass. Study of the fish allometry showed a trend of decreasing b (exponent) and increasing a (proportionality constant), and this trend seemed to be temporal rather than density-dependent. This seemingly resulted in better condition of the fish, and increased stock biomass by up to 14 %. Most of the fish during the survey period were found to be maturing. But, there was a strong declining trend in the calculated size at maturity, which did not seem to be immediately related to stock density. This resulted in a compensatory increase in the calculated spawning stock biomass with time. The spatial distribution of the stock has largely expanded after a reflux in 2002. This does not seem to be directly related to stock biomass, and may conceal migratory fluxes to/from a southern stock. The fishing fleets may have become more efficient at catching the fish, as the reduction in the fishing capacity is not reflected in the catches. Further, the nominal catch per unit effort showed stability and failed to reflect the decline in stock size, particularly in the last years of the series. The surveys seem to underestimate the occurrence of bigger sized fish, as compared to the midwater trawler fleet that more efficiently target the spawning stock. Contrastingly, purse-seiners efficiently target 1 -year old fish. The catches of the different life-stages of <b>horse-mackerel</b> by both fleets seem to form a large phase-cycle that is partly conditioned by the occurrence of another species, the pilchard, and, thereby, by transference of effort of seiners between stocks. Rather than a single-species approach, a more strategic approach to management would probably be to consider a fishery system composed by two-prey and two-competing fleets, linked by strong economic and technological interactions...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{investigation}} of eighteen Neomeris phocaenoides CUVIER which had beed caught in the coast of Tachibana Bay and landed at Nagasaki fish-market, the following characteristics have been ascertained. 1. The body color of this species is, in general, silver-grey, but is slightly light in its color in the part {{from the front of the}} larynx nearly to the anus. Their body color is usually changed to black, when it is made into sample by the fixation or left as it is. Therefore it has been mistakenly reported since olden time that the fresh body color of this species is black. 2. The head of this species is smaller than that of other species, with no snout. The forehead part and upper lip are similar to those of Globicephala melaena. And this whale has no dorsal fin but has a rising growing in wide line at the back, in exchange for the dorsal fin, and many little dots are found in that rising. The histological section of the rising, through the epidermal dot, is shown in Plate IN- 15. 3. The percentage of the fins to the body length in this species is larger than that of other species; and the posterior margin of the pectoral fin does not take the wave from. 4. In other kinds of the little toothed whales, the growth of body length is believed to be almost due to the growth of the tail part of such whales as Tursiops sp. and Pseudorca sp., but the growth of the body-length of this species is due to the growth of the abdominal part. 5. To speak of the skull of this species, the extreme rising at the fore part of the nares on os incisivum is characteristic, while os pterygoides, when viewed from the palate, is complicated. The skull measurement of this species are shown in Table 2. 6. The number of vertebra is shown in Table 3. Of the cervical vertebrae, 1 st. - 3 rd. adhere to all specimens. ﻿ 7. The number of os costale, two-headed os costale, and cartilago, and their connection to vertebrae and sternum are shown in Table 4 and Fig. 5. 8. The form of sternum is interesting to see. It is a short, wide and single bone, and does not consist of three bones, quite different from that of other kinds the of little toothed whales. 9. The scapula of this species has a characteristic form. It is considered generally that the scapula of the little toothed whales is characteristic in form according to their kinds. 10. The number and the form of teeth is shown in Table 5, Fig. 6 and Plate III- 10, 12. The form and arrangement of teeth in this species is very characteristic. 11. It seems that Neomeris phocaenoides is delivered of its cub in the coast of Nagasaki Prefecture between the last ten days of August and the first of September. This toothed whale takes the small sardin, small <b>horse-mackerel,</b> squid and other coastal little fishes, namely it has omnivorous nature. 12. In the case of male, there is no mammary slit on both side of the reproductive aperture, and there is a little cavity between the anus and reproductive aperture as shown in Plate II- 8. This is the vestige of teat. 13. The authors regret that they can not find the values of this species caught in other sea areas, and confirmed by other authors in regard to the external proportions, the skull measurment, the number of vertebra, os costale, cartilago costale and the teeth, as there is scarcely any such trustworthy values of measurment to be relied upon. 1963 年 9 月・ 10 月,長崎県橘湾沿岸で捕獲され,長崎魚市に水揚げされたスナメリ(Neomeris phocaenoides CUVIER) の内 18 頭(雄 12 頭,雌 6 頭) について諸観察測定を行い,本種の特徴について検討した結果,次の事が明らかになった, 1. 本種の体色は,下吻下面より肛門附近までは幾分淡色をなしているが,大体に於て全身銀灰色である. 固定液で標本にした場合や,そのまゝ長く放置した場合には,普通体色は黒変する. 昔から本種の体色は黒色であると報ぜられているのは,この為であろう. 2. 本種の頭部は他に比べて非常に小さい. 又吻は突出していなくて前頭部及び上唇部はGlobicephala melaenaに良く似ている. 又本種には背鰭がない. その代りに背部に隆起部が巾広帯い状に発達していて,その隆起部には細い突起が多数存在している. その突起の部分を通る隆起部の組織学的な切片の状態はP 1. IV- 15 に示した. 3. 本種の鰭の体長比は他の種類の小型歯鯨よりも大きい. 特に胸鰭はその傾向が強い. 又胸鰭後縁は波状をなしていない. 4. 他の種類の小型歯鯨類ではその体長の成長は主としてその尾部による所が大であったが,本種に於ける体長の成長はその胴部の伸びが主として貢献している. これは本種が沿岸性の小型歯鯨である事を物語っていると思われる. 5. 本種の頭骨には切歯骨の鼻孔前方に存在する甚しい隆起が特徴的であり,その他形態上の特徴は口蓋面より見た翼状骨の形が複雑である等. 又本種の頭骨計測結果はTable 2 に示した. 6. 脊椎骨数の計測結果はTable 3 にかゝげた. 本種の頸椎骨は大体に於て最初の三つが癒着していた. 7. 肋骨・肋軟骨数及び夫等と脊椎骨・胸骨との結合状態等についてはTable 4,Fig. 5 に示した. 8. 本種の胸骨は非常に特徴ある形態をして居り,他の種類の小型歯鯨類の胸骨に於ける如く,胸骨柄・胸骨体・剣状突起の三つの骨から成立っていなくて単一骨である. その長さは短くて,巾広い. 9. 本種の肩甲骨は特徴ある形をしている. 肩甲骨は各種の小型歯鯨でその形態に良く特徴が出ていると思われる. 10. 本種の歯数はTable 5 に示した. 本種の歯の形及び歯の配列状態は特徴的である. 11. 本極は長崎県沿岸では 8 月下旬より 9 月初旬に分娩するものと思われる. 又本種は雑食性で沿岸の小型魚例えば小アジ・小イワシ及びイカ類を餌として摂取している様である. 12. 本種の雄には生殖孔の両側に乳溝はない. 又生殖孔と肛門の中間に一つの小盲嚢が存在している. これは退化乳頭であると考えられる. 13. 他に信頼出来る測定値が殆んどないので,体長プロポーション・頭骨計測・脊椎骨数・肋骨・肋軟骨・歯数・等他の海域産のものと比較出来ないのは残念であった...|$|E
