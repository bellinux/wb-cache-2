The differential aerosol sizing and hygroscopicity spectrometer probe (DASH-SP) employs differential mobility analysis in-concert with multiple humidification and optical sizing steps to determine dry optical size and hygroscopic growth factors for size-selected aerosols simultaneously at three elevated relative humidities. The DASH-SP has been designed especially for aircraft-based measurements, with time resolution as short as a few seconds. The minimum particle diameter detected with 50 % efficiency in the optical particle counters (OPCs) is 135 ± 8 nm, while the maximum detectable particle diameter is in excess of 1 μm. An iterative data processing algorithm quantifies growth factors and “effective” refractive indices for humidified particles using an empirically derived three-dimensional surface (OPC pulse height–refractive index–particle size), based on a calculated value of the “effective” dry particle refractive index. Excellent agreement is obtained between DASH-SP laboratory data and thermodynamic model predictions for growth factor dependence on relative humidity for various inorganic salts.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{seasonal}} variability of atmospheric abundances of dicarboxylic acids, oxocarboxylic acids, and -dicarbonyls over the North Pacific and Sea of Japan, aerosol samples were collected along the longitudinal transacts during six cruises between Canada and Japan. The back trajectory analyses indicate that aerosol samples collected in winter and spring {{are influenced by the}} East Asian outflow, whereas summer and fall samples are associated with the pristine maritime air masses. Molecular distributions of water-soluble organics in winter and spring samples show the predominance of oxalic acid (C- 2) followed by succinic (C- 4) and malonic acids (C- 3). In contrast, summer and fall marine aerosols are characterized by the predominance of C- 3 over C- 4. Concentrations of dicarboxylic acids were higher over the Sea of Japan than the North Pacific. With a lack of continental outflow, higher concentrations during early summer are ascribed to atmospheric oxidation of organic precursors associated with high biological activity in the North Pacific. This interpretation is further supported by the high abundances of azelaic acid, which is a photochemical oxidation product of biogenic unsaturated fatty acids, over the Bering Sea in early summer when surface waters are characterized by high biological productivity. We found higher ratios of oxalic acid to pyruvic and <b>glyoxylic</b> <b>acids</b> (C- 2 /Pyr and C- 2 /C- 2) and glyoxal and methylglyoxal (C- 2 /Gly and C- 2 /MeGly) in summer and fall than in winter and spring, suggesting a production of C- 2 from the aqueous-phase oxidation of oceanic isoprene.

Homologous series of dicarboxylic acids (C 2 –C 11 ) and related compounds (ketocarboxylic acids and dicarbonyls) were identified using gas chromatography and GC/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Among the species detected, oxalic acid was found to be the most abundant, followed by succinic, malonic and <b>glyoxylic</b> <b>acids.</b> Average concentrations of total dicarboxylic acids, ketocarboxylic acids and α-dicarbonyls in the aerosol samples were 2180, 167 and 56 ng m&minus; 3 , respectively. These are 2 – 8, 3 – 11 and 2 – 16 times higher, respectively, than those reported in urban aerosols, such as in 14 Chinese megacities. Higher ratios of dicarboxylic acids and related compounds to biomass burning tracers (levoglucosan and K+) were found in the daytime than in the nighttime, suggesting an importance of photochemical production. On the other hand, higher ratios of oxalic acid to other dicarboxylic acids and related compounds normalized to biomass burning tracers (levoglucosan and K+) in the daytime provide evidence for the possible degradation of dicarboxylic acids (&ge;C 3 ) in this smoke-polluted environment. Assuming that these and related compounds are photochemically oxidized to oxalic acid in the daytime and given their linear relationship, they could account for, on average, 77 % of the formation of oxalic acid.

The annual volume-weighted concentrations of organic acids in order of decreasing abundance in rainwater was formic (9. 9 μM), acetic (7. 3 μM), oxalic (1. 8 μM), lactic (1. 3 μM), succinic (1. 0 μM), malonic (0. 7 μM), pyruvic (0. 3 μM), and maleic (0. 1 μM), with methanesulfonic and <b>glyoxylic</b> <b>acids</b> usually below their detection limit. Growing season back-trajectory data provided strong evidence that terrestrial organic acid sources dominated over marine sources. Air mass back-trajectory analysis indicated that {{during the growing season}} air mass origin had a consistent impact on concentrations of rainwater organic acids. Rain with continental back-trajectories coming from the west had the highest concentrations of organic acids while two predominately marine back-trajectories had the lowest concentrations. Concentrations of organic acids in non-growing season rain did not display a consistent pattern indicating variability in sources. Seasonality of individual organic acids for specific back-trajectories was most pronounced in terrestrial back-trajectories and least in the marine back-trajectories indicating that seasonality in rainwater organic acid concentrations is driven by variations in terrestrial sources. Formic to acetic acid ratios (F:A), previously an indicator of terrestrial versus marine sources of these organic acids, were similar for all back-trajectories reflecting anthropogenic impacts on F:A locally and regionally. The ratios of malonic to succinic acids (M:S), also an indicator of sources for these acids, indicated direct anthropogenic sources for terrestrial back-trajectories and secondary processes for marine back-trajectories. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Similarly, homologous series of straight chain fatty acids (C 12 : 0 - C 30 : 0) has beendetected by using GC/FID and GC/MS system.

Molecular distributions of ω-oxocarboxylic acids {{are characterized by}} thepredominance of 9 -oxononanoic, followed by 4 -oxobutanoic and <b>glyoxylic</b> <b>acids.</b> Historical concentrations of diacids, oxoacids and α-dicarbonyls are formed by theoxidation of precursor compounds emitted from biogenic and biomass burningactivities and which are controlled under climate oscillations and similarmeteorological parameters.

Molecular distributions of fatty acids are characterized by even carbon numberpredominance with a peak at palmitic (C 16 : 0) followed by oleic (C 18 : 1) and myristicacid (C 14 : 0). The historical trends of short-chain fatty acids, together with correlationanalysis with inorganic ions and organic tracers suggest that short-chain fatty acids(except for C 12 : 0 and C 15 : 0) were mainly derived from sea surface micro layers. Incontrast, long-chain fatty acids (C 20 : 0 - C 30 : 0) are originated from terrestrial higherplants, soil organic matter and dusts, which are also linked with GreenlandTemperature Anomaly (GTA). Hence, {{this study suggests that}} Alaskan fatty acids arestrongly influenced by Pacific Decadal Oscillation/North Pacific Gyre Oscillationand/or extra tropical North Pacific surface climate and Arctic Oscillation.

Moreover, there are a few discrepancies of higher spikes among them after 1980 s with sporadic peaks in 1994 - 2007 fordehydroabietic acid. Historical trends of levoglucosan, dehydroabietic and vanillicacid showed that biomass burning activities from resin and lignin phenols from borealconifer trees and other higher plants and grasses were significant before 1840 s andafter 1980 s in the source regions of southern Alaska. Nitrite (NO 2 -), nitrate (NO 3 -), sulfate (SO 42 -) and methanesulfonate (CH 3 SO 3 -) were determined for an ice core of the Aurora Peak in southeast Alaska using ionchromatograph. They have common periods for higher spike during the years 1665 - 2008. They are attributed to the same source regions and similar pathways. Interestingly, we found multi-decadal scale atmospheric transport from lower tohigher latitudes in the North Pacific, which is reflected in historical concentrationtrends of anions.

In the deep-litter method of poultry husbandry the uric acid of the droppings rapidly disappears from the litter and there is often a marked evolution of ammonia.

Subsequently, the boronic acid is added to the mixture and product is generated, either after 30 minutes at 90 °C, or after several hours at 25 °C.

Multi-component reaction is a chemical reaction, in which three or more starting materials react to form the product in an atom economy manner and ease of access to complex molecules in one-pot certainly belong to this class. A contemporary challenge {{in the world is}} environmental pollution. Multi component reactions are certainly one of the solutions for this problem due to the less release of chemical wastage compared with classical bicomponent reaction protocols and it is being considered as one of the green technology. I have also tried to use water as a reaction solvent to synthesize heterocyclic compounds because water is cheaper, green solvent and highly abundant in nature. I have synthesized various valuable heterocyclic compounds using multicomponent reactions. Compounds possessing pyrrolo[2, 3 -c]pyridone backbone have been used to control the cell proliferation in breast cancer and p 38 kinase inhibitors. Wang Le et. al., also have reported molecules having pyrrolo[2, 3 -c]pyridone backbone as BRD 4 receptor inhibitors to control breast cancer. Considering the importance of these molecules, we have demonstrated an efficient, mild and multicomponent protocol for the synthesis of novel heterocyclic compounds possessing pyrrolo[2, 3 -c]pyridone backbone by using Ugi four component reaction and post condensation of Ugi adduct. This method offers several advantages such as easy handling procedure, atom economy, short reaction time and huge molecular library can be synthesized by changing the substituents on four independent starting materials. In previous reported methods for pyrrolo[2, 3 - c]pyridones, expensive metal catalysts were used, where as in present method we used inexpensive PTSA catalyst. Various anilines substituted with Iodo, bromo, chloro, methyl, methoxy at different positions on aniline were used in Ugi 4 CR. And also phenyl <b>glyoxylic</b> <b>acids</b> substituted with methoxy, ethoxy, methyl and chloro were used in combinations with t-butyl and cyclohexyl isocyanides. In all cases the reaction proceeded smoothly and yielded the corresponding pyrrolo[2, 3 -c]pyridone derivatives in good to excellent yields. Considering these advantages we hope this methodology will be useful for medicinal chemists in drug discovery process. All the products were characterized by using NMR (1 H and 13 C) spectroscopy and FAB mass. One of the products was further characterized with X-ray diffraction analysis. Coumarin analogs having both coumarin and furan heterocycles have gained the considerable attention of researchers due to their significant properties as anti-leishmania panamensis, dyes and fluorescent sensors. Coumarin analogs with furan heterocycle isolated from the plants origin such as microminutin, micromelin, psoralen, 8 -methoxypsoralen have important properties in medicinal chemistry and bio photochemistry. It is well documented that by introducing a heteroaromatic substituent at 3 -position the absorption and emission maxima of coumarin scaffold can be improved because of extended πconjugation and consequently their optoelectronic properties can be improved. Based on this phenomenon a variety of 3 -heteroaryl coumarin derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated for their optoelectronic properties. Considering the broad range of applications of furyl coumarin derivatives, we have demonistrated an efficient and facile synthesis of 3 -furyl coumarin derivatives by reaction of 4 - chloro- 3 -formylcoumarin, secondary amines, dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylates and diversely substituted isocyanides using four component one pot reaction. All the products were isolated as yellow color fluorescent solids by column chromatography in quantitative yield and characterized with 1 H NMR, C 13 NMR, IR and FAB mass. Spiro compounds having dipyrrole namely Amathaspiramide A, Mytraginine psuedoindoxyl as shown below was proven to have prominent antiviral and anticancer properties. Very few reports were there in the literature for the synthesis of spiro [indole- 2, 2 ’- pyrroles] bearing spiro carbon at C- 2 position. Considering this as an opportunity, we have developed an efficient and facile method for the synthesis of novel spiro[indole- 2, 22 ̆ 7 -pyrroles] from N-methyl- 3 -isatin imines, t-butyl isocyanide and dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylate has been achieved by [3 + 2] cyclo addition reaction. The notable advantages of this protocol are operational simplicity, easily available starting materials, available diversity of each component, catalyst free and easy work procedure employed. We believed in this protocol will help in developing novel spiro heterocyclic compounds using C- 2 carbon atom of isatin. All the products were purified by column chromatography as yellow solids and confirmed with 1 H NMR, 13 CNMR, FAB mass, IR. One of the compound was further confirmed with X-ray analysis. Imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridines have been valuable to organic and medicinal chemists due to the interesting structure and numerous applications in pharmaceutical Industry. The molecules possessing imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridine core structure have been used as anticancer, antiinflammatory, antibacterial, antiprotozonal and antiviral agents. Additionally, they were also used for the treatment of gastric disease and heart disease. They have been found in drug candidates such as Minodronic acid used for the treatment of osteoporosis, Zolpidem used for the treatment of insomnia and some brain disorders, Zolmidine used for the treatment of peptic ulcers and gastro esophageal reflux disease and Olprinone used for the treatment of acute heart failure. Considering these applications, New coumarin derivatives having imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridine heterocycle moiety were synthesized by the condensation of 4 -morpholino- 3 -formyl coumarin, diversely substituted 2 -amino pyridine and isocyanides under catalyst free, water mediated reaction conditions. All the products were characterized by using IR, NMR (1 H and 13 C) spectroscopy and HRMS spectrometry. Product 4 b was further characterized with X-ray diffraction analysis. All the products have showed UV-Visible absorbance in between 234 nm to 248 nm and emissions were observed in between 412 nm to 544 nm. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:工博甲第 436 号 学位授与年月日:平成 29 年 3 月 24 日 1.

40|$|Organic aerosols, as an {{important}} fraction of airborne particulate mass, significantly affect the environment, climate, and human health. Compared with inorganic species, characterization of individual organic compounds is much less complete and comprehensive because they number in thousands or more and are diverse in chemical structures. The source contributions of organic aerosols are far from being well understood {{because they can be}} emitted {{from a variety of sources}} as well as formed from photochemical reactions of numerous precursors. This thesis work aims to improve the characterization of polar organic compounds and source apportionment analysis of fine organic carbon (OC) in Hong Kong, which consists of two parts: 1. An improved analytical method to determine monocarboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acids, ketocarboxylic acids, and dicarbonyls collected on filter substrates has been established. These oxygenated compounds were determined as their butyl ester or butyl acetal derivatives using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The new method made improvements over the original Kawamura method by eliminating the water extraction and evaporation steps. Aerosol materials were directly mixed with the BF 3 /BuOH derivatization agent and the extracting solvent hexane. This modification improves recoveries for both the more volatile and the less water-soluble compounds. This improved method was applied to study the abundances and sources of these oxygenated compounds in PM 2. 5 aerosol samples collected in Hong Kong under different synoptic conditions during 2003 - 2005. These compounds account for on average 5. 2 % of OC (range: 1. 4 %- 13. 6 %) on a carbon basis. Oxalic acid was the most abundant species. Six C 2 and C 3 oxygenated compounds, namely oxalic, malonic, <b>glyoxylic,</b> pyruvic <b>acids,</b> glyoxal, and methylglyoxal, dominated this suite of oxygenated compounds. More efforts are therefore suggested to focus on these small compounds in understanding the role of oxygenated compounds in aerosol chemistry and physics. By reference to tracers for the major organic aerosol sources, it is deduced that the oxygenated compounds are mainly of secondary origin and direct/indirect contribution from biomass burning could also be important. The chemical composition of these oxygenated species in PM 2. 5 samples in Hong Kong provide useful information to further ambient and model study in the aspects of chemical formation pathways and speciated organic mass distribution. 2. Source apportionment of PM 2. 5 organic aerosols in Hong Kong were carried out in two studies. In the first study, chemical characterization and source analysis involved samples collected on high particulate matter (PM) days (avg. PM 2. 5 > 84 μg m- 3) at six general stations and one roadside station from October to December in 2003. Analysis of synoptic weather conditions identified three types of high PM episodes: local, regional transport (RT) and long-range transport (LRT). Roadside samples were discussed separately. Using chemical mass balance (CMB) model, contributions of major primary sources (vehicle exhaust, cooking, biomass burning, cigarette smoke, vegetative detritus, and coal combustion) were estimated, which indicate that vehicle exhaust was the most important primary source, followed by cooking and biomass burning. All primary sources except vegetative detritus had the highest contributions at roadside station, in line with its site characteristics. Primary sources dominated roadside and local samples (> 64 % of fine OC), while un-apportioned OC (i. e., the difference between measured OC and apportioned primary OC) dominated RT and LRT episodes (> 60 % of fine OC) and un-apportioned OC had characteristics of secondary OC. In the second study, cold front episodes during winter 2004 and 2005 were targeted to investigate the effect of cold front-related LRT on chemical characteristics and organic aerosol sources of PM 2. 5 in Hong Kong. In comparison with days under influences of mainly local emissions or RT, cold front LRT brought more organic aerosols attributable to coal combustion and biomass burning. Both cold front episodes and RT brought in significant amount of secondary OC to Hong Kong. The relative abundances of major aerosol constituents (sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, organic matter, and elemental carbon) were similar in cold front periods and RT-dominated periods...|$|R
