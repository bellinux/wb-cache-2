40|$|Hammadah al Hamra 126 (HAH 126) {{is a new}} ureilite {{recovered}} from the Sahara desert in 1995. This meteorite experienced fairly extensive weathering in the desert environment. Olivines in HAH 126 are more <b>intensely</b> <b>reduced</b> than those in other ureilites which have been studied to date. We have obtained a cooling rate of 0. 1 - 0. 7 ℃/hour for the reduction rims of olivines using diffusion calculations. This cooling rate is slightly slower than those for other ureilites. Rims of pigeonite grains in HAH 126 often show high-Ca contents. These Ca-rich materials resemble those which are present at olivine rims in Y- 74123 ureilite. This fact suggests that Ca-rich melt was present at grain boundaries (H. OGATa et al.; Meteoritics, 25, 195, 1991) ...|$|R

The third objective involves a comparison of the mineral chemistries of decomposed olivine with unaltered olivine in an attempt to determine the temperature limits. The sample was selected because {{it is one of the}} most <b>intensely</b> <b>reduced</b> samples returned from the moon.

The most important requirements of this project were to build a customized, lightweight and low cost robot, capable to fulfil many industrial working tasks such as palletizing mobile telephone covers. For designing and optimizing the mechanical structure of the palletizing robot a SolidWorks- software was used. Integrating motion simulation tools in SolidWorks <b>intensely</b> <b>reduces</b> the engineering time for finding the optimal mechanical structure of the robot according to the industrial task. The robot parts are produced by using the additive manufacturing technology- powder material PA 2200. For solving the forward and inverse kinematics of the robot, the Software tool SimMechanics from MathWorks was used. This environment provided by the software enables building a human machine interface in order to store and program the robot targets.

This study aimed to quantify runoff velocity and concentration and the D 50 index of sediments in runoff under different soil surface managements, in the following treatments: i) cropped systems: no-tilled soil covered by ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) residue, with high soil cover and minimal roughness (HCR); no tilled soil covered by vetch (Vicia sativa L.) residue, with high soil cover and minimal roughness (HCV); chiseled soil after ryegrass crop removing the above-ground residues and keeping only the root system, with high roughness (HRR); chiseled soil after vetch crop removing the above-ground residues and keeping only the root system, with high roughness (HRV); ii) bare and chiseled soil, with high roughness (BHR). The research was conducted on a Humic Dystrupept under simulated rainfall. The design was completely randomized and each treatment was replicated twice. Eight rainfall events of controlled intensity (65 mm h− 1) were applied to each treatment for 90 minutes. The D 50 index, runoff velocity and sediment concentration were influenced by crop and soil management. Runoff velocity was more <b>intensely</b> <b>reduced</b> by cover crop residues than by surface roughness. Regardless of surface condition, the D 50 index and concentration of sediment in runoff were lower under ryegrass than vetch crop. Runoff velocity and the D 50 index were exponentially and inversely correlated with soil cover by residues and with surface roughness, while the D 50 index was positively and exponentially correlated with runoff velocity...|$|R
