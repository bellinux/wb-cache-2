500|$|EastEnders has {{received}} {{praise for the}} handling of Peggy's breast cancer storyline, as she was a rare media portrayal of an older matriarchal woman with the disease. Older women are at higher risk of being diagnosed; however, in 2001, {{it was reported that}} media representation of breast cancer is skewed towards younger women in their 20s or 30s, as they are seen as [...] "more tragic" [...] or [...] "more sexy" [...] in media terms. A 2000 study by Kitzinger and Henderson showed that 94% of newspaper coverage on non-celebrity women with breast cancer was on those aged under 50. Source organisations working with EastEnders on the storyline have commented: [...] " [...] decided {{it was going to be}} [...] and very rightly so. Bang on, the right age [...] perfect dramatic licence in terms of her sons that she was going to have to share this terrible news with, and <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> share it? Every female would have that problem. How would you tell your children? And they followed that with her. She was exactly the right person." [...] The storyline also received media criticism, for the use of a breast care nurse, who was used to counsel Peggy and translate medical terminology into lay terms for viewers; a character who could provide both a dramatic and educational purpose. However, not all oncology units in the UK offer breast care nurses, and the character presented [...] "particularly positive messages" [...] concerning patient choice and control over treatment options. Because of this, the UK press dubbed the storyline [...] "didactic". The storyline was also criticised because Peggy received her cancer test results after six days, which prompted cancer charities to warn that not all patients would receive the same treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after The News of the World story broke, rival tabloid the Daily Star {{ran a story}} alleging Archer {{had paid}} for sex with Coghlan, {{something}} The News of the World had been careful to avoid stating directly. Archer responded by suing the Daily Star. The case came to court in July 1987. Explaining the payment to Coghlan as the action of a philanthropist rather {{than that of a}} guilty man, Archer won the case and was awarded Â£500,000 damages. Archer stated he would donate the money to charity. However, this case would ultimately result in Archer's final exit from front-line politics some years later. The description the judge (Mr Justice Caulfield) gave of Mrs Archer in his jury instructions included: [...] "Remember Mary Archer in the witness-box. Your vision of her probably will never disappear. Has she elegance? Has she fragrance? Would she have, without the strain of this trial, radiance? <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> appeal? Has she had a happy married life? Has she been able to enjoy, rather than endure, her husband Jeffrey?" [...] The judge then went on to say of Jeffrey Archer, [...] "Is he in need of cold, unloving, rubber-insulated sex in a seedy hotel round about quarter to one on a Tuesday morning after an evening at the Caprice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{first thought}} was <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> return again, when the {{darkness}} was begun, but her only answer was, 'Heed not that! My child, I must see.' ...|$|E
60|$|He gave at {{this the}} quickest shake to his foot. <b>How</b> far <b>would</b> <b>she</b> go in HER notion of it.|$|R
60|$|As {{he covered}} mile after mile, through woods and over {{stretches}} of broad prairie, {{he could not}} help but think of his racing mare, Bonnie Bird. <b>How</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have enjoyed this outing, and <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have covered this ground with her twinkling feet.|$|R
6000|$|But {{she could}} not marry him. And it was expected, nay, almost {{necessary}} that she should marry someone. To that someone, <b>how</b> good <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be! <b>How</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> strive by duty and attention, and if possible by affection, {{to make up for}} that misfortune of her early love! ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{she drove}} on through Blackmoor Vale, and the {{landscape}} of her youth began to open around her, Tess aroused herself from her stupor. Her first thought was <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> be able to face her parents? ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{remember}} how I handled and scrutinized that letter, seeking for some intimation that our former intimacy was still alive. We were to meet. How should we meet? <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> look at me? What would she think of me? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> look? Would {{her face}} have that oldtime peachy bloom, her mouth that {{peculiar}} beautiful curve? She {{was large and}} fair, he recalled, hair yellow and shining, eyes blue-He roused himself. This was nonsense! He was trembling. He composed himself by looking around again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] said Staniford, with sincere humility. He {{understood}} {{how she had}} had this in her mind, and <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not withhold justice from him because he had fallen in her esteem; <b>how</b> rather <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be the more resolute to do him justice for that reason.|$|R
60|$|Lastly, {{she pictured}} to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> gather about her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps {{even with the}} dream of Wonderland of long ago: and <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a {{pleasure}} in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.|$|R
60|$|He {{watched her}} to see <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> receive this, but she laughed.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly I {{was filled}} with the thought of her and a great longing for her. What would she do when she {{realised}} our immense disaster? What would she do? <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> take it? It filled me with astonishment to realise how little I could tell....|$|E
6000|$|Marilla {{had seen}} Anne start {{off to school}} {{on the first day}} of September with many secret misgivings.

6000|$|BIGELOW--How can {{you keep}} repeating that--with Martha hardly cold in her grave! I ask you again, what would she think, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> feel--If you would only consent to see this baby, I know you'd realize how damnably mad and cruel you are. Won't you--just for a second? ...|$|E
60|$|Then she thought, (in a dream {{within the}} dream, as it were,) how this same little Alice would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman: and <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> keep, through her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> gather around her other little children, {{and make their}} eyes bright and eager with many a {{wonderful}} tale, perhaps even with these very adventures of the little Alice of long-ago: and <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.|$|R
60|$|That Mrs. Sanderson was selfish, worldly, and {{at times}} mercenary, I well knew. However, these very {{attributes}} led {{me to believe that}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> gratify herself and her son. I knew <b>how</b> thoroughly <b>she</b> <b>would</b> enjoy the absolute control of Mariposilla, <b>how</b> extravagantly <b>she</b> <b>would</b> equip her with the elegancies of life, exulting that Sidney's wife eclipsed always the beauty of other women.|$|R
6000|$|Vent. See now {{the effects}} of her so boasted love! She strives to drag you down to ruin with her; But, could she 'scape without you, oh <b>how</b> soon <b>Would</b> <b>she</b> let go her hold, and haste to shore, And never look behind! ...|$|R
60|$|Whilst she {{remained}} before the picture, wondering her favourite wonder, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> feel if this and its accompanying canvases were {{pictures of her}} own ancestors, she was surprised by a light footstep upon the carpet which covered part of the room, and turning quickly she beheld the smiling little figure of Charlotte De Stancy.|$|E
6000|$|<b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> seem {{to these}} two men down-stairs, she asked herself--the dour, grim master of the house, and her more {{youthful}} rescuer, whose coming had somehow touched her fancy? They saw so little of her sex. They seemed, in a sense, to be in league against it. Would they {{find out that they}} were entertaining an angel unawares? ...|$|E
6000|$|Elizabeth {{could not}} see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this time have been {{presented}} to her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been. [...] "What would she have said? <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> have behaved?" [...] were questions with which she amused herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Almia {{had never}} been so excited in her life; she could {{scarcely}} breathe. This was the grandeur of glorious war! Oh, <b>how</b> willingly <b>would</b> <b>she</b> have mounted a fleet steed and have followed those valiant horsemen as they thundered away into the distance!" ...|$|R
60|$|Rosamond sat {{perfectly}} still. The {{thought in}} her mind was {{that if she had}} known <b>how</b> Lydgate <b>would</b> behave, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never have married him.|$|R
60|$|Jess just looked, and all {{the women}} knew <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> take Jamie to her arms.|$|R
6000|$|This put {{a little}} {{resolution}} into his blood, and he dressed rapidly, with little thought on anything else. Once or twice he {{looked out at the}} misty blue hills, cool and fresh with recent rains. As the porter came to get his grip a few minutes later, Mason wondered how he should meet her, with a hand-shake or a kiss? <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> meet him? ...|$|E
60|$|Arnold {{could have}} desired no better {{opportunity}} {{than she had}} offered to him, in those words, for making the long-deferred disclosure to her of the truth. He lifted his eyes to Blanche's face. By an unhappy fatality she was looking charmingly that morning. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> look if he told her {{the story of the}} hiding at the inn? Arnold was still in love with her--and Arnold said nothing.|$|E
6000|$|MOUNTJOY {{had decided}} on {{travelling}} to Honeybuzzard, {{as soon as}} he heard that Miss Henley was staying with strangers in that town. Having had no earlier opportunity of preparing her to see him, he had considerately written to her from the inn, in preference to presenting himself unexpectedly at the doctor's house. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> receive the devoted friend, whose proposal of marriage she had refused for the second time, when they had last met in London? ...|$|E
50|$|When {{she was in}} the 6th grade she was {{featured}} in a TV show on the tallest Japanese young girls. She was 177 cm. When asked <b>how</b> tall <b>would</b> <b>she</b> like to be, her reply was 185 cm. She retired from the Toray Arrows in May 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Quigley Kim - Dr. Kim is an {{absent-minded}} entomologist who has {{a tendency}} to digress. She is working hard to gain fame and funding.

60|$|<b>How</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{work for}} that happiness! <b>How</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{appreciate}} it, {{make the most}} of each least particle of it! But how was she to do it. Where was the path? She could not vision it. Her eyes showed her only the smudge of San Francisco, the smudge of Oakland, where men were breaking heads and killing one another, where babies were dying, born and unborn, and where women were weeping with bruised breasts.|$|R
6000|$|Here was {{the place}} with red-striped awning, {{carriages}} driving away, loiterers watching. He turned in with a beating heart. Was he before her? <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> come to this first dance? With Oliver alone? Or had some chaperon been found? To have come because she--this child so lovely, born 'outside'--might have need of chaperonage, would have been some comfort to dignity, so wistful, so lost as his. But, alas! {{he knew he was}} only there because he could not keep away! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There, now I can't go, anyhow!' he said bitterly, jumping up, and picturing her {{receiving}} her company. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> look; {{what would}} she wear? Profoundly indifferent to {{the early history of}} the noble fabric, he felt a violent reaction towards modernism, eclecticism, new aristocracies, everything, in short, that Paula represented. He even gave himself up to consider the Greek court that she had wished for, and passed the remainder of the evening in making a perspective view of the same.|$|E
60|$|Was she {{grateful}} to him? No. Afraid of him? No. Scornful of him? Not quite. But {{she was afraid}} of HERSELF, horribly. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> ever be able to keep herself in hand, how disguise from these people that she loved their boy? It was her desperate mood that she feared. But since she so much wanted all the best for him that life could give, surely she would have the strength to do nothing that might harm him. Yet she was afraid.|$|E
60|$|Poor Kate! she {{little thought}} how weak her {{consolation}} was, and <b>how</b> soon <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be undeceived.|$|R
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{ever have}} got them through {{that last week}} is very uncertain, if a providential picnic had not helped her.|$|R
6000|$|Clara, of course, did {{answer the}} letter; but she wrote her answer to Mary, sending, however, one little scrap to Mary's brother. She wrote to Mary at great length, striving to explain, with long and {{laborious}} arguments, {{that it was}} quite impossible that she should accept the Belton estate from her cousin. That subject, however, and the manner of her future life, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> discuss with her dear cousin Mary, when Mary should have arrived. And then Clara said <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> go to Taunton to meet her cousin, and <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> prepare William's house for the reception of William's sister; and <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> love her cousin when she should come to know her. All of which was exceedingly proper and pretty. Then {{there was a little}} postscript, [...] "Give the enclosed to William." [...] And this was the note to William:-- ...|$|R
