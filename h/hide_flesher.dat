50|$|Toxic {{poultry feed}} {{contaminated}} by chromium-based leather tanning (as opposed to traditional slower vegetable tanning) is entering {{the food supply}} in Bangladesh through chicken meat, {{which is the most}} common source of protein in the country. Tanneries in Hazaribagh Thana, an industrial neighborhood of Dhaka, emit around 21,600 cubic meters of toxic waste each day. The tanneries also generate as much as 100 tonnes per day of scraps, trimmed raw <b>hide,</b> <b>flesh</b> and fat, which are processed into feed by neighborhood recycling plants and used in chicken and fish farms across the country. Chromium levels ranging from 350 to 4,520 micrograms (0.35 to 4.52 mg) per kilogram were found in different organs of chickens which had been fed the tannery-scraps feed for two months, according to Abul Hossain, a chemistry professor at the University of Dhaka. The study estimated up to 25% of the chickens in Bangladesh contained harmful levels of chromium(VI).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The meat portion {{directly}} {{attached to}} bovine <b>hides</b> (<b>fleshing</b> meat) is {{a by-product of}} leather industry that is a potential new source of proteins. In literature different enzymatic and chemical methods have been proposed to hydrolyze and solubilize fleshing meat. Enzyme hydrolysis is preferable for the mildness and the lower environmental impact. Enzymatic hydrolysates have never been deeply characterized, nor the specific enzyme efficiency, deeply investigated. In this study, the activity of six proteolytic enzymes was tested {{in order to determine}} their efficiency in solubilizing fleshing meat and to characterize at the molecular level the composition of the nitrogen fraction of the obtained hydrolysates. Total nitrogen content and the degree of hydrolysis were determined by Kjeldhal and o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) methods. Amino acids and peptides were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry techniques. The results showed that papain and Alcalase appear to be the most efficient enzymes, and the corresponding hydrolyzates were rich in peptides and amino acids characteristic of collagen, notably absent in the hydrolyzates obtained with other enzymes. Thus, the ability to efficiently hydrolyze collagen seems {{to be related to the}} efficiency in fleshing meat hydrolysis. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext. ]</p...|$|R

5000|$|Spondias tuberosa, {{commonly}} known as umbu/imbu, , [...] Brazil plum, or umbu, is native to northeast Brazil, where it grows in the Caatinga, the chaparral scrub that grows wild across dry lands of the Sertão. The round fruit is light yellow to red in colour, around 2-4 cm in size, and has a leathery shell. The flesh is soft and juicy, with a sweet taste and distinct aroma. The fruit comes from a small tree, seldom higher than 6 m, with an expansive crown of up to 10 m in diameter. The fruit of the imbu are round and can be of varying size: they can be as small as cherries or as large as lemons. The peel is smooth and green or yellow when the fruit ripen, the small firm fruits are juicy and flavorful and their succulent <b>flesh</b> <b>hides</b> a large dark pit.|$|R
50|$|Comanche {{people took}} pride in their hair, which was worn long and rarely cut. They {{arranged}} their hair with porcupine quill brushes, greased it and parted it in the center from the forehead {{to the back of}} the neck. They painted the scalp along the parting with yellow, red, or white clay (or other colors). They wore their hair in two long braids tied with leather thongs or colored cloth, and sometimes wrapped with beaver fur. They also braided a strand of hair from the top of their head. This slender braid, called a scalp lock, was decorated with colored scraps of cloth and beads, and a single feather. Comanche men rarely wore anything on their heads. Only after they moved onto a reservation late in the 19th century did Comanche men begin to wear the typical Plains headdress. If the winter was severely cold, they might wear a brimless, woolly buffalo hide hat. When they went to war, some warriors wore a headdress made from a buffalo's scalp. Warriors cut away most of the <b>hide</b> and <b>flesh</b> from a buffalo head, leaving only a portion of the woolly hair and the horns. This type of woolly, horned buffalo hat was worn only by the Comanche. Comanche women did not let their hair grow as long as the men did. Young women might wear their hair long and braided, but women parted their hair in the middle and kept it short. Like the men, they painted their scalp along the parting with bright paint.|$|R
40|$|Veddas are {{considered}} to be the indigenous people of Sri Lanka. A century ago, the Veddas were scattered across the Eastern Province, and some parts of the North-Central and Uva Provinces, although at present they are confined to Bintanne that stretches to some parts of the Uva and Eastern provinces. This paper explores the subsistence pattern of the Veddas in Sri Lanka in relation to their old equipment and practices. It builds on ethno-archaeological interpretations drawing from archaeological evidence from Prehistoric to Historical periods. Evidence of interaction of humans, technology,faunal and floral resources found from archaeological sites in relation to subsistence was interpreted through the method of ethnographic analogy. Evidence suggests that during the historical period, the Veddas lived in various parts of Sri Lanka including Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Ratnapura, Buttala, Tambalagam pattu, Kattakulam pattu, Bintannae, Nilgala and Batticaloa. They bartered deer <b>hide,</b> dried <b>flesh,</b> cotton and honey for rice, Kurrakkan (Elusine coracana), tobacco, salt, clothes and iron arrow heads a century ago. The existence of charred bones and arrow head type of bone tools shows the practice of hunting during the protohistoric and early historic periods. The Veddas did not adopt Sinhalese mode of life up till the 19 th century. However, acculturation is gradually taking place at least in the lifestyle of Veddas in Dambana at present. Especially the Anuradhapura Veddas who lived outside the Bintanne area do not seem to possess traditional Vedda livelihoods, and maintain a lifestyle comparable with the Sinhalese Buddhist culture. Based on the above evidence, the paper concludes that the subsistence patterns of Veddas prior to the last century are quite comparable with similar evidence found from the Mesolithic, Proto and the Early Historic periods in Sri Lanka, though a certain decline in the distinction between Vedda culture and the dominant culture may at present be observed. *...|$|R
5000|$|Near {{the end of}} the 2nd century, Melito of Sardis (whom Catholics {{and others}} {{consider}} to be a saint) wrote, [...] "No eye can see Him, nor thought apprehend Him, nor language describe Him; and those who love Him speak of Him thus: [...] "Father, and God of Truth" [...] (A Discourse Which Was in the Presence of Antoninus Caesar). Melito also wrote, [...] "For the deeds done by Christ after His baptism, and especially His miracles, gave indication and assurance {{to the world of the}} Deity <b>hidden</b> in His <b>flesh.</b> For, being at once both God and perfect man likewise...He concealed the signs of His Deity, although He was the true God existing before all ages" [...] (Melito. On the Nature of Christ. From Roberts and Donaldson. In Ante-Nicene Fathers). This clearly shows that Melito considered Christ to be God, as well as the Father. There is no indication in any of the surviving writings of Melito that he considered that the Holy Spirit was also God, furthermore, the following passage suggests that he seemed to hold a binitarian view as he wrote, [...] "The finger of the Lord-the Holy Spirit, by whose operation the tables of the law in Exodus are said to have been written" ...|$|R
60|$|Notwithstanding all this, {{the fear}} of death {{came back to me}} in a little while, {{and for a long time}} disquieted me, {{especially}} when the fact of death was brought sharply before me. These reminders were only too frequent; there was seldom a day on which I did not see something killed. When the killing was instantaneous, as when a bird was shot and dropped dead like a stone, I was not disturbed; it was nothing but a strange, exciting spectacle, but failed to bring the fact of death home to me. It was chiefly when cattle were slaughtered that the terror returned in its full force. And no wonder! The native manner of killing a cow or bullock at that time was peculiarly painful. Occasionally it would be slaughtered out of sight on the plain, and the <b>hide</b> and <b>flesh</b> brought in by the men, but, as a rule, the beast would be driven up close to the house to save trouble. One of the two or three mounted men engaged in the operation would throw his lasso over the horns, and, galloping off, pull the rope taut; a second man would then drop from his horse, and running up to the animal behind, pluck out his big knife and with two lightning-quick blows sever the tendons of both hind legs. Instantly the beast would go down on his haunches, and the same man, knife in hand, would flit round to its front or side, and, watching his opportunity, presently thrust the long blade into its throat just above the chest, driving it in to the hilt and working it round; then when it was withdrawn a great torrent of blood would pour out from the tortured beast, still standing on his fore-legs, bellowing all the time with agony. At this point the slaughterer would often leap lightly on to its back, stick his spurs in its sides, and, using the flat of his long knife as a whip, pretend to be riding a race, yelling with fiendish glee. The bellowing would subside into deep, awful, sob-like sounds and chokings; then the rider, seeing the animal about to collapse, would fling himself nimbly off. The beast down, they would all run to it, and throwing themselves on its quivering side as on a couch, begin making and lighting their cigarettes.|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{programmatic}} first chapter of the Physiologus about the lion. Its three allegories refer to Christ’s incarnation, his death and his resurrection. In general {{the author of the}} Physiologus does barely allude to dogmatic conceptions and exegetical traditions of his age and expects his readers to fill any voids (‚Leerstellen’). A detailed analysis of the complex religious-historical background of the lion-chapter offers the possibility to draw some chronological conclusions (based {{on the assumption that the}} 1 st chapter has to be regarded as an integral ¬part of the Physiologus’ first version). Whereas the figure of the hidden descent of the Saviour can be traced back to ‘heterodox’ Christian traditions of the 2 nd cent. the motive of his angelomorphic status and the intertextual reference to Ps 24 (23 LXX) are rather indebted to Origen and his theology. Moreover, the leitmotif of Christ’s „divine nature (theotēs) <b>hidden</b> in the <b>flesh</b> (/body) “ points most likely to the 4 th cent. The lion chapter shows also traces of the 4 th cent. debates about the status of Christ between death and resurrection (triduum mortis). If the first version of the Physiologus originated in the first half of the 4 th cent. his milieu might probably be found among Origenist monks in Egypt (who were perhaps also transmitters of Gnostic traditions and texts). Finally the article {{deals with the}} hermeneutical profile of the Physiologus’ allegorical method and his basic conception of the ‘two books of God’, nature and Scripture...|$|R
60|$|Case-hardening is {{the name}} given to a simple process, by which the outside of iron may be turned into steel. Small tools, fish-hooks, and keys, etc., are usually made of iron; they are {{fashioned}} first, and case-hardened afterwards. There are good reasons for this: first, {{because it is the}} cheapest way of making them; and secondly, because while steel is hard, iron is tough; and anything made of iron and coated with steel, combines some of the advantages of both metals. The civilised method of case-hardening, is to brighten up the iron and to cover it with prussiate of potash, either powdered or made into a paste. The iron is then heated, until the prussiate of potash has burned away: this operation is repeated three or four times. Finally, the iron, now covered with a thin layer of steel, is hardened by quenching it in water. In default of prussiate of potash, animal or even vegetable charcoal may be used, but the latter is a very imperfect substitute. To make animal charcoal, take a scrap of leather, <b>hide,</b> hoof, horn, <b>flesh,</b> blood--anything, in fact, that has animal matter in it; dry it into hard chips like charcoal, before a fire, and powder it. Put the iron that is to be case-hardened, with some of this charcoal round it, into the midst of a lump of loam. This is first placed near the fire to harden, and then quite into it, where it should be allowed to slowly attain a blood-red heat, but no higher. Then, break open the lump, take out the iron, and drop it into water to harden.|$|R
