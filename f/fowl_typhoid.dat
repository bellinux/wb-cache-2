40|$|<b>Fowl</b> <b>typhoid</b> and {{pullorum disease}} {{are among the}} most {{important}} diseases of poultry. These conditions are caused by two very closely related organisms, which were once thought to be different species but have recently been classified as biovars of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica. Pullorum disease is usually symptomatic only in young birds. The mortality rate varies, but it can be as high as 100 %. <b>Fowl</b> <b>typhoid</b> resembles pullorum disease in young birds, {{but it is also a}} serious concern in growing and adult poultry. The control of these diseases is complicated by vertical transmission: hens can become subclinically infected carriers, and pass the infections to their embryos in the egg. <b>Fowl</b> <b>typhoid</b> and pullorum disease have been eradicated from commercial poultry in many developed countries including the United States and Canada, but they may persist in backyard poultry flocks and game birds.

40|$|Four {{strains of}} Salmonella gallinarum {{isolated}} from independent cases of <b>fowl</b> <b>typhoid</b> all possessed both an 85 -kilobase and a 2. 5 -kilobase plasmid. Each plasmid was eliminated in turn {{from one of}} the strains by transposon labeling and curing at 42 degrees C. Elimination of the small plasmid had no effect on the high virulence of the strain for newly hatched and 2 -week-old chickens. Whereas oral inoculation of 2 -week-old chickens with the parent strain produced 90 % mortality with characteristic signs of <b>fowl</b> <b>typhoid,</b> inoculation of the large-plasmid-minus strain produced 0 % mortality. A corresponding increase in the 50 % lethal dose from log 10 1. 1 to greater than log 10 7. 3 was seen with the large-plasmid-minus strain after intramuscular inoculation. Reintroduction of the large plasmid completely restored virulence. A role for the plasmid-linked virulence genes in both invasion and growth in the reticuloendothelial system is suggested by the failure of the large-plasmid-minus strain to penetrate to the liver and spleen after oral inoculation and by its increased clearance from the reticuloendothelial system after intravenous inoculation.

Engineering attenuated Salmonella Gallinarum (S. Gallinarum) vaccine delivering H 5 LPAI antigens can be employed as a bivalent vaccine against <b>fowl</b> <b>typhoid</b> and LPAI viruses, while still offering economic viability and sero-surveillance capacity. In this study, we developed a JOL 1814 bivalent vaccine candidate against LPAI virus infection and <b>fowl</b> <b>typhoid</b> by engineering the attenuated S. Gallinarum to deliver the globular head (HA 1) domain of hemagglutinin protein from H 5 LPAI virus through pMMP 65 constitutive expression plasmid. The important feature of the developed JOL 1814 was the delivery of the HA 1 antigen to cytosol of peritoneal macrophages. Immunization of chickens with JOL 1814 produced significant level of humoral, mucosal, cellular and IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 17 and IFN-γ cytokine immune response against H 5 HA 1 and S. Gallinarum antigens in the immunized chickens. Post-challenge, only the JOL 1814 immunized chicken showed significantly faster clearance of H 5 N 3 virus in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs, and 90 % survival rate against lethal challenge with a wild type S. Gallinarum. Furthermore, the JOL 1814 immunized were differentiated from the H 5 N 3 LPAI virus infected chickens by matrix (M 2) gene-specific real-time PCR. In conclusion, {{the data from the}} present showed that the JOL 1814 can be an effective bivalent vaccine candidate against H 5 N 3 LPAI and <b>fowl</b> <b>typhoid</b> infection in poultry while still offering sero-surveillance property against H 5 avian influenza virus...|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{were planned}} {{to study the}} {{influence}} of selection upon natural resistance to <b>fowl</b> <b>typhoid</b> in the chicken, and to determine something about the genetic nature of differences in resistance. Using a pathogen of constant virulence and a uniform method of infection, {{it was determined that}} degree of infection influenced the mortality in unselected chicks. Both total mortality and rate of mortality were increased by the heavier doses. Four generations of selection for resistance to a standard dose of <b>fowl</b> <b>typhoid</b> bacteria resulted in a decided decrease in mortality in the selected population. The mortalities observed in the chicks of the selected generations, S 1 to S 4, were respectively 40, 29, 15 and 23 percent. In the unselected (control) population the respective mortalities were 90, 93, 86 and 86 percent. The increased mortality in the selected S 4 population was due to unavoidable chilling of the last two groups of chicks tested in that generation. An analysis of the breeding records of the selected population shows degrees of inbreeding over 30 percent for some of the birds of this stock, but so far it is difficult to evaluate the part that the inbreeding has played in bringing about the increased resistance of the selected stock. Reciprocal crosses of selected by unselected birds demonstrated that the male as well as the female transmits resistance to the offspring. These results show that a passive transfer of immunity was not a great, if existent, factor in the enhanced resistance of the selected progeny. F 1, F 2 and backcross progenies from a parental cross of resistant with highly susceptible unselected birds indicated the presence of genetic factors for resistance. No evidence was found of a linkage between major factors for resistance or susceptibility and the gene for inhibition of plumage color (I), or its allelomorph (i). Nor was there evidence of major sex-linked factors for resistance. With the exception of one cross (selected males with unselected females) significant differences in mortality were not observed between males and females. Inherent resistance to <b>fowl</b> <b>typhoid</b> is undoubtedly controlled by multiple factors some of which show dominance or partial dominance. Because of the complexities introduced by environmental variations and the interrelations of host and pathogen, the genetic analysis of resistance to <b>fowl</b> <b>typhoid</b> must await the development of inbred lines which react in a uniform and reasonably constant manner to infection with this bacterium...|$|E

A total of 700 serum samples made up of 450 exotic and 250 local breed of chickens were used for this study with 37. 9 % seropositvity. In the free range system (19. 3 %) of the flocks sampled were seropositive for Salmonella gallinarium antibodies while in the semi intensive, 18. 6 % of the flock tested positive. The serum agglutination test (SAT) was adapted to the microtitre format used to determine somatic and flagella titres.

Gallinarum) is the causative {{agent of}} <b>fowl</b> <b>typhoid,</b> {{one of the}} major causes of {{mortality}} and morbidity on poultry farms. Even though it has been substantially eradicated in many developed countries, the disease still remains endemic in Central and South America, in Africa and in the Mediterranean countries of Europe. This leads to the routine screening of flocks, mainly by cultivation and serological techniques, which are expensive, as well as time and labour-consuming. Here we describe a simple and specific PCR-based method for detecting S. Gallinarum. It relies on two seminested PCRs which use four pairs of primers designed on the basis of two genomic regions which appear to be exclusive to the pathogen. Furthermore, an internal positive control was devised in order to avoid any false negative results. We performed sensitivity and specificity tests, and our findings showed the cogency of the system and its potential effectiveness even for routine uses...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} some {{predominant}} poultry (exotic breeds) diseases {{was carried out}} in Katsina metropolis, Katsina state, Nigeria using an oral interview and a close ended questionnaire which was issued to 30 selected Poultry Farm Owners within the study area after a thorough consultation of the records at the State Veterinary Clinic. The disease found includes, Coccidiosis (23. 42 %), Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD) (14. 57 %), Newcastle Disease (NCD) (14. 28 %), Chronic Respiratory Disease (CRD) (13. 14 %), Pullorum Disease (10. 57 %), Fowl pox Disease (8. 28 %), <b>fowl</b> <b>typhoid</b> disease (7. 14 %), Marek’s disease (5. 14 %), Heat stroke (2. 57 %), and Fatty Liver Syndrome (0. 85 %) were also recorded in significant percentages across the study area. According to the data obtained from the Respondents, NCD, IBD, Coccidiosis, Pullorum disease, CRD and Marek’s disease have the highest economic impact in their business. As such a complete biosecurity measures should be imposed to the farms and also a proper medication and vaccination schedule should be adhered to as well...|$|E
40|$|As {{a part of}} the 40 th anniversary {{celebrations}} of Avian Pathology we review the last four decades of Salmonella research which has led to major progress in our understanding of the bacteriology and infection biology of the organism through the huge advances in molecular biology and immunology that have accompanied technical advances in biology generally. In many countries combinations of improvements in management, sometimes under legislative pressure and supported by a number of basic biological interventions, have resulted in reductions in incidence in the Salmonella serovars that are commonly associated with food-poisoning to unprecedented low levels in parent flocks, broilers and layers. Utilisation of the information generated during the past few decades should improve the efficacy of surveillance and biological interventions both for the intestinal carriage that is associated most frequently with human infection and also for systemic diseases, including <b>fowl</b> <b>typhoid</b> and pullorum disease. These two diseases continue to be major economic problems in many countries where the possibilities for improvements in hygiene may be limited but which, nevertheless, are increasingly {{a significant part of the}} global economy in poultry meat...|$|E
40|$|S. Pullorum (SP) and S. Gallinarum (SG) {{are very}} similar. They are {{the agents of}} pullorum disease and <b>fowl</b> <b>typhoid,</b> respectively, and the two {{diseases}} are responsible for economic losses in poultry production. Although SP and SG are difficult to be differentiated in routine laboratory procedures, the ability to metabolize ornithine is a biochemical test {{that may be used}} to achieve this aim. While SP is able to decarboxylate this amino acid, SG is not. However, the isolation of strains showing atypical biochemical behavior has made this differentiation difficult. One of the genes associated with the metabolization of the amino acid ornithine is called speC, and is found in both serovars. The analysis of 21 SP and 15 SG strains by means of PCR did not enable the differentiation of the two serovars, because fragments produced were identical. However, after enzymatic treatment with restriction enzyme Eco RI, the band pattern of each serovar showed to be different, even in samples of atypical biochemical behavior. This fact enabled the standardization of the technique for a quick and safe differentiation of serovars Pullorum and Gallinarum...|$|E
40|$|Salmonellosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} foodborne diseases worldwide. Food animals have been identified as reservoirs for nontyphoid Salmonella infections. in poultry, host-specific Salmonella infections cause <b>fowl</b> <b>typhoid</b> and pullorum diseases that produce economic losses in different parts of the world. Several measures have been used to prevent and control Salmonella infections in poultry, and vaccination is the most practical measure because it avoids contamination of poultry products and by-products and prevents disease in humans. Salmonella vaccines can decrease public health risk by reducing colonization and organ invasion, including invasion of reproductive tissues, and by diminishing fecal shedding and environmental contamination. We review available information on the host-specific and non-host-specific Salmonella serotypes found in poultry and the improved understanding of the pathogenesis of and immune responses to infection. We also include some approaches based on updated publications regarding killed and live attenuated vaccines and their immune mechanisms of protection.

40|$|INDIVIDUALS within every {{species of}} animals, {{including}} the chicken, possess a great ability to resist certain diseases. If the physiological {{factors contributing to}} this resistance were known it might conceivably be possible to en-hance in some manner the resistance of susceptible animals. In an attempt to identify these factors, a study of <b>fowl</b> <b>typhoid</b> and its effects upon the endo-crine and lymphatic systems was under-taken. Evidence has been obtained which in-dicates that the glands of the endocrine system, particularly the adrenal, {{may play a role}} in the defense mechanism of an animal. Many investigators have noted weight and/or histological changes, usu-ally suggesting increased activity, in the adrenal glands of man and experimental animals with various diseases. Refer-ences to this subject have been extensively considered by Selye (1950). Even though the activity of the ad-renal glands seems to increase when infection occurs, the use of adrenal corti-cal hormones for the purpose of enhancing antibody titers has produced contradic-tory results. Dougherty et al. (1945) con-cluded that adrenal cortical mediation was apparently concerned in the release of antibodies. The antibody production to sheep erythrocytes was found by Chase et al. (1946) to be enhanced in mice, rats, and rabbits by aqueous adrenal cortica...|$|E
40|$|MARTINEZ Nadal el al. (1964, 1965) {{reported}} {{the presence of}} antibiotic substances in extracts of the brown alga, Sargassum natans, {{as well as the}} red alga, Chondria littoralis, and the green alga, Cymopolia barbala. Among the organisms affected in vitro by these substances was Salmonella gallinarum, the causative agent of <b>fowl</b> <b>typhoid.</b> The studies presented in this report were undertaken to determine whether the inclusion of Sargassum natans in the diet of chicks would affect the outcome of an infection with S. gallinarum. MATERIALS AND METHODS The chicks used in these studies were White Plymouth Rocks obtained from a commercial hatchery. The diet used was based on soybean meal and corn. The composition is presented in Table 1. Two lots of 20 chicks each were fed each diet. In the first experiment the diets were fed from the day of hatching, and in the sec-ond experiment they were fed from the fourth week onward. At four weeks of age in the first experiment and five weeks of age in the second the chicks were inocu-lated per os with S. gallinarum. The culture of S. gallinarum used was originally isolated from chickens submit-ted to the North Carolina State Univer-sity diagnostic laboratory. The organis...|$|E
