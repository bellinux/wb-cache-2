50|$|Catalytic bead sensors are {{commonly}} used to measure combustible gases that present an explosion hazard when concentrations are between the lower <b>explosion</b> <b>limit</b> (LEL) and upper <b>explosion</b> <b>limit</b> (UEL). Active and reference beads containing platinum wire coils are situated on opposite arms of a Wheatstone bridge circuit and electrically heated, up to a few hundred degrees C. The active bead contains a catalyst that allows combustible compounds to oxidize, thereby heating the bead even further and changing its electrical resistance. The resulting voltage difference between the active and passive beads {{is proportional to the}} concentration of all combustible gases and vapors present. The sampled gas enters the sensor through a sintered metal frit, which provides a barrier to prevent an explosion when the instrument is carried into an atmosphere containing combustible gases. Pellistors measure essentially all combustible gases, but they are more sensitive to smaller molecules that diffuse through the sinter more quickly. The measureable concentration ranges are typically from a few hundred ppm to a few volume percent. Such sensors are inexpensive and robust, but require a minimum of a few percent oxygen in the atmosphere to be tested and they can be poisoned or inhibited by compounds such as silicones, mineral acids, chlorinated organic compounds, and sulfur compounds.|$|E

In the present study, the volumetric content of the H 2, CO, CH 4 in the gas mixture are chosen as the input of the BPNN model, while the lower and upper concentration explosive limits as the output, respectively. The predications for lower and upper <b>explosion</b> <b>limits</b> are found to present good agreement with that observed in experiment. For example, the maximum relative error between the predictions of the lower and upper <b>explosion</b> <b>limits</b> and the experiment are only 3. 90 % and 3. 57 %, and the correlation coefficient for lower and upper <b>explosion</b> <b>limits</b> are respectively 0. 971 and 0. 981, which are much more accurate than the prediction by the Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) and various empirical correlations.

40|$|Four {{different}} existing {{methods to}} calculate the upper <b>explosion</b> <b>limit</b> of methane-air mixtures at initial pressures up to 10 bar and initial temperatures up to 200 °C are evaluated by comparison with existing experimental data. Planar freely propagating flames are calculated with {{the inclusion of a}} radiation heat loss term in the energy conservation equation to numerically obtain explosion limits. Three different reaction mechanisms are used in these calculations. At atmospheric pressure, the results of these calculations are satisfactory. At elevated pressures, however, large differences are found, both between the numerical and experimental results, as between the different reaction mechanisms. Sensitivity analysis and reaction path analysis is used to study the differences between the reaction mechanisms. The spherically expanding flame calculations only show a marginal improvement compared with the planar flame calculations.

40|$|Fundamental to the {{creation}} of a hydrogen economy is a viable, safe and affordable hydrogen-energy-system. Examining carefully some of the key properties of hydrogen that are related to fire and explosion, it is found that hydrogen is combustible over a wide range of concentrations. At atmospheric pressure, it is combustible at concentrations from 4 % to 74. 2 % by volume. It has the highest flame velocity of any gas and its ignition energy is very low, which is 32 % less than methane gas.
