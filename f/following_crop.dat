50|$|Fusarium fungi can overwinter as saprotrophs in {{the soil}} or on crop debris that can serve as {{inoculum}} for the <b>following</b> <b>crop.</b> The fungus can also spread via infected seed. The presence of Fusarium fungi on crop debris or seed can cause Fusarium seedling blight and foot and root rot. Later, infection of the heads can occur with spores spreading by rain splash from infected crop residues. Another major infection route is airborne inoculum as spores can travel long distances with the wind. The cereal crop is most susceptible at flowering and the probability of infection rises with high moisture and humidity at flowering.|$|E
50|$|Several {{agricultural}} practices affect {{the risk of}} FEB. One of the major infection routes are infected crop residues from the previous crop where both {{the quality and quantity}} are important. Crop residues from susceptible crops such as cereals increase the risk of FEB in the <b>following</b> <b>crop.</b> Maize has been associated with especially high risk. Reduced soil tillage can also increase the risk of FEB. The amount of crop residues can be reduced by ploughing, where residues are incorporated in the soil where they decompose faster. High nitrogen application has also been associated with increased risk of Fusarium infection. Preventive {{agricultural practices}} may be less effective if a lot of airborne inoculum is present in the area.|$|E

In 2005, the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee, the Indian regulatory authority, released a study on field tests of certain Bt cotton strains in AP and ruled that Monsanto could not market those strains in AP because of poor yields. At about the same time, the state agriculture minister barred the company from selling Bt cotton seed, because Monsanto refused a request by the state government to provide pay about Rs 4.5 crore (about one million US$) to indebted farmers in some districts, and because the government blamed Monsanto's seeds for crop failures.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} different crops and plant species planted after soybeans for one year, {{in terms of}} their potential to inhibit the occurrence of weed species. The <b>following</b> <b>crops</b> that were planted as second crop after soybeans were evaluated: (1) corn (Zea mays) planted at spacing of 90 cm between rows, intercropped with Brachiaria ruziziensis in the inter-rows; (2) sunflower (Helianthus annuus); (3) crambe (Crambe abyssinica); (4) radish (Raphanus sativus); (5) rapeseed (Brassica napus); and (6) winter fallow - no plantation after soybeans. Phytosociological characterization of weed species was carried out at the pre-planting of soybeans in the <b>following</b> <b>cropping</b> season. Estimations of relative abundance, relative frequence, relative dominance and Importance Value Index were made for each species present. Areas were also intra-characterized by the diversity coefficients of Simpson and modified Shannon-Weiner, and areas were compared using the Jaccard similarity coefficient for presence-only, by multivariate cluster analysis. In the short&# 8209;term (a single cropping season), cultivation of winter crops do contribute for lower occurrence of weed species at the pre-planting of soybeans on the subsequent cropping season. The suppressive effects depend both on the species grown in the winter and in the amount of straw left on the soil by these winter crops.

5000|$|In {{combination}} with snow and abnormally low temperatures, a severe freeze ensued, causing extensive damage, especially to agriculture. The USDA reported the <b>following</b> <b>crop</b> losses: 35% to citrus, at least 95% to vegetables, between 50-75% of commercial flowers, 50% to permanent pasture lands, and 40% to sugar cane. Crop damage totaled to $350 million (1977 USD), while at least $100 million (1977 USD) of that figure occurred in Dade County alone. [...] In {{order to prevent}} water pipes from freezing, nurseries and farms ran sprinklers all night. However, some water began flowing onto roadways, and with freezing temperatures, caused ice to form on roads in western Dade County. Overall, the cold wave caused up to $2 billion (1977 USD) in damage. Several traffic accidents occurred due to snowfall and ice. Most notably, there was a 10 car pileup in Tampa, and another accident killed a man near Auburndale when his car skidded along snow and crashed into a truck.

40|$|In organic agriculture, {{weeds and}} {{nitrogen}} deficiency {{are the main}} factors that limit crop production. The use of relay-intercropped forage legumes may {{be a way of}} providing ecological services such as weed control, increasing N availability in the cropping system thanks to N fixation, reducing N leaching and supplying nitrogen to the <b>following</b> <b>crop.</b> However, these ecological services can vary considerably depending on the growing conditions. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify early indicators to assess these two ecological services, thereby giving farmers time to adjust the management of both the cover crop and of the <b>following</b> <b>crop.</b> Nine field experiments were conducted over a period of three years. In each experiment, winter wheat was grown as sole crop or intercropped with one of two species of forage legumes; Trifolium repens L. or Trifolium pratense L Two levels of fertilization were also tested (0 and 100 kg N ha(- 1)). After the intercropping stage, the cover crop was maintained until the end of winter and then destroyed by plowing before maize was sown. Legume and weed biomass, nitrogen content and accumulation were monitored from legume sowing to cover destruction. Our results showed that a minimum threshold of about 2 t ha(- 1) biomass in the aboveground parts of the cover crop was needed to decrease weed infestation by 90 % in early September and to ensure weed control up to December. The increase in nitrogen in the following maize crop was also correlated with the legume biomass in early September. The gain in nitrogen in maize (the <b>following</b> <b>crop)</b> was correlated with legume biomass in early September, with a minimum gain of 60 kg N ha(- 1) as soon as legume biomass reached more than 2 t ha(- 1). Legume biomass in early September thus appears to be a good indicator to predict weed control in December as well as the nitrogen released to the <b>following</b> <b>crop.</b> The indicator can be used by farmers as a management tool for both the cover crop and following cash crop. Early estimation of available nitrogen after the destruction of the forage legume can be used to adjust the supply of nitrogen fertilizer to the <b>following</b> <b>crop...</b>|$|E
