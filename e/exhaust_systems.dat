While hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used for severe poisonings, the benefit over standard oxygen delivery is unclear. The risk of death among those affected is between 1 and 30%.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Heavy-duty {{gas turbine}} is used widely in power {{generation}} industry for many advantages. Gas turbine <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> {{is an important component}} of the gas turbine. The work to study the <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> was less in the past. In fact, structure design of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> has important influence on performance and life of the gas turbine. In this paper, the three-dimensional structural model of gas turbine <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> is built, the thermal field and stress field for the <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> are analyzed by using finite element method (FEM). The maximum stress and distribution characteristics of stress field, the highest temperature and distribution characteristics of thermal field in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> are computed. These provide a reliable basis for reasonable design and safety evaluation of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> in gas turbine...|$|R

40|$|The <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> plays a {{vital role}} in {{removing}} the gaseous emissions that is being produced within the combustion chamber during fuel-air mixture activities. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> is defined as a series of chambers and pipes that starts at the engine and ends {{at the back of the}} car with the tail pipe. However if there are any leaks in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>system,</b> it provide a direct path for the emission gaseous including carbon monoxide to enter can be very dangerous as it provides a direct path for carbon monoxide and other dangerous gaseous emissions to enter the cowl vent at the base of the windshield and directly to the passenger compartment. The risk of exposure to these hazardous gaseous is also high especially during vehicle maintenance services in suspected cases of leakages to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>system.</b>   The inspection of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> is done manually in most of the automotive services workshops. In this paper, accidental risks of performing these inspection jobs on a vehicle’s <b>exhaust</b> <b>system,</b> performed by a technician are discussed. In order to minimize the risks to technicians or mechanics, a prototype device to detect exhaust leakage was developed using a gas sensor module and a web camera.

Axle ratios were also numerically lowered to aid in improving gas mileage. The 455 four-barrel V8, now rated at , was retained as the standard and only available engine.|$|E
25|$|Pre-cooling {{air before}} {{it enters the}} cylinders, {{injection}} of any substance other than air and fuel into the cylinders, variable-geometry intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>systems,</b> and variable valve timing were forbidden. Each cylinder could have only one fuel injector and a single plug spark ignition. Separate starting devices were used to start engines in the pits and on the grid. The crankcase and cylinder block {{had to be made}} of cast or wrought aluminium alloys. The crankshaft and camshafts had to be made from an iron alloy, pistons from an aluminium alloy and valves from alloys based on iron, nickel, cobalt or titanium. These restrictions were in place to reduce development costs on the engines.|$|E

25|$|Items {{such as the}} windscreen, wipers and <b>exhaust</b> <b>systems</b> {{are tested}} for {{condition}} and operation. Windscreen wipers will fail the test {{if they do not}} adequately clear the windscreen when used in conjunction with the washers. The exhaust system, in addition to checks on its condition and security, is tested to ascertain whether it is obviously louder than another vehicle of the same make and model with a standard exhaust system fitted. Dismantling of any part of the vehicle during the MOT test is strictly against test regulations, making the assessment of corrosion or worn components in certain areas on certain car models very difficult to determine accurately. As the MOT is only an inspection for road-worthiness at the time of test, the inspection of most accessories is not included. One exception is tow bars: their condition and their attachment to the vehicle is now included in the MOT.|$|E

The swiveling funnels of [...] had not proved successful and wind-tunnel testing had not provided an answer. As a result, Akagi and Kaga were given different <b>exhaust</b> <b>systems</b> to evaluate in real-world conditions. Kagas funnel gases were collected in a pair of long horizontal ducts which discharged at the rear of each side of the flight deck, in spite of predictions by a number of prominent naval architects that they would not keep the hot gases away from the flight deck. The predictions proved to be correct, not least because Kaga was slower than the Akagi which allowed the gases to rise and interfere with landing operations. Another drawback was that the heat of the gases made the crew's quarters located on the side of the ship by the funnels almost uninhabitable.|$|E
