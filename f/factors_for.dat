Even cases that do get seen by a family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed {{as one of the}} many common infectious diseases with overlapping symptoms.

5|$|Identified risk <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> plantar {{fasciitis}} include excessive running, {{standing on}} hard surfaces for prolonged periods of time, high arches of the feet, {{the presence of}} a leg length inequality, and flat feet. The tendency of flat feet to excessively roll inward during walking or running makes them more susceptible to plantar fasciitis. Obesity is seen in 70% of individuals who present with plantar fasciitis and is an independent risk factor.|$|E
5|$|Important <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> the {{germination}} of spores {{are mainly}} moisture and temperature. The spores usually remain germinable after several years; {{there were even}} spores preserved in herbarium specimens which germinated after 75 years.

At the germination, the spore shells open either alongside special germinal pores or chinks, or rip irregularly and then release one to four haploid protoplasts.|$|E

In {{order to}} solve the problem how to {{calculate}} the stress intensity <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> a cracked flattened Brazilian disk under mode I loading, the finite element method was employed to analyze the stress intensity <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> the cracked flattened Brazilian disk under mode I loading, based on the closed-form expression of the stress intensity <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> a cracked Brazilian disk subjected to pressure. The analyzed result shows that within the certain range of the load distribution angle, the formula of the stress intensity <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> the cracked Brazilian disk can be directly used to calculate the stress intensity <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> the cracked flattened Brazilian disk under mode I loading. 1...|$|R

5|$|Most of {{the risk}} <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, typeII diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> TypeI endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.|$|E

30|$|As {{discussed}} in the previous sections, AISC 360 - 10 that uses LRFD as its design format can secure a constant resistance <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> bending (i.e., ϕ =  0.9), regardless of the rotational capacity of cross sections. For KSSC–KCI, Eurocode 4, and JSCE 2009 that use PFM as the design format, however, the resistance <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> bending may vary significantly according to design variables, such as the strength of materials and the geometry and rotational capacity of cross sections, because the margin of safety for bending is indirectly determined from the resistance or safety <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> each material. In this section, the quantitative relationship between the resistance <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> bending and the rotational capacity was investigated.|$|R
40|$|Background: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) {{syndrome}} is an established and modifiable but under recognized risk <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> common disorders like stroke and hypertension. Objective: To assess awareness level {{of health care}} practitioners and medical students about OSA as a risk <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> stroke and hypertension. Methods: Questionnaire based survey with multiple response type and {{fill in the blanks}} type questions. The data was compiled and analyzed using SPSS version 19. Results: 180 participants completed the survey questionnaire. Only 24 (13. 3 %) identified OSA as a reversible risk <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> ischemic stroke. 11 (6 %) participants only could answer OSA as an identified risk <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> hypertension as per Seventh Joint National Committee report. Poor awareness extended over all categories of participants (medical students, trained doctors and nursing staff). Conclusion: This study reveals dismal level of awareness, among health professionals and medical students, about OSA being an established and modifiable risk <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> hypertension and ischemic stroke...|$|R

5|$|Lack of {{differentiation}} between homosexual and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women.

It has been determined, however, that the lower rate of lesbians tested by regular Pap smears {{makes it more difficult}} to detect cervical cancer at early stages in lesbians. The risk <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbians than heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.|$|E
