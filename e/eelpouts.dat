5|$|Within the abyssal and hadal zones, {{the areas}} around {{submarine}} hydrothermal vents and cold seeps have {{by far the}} greatest biomass and biodiversity per unit area. Fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids, these areas are often home to large and diverse communities of thermophilic, halophilic and other extremophilic prokaryotic microorganisms (such {{as those of the}} sulfide-oxidizing Beggiatoa genus), often arranged in large bacterial mats near cold seeps. In these locations, chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria typically form the base of the food chain. Although the process of chemosynthesis is entirely microbial, these chemosynthetic microorganisms often support vast ecosystems consisting of complex multicellular organisms through symbiosis. These communities are characterized by species such as vesicomyid clams, mytilid mussels, limpets, isopods, giant tube worms, soft corals, <b>eelpouts,</b> galatheid crabs, and alvinocarid shrimp. The deepest seep community discovered thus far is in the Japan Trench, at a depth of 7700meters.|$|E

25|$|Organisms {{living in}} the depths of Barkley Canyon have evolved to be able to persist in areas with high pressure, no light, and low nutrients/food availability. The Barkley Canyon {{instruments}} span a diversity of habitats, each of which is associated with its own specialized biological community. Most of the areas within Barkley Canon are characterised by a soft, finely sedimented seafloor. Video observations suggest that animal densities are higher at the shallower sites compared with the deeper sites, although most species are present at all sites. A number of fish including sablefish, thornyheads, rockfish, flatfish, sharks, skates, hagfish and <b>eelpouts</b> have been observed throughout Barkley Canyon. The area is rich with invertebrates as well including molluscs (bivalves, octopus, snails), echinoderms (sea stars, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, and urchins) as well as arthropods (crabs and shrimp). Cnidarians are seen both on the seafloor (anemones, sea pens, and corals) as well as floating in the water column (jellyfish) along with other organisms such as salps, ctenophores, and tunicates.|$|E

50|$|The International <b>Eelpout</b> Festival is {{an annual}} {{gathering}} {{held in the}} town of Walker, Minnesota. It celebrates the <b>eelpout</b> (or burbot, scientific name Lota lota), an indigenous bottom dwelling fish that inhabits the regions lakes, in some cases being found as deep as 300m. The fish itself is described as a cross between a catfish and eel, giving it a slender disposition but retaining a tapered midsection with a full complement of pectoral and caudal fins. While Lota lota is known locally as <b>eelpout,</b> <b>eelpout</b> also may refer to a family of marine fishes. Leech Lake is known for its exceptional walleye fishing, making this festival a banner for the often forgotten <b>eelpout.</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates how {{temperature}} and energy allocation affect {{the growth of}} fish species. In a comparative approach two <b>eelpout</b> species, one temperate, Zoarces viviparus, and one Antarctic <b>eelpout,</b> Pachycara brachycephalum, were studied. Age, growth and fecundity in the field were investigated. The energy demands of metabolism, growth and excretion as well as body composition and lipids were measured and analysed at different temperatures in long-term acclimation experiments. In Pachycara brachycephalum the predominant lipid class in muscle and liver tissue over the whole temperature range are storage lipids. Zoarces viviparus changes the lipid composition to these storage lipids in the cold. The pronounced lipid metabolism in the Antarctic <b>eelpout</b> {{may be the result}} of evolutionary processes of high mitochondrial densities and low metabolic rates and the high availability of a lipid enriched diet indicated by the stable isotope analyses. The field growth patterns of Pachycara brachycephalum show in its natural habitat a lower growth rate than that of the temperate <b>eelpout</b> population in the Wadden Sea, whereas the experimental growth rate of the Antarctic <b>eelpout</b> was higher. Both the Antarctic and the temperate <b>eelpout</b> display optimum growth temperature close to their habitat temperature (12 degrees C for the temperate <b>eelpout)</b> or their evolutionary approach to the habitat (4 degrees C for the Antarctic <b>eelpout,</b> who most like entered Antarctic waters via Deep Sea). The food conversion efficiency of the Antarctic <b>eelpout</b> is high. This ability to ingest and absorb energy in short periods of local appearance and to store this energy for starving periods is crucial in an environment where food supply is unstable and pulsed. The slow field growth rates of the Antarctic <b>eelpout</b> are due to habitat temperatures below the thermal growth optimum and to food limitation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA cDNA {{encoding}} the <b>eelpout</b> (Zoarces viviparus) oestrogen receptor alpha (eERalpha) {{has been}} isolated from <b>eelpout</b> liver, cloned and sequenced. The cDNA contains a complete {{open reading frame}} encoding 570 amino acid residues (mw: 63. 0 kDa). The amino acid sequence of eERalpha showed {{a high degree of}} identity to ERalpha of other teleost species. The tissue distribution of eERalpha mRNA was examined using Northern blotting, RT-PCR and in situ hybridisation (ISH). All three methods identified a pronounced expression of eERalpha in liver, pituitary, testis and ovary. In the brain ISH experiments showed that ERalpha mRNA was highly expressed in distinct regions of the preoptic area and the mediobasal hypothalamus. We have provided evidence that the receptor is auto-regulated by 17 beta-oestradiol (E(2)) not only in liver but also in the testis, indicating an important role for E(2) during spermatogenesis in male <b>eelpout.</b> RT-PCR analysis showed a broader expression pattern including significant expression in the brain, kidney, heart, and gut of adult <b>eelpout.</b> In <b>eelpout</b> embryos eERalpha expression has also been identified, indicating a possible role for the receptor in early development. This study contributes to the accumulating evidence that in fish E(2) is not only involved in the regulation of liver specific proteins, but has a much broader range of targets...|$|R

5000|$|There {{have also}} been studies based on the {{carcasses}} of other, non-mammalian marine vertebrates that have fallen to the deep sea. In particular, the chance discovery of a whale shark carcass and three mobulid ray carcasses led to observations on the communities that form surrounding large elasmobranch falls as opposed to whale falls. [...] Whale sharks inhabit waters of roughly 1,000 meters depth regularly, which suggests {{it could be a}} regular form of food fall in areas where it is abundant. [...] Many <b>eelpouts</b> (Zoarcidae) were found surrounding the whale shark with some evidence of direct feeding as boreholes were observed on the carcass. Another theory suggests that the <b>eelpouts</b> were waiting for their main prey, amphipods and other small benthic animals. The three rays found were at varying stages of decomposition, leading to varying assemblages found surrounding the individuals. A higher abundance of scavengers was found surrounding the more intact individuals, including scavengers typical of whale falls like hagfish. Around the least intact individual a bacterial mat was observed in the zone of enrichment, but no clams or mussels typical of this environment (i.e. whale falls) were seen.|$|E
40|$|We are {{interested}} in the cellular mechanisms that support wide ranging latitudinal distribution of marine ectotherms and have studied a new facet of thermal tolerance in zoarcids fish, from different climatic regions. The common <b>eelpout,</b> Zoarces viviparus, from the North Sea was compared to the Antarctic <b>eelpout,</b> Pachycara brachycephalum, with respect to cellular oxidative stress parameters and the potential to induce metabolic reorganization during functional hypoxic stress. Functional hypoxia sets on as the consequence of critical warming in marine ectotherms, and we hypothesized that survival of thermal stress involves hypoxic signalling to induce re-organisation of blood supply to central tissues. It turned out very clearly that polar <b>eelpout</b> maintain higher antioxidant defence levels (antioxidant enzyme activities and 3 fold higher levels of liver glutathione) to counterbalance higher tissue oxygen solubility and to protect their susceptible membranes from oxidative damage. Both species have normoxic levels of hypoxia inducible transcription factor (HIF- 1 &# 945;). Acclimation (11 weeks) at above habitat temperature (5 °C) in the polar <b>eelpout</b> and at low temperature of 6 °C within the natural range of North Sea <b>eelpout</b> led to increased HIF- 1 DNA binding and dimer formation. In the talk, we will discuss new concepts of the possible function of hypoxia inducible factor in stress response of marine animal ectotherms...|$|R
