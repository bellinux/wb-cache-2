5|$|General Eisenhower issued {{orders to}} {{preserve}} the building during the bombardment of Frankfurt, because he <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it after the war as his headquarters.

5|$|In May 2012, it was {{reported}} that the United Arab Emirates was in the final negotiation stages to purchase several V-22s. It {{was reported}} that the UAE <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Osprey to support special forces. Both the UAE and the Pentagon sought a $58 million unit cost. On 10 November 2015, UAE selected an AW609 variant for search and rescue use and denied that there were current negotiations regarding the V-22.|$|E
5|$|The Arabs {{hoped that}} the disunity among the Byzantines would play to their advantage. Maslama had already {{established}} contact with Leo the Isaurian. French scholar Rodolphe Guilland theorized that Leo offered to become a vassal of the Caliphate, although the Byzantine general <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Arabs for his own purposes. In turn, Maslama supported Leo hoping to maximize confusion and weaken the Empire, easing his own task of taking Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|The year of Ali's {{ascension}} {{also saw}} {{the signing of the}} Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty between Britain and Germany. This treaty officially demarcated the spheres of interest in East Africa and ceded Germany's rights in Zanzibar to the United Kingdom. This granted the British government more influence in Zanzibar, which they <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> to eradicate slavery there, an objective they had held as early as 1804.|$|E
5|$|After {{basic design}} work was {{completed}} on the Tu-4 bomber, Tupolev decided {{to design a}} passenger variant with a pressurized fuselage, given the internal designation of Tu-70. It was <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> as many Tu-4 components as possible to reduce cost and save development time. It was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane with tricycle landing gear, powered by four Shvetsov ASh-73TK radial engines. Design work on a mockup began in February 1946 and the Council of Ministers confirmed an order for a single prototype the following month. A production decision for the Tu-12, {{as it was to}} be known, would be made after testing.|$|E
5|$|All six {{ships were}} <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> {{two sets of}} Brown, Boveri, & Co. and Wagner {{turbines}} or Marine-type turbines built by Germaniawerft and four MAN double-acting 12-cylinder two-stroke diesels. Q and R however, was equipped with an additional four diesels, {{for a total of}} eight. The turbines were powered by four Wagner ultra-high pressure boilers, designed to put out 58 atmospheres of pressure. The propulsion system drove three screws, although four were considered for Q and R. The ships' electrical power was supplied by four generators that produced 2,400kW at 220volts.|$|E

5|$|Argentina {{was still}} {{divided by the}} {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War. Menem proposed an agenda of national reconciliation. First, he arranged the repatriation of the body of Juan Manuel de Rosas, a controversial 19th century governor, and proposed to reconcile his legacy with those of Bartolomé Mitre and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who also fought in the Argentine Civil Wars. Menem <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the reconciliation of these historical Argentine figures {{as a metaphor for the}} reconciliation of the Dirty War. However, although the repatriation and acceptance of Rosas was a success, the acceptance of the military regime was not.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{formation}} of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, called the Armée d'Angleterre (Army of England) around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> this invasion force to strike at England, and was so confident of success that he had commemorative medals struck to celebrate the conquest of the English. Although they never invaded, Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation. Boredom among the troops occasionally set in, but Napoleon paid many visits and conducted lavish parades in order to boost morale.|$|E
5|$|Cray had <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> gallium {{arsenide}} circuitry in the Cray-2, {{which would not}} only offer much higher switching speeds but also used less energy and thus ran cooler as well. At the time the Cray-2 was being designed, the state of GaAs manufacturing simply was {{not up to the}} task of supplying a supercomputer. By the mid-1980s, things had changed and Cray decided {{it was the only way}} forward. Given a lack of investment on the part of large chip makers, Cray decided to invest in a GaAs chipmaking startup, GigaBit Logic, and use them as an internal supplier.|$|E

5|$|Herd's {{knowledge}} of aerodynamics and Bruce McLaren's experience with Ford's sports car racing programme combined to spur the team into experimenting with aerodynamic bodywork. The M2A was {{fitted with a}} rear wing that produced downforce – downwards pressure on the car and tyres which allows faster cornering – and reduced lap times by three seconds at a test at Zandvoort circuit in November 1965, {{two and a half}} years before the Brabham and Ferrari teams eventually debuted wings in a Grand Prix. The team <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the wing on the M2B, but the engine problems that occurred prevented this.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, the {{airfield}} {{was occupied by}} the Royal Air Force, who erected Nissen huts and cleared the area of obstacles as it was <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the area as an Emergency Landing Ground. Three pillboxes were erected around {{the airfield}}'s perimeter. Between March and June 1940 the airfield was used by No. 15 Elementary Flying Training School at RAF Redhill as a relief landing ground. Knotley Hall was again requisitioned for use as the officers' quarters, although the tennis courts were off-limits.|$|E
5|$|In late June 1942, the Allies {{decided to}} seize {{bases in the}} {{southern}} Solomon Islands {{with the objective of}} denying their use by the Japanese to threaten the supply and communication routes between the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand. They also <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Guadalcanal and Tulagi as bases to support a campaign to eventually capture or neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain. Admiral Nimitz committed much of the Pacific Fleet to the task, including three of his four carrier task forces. They fell under the command of the recently appointed Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, commander of the South Pacific Area.|$|E

5|$|It was {{originally}} <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, {{because it could}} cause highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser. The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|Late on 11 July the 5th Guards Tank Army {{prepared}} for its forthcoming counterattack. Leibstandartes advance had disrupted Rotmistrov's preparations, as the assembly areas he <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> for the tank army's 18th and 29th Tank Corps were in German hands {{by the end}} of the day, forcing him to hastily revise his plans and select new positions. The arrival of the 5th Guards Tank Army just days earlier was detrimental to it in two major ways: the tank unit commanders did not have an opportunity to reconnoitre the terrain they would be travelling across, and the supporting artillery was unable to site and spot their fire.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool Women's Suffrage Society {{was formed}} with the {{intention}} of fulfilling a number of goals. It hoped to educate women on why they {{should have the right to}} vote and convince men of the same. It had links with Liberal MPs and <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> these to pressure the government to allow women's suffrage. In addition, the society tried to drum up support for their cause by holding small scale events, often with speakers at the Yamen Cafe in Liverpool's Bond Street. The events would also include poetry, singing or performances of acting or ballet by the Blue Bird Theatre Company.|$|E

Following the landings at Nadzab and at Lae, the Allies attempted to exploit their success with an advance {{into the upper}} Markham Valley, starting with Kaiapit. The Japanese <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Kaiapit to threaten the Allied position at Nadzab, {{and to create a}} diversion to allow the Japanese garrison at Lae time to escape.|$|E
5|$|The NKAP (Narodnyy komissariat aviatsionnoy promyshlennosti—People's Ministry of the Aircraft Industry) {{requested}} on 7 October 1940 {{that the}} OKO (opytno-konstrooktorskiy otdel—Experimental Design Department) of Factory (Zavod) No. 1, which {{would later become}} the Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau (OKB) begin work on a twin-engined long-range, single-seat escort fighter <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the AM-37 engine, then under development by Mikulin. It also requested that specifications, along with a model, be ready to be discussed on 12 November of that year. Three days later Mikoyan and Gurevich were ordered to produce three prototypes to undergo State acceptance trials on 1 August, 1 September and 1 November 1941. After the meeting, the NKAP broadened its roles to include bombing, torpedo attack, reconnaissance and interdiction.|$|E
5|$|The United States Air Force <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Gemini {{spacecraft}} to transport astronauts to its proposed space stations, the Manned Orbital Development System {{and later the}} Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL).
