Without careful moisture and temperature control during its manufacture and life thereafter, fungi will grow on tea. This form of fungus causes real fermentation that will contaminate the tea and may render the tea unfit for consumption.|$|E
5|$|Chess is a two-player {{board game}} {{utilizing}} a chessboard and sixteen pieces of six types for each player. <b>Each</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> piece moves in a distinct way. The {{goal of the}} game is to checkmate (threaten with unescapable capture) the opponent's king. Games do not necessarily end with checkmate; players often resign if they believe they will lose. A game can also end in a draw in several ways.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the steady state {{analysis}} of batch arrival retrial queueing system with two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> service under modified vacation policy, where <b>each</b> <b>type</b> consists <b>of</b> an optional re-service. An arriving batch may balk the system at some particular times. After the completion <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> service the customers may re-service <b>of</b> the same <b>type</b> without joining the orbit or may leave the system. If the orbit is empty at the service completion <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> service, the server takes at most J vacations until at least one customer is received in the orbit when the server returns from a vacation. Busy server may breakdown at any instance and the service channel will fail for a short interval of time. The steady state probability generating function for system/orbit size is obtained by using the supplementary variable method. Some system performance measures and numerical illustrations are discussed...|$|R

5|$|All baleen {{whales are}} carnivorous; however a 2015 study {{revealed}} they house gut flora {{similar to that}} of terrestrial herbivores. Different kinds of prey are found in different abundances depending on location, and <b>each</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> whale is adapted to a specialized way of foraging. There are two types of feeding behaviors: skim-feeding and lunge-feeding, but some species do both depending on the type and amount of food. For example, Antarctic whales mostly feed on euphausiids; however, this is mainly effective for lunge-feeders, whereas skim-feeders, like the right whales, feed primarily on copepods. They feed alone or in small groups. Baleen whales get the water they need from their food, and their kidneys excrete excess salt.|$|E
5|$|Anterior cord syndrome, due {{to damage}} to the front portion of the spinal cord or {{reduction}} in the blood supply from the anterior spinal artery, {{can be caused by}} fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks. Below the level of injury, motor function, pain sensation, and temperature sensation are lost, while sense of touch and proprioception (sense of position in space) remain intact. These differences are due to the relative locations of the spinal tracts responsible for <b>each</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> function.|$|E
5|$|Cooking styles vary {{by region}} and <b>each</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> cooking {{style and the}} {{ingredients}} used are generally based on the climate and location of the particular region and on traditions.

The West Bank engages primarily in heavier meals involving the use of taboon bread, rice and meat and coastal plain inhabitants frequent fish, other seafood, and lentils. The Gaza cuisine is {{a variation of the}} Levant cuisine, but is more diverse in seafood and spices. Gaza's inhabitants heavily consume chili peppers too. Meals are usually eaten in the household but dining out has become prominent particularly during parties where light meals like salads, bread dips and skewered meats are served.|$|E

5|$|Cross-country skiing has {{two basic}} {{propulsion}} techniques, which apply to different surfaces: classic (undisturbed snow and tracked snow) and skate skiing (firm, smooth snow surfaces). The classic technique {{relies on a}} wax or texture on the ski bottom under the foot for traction on the snow to allow the skier to slide the other ski forward in virgin or tracked snow. With the skate skiing technique a skier slides on alternating skis on a firm snow surface at an angle {{from each other in}} a manner similar to ice skating. Both techniques employ poles with baskets that allow the arms to participate in the propulsion. Specialized equipment is adapted to each technique and <b>each</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> terrain. A variety of turns are used, when descending.|$|E
5|$|For {{individuals}} with specific health problems, {{certain forms of}} birth control may require further investigations. For women who are otherwise healthy, many methods of birth control should not require a medical exam—including birth control pills, injectable or implantable birth control, and condoms. For example, a pelvic exam, breast exam, or blood test before starting birth control pills {{does not appear to}} affect outcomes. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a detailed list of medical eligibility criteria for <b>each</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> birth control.|$|E
5|$|Mass {{transfer}} diffusion {{takes place}} in the case where adparticle sources and traps such as kinks, steps, and vacancies are present. Instead of being dependent only on the jump potential barrier Ediff, diffusion in this regime is now also dependent on the formation energy of mobile adparticles. The exact nature of the diffusion environment therefore plays a role in dictating the diffusion rate, since the formation energy of an adparticle is different for <b>each</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> surface feature as is described in the Terrace Ledge Kink model.|$|E

Some plants encourage the presence of natural enemies of herbivores, which in turn protect the plant. <b>Each</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> defense can be either constitutive (always present in the plant), or induced (produced in reaction to damage or stress caused by herbivores).|$|E
