A large number of the animals injected in utero with <b>Old</b> <b>Tuberculin</b> failed to develop skin hypersensitivity to P. P.

The failure of animals which had been injected with <b>Old</b> <b>Tuberculin</b> in fetal life to respond hypersensitively to P. P.

Fetal injection with killed BCG conferred a state of tolerance on a few of the animals, and rendered others tuberculin-sensitive. Fetal injection with living BCG sensitized most of the animals to tuberculin, even when fetal exposure was as early as 46 days before birth, and induced tolerance in none. Fetuses of the same litter, injected simultaneously with identical inocula, often responded differently, some becoming tolerant to tuberculin, others developing hypersensitivity, and still others remaining immunologically unaffected, becoming neither sensitive nor tolerant.
