25|$|As {{the century}} progressed, tomato ketchup began its ascent in {{popularity}} in the United States. Ketchup was popular long before <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes</b> were. Many Americans continued to question whether {{it was safe to}} eat raw tomatoes. However, they were much less hesitant to eat tomatoes as part of a highly processed product that had been cooked and infused with vinegar and spices.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fresh</b> <b>tomatoes</b> {{received}} at a tomato processing plant {{can be turned}} into a variety of different products, one of which includes ketchup. The process begins by washing the tomatoes to remove any outer dirt and foreign matter from the skin prior to processing. Upon inspection, damaged, spoiled or unwanted tomatoes will be sorted out manually. Tomatoes will usually be conveyed by water throughout the preliminary stages to avoid bruising.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other {{fruits and}} vegetables, where {{nutritional}} content such as vitamin C is diminished upon cooking, processing of tomatoes increases {{the concentration of}} bioavailable lycopene. Lycopene in tomato paste is up to four times more bioavailable than in <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes.</b> The reason is that in raw plant foods, lycopene is insoluble in water and is tightly bound to vegetable fiber. Processed tomato products such as pasteurized tomato juice, soup, sauce, and ketchup contain a higher concentration of bioavailable lycopene compared to raw tomatoes.|$|E
40|$|Increased <b>fresh</b> <b>tomato</b> {{trade has}} {{prompted}} {{a number of}} trade disputes between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. One precondition of an antidumping dispute is meeting the "likeness of product" criterion. However, <b>fresh</b> <b>tomato</b> shipments and imports are highly seasonal, suggesting {{that the degree of}} substitutability (or product likeness) may depend fundamentally on whether <b>fresh</b> <b>tomato</b> varieties are in- or out-of-season. We develop a seasonally adjusted inverse demand system using Canadian and Mexican monthly import data along with U. S. state shipping data to address both seasonality and product substitutability in the <b>fresh</b> <b>tomato</b> market. We find that market equilibrium and the degree of product substitution are affected by seasonality and product availability in the consumer choice set.

500|$|The BLT Cookbook {{discusses}} the author's {{love of the}} BLT sandwich, which according to Jordan is [...] "America's favorite sandwich".

[...] She discusses ways the combination can be used in soups, appetizers, and salads. Recipes are provided for multiple versions of the BLT sandwich. Jordan writes that to make the best sandwich, one should select the finest ingredients.

500|$|The {{vegetables}} {{most commonly}} added to borscht are beetroots, white cabbage, carrots, parsley root, potatoes, onions and tomatoes. Some recipes may also call for beans, tart apples, turnip, celeriac, zucchini or bell peppers. Parsnip {{may be used}} as a substitute for parsley root, and tomato paste is often used as well as or instead of <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes.</b> The traditional technique of preparing the soup is to precook the vegetables – by sautéing, braising, boiling or baking – separately from the meat and only then to combine them with the stock. This distinctive feature of borscht derives from the practice of slow cooking in the Russian oven (traditional masonry stove, used for both cooking and heating), wherein the differences in cooking times of individual ingredients had {{to be taken into account}} in order to ensure that all components reach doneness at the same time. The importance of this method is reflected in the Russian language, where a variant in which all vegetables are added raw directly into the stock is referred to by the diminutive form [...] rather than [...] Vegetables are usually julienned, except for potatoes and zucchini, which are diced. The beetroots may be partially baked before being sprinkled with vinegar or lemon juice to preserve the color and braised separately from other vegetables. Onions, carrots, parsley root, turnip and other root vegetables are sautéed (traditionally in animal fat, especially lard or butter) and then mixed with tomatoes or tomato paste. Dry beans are boiled separately. Potatoes and cabbage are boiled in the stock for about 15 minutes before the precooked vegetables are added.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of agricultural markets in African countries are inefficient and poorly integrated.

Secondary data on the prices of <b>fresh</b> <b>tomato,</b> onion, chilli pepper, sweet pepper, and fresh pepper (2003 - 2011) were obtained from Oyo State Agricultural Development Programme and were analysed using trend analyses, Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, Granger causality test and index of market concentration. Results showed that the prices of onion, chilli pepper and fresh pepper were non-stationary in their various level forms but stationary at first difference; while prices of <b>fresh</b> <b>tomato</b> and sweet pepper in urban markets were stationary at their level form at probability of 5 % respectively. The indices of market concentration for onion, sweet pepper, fresh pepper, chilli pepper were less than one suggesting high short-run market integration, whereas <b>fresh</b> <b>tomato</b> achieved low short-run market integration.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Fresh</b> <b>tomato</b> {{volatiles}} {{are formed}} in intact fruit during ripening and upon tissue disruption. There are different pathways {{involved in the}} biosynthesis of these volatiles. The oxylipin pathway uses free unsaturated fatty acids with the sequential action of lipoxygenase, hydroperoxide lyase and alcohol dehydrogenase to produce volatile aldehyde and alcohol compounds. Oxylipin volatiles {{are the most important}} components in <b>fresh</b> <b>tomato</b> aroma. In order to genetically improve the quality of tomato aroma, the biochemistry of aroma synthesis must be studied thoroughly.

40|$|While much of {{the trade}} {{liberalisation}} literature analyses liberalisation effects on trade volumes, we postulate the implications of trade liberalisation for price transmission and market integration between tomato producer and consumer markets under a high and a reduced period of agricultural, import tariffs in Ghana. Our objective is to determine whether price transmission and thus the factors responsible for market integration sufficiently improved across the two periods. Using the threshold autoregressive (TAR) model to estimate wholesale price series from four major <b>fresh</b> <b>tomato</b> markets in Ghana, we discover a mixed pattern of price transmission between market pairs. Whereas the transmission of price changes between markets improved for some market pairs, it deteriorated for others from the high to the low tariffs period. Averagely however, estimated speeds of price adjustment, which measure the level of price transmission, and thresholds that proxy transaction costs, demonstrate an improvement in {{the integration of the}} markets after import tariffs were lowered. Therefore, contrary to public onion and anecdotal evidence, the degree of market integration has not deteriorated following trade liberalisation in Ghana. Liberalisation obviously reduced the market share of Ghana’s <b>fresh</b> <b>tomato,</b> but there is no compelling evidence to suggest that trade liberalisation is responsible for the perennial marketing problems of Ghana’s <b>fresh</b> <b>tomato.</b> The role of other underlying factors needs to be examined in explaining the observed signals of market failure and in considering options for reducing the price volatility in and improving the market competitiveness for <b>fresh</b> <b>tomato</b> in Ghana.
