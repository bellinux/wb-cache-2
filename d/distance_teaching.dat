40|$|Abstract: Rapid {{development}} of communication technologies has brought revolutionary changes to language teaching and learning. The use {{of computer technology}} has become an integral aspect of language learning. A diverse array of technologies, such as online learning platform, CD-ROMs, Multimedia Network Courseware, write site and videoconferencing etc. {{have been used to}} enhance <b>distance</b> language <b>teaching,</b> but they don’t provide opportunities for oral output since most of the communication tools are text-based. This poses great impediment to language learning, so, this research strongly recommends that voice interactive technology, such as Wimba Voice, should be applied to <b>distance</b> language <b>teaching</b> especially in Radio & TV Universities—China’s largest provider of open and distance education.
