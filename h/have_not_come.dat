However the actual manuscripts of these copies of the Quran of the Companions <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> down to us, since all of them agreed on the correctness and validity of the copies which 'Uthman had arranged to be written and distributed for general use.

25|$|Like many {{developed}} European {{countries from}} the late 1940s to the 1970s, Sweden has received {{tens of thousands of}} guest workers from countries in Southern Europe and the Middle East (i.e. Bulgaria, Greece, Iraq, Italy, Romania, Spain, Syria, Turkey, and the former Yugoslavia). Second and third-generation Swedes of Southern European or Middle Eastern descent have adopted Swedish as their main tongue, or in addition to their immigrant languages, such as Arabic, Bulgarian, Greek, Italian, Bosnian/Serbian/Croatian, and Turkish. However, the criteria in European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages state that minority languages need a long history in the country to receive the classification, and thus, these languages <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> into question.|$|E
25|$|In every lens there is, {{corresponding}} {{to a given}} apertal ratio (that is, {{the ratio of the}} diameter of the stop to the focal length), a certain distance of a near object from it, between which and infinity all objects are in equally good focus. For instance, in a single view lens of 6 inch focus, with a 1/4 in. stop (apertal ratio one-twenty-fourth), all objects situated at distances lying between 20 feet from the lens and an infinite distance from it (a fixed star, for instance) are in equally good focus. Twenty feet is therefore called the 'focal range' of the lens when this stop is used. The focal range is consequently the distance of the nearest object, which will be in good focus when the ground glass is adjusted for an extremely distant object. In the same lens, the focal range will depend upon the size of the diaphragm used, while in different lenses having the same apertal ratio the focal ranges will be greater as the focal length of the lens is increased. The terms 'apertal ratio' and 'focal range' <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> into general use, but it is very desirable that they should, in order to prevent ambiguity and circumlocution when treating of the properties of photographic lenses.|$|E

500|$|Ha' K'in Xook (...) , {{also known}} as Ruler 6, was an ajaw of Piedras Negras, an ancient Maya {{settlement}} in Guatemala. He ruled during the Late Classic Period, from 767–780 AD. Ha' K'in Xook was a son of Itzam K'an Ahk II, and he ascended the throne upon {{the death of his}} brother, Yo'nal Ahk III. Ha' K'in Xook's reign seems to have ended either with his death or his abdication in favor of his brother K'inich Yat Ahk II; archaeologists and Mayanists <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> to a clear consensus on this. Ha' K'in Xook left behind several monuments, including stelae at Piedras Negras and a stone fragment from El Porvenir. In addition, a stone seat known as Throne 1 which was erected by K'inich Yat Ahk II, records either the death or abdication of Ha' K'in Xook.|$|E
500|$|In 1927, MacArthur and Louise separated, and {{she moved}} to New York City. In August that year, William C. Prout—the {{president}} of the American Olympic Committee—died suddenly and the committee elected MacArthur as their new president. His main task was to prepare the U.S. team for the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. MacArthur saw the team as representatives of the United States, and its task was to win medals. [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> 3,000 miles," [...] he told them, [...] "just to lose gracefully." [...] The Americans had a successful meet, earning 24 gold medals, and setting 17 Olympic records and seven world records. Upon returning to the U.S., MacArthur received orders to assume command of the Philippine Department. In 1929, {{while he was in}} Manila, Louise obtained a divorce, ostensibly on the grounds of [...] "failure to provide". In view of Louise's great wealth, William Manchester described this legal fiction as [...] "preposterous".|$|E
500|$|Years {{after its}} initial release, Streisand took to Larry King Live in 1991 and {{announced}} her displeasure with ButterFly and {{the songs on}} it. Biographer Tom Santopietro wrote that [...] "Guava Jelly" [...] and album track [...] "Grandma's Hands" [...] were among the bag songs on the album. He also stated that [...] "Broadway divas do not take naturally to singing 'Ooh baby, here I am. Come rub it on my belly like guava jelly'". In agreement, writer Shaun Considine claimed that one unknown critic in particular panned the track, stating [...] "Streisand was not born to sing reggae", while another joked that he/she had [...] "no comment" [...] to make {{in response to the}} release. Ben Gerson, writing for Rolling Stone, found the singer to be [...] "unconvincingly animal" [...] throughout her rendition. He continued, [...] "Being beautiful, romantic and desirable <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> to her so effortlessly that she can easily throw them over for the sake a little authentic, malodorous sweat." ...|$|E

500|$|Both photons and {{electrons}} create analogous interference patterns when {{passed through}} a double-slit experiment. For photons, this corresponds to the interference of a Maxwell light wave whereas, for material particles (electron), this corresponds to the interference of the Schrödinger wave equation. Although this similarity might suggest that Maxwell's equations describing the photon's electromagnetic wave are simply Schrödinger's equation for photons, most physicists do not agree. For one thing, they are mathematically different; most obviously, Schrödinger's one equation for the electron solves for a complex field, whereas Maxwell's four equations solve for real fields. More generally, the normal concept of a Schrödinger probability wave function {{cannot be applied to}} photons. As photons are massless, they cannot be localized without being destroyed; technically, photons cannot have a position eigenstate , and, thus, the normal Heisenberg uncertainty principle [...] does not pertain to photons. A few substitute wave functions have been suggested for the photon, but they <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> into general use. Instead, physicists generally accept the second-quantized theory of photons described below, quantum electrodynamics, in which photons are quantized excitations of electromagnetic modes.|$|E
