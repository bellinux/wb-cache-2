40|$|In practice, hydrophobing {{impregnation}} {{has been}} established as an effective surface protection system against water and de-icing salt attack. Cracks in concrete, whether impregnated by a hydrophobing treatment or not, are unavoidable and can therefore lead to damage. In absorption tests on laboratory samples, the significant influences of cracks on the penetration behaviour of capillary water have been determined and quantified. The experimental {{results show that the}} water uptake depends on the craclc width and the penetration depth of the <b>hydrophobing</b> <b>agent.</b> There exists a 'critical' crack width depending on the penetration depth of the <b>hydrophobing</b> <b>agent</b> which can maintain the hydrophobing behaviour. Finally practical conclusions of the present work are draw...|$|E
40|$|Modified {{starches}} {{in combination}} with tannins were used as binders for particleboards and medium density fibreboards. Certain modified starches decreased the viscosity, shortened the curing speed and prolonged the period of used of the tannin formaldehyde resin. With certain mixtures of 80 per cent TF resin and 20 per cent starch hydrolysate {{it was possible to}} manufacture particleboards procucing strength properties which met the requirements of flat pressed boards for structural engineering type V 100. With a starch portion of 40 per cent in the glue resin strength properties of the type V 20 were reached but not those of the type V 100. As far as the thickness swelling is concerned boards manufactured without <b>hydrophobing</b> <b>agent</b> reach the V 20 quality when TF resin/acid hydrolized starch (up to 30 per cent of the tannin is substituted by starch) is used. With regard to strength and thickness swelling MDF with TF resin/starch hydrolysate mixtures as binder are suitable for the application in dry areas...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. After {{hydraulic}} reclamation of the dredger fill, as {{the deposition}} of surface sludge requires a relatively long time, the consolidation treatment cannot be immediately performed until the sludge-water separation is completed and the separated water is drained. The laboratory test makes a {{research on the}} effects of chemical agents and drainage condition on the sludge deposition process. The research shows that the early-stage deposition velocity of sludge is increased obviously and the sludge-water separation time is shortened after water <b>hydrophobing</b> <b>agents</b> and polymeric flocculants are added. However, the later-stage deposition velocity is slow and the deposition strength is low. Thus, certain drainage conditions are required to increase the later-stage deposition velocity and deposition strength of sludge...|$|R
40|$|Studying {{structure}} and chemistry {{of wood and}} wood-based materials is the backbone of all wood research and many techniques are at hand to do so. A very valuable modality is X-ray computed tomography (CT), able to non-destructively probe the three-dimensional (3 D) {{structure and}} composition. In this paper, we elaborate {{on the use of}} Nanowood, a flexible multi-resolution X-ray CT set-up developed at UGCT, the Ghent University Centre for X-ray Tomography. The technique has been used successfully in many different fields of wood science. It is illustrated how 3 D structural and microdensitometrical data can be obtained using different scan set-ups and protocols. Its potential for the analysis of modified wood is exemplified, e. g. for the assessment of wood treated with <b>hydrophobing</b> <b>agents,</b> localisation of modification agents, pathway analysis related to functional tissues, dimensional changes due to thermal treatment, etc. Furthermore, monitoring of transient processes is a promising field of activity too...|$|R
40|$|Gypsum is an economy-priced {{building}} material which is particularly advantageous for the indoor application featuring {{a variety of}} positive physical properties, {{but it is not}} moisture-resistent. Thus, gypsum {{building material}}s are not suitable for outdoor application. At the Fraunhofer Institutes for Silicate- and Wood Research, Germany, a gypsum front panel was developed which is also suitable for outdoor application. One of the special feature of this panel is the multi-layer design. The carrier panel consists of a gypsum matrix containing mass <b>hydrophobing</b> <b>agents</b> and eventually reinforcing fibers. On the outside is applied a functional layer open to water vapor {{and at the same time}} imper-meable to water. A method which is wide-spread in the manufacture of modern texti-les. The functional layer consists of a glass fiber mat and an incorporated micro-poriferous structure with hydrophobic properties. The weathering resistance of the pa-nel was proved by artificial weathering in a facility for climatic simulation. The mechanical properties of the gypsum front panel are typical for gypsum. If the construction is adjusted to the panel also a static load carrying will be possible. Moreover, the panel is non-combustible and, therefore, it can be applied p. ex. in high buil-dings with special fireproofing requirement...|$|R
