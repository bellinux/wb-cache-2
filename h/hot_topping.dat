40|$|To produce {{cast steel}} crankshafts, risering and gating systems are developed. Filling and {{solidification}} simulations {{of the steel}} crankshaft rigging are carried out {{to confirm that the}} rigging developed will produce a low porosity casting. A sand mold is created with Computer-aided design software, based on the developed crankshaft and rigging. Two prototype crankshafts are cast from the sand molds, and analyzed for porosity. The porosity analysis results are compared directly to the simulated porosity, and found to be in good agreement. From the analysis of the prototype crankshaft, rigging systems for a two-on and single-throw crankshaft are developed. A new casting method for steel is developed. The counter-gravity with pressurization during solidification casting method utilizes vacuum pressure of 7. 3 psia to draw liquid steel into a mold, where it is held until the inlet has solidified. Once the inlet has solidified, the vacuum pressure is released, and the pressure of the entire system is raised to 45 psia. Exothermic <b>hot</b> <b>topping</b> keeps the top of the riser liquid {{while the rest of the}} casting forms a solid shell. Therefore, the pressure only acts on the liquid metal at the top of the riser, forcing the liquid metal to feed farther into the casting. The new method is tested with simple bar castings. Analysis of cast bars shows that centerline porosity is fed by the riser when pressurized, while the gravity-filled control casting is not...|$|E

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{the development}} of a simulation strategy is presented, which enables a detailed description of relevant regions to appropriately model the electroslag remelting process. One of the challenges is to ensure a sufficient efficiency of the numerical model {{so that it can be}} used to perform extensive parametric studies. This is achieved by combining multiple computational domains and coupling the simulation codes ANSYS FLUENT and ANSYS EMAG. Therefore the electroslag remelting process is divided into a droplet simulation and models that account for the fluid flow in the slag and fluid flow and solidification in the metal pool. The droplet simulation considers the multiphase flow and the interaction of fluid flow and magneto hydrodynamics to simulate the behavior of the metal droplets passing through the slag layer. The Lorentz force is the main driving force for the fluid flow established in the slag region, which causes the liquid metal film on the electrode’s bottom surface to be transported to the centerline. Therefore it was found that no metal droplets detach near the electrode’s edge. Instead they accumulate at a certain characteristic radius. Between this radius and the centerline metal droplets form and detach homogeneously. The fluid flow in the slag region is directed to the centerline near the electrode’s bottom surface, points downwards on the centerline, moves outwards near the phase boundary to the metal pool and is directed upwards at the surface of the copper mold. In the case of the smaller scale IME remelting plant, metal droplets only occur on the centerline. The steady state simulation of the electroslag remelting process developed during this work introduces a static phase boundary, which separates the slag and the metal region. The formulation of the static phase boundary drastically reduced the time required until convergence is achieved. The simulation model has been extensively validated by comparing the numerical results to experimentally gathered data for both the IME laboratory scale plant and the VDM industrial scale remelting unit. The numerical model has successfully been calibrated leading to a good agreement to the experimentally gathered data for all investigated geometries and process conditions. The validation has been done considering the local solidification rate as well as the pool geometry. Parametric studies indicate that the melting rate is the most important quantity that determines the pool geometry. Two freckle criteria by Valdés and Böttger were examined. The Valdés criterion suggested that freckles may form for a variety of process conditions and might even form in the ingot center. This is contradicted by the Böttger criterion, which states that no freckles should be found in any of the examined cases. As no freckles could be found in any of the examined ingots, Böttger’s criterion appears to be more reliable. This hypothesis is supported by both the more plausible freckle position and the increased risk for freckles caused by a melting rate fluctuation. The optical evaluation of the etched ingot slices is very important as it is used to reconstruct the shape of the liquidus isothermal line. For this purpose an automatic evaluation algorithm was created, that carries out this reconstruction by looking at the grain boundary orientation on slices. A camera equipped with a macro lens has been mounted on a driven traverse system that successively takes pictures of the entire slice. These pictures were then stitched together, resulting in a multi gigapixel image. It is now possible to zoom in on every position on the slice and to measure SDAS values. Therefore the SDAS can clearly be identified and each SDAS measurement is associated with the corresponding coordinates on the slice. This technique leads to an increased spatial resolution. The opinion on the correlation between SDAS and local solidification rate, however, is not unanimous in the literature sources. Interdendritic fluid flow simulations on a micro scale were performed based on the lattice Boltzmann method to determine the permeability perpendicular to the dendrites. The simulated permeability agrees very well with the calibrated permeability obtained from the remelting simulation. Besides using this permeability to validate the calibrated value, knowledge of the interdendritic permeability is required in Böttger’s freckle criterion. The influence of the copper mold’s base plate cooling on the process has also been investigated. It was found that its effect on the pool decreases quickly as the ingot grows. The influenced region gets even smaller as the melting rate is increased. Furthermore the electrode’s energy balance has been reviewed. It was concluded analytically and numerically that for a specific alloy the ratio between melting rate and electrode diameter is crucial to predicting a possible rise of the melting rate before entering the <b>hot</b> <b>topping</b> stage...|$|E
