500|$|Once Fillmore {{was back}} home in Buffalo, he had no excuse to make speeches, and his {{campaign}} stagnated through {{the summer and fall}} of 1856. Political <b>fixers</b> who had been Whigs, such as Weed, tended to join the Republican Party, and the Know Nothings lacked experience at selling anything but nativism. [...] Accordingly, Fillmore's pro-Union stance mostly went unheard. [...] Although the South was friendly towards Fillmore, many there feared a Frémont victory would lead to secession, and some sympathetic to Fillmore moved into the Buchanan camp lest the anti-Frémont vote be split, which might elect the Republican. Scarry suggested that the events of 1856, including the conflict in Kansas Territory and the caning of Charles Sumner {{on the floor of the}} Senate polarized the nation, making Fillmore's moderate stance obsolete.|$|E

2500|$|Magic is {{a central}} part of life in most of Earthsea, with the {{exception}} of the Kargish lands, where it is banned. There are weather workers on ships, <b>fixers</b> who repair boats and buildings, entertainers, and court sorcerers. Magic is an inborn talent which can be developed with training. The most gifted are sent to the school on Roke, where, if their skill and their discipline prove sufficient, they can become staff-carrying wizards. A strong theme of the stories is the connection between power and responsibility. There is often a Taoist message: [...] "good" [...] wizardry tries to be in harmony with the world, while [...] "bad" [...] wizardry, such as necromancy, can lead to an upsetting of the [...] "balance" [...] and threaten catastrophe. While the dragons are more powerful, they act instinctively to preserve the balance. Only humans pose a threat to it.|$|E

England players were sent to the pavilion, at which point it became clear that Gregory was insisting the match be halted while a new umpire was found. The ensuing disturbance became known as the Sydney Riot of 1879. [...] While allegations of collusion with match <b>fixers</b> began, a number of spectators began to cross the pitch and had to be fended off by players armed with cricket stumps for over thirty minutes.
