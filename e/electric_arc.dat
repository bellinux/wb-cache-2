5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an <b>electric</b> <b>arc,</b> welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, {{the brightness of the}} <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> is a source of the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the <b>electric</b> <b>arc.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the {{discovery}} of the short pulsed <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> in 1800 by Humphry Davy and of the continuous <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> in 1802 by Vasily Petrov, arc welding developed slowly. C. L. Coffin had the idea of welding in an inert gas atmosphere in 1890, but even in the early 20th century, welding non-ferrous materials such as aluminum and magnesium remained difficult because these metals react rapidly with the air and result in porous, dross-filled welds. Processes using flux-covered electrodes did not satisfactorily protect the weld area from contamination. To solve the problem, bottled inert gases were used {{in the beginning of the}} 1930s. A few years later, a direct current, gas-shielded welding process emerged in the aircraft industry for welding magnesium.|$|E
5|$|With ample {{current density}} and ionization, this forms a {{luminous}} <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> (a continuous electric discharge similar to lightning) between the electrodes. Electrical resistance along the continuous <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> creates heat, which dissociates more gas molecules and ionizes the resulting atoms (where degree of ionization {{is determined by}} temperature), and as per the sequence: solid-liquid-gas-plasma, the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma. A thermal plasma is in thermal equilibrium, {{which is to say}} that the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles (i.e. atoms, molecules and ions) and electrons. This is so because when thermal plasmas are generated, electrical energy is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by elastic collision (without energy loss) to the heavy particles.|$|E
5|$|Crucibles used {{to contain}} {{plutonium}} {{need to be}} able to withstand its strongly reducing properties. Refractory metals such as tantalum and tungsten along with the more stable oxides, borides, carbides, nitrides and silicides can tolerate this. Melting in an <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> furnace can be used to produce small ingots of the metal without the need for a crucible.|$|E

40|$|LGEP 2014 ID = 1589 International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{temperature}} {{measurements of the}} surface of tungsten electrodes submitted to <b>electric</b> <b>arcs</b> in nonstationary regimes in air at atmospheric pressure and with the estimation of the power and power density brought by <b>electric</b> <b>arcs</b> to the electrodes. Temperature measurements are proposed for tungsten anodes and cathodes for current intensity of ~ 30 A and duration of 3 ms. The temperature of the electrode surface at the instant the arc extinguishes is estimated in both electrode polarities. These experimental results are used in a model to estimate {{the power and the}} power density brought to the tungsten electrode surface by <b>electric</b> <b>arcs.</b> We found that the power surface density brought by <b>electric</b> <b>arcs</b> to the electrodes was in the range 1. × 109 - 1. 5 × 109 W/m 2 in the case of anodes and in the range 1. 3 × 109 - 1. 9 × 109 W/m 2 in the case of cathodes. It has also been found that reactions of tungsten oxidation had to be considered to explain the high values obtained for the power brought to the electrodes...|$|R

5|$|For the {{production}} of ferromanganese, the manganese ore is mixed with iron ore and carbon, and then reduced either in a blast furnace or in an <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> furnace. The resulting ferromanganese has a manganese content of 30 to 80%. Pure manganese used for {{the production}} of iron-free alloys is produced by leaching manganese ore with sulfuric acid and a subsequent electrowinning process.|$|E
5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW), {{sometimes}} referred to by its subtypes metal inert gas (MIG) welding or metal active gas (MAG) welding, is a welding process in which an <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> forms between a consumable wire electrode and the workpiece metal(s), which heats the workpiece metal(s), causing them to melt and join.|$|E
5|$|SMAW welding, {{like other}} welding methods, {{can be a}} {{dangerous}} and unhealthy practice if proper precautions are not taken. The process uses an open <b>electric</b> <b>arc,</b> which presents a risk of burns which are prevented by personal protective equipment {{in the form of}} heavy leather gloves and long sleeve jackets. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area can lead to a condition called arc eye, in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Welding helmets with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, and in recent years, new helmet models have been produced that feature a face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. To protect bystanders, especially in industrial environments, translucent welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the <b>electric</b> <b>arc,</b> but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E

40|$|During the {{treatment}} of an <b>electric</b> welding <b>arc</b> with ultrasonic oscillations, an improvement was found in overall source-arc stability.

5|$|The {{equipment}} is relatively inexpensive and simple, generally employing the combustion of acetylene in oxygen {{to produce a}} welding flame temperature of about 3100°C. The flame, since it is less concentrated than an <b>electric</b> <b>arc,</b> causes slower weld cooling, {{which can lead to}} greater residual stresses and weld distortion, though it eases the welding of high alloy steels. A similar process, generally called oxyfuel cutting, is used to cut metals.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{products}} of chromium ore refining are ferrochromium and metallic chromium. For those products the ore smelter process differs considerably. For {{the production of}} ferrochromium, the chromite ore (FeCr2O4) is reduced in large scale in <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> furnace or in smaller smelters with either aluminium or silicon in an aluminothermic reaction.|$|E
5|$|These {{processes}} use a welding {{power supply}} to create and maintain an <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> between an electrode and the base material to melt metals at the welding point. They can use either direct (DC) or alternating (AC) current, and consumable or non-consumable electrodes. The welding region is sometimes protected by some type of inert or semi-inert gas, known as a shielding gas, and filler material is sometimes used as well.|$|E

Eventually, results in the geometry of a plasma torch used for thermal spraying are presented. Other aspects, like the strategy to obtain a converged calculation, the discussion of boundary conditions used for stationary simulations in cross-flows and a pseudo-temporal evolution of a restrike phenomenon, are also discussed...|$|R

5|$|Alternatively {{pig iron}} {{may be made}} into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various {{processes}} {{have been used for}} this, including finery forges, puddling furnaces, Bessemer converters, open hearth furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> furnaces. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize {{some or all of the}} carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form an <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> between the electrode and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, a {{new process}} based on GTAW was developed, called plasma arc welding. It affords greater control and {{improves}} weld quality {{by using a}} nozzle to focus the <b>electric</b> <b>arc,</b> but is largely limited to automated systems, whereas GTAW remains primarily a manual, hand-held method. Development within the GTAW process has continued as well, and today a number of variations exist. Among the most popular are the pulsed-current, manual programmed, hot-wire, dabber, and increased penetration GTAW methods.|$|E

Characteristics of <b>electric</b> <b>arcs</b> such as the mean electric field in the arc column, the anode and cathode voltage drops, the length for which the arc extinguishes naturally and the mean energy dissipated per arc have been measured for three current values: 7, 70 and 300 A.

This is correlated with the variation of the mean electric field with pressure. Consequently, the energy dissipated per arc is also amplified...|$|R

5|$|Many {{different}} {{energy sources}} {{can be used}} for welding, including a gas flame, an <b>electric</b> <b>arc,</b> a laser, an electron beam, friction, and ultrasound. While often an industrial process, welding may be performed in many different environments, including in open air, under water, and in outer space. Welding is a hazardous undertaking and precautions are required to avoid burns, electric shock, vision damage, inhalation of poisonous gases and fumes, and exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
5|$|Weld spatter, {{while not}} {{affecting}} {{the integrity of}} the weld, damages its appearance and increases cleaning costs. It can be caused by excessively high current, a long arc, or arc blow, a condition associated with direct current characterized by the <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> being deflected away from the weld pool by magnetic forces. Arc blow can also cause porosity in the weld, as can joint contamination, high welding speed, and a long welding arc, especially when low-hydrogen electrodes are used.|$|E
5|$|Welding can be {{dangerous}} and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken. However, using new technology and proper protection greatly reduces risks of injury and death associated with welding. Since many common welding procedures involve an open <b>electric</b> <b>arc</b> or flame, the risk of burns and fire is significant; {{this is why it}} is classified as a hot work process. To prevent injury, welders wear personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long-sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye or flash burns in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes. Goggles and welding helmets with dark UV-filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure. Since the 2000s, some helmets have included a face plate which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense UV light. To protect bystanders, the welding area is often surrounded with translucent welding curtains. These curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, shield people outside the welding area from the UV light of the <b>electric</b> <b>arc,</b> but can not replace the filter glass used in helmets.|$|E
