In this study, fast, efficient and energy saving solution heat treatment (SHT) and ageing processes have been identified based on precipitation nucleation and growth mechanisms and a series of experiments. Material chosen was AA 6082, which is an alloy favoured for automotive body structures. The effects of heating rate, soaking temperature and time on SHT processes, and the influence on post mechanical properties, have been characterised.

40|$|A TEM {{study has}} been made of the effect of varying the {{magnitude}} of the applied stretch upon the distribution of S-phase after subsequent ageing of an 8090 Al-Li-Cu-Mg-Zr alloy. The S-phase has also been varied without stretching by means of a <b>duplex</b> <b>ageing</b> treatment. A comparison {{has been made of}} the yield stress and initial work hardening rates in tensile tests at temperatures between 21 °C and 277 °C of each of the microstructures produced. Dynamic recovery occurs at the lowest temperature in material subjected to the highest degree of prior stretch, and at the highest temperature in unstretched material. It is concluded that the dislocation substructure introduced during the stretch acts as an effective dislocation sink during high temperature deformation of the aged alloys. The duplex-aged material thus exhibits a high resistance to dynamic recovery. The work-hardening rates observed at the highest temperatures appear to be dependent upon the size and amount of the S-phase present...|$|E

Emphasis {{has been given}} to the effect of microstructure on stress corrosion crack initiation and propagation in Al-Li-Cu-Mg-Zr alloys (e. g. 8090 and 8091). In particular, the use of both isothermal and <b>duplex</b> <b>ageing</b> routes to develop overaged microstructures with increased resistance to stress corrosion crack initiation has been assessed and significantly, crack propagation plateau velocities of both under and peak aged 8090 were found to compare favourably with both 2024 -T 3 and 7075 -T 651. The applicability of accepted test methods developed for conventional medium and high strength aluminium alloys for determining exfoliation resistance of Al-Li-Cu-Mg-Zr alloys has been evaluated and results have been obtained which illustrate the hazards of relying on visual ratings to compare exfoliation performance.

40|$|AbstractSolute-rich beta {{titanium}} alloys such as Ti 38 - 644 (Beta- CTM) {{are known for}} an inhomogeneous precipitation of the strengthening alpha phase during aging. Consequently precipitate-free zones, referred to as “β flecks”, remain within the beta matrix when the material is solution treated above the transition temperature and subsequently aged at temperatures between 454  °C and 538  °C. Nevertheless, tensile tests performed on simplex-aged Beta-C show reasonable UTS values of about 1300 MPa. However, β flecks {{are considered to be}} detrimental with respect to fatigue properties. In order to eliminate this effect, a <b>duplex</b> <b>aging</b> cycle was designed for Beta-C. Depending on the prior working history of the alloy, heat treatment parameters in terms of times and temperatures were specified, in order to optimize the microstructure with respect to a high fatigue limit at comparable monotonic strength values. The results of this study indicate clearly that <b>duplex</b> <b>aging</b> leads to a significant improvement of the fatigue limit in the highly β-stabilized titanium alloy due to a homogeneous dense distribution of acicular alpha precipitates. The success of the modified heat treatment depends very sensitively on the parameters applied for the solution and pre-aging treatment. In this study, <b>duplex</b> <b>aging</b> led to an increase of the fatigue limit to 700  MPa and 750  MPa under symmetrical push-pull and rotating bending loading, respectively. A change of the tensile fracture mode from intergranular to predominantly transgranular was observed accompanied by a slight gain of ductility.

40|$|To produce useful strengthening, {{precipitation}} hardenable {{aluminium alloys}} rely on rapid quenching from the {{solution heat treatment}} temperature to suppress the formation of coarse equilibrium second phases. An unavoidable consequence of the rapid quenching of thick sections is the severe thermal gradients that quickly develop in the material. The attendant inhomogeneous plastic flow can then result {{in the establishment of}} residual stresses. Established procedures exist to minimise residual stress by quenching into boiling water or organic quenchants at the expense of ageing response. Residual stresses can also be relieved after solution heat treatment by the application of plastic deformation in a controlled manner. A limited degree of thermal stress relief is also reported to occur during subsequent artificial ageing treatments, especially <b>duplex</b> <b>ageing</b> treatments. It is generally accepted that the size of the residual stresses induced during quenching cannot exceed the yield strength of the material. However, for precipitation hardened aluminium alloys, stress magnitudes as measured by standard techniques can exceed the uniaxial stress required to cause plastic flow during tensile tests conducted immediately after quenching. An investigation to explain these observations involving measuring as-quenched tensile properties and room temperature stress relief in heat treatable and non-heat treatable aluminium alloys has been conducted. Two alloys were investigated: 7010, an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu precipitation hardenable alloy and 5251, a non-heat treatable medium strength Al-Mg-Mn alloy. Tensile properties were determined by heat-treating test specimens at 475 °C, cold water quenching and then testing without delay to avoid significant microstructural modification. The progress of stress relief at room temperature was then monitored utilising test coupons and standard x-ray diffraction techniques. Natural ageing of 7010 leads to a rapid increase in strength and a subsequent locking in of residual stresses (this cannot occur in 5251) and the change in residual stress is monitored as a function of time. An attempt has also been made to determine the efficacy of x-ray diffraction to monitor thermally induced stress relief. X-ray diffraction and hole drilling techniques to ASTM E 837 were utilised to follow the progress of isothermal stress relief at room temperature and 200 °C in both 7010 and 5251.

40|$|The {{past few}} decades have seen an {{increase}} in the use of beta titanium alloys as structural biomaterials. Their combination of excellent mechanical properties, corrosion resistance and biocompatibility, along with a lower Young’s modulus than stainless steel, cobalt-chromium and commercially pure titanium make the beta titanium alloys ideal biomaterials. This work evaluates the use of three beta titanium alloys for biomedical applications. Three beta titanium alloys, Ti 15 - 3 - 3 - 3, Ti SP- 700 and Ti Beta-C, underwent thermal processing to optimize mechanical properties. The alloys were subjected to tensile testing, hardness testing, fatigue testing, optical microscopy and SEM fracture analysis {{in order to determine the}} best processing conditions for biomedical alloys. In order to understand the effects of the thermal processing, the grain structures of the beta titanium alloys were examined. The fracture surfaces of the alloys were examined to understand the fracture and failure mechanisms involved. Thermal processing yielded good properties (998 MPa and 23 % elongation) in the Ti 15 - 3 - 3 - 3 alloy aged at 550 ºC. The annealed condition of the Ti SP- 700 produced good mechanical properties for biomedical applications (1031 MPa and 27 % elongation). Titanium Beta-C aged at 455 ºC yielded good mechanical properties (964 MPa and 23 % elongation). However, the Ti Beta-C alloy’s mechanical properties can be improved upon still by implementing a <b>duplex</b> <b>aging</b> process. All three alloys fractured in a ductile manner, which is desired for structural alloys. All three alloys, Ti 15 - 3 - 3 - 3, Ti SP- 700 and Ti Beta-c, can be processed to have good mechanical properties for biomedical applications, a combination of high strength (1000 MPa) and ductility (15 % elongation) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} laser surface melting (LSM) on {{intergranular}} corrosion behaviour of aged austenitic stainless steels (UNS S 30400, S 31603, S 32100 and S 34700) and <b>aged</b> <b>duplex</b> stainless steels (UNS S 31803 and S 32950) were investigated. LSM of the aged stainless steels was carried out using a 2. 5. kW CW Nd:YAG laser. The microstructure of the aged stainless steels after LSM depends on their compositions. After LSM, the aged austenitic stainless steels mainly contain austenite (γ) with some ferrite (δ) as the minor phase, but the carbide phases are completely eliminated. For the <b>aged</b> <b>duplex</b> stainless steels after LSM, δ becomes the major phase and the δ/γ phase balance is disturbed, whereas the sigma (σ) phase is eliminated. The degree of sensitization (DOS) and corrosion morphology of the aged stainless steels before and after LSM were determined by the double loop electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation (DL-EPR) using a potentiostat and SEM observation, respectively. Desensitization of the aged stainless steels has been successfully achieved by LSM and their intergranular corrosion resistance {{is found to be}} significantly enhanced as reflected by the decrease in DOS due to dissolution of the carbides or σ phase, which reduced Cr depletion or the possibility of solute segregation at the grain or phase boundaries, despite the presence of δ and disturbance of δ/γ phase balance.

However, the {{prevalence of}} PE in the subgroup of patients with respiratory symptoms and isolated calf vein thrombosis (CVT) is unknown. Such information is important in determining whether patients with CVT only and respiratory symptoms should undergo evaluation for PE. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of PE in patients with respiratory symptoms and isolated CVT. Methods: From 1992 through 1994, all patients assessed by duplex scanning for lower extremity DVT were reviewed, and those found to have isolated CVT and lower extremity or respiratory symptoms were identified. Patients who had respiratory symptoms or later developed respiratory symptoms in addition to lower extremity symptoms underwent pulmonary angiography or ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scanning. Positive results on pulmonary arteriograms or “high probability” V/Q scans were considered diagnostic of PE. Results: There were 105 patients with isolated CVT and symptoms. Twenty-six patients had respiratory symptoms; nine (35 %) had PE and two died. Seventy-nine patients had only lower extremity complaints; five later developed respiratory symptoms. All five had PE and none had progression of CVT on repeat <b>duplex</b> scanning. Neither <b>age,</b> gender, prior DVT/PE, obesity, pregnancy, medication, known malignancy, smoking, recent surgery, or trauma predicted PE.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{effectiveness}} and usefulness of the quench ageing on theservice properties of massive duplex cast steel. The mechanism of precipitation of a ε-Cu phase and its effect onthe mechanical properties of the cast steel were investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The ferrite substructure was examined on a JOEL JEM HREM. The analysisof chemical composition of selected micro-regions was carried out using a scanning electron microscope. Theverification of the metallographic examination results was done using the Thermo-Calc program. Findings: Quench ageing causes an increase in hardness and drop in impact resistance, which results from theformation of the ε-Cu phase. The ageing parameters have a substantial influence on the ferrite substructure and thedegree of coherence, dispersion and amount of the ε-Cu phase. The ageing treatment at 480 ˚C causes, in additionto the precipitation of the ε-Cu phase coherent with the matrix, the formation of a α’-Cr phase and an α-Fe phase. Practical implications: Duplex cast steels are becoming an irreplaceable material in the elements of equipmentexposed to the simultaneous action of corrosive and erosive environment. In the case of massive elements, suchas pump (rotors and guide vanes) and pipeline elements etc., which are operated in corrosive environments ofwater suspensions of solids of different type and gradation, the effect of ageing will be much lower than in smalllaboratory specimens, which is associated with the presence of a large amount of the incoherent ε-Cu phase inthe cast steel after the solution heat treatment. Originality/value: The lower limit of ageing temperature (480 ˚C) coincide with the temperature of anundesirable spinodal decomposition of the ferrite, which is partially responsible for the slight increase inhardness and a drop in plastic properties.

Twenty-one patients with primary vein varicose (group AI) and 15 patients (group AII) with primary deep venous valve incompetence (DVI) underwent biopsies of the gastrocnemius muscle during operation. Adductor biopsies obtained from the same limbs served as a control group (group B) and specimens from controls subjects without venous disease served as the second control group (group C). All the specimens were investigated by superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitric oxide (NO), Na+–K+-ATPase, Ca 2 +-ATPase and lactic acid (LD) determinations. Samples were subjected to light and electron microscopy following H & E staining, special ATPase, cytochrome oxidase/succinate dehydrogenase (COX/SDH) stains. ResultsNormal muscle architecture was seen following H & E, ATPase and COX/SDH staining and normal cell metabolism was observed in specimens of groups B and C. In group A, pathological changes were encountered in the gastrocnemius muscle including disseminated myofibril atrophy, cell denaturation and necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, proliferation and dilation of interfascicular veins. ATPase staining (pH 9. 4) demonstrated grouping of atrophic fibres, especially type I myofibril grouping, accompanied by moderate to severe atrophy of type II muscle fibres. However, no patient had selective type I fibre atrophy. Enhanced enzymatic activity in single or multiple myofibrils was demonstrated by COX/SDH staining in approximately half of the specimens in group AII. In group AII, electron microscopy showed swelling, myelin figure denaturation of mitochondria, disruption of the myofibrils and increased lipid droplets in the gastrocnemius muscle.
