5000|$|<b>Kermesite</b> or {{antimony}} oxysulfide is {{also known}} as red antimony (Sb2S2O) [...] The mineral’s color ranges from cherry red to a dark red to a black. <b>Kermesite</b> is the result of partial oxidation between stibnite (Sb2S3) and other antimony oxides such as valentinite (Sb2O3) or stibiconite (Sb3O6(OH)). Under certain conditions with oxygenated fluids the transformation of all sulfur to oxygen would occur but <b>kermesite</b> occurs when that transformation is halted.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Kermesite</b> or red {{antimony}} {{has been}} used as early as the Old Kingdom’s 6th Dynasty in ancient Egypt (c. 2345-2181 BCE) in lip cosmetics and in the 18th Dynasty Queen Hatshepsut (Maatkare) (1498-1483 BCE) negotiated with the Land of Punt for its colored antimony deposits. Besides stibnite, which was used for eye liner red, antimony {{is one of the oldest}} minerals used in cosmetics. Further archaeological evidence indicates that antimony levels were higher in ancient Egyptian female remains which had exposure to both antimony compounds (Bencze, 1994). Because of its color, the precipitate of <b>kermesite</b> was used as a coloring agent and in alchemy. Because of alchemy’s focus on material transformation as evidenced by color, red antimony was used to produce the red state. <b>Kermesite</b> is the mineral state for Kermes mineral which was used extensively in the medical field for centuries ...|$|E

50|$|Presently, <b>kermesite</b> is {{collected}} for {{the beauty of}} its crystal metallic structure and not used in either cosmetics or the medical field any longer due to the toxic effects that it shares with antimony; less harmful substitutes have been found using both organic and pharmaceutical production.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Kermesite</b> {{is named}} after a {{formerly}} used red dye, kermes (dye), and was so named because of the grainy reddish color the mineral often has. The name dates from 1832.

5000|$|The Black Moon Clan members {{follow the}} pattern of the Dark Kingdom of using {{minerals}} as namesakes. Four key figures of the Clan use the four precious stones: ruby, emerald, sapphire and diamond. The Ayakashi Sisters are named after minerals <b>kermesite,</b> berthierite, petzite and calaverite. The Boule Brothers do not follow this pattern; instead, they are named after the scientific terms chirality and achirality. However, the term 'boule' (sounded out in katakana) is accompanied by the kanji '人造宝石', literally meaning a [...] "man-made gemstone"; synthetic/artificial gemstones; and the English term 'boule' means [...] "A single crystal ingot produced by synthetic means".|$|E

Tako se npr. balkanski turcizam grimiz, točnije purpur ili grecizam porfir (grč. porphýra, lat. purpura), povezuje se s malakonimom volak (Murex brandaris) koji u Boki kotorskoj dobiva prepoznatljivu formu prpor i prmpor. Purpur se kod starih pisaca inače prevodi kao crvak. Značenjsku vezu crv  crveno uočavamo u riječi črvit (Rab), čarvit (Susak) “mastiti jaja, robu [...] . ”. Na Ižu “crv” i “prašak za bojanje tkanine” - črv, dem. črvić i črvak, črvilo. Posljednji primjer odvodi nas do ribarskog termina krka (Korčula), korka (Dubrovnik), što je dalmatski leksički ostatak od lat. cortex (kora) > tal. corteccia (còrtice) - “kora koja služi ribarima za tanganje mreža”. U vrbničkom govoru na otoku Krku potvrđen je arhaični pridjev črmni (črman) černi u značenju “crvenkasto-žut, narančast”. This article {{discusses}} {{a variety}} of terms for the red dyes used on the eastern coast of the Adriatic in the fi fteenth century, their etymology and application based on archival documents, ethnological records, literary writings, dictionaries and many other sources. Special {{attention is paid to}} the substance in the Latin sources commonly referred to as chermisium (cremexinum and similar forms), and in the Cyrillic documents as crvac. According to the evidence, it was imported from Bosnia and Serbia and exported to Italy, its main use being for dying fabrics in the Dubrovnik workshops. As to the actual nature of this substance, the historians tended to {{follow in the footsteps of}} K. Jireček, who erroneously described it as a mineral product imported from the Balkan mines (antimony trioxide and trisulphide from the mineral <b>Kermesite).</b> The fi rst to come forward with a thesis that crvac is an organic substance was Sima M. Ćirković. Although he could not determine its exact nature, he found a contract from which it was evident that the substance was ‘collected’. Some Ragusan contracts contain details which testify to the organic origin of crvac, as the latter was to be ripe (staxionatus), dry (siccus), purifi ed (nitidus). Actually described is a scale insect known as Coccus ilicis, a pest of the Mediterranean oak (Quercus ilex). While laying eggs, the female insects remain inactive for a few months, and that is when they are collected. After being dried in the sun, a fi ne powder material is obtained. One hundred and forty thousand insects are needed for one kilogram of powder. Thus it is not surprising that in 1440 at the Dubrovnik market one libra of Coccus was traded for almost one ducat. In Ragusan documents crvac is mentioned from the 1440 s onwards. In the latter half of the fi fteenth century it is rarely mentioned, which may be accounted by the recession in the hinterland due to the Ottoman invasion. More important was the fact that the production of cloth in Dubrovnik witnessed a decline, forcing the Ragusans to seek new, more lucrative economic activities...|$|E
