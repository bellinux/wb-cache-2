While exporters often use Open Account (OA) terms to secure international contracts and to expand export levels, these terms in turn make them face more non-payment risks. In <b>Export</b> Credit <b>Insurance</b> and Trade Promotion, we present a theoretical model showing the competitiveness of OA terms in international trade, and the risk-reducing as well as export-enhancing role played by <b>export</b> credit <b>insurance</b> programs. Our theoretical analysis shows that, when exporters are risk averse, these programs are always effective without breaking the legal and financial obligations. Using Chinese <b>export</b> and <b>insurance</b> data, both static and dynamic models show a positive and statistically significant export-promoting effect of <b>export</b> credit <b>insurance</b> in China.

40|$|Companies face various risks when {{participating}} in international business. Even though exporting {{has been argued}} to represent low level of international commitment, exporters still face more risks in comparison to companies with purely domestic business activities. Among different risks lies credit risk which refers to possible non-payment or late payment of a customer. While exporters’ credit management is responsible for controlling credit risk, credit management in an international environment requires exporters to cope with incomplete information about customers’ creditworthiness and risks related to customers’ home countries. Even though there are various ways to conduct credit management, exporters may choose to acquire <b>export</b> credit <b>insurance</b> to support their credit management practices. By acquiring <b>export</b> credit <b>insurance,</b> exporters can hedge credit risk to credit insurers. This mitigates exporters’ {{exposure to credit risk}} if their customers fail to pay for purchased goods or services i. e. in case when credit risk realizes. This study explored exporters’ views on the value that <b>export</b> credit <b>insurance</b> provides for credit management practices. In this study, value refers to the benefit or benefits that <b>export</b> credit <b>insurance</b> provides. Theoretical background of the study includes literature relating to themes such as <b>export</b> credit <b>insurance,</b> credit management and risks related to internationalization. The study applied a qualitative research approach through five expert interviews from two Finnish exporters and one private export credit insurer. Expert interviews were considered as the most suitable method to collect data in order to create in-depth understanding of an underresearched topic, compare interviewees’ perceptions with current literature as well as to reveal new perceptions towards the value that <b>export</b> credit <b>insurance</b> provides for exporters and their credit management. Based on the existing literature and empirical research, it can be concluded that exporters see that <b>export</b> credit <b>insurance</b> provides value mainly through risk transfer. Risk transfer may also enable exporters to gain additional benefits such as expanding export sales to destinations where they have not sold before. In addition, <b>export</b> credit <b>insurance</b> can enable exporters to outsource a part of their credit management to credit insurers and to provide clear guidelines for exporters that have sufficient resources for independent credit management practices. On the contrary, it seems that exporters’ value perceptions towards <b>export</b> credit <b>insurance</b> are dependent on the extent of insurance coverage that exporters have for their customer base. At the same time, exporters may easily question the premise of <b>export</b> credit <b>insurance</b> if the level of customer non-payments is low...|$|R

The government were accused, by Labour TD Pat Rabbitte, of providing <b>export</b> <b>insurance</b> to him in respect of his sale of beef in Iraq and in effect, giving him favourable treatment. When {{the results of the}} tribunal were published it uncovered many serious malpractices in the industry. The report also cleared the taoiseach of any wrongdoing and stated; “There is no evidence to suggest that either the Taoiseach at the time or the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time was personally close to Mr. Goodman or that Mr. Goodman had any political associations with either of them or the party that they represented.”The McCracken Tribunal of 1997 investigated reports of secret payments by Ben Dunne to former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey and former cabinet minister Michael Lowry. This tribunal found that Haughey had given untrue evidence under oath and that Lowry was knowingly assisted by Dunne in evading tax. When this was made public, the tribunal attempted to initiate criminal proceedings against both men, but failed when it was judged that Haughey would not get a fair trial due to prejudicial comments by Tánaiste Mary Harney. The Moriarty Tribunal of 1997 was a follow up from the McCracken Tribunal which was an inquiry into the financial affairs of politicians Charles Haughey and Michael Lowry.
