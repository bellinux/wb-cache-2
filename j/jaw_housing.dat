50|$|Skorpiovenators skull was short, stout {{and covered}} in the ridges, furrows, tubercles and bumpy nodules that are {{scattered}} {{over the heads of}} most abelisaurid theropods. Its slender <b>jaws</b> <b>housed</b> rows of razor-sharp teeth. Skorpiovenator may not have had a large bite force, as has been suggested for some other abelisaurids. Skorpiovenator may have used its deep skull as a club, arching its head back and swinging it down onto its prey to drive the teeth home with enough force to do some serious damage to its prey.|$|R
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) looks chunky {{and has a}} long condyloid {{process at}} its back; that of T.talamancae is more slender. The capsular process, a projection {{at the back of}} the <b>jaw</b> which <b>houses</b> the root of the lower incisor, is poorly developed.|$|R
50|$|The {{historic}} Moose <b>Jaw</b> Court <b>House</b> {{building is}} located in downtown Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada. The building is 2 storeys; making use of steel construction, hydraulic pressed brick and Bedford Stone trimmed with Indiana Limestone. The building is the oldest continuously functioning provincial court house in the province. The building has been designated a National Historic Site of Canada and a Provincial Heritage Property.|$|R
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) is {{long and}} low. The coronoid process, the frontmost of the three main processes (projections) {{at the back of}} the jawbone, is large and about as high as the condyloid process behind it. The angular process, below the condyloid, is fairly short and does not extend further backwards than the condyloid. There is no noticeable capsular process (a raising {{at the back of the}} <b>jaw</b> that <b>houses</b> the root of the lower incisor).|$|R
50|$|John Leroy Skoberg (February 2, 1926 - August 12, 2012) was a Canadian politician. A {{member of}} the New Democratic Party, he {{represented}} the electoral district of Moose <b>Jaw</b> in the <b>House</b> of Commons from 1968 to 1972, and Moose Jaw North in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan from 1975 to 1982. He died aged 86 in 2012 of dementia.|$|R

Her other film credits include The Impossible Years (1968), <b>Jaws</b> 2 (1978), <b>House</b> (1986), The Verne Miller Story (1987), Flatliners (1990) and Younger and Younger (1993). Her last film role was in the live-action version of Fist of the North Star (1995). She also played the main character in a Remington Steele episode ("Love Among the Steele", 1983).|$|R
5000|$|Rhamphorhynchus ( [...] , [...] "beak snout") is a genus of long-tailed pterosaurs in the Jurassic period. Less {{specialized}} than contemporary, short-tailed pterodactyloid pterosaurs such as Pterodactylus, {{it had a}} long tail, stiffened with ligaments, {{which ended}} in a characteristic diamond-shaped vane. The <b>jaws</b> of Rhamphorhynchus <b>housed</b> needle-like teeth, which were angled forward, with a curved, sharp, beak-like tip lacking teeth, indicating a diet mainly of fish; indeed, fish and cephalopod remains are frequently found in Rhamphorhynchus abdominal contents, {{as well as in}} their coprolites.|$|R
50|$|Caryonosuchus {{is known}} {{only from the}} holotype {{specimen}} DGM 1411-R, a nearly complete anterior portion of the skull and lower <b>jaw</b> which <b>housed</b> at the Earth Science Museum of the Departamento Nacional da Produção Mineral. A cast is housed at the Departamento de Geologia, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. It was found near Presidente Prudente City of southwest São Paulo State. It was collected from the Adamantina Formation of the Bauru Basin, which dates to the Campanian and Maastrichtian stages of the Late Cretaceous. DGM 1411-R was briefly mentioned before the description of Caryonosuchus. For example, Kellner & Campos (1999) tentatively assigned it to Sphagesaurus sp., however newly described cranial sphagesaurid remains may suggest that the type species of the family, Sphagesaurus huenei, is a nomen dubium. Thus, DGM 1411-R {{is regarded as a}} new genus and species.|$|R
50|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} {{the front}} {{part of the}} palate, do not extend between the molars. The palate ends beyond the third molars and is perforated by posterolateral palatal pits there. Behind it, {{the roof of the}} mesopterygoid fossa is perforated by poorly developed sphenopalatine vacuities. The auditory bullae, which house the inner ear, are large. Usually, the mastoid bone lacks openings (fenestrae), which are present in T. talamancae. The pattern of the arteries in the head is primitive, as indicated by the condition of various foramina (openings) and grooves in the skull.The mandible (lower jaw) looks chunky and has a long condyloid process at its back; that of T. talamancae is more slender. The capsular process, a projection {{at the back of the}} <b>jaw</b> which <b>houses</b> the root of the lower incisor, is poorly developed.|$|R
50|$|Yulong {{is based}} on a syntype series of five specimens: HGM 41HIII-0107: an {{exceptionally}} well-preserved skeleton with a skull and lower <b>jaws</b> that is <b>housed</b> in the Henan Geological Museum, only lacking the skull and the neck base; HGM 41HIII-0108: a skull lacking the lower jaws; HGM 41HIII-0109: a partial skeleton with skull and lower jaws; HGM 41HIII-0110: a partial skull with lower jaws and some neck vertebrae; and HGM 41HIII-0111: a left ilium. Additional finds have been mentioned in the describing paper. One exceptionally preserved embryo (within an egg) is HGM 41HIII-0301, which came from a nest of 26 eggs.|$|R
50|$|Eohyosaurus {{is known}} solely from the holotype SAM-PK-K10159, a partial skull missing the front end, with {{associated}} incomplete lower <b>jaws</b> currently <b>housed</b> at the Iziko South African Museum, Cape Town. The specimen {{was discovered by}} Frederik Petrus Wolvaardt in December 2000, loose on boulder-strewn slopes {{at the base of}} a cliff, at Farm Lemoenfontein 44, Rouxville District of the Free State Province. It was collected from the middle deposits of the Burgersdorp Formation of Beaufort Group. This horizon belongs to Subzone B of the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone, dating to the early Anisian stage of the early Middle Triassic period, about 246 million years ago. Farm Lemoenfontein 44 also yielded remains of the archosauriform Erythrosuchus africanus, the bauriid Microgomphodon oligocynus, the cynodont Trirachodon, the kannemeyeriid Kannemeyeria as well as unidentified procolophonid remains. All known basal rhynchosaurs came from similar deposits in the Beaufort Group, and while Howesia browni and Mesosuchus browni are also known from Subzone B of Burgersdorp Formation (from different localities), Noteosuchus colletti is known from the earliest Triassic Katberg Formation (Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone).|$|R
5|$|The {{skull of}} Voalavo also {{resembles that of}} Eliurus, with a long facial skeleton, an hourglass-shaped interorbital region (between the eyes), and a smooth interorbital region and braincase, without ridges or shelves. Other shared {{characteristics}} include an essentially featureless bony palate, without many pits and ridges, and a broad mesopterygoid fossa (the opening behind the palate). In other characteristics, Voalavo resembles some but not all species of Eliurus. For example, {{the length of the}} incisive foramina matches the maximum seen in Eliurus species (in this case, in Major's tufted-tailed rat and White-tipped tufted-tailed rat). The back margin of the incisive foramen is rounded in eastern voalavo, but angular in northern voalavo. The two species also differ {{in the shape of the}} suture (dividing line) between the maxillary and palatine bones, which is straight in eastern voalavo, but more curved in northern voalavo. The capsular process, a projection at the back of the mandible (lower <b>jaw)</b> that <b>houses</b> the root of the lower incisor, is indistinct in Voalavo, a feature it shares with Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, Major's tufted-tailed rat, and Petter's tufted-tailed rat, but not the other species of Eliurus.|$|R
5000|$|B. mariantensis {{is known}} from two specimens, {{including}} the holotype UFRGS-PV-0168-T, a complete skull, atlas, axis and third neck vertebra and the paratype UFRGS-PV-0315-T, right maxilla and <b>jaw,</b> both <b>housed</b> at the vertebrate paleontology {{collection of the}} Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre-Brazil. The specimens were collected at the same site, along road RS-240 {{near the town of}} Porto Mariante, 28 km east of Venâncio Aires, in the municipality of Bom Retiro do Sul. Since its first description by Langer & Schultz (2000) it became known in the scientific literature as the [...] "Mariante Rhynchosaur" [...] in reference to the town of Porto Mariante. It was finally named as a new genus and species by Cesar Leandro Schultz, Max Cardoso Langer and Felipe Chinaglia Montefeltro in 2016 as B. mariantensis. The generic name Brasinorhynchus comes from Portuguese brasino used for red horses in south Brazil in reference to the red color of the fossils and their resemblance to a horse skull, and from the Greek rhynchos meaning [...] "beak", a common suffix for rhynchosaur genera. The specific name shares its origin with the specimens' old nickname, the [...] "Mariante Rhynchosaur".|$|R
25|$|The {{skull of}} Sinosaurus {{has a deep}} notch between the premaxilla and maxilla. Dong (2003) {{proposed}} that the notch was used to <b>house</b> <b>jaw</b> muscles, giving Sinosaurus a powerful bite. Based on the estimated power of its jaws, Sinosaurus might have either been a carnivore or a scavenger. Dong suspected that the premaxilla was covered in a narrow, hooked beak, {{that was used to}} rip open skin and abdominal flesh. He also thought that the crest would have been used to hold open the abdominal cavity while feeding. Dong studied the feet of Sinosaurus as well, finding a resemblance with the feet of modern vultures. The feet of Sinosaurus were probably adapted to help it feed on large-bodied animals, such as prosauropods.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{experts believe}} that its <b>jaw</b> may have <b>housed</b> a long tongue, which it would use to pull leaves into its mouth, similar to the modern tree sloth. Others {{question}} this view. Some of the elements in the oral cavity of Megatherium were fused together: a rigidly articulated stylohyal and epihyal, and the apparatus lies farther anteriorly, which together with the elongated, steeply inclined mandibular symphysis, indicates a relatively shorter geniohyoid muscle and thus more limited capacity for tongue protrusion. [...] It was well adapted for strong, predominantly orthal (up-down) movement for eating rough vegetation. Megatherium possessed the narrowest muzzle of all ground sloths from the Pleistocene. This leads paleobiologists {{to believe that it}} was a very selective eater. It had the ability to pick and choose which leaves and twigs it would consume. Megatherium had a large narrow prehensile lip that was capable of grabbing and tearing off particular leaves and twigs and other sorts of vegetation.|$|R
40|$|Mammalian {{dentition}} {{is characterized}} by regional differentiation into incisors, canines, premolars and molars on each jaw quadrant (heterodonty), and single tooth replacement during lifetime (diphyodonty). Despite their significance in mammalian biology and paleontology, {{little is known about}} the developmental mechanisms regulating tooth type determination and diphyodont tooth replacement. The mouse, the most popular laboratory animal, is not appropriate for the investigation of heterodonty and diphyodonty, because of its highly specialized dentition. The house shrew, Suncus murinus, has been implicated to be potentially an excellent model organism to study the mammalian basal condition of tooth development. Using this model organism, the tooth-forming regions for all tooth types have been precisely located in the developing jaws. The expression domain of Bmp 4 /Msx 1 prior to odontogenesis corresponds to the incisor-forming region, whereas that of Fgf 8 /Barx 1 corresponds to the molar-forming region. The model for tooth type determination established in the lower jaw of the mouse, will be applicable to both upper and lower <b>jaws</b> of the <b>house</b> shrew. In addition, the developmental sequence of tooth germs in the house shrew indicates that two adjacent primary enamel knots do not develop simultaneously, but with a constant time lag. This mode of tooth replacement can be explained by a sequential inhibitory cascade from developmentally preceding adjacent tooth germs. On the basis of the new knowledge on tooth development of the house shrew, this article discusses the developmental mechanisms regulating mammalian heterodonty and diphyodonty, and considers future prospects in the field of evolutionary developmental biology. ...|$|R
50|$|Sigournea is a genus of stem {{tetrapod}} {{from the}} Early Carboniferous. The genus contains only one species, the type species Sigournea multidentata, which was named in 2006 by paleontologists John R. Bolt and R. Eric Lombard {{on the basis}} of a single lower jaw from Iowa. The jaw came from a fissure-fill deposit of the St. Louis Limestone that was exposed in a quarry near the town of Sigourney and dates to the Viséan stage, making it approximately 335 million years old. Bolt and Lombard named the genus after Sigourney. The species name multidentata alludes to the many teeth preserved in the jaw. The <b>jaw,</b> which is <b>housed</b> in the Field Museum and cataloged as FM PR 1820, curves strongly downward but was probably straight to begin with, having been deformed by the process of fossilization after the individual died. Rooted in the dentary bone along the outermost edge of the jaw are 88 small, pointed marginal teeth. An additional row of even smaller teeth runs along the coronoids, three bones positioned lengthwise along the lower boundary of the dentary on the inner surface of the lower jaw. Bolt and Lombard were able to classify Sigournea as an early member of Tetrapoda based on the presence of bone surfaces covered in pits and ridges, a single row of dentary teeth, a jaw joint that faces upward, and an open groove for a lateral line along the outer surface of the jaw, and on the absence of teeth on the prearticular bone or enlarged fangs on the coronoids. Sigournea differs from other stem tetrapods in having several holes within a depression called the exomeckelian fenestra on the inner surface of the jaw.|$|R
