5|$|Most gliders do {{not have}} engines or at least engines that would allow a {{take-off}} under their own power. Various methods are therefore used to get airborne. Each method requires specific training, therefore glider pilots must be in current practice {{for the type of}} launch being used. Licensing rules in some countries, such as the USA, differentiate between aerotows and <b>ground</b> <b>launch</b> methods, due to the widely different techniques.|$|E
5|$|Wind figures {{prominently}} in several popular sports, including recreational hang gliding, hot air ballooning, kite flying, snowkiting, kite landboarding, kite surfing, paragliding, sailing, and windsurfing. In gliding, wind gradients {{just above the}} surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider. Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum <b>ground</b> <b>launch</b> tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed {{to deal with the}} effect of the gradient. When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E

Hi-Hoe was also air-launched, however it was released from an F4H Phantom II, which provided greater performance. SIP launches were conducted from a <b>ground</b> <b>launch</b> pad on San Nicolas Island. The aircraft used for the airborne launches took off from Point Arguello, which later became part of Vandenberg Air Force Base.|$|E

It was also responsible for information technology and facility support to the wing. The 694th Armament Systems Squadron was responsible for international sales of all wing weapons systems.

500|$|In early September 1944, a {{detachment}} of the Special Weapons Branch, Wright Field, Ohio, arrived at Wendover with thirteen Republic-Ford JB-2 flying bombs. [...] The JB-2 was a United States {{copy of the}} Nazi V-1 flying bomb, which was reverse-engineered from malfunctioning wrecks of V-1s recovered in England. [...] The United States JB-2 {{was different from the}} German V-1 in only the smallest of dimensions. At Wendover, a launch ramp was constructed for the JB-2, engineered from plans developed from aerial photographs of ramps used by the Germans in the Low Countries. [...] In addition to the <b>ground</b> <b>launch</b> ramp, a B-17 Flying Fortress was modified to be able to carry the jet bomb underneath a wing and air launch it. [...] Numerous tests were conducted and an initial production order was 1,000 units was made by the Army, with subsequent planned production of 1,000 per month. The fortunes of war in Europe in the spring of 1945 led to the decision to use the JB-2 in the Pacific Theater, to be used as part of Operation Downfall, the planned invasion of Japan. The sudden end of the war in September 1945 led to the curtailment of the JB-2 program and the weapon was never used in combat.|$|E
