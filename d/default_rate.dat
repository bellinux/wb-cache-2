25|$|Prepayment/reinvestment/early amortization: The {{majority}} of revolving ABS {{are subject to}} some degree of early amortization risk. The risk stems from specific early amortization events or payout events that cause the security to be paid off prematurely. Typically, payout events include insufficient payments from the underlying borrowers, insufficient excess spread, {{a rise in the}} <b>default</b> <b>rate</b> on the underlying loans above a specified level, a decrease in credit enhancements below a specific level, and bankruptcy {{on the part of the}} sponsor or servicer.|$|E
25|$|Low {{introductory}} {{credit card}} rates {{are limited to}} a fixed term, usually between 6 and 12 months, after which a higher rate is charged. As all credit cards charge fees and interest, some customers become so indebted to their credit card provider that they are driven to bankruptcy. Some credit cards often levy a rate of 20 to 30 percent after a payment is missed. In other cases, a fixed charge is levied without change to the interest rate. In some cases universal default may apply: the high <b>default</b> <b>rate</b> is applied to a card in good standing by missing a payment on an unrelated account from the same provider. This {{can lead to a}} snowball effect in which the consumer is drowned by unexpectedly high interest rates. Further, most card holder agreements enable the issuer to arbitrarily raise the interest rate for any reason they see fit. First Premier Bank at one point offered a credit card with a 79.9% interest rate; however, they discontinued this card in February 2011 because of persistent defaults.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{inspired}} by the Credit Portfolio View approach, we intend to develop an econometric credit risk model to estimate credit loss distributions of Turkish Banking System under baseline and stress macro scenarios, by substituting <b>default</b> <b>rates</b> with non-performing loan (NPL) ratios.

[...] The audit report, issued in March 2000 (herein, the [...] "OIG 2000 report"), concluded that HUD had been allowing the organizations to operate their programs {{in a way that}} circumvented FHA requirements. [...] The stated rationale for this conclusion was the OIG's finding that the assistance was not a [...] "true gift", because the nonprofit organization was being reimbursed by the seller. [...] The OIG also presented evidence that (i) the <b>default</b> <b>rate</b> for persons receiving the assistance was [...] "significantly higher" [...] than the average <b>default</b> <b>rate</b> for other FHA insured loans and (ii) some sellers were raising the sales price of their properties {{to cover the cost of}} the assistance, thus requiring the homebuyers to finance higher loan amounts.

[...] As a result of the higher perceived risk, the differential in yield of the junk bond market over U.S. treasuries (known as the [...] "spread") had also increased by 700 basis points (7 percentage points).

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} measuring rating consistency, and more specifically, it evaluates the reliability of historical <b>default</b> <b>rates</b> as estimates of the true underlying default probabilities associated with Moody's ratings. The article also provides some technical guidance to interpret differences in historical annual <b>default</b> <b>rates</b> across bond market sectors. Finally, it concludes with three case studies {{that are designed to}} illustrate the usefulness of these methods for comparing the historical <b>default</b> <b>rates</b> of different bond market sectors. Based upon this work, we make the following observations:. Rating consistency cannot reliably be measured by a single variable, but rather should be measured against the multiple attributes of credit risk [...] -including default probability and loss severity. Moreover, consistency with respect to historical <b>default</b> <b>rates</b> needs to be measured for different horizons. Consistency over longer investment horizons is more central to the meaning of Moody's ratings than consistency over shorter investment horizons.. Differences in historical <b>default</b> <b>rates</b> can indeed be subjected to rigorous tests of statistical significance, but such tests must incorporate the volatility and persistence of macroeconomic and sectoral shocks. The presence of macroeconomic and sectoral shocks means that historical <b>default</b> <b>rates</b> may vary across bond market sectors for fairly long periods of time without necessarily implying fundamental differences in underlying default probabilities. Nevertheless, the observed historical volatility of these shocks suggests reasonable limits on expected differences in observed <b>default</b> <b>rates.</b> Therefore, consistency can be rigorously tested along this particular dimension of credit risk..

We find that prepayment rates increase rapidly with loan age but are not affected by prevailing market interest <b>rates.</b> <b>Default</b> <b>rates</b> are much more sensitive to aggregate shocks than are prepayment rates. Increases in unemployment precede increases in <b>default</b> <b>rates,</b> suggesting that <b>defaults</b> on subprime automobile loans are driven largely by shocks to household liquidity.
