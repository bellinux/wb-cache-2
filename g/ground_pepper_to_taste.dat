40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{chemical}} and organoleptical properties of hot red pepper grown in GAP region in Southeast of Turkey were investigated. Four types of hot red <b>peppers</b> (A-Industrial red <b>ground</b> <b>pepper,</b> B-Industrial deep-red/ blackish <b>ground</b> <b>pepper,</b> C-Traditional deep-red/ blackish <b>ground</b> <b>pepper</b> sold {{in the market and}} D-Traditional deep-red/ blackish <b>ground</b> <b>pepper</b> consumed in home only) that were produced from the same pepper variety were taken for analyses.

No significant differences between test samples were found in terms of chemical properties. Sample A had the highest level of invert sugar (20. 8 %), {{while the rest of the}} samples gave close values to each other. The industrial samples (samples A and B) had higher extractable colour (as ASTA unit) and pungency (as Scoville index) values than their traditional counterparts.
