500|$|Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several {{prominent}} directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre {{for a private}} screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to {{give them a chance to}} see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E

I was smiling and I was dancing, and I was living through this music." [...] As with her earlier recordings and many of her performances, Bear donates a portion of all proceeds to charity. In July 2013 {{she was part of}} a few Quincy Jones 80th birthday concerts in Montreux, Switzerland, Seoul, South Korea and in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{did receive}} {{some level of}} criticism, though. thenewreview.net stated [...] "With songs like 'Ride Insane' 'Here and Now' and 'Nowhere', I became a little bored. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were {{listening}} to songs I had already heard before by the band, or perhaps even elsewhere, and wasn’t completely blown away by what was there." [...] Guitarinternational.com stated [...] "Cold Day Memory is a killer release, and one that should act to propel the band into the new decade with {{a renewed sense of}} confidence, hopefully forgetting, at least somewhat, the events that haunted them {{for the majority of the}} past decade. If this record is any indication of things to come, then we could be hearing great things from a band that has more than paid their dues, and come screaming back onto the scene, leaving no doubt that they deserve to be included next to the biggest names in Metal today." ...|$|E
60|$|Still I {{could not}} speak. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{the whole affair}} were a dream, and looked on and listened with a vacant smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "No indeed!" [...] I exclaimed earnestly. And indeed <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{one could}} not easily tire of the sweet sadness of that gentle voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just the same, both one {{and other}} of us," [...] he replied. [...] "Before you spoke six words <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> we'd parted only yesterday." ...|$|R
2500|$|He {{was posted}} on {{attachment}} to the 3rd The King's Own Hussars, which was serving in the North African Campaign at the time, and joined the regiment {{just in time for}} the beginning of Operation Compass. This was a British offensive against Italian forces in North Africa, which began in December, 1940, and participated in the Battle of Sidi Barrani. In the aftermath of one battle, he was detailed to supervise a burial party and came across a damaged Italian tank, its entire crew dead; unable to recover the bodies, Farran set the tank's petrol tank on fire. After Operation Compass came to an end, the Hussars were transferred to the island of Crete, to reinforce the British and Commonwealth forces that were stationed there after their retreat from Greece. Farran was attached to the regiment's 'C' Squadron, which was located several miles west of Canea when the Germans began their invasion of Crete on 20 May 1941. Farran was ordered to take a troop of tanks and block a road that led from the village of Galatas, and shortly afterwards sighted and killed a number of German troops escorting a group of 40 captured hospital patients. The troop came under attack from Stukas and well hidden ground forces. Returning from this mission Farran's troop encountered several Germans who attempted to surrender; he ordered them shot, later writing that the incident occurred in the heat of the moment. [...] On 21 May, the 10th Infantry Brigade launched a successful assault on Cemetery Hill, in which Farran participated. German forces were eventually able to break through the British and Commonwealth positions around Galatas, and Farran was part of a counter-attack in an attempt to retake the village. He protested about the unsuitability of his light tanks for the task but was told that no heavy tanks were left. Farran later wrote of his guilt at allowing the dangerous lead position to be taken by a subordinate -"I did not care for orders when it suited me, but this time I had chosen to obey them because I knew that I would be killed if I did not. I should have been in that leading tank. Instead, there was Skedgewell dead and his pretty young wife waiting at home. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had murdered him." [...] During the action he was wounded in the right arm and both of his legs, and as a result he was captured by German forces. It was at this time that he was awarded the Military Cross, for gallantry during his service in Crete.|$|E
60|$|After {{that his}} voice grew faint, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were walking in a dream.|$|E
60|$|He {{stopped to}} kiss me on the forehead, and I sobbed and wept afresh. For <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could not bear the painful delight of his praise.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I should so {{much like}} to.' <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> indeed it would relieve {{me to be able}} to confide in somebody, I wanted sympathy so badly.|$|R
60|$|From that moment, {{whenever}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it {{was impossible}} to take another step, I looked at Darius, and forced myself to forget weariness or hunger.|$|R
60|$|In a word, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were my {{duty and}} {{obligation}} {{to go with}} them. My guardian did not seek to dissuade me, and I went.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I couldn't help it,' again {{said the}} girl. 'The river noise was so like everything--and I knew the way--and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> must go before any one was up.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{earth was}} praising God that Sunday as I rode to Mr. Bordley's. And {{as it is}} sorrow which lifts us nearest to heaven, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were in church.|$|E
6000|$|... "If He's {{as good as}} {{your father}} He'll do for me," [...] said Mary. [...] "When your father was talking to me <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> never could be bad any more." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{she clung}} so closely about me, {{that it seemed}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I could never escape out of her arms, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> my heart must break in twain.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{an awful}} charm was framing round and {{gathering}} over me: I trembled {{to hear some}} fatal word spoken which would at once declare and rivet the spell.|$|R
60|$|So slow, so eager, so bloodless and gaunt, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Richard were wasting away {{beneath the}} eyes of this adviser and there were {{something}} of the vampire in him.|$|R
6000|$|I had {{no sooner}} spoken than I repented of my words; he grew so pale that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had struck him. [...] "Ah, 'lived'--!" [...] he murmured, turning short away from me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ostrog has discipline--he has plans. Do you know, {{out there}} just now I felt--. When I heard that these {{aeroplanes}} were a stage nearer. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were fighting {{the machinery of}} fate." ...|$|E
6000|$|I had {{no sooner}} spoken than I repented of my words; he grew so pale that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had struck him. [...] "Ah, 'lived'-- !" [...] he murmured, turning short away from me.|$|E
60|$|For {{a reason}} that <b>I</b> had, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> my eyes would start out of my head. I {{acknowledged}} his attention incoherently, and began to {{think this was a}} dream.|$|R
60|$|He left me, and I {{returned}} to my old position. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a sheet of lead were pressing upon my head. A moment later a gruff voice broke in upon me.|$|R
60|$|He was {{jingling}} some keys in his pocket. It was a {{habit of}} his when cross-examining, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> somehow <b>I</b> knew; and, without thinking--so it seemed to me--I answered him.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{had stepped}} on {{the place where the}} last stair ought to have been, but wasn't. I felt defiant, if you know what I mean, and there didn't seem {{anything}} to defy.|$|E
60|$|After {{two days}} and nights, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had lived there for a year, and yet I was not an hour older, but was quite as much tormented by my own youthfulness as ever.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well, if {{you don't}} call that scandylos——!' said old Ma Stainwright, and Meg began to cry. You don't know, Cyril! She sobbed fit to break her heart. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{could have killed}} him.|$|E
5000|$|... "In 1949, when I {{first saw}} the glacier, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all my sins were washed away and I had truly {{attained}} rebirth. But now, {{it is impossible to}} experience that Ganga of the past." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is good," [...] Osgod said, {{after taking}} a mighty draught. [...] "Truly <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the {{moisture}} of my body had all dried up, and not only my mouth but my whole frame was parched." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{echoed the}} hope, but I {{remember}} well the impression this made upon me--my immediate pang of resentment, a disgust almost equal to Flora's own. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a great rare sapphire had split in my hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "He--he sort of {{degraded}} me. He {{wanted to}} bully {{me because he}} hadn't got me. And then <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wanted to run, as if I was fastened and bound up. And he seemed dirty." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} make Pearse's point of view clear. Before this old man, with his {{inflexible}} will and sense of duty, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> held a brief for Zachary, and must try to do him justice.|$|E
6000|$|... "I used {{to think}} many years would be burdensome, and just before I came here <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could not bear another one. But now I like to live, and hope I shall a long, long time." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it {{were all}} a dream, and when {{presently}} my brother came {{and took my}} hand, I cried out: 'Oh, wake me! Wake me!' And when he burst into tears I asked what he meant.|$|R
60|$|I do {{not know}} if I was looking <b>as</b> amazed <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt.</b> <b>I</b> hope not, for <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> my brain were giving way. The perfect calmness with which she spoke of this {{extraordinary}} freak added to my confusion.|$|R
3000|$|... “At the beginning, I {{was scared}} {{in the group}} {{meetings}} because {{of the difference in}} age between me and other fellow members. But after a while, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were my age group; because they were friendly”.|$|R
