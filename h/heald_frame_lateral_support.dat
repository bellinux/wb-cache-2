For {{reducing}} <b>heald</b> <b>frame’s</b> vibration {{and noise}} {{in the process of}} weaving, composite of Carbon-Fibre was applied to it, and three methods of lay up for laminate was designed in the paper. Finite element model of the <b>heald</b> <b>frame</b> was set up, and element shell 181 was used to simulate different layers of the composite material, then some important natural frequencies and vibration modes were calculated, and the results of that was compared with another <b>heald</b> <b>frame</b> made of aluminium alloy. The analysis result indicated that, the second method for laying had an optimum dynamic characteristics, based on that, fundamental frequency of the <b>heald</b> <b>frame</b> was increased by 19. 48 Hz, and self-weight of it was lightened about 26. 82 %. In results, lightweight design of the <b>heald</b> <b>frame</b> was come true, at the same time, vibration resistance of it was also strengthened effectively...|$|R

40|$|Shedding is {{the first}} primary motions of loom. It is done by raising and {{lowering}} the <b>Heald</b> <b>frames.</b> The <b>heald</b> <b>frames</b> on a loom are positioned {{side by side with}} a little distance as possible. The different positions of <b>heald</b> <b>frame</b> causes the variation in distance from cloth fell to peek of shed. In the present paper, the effect ofthis positional variation upon warp yarns, fabric properties and most importantly the whole weaving procedure have been concentrated. To find out the significance of this effect, two categories of fabric was produced using same weave (combination of plain and twill) but changing drafting plan. In the first category, the warp yarnshaving plain weave were threaded to <b>heald</b> <b>frames</b> nearest to the cloth fell and the other portion of warp yarns having twill weave were threaded farthest to the cloth fell. The drafting plan of second category was reverse the first category. All the other parameters were same in both cases. During weaving, weaving performances wasobserved and recorded in both cases. Later, crimp% of plain and twill portion of both fabrics were measured by Tautex Digital Crimp Tester and yarn strength of plain and twill portion of both samples were measured by Titan universal strength tester. It was observed that selecting <b>heald</b> <b>frame</b> position have substantial effect on crimp%,yarn strength and fabric performance. It is expected that this study will be help full to increase weaving performance and ensure better fabric quality in case of producing fancy weave...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to eliminate the residual vibration of shedding system and the associated mechanism that connects the heddle shafts with the cam mechanisms. Effective cam design method which is based on motion design of the cam pitch curve by “blends ” of the traditional profiles, formed by superimposing three functions; a cycloid, a ramped versine, and a ramp called as ramp-plus-ramped cycloid-plus-ramped versine is proposed in this study. This function is reshaped using the system’s natural frequency and damping ratio to yield almost zero residual vibration of the heddle shaft. The proposed method is then compared with the well known cam curves and its applicability is shown by simulation and experimental results. The results show that the proposed method is quite effective for fast vibration free motion of the <b>heald</b> <b>frame...</b>|$|R
50|$|Shedding. Shedding is {{the raising}} of part of the warp yarn to form a shed (the {{vertical}} space between the raised and unraised warp yarns), through which the filling yarn, carried by the shuttle, can be inserted. On the modern loom, simple and intricate shedding operations are performed automatically by the heddle or <b>heald</b> <b>frame,</b> {{also known as a}} harness. This is a rectangular frame to which a series of wires, called heddles or healds, are attached. The yarns are passed through the eye holes of the heddles, which hang vertically from the harnesses. The weave pattern determines which harness controls which warp yarns, and the number of harnesses used depends on the complexity of the weave. Two common methods of controlling the heddles are dobbies and a Jacquard Head.|$|R

30|$|Therefore, <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> and <b>support</b> <b>frames</b> were {{designed}} using a ball caster and circular rod, shown in Fig.  2. The circular support rod can move laterally {{to adjust the}} width of the beam and is fastened to act as a <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> condition. The ball caster, which is in contact with the side surface of the top and bottom flanges of the beam, contains grease to minimize friction resistance at the contact surface of the ball caster and the circular rod. The top and bottom ball casters, which provide <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> to the top and bottom flanges of the beam, respectively, is free to move up and down, as well as rotate when the rotations about the strong and weak axes occur in the beam. Therefore, the in-plane and out-of-plane rotations of a beam are unconstrained at the support locations.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that weaving mills become noisy with {{increasing}} speed of a jet loom. One of the authors used the <b>heald</b> <b>frames</b> equipped with bar magnets {{in order to reduce the}} heald vibration, and reported that the disorder of the heald motion during shedding motion was improved. Then, sound heard by human ears seemed reduced, but there was no significant difference in the noise level measured with the noise-level meter. In this report, therefore, the high response sound measuring system was arranged in order to obtain the time chart of sound pressure level caused by healds during shedding motion. High-speed video-camera was also used in order to observe the healds motion. It was clarified that the noise was significantly connected with healds motion during shedding motion. Large sound occurred in two cases : when healds collided with the heald bar vertically near the upper dead point of shedding motion and when healds collided at random by rebounds around the lower dead point of shedding motion...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of the existing design solution of shedding mechanism. It is characterised by a heald attachment into the heald shaft with a necessary design allowance. The preparation of a mathematical model for the new concept of the heald attaching to the <b>heald</b> shaft <b>frame</b> is explained in this study. A damping element for dissipating the energy created during the heald impact on the carrying wire of the heald shaft is currently used for the high-speed weaving loom. This system makes use of a damping element, fitted in the profile of the rod at an optimum distance from heald eye. This element provides for reduction of the heald velocity before its drop upon the supporting wire because the opposite section of the heald is pressed into the rubber element. The calculated results of the new concept of the heald attaching to the <b>heald</b> shaft <b>frame</b> are compared with the existing solution without application of the damping element...|$|R

50|$|Compared {{to running}} shoes, {{badminton}} shoes have little <b>lateral</b> <b>support.</b> High levels of <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> {{are useful for}} activities where lateral motion is undesirable and unexpected. Badminton, however, requires powerful lateral movements. A highly built-up <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> {{will not be able}} to protect the foot in badminton; instead, it will encourage catastrophic collapse at the point where the shoe's support fails, and the player's ankles are not ready for the sudden loading, which can cause sprains. For this reason, players should choose badminton shoes rather than general trainers or running shoes, because proper badminton shoes will have a very thin sole, lower a person's centre of gravity, and therefore result in fewer injuries. Players should also ensure that they learn safe and proper footwork, with the knee and foot in alignment on all lunges. This is more than just a safety concern: proper footwork is also critical in order to move effectively around the court.|$|R
40|$|The Gemini {{primary mirror}} support {{incorporates}} {{a system of}} hydraulic whiffletrees to carry the mirror weight and define its position. The six orthogonal kinematic degrees of freedom are controlled by six hydraulic zones [...] three axial, two lateral, plus a transverse lateral. By varying the fluid volumes in these hydraulic zones the mirror position can be adjusted in all six degrees of freedom. Because of the finite lengths of the linkages that connect the mirror to the <b>lateral</b> <b>supports,</b> any shift in mirror position changes the amplitudes and directions of the applied forces with a resulting effect on the static balance and mirror figure. These effects have been calculated for mirror translations and rotations in all six degrees of freedom, resulting in predictions {{of the changes in}} the axial and <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> forces and in the mirror figure.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} gabled {{hyperbolic}} paraboloid shells (gabled hypar) revealed that shell loads are {{transferred to the}} supports mainly through diagonal arch action, and the contribution of edge beams, which have been traditionally included based on the assumptions of membrane theory, is actually very limited. This finding introduced a new shape of gabled hypars in which the edge beams are removed. This paper investigated the behaviors of gabled hypars with and without edge beams for various cases considering the effects of rise-to-span ratio (RSR) and <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> movement. The FE analyses results indicated that, when the RSR was low, distribution of shell stress showed large variations. <b>Lateral</b> <b>support</b> movement caused an increase of tensile stresses, a decrease of compressive stresses, and intensified stress variation. When edge beams were not used, deflections were increased substantially, and local fluctuation of stress {{in the vicinity of}} the supports was intensified. Such behaviors were aggravated when RSR was low and proper constraints against the <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> movement were not provided, thus resulting in inefficient systems. As such, gabled hypars without edge beams should be designed with caution...|$|R

Analysis, supported by experimentation, indicates a period of noneroding penetration for these configurations, which results from <b>lateral</b> <b>support</b> exerted by the target crater upon the deforming, yet noneroding, penetrator. Experiments indicate that the magnitude of the <b>lateral</b> <b>support,</b> the direct result of an interference fit between rod and crater, must be on the order of the target’s ballistic-penetration resistance, and does not vary with the impact velocity over the range studied. Analysis suggests that the duration of the noneroding portion of the ballistic event is neither governed by a fixed time, nor by a fixed depth of penetration, but rather by a fixed, permissible level of deformation in the penetrator...|$|R

Children with disabilities have difficulty using today's seesaws because they consist of only a seat and a handle on each side. It requires that the user has strong arms and legs and can sit up without support. HAGS Aneby AB would like to change this. To gain knowledge of the target group and on the different types of disabilities information was sought for on the internet including the RBU's and UNICEF's websites. During implementation several concepts was developed and screened off to finally get the final result. Methods such as QFD, feasibility assessment and Go/No-Go-screening have been implemented. The instructions in the safety standard EN 1176 has been closely followed {{in the development of the}} seesaw.
