We apply the method to obtain the phase diagrams of the random-bond Ising model and q-state Potts <b>gauge</b> <b>glasses.</b> In the Ising case, the Nishimori point is found at p_N = 0. 10929 ± 0. 00002, in agreement with and improving on the precision of existing numerical estimations.

50|$|Sheet mica is used principally in the {{electronic}} and electrical industries. Its usefulness in these applications is derived from its unique electrical and thermal properties and its mechanical properties, which {{allow it to be}} cut, punched, stamped, and machined to close tolerances. Specifically, mica is unusual in that it is a good electrical insulator {{at the same time as}} being a good thermal conductor. The leading use of block mica is as an electrical insulator in electronic equipment. High-quality block mica is processed to line the <b>gauge</b> <b>glasses</b> of high-pressure steam boilers because of its flexibility, transparency, and resistance to heat and chemical attack. Only high-quality muscovite film mica, which is variously called India ruby mica or ruby muscovite mica, is used as a dielectric in capacitors. The highest quality mica film is used to manufacture capacitors for calibration standards. The next lower grade is used in transmitting capacitors. Receiving capacitors use a slightly lower grade of high-quality muscovite.|$|R

50|$|Early {{designers}} fitted curved sheets {{below the}} steam collector pipe, {{but these were}} not successful as {{the whole of the}} steam space could contain foam. In districts where the feed water is unsuitable, blowdown valves ("scum valves"), either continuously working while the regulator is open or operated in conjunction with the boiler feed, are fitted. Valves at water level reduce surface scum; those towards the bottom of the boiler help remove precipitated solids. Other forms of prevention include the chemical treatment of water before it enters the boiler. In the event of priming (and also when steam is admitted through cold piping or into a cold cylinder) the operators need to open the cylinder cocks, which are designed to release trapped water. Once occurring, the problem can affect the level indicated in the boiler's <b>gauge</b> <b>glass</b> and for this reason is difficult to put right without reducing the water level {{to the extent that the}} firebox crown becomes dangerously exposed.|$|E
50|$|The process {{starts with}} a “blowdown” while some {{pressure}} remains in the boiler, then the draining away of all the boiler water through the “mudholes” {{at the base of}} the firebox and the removal of all the “washout plugs”. Scale is then jetted or scraped from the interior surfaces using a high-pressure water jet and rods of soft metal, such as copper. Areas particularly susceptible to scale buildup, such as the firebox crown and narrow water spaces around the firebox, are given special attention. The inside of the boiler is inspected by sighting through the plug holes, with a particular check paid to the integrity of the firetubes, firebox crown and stays and absence of pitting or cracking of the boiler plates. The <b>gauge</b> <b>glass</b> cocks and tubes and fusible plug should be cleared of scale; if the core of the fusible plug shows signs of calcination the item should be replaced.|$|E
25|$|The boilers are {{inclined}} on the locomotives, {{to ensure that}} the boiler tubes and the firebox remain submerged when on the gradient, a standard practice on mountain railways – the locomotive always runs chimney-first up the mountain. The water <b>gauges</b> (<b>gauge</b> <b>glasses)</b> are mounted half at the centre on the locomotive so that the water level does not change with the gradient. One result of the boiler's angle is that the firehole door is at waist height, requiring the fireman to lift the coal some distance. The boiler is not superheated. Water is carried in tanks that run the full length of the boiler, but not all this water is for use in the boiler. The tanks are in fact divided into two sections, the smaller front section holding water that is used for cooling when the engine is running downhill. The drive to the wheels is through a series of levers that allow the pistons to have a longer stroke than the cranks. This is another common feature in mountain railways.|$|R

Familiarity with this disquieting occurrence was considered so important that a glass would often be smashed deliberately while a trainee driver was on the footplate, to give him practice in fitting a new tube. Although automatic ball valves are fitted in the mounts to limit the release of steam and scalding water, these can fail through accumulation of limescale. It was standard procedure to hold the coal scoop in front of the face while the other hand, holding the cap for protection, reached to turn off the valves at both ends of the glass.|$|E

40|$|We numerically {{compute the}} {{helicity}} modulus of the three-dimensional <b>gauge</b> <b>glass</b> by Monte Carlo simulations. Because the average free energy {{is independent of}} a twist angle, {{it is expected that}} the average helicity modulus, directly related to the superfluid density, vanishes when simulations are performed with periodic boundary conditions. This is not necessarily the case for the typical (median) value, which is nonzero, because the distribution of the helicity modulus among different disorder realizations is very asymmetric. We show that the data for the helicity modulus distribution are well described by a generalized extreme-value distribution with a nonzero location parameter (most probable value). A finite-size scaling analysis of the location parameter yields a critical temperature and critical exponents in agreement with previous results. This suggests that the location parameter is a good observable. There have been conflicting claims as to whether the superfluid density vanishes in the vortex glass phase, with Fisher et al. [Phys.

25|$|Vertical glass tubes, {{known as}} water <b>gauges</b> or water <b>glasses,</b> show {{the level of}} water in the boiler and are {{carefully}} monitored at all times while the boiler is being fired. Before the 1870s it was more common to have a series of try-cocks fitted to the boiler within reach of the crew; each try cock (at least two and usually three were fitted) was mounted at a different level. By opening each try-cock and seeing if steam or water vented through it, the level {{of water in the}} boiler could be estimated with limited accuracy. As boiler pressures increased the use of try-cocks became increasingly dangerous and the valves were prone to blockage with scale or sediment, giving false readings.

Because of the particle-hole symmetry in the phase glass model, we find that bosonic excitations in a phase glass background generate no Hall conductance at the Gaussian level. Furthermore, this result persists to any order in perturbation theory in the interactions.
