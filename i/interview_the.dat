5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured <b>interview,</b> <b>the</b> interviewer uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Rome {{to cover}} the Turkish War of Independence for the International News Service, Bryant lived with Bullitt in a villa in Constantinople in early 1923.

5|$|Some bootleggers noticed rock {{fans that}} {{had grown up with}} the music in the 1960s wanted rare or {{unreleased}} recordings of bands that had split up and looked unlikely to reform. For instance, the release of Golden Eggs, a bootleg of outtakes by The Yardbirds had proven to be so popular that the bootlegger had managed to <b>interview</b> <b>the</b> band's Keith Relf for the sequel, More Golden Eggs. Archive live performances became popular; a 1970 release of Dylan's set with the Hawks (later to become the Band) at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in 1966 (incorrectly assumed to be the Royal Albert Hall for years) was critically and commercially successful owing to the good sound quality and the concert's historical importance.|$|E

5|$|The pair <b>interview</b> <b>the</b> {{cast and}} crew as suspects, {{discovering}} that many would benefit from either of the deaths—producer Kenny Neiderman had been {{having an affair with}} Danbury; Rowdy Beeman replaced Carroll as director; Ruby Dahl and Ramona Tangent, whose roles in the film will expand without Danbury; and Mark Bianco, a method actor relishing the opportunity to meet Black, whose role he plays. Also questioned is Hugo Winston, the man whose partner was murdered in the earlier case and who is campaigning against what he sees as a disrespectful production.|$|E

5|$|Type-0 {{has never}} {{received}} an official localization {{in its original}} form.

In the wake of the game's release in Japan, 1UP.com and Joystiq speculated that the game could be successfully brought west as a port to the PlayStation Vita. Tabata later commented that the main reasons for the game not being localized were the flagging Western PSP market and uncertainties surrounding the Vita's commercial success.|$|E
