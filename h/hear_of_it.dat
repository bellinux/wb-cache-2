5|$|Roger however has a secret: he {{once had}} a {{long-term}} affair with the French aristocrat the Prince of Soissons, with whom he begins anew soon after arriving in Paris. Through the actions of courtiers jealous of Barbara's devotion to Roger, pamphlets eventually spread about the affair. The young and naive Barbara is among the last to <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and breaks down in tears and shock.|$|E
25|$|Lastly he {{met with}} his former {{commanding}} officer in Norway, Marschall. He advised Lütjens not to follow Raeder's orders too closely since {{the situation in the}} Atlantic could change at any moment. Lütjens would not <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> He refused to diverge from his standing orders. He reminded Marschall that two fleet commanders had already been removed from command—Marschall being one of them—and that he would follow the orders given him. What depressed Lütjens's already darkened mood was the fact that Ernst Lindemann, Bismarck's captain, was told by Karl Topp of the Marineamt, that he had run several war games to see if Tirpitz could reach the Atlantic undetected and that at every turn and under every circumstance, the ship was discovered. Lindemann certainly would have passed this information to Lütjens.|$|E
500|$|The Indians {{drove back}} and pinned down Reno's soldiers, but then spotted {{additional}} troops {{making their way}} along the hills {{to the east of}} the encampment. [...] This force was led by Custer himself, though that name would have meant nothing to Wooden Leg and the other Cheyenne at the time. [...] Most of the Indians broke off their fight with Reno to engage Custer and his soldiers. [...] Wooden Leg went back through the camp in the river valley rather than directly uphill towards the soldiers. [...] While he was there, his father tried to dissuade him from further fighting on the grounds that he had already done enough, but Wooden Leg would not <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and even persuaded others to rejoin the fight and take part in the total annihilation of Custer's command.|$|E
6000|$|Ted {{shook his}} 'ead. [...] "She'll turn up to oblige Emma," [...] he ses; [...] "but there's {{no need for}} you to overdo it, Charlie. If her young man 'appened to get to <b>'ear</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> it might cause trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{woman is}} plainly mad," [...] said Lady Janet. [...] "But it is {{certainly}} a startling form of madness when one first <b>hears</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Of</b> course we must keep the matter, for the present at least, a secret from Grace." ...|$|R

500|$|Lynch was {{a member}} of the Boy Scouts of America, {{attaining}} the rank of Eagle Scout. His childhood friend Toby Keeler posited that this [...] experience and the [...] "be prepared" [...] Scout motto formed the basis of Lynch's [...] "do [...] it yourself" [...] approach to filmmaking and art, and shaped his ability to [...] "make things out of nothing". Lynch had initially joined the Scouts in order to [...] "put it behind" [...] him, but continued at the urging of his father; he eventually summed up his biography as [...] "Eagle Scout. Missoula, Montana" [...] in a 1990 press release for Wild at Heart. As a Boy Scout, Lynch was present at John F. Kennedy's presidential inauguration, which took place on Lynch's 15th birthday. When Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Lynch was the first in his school [...] to <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> as he was working on a display case rather than attending class.|$|E
500|$|In late 1594, {{she began}} a furious {{campaign}} for custody of Henry, recruiting a faction of supporters to her cause, including the chancellor, John Maitland of Thirlestane. Nervous of the lengths to which Anne might go, James formally charged Mar in writing never to surrender Henry to anyone except on orders {{from his own}} mouth, [...] "because in the surety of my son consists my surety", nor to yield Henry to the Queen even {{in the event of}} his own death. Anne demanded the matter be referred to the Council, but James would not <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> After public scenes in which James reduced her to rage and tears over the issue, Anne became so bitterly upset that in July 1595 she suffered a miscarriage. Thereafter, she outwardly abandoned her campaign, but it was thought permanent damage had been done to the marriage. In August 1595, John Colville wrote: [...] "There is nothing but lurking hatred disguised with cunning dissimulation betwixt the King and the Queen, each intending by slight to overcome the other." [...] Nevertheless, the Queen had six more children by James.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{career at}} the Met, however, was not without its ups-and-downs. Flagstad got {{involved}} in a long-running feud with tenor co-star Lauritz Melchior after Melchior took offense to some comments Flagstad made about [...] "stupid publicity photos" [...] during a game of bridge in Flagstad's hotel suite while the two were on tour together in Rochester, NY. Present during the infamous bridge game were Flagstad, Melchior and his wife, and Edwin McArthur. Afterwards, Melchior fanned the flames further by insisting that there be no solo curtain calls for Flagstad when the two performed together. Audiences had no clue that, despite the marvelous and sometimes historic performances, the two {{never said a word}} to each other off stage for the next two years. It was Flagstad's husband Henry Johansen who finally brought the two together to make peace. Flagstad also feuded with the Met's general manager, Edward Johnson, after conductor Artur Bodanzky's death, when she asked to be conducted for a few performances by her accompanist, Edwin McArthur, rather than by the Met's new conductor Erich Leinsdorf. Flagstad had wanted this for McArthur, whom she had taken under her wing. Johnson refused and would not <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> any further. Flagstad did get her way, though; she went over Johnson's head and discussed the matter with the Met's board of directors, particularly David Sarnoff, RCA and NBC founder and chairman. It was Sarnoff who made the arrangements for McArthur to begin conducting Met productions on a limited basis. Her relationship with Johnson improved, however; just before Flagstad left the Met in 1941, on the night of her 100th performance of Isolde ...|$|E
6000|$|Maria rather funnily {{considered}} it. [...] "Floating {{her over}} in champagne?

6000|$|... "I am {{sure she}} has not heard of it. But if {{that kind of thing}} becomes a habit, of course she will <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> All Dillsborough would <b>hear</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> if that became common. At any rate it is not manly to drown it in drink." ...|$|E

60|$|George {{had gone}} to spend {{two or three days}} with a {{companion}} on a neighboring estate, and having departed early in the morning, before Tom's misfortune had been made public, had left without <b>hearing</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|Third, Christ Jesus {{would have}} mercy offered, {{in the first}} place, to the biggest sinners, because, by their {{forgiveness}} and salvation, others, <b>hearing</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> will be encouraged the more to come to him for life.|$|R
