5|$|At least 20 {{publishers}} {{rejected the}} book before Geisel ran {{into an old}} college classmate, who had just become juvenile editor at Vanguard Press. Vanguard agreed to publish the book, and it met with <b>high</b> <b>praise</b> from critics upon release, though sales were not as impressive. Later analyses of the book have focused on its connections to Geisel's childhood; the street of the title is probably named after a street in Geisel's hometown of Springfield, Massachusetts. Geisel returned to fictionalized versions of Springfield in later books, and Marco appeared again in 1947 in the Dr. Seuss book McElligot's Pool.|$|E

His ability against both fast and slow bowling earned <b>high</b> <b>praise,</b> including from his captain Bill Lawry. When the Australians arrived in South Africa in early 1970, following their victory over India, Lawry told the local media that Chappell was the best all-round batsman in the world. His appraisal looked misguided when Chappell managed just 92 runs (at 11.5 average), with a top score of 34, as Australia lost 0–4.|$|E

5|$|A third {{milestone}} in Wodehouse's life came {{towards the end}} of 1915: his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern introduced him to the writer Guy Bolton, who became Wodehouse's closest friend and a regular collaborator. Bolton and Kern had a musical, Very Good Eddie, running at the Princess Theatre in New York. The show was successful, but they thought the song lyrics weak and invited Wodehouse to join them on its successor. This was Miss Springtime (1916), which ran for 227 performances—a good run {{by the standards of the}} day. The team produced several more successes, including Leave It to Jane (1917), Oh, Boy! (1917–18) and Oh, Lady! Lady!! (1918), and Wodehouse and Bolton wrote a few more shows with other composers. In these musicals Wodehouse's lyrics won <b>high</b> <b>praise</b> from critics as well as fellow lyricists such as Ira Gershwin.|$|E
