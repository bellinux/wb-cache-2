25|$|Andrew Freeman of Grand Forks, North Dakota, {{invented the}} <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> heater around 1940 and {{received}} a patent for it on November 8, 1949. In 1951, Freeman received another patent on an improved <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> heater. These early heaters replaced one of the engine's cylinder head bolts with a hollow, threaded shank containing a resistive heating element. Before the block heater was introduced, people {{used a variety of}} methods to warm engines before starting them, such as pouring hot water on the engine block or draining the engine's oil for storage inside overnight. Some even shoveled embers underneath their vehicle's engine to obtain the same effect.|$|E
25|$|A {{block heater}} warms {{the engine of}} an {{automobile}} in order to ease and speed starting and vehicle warm-up in cold weather. The most common type is an electric heating element connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille. The block heater may replace one of the engine's core plugs, or may be installed in line {{with one of the}} radiator or heater hoses. The block heater, first known as a <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> heater, was invented in 1945 by Andrew Freeman in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Freeman used some scrap hoses and copper tubing onto the heating element of an old flat-iron and produced the first headbolt heater, which warmed the engine's water jacket and the oil film between cylinder heads and pistons. U.S. patent #2,487,326 was filed on November 4, 1946 and issued to Freeman on November 8, 1949.|$|E
2500|$|American Motors {{introduced}} a die-cast aluminum block {{version of the}} OHV [...] engine in 1961. It was produced through 1964. This engine used cast-iron cylinder liners and a cast-iron head. The cylinder heads for {{the two types of}} block (aluminum and cast iron) are of similar design, but are not interchangeable. The cylinder head for the aluminum block is roughly 1/8" [...] wider than that for the cast iron [...] block and uses a slightly different <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern.|$|E

25|$|A third cause {{might be}} {{cracks in the}} engine block from {{overtightening}} the <b>head</b> <b>bolts.</b> Some engines developed cracks in the block that would leak coolant and/or oil, sometimes accompanied by broken <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> directly above the crack. The leak would spray coolant or oil, the latter resulting in fire if sprayed onto the hot catalytic converter or exhaust manifold {{at the front of}} the engine compartment.|$|R
50|$|Thicker {{cylinder}} head casting taken into use early in model year to strengthen head against cracking. Longer <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> needed {{because of the}} change.|$|R
2500|$|Owing {{to a large}} {{error in}} the factory <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> torque {{specifications}} (likely owing to switching away from using an asbestos head gasket {{in lieu of a}} copper one), all of these engines had severe problems with blown head gaskets. Toyota never issued a recall for any of the affected vehicles. The problem could be easily fixed by replacing the head gasket and torquing the head bolts to [...] of torque. However, owing to the lack of a recall or appropriate service bulletin, the head gasket problem would recur in another 75,000 miles or so if the gasket was replaced and the bolts were retorqued to the erroneous service manual specifications of [...] With the head bolts torqued correctly, the engines were otherwise extremely durable.|$|E
2500|$|Oldsmobile also {{introduced}} a 5.7L (350 cu-in, V8) diesel engine option on its Custom Cruiser, Delta 88 and 98 models in 1978 {{and a smaller}} 4.3L (260 cu-in, V8) displacement diesel on the 1979 Cutlass Salon and Cutlass Supreme/Cutlass Calais models. These were largely based on their gasoline engines but with heavier duty cast blocks, re-designed heads, fast glow plugs, and on the 5.7L, oversized cranks, main bearings, and wrist pins. There were several problems with these engines, including water and corrosion in the injectors (no water separator in the fuel line), paraffin clogging of fuel lines and filters in cold weather, reduced lubrication in the heads due to undersized oil galleys, <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> failures, {{and the use of}} aluminum rockers and stanchions in the 4.3L V8 engines. While the 5.7L was also offered on various Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, and Pontiac models, it was eventually discontinued by all divisions in 1985. [...] 4.3L V6 diesels were also offered between 1982 and 1985.|$|E
2500|$|The 196 OHV {{requires}} more periodic maintenance than newer-model engines. The head bolts must be re-torqued (retightening process) regularly. Factory service manuals recommend that <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> torque be checked every [...] and to re-torque them every [...] With modern head gaskets this service interval {{can be extended}} to re-torque the bolts every , or every other year. The cause of the headbolts loosening over time {{is believed to be}} thermal expansion and contraction of the head due to the rather heavy design. The head expands and contracts by as much as 0.020" [...] in height during normal operation, this loosens the bolts over time and eventually will cause the seal between head and block to fail. This maintenance is also imperative to prevent the engine from overheating (the first sign of a blown head gasket) and warping or cracking the head. The cast-iron liners in the aluminum block version can also shift if the head bolts are not properly torqued and the engine is allowed to overheat. Good replacement heads and aluminum blocks for these engines are now difficult to find.|$|E
50|$|Closely {{related to}} {{carriage}} bolts are timber bolts, meant {{for use with}} large wood planks and structures. They have a domed head that is proportionally wider {{than that of a}} carriage bolt, and instead of a square section of shank under the head, they have four sharp-cornered fillets that grip the edge of the hole in the wood to prevent rotation. They are also known as mushroom <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> or dome <b>head</b> <b>bolts.</b> They are used to fasten wood to wood, instead of metal to wood.|$|R
40|$|A {{prototype}} extractor {{was developed}} for extraction of okra seeds. Studies were conducted on effect of different cylinder speed (5, 6 and 7 m/s), concave clearance (7, 10 and 13 mm), moisture content of okra fruit (12. 3, 15. 8 and 18. 8 % db) and type of extraction drum at a feed rate of 70 kg/h on machine performance and seed quality. Three types of extractor drums namely; square <b>head</b> <b>bolted,</b> rubberized and rasp-bar were used. Seed quality was evaluated for vigour index, dead seed, normal and abnormal germination. The performance of seed extractor was evaluated for its extraction efficiency, cleaning efficiency, seed loss and energy consumption at different crop and machine variables. Extraction efficiency (99. 3 %) caused by square <b>head</b> <b>bolted</b> drum was found highest among all the three extraction mechanisms. Cleaning efficiency {{was found in the}} range of 97. 9 to 99. 6 % for all crop variables. The value of seed loss (4. 7 %) was low with the square <b>head</b> <b>bolted</b> drum in comparison to rasp-bar and rubberized extraction mechanism. The average energy consumption per quintal (100 kg) seed was found to be 1. 9 kWh. It was found that germination and vigour index decreased with increase in pod moisture content. Higher germination was found with square <b>head</b> <b>bolted</b> drum as compared to the rasp-bar and rubberized drum. The germination decreased, whereas dead seed percentage increased with cylinder speed. The best seed quality machine performance was found at 12. 3 percent moisture content (d. b.), 7 mm concave clearance and 5 m/s cylinder speed with the square <b>head</b> <b>bolted</b> drum extraction mechanism...|$|R
50|$|Locking was {{achieved}} by a solid <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> and three <b>bolt</b> lugs. The <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> {{was designed to be}} removable thus allowing the owner to vary the head space by replacing the <b>head.</b> The <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> is of the floating type whereby it is a loose fit in the bolt tube and held in place by a pin, the firing pin passing through a hole in that pin. This allows the locking lugs to self centre with even pressure when the action is locked.|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} kind of Mr Toots to carry him {{to the top of}} the house so tenderly; and Paul told him that it was. But Mr Toots said he would do a great deal more than that, if he could; and indeed he did more as it was: for he helped Paul to undress, and helped him to bed, in the kindest manner possible, and then sat down by the bedside and chuckled very much; while Mr Feeder, B.A., leaning over the bottom of the bedstead, set all the little {{bristles}} on his <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> upright with his bony hands, and then made believe to spar at Paul with great science, on account of his being all right again, which was so uncommonly facetious, and kind too in Mr Feeder, that Paul, not being able to make up his mind whether it was best to laugh or cry at him, did both at once.|$|E

50|$|Other {{important}} {{differences between the}} Vortec 8100 and older Big Blocks include a changed firing order (1-8-7-2-6-5-4-3), a new 18-bolt <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern, longer connecting rods, different symmetrical intake ports, different oil pan rails {{and the use of}} metric threads throughout the engine. The fuel-injection system for the Vortec 8100 is nearly identical to that used on Gen III engines, right down to the fuel and spark tables in the ECU.|$|E
5000|$|The A279 {{initially}} {{used the}} B-block <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern, which [...] "badly hampered" [...] its exhaust ports, forcing {{the use of}} a serpentine flow around some of the outer bolts This was changed late in development, but not before some tooling based on the original design had already been created. This meant the head was not truly hemispherical, but had more intake port area than exhaust (3.575 in2 cm2 versus (2.488 in2 cm2).|$|E
50|$|Gold models had {{single coil}} pickups with clear silver plastic covers and {{phillips}} <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> adjustable pole pieces. The Upbeat model came with an optional transparent black plastic cover. These pickups appeared on Kay instruments {{through the late}} 1960s and are sometimes called “Kessel” or “Kleenex Box” pickups. The Jazz Special Bass has a single blade pickup as used on the K-161 and K-162 (tilted slightly towards the neck at the treble side), {{as well as a}} distinctive, oversized headstock.|$|E
50|$|Each <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> type {{includes}} a different means of cartridge ejection. The push-feed <b>bolt</b> <b>heads</b> utilize a plunger-type ejector {{mounted in the}} bolt face.The controlled-round-feed <b>bolt</b> <b>heads</b> have a relief cut for a receiver-mounted, spring-loaded folding ejector to pass through as the bolt is retracted.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{cylinder}} head design (Removal of the heads {{was designed to}} be accomplished whilst leaving the camshaft and valvetrain in place), <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> were both vertically and diagonally set in the engine block, to be accessible around the camshafts. As the bolts were made of the same material and set on different angles; this created areas of different expansion under heat, creating not only head warping but resulting in extremely difficult to remove cylinder <b>heads</b> as <b>bolts</b> stretched and corroded in place at different rates.|$|R
50|$|GM ceased {{production}} of the Northstar series in July 2010, with the final cars to receive it, the Cadillac DTS, Buick Lucerne, and Cadillac STS, rolling off the line in 2011. Newer Cadillac V8 models like the CTS-V use the GM LS small-block OHV engine, marking {{a return to a}} simpler push rod engine design. The North star has been plagued from the beginning with reliability issues, particularly head gaskets that fail when <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> pull out of the block, allowing coolant to seep into the oil system. To exacerbate the situation, the entire engine must be completely removed to replace the head gasket, and a solution implemented to repair the <b>head</b> <b>bolts.</b> The cost to repair is usually upwards of $3000, and involves adding inserts (Normserts, timeserts) in the block to better grip the bolts. The LC3 supercharged variant, with its sealed deck design, has been largely immune from these issues. Cadillac implemented design changes throughout the Northstar's run (particularly 2000 and 2004), lengthening the <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> and making the threads coarser, but even the 2004+ engines have experienced head gasket failures. The only way to bulletproof the engine is to tap deeper, drill extremely coarse threads, and stud the head to the block.|$|R
50|$|The Ford Boss 302 is a {{high-performance}} small block 302 cuin L V8 engine manufactured by Ford Motor Company. The original {{version of this}} engine {{was used in the}} 1969 and 1970 Boss 302 Mustangs and was constructed by attaching heads designed for the planned 351 Cleveland (which debuted the following year) to a Windsor engine block. The construction was aided by the two engines sharing a cylinder <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern, though the Boss heads had to have their coolant passages slightly modified.|$|E

50|$|The 1969-70 Boss 302 (Hi-Po) {{engine was}} created in 1968 for the SCCA's 1969 Trans-Am road racing series. Available in the Boss 302 Mustangs of 1969-70, it's a unique Ford small-block engine {{featuring}} a thin-wall, high nickel content block casting. It differed substantially from regular 302s, with 4-bolt mains, screw in freeze plugs, and heads using a canted valve design being developed for the planned 351 Cleveland (which debuted the following year). The construction was aided by the two engines sharing a cylinder <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> pattern, though the Boss 302 heads had to have their coolant passages slightly modified.|$|E
5000|$|On used bolt-action firearms, especially, the {{headspace}} {{should be}} checked with headspace gauges prior to shooting to ensure it is correct, {{and to prevent}} over-stressing chambers and cartridge brass. Some bolt-action rifles, such as the Lee-Enfield, {{have a series of}} different length bolts available to extend the service life of the rifle, for taking up any wear of the bolt and chamber occurring from long years of service. In the case of the No. 4 Lee-Enfield <b>bolt,</b> the <b>bolt</b> <b>heads</b> themselves are replaceable separate from the bolt and are marked 0, 1, 2, or 3, with each <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> in sequence being nominally 0.003" [...] longer than the <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> numbered one less, for easily taking up any action stretching that may have occurred.

5000|$|... Ford/International used four Torque to Yield (TTY) {{cylinder}} <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> per cylinder for the 6.0s and 6.4s. TTY bolts {{offer some}} of the most precise clamping force available, but can be problematic.

This has never been addressed by Ford {{due to the fact that}} other malfunctions or abuse must occur to stretch the bolts. Some in the aftermarket will replace the factory <b>bolts</b> with <b>head</b> studs in an attempt to protect the head gaskets from future failure. If this is done without addressing the underlying issue, the head gaskets may fail again bringing along a cracked or warped cylinder head. In contrast, the Powerstroke 7.3s and 6.7s have 6 <b>head</b> <b>bolts</b> per cylinder while the IDI 7.3s and 6.9s have five.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to the Chevrolet Camaro's success in the SCCA Trans-Am series, Ford engineers developed a new racing engine from the Windsor series small block. The first attempt mated a tunnel-port head to a 289 cu in block, but the displacement proved to be too small to deliver the desired power. The next iteration of the engine mated an improved head design to the 302 cu in block, producing the famous [...] "Boss 302". The heads from the Boss 302 became the production heads on the 335-series Cleveland engines, which used the same bore spacing and <b>head</b> <b>bolt</b> configuration as the Windsor engines.|$|E

There were also many differences between the racing Hemi's and the street Hemi, including {{but not limited to}} compression ratio, camshaft, intake manifold, exhaust manifold. Some 1960s NASCAR and NHRA Hemi engines featured magnesium cross-ram intake manifolds and magnesium oil pans in an attempt to reduce the massive weight of the overall engine, along with chain-driven internal dry-sump oil systems.
