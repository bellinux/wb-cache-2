5|$|Malawi {{has taken}} many steps towards slowing {{the spread of}} HIV/AIDS, such as {{increasing}} access to condoms and improving testing services and treatment options. Many of these efforts have been funded by international donors including the World Bank, the <b>Global</b> <b>Fund,</b> the World Health Organization, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS). The World Bank has lent $407.9 million to Malawi, the <b>Global</b> <b>Fund</b> has agreed to give $390 million, and PEPFAR has donated $25 million for prevention and treatment campaigns.|$|E

However, soon after his election, Mutharika experienced tensions with Muluzi after implementing an anti-corruption program, which distracted the government from addressing the nation's food and HIV/AIDS-related crises. Despite these obstacles, Mutharika successfully developed a National AIDS Policy and appointed a Principal Secretary for HIV/AIDS during his presidency.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} people using {{antiretroviral}} therapy in Malawi has increased dramatically in the past decade: between 2004 and 2011, an estimated 300,000 people gained access to antiretroviral treatment. In addition to improving access to antiretroviral therapy, in 2008, Malawi introduced the World Health Organization's treatment guidelines for antiretroviral therapy, which improved the quality of treatment available to Malawians. However, Malawi's proposal for a new antiretroviral treatment plan in 2011, which would have cost $105 million per year, {{was rejected by the}} <b>Global</b> <b>Fund,</b> threatening Malawi's ability to continue expanding access to antiretroviral treatment.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays on diversification benefits, return characteristics, {{and the performance of}} U. S. -based global government bond mutual funds. The first essay examines: (i) the performance of U. S. -based <b>global</b> government bond <b>funds,</b> (ii) the benefits of inclusion of U. S. -based <b>global</b> government bond <b>funds</b> in existing portfolios, (iii) the persistence of risk-adjusted performance of <b>global</b> bond <b>funds,</b> (iv) the influence of fund characteristics on performance, and (v) the return seasonality of <b>global</b> bond <b>funds.</b> The second essay studies: (i) the usefulness of style analysis on <b>global</b> bond <b>funds,</b> (ii) the style-adjusted performance of U. S. -based <b>global</b> bond <b>funds,</b> and (iii) the investment behavior of <b>global</b> bond <b>fund</b> managers. This study is important because it is the first to provide a complete study of diversification benefits, return characteristics, and style-adjusted performance measurement and performance evaluation of a large sample of U. S. -based <b>global</b> government bond <b>funds.</b> It is also first in casting U. S. -based <b>global</b> government bond <b>funds</b> investment as an alternative investment to U. S. domestic bond funds. The empirical results of this study will greatly benefit individual investors who consider investing in U. S. bond fund markets or consider U. S. -based <b>global</b> government bond <b>funds</b> as an addition or an alternative to U. S. domestic bond funds. This study also contributes significantly to the scarce literature of style-adjusted performance measurement and evaluations of the <b>global</b> government bond <b>fund</b> industry. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} <b>global</b> {{convertible}} bond <b>funds</b> (CBFs) and their resulting equity-bond exposures are regionally biased. <b>Global</b> bond <b>fund</b> managers display home bias, resulting in CBFs {{that are not}} only tilted towards the home market but also reflect the different bond-equity exposures of European and US convertibles. More specifically we find that <b>global</b> <b>funds</b> managed by a European asset management firm are more bond-like than <b>global</b> <b>funds</b> managed by a US-based asset manager. Hence, investors have {{to account for the}} asset management company’s origin to avoid that the performance of the fund and its correlation with other assets is not in line with investor’s ex ante expectations about globally managed portfolios. Our results also indicate that for investors of European-based CBFs this home bias has resulted in an ex post opportunity cost up to 1. 38 % per year, depending on the sample period. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the performance}} of the <b>global</b> hedge <b>fund</b> industry to determine whether alpha, or risk-adjusted excess returns are earned. The efficient market hypothesis questions whether professional investors such as hedge funds can produce superior returns over and above a passive investment strategy. The study examines 7, 355 surviving and non-surviving <b>global</b> hedge <b>funds</b> for the period 1994 - 2006. This paper proposes a simple multi-factor model which is easier to implement in comparison to more complex option-based frameworks that are proposed in the literature. The multi-factor framework employed in this study demonstrates that the returns of individual funds and the systematic return of the <b>global</b> hedge <b>fund</b> industry can be replicated with passive investment strategies in global financial markets. This study reveals little alpha or manager skill in this sample of hedge funds and therefore questions the validity of high management fee structures in this segment of the <b>global</b> <b>funds</b> management industry.

40|$|Using unique micro data on U. S. {{institutional}} investor portfolios, this paper studies how capital, {{meant to be}} invested globally, is actually diversified internationally. We show that although the mutual fund industry has moved toward funds that have more flexibility to invest across countries and regions (<b>global</b> <b>funds),</b> mutual funds invest in a finite, rather small number of firms, almost independently of the set of available instruments. The number of mutual fund holdings in stocks and countries from a given region declines as <b>funds</b> become more <b>global.</b> This restricted investment practice has a cost: there are unexploited gains from international diversification. Mutual funds could achieve better returns by broadening their investment scope to include stocks held by specialized funds within the same mutual fund family. This investment pattern is neither explained {{by the lack of}} available instruments or information, nor by a better ability of <b>global</b> <b>funds</b> to minimize losses...|$|R
