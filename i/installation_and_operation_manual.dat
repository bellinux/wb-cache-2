40|$|A crescente preocupaÃÃo com o meio ambiente e, em especial com o uso dos recursos hÃdricos resultou na valorizaÃÃo crescente da Ãgua potÃvel como bem de consumo. InÃmeras sÃo as atividades que utilizam este recurso, uma delas, os Postos de Lavagem de VeÃculos (PLVâs), objeto da pesquisa. No Brasil, cerca de 32. 700 postos de lavagem transformam aproximadamente 3, 7 milhÃes de metros cÃbicos de Ãgua/mÃs em efluente. Neste contexto, este trabalho teve como objetivo geral o desenvolvimento de tecnologia alternativa para tratamento de efluentes visando a reutilizaÃÃo da Ãgua de postos de lavagem de veÃculos. Para tanto, a metodologia teve como base sete aspectos principais: 1) DiagnÃstico da situaÃÃo atual em torno da atividade dos PLVâs; 2) CaracterizaÃÃo do efluente bruto gerado pelos PLVâs; 3) Modelagem matemÃtica para identificar os fatores crÃticos de projeto; 4) Desenvolvimento do protÃtipo; 5) Pesquisa em banco de patentes para verificar a inovaÃÃo; 6) ElaboraÃÃo do processo para pedido de patente e 7) EspecificaÃÃes dos critÃrios para desenvolvimento de manuais de instalaÃÃo e operaÃÃo do sistema de tratamento de efluentes de PLVâs. Para o caso da cidade de Toledo-PR constatou-se a existÃncia de 47. 155 veÃculos automotores cadastrados (dos quais apenas 27 % passam pelos PLVs), com um consumo mÃdio de 2682, 5 m 3 de Ãgua/mÃs, geraÃÃo de 2. 921, 14 m 3 de efluente/mÃs com caracterÃstica altamente variÃvel, tendo apenas 97 % dos postos algum sistema de tratamento. Constatou-se a ineficiÃncia dos sistemas convencionais cuja anÃlise resultou na proposiÃÃo/desenvolvimento de duas tecnologias (pedido de patente NÂ MU 8701195 - 6 de 23. 07. 2007 e NÂ MU 8701196 - 4 de 23. 07. 2007) tendo entre suas caracterÃsticas o baixo custo, facilidade de instalaÃÃo/operaÃÃo/manutenÃÃo, necessidade de pouco espaÃo fÃsico, eficiente e versÃtil na sua forma de aplicaÃÃo. Desta forma, este trabalho deve contribuir com a minimizaÃÃo da problemÃtica {{ambiental}} em torno da atividade dos PLVâs. The increasing {{concern with}} the environment and specially {{with the use of}} the water resources resulted in the increasing valorization of the drinking water as well of consumption. Innumerable are the activities that use this resource, one of them, the Car Wash Station (CWS), object of this research. In Brazil, about 32, 700 CWS approximately consume 3. 7 millions of cubical meters of water per month that transform it in wastewater. In this context, this work had, as general objective, the development of alternative technology for wastewater treatment aiming the recovery of the water from car wash station. For so much, the methodology had as base seven main aspects: 1) diagnosis of the current situation around the activity of CWS; 2) characterization of the crude wastewater generated by CWS; 3) mathematical modeling to identify the critical factors of project; 4) development of the prototype; 5) researches of patents to verify the innovation; 6) elaboration of the process for patent request and 7) specifications of the criteria for development of <b>installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> <b>manuals</b> of the wastewater treatment system. In the case of Toledo/PR city, from the 47, 155 registered self-driven vehicles (of the whichonly 27 % pass for CWS), with a medium consumption of 2682, 5 m 3 water per month, it was verified a generation of 2. 921, 14 m 3 wastewater per month with highly variable characteristic, having only 97 % of the CWS some treatment system. The inefficiency of the conventional systems was verified and the analysis resulted in the proposition/development of two technologies (patent request number MU 8701195 - 6 23 / 07 / 2007 and number MU 8701196 - 4 23 / 07 / 2007) having, among their characteristics, the low cost,installation/operation/maintenance easiness, need of little space, efficiency and versatile in application form. In this way, this work should intended to contribute with the minimization of the environmental problem around the activity of CW...|$|R

40|$|This Environmental Assessment (EA) {{has been}} {{prepared}} to analyze potential environmental impacts relevant to the proposed <b>installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> of an Electronic Warfare (EW) Range in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). The purpose of the Proposed Action is to sustain and enhance the level and type of EW training currently being conducted by Navy assets using the Northwest Training Range Complex (NWTRC), to provide the ability to accommodate growth in future training requirements, and to maximize the ability of local units to achieve their training requirements on local ranges. Three alternatives have been analyzed in this EA: • Under the No Action Alternative, very limited EW training, without the enhanced capability of fixed and mobile emitters, {{would continue to be}} conducted in the NWTRC; and intermediate-level EW training for certification would continue to occur at the Mountain Home Air Force Base approximately 400 nautical miles southeast of Naval Air Station Whidbey Island (NASWI). • Alternative 1 includes: • <b>Installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> of a Mission Control and Debrief Center in an existing facility at NASWI • <b>Installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> of a fixed emitter at Naval Station Everett Annex Pacific Beach, to include renovation of Building 104 • <b>Installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> of communication equipment on an existing tower in the Olympic Military Operations Area (MOA) at Octopus Mountai...|$|R
