25|$|The {{developers}} of the <b>Holywood</b> Exchange {{were able to}} take advantage of existing road connections. The most important element of these connections was a full flyover on the A2, already built for access to the Belfast Harbour Estate. The Belfast-Bangor railway line runs between the site and the A2. There are proposals for a railway halt to serve both <b>Holywood</b> Exchange and the adjacent Belfast City Airport. However Belfast City Airport argues that constructing the halt adjacent to the airport terminal (further away from <b>Holywood</b> Exchange) would encourage more air travellers to use the rail connection. The Airport has also stated that it will consider providing road access to the airport through <b>Holywood</b> Exchange as a way of reducing congestion on the existing airport access route.|$|E

25|$|The Belfast Metropolitan Area Plan 2015 {{identifies}} {{the need to}} improve transport links to George Best Belfast City Airport from the city centre.

However, in April 2008 the decision was taken not to proceed with the light rail project, with the DRD choosing to implement a new bus-based network. The pressure group Rail 21 has stated that the Tillysburn proposal is insufficient for what the new station is expected to provide – a link to the airport, transport provision for <b>Holywood</b> Exchange and a park and ride facility.

It does this principally via an in-depth analysis of The Russians Are Coming The Russians Are Coming, the second highest-grossing American Cold War movie of the 1960 s and the most Soviet-friendly one.

Tema suradnje antropologa s vojnom imperijalnom mašinerijom dotaknuta scenarijem filma, u članku se obrađuje u jeci stvarne antropološške militarizacije: 2007. godine američka ratna strategija u Afganistanu i Iraku doživljava “kulturni okret” omogućen novačenjem antropologa i socijalnih znanstvenika u sklopu Human Terrain Systema…It is {{hard not}} to read James Cameron’s movie Avatar from the postcolonial studies point of view. What {{appears to be an}} attempt of {{criticism}} towards the American imperialism, is build upon the rasistic subtext (and a vague discourse of, as Žižek put it, “Holywood’s Marxism”). Cameron constructed the Na’vi – the representation of the universal American other in a form of the blue aliens attributed with wide range of very “native” characteristics. In this search of the nativeness essence, Cameron (and his team of anthropologists) even managed to widen the scope of colonial tropes. By projecting the universal natives into outer space, the nativness is alienized, and the natives are depicted as non-human species. With the tail attribution, <b>Holywood’s</b> colonial trope becomes even more vivid: the natives are animalised. After the Avatar became the highest grossing movie in the history, Cameron was engaged by the US-based NGO Amazon Watch to help them fight for the rights of the tribes living in the Amazon Basin, since their traditional way of life is threatened by the big national project – the Monte Belo Dam on the Xingu river in Brazil. So, in the inverted logic of simulacrum, Cameron travelled in the “Heart Of Darkness” to meet some real Na’vi, but instead of leading them in the armed insurrection against the government (like his main character in Avatar did), he is thinking about filming a sequel. One of the anthropology-related topics provoked by the movie is the collaboration of the army and the anthropologists. Since 2007, in a context of Iraq and Afganistan wars, collaboration of this kind became a central point in the “counter-insurgency” war strategies of the US Army. This strategy is called the “Human Terrain System” (HTS) and is condemned by the American Anthropological Association (AAA) for violating the rules of the AAA Code of Ethics. Nevertheless, there are some misinterpretations of the HTS (considered in the paper) that dangerously confuse anthropological militarization with activism...|$|R
