5|$|On 7 January 2011, {{the parts}} {{announced}} that they had reached a compromise. Stabæk would remain at Telenor Arena {{for at least the}} 2011 season. In addition, the club held an option to take over the responsibility for events at the venue. Stabæk Fotball had until 30 June to accept the option, which would allow the club to remain at the venue on a permanent basis. This would require them to invest NOK20 million in an event administration, which would increase event revenue, {{but at the same time}} move the risk from Stabæk Holding to Stabæk Fotball. If the club declined the option, they would not be allowed to play at the venue from the 2012 season. On 30 June, Stabæk {{announced that they}} would not fulfill the option to continue renting the stadium. The necessary NOK35 million would entail a risk the club was not willing to take. The club stated that they hoped they could remain at the stadium by establishing a foundation which could purchase the venue form Ulrichsen. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>does</b> not work out, the club will have to relocate from the 2012 season. The club is then considering relocating back to Nadderud, to Ullevaal or to Marienlyst. The club estimates that any relocation would result in the club losing half their revenue. Stabæk played its last match at Fornebu Arena on 20 November 2011, losing 1–2 against Haugesund. Subsequently, the pitch was removed, and Stabæk returned to Nadderud from the 2012 season.|$|E

Edward, after mistakenly being informed that Bella has committed suicide, travels to Volterra, Italy, to request the Volturi to destroy him. Alice returns to Forks and discovers Bella is alive; she and Bella pursue Edward to Italy and successfully prevent him from showing himself in daylight to humans, an act {{that would result in}} his execution. The trio are taken to the Volturi. Because Bella knows about vampires, the Volturi want to kill her, but Alice claims she has foreseen Bella becoming a vampire. Because most humans are unaware that vampires exist, the Volturi threaten to kill Bella <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>does</b> not happen soon. Upon returning home, Edward tells Bella that he never stopped loving her, and he only left Forks because he thought it would protect her. He apologizes for his misguided action and asks for her forgiveness, which Bella quickly grants. Bella, intent on becoming a vampire, decides that Edward's family should vote on her fate. All but Rosalie and Edward vote for her to be changed, but Edward agrees to change her himself if she will marry him.|$|E

500|$|Gregory, however, {{also says}} that he thinks that Ingoberg was seventy years old in 589; and this would make her about forty when she married Charibert. This is possible, but seems unlikely, {{especially}} as Charibert {{seems to have had}} a preference for younger women, again according to Gregory's account. This would imply an earlier birth date for Bertha. On the other hand, Gregory refers to Æthelberht {{at the time of his}} marriage to Bertha simply as [...] "a man of Kent", and in the 589 passage concerning Ingoberg's death, which was written in about 590 or 591, he refers to Æthelberht as [...] "the son of the king of Kent". <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>does</b> not simply reflect Gregory's ignorance of Kentish affairs, which seems unlikely given the close ties between Kent and the Franks, then some assert that Æthelberht's reign cannot have begun before 589.|$|E

500|$|Trying {{to resolve}} Larkin's {{contradictory}} opinions on race {{in his book}} Such Deliberate Disguises: The Art of Philip Larkin, the writer Richard Palmer quotes a letter Larkin wrote to Betjeman, as if it exposes [...] "all the post-Motion and post-Letters furore about Larkin’s 'racism' as the nonsense it is":"The American Negro is trying {{to take a step}} forward that can be compared only to the ending of slavery in the nineteenth century. And despite the dogs, the hosepipes and the burnings, advances have already been made towards giving the Negro his civil rights that would have been inconceivable when Louis Armstrong was a young man. These advances will doubtless continue. They will end only when the Negro is as well-housed, educated and medically cared for as the white man."Reviewing Palmer's book, John G. Rodwan, Jr. proposes that: [...] "a less forgiving reader could counter by asking <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>does</b> not qualify as the thought of a “true racist”: 'I find the state of the nation quite terrifying. In 10 years’ time we shall all be cowering under our beds as hordes of blacks steal anything they can lay their hands on.' Or this: 'We don’t go to cricket Test matches now, too many fucking niggers about.'"Despite controversy about his personal life and opinions, Larkin remains one of Britain's most popular poets. In 2003, almost two decades after his death, Larkin was chosen as [...] "the nation's best-loved poet" [...] in a survey by the Poetry Book Society, and in 2008 The Times named Larkin as the greatest British post-war writer. Three of his poems, [...] "This Be The Verse", [...] "The Whitsun Weddings" [...] and [...] "An Arundel Tomb", featured in the Nation's Top 100 Poems as voted for by viewers of the BBC's Bookworm in 1995. Media interest in Larkin has increased in the twenty-first century. Larkin's collection The Whitsun Weddings is one of the available poetry texts in the AQA English Literature A Level syllabus, while High Windows is offered by the OCR board. Buses in Hull displayed extracts from his poems in 2010.|$|E

2500|$|When {{we try to}} be definite, as to what we {{mean when}} we say that this or that is [...] "the Good," [...] we find {{ourselves}} involved in very great difficulties.
