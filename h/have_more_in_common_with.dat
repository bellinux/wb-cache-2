5|$|MEPs in Parliament are {{organised}} into seven different parliamentary groups, including thirty non-attached members known as non-inscrits. The two largest groups are the European People's Party (EPP) and the Socialists & Democrats (S). These two groups {{have dominated the}} Parliament for much of its life, continuously holding between 50 and 70 percent of the seats between them. No single group has ever held a majority in Parliament. As {{a result of being}} broad alliances of national parties, European group parties are very decentralised and hence <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> parties in federal states like Germany or the United States than unitary states like the majority of the EU states. Nevertheless, the European groups were actually more cohesive than their US counterparts between 2004 and 2009.|$|E

25|$|Adam Helmer was an {{important}} but fictionalized character in Edmonds' novel, Drums Along the Mohawk. Although Helmer's military actions were generally portrayed with accuracy, including his famous run, Edmonds' description of his person varies from historic description. The book pictures Helmer as a large, unschooled, bachelor womanizer with long blonde hair, while historic descriptions indicate he was a lean , married farmer, seeming to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> the book's main character, Gil Martin.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in the Protestant {{colonies of}} {{what would become the}} USA, African slaves and their {{descendants}} were not prohibited from performing their traditional music in New Orleans and the surrounding areas. The African slaves, many from the Caribbean islands, were allowed to gather on Sundays, their day off, on a plaza known as Congo Square. Permitted as early as 1817, dancing in New Orleans had been restricted to the square, which was a hotbed of musical fusion, as African styles from across America and the Caribbean met and danced in large groups, often in circle dances. The Congo Square gatherings became well known, and many whites came to watch and listen. Nevertheless, by 1830, opposition from whites in New Orleans and an influx of blacks elsewhere in the U.S. caused the decline of Congo Square's prominence. The tradition of mass dances in Congo Square continued sporadically, though it came to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> minstrelsy than with authentic African traditions.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, a more {{conventional}} armoured Land Rover was built for the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Wales called the Hotspur. The Land Rover Tangi was built by the Royal Ulster Constabulary's own vehicle engineering team during the 1990s. The British Army has used various armoured Land Rovers, first in Northern Ireland but also in more recent campaigns. They first added protective panels to Series General Service vehicles (the Vehicle Protection Kit (VPK)). Later they procured the Glover Webb APV and finally the Courtaulds (later NP Aerospace) Composite Armoured Vehicle, commonly known as Snatch. These were originally based on heavy-duty V8 110 chassis but some have recently been re-mounted on new chassis from Otokar of Turkey and fitted with diesel engines and air-conditioning for Iraq. Although these now <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> the 'Wolf' (Defender XD) Land Rovers that many mistakenly confuse them with, the Snatch and the Wolf are different vehicles.|$|E

25|$|Fulgentius’s work {{demonstrates}} a clear {{continuation of the}} antique Roman compendium tradition. This concise encyclopaedic style of compiling information was common for Roman writers like Cato the Elder and Cicero. His work {{is also consistent with}} the Stoic and Neoplatonic traditions which interpreted myth as a representation of deeper spiritual processes. His allegorical approach to mythography may have originated in the no-longer-extant Virgil commentary of Aelius Donatus, and it was certainly evident in the later moralising Virgil commentaries of Servius. Fulgentius’s treatment of Virgil as a sage seems to have been borrowed from the encyclopaedic work of Macrobius, the first to elevate the Roman poet to such an authoritative status. However, Fulgentiuss’ tendency to strip classical myth of all its manifest detail and replace it with ethical interpretations appears to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> the late 5th-century writer Martianus Capella. Capella’s work brought the theme of life as a spiritual journey to the forefront of Classical literature, a trend which Fulgentius seemed to carry a step further.|$|E
25|$|All three enclosures, {{the only}} sites {{of this type}} known from the county, are notable for their small size and {{circular}} shape. In national terms their morphology is rather anomalous, a characteristic which can be interpreted {{in a number of}} ways. It has been suggested that they may <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> hengiform monuments of the later Neolithic and early Bronze Age than with 'normal' causewayed enclosures of the fourth millennium BC. Alternatively, they might represent a regional tradition distinct to this part of the country. In addition, the geographical distribution of the sites is confined to north-east Norfolk. While some allowance can be made for the usual factors associated with the distribution of cropmark sites (soils, geology, etc.), at present it seems that the clustering of the three sites in the north-east of the county may be of archaeological significance. The smaller dimensions of the Norfolk sites may be a reflection of the size and dispersal of the communities creating, maintaining and using them and it may not be necessary to assume that they occurred later than elsewhere in Britain. Although at present no excavation has taken place on any of the Norfolk 'causewayed' enclosures so these questions have yet to be answered.|$|E
500|$|Franklin Sumner Earle made C. floccosus {{the type}} {{species of the}} new genus Turbinellus in 1909, in which he placed two other North American species.

500|$|While Errera {{had used}} {{his real name}} for {{previous}} Bungie sites, his cofounder wanted to remain anonymous. At the time, little was known about the new project other than that it was set on a ringworld—a massive ring-shaped habitat. As such, the site founders took aliases from Larry Niven's novel Ringworld; Errera assumed the name [...] "Louis Wu", after the novel's protagonist. Though the universe's Halo megastructures turned out to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> Iain Banks' Orbitals, the aliases stuck {{and it was too}} late to change them. The first Halo trailer was unveiled in July 1999, and the site was renamed. Errera and the other founders searched the web for information and provided a place on Halo.bungie.org for fans to discuss and contribute.|$|E
500|$|The Ichthyosaurus {{models are}} based on Triassic or Jurassic fossils from Europe. Though the three ichthyosaurs are partly in water, they are implausibly shown basking on land like seals. Owen {{supposed}} they resembled crocodiles or plesiosaurs. Better fossil evidence shows that they <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> sharks, having a dorsal fin and fish-like tail, whereas in Hawkins's models the tail is a flat protuberance from a straight backbone. A further discrepancy is that the models' eyes have exposed bony sclerotic plates, Owen conjecturing that with such large eyes they had [...] "great powers of vision, especially in the dusk". They {{became one of the}} three mascots of Crystal Palace Park, along with the Iguanodon and Megalosaurus (although ichthyosaurs are not dinosaurs). The models more closely resemble more basic ichthyosaurs such as Cymbospondylus.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after Thomson's discovery, Hantaro Nagaoka {{predicted}} a different model for electronic structure. Unlike the plum pudding model, the positive charge in Nagaoka's [...] "Saturnian Model" [...] was concentrated into a central core, pulling the electrons into circular orbits reminiscent of Saturn's rings. Few people took notice of Nagaoka's {{work at the}} time, and Nagaoka himself recognized a fundamental defect in the theory even at its conception, namely that a classical charged object cannot sustain orbital motion because it is accelerating and therefore loses energy due to electromagnetic radiation. Nevertheless, the Saturnian model turned out to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> modern theory than any of its contemporaries.|$|E
2500|$|He {{argues that}} a focus on animal welfare, rather than animal rights, may worsen the {{position}} of animals by making the public feel comfortable about using them and entrenching the view of them as property. He calls animal rights groups who pursue animal welfare issues, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the [...] "new welfarists", arguing that they <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> 19th-century animal protectionists than with the animal rights movement; indeed, the terms [...] "animal protection" [...] and [...] "protectionism" [...] are increasingly favored.

2500|$|Some {{regions in}} Texas are more {{associated}} with the Southeast than the Southwest (primarily East Texas, Central Texas, and North Texas), while other regions share more similarities with the Southwest (primarily far West Texas and South Texas).

2500|$|The {{release of}} En la calle (1989) by NG La Banda, marked the {{beginning}} of the post-songo era. This new music shared more with salsa than the Cuban music of the previous decade. Departing from the rumba-inspired percussion parts of the previous songo era, [...] "La expresiva" [...] uses typical salsa bell patterns creatively incorporated into a Cuban-style timbales/drum kit hybrid. The tumbadora ('conga') plays elaborate variations on the son montuno-based tumbao, rather than in the songo style. In contrast to salsa though, NG's bass tumbaos are busier, and rhythmically and harmonically more complex than typically heard in salsa. The breakdown sections in En la calle <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> both the folkloric guaguancó of that time, and hip-hop, than with salsa.|$|E
2500|$|Taine {{argued that}} {{literature}} was largely {{the product of}} the author's environment, and that an analysis of that environment could yield a perfect understanding of the work of literature. In this sense he was a sociological positivist (see Auguste Comte), though with important differences. Taine did not mean race in the specific sense now common, but rather the collective cultural dispositions that govern everyone without their knowledge or consent. What differentiates individuals within this collective [...] "race", for Taine, was milieu: the particular circumstances that distorted or developed the dispositions of a particular person. The [...] "moment" [...] is the accumulated experiences of that person, which Taine often expressed as momentum; to some later critics, however, Taine's conception of moment seemed to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> Zeitgeist.|$|E
2500|$|The {{contact with}} Futurism, {{although}} acknowledged by Urmuz, is judged {{by many of}} his commentators as superficial and delayed. Literary historian Nicolae Balotă first proposed that the Romanian had merely wanted to show his sympathy for (and not a like-mindedness with) Futurism; that the works in question date back before the Futurist Manifesto, to the Cocu period; and that the Bizarre Pages <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> <b>with</b> Expressionism than with Marinetti. According to Cernat: [...] "By the looks of it, [...] were completed largely independent of influence from the European avant-garde movements [...] We do not know, however, {{how many of these}} were already completed in 1909, the year when European Futurism was 'invented'." [...] Emilia Drogoreanu, a researcher of Romanian Futurism, stresses: [...] "The values and representations of [...] world celebrated through Futurism exist within the Urmuzian text, but are entirely uprooted from the significance offered them by [...] ". Although she finds various similarities between Urmuz and Marinetti, Carmen Blaga notes that the former's jadedness was no match for the latter's militancy.|$|E
