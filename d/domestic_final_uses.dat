This paper aims {{to assess the impact}} of economic crisis on China " s energy consumption during the crisis. Contributions of energy efficiency, <b>domestic</b> <b>final</b> <b>use,</b> exports and imports to energy consumption change were clarified using methodology involves structural decomposition analysis based on input-output price model. In 2009, exports of energy -related and raw material sectors were seriously impacted by economic crisis, with energy use dramatically decreased. However, economic stimulus plan implemented by central government provided a great boost to energy consumption growth. According to the study, quantity and structural adjustment of export is one of the important ways to reduce energy consumption in a short time. But in a long term, consumption control and energy efficiency improvement are unsubstitutable...|$|R
40|$|Environmentally {{extended}} {{input-output analysis}} (EEIOA) {{has long been}} used to quantify global and regional environmental impacts and to clarify emission transfers. Structural path analysis (SPA), a technique based on EEIOA, is especially useful for measuring significant flows in this environmental-economic system. This paper constructs an imports-adjusted single-region input-output (SRIO) model considering only <b>domestic</b> <b>final</b> <b>use</b> elements, and it uses the SPA technique to highlight crucial routes along the production chain in both <b>final</b> <b>use</b> and sectoral perspectives. The results indicate that future mitigation policies on house-hold consumption should change direct energy use structures in rural areas, cut unreason-able demand for power and chemical products, and focus on urban areas due to their consistently higher magnitudes than rural areas in the structural routes. Impacts originating from government spending should be tackled by managing onsite energy use in 3 major service sectors and promoting cleaner fuels and energy-saving techniques in the transport sector. Policies on investment should concentrate on sectoral interrelationships along the production chain by setting up standards to regulate upstream industries, especially for th...|$|R
40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{recognized}} {{that there is}} a strong relationship between energy consumption and economic growth. Most countries' energy demands declined during the economic depression of 20082009 when a worldwide economic crisis occurred. As an export-oriented economy, China suffered a serious exports decline {{in the course of the}} crisis. However, it was found that energy consumption continued to increase. Against such a background, this paper aims to assess and explain the factors causing the growth of energy consumption in China. First, we will explain the impact of <b>domestic</b> <b>final</b> <b>use</b> and international trade on energy consumption by using decomposition analysis. Second, embodied energy and its variation across sectors are quantified to identify the key sectors contributing to the growth. Lastly, the policy implications for long-term energy conservation are discussed. The results show that the decline in exports was one of the driving forces for energy consumption reduction in the crisis, but that the growth of domestic demand in manufacturing and construction, largely stimulated by economic stimulus plans, had the opposite effect on energy consumption. International trade contributed to decreasing energy consumption of China during and after the crisis because the structure of exports and imports changed in this period. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|We {{would expect}} the levels of carbon dioxide {{emissions}} per unit of production in non-European Union (EU) countries to be much greater than those in EU countries. Accordingly, {{a reduction in the}} import shares of intermediate inputs and/or final demand of the European economy should lead to more <b>domestic</b> intermediate and <b>final</b> <b>uses</b> and, therefore, to a reduction in the carbon footprint of the European economy when compared with the initial situation. However, we will prove that only when different emission coefficients are considered for non-EU and EU countries, then the European import shares reduction that occurred during the period 2000 – 2006 will be fully captured by carbon footprint analysis. Otherwise, the derived carbon footprint will be distorted {{by the fact that the}} evolution of the import shares will not affect those estimations.

We propose an alternative methodology to capture all three dimensions of import dependency, i. e. origin, destination and policy. The information content of the import dependency matrix is expanded by information on domestic sectors (destination) which demand intermediate imports. Calculations reveal some interesting features of import dependency in Turkey, namely that policy sectors mostly coincide with destination sectors, that oil refinery emerges as a leading destination sector for all, and that raw petroleum is a leading origin sector.

40|$|This paper applies {{structural}} {{decomposition analysis}} to Chinese input – output tables {{in order to}} disentangle and quantify the sources of China’s import growth and China’s growth in vertical specialization: that is, China’s incorporation into the global supply chain. China’s exports {{and the role of}} processing trade therein have increased substantially in the last decade. Yet, they account for only one third of China’s import growth from 1997 to 2005. Instead, the volume growth of China’s <b>domestic</b> <b>final</b> demand is found to be most important. Moreover, compared with other countries, the structural change in input – output coefficients and in the commodity composition of <b>domestic</b> <b>final</b> demand turns out to be surprisingly important. Looking only at vertical specialization, it is concluded {{that more than half of}} its growth, from 21 % in 1997 to 30 % in 2005, is due to the growth of China’s import ratios.
