25|$|In England and Wales, {{the law of}} arms is {{regarded}} {{as a part of the}} laws of England, and the common law courts will take <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> of it as such. These dignities, as they are called, have legal standing. But the law of arms is not part of the common law and the common law Courts have no jurisdiction over matters of dignities and honours, such as armorial bearings, or peerages. In this respect the law of arms was most influenced by the civil law and may be regarded as similar to the ecclesiastical law, which is a part of the laws of England influenced by canon law, but not part of the common law.|$|E

60|$|Not long ago, {{the world}} saw, with thoughtless joy {{which might have}} been very {{thoughtful}} joy, a real miracle not heretofore considered possible or conceivable in the world,--a Reforming Pope. A simple pious creature, a good country-priest, invested unexpectedly with the tiara, takes up the New Testament, declares that this henceforth shall be his rule of governing. No more finesse, chicanery, hypocrisy, or false or foul dealing of any kind: God's truth shall be spoken, God's justice shall be done, on the throne called of St. Peter: an honest Pope, Papa, or Father of Christendom, shall preside there. And such a throne of St. Peter; and such a Christendom, for an honest Papa to preside in! The European populations everywhere hailed the omen; with shouting and rejoicing leading articles and tar-barrels; thinking people listened with astonishment,--not with sorrow if they were faithful or wise; with awe rather as at the heralding of death, and with a joy as of victory beyond death! Something pious, grand and as if awful in that joy, revealing once more the Presence of a Divine Justice in this world. For, to such men it was very clear how this poor devoted Pope would prosper, with his New Testament in his band. An alarming business, that of governing in the throne of St. Peter by the rule of veracity! By the rule of veracity, the so-called throne of St. Peter was openly declared, above three hundred years, ago, to be a falsity, a huge mistake, a pestilent dead carcass, which this Sun was weary of. More than three hundred years ago, the throne of St. Peter received peremptory <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> to quit; authentic order, registered in Heaven's chancery and since legible in the hearts of all brave men, to take itself away,--to begone, and let us have no more to do with it and its delusions and impious deliriums;--and it has been sitting every day since, it may depend upon it, at its own peril withal, and will have to pay exact damages yet for every day it has so sat.

40|$|In June 2016, {{participants}} in a United Kingdom referendum voted to leave the European Union (EU) {{by a margin of}} 52 % to 48 %. The timing and terms of Britain’s exit (commonly known as “Brexit”) are the subject of on-going public and parliamentary debate. But the mechanism by which Brexit is to be formally commenced was clarified by the U. K. Supreme Court at the end of January 2017 in the landmark case R (Miller) v. Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. The question presented was whether ministers of Theresa May’s government could give notice of the U. K. ’s withdrawal from the EU “without prior legislation passed in both Houses of Parliament and assented to by HM The Queen. ” The secretary of state argued that the power to withdraw was part of the royal prerogative exercisable by ministers without prior parliamentary action. However, in light of the far-reaching changes to domestic law that would result from terminating EU membership treaties, the court held that withdrawal “must be made in the only way in which the UK constitution permits, namely through Parliamentary legislation. ” On the one hand, the Miller decision may be seen as a resounding reaffirmation of the principle of parliamentary sovereignty in British constitutional law. Notwithstanding the facts that a majority of voters supported Brexit and that government ministers ordinarily have the power to terminate treaties without legislative approval or <b>judicial</b> review, formal <b>notice</b> of withdrawal under Article 50 of the EU Treaties could not be given unless and until Parliament so agreed. Yet on the other hand, a comparative analysis of Miller also reveals some significant limitations on parliamentary power in the United Kingdom relative to congressional power in the United States—even though Congress is constrained by the Constitution and enjoys no sovereignty over the other branches of government. This Essay explores these limitations on parliamentary power and argues that legislative sovereignty is best understood not as an immutable principle laid down in Britain’s constitutional history, but rather as an evolving ideal that continues to develop to this day...|$|R
40|$|The rise of {{the capital}} market creates new, less {{noticeable}} forms of holdings of shares. These holdings could be acquired {{with the aim of}} influencing a company’s decision-making process without the intention to hold shares for the long term. One of the forms is new vote buying which can appear either as empty voting or as hidden ownership. Empty voting refers to voting by a shareholder without the corresponding financial interest in the company involved. The reverse situation is hidden ownership whereby a party is not the shareholder but is entitled to exercise influence and eventually vote as if he/she were a shareholder. If a shareholder has an ownership interest in the company in which he/she votes, his/her voting would be aligned with the interests of the company. If a shareholder votes for a decision contrary to the company’s interest, it would affect his/her own economic interests because the shares could have been sold even before the shareholder’s meeting occurred. There are many techniques that lead to empty voting. Those most commonly used are: borrowing shares, using equity swaps or buying shares on a date close to the record date and then selling them again right after the record date has elapsed. As a result, a person casting their vote at the general meeting might not be the ‘actual’ shareholder. The admissibility of these votes and their effects have been discussed in well-known <b>judicial</b> cases. Having <b>noticed</b> a rise of abusive situations created by using empty voting techniques at the EU level, the revised Transparency Directive set out to deal with these issues. It entered into force on 26 November 2013 with the deadline for implementation set at 26 November 2015. However, since the Transparency Directive is a minimum harmonisation Directive, Member States have substantial liberty in its implementation which might lead to a divergent level of investor protection. Further, since the development of capital markets leads to the appearance of new forms of derivatives and other financial instruments which could create an ‘empty voting’ effect, EU Member States would be tempted to set rules that would, as far as possible, embrace all forms of empty voting in a so-called ‘catch all’ provision. This paper aims to examine how national legislators of the EU Member States have dealt with the issue of empty voting in light of the solutions provided in the Shareholders Rights Directive of 2007 and in the revised EU Transparency Directive of 2013...|$|R
40|$|Often the Supreme Court {{directly}} engages nonjudicial {{officials in}} a shared elaboration of constitutional rights. It does so {{through the use}} of doctrines that focus on whether nonjudicial actors have taken an appropriately close and sensitive look at policy judgments that threaten important constitutional values. In many of these cases, the Court in effect 2 ̆ 2 remands 2 ̆ 2 constitutionally controversial programs to the political branches [...] inviting a more studied consideration of the program than attended its initial adoption, and leaving open the possibility that the readopted program will be upheld against constitutional attack. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s structural doctrines range from the familiar vagueness rule to the little <b>noticed</b> <b>judicial</b> practice of disregarding statutory justifications no longer relied on by the state. Through the use of these and many other process-centered rules, the Court initiates a dialogue with and among nonjudicial actors, often deferring to decisions of political branches on how to resolve constitutional issues, so long as these decisions bear the earmarks of deliberation and care. These doctrines thus may be called 2 ̆ 2 rights-driven rules of deliberation and dialogue 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 structural safeguards of substantive rights. 2 ̆ 2 In the interest of brevity, I refer to them in this Article simply (and synonymously) as 2 ̆ 2 second-look 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 structural 2 ̆ 2 doctrines or rules. A comprehensive and systematic elaboration of structural rues is what I offer here. More specifically, after further defining the nature of structural review in Part II, I consider in Parts III through XII each of the nine categories of structural rules, {{as well as a number}} of so-called 2 ̆ 2 quasi-structural 2 ̆ 2 rules. I also offer most pointedly in Parts XIII and XIV, but also at other stages along the way, an introduction to a systematic evaluation of the legitimacy and wisdom of structural review. In particular, Part XIII identifies ten arguments that may be made against structural review (for example, that they are inherently unprincipled, surreptitiously activist, and unduly invasive of legislative prerogatives), and then also identifies ten arguments that may be made on their behalf (for example, that they wisely encourage lawmaker care, conserve judicial capital, and alert political decision makers to their own constitutional responsibilities). Part XIV follows up on this discussion by considering in detail the most basic critique of structural rules: namely, that their use is illegitimate because such use is unsupported by constitutional text and tradition. In rebuffing this challenge, this Article suggests, among other things, that structural rules comport with long-accepted process-centered themes in constitutional law and with the Framers 2 ̆ 7 own embrace of the value of 2 ̆ 2 deliberative democracy. 2 ̆...|$|R
