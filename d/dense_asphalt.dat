It was found that cobblestones pavements are the most annoying; also while open asphalt rubber pavement imposes less annoyance than <b>dense</b> <b>asphalt</b> it is not signiﬁcantly different. Higher car speeds always lead to greater annoyance, as does higher trafﬁc densi- ties. LAeq and LAmax correlate well with annoyance, but loudness is the best predictor.

40|$|The present paper {{analyses}} {{the correlation}} between the number of crashes on freeways and weather conditions on <b>dense</b> <b>asphalt</b> and porous asphalt before and after road modernization operations. Data was collected on 43 km of the A 3 freeway located in Southern Italy from the road interchange of Tarsia to the road interchange of South Cosenza. Crash data were made available by the Police Station of North Cosenza, with traffic data from the ANAS Compartment in Cosenza, and the rainfall measurements were provided by the ARPACAL centre in Calabria.

Porous pavement system is a structural and environmental mindful alternative to a traditional pavement system. Safety analyses were carried out correlating the number of crashes to the rainfall detected using two rain gauges, and the traffic data. The results show a considerable dependence of crash frequency on the intensity of rainfall, both in the presence of porous and <b>dense</b> <b>asphalt.</b> In the first case, the accident rate increases to a rainfall of 0. 5 mm/h, and then decreases due to probable greater prudence adopted by drivers in adverse meteorological events.

40|$|The {{standards}} for the environmental quality required by the European Community are very demanding in what concerns traffic noise. The interaction tire/road is undoubtedly {{one of the main}} sources of traffic noise. Nevertheless, standards do not account for the increase in the noise level caused by rain falling onto road surfaces. Therefore, the aim of this work is to study the effects of water on pass-by noise since the weather is rainy about 25 per cent of the year in Portugal. Thus, it addresses two currently used pavement surfaces, porous asphalt and <b>dense</b> <b>asphalt,</b> constructed in a motorway. A version of the Statistical Pass-By Method was used to assess noise levels with dry and wet surfaces, using a selected set of heavy and light vehicles. The results include analysis of the statistical pass-by index, pressure noise levels and noise spectrum. Noise levels increase significantly with the presence of water, shifting the overall noise by 4 dB(A). The benefits of porous asphalt are null for heavy vehicles, particularly at high speeds.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{managing}} storm water with porous or <b>dense</b> graded <b>asphalt</b> pavement {{has been done}} successfully in Minnesota since 2005, and nationally since the 1970 ’s to provide a solution to storm water runoff and groundwater table recharge.

The objective of this research is to have a deep insight of the effect of air voids content on the temperature evolution, transport and storage of heat in asphalt mixture under dry conditions. With this objective, asphalt mixture slabs with different air voids content have been built and their thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, light absorptivity and thermal diffusivity related to their temperature evolution have been measured when they are exposed to infrared light and during the cooling process. It was observed that asphalt mixture with high air voids content exhibited slightly higher steady state temperatures than <b>denser</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixture and that the heating and cooling rates are higher in porous asphalt mixture than in denser materials. The reason for the faster increase and decrease in temperature of porous mixture and for the higher temperature reached by porous asphalt is its lower specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity.

The following conclusions can be made from the investigation:- New <b>dense</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete pavements can give a tyre/road noise level (CPX) of 4 - 8 dB(A) lower noise level, compared to a chosen reference level for a pavement of type AC 0 / 11 and SMA 0 / 11. However, after the first winter season with exposure to studded tyres, the noise levels seems to increase with approximately 3 - 4 dB(A). - Dense asphalt concrete pavements with a smaller maximum chipping size (6 - 8 mm) give a higher initial noise reduction, but is more sensible to winter condition and traffic exposure, than pavements with 11 - 16 mm. - Thin layers tested in the project seem to behave in the same manner as <b>dense</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete pavements.  -    Porous pavements tested in the project gives an initial noise reduction of 5 - 9 dB(A), compared to the           reference level.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of the study was}} to {{discover}} knowledge from data about asphalt road pavement problems to achieve a better understanding of the behavior of them and via this understanding improve pavement quality and enhance its lifespan. Four pavement problems were chosen to be investigated; raveling of Porous Asphalt Concrete (PAC), cracking of <b>Dense</b> <b>Asphalt</b> Concrete (DAC), rutting of <b>dense</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete, and determination of the stiffness of Cement Treated Bases (CTBs). At the moment, almost 75 % of the Dutch motorways network has a PAC top layer. Raveling is the most dominant type of damage of PAC top layers. The DAC top layers which are mainly applied to the secondary roads in the Netherlands are the most commonly used top layers worldwide. The two main damage types of this top layer are cracking and rutting. Determination of the stiffness of the cement treated base layer stiffness is not an easy task. Therefore, a tool which can accurately calculate the stiffness of such base layers is desirable. Concerning data, the SHRP-NL databases provided the data for the three surface damages, being ravelling of PAC, cracking and rutting of DAC. The data for climate and traffic were obtained from databases of the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI), the Ministry of Transport and Water Management, and different provinces of the Netherlands. The data for the stiffness of CTBs was simulated using the multilayer linear-elastic computer program BISAR. During preparation of the data, the determination of outliers was a challenging task. Due to the low number of data points available for raveling, cracking, and rutting (in one case around 70 data points), an extensive variable selection was performed using eight different methods: decision trees, genetic polynomial, artificial neural network, rough set theory, correlation based variable selection with bidirectional and genetic search, wrappers of neural network with genetic search, and relief ranking filter. For development of models (data mining) from the mentioned data, four machine learning based techniques were employed. Two were prediction techniques; artificial neural networks and support vector machines. The other two were rule based techniques; decision trees and rough set theory.

The surface of the rigid pavement is much stiffer than the surface of the asphalt pavement and is customarily constructed directly over the base course (sometimes without having a subbase layer underneath).

Blisters may form under both the waterproofing <b>dense</b> mastic <b>asphalt</b> layer or under the waterproofing membrane which is often applied as additional water protection under the mastic asphalt (MA). One of the main technical issues is the formation of blisters under the membrane and asphalt-covered concrete structures caused by a complex mechanism governed by bottom-up pressure and loss of adhesion. A linear viscoelastic finite-element model was developed to simulate time-dependent blister growth in a <b>dense</b> mastic <b>asphalt</b> layer under uniformly applied pressure with and without temperature and pressure fluctuation. A finite element model was developed using ABAQUS with linear viscoelastic properties and validated with a closed form solution from first-order shear-deformation theory for thick plates. In addition, the blister test was conducted on different samples of MA in the laboratory and digital image correlation measurement technique was used to capture the three-dimensional vertical deflection of the MA over time. It {{was found that the}} blister may grow continuously under repeated loading conditions over subsequent days. With respect to blistering under waterproofing membranes, mechanical elastic modeling and experimental investigations were performed for three different types of membranes under in-plane stress state. The orthotropic mechanical behavior of a polymer modified bitumen membrane (PBM) was determined from biaxial test data. Finally, blister tests by applying controlled pressure between orthotropic PBMs and concrete plates were performed for studying the elliptical adhesive blister propagation using digital 3 D image correlation. The energy calculated from elliptical blister propagation was found comparable to the adhesive fracture energy from standard peeling tests for similar types of PBMs. This indicates that the peeling test assists to evaluate and rank the adhesive properties of different types of membranes with respect to blister formation at room temperature without conducting time consuming and complicated pressurized blister propagation tests using digital 3 D image correlation.

Fatigue characterization using any model must recognize that controlled load or dis-placement will induce significantly different fatigue lives in laboratory tests. When those lives must be correlated to actual field performance the magnitude and the accuracy of the shift factor is strongly affected by the mode of load selected in the laboratory material characterization phase. Asphalt-Rubber Hot-Mix (ARHM) has shown a higher resistance to flexural than con-ventional <b>Dense</b> Graded <b>Asphalt</b> Concrete (DGAC). This paper presents the results of four point flexural fatigues tests performed under load and under displacement control on conventional and asphalt rubber mixes and investigates the applicability of an intrinsic damage law in light of the observed experience...|$|R

Such soft materials {{need time to}} stabilise its performances and short-term loading can drive to large deterioration of the applied layer. The effects of wheel tread turning and rubbing on asphalt surface have to be understood. In order to do that, the tribological behaviour of an asphalt surface is studied using an apparatus that can load a sample surface simultaneously in compression and torsion. The paper describes the technical details and {{the design of the}} apparatus, followed by a description of the adopted experimental test protocol. Tests are realised with imposed normal load and rotation rate of a disc. The adhesion and friction stresses are calculated from torque measurement. The displacement of sample surface during torsion is recorded. The value of this parameter {{at the end of the}} test appears as a useful degradation indicator. Performing tests during ageing of sample enlighten us on the stabilisation of the performances. The interpretation of results is illustrated by tests carried out on porous cold-mix asphalt that is particularly sensitive...|$|R
