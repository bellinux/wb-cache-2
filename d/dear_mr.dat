25|$|Following his death, several tributes {{in celebration}} of Capaldi's life and music came out under the name <b>Dear</b> <b>Mr</b> Fantasy. The first was a tribute concert that {{took place at the}} Roundhouse in Camden Town, London on Sunday, 21 January 2007.

25|$|After {{receiving}} both Golden Globe and Primetime Emmy Awards for her {{portrayal of}} Harper Pitt on the HBO television miniseries Angels in America in 2003, Parker {{went on to}} enjoy large success as Nancy Botwin, the lead role on the Showtime television series Weeds, which ran from 2005 to 2012 and for which she received three nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series between 2007 and 2009 and received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy in 2006. Her more recent film appearances have included roles in The Spiderwick Chronicles (2008), Red (2010), R.I.P.D. (2013) and Red 2 (2013), as well as continued stage and television appearances.

500|$|Nielsen's {{philosophy}} of music style is perhaps {{summed up in}} his advice in a 1907 letter to the Norwegian composer Knut Harder: [...] "You have... fluency, so far, so good; but I advise you again and again, my <b>dear</b> <b>Mr.</b> Harder; Tonality, Clarity, Strength.|$|E

Come {{whenever}} you please, <b>dear</b> <b>Mrs</b> Denman. Yes, yes, time does indeed fly, as you say; or as my friend, Sir Archibald What's-his-name used to remark, `Tempit fugus something re-what's-'is-name.' Good-bye, <b>dear</b> <b>Mrs</b> Denman." ...|$|R
500|$|Reckitt and Colman {{approached}} Stanley Wagner to buy Coldcrops, {{and after}} a very long negotiation a deal was concluded. A letter from Barclays Bank dated 21 June 1956 reads [...] " [...] <b>Dear</b> <b>Mr</b> Wagner, I have pleasure in enclosing two copies of the Draft for £......... credited to your account, which the Bank will be pleased if you will accept as a souvenir of this most successful transaction". The deal transferred ownership of the packaging and concept from Coldcrops to Reckitt & Coleman, and the new Jif-brand lemon juice was launched in 1956. All parties were delighted, Stanley Wagner with a substantial sum of money, for those days and a large profit from the six million lemons that had been sold, Reckitt's even more so because the negotiating team had permission to pay far more for the business than {{they were able to}} achieve. Lemon farmers in Sicily were also pleased, because the demand had increased for Sicilian lemon juice, which was largely a by-product of Sicilian lemon oil production. For many years, whilst producing lemon oil, Sicilians had found little use for the juice. Now there was a rapidly growing market for their near-waste product. In 1970, Jif continued to be prepared with lemon juice from Sicily. Later on, Unilever acquired the Jif brand in 1995 for the price of £250m, when it purchased Colman's of Norwich.|$|E
500|$|Horner's ruse of {{impotence}} {{is a great}} success, and he has {{sex with}} many ladies of virtuous reputation, mostly the wives and daughters of citizens or [...] "cits", i.e. upwardly mobile businessmen and entrepreneurs of the City of London, {{as opposed to the}} Town, the aristocratic quarters where Horner and his friends live. Three such ladies appear on stage, usually together: Lady Fidget, her sister-in-law Mrs Dainty Fidget, and her tag-along friend Mrs Squeamish names that convey both a delicate sensitivity about the jewel of reputation, and a certain fidgety physical unease or tickle and the dialogue gives an indefinite impression of many more. The play is structured as a farce, driven by Horner's secret and by a succession of near-discoveries of the truth, from which he extricates himself by aplomb and good luck. A final hair-raising threat of exposure comes in the last scene, through the well-meaning frankness of the young country wife Margery Pinchwife. Margery is indignant at the accusations of impotence directed at [...] "poor <b>dear</b> <b>Mr.</b> Horner", which she knows from personal experience to be untrue, and is intent on saying so at the traditional end-of-the-play public gathering of the entire cast. In a final trickster masterpiece, Horner averts the danger, joining forces with his more sophisticated lovers to persuade the jealous Pinchwife to at least pretend to believe Horner impotent and his own wife still innocent. Horner never becomes a reformed character but is assumed to go on reaping the fruits of his planted misinformation, past the last act and beyond.|$|E

2500|$|In 1976, Getty's father died. Over {{the next}} decade Getty {{suffered}} from depression and, in a final attempt to end his drug addiction, checked himself into a London clinic in 1984. While there he received {{a visit from the}} then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to thank him for large donations to the National Gallery. She reportedly helped speed his recovery by telling him, [...] "My <b>dear</b> <b>Mr.</b> Getty, we mustn't let things get us down, must we? We'll have you out of here as soon as possible." [...] During a low period in the 1970s Getty had been cheered up by the former England cricketer and later President of the MCC, Gubby Allen, having previously been introduced to the game by Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones.|$|E
2500|$|Roosevelt's order came {{three days}} after Hitler broke the non-aggression pact and invaded the Soviet Union, at which time the Communist Party quickly {{directed}} its members to get behind the draft and forbade participation in strikes {{for the duration of}} the war (angering some leftists). Copies of Songs for John Doe were removed from sale, and the remaining inventory destroyed, though a few copies may exist in the hands of private collectors. The Almanac Singers' Talking Union album, on the other hand, was reissued as an LP by Folkways (FH 5285A) in 1955 and is still available. The following year, the Almanacs issued <b>Dear</b> <b>Mr.</b> President, an album in support of Roosevelt and the war effort. The title song, [...] "Dear Mr. President", was a solo by Pete Seeger, and its lines expressed his lifelong credo: ...|$|E

2500|$|In recent years, as {{the aging}} Seeger began to garner awards and {{recognition}} for his lifelong activism, {{he also found}} himself criticized once again for his opinions and associations of the 1930s and 1940s. In 2006, David Boaz—Voice of America and NPR commentator {{and president of the}} libertarian Cato Institute—wrote an opinion piece in The Guardian, entitled [...] "Stalin's Songbird" [...] in which he excoriated The New Yorker and The New York Times for lauding Seeger. He characterized Seeger as [...] "someone with a longtime habit of following the party line" [...] who had only [...] "eventually" [...] parted ways with the CPUSA. In support of this view, he quoted lines from the Almanac Singers' May 1941 Songs for John Doe, contrasting them darkly with lines supporting the war from <b>Dear</b> <b>Mr.</b> President, issued in 1942, after the United States and the Soviet Union had entered the war.|$|E
2500|$|Transferred to Supreme Army Command as Chief of Staff to the Quartermaster General {{at the end}} of April 1918, Thaer {{reported}} to Hindenburg and Ludendorff on 1 May 1918. [...] He had already resolved that he would report openly on the frontline situation to the two men running the war. [...] By that criterion he failed. [...] The field-marshall hero of Tannenberg was sympathetic: [...] "My <b>dear</b> <b>Mr</b> von Thaer, your nerves have certainly been affected by the last few terrible weeks through which you have come. [...] I think that the good spirits at Supreme Army Command will soon set you right". [...] Thaer encountered a similar, if less avuncular, reaction a little later when he {{reported to}} First Quartermaster General Erich von Ludendorff: [...] "What's your game? [...] What {{do you want me to}} do? [...] Should I now make peace at any price?" [...] Thaer replied: [...] "Excellence, I said nothing about that. [...] Ot is my duty - and it is a very painful duty - to point out that the condition of our troops is not going to improve, but will continue slowly to deteriorate". [...] Ludendorff persisted: [...] "If the condition of our troops is getting worse, if discipline is deteriorating, then that is your fault and the fault of all those field commanders who do not get it. [...] How else can it be that entire divisions can found too drunk to fight, unable to implement the necessary advances. [...] That is the explanation for the great March offensive, and now [...] Operation Georgette, not progressing further.|$|E
