40|$|The Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) is {{currently}} experiencing a crippling traffic congestion problem. With an average daily commute time of 82 minutes, residents experience {{some of the}} longest commute times in North America (Metrolinx, 2008 c, 2013 a). The region is also facing explosive growth in its population and economy. It {{is expected to grow}} from roughly 6. 5 million people today to 9 million by 2031. Several forces have contributed to the current congestion problem including: population growth, a lack of spending on transit infrastructure and operations, low-density development and a lack of co-ordination between land-use and transportation planning. This study asks: as population growth in the GTHA continues, how might we encourage a positive shift in modal split to mitigate traffic congestion? The problem is a wicked problem, and is essentially the symptom of several other problems. To address the complexity, a qualitative mixed-methods approach has been applied. Key informant interviews were held with planners, politicians, business leaders, and transportation advocates to understand local impacts, solutions and barriers. Next, a Policy Delphi was utilized to seek input from a panel of international experts on best practices. Finally, a local Design Charrette was held to seek creative ideas from a group of professionals and other participants. This study finds strong local support for the priority actions referred to as the Nine Big Moves of the regional transportation plan. However it also identifies a gap, in that the plan is missing a transportation demand management (TDM) policy with a <b>fiscal</b> <b>element</b> to manage demand. Without this, the supply-side techniques proposed by the Big Move will have limited success in mitigating congestion in a growing region. RECOMMENDATIONS: This study recommends the pursuit of a road pricing policy to be included in transportation plans – a policy which would replace the gas tax and charge road users a varying rate (peak/off-peak) for every kilometer that they drive. It would act as a dis-incentive to auto use, encouraging a shift in trips to alternate modes, routes, or times of the day. As a bonus, it could also generate funds to be re-invested in the transportation network. This would be the tenth Big Move which pulls together the other nine priority actions already in play. It is recommended that such a program could be implemented through a trial, first initiated with a pilot...|$|E

40|$|Often enough, the {{definitions}} in tax regulations are not unique, {{and they can}} differ even within the fiscal legislation from one title to another. Thus the accounting regulations define the net turnover tax code, {{but at the same}} time it brings different definitions of turnover in terms of added value. The turnover for professionals in accounting is an indicator used to represent the value and the synthetic of the achieved sales by an economic unit during a certain period or a business segment. Also the <b>fiscal</b> <b>elements</b> come to generate a new identity of the taxable result, totally different from the accounting result. There are found clear value differences between accounting and tax perspective on the outcome in terms of operating profit and expenses. These differences at the level of operating costs continue to affect key indicators of the structure of the profit account and loss until determining the gross profit, which differs in the accounting vision compared to the gross profit in the fiscal vision...|$|R
40|$|Both {{monetary}} and <b>fiscal</b> <b>elements</b> {{have been shown}} to contribute to the inflationary dynamics in Turkey over the last three decades. Moreover Turkey is a highly dollarized economy. In the literature it is shown that inflation causes dollarization in an economy with fiscal deficits through the actions of economic agents trying to evade from the inflation tax imposed by the financing of the deficit. In this paper, we aim to show the direct effect of dollarization on inflation which is a new approach in the literature. We employ the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) modeling and the bounds testing approach to cointegration analysis to estimate an inflation equation for Turkey taking into consideration both {{monetary and}} fiscal variables as well as a dollarization variable. Our results indicate the importance of dollarization in explaining the behavior of inflation both in the short-run and in the long-run among other elements like monetary growth and exchange rate depreciation...|$|R

40|$|This work {{provides}} a {{critical analysis of}} the expansionary austerity theory (EAT). The {{focus is on the}} theoretical weaknesses of the EAT—the extreme circumstances and fragile assumptions under which expansionary consolidations might take place. The paper presents a simple theoretical model based on both the post-Keynesian and the evolutionary/institutionalist schools. First, it shows that well-designed austerity measures hardly trigger short-run economic expansions in the context of expected long-lasting consolidation plans dealing with remarkably high debt-to-GDP ratios, when the so-called “financial channel” is not operative (i. e. in the context of monetarily sovereign economies), or when the degree of export responsiveness to internal devaluation is low. Even in the context of non–monetarily sovereign countries (e. g. members of the eurozone), austerity’s effectiveness crucially depends on its highly disputable capacity to immediately stabilize fiscal variables. The paper then analyses some possible long-run economic dynamics. Path dependency and cumulativeness make the short-run effects of <b>fiscal</b> consolidation <b>elements</b> of paramount importance to (hopefully) obtaining any medium-to-long-run benefit. Should these effects be even slightly contractionary, short-run costs can breed an endless spiral of recession and ballooning debt in the long run. If so, in the case of non–monetarily sovereign countries debt forgiveness may emerge as the ultimate solution to restore economic soundness. Alternatively, institutional innovations like those adopted since mid- 2012 by the European Central Bank are required to stabilize the economy, even though they are unlikely to restore rapid growth in the absence of more active fiscal stimuli...|$|R

40|$|The author {{discusses}} {{the revolution in}} public sector thinking that is transforming the public sectors of developing and transition countries. Countries are reconsidering their fiscal systems and searching for the right balance between central government control and decentralized governance. Political decentralization has advanced in most countries. Subnational expenditures in developing countries {{as a percentage of}} total public expenditures have also increased over the past two decades. However, the process is far from complete. In many countries, the central government is still involved in the delivery of local services, local governments have few sources of own-revenues, local governments have limited access to borrowing for capital projects, and the design of intergovernmental transfers does neither address regional fiscal equity nor convey appropriate incentives for fiscal discipline, improved service delivery performance, and accountability to citizens. Decentralized public governance can help realign public sector incentives through greater accountability to citizens, and attenuate the"democracy deficit"caused by globalization and the role of supranational institutions and regimes. However, this requires careful examination of the entire <b>fiscal</b> system. <b>Elements</b> of a comprehensive package of fiscal system reforms would include: (a) Clarifying roles of various levels of government in public service delivery; (b) Reassigning taxing responsibilities to ensure local revenue autonomy, accountability, and efficiency without endangering an internal common market; (c) Designing fiscal transfers to ensure regional fiscal equity and to create an enabling environment for innovative and competitive service delivery; (d) Facilitating responsible credit market access to subnational governments; (e) Designing institutional arrangements for intergovernmental fiscal relations to better coordinate policies; and (f) Aligning operational capacity with the authorizing environment through the"accountability for results"framework of public management.

The author examines the rationale for a specific rural focus in poverty reduction programs and reviews recent attempts to encourage rural development. He discusses the role decentralization could play in rural development programs and analyzes recent efforts to implement decentralized rural development programs. The author concludes that although decentralization initiatives have a long history, much {{more needs to be}} understood about various components of decentralization before sound advice can be given to policymakers. He suggests a conceptual model - based on a"souffle"theory of decentralization - that incorporates the essential <b>elements</b> of political, <b>fiscal,</b> and institutional decentralization as they related to rural development outcomes. Like a souffle that requires just the right combination of milk, eggs, and heat to rise, a successful program of decentralization must include just the right combination of political, <b>fiscal,</b> and institutional <b>elements</b> to improve rural development outcomes.

40|$|Theory {{suggests}} {{that government should}} {{as far as possible}} smooth taxes and its recurrent consumption spending, which means that government debt should act as a shock absorber, and any planned adjustments in debt should be gradual. This {{suggests that}} operational targets for governments (e. g. for 5 years ahead) should involve deficits rather than debt, because such rules will be more robust to shocks. Beyond that, fiscal rules need to reflect the constraints on monetary policy, {{and the extent to which}} governments are subject to deficit bias. Fiscal rules for countries in a monetary union or fixed exchange rate regime need to include a strong countercyclical <b>element.</b> <b>Fiscal</b> rules should also contain a ‘knock out’ if interest rates hit the zero lower bound: in that case the fiscal and monetary authorities should cooperate to formulate a fiscal expansion package that allows interest rates to rise above this bound. In more normal times, the design of fiscal policy rules is likely to depend on the extent to which governments are subject to deficit bias, and the effectiveness of any national fiscal council. For example, governments that had not shown a history of deficit bias could aim to target deficits five years ahead (rolling targets), and these would not require cyclical adjustment. In contrast, governments that were more prone to bias could target a cyclically adjusted deficit at the end of their expected period of office. In both cases fiscal councils would have an important role to play, in ensuring plans were implemented in the first case and allowing for departures from target when external shocks occurred in the second...|$|R

The need for school-level financial reporting accelerated during the 1990 s as public-school stakeholders continually expressed concern over the manner in which school districts allocated resources. District-level fiscal data were insufficient in addressing such issues as equity, adequacy, and student achievement. School-level fiscal reporting provides educational decision makers with a clearer view of a school's operation and resource allocation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop school-level financial guidelines for Illinois public school districts by analyzing fiscal reporting documents from states currently collecting school-level data. The qualitative research method was used for this study. Through document analysis design, the study identified current reporting practices from states collecting school-level fiscal data. The study explored the implementation of school-level reporting in Illinois by examining current data collection methods, the need to collect additional data, and whether increased district resources would be necessary to collect and maintain the data. Also, the benefits of school-level fiscal reporting for Illinois public school stakeholders were discussed. The study revealed that 15 states currently require school-level <b>fiscal</b> reporting. Key <b>elements</b> of school-site reporting included the need to redesign the account code structure and collect specific staff and student nonfiscal data. A clear focus on how the data are to be used would determine the type of fiscal information to be collected and encourage acceptance of the new reporting model by school-district personnel. School-level fiscal reporting gives public-school officials and policymakers more and better information to use when evaluating instructional programs and services for students. This study recommends that Illinois public school districts collect fiscal data at the school site for the purpose of reporting costs associated with the instruction of students. System-wide expenses are to remain as district-level costs and reported as such. As a result of this study, a new account code structure for school-level fiscal reporting in Illinois was developed...|$|R
40|$|Innovation in postsecondary {{education}} {{has become an}} important element of the landscape in order for institutions to remain competitive and, for some, as a means to survive (Selingo, 2013, p. 58). Small colleges and universities have experienced a more significant impact than most higher education institutions in attempting to remain competitive and promote innovation as they continue to deal with the aftermath of the 2001 and 2008 recessions and keep pace with the challenges of enrollment and finance. If small colleges are faced with the inability to create new and innovative delivery and business models, there is a danger that many of these small colleges will cease to exist (Crow, 2010; Rivard, 2013). ^ The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to explore how two small colleges adopted innovative strategies that maintained or improved their fiscal strength during a time when most small colleges were experiencing financial decline. How these innovative cultures have been supported at these small colleges, and their relation to the strategies employed, is also explored in this study. The overarching research question for this study was, “To what extent can small colleges develop a culture that supports innovation and positively influences the financial stability of the institutions?^ The findings of this study include innovative strategies used at each institution to impact <b>fiscal</b> strength, and <b>elements</b> that have been established to support a culture of innovation in addition to the way in which innovation has improved the student experience. Ultimately, the examples of innovative strategies implemented at these institutions, such as responding to student and market demands, having an innovative mission and vision and ensuring innovative individuals are leading the institution, could turn into sustainable solutions for other small colleges that may be struggling with student enrollment and revenue decline. The elements of innovative cultures that were discovered in this study could be used as a “best practices” list for other small colleges in their quest to develop and sustain an innovative culture. ...|$|R
40|$|Présentation de l'éditeur : The {{reduction}} of inequalities {{within and between}} countries stands as a policy goal, and deserves to take centre stage {{in the design of}} the Sustainable Development Goals agreed during the Rio+ 20 Summit in 2012. The 2013 edition of A Planet for Life represents a unique international initiative grounded on conceptual and strategic thinking, and - most importantly - empirical experiments, conducted on five continents and touching on multiple realities. This unprecedented collection of works proposes a solid empirical approach, rather than an ideological one, to inform future debate. The case studies collected in this volume demonstrate the complexity of the new systems required to accommodate each country's specific economic, political and cultural realities. These systems combine technical, financial, legal, <b>fiscal</b> and organizational <b>elements</b> with a great deal of applied expertise, and are articulated within a clear, well-understood, growth- and job-generating development strategy. Inequality reduction does not occur by decree; neither does it automatically arise through economic growth, nor through policies that equalize incomes downward via ill conceived fiscal policies. Inequality reduction involves a collaborative effort that must motivate all concerned parties, one that constitutes a genuine political and social innovation, and one that often runs counter to prevailing political and economic forces.
