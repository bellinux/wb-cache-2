5|$|On 2 March 1991 the 24th Infantry Division would {{participate}} in a controversial engagement against the Republican Guard Hammurabi Division. It would take place well after the ceasefire. It {{is known as the}} Battle of Rumaila. Iraqi Republican Guard forces were engaged within the Hammar Marshes of the Tigris–Euphrates river system in Iraq while attempting to reach and cross the Lake Hammar causeway and escape northward toward Baghdad on Highway 8. Most of the five-mile-long Iraqi caravan of several hundred vehicles was first boxed into a <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> and then {{in the course of the}} next five hours systematically devastated by the U.S. 24th Infantry Division, including its armored forces, by AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, and nine artillery battalions.|$|E
5|$|In December, Longstreet's First Corps {{played the}} decisive {{role in the}} Battle of Fredericksburg. Since Lee moved Longstreet to Fredericksburg early, it allowed Longstreet {{to take the time}} to dig in {{portions}} of his line, methodically site artillery, and set up a <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> over the axis of advance he thought the Union attack would follow. Remembering the slaughter at Antietam, in which the Confederates did not construct defensive works, Longstreet ordered trenches, abatis, and fieldworks to be constructed, which would set a precedent for future defensive battles by the Army of Northern Virginia. Subsequently, Longstreet positioned his men behind a stone wall at the foot of Marye's Heights and held off fourteen assaults by Union forces. The Union army suffered almost 8,000 casualties at Marye's Heights, Longstreet only 1,000. His great defensive success was not based entirely on the advantage of terrain; this time it was the combination of terrain, defensive works, and a centralized coordination of artillery.|$|E
5|$|However, {{as soon as}} the {{soldiers}} from the 30th and 33rd Ranger Battalions arrived at the landing zone, they were quickly overwhelmed by the Viet Cong in a deadly ambush. The entire 30th Ranger Battalion was then committed to join the attack, but they too did not initially succeed in penetrating the strong Viet Cong defensive lines. Several more companies of the Rangers then arrived for an attack from multiple directions. Two companies of the 33rd Ranger Battalion advanced from the northeast. One of them came to the outskirts of the village, but was unable to break through the enemy defenses. The other one, trying to outflank the enemy, had been lured into a <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> in open terrain and were quickly obliterated in an ambush by the three VC battalions using heavy weapons. The two companies suffered a 70 percent casualty rate, and survivors were forced to retreat to the nearby Catholic church. The 30th Rangers had more success by assaulting from the western direction and succeeded in fighting their way into the village, aided by local residents. It however also suffered heavy losses, with the battalion commander and his American adviser severely wounded. The local civilians in Bình Giã retrieved weapons and ammunition from the dead Rangers, and hid the wounded government soldiers from the Viet Cong. The 38th Ranger Battalion, on the other hand, landed on the battlefield unopposed by the Viet Cong, and they immediately advanced on Bình Giã from the south. Soldiers from the 38th Rangers spent the whole day fighting, but they could not break through their enemies' defences to link up with the survivors hiding in the church, and fell back after calling in mortar fire to decimate Viet Cong fighters moving to encircle them.|$|E

25|$|L-shaped ambushes {{included}} {{the most effective}} aspects of both the 'Bloody Nose' and Linear ambush. The short end, or base, of the 'L' was positioned so {{that at least one}} machine gun could fire straight down the <b>kill</b> <b>zone,</b> enfilading it. Parallel to the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> and tied into the 'L' was a second, flanking ambush.|$|E
25|$|On 24 May 2006, {{while under}} intense enemy fire, Master Corporal Collin Ryan Fitzgerald, PPCLI, entered and re-entered a burning platoon vehicle, driving {{it off the}} roadway and {{allowing}} the other vehicles trapped in the enemy's <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> to break free, {{for which he was}} awarded the Medal of Military Valour.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of {{when the}} {{depository}} building was sealed off by police range from 12:33 to 12:50p.m. The Dealey Plaza immediate area streets and blocks were never sealed-off, and nine minutes after the assassination, photographs show that vehicles were still driving unhampered down Elm Street, through the crime scene <b>kill</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Post {{production}} of the album consisted of cutting the record down from 25 tracks to 19 tracks. The six tracks left off of the final album were <b>Killing</b> <b>Zone,</b> Stranded, Trouble, Road To Hell, Warfare, and Squatter House. <b>Killing</b> <b>Zone</b> and Stranded were used as b-sides and bonus tracks for the record. Trouble was reworked and released as a single on Pink's third album Try This. That version of the song won Tim Armstrong and Pink a Grammy. Road to Hell was re-recorded and a Japanese bonus track on the 2nd Lars Frederiksen And The Bastards album Viking. Warfare and Squatter House remain unreleased.|$|R

50|$|Bad Day is an {{independent}} British film starring Claire Goose, Donna Air, Sarah Harding, Anthony Ofoegbu and Robbie Gee. It is the latest feature film from director Ian David Diaz, whose past films include The <b>Killing</b> <b>Zone,</b> Dead Room and Fallen Angels.|$|R
25|$|The 'L' shaped ambush {{could also}} provide its own flank security. The {{base of the}} 'L' might be placed along either flank of the ambush position, not to fire into the <b>kill</b> <b>zone,</b> but to ambush enemy units that were {{attempting}} to flank the main ambush position along obvious avenues of approach.|$|E
25|$|A road bend was {{included}} in the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> so {{that the end of the}} column was out of sight of the head of the column when the ambush was sprung. Interruption of a column's front-to-rear line of sight increased the likelihood that the head and tail of the column would split and try to fight separately.|$|E
25|$|In some {{situations}} the enemy located a reserve unit {{in line with}} the vertical bar of the 'L' forming a 'T' ambush. After the ambush was sprung, the enemy maneuvered his reserves to block the enemy line of withdrawal. The reserves either close assaulted or set up another ambush along the first linear obstacle to the immediate rear of the <b>kill</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{size and}} sophistication of an ambush varied from hasty meeting engagements, to full scale, {{carefully}} planned, regimental sized ambushes that included forces sufficient to encircle {{the enemy in}} the <b>kill</b> <b>zone.</b> In instances where smaller units didn't have enough troops to stage a complete five-element ambush they would set {{up one of the}} preferred ambush types and avoided close assaulting the enemy.|$|E
25|$|Usually laid along a road, the 'Z' ambush {{was both}} {{effective}} and confusing {{to the unit}} being ambushed. This complicated ambush was usually well planned with low bunkers lining the <b>kill</b> <b>zone,</b> often prepared {{months prior to the}} ambush. The ambush position was only occupied after word was received that an enemy battalion or larger unit would be using the road, which passed through the ambush site.|$|E
25|$|This {{was one of}} the {{simplest}} to set up and operate and was most commonly used by the NVA. It was also easy to get into and away from quickly. The ambush position was laid parallel to the target area. Mines or other obstacles were placed {{on the other side of}} the ambush site. Upon command, fire was brought to bear on the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> from multiple, overlapping firing positions. The linear ambush pumped bullets into the flank of a surprised enemy column.|$|E

2500|$|On March 18, 2003, {{two days}} after Corrie's death, Joe (Smith) Carr was interviewed by British Channel 4 and The Observer {{reporter}} Sandra Jordan for a documentary, The <b>Killing</b> <b>Zone,</b> which aired in June 2003. He stated, [...] "It was either a really gross mistake or a really brutal murder." ...|$|R
25|$|One {{important}} feature of the ambush was that the target units should 'pile up' after being attacked, thus preventing them any easy means of withdrawal from the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> and hindering their use of heavy weapons and supporting fires. Terrain was usually selected which would facilitate this and slow down the enemy. The terrain around the ambush site which was not favorable to the ambushing force, or which offered some protection to the target, was heavily mined and booby trapped or pre-registered for mortars.|$|E
25|$|On 21 February, Captain Winecoff {{received}} {{a message from}} Colonel Barrow, 9th Marines Commanding Officer, {{to set up an}} ambush along Route 922. The Captain's men needed rest, and he requested a postponement but was denied by Colonel Barrow. The Captain utilized his 1st and 2nd Platoons, and at 16:10, 1st Platoon moved out and made its way to 2nd Platoon's position. At 18:30, Winecoff briefed his men on the ambush. After dark they moved out towards route 922, about 900 meters away. By 01:00, Captain Winecoff and Hotel Company were in place and setting up the ambush. Within minutes of getting into position they started hearing trucks coming down the road and continued to observe as 40 minutes later, a lone truck and one PAVN soldier also walked through the <b>kill</b> <b>zone.</b> Winecoff had not wanted the ambush sprung on one truck or soldier, realizing that eventually a bigger target would come down the road. At 02:30, the lights of eight trucks appeared, and as three trucks came into the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> the column of vehicles stopped. Not wanting to give away the ambush or their position Winecoff, set off the claymores and the ambush. The Marines poured small arms and automatic weapons fire on the three vehicles, the forward observer alerted the artillery, and rounds bracketed the company position.|$|E
25|$|Positioned {{with its}} open mouth toward the enemy advance, {{this was a}} {{favorite}} of the VC. It was used in both fairly open terrain as well as jungle. The ambushers, in good concealment along the legs of the 'V', would wait until the enemy point had passed and then creep close to the trail. The 'V' ambush was virtually undetectable by enemy point or flank security until at least a portion of the enemy force was in the <b>kill</b> <b>zone.</b> Enfilading fire was often directed down the enemy axis of advance, and interlocking fire from each leg across the 'V'. The 'V' ambush also lent itself to the use of controlled mines and booby traps.|$|E
50|$|<b>Killing</b> <b>Zone</b> is a {{fighting}} video game developed by Scarab {{and published by}} Naxat Soft in March 1996 in Japan and by Acclaim in both July 1996 in North America, and September 1996 in Europe and Oceania, for the Sony PlayStation platform. The game was met with a poor critical reception.|$|R

50|$|MANPADS {{therefore}} {{became even}} more lethal specifically against more vulnerable platforms such as helicopters, light aircraft, and commercial and military transport aircraft (during approaches and departures). The slower speed of these platforms forces them {{to spend more time}} within the <b>kill</b> <b>zones</b> of MANPADS compared to high performance fighter and strike aircraft.|$|R
25|$|Later that afternoon, the company's 2nd Platoon was ambushed {{by a large}} NVA unit, {{suffering}} heavy casualties, while conducting reconnaissance near Nui Yon Hill. As airstrikes were attacking nearby NVA, McCloughan {{entered a}} trench and saw two unarmed American soldiers huddling near a bush. He handed his gun to another soldier, jumped over the trench's berm, and ran {{close to the ground}} towards the two soldiers, whom he pulled back into the trench despite being hit with shrapnel from the explosion of a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG). Ignoring an order to remain in the trench, he rescued wounded soldiers from the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> four more times during a NVA assault. Bleeding heavily, McCloughan treated the wounded and prepared them for evacuation, refusing evacuation even though the NVA heavily outnumbered the American troops.|$|E
25|$|Three holes {{were made}} in the {{perimeter}} wall and oil warehouses were blazing in the southeastern sector. Eight minutes later, Lieutenant Wilhelm Henningsen's crack marines storm unit from the Schleswig-Holstein advanced in three platoons while the Wehrmacht's Pioneers blew up the railroad gate going on the land-bridge, expecting an easy victory over the surprised Poles. Staff Sergeant Wojciech Najsarek, a Polish soldier, was killed by machine-gun fire, the first combat death of both the battle and war. However, soon after crossing the artillery-breached brick wall, the attackers suddenly came into a well-prepared ambush. German soldiers found themselves caught in a <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> of Polish crossfire from concealed firing points (the Germans believed they were also fired on by snipers hidden in the trees, but in reality that was not the case), while barbed wire entanglements effectively blocked quick movements. The Poles knocked out a machine gun nest at the German Schupo and Lt. Leon Pająk opened intense howitzer fire on the advancing Germans, who faltered and stopped their attack. The single 76.2mm field gun knocked out machine-gun nests on top of the warehouses across the harbour canal, but was destroyed by the ship's guns after firing 28 shots.|$|E
2500|$|Hester's {{military}} police squad consisting of eight men {{and two women}} in three Humvees were shadowing a 30-truck supply convoy when approximately 50 insurgent fighters ambushed the convoy with AK-47, RPK machine gun fire, and rocket propelled grenades (RPG). The squad moved {{to the side of}} the road, flanking the insurgents and cutting off their escape route. Hester maneuvered her fire team through the <b>kill</b> <b>zone</b> and into a flanking position, where her squad leader, Staff Sergeant Timothy F. Nein, and she assaulted a trench line with hand grenades and M203 grenade launcher rounds. Nein and Hester assaulted and cleared two trenches. [...] During the 25-minute firefight, Hester killed 3 insurgents.|$|E
50|$|In {{military}} science, minefields {{are considered}} a defensive or harassing weapon, used to slow the enemy down, to help deny certain terrain to the enemy, to focus enemy movement into <b>kill</b> <b>zones,</b> or to reduce morale by randomly attacking material and personnel. In some engagements during World War II, anti-tank mines accounted for half of all vehicles disabled.|$|R
5000|$|One {{unit that}} often {{fell victim to}} such attacks was the 8th Transportation Group, based in Qui Nhon. Two {{dangerous}} stretches of Route 19 between Qui Nhon and Pleiku became the enemy's favorite <b>kill</b> <b>zones,</b> the [...] "Devil's Hairpin" [...] in An Khe Pass and [...] "Ambush Alley" [...] below Mang Giang Pass as incidents occurred there on an almost daily basis.|$|R
50|$|On April 5, 2004, {{the radical}} young cleric Muqtadā al-Ṣadr {{called for a}} jihad against {{coalition}} forces and beginning on Thursday night, April 8, his Mahdi Militia dropped eight bridges and overpasses around the Convoy Support Center Scania, thus severing the supply line from the south, and then began large scale ambushes. Up until that night, the ambushes involved no more than seven ambushers with <b>kill</b> <b>zones</b> no larger than 100 meters. The next day the Militia ambushed any convoy heading into or out of Baghdad International Airport with <b>kill</b> <b>zones</b> several hundred meters long. The worst ambush killed eight KBR drivers and three US Army drivers of the 724th Transportation Company. Matt Maupin was listed as the only American soldier missing in action for several years until his body was finally discovered. After that, Brigadier General James Chambers, Commander of the 13th Corps Support Command, standardized the ratio of gun trucks per convoy and convoys should not exceed 30 vehicles.|$|R
