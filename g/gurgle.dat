500|$|Martin Tsai of the Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} the [...] "cautionary tale {{could not be more}} relevant." [...] Stephanie Merry of The Washington Post wrote that despite the terrible finale, the [...] "movie never feels as {{powerful}} as it should." [...] She felt that the dialogue, acting and music tended to be melodramatic but [...] "the overt heartstring-pulling doesn’t add much." [...] In his review for The Hollywood Reporter, Frank Scheck praised Sheen's portrayal of Anderson and the visuals of the leakage but felt that the film is [...] "slack in its tension". Writing for The New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg noted that the film [...] "mines every chemical drip and <b>gurgle</b> for suspense." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Do Somethin'" [...] is a dance-pop {{song with}} usage of {{electric}} guitars and a [...] "bump beat", {{as described by}} Spence D. of IGN. He also noted the song is [...] "filled with faux string bursts and mock-'70s synth <b>gurgle</b> (think Zapp/Gap Band era) and plenty of treated guitar and bass". According to the sheetmusic published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, it is set at a moderately fast tempo with 130 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of E minor, and Spears' vocal range spans from the low note of E3 to the high note of C6. Lyrically, [...] "Do Somethin'" [...] refers to having fun while being watched by other people, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "Somebody pass my guitar/So I can look like a star." [...] Tim Lee of musicOMH compared the song's style to Gwen Stefani's [...] "What You Waiting For?" [...] (2004).|$|E

2500|$|When a user flushes a toilet, a [...] "toilet flapper valve" [...] (not to be {{confused}} with a type of check valve) opens and allows water from a reservoir tank to quickly enter the toilet bowl. This rapid influx from the tank causes the swirling water in the bowl to rapidly rise and fill the U-shaped inverted siphon tube mounted {{in the back of the}} toilet. This full siphon tube starts the toilet's siphonic action. The siphon action quickly (4–7 seconds) “pulls” nearly all of the water and waste in the bowl and the on-rushing tank water down the drain—it flushes. When most of the water has drained out of the bowl, the continuous column of water up and over the bottom of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe (the siphon) is broken when air enters the siphon tube. The toilet then gives its characteristic <b>gurgle</b> as the siphonic action ceases and no more water flows out of the toilet. After flushing, the flapper valve in the water tank closes; water lines and valves connected to the water supply refill the toilet tank and bowl. Then the toilet is again ready for use.|$|E

2500|$|The song {{received}} {{positive reaction}} from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it [...] "a thumping track which sounds funkier, denser, sexier with each spin". Jim Farber of The New York Daily News gave the song a positive review, stating {{that it is}} [...] "everything a single should be. Pithy, simple and maddeningly catchy, it's her most instantly embraceable single since 'Holiday.'" [...] Farber {{goes on to say}} that it is the song's chorus that [...] "kills," [...] and the [...] "power of dance music" [...] theme of the song is used to comment on current trends. In a review of the album, Vibe called the track [...] "a bouncing parade of synthesizers that pose the question 'Do fortysomething baby-mamas still have the divine right to get down?' (The answer is yes). And so, as the vocoders <b>gurgle</b> and the analog synths invoke Zapp, a slowly building crescendo of rhythm announces Madonna's return." [...] Entertainment Weekly said [...] "the song recaptures the simple perfection of [...] "Holiday" [...] (1982) and brings her career full circle." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine praised the song in a review of the album: [...] " [...] is a retro hands-in-the-air club song reminiscent of Debbie Deb's 'When I Hear Music' and Madonna's own 'Into The Groove'", and called the singer's best dance track since [...] "Vogue", [...] "She sings 'Music makes the people come together' like a track off of her debut album, and as an added bonus she uses words like [...] "bourgeoisie" [...] and [...] "acid-rock" [...] with equal abandon", he completed.|$|E
