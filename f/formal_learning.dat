5|$|William Stanley {{was born}} on Monday 2 February 1829 in Islington, London, one of nine {{children}} of John Stanley (a mechanic and builder) and his wife, Selina Hickman, and a direct descendant of Thomas Stanley, the 17th-century author of History of Philosophy. He was baptised on Wednesday 4 March 1829 at St Mary’s Church, Islington. At the age of 10 Stanley started going regularly to a day school run by a Mr Peil until he was 12. From the age of 12 until he was 14, his maternal uncle William Ford Hickman paid for his education at a different school. Despite having limited <b>formal</b> <b>learning,</b> Stanley taught himself mathematics, mechanics, astronomy, music, French, geology, chemistry, architecture and theology. He attended lessons in technical drawing at the London Mechanics’ Institution (now called Birkbeck College), where he enrolled in 1843, attending engineering and phrenology lessons.|$|E

25|$|Waldorf pedagogues {{consider}} that readiness for <b>formal</b> <b>learning</b> depends upon increased independence of character, temperament, habits, and memory, {{one of the}} markers {{of which is the}} loss of the baby teeth. Formal instruction in reading, writing, and other academic disciplines are therefore not introduced until students enter the elementary school, when pupils are around seven years of age. Steiner believed that engaging young children in abstract intellectual activity too early would adversely affect their growth and development.|$|E
25|$|Higher education, {{post-secondary}} education, {{or third}} level education is an optional {{final stage of}} <b>formal</b> <b>learning</b> that occurs after completion of secondary education. Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, conservatories, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Tertiary education at non-degree level is {{sometimes referred to as}} further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education.|$|E

There are over 16,000 {{schools in the country}} and roughly 9 million students. Of this, about 60% are males and 40% females. Over 174,000 students are enrolled in different universities around the country. About 21% of these are females. Former Education Minister Ghulam Farooq Wardak had stated that construction of 8,000 schools is required for the remaining children who are deprived of <b>formal</b> <b>learning.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} tools and {{strategies}} {{to integrate the}} strengths of <b>formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> in the corporate context via the use of work-based activities within courses. The following proposition is argued: An effective course in the corporate context becomes a blend of <b>formal</b> and informal <b>learning,</b> a guided opportunity to learn from and share experiences gained through work-based activities, and to contribute one’s own experiences as learning resources for others, for use in both <b>formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> settings. Examples from practice in a multinational corporate learning context where a number of courses have been redesigned to allow integration of <b>formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> are given.

25|$|Surgery was {{formally}} taught in Italy {{even though it}} was initially looked down upon as a lower form of medicine. The most important figure of the <b>formal</b> <b>learning</b> of surgery was Guy de Chauliac. He insisted that a proper surgeon should have a specific knowledge of the human body such as anatomy, food and diet of the patient, and other ailments that may have affected the patients. Not only should surgeons have knowledge about the body but they should also be well versed in the liberal arts. In this way, surgery was no longer regarded as a lower practice, but instead began to be respected and gain esteem and status.|$|E
25|$|Italy {{also became}} a seat of great <b>formal</b> <b>learning</b> in 1088 with the {{establishment}} of the University of Bologna, the first university in the Western World. Many other Italian universities soon followed. For example, the Schola Medica Salernitana, in southern Italy, was the first medical school in Europe. These great centres of learning presaged the Rinascimento: the European Renaissance began in Italy and was fueled throughout Europe by Italian painters, sculptors, architects, scientists, literature masters and music composers. Italy continued its leading cultural role through the Baroque period and into the Romantic period, when its dominance in painting and sculpture diminished but the Italians re-established a strong presence in music.|$|E
25|$|Collective {{intelligence}} strongly {{contributes to}} the shift of knowledge and power from the individual to the collective. According to Eric S. Raymond (1998) and JC Herz (2005), open source intelligence will eventually generate superior outcomes to knowledge generated by proprietary software developed within corporations (Flew 2008). Media theorist Henry Jenkins sees collective intelligence as an 'alternative source of media power', related to convergence culture. He draws attention to education and the way people are learning to participate in knowledge cultures outside <b>formal</b> <b>learning</b> settings. Henry Jenkins criticizes schools which promote 'autonomous problem solvers and self-contained learners' while remaining hostile to learning through the means of collective intelligence. Both Pierre Lévy (2007) and Henry Jenkins (2008) support the claim that collective intelligence is important for democratization, as it is interlinked with knowledge-based culture and sustained by collective idea sharing, and thus contributes {{to a better understanding}} of diverse society.|$|E

Phoebe, seeing that her son's mind was not well adapted to <b>formal</b> <b>learning,</b> allowed him to earn money through odd jobs. He obtained work as printer's devil at the Indianapolis Journal, where his duties involved delivering the newspaper to subscribers, among them local pastor Henry Ward Beecher. In 1845, Phoebe's father, a Cincinnati merchant, gave his daughter $1,000, enough to buy the family a farm. As both Jacob and Ezra Meeker realized the boy enjoyed the outdoor life more than inside work, Jacob placed Ezra in charge of the farm, allowing the elder Meeker to work as a miller.|$|E

2500|$|Educators {{and advocates}} of new digital literacies are {{confident}} that social networking encourages the development of transferable, technical, and social skills of value in formal and informal learning. In a <b>formal</b> <b>learning</b> environment, goals or objectives are determined by an outside department or agency. Tweeting, instant messaging, or blogging enhances student involvement. Students who would not normally participate in class {{are more apt to}} partake through social network services. Networking allows participants the opportunity for just-in-time learning and higher levels of engagement. The use of SNSs allow educators to enhance the prescribed curriculum. When learning experiences are infused into a website students utilize everyday for fun, students realize that learning can and should be a part of everyday life.

It includes (a) making preinstructional decisions about tasks, objectives, group size and composition, roles, materials and room assignment (b) explaining {{the task and}} cooperative structure to the students (c) monitoring students' learning and intervening to provide assistance in completing the task or using group skills effectively and (d) assessing students' learning and helping students process how well their groups functioned.|$|R

25|$|Paine was not, on the whole, expressing {{original}} {{ideas in}} Common Sense, but rather employing rhetoric {{as a means}} to arouse resentment of the Crown. To achieve these ends, he pioneered a style of political writing suited to the democratic society he envisioned, with Common Sense serving as a primary example. Part of Paine's work was to render complex ideas intelligible to average readers of the day, with clear, concise writing unlike the <b>formal,</b> <b>learned</b> style favored by many of Paine's contemporaries. Scholars have put forward various explanations to account for its success, including the historic moment, Paine's easy-to-understand style, his democratic ethos, and his use of psychology and ideology.|$|R

40|$|Purpose - To date, little {{attention}} has been given to the circumstances in which the process of developing key competencies for sustainable development may take place. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to consider, the possibilities both of <b>formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> and their relationship to competence development within higher education. Design/methodology/approach - An explorative, qualitative study based on focus groups was designed using different groups from <b>formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> settings. Findings - The development of key competencies is based both on cognitive and non-cognitive dispositions and asks for multiple contexts. Through combining <b>formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> settings within higher education - as part of a new learning culture - a variety of contexts can be given and competence development can be enhanced. Research limitations/implications - While aspects of both <b>formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> settings could be identified, the interdependencies between them remain elusive. Practical implications - Based on the findings, some main aspects for acquiring competencies can be pointed out that may be crucial in higher education settings. Originality/value - The paper analyses the implications for both <b>formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> settings of new ways of developing key competencies within higher education.

40|$|Learning is {{a process}} that takes place in our brain, in {{response}} to our experiences in <b>formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> environments. Both of these environments have their distinctive characteristics which instigate learning process and research has also established that learning process is mediated by external and internal factors; and one such factor is learning motivation. This paper investigates learning motivation factors within <b>formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> environments, processes and their influence upon Web-based learning (WBL), because WBL can occur in both <b>formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> environments. To achieve this, we have discussed relevant literature on <b>formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> environments, processes and motivational theories which have helped us to develop our research model for hypotheses testing. This research study is conducted through a survey based questionnaire, scales of which were developed on the basis of Keller’s ARCS Model, Moshinskie’s Motivation Model and Malone & Lepper’s Motivation Theory. 350 copies of the questionnaire were distributed to students at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS. The data obtained from the survey was statistically analyzed and descriptive analysis including mean and standard deviation, reliability analysis and Pearson correlation were computed. Results showed that motivational factors associated with <b>formal</b> and informal <b>learning</b> environments and processes have strong influence upon web-based learning environments...|$|R
