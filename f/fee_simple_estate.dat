40|$|This study focuses upon {{contact between}} British-Canadian, Aboriginal and Mennonite colonists' systems of property. Both Aboriginal peoples and Mennonites sought to {{maintain}} within the British-Canadian state their own areas of civil jurisdiction, including distinct property systems. They gained de facto civil autonomy at first, {{but eventually the}} British-Canadian state presumed to define their property rights according to British-Canadian law. Aboriginal peoples' property rights, secured by promises from the Crown, gradually were incorporated into the British-Canadian property system as usufructuary interests which could be converted into <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>estates</b> only {{at the discretion of}} the Crown. Mennonite property rights, derived from Crown grants, immediately were incorporated into the British-Canadian property system as <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>estates</b> which were enforceable against all parties including the Crown. The systematic enforcement of British (later Canadian) property rights, against competing Aboriginal property rights, ultimately led, by 1848, to the dislocation in Upper Canada (today's Ontario) of the Six Nations from the Grand River Valley; and in what is now southern Manitoba, to the dislocation of Métis people from the Red River Valley by 1878. 	The provincial governors/lieutenant-governors ensured that Aboriginal peoples' dislocation occurred without resort to the degree of bloody armed conflict that characterized Aboriginal-newcomer relations in the American Northwest. So long as the Six Nations in Upper Canada and the Métis people in Red River/Manitoba held the balance of military power, provincial gave governors/lieutenant-governors recognized Aboriginal property rights secured by prior agreements. The Six Nations and Métis people consequently exercised their military power consistently in favour of the Crown because they believed that their interests could best be promoted by enforcing prior agreements through this channel. Thus, at every flashpoint in the periods under investigation [...] whenever they might have united with newcomers in opposing imperial/dominion control of the administration of "Crown" lands [...] the Six Nations and Métis people forestalled such action and prevented an American-style revolution from taking place in Canada...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} a [...] "fee" [...] has its origins in feudalism. William Blackstone defined <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> as the <b>estate</b> in land that a person has when the lands are given {{to him and his}} heirs absolutely, without any end or limit put to his estate. Land held in <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> can be {{conveyed}} to whomsoever its owner pleases; it can also be mortgaged or put up as security.Owners of real property in <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> have the privilege of interest in the property during their lifetime and typically have a say in determining who gets to own an interest in the property after their death.|$|R
5000|$|Common land (a common), in England and Wales and the United States, is a {{piece of}} land owned by one person, but over which other people can {{exercise}} certain traditional rights, such as allowing their livestock to graze upon it. If the owner of the common right becomes the owner of the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>estate,</b> then the common right becomes extinguished. If the crop or other item over which there is a common right is severed from the land, then the common right becomes extinguished. Other situations in which the common right becomes extinguished include legal release and approvement (improvement of common lands, by inclosing and converting them to the uses of husbandry for the advantage of the lord of the manor.) ...|$|E
5000|$|If {{previous}} grantors of a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>estate</b> do {{not create}} any conditions for subsequent grantees, then {{the title is}} called fee simple absolute. A fee simple absolute is the highest estate permitted by law and it gives the holder full possessory rights and obligations {{now and in the}} future. Other fee simple estates in real property include fee simple defeasible (or fee simple determinable) estates. A defeasible estate is created when a grantor places a condition on a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>estate</b> (in the deed). When a specified event happens, the estate may become void or subject to annulment. There are two types of defeasible estates: fee simple determinable and the fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. If the grantor uses durational language in the condition such as [...] "to A. as long as the land is used for a park", then upon the happening of the specified event (in this case if the land is used for anything other than a park), the estate will automatically terminate and revert to the grantor or the grantor's estate; this is called a fee simple determinable. If the grantor uses language such as [...] "but if alcohol is served", then the grantor or the heirs have a right of entry if the condition occurs, but the estate does not automatically revert to the grantor; this is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. In most jurisdictions in the United States these concepts have been modified by statute. Fee simple determinable was generally preferred by courts in the common law of the early United States. Recently, that trend has reversed, and most courts in the United States will find a fee simple subject to condition subsequent in situations where the conveying document's language is unclear.|$|E
50|$|In Anglo-Saxon England, when {{interest}} {{loans were}} illegal, the main method of securing realty was by wadset (ME wedset). A wadset was a loan masked as a {{sale of land}} under right of reversion. The borrower (reverser) conveyed by charter a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>estate,</b> in consideration of a loan, to the lender (wadsetter) who on redemption would reconvey the estate to the reverser by a second charter. The difficulty with this arrangement was that the wadsetter was absolute owner of the property and could sell it to a third party or refuse to reconvey it to the reverser, who was also stripped of his principal means of repayment and therefore in a weak position. In later years the practice—especially in Scotland and on the continent—was to execute together the wadset and a separate back-bond according the reverser an in personam right of reverter.|$|E

Because {{of the lack of}} resale data available for many of the emerging markets where pre-construction condo hotels can be found, experts heed caution when considering a condo hotel purchase for investment purposes alone.

50|$|A {{real estate}} {{contract}} is a contract between parties {{for the purchase}} and sale, exchange, or other conveyance of real estate. The sale of land is governed by the laws and practices of the jurisdiction in which the land is located. Real estate called leasehold estate is actually a rental of real property such as an apartment, and leases (rental contracts) cover such rentals since they typically do not result in recordable deeds. Freehold ("More permanent") conveyances of real estate are covered by real estate contracts, including conveying <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> title, life <b>estates,</b> remainder estates, and freehold easements. Real estate contracts are typically bilateral contracts (i. e., agreed to by two parties) and should have the legal requirements specified by contract law in general and should also be in writing to be enforceable.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, a {{life estate}} is {{typically}} {{used as a}} tool of an estate planning. A life estate can avoid probate and ensure that an intended heir will receive title to real property. For example, Al owns a home and desires that Bill inherit it after Al's death. Al can effectuate that desire by transferring title to the home to Bill and retaining a life estate in the home. Al keeps a life estate and Bill receives a vested <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> remainder. As soon as Al dies, the life estate interest merges with Bill's remainder, and Bill has a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> title. Such a transfer risks the small risk of a fraud on the part of beneficiary Bill if he could easily show in a particular jurisdiction an unfettered <b>fee</b> <b>simple,</b> selling the <b>estate</b> prematurely to an innocent purchaser such as when Al is on vacation but makes the use of a will unnecessary and eliminates the need to probate the asset. A second disadvantage to the grantor is that provision for any remainderman (or men) (party C) is irrevocable without the remainderman's consent. [...] "Beneficiary deeds" [...] have been statutorily created in some states to address this issue.|$|R
5000|$|In English common law, the Crown has radical title or the {{allodium}} of all land in England, {{meaning that}} it is the ultimate [...] "owner" [...] of all land. However, the Crown can grant ownership in an abstract entity—called an estate in land—which is what is owned rather than the land it represents. The <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>estate</b> is also called [...] "estate in fee simple" [...] or [...] "fee-simple title", sometimes simply [...] "freehold" [...] in England and Wales. From the start of the Norman period, when feudalism was introduced to England, the tenant or [...] "holder" [...] of a fief could not alienate (sell) it from the possession of his overlord. However, a tenant could separate a parcel of the land and grant it as a subordinate fief to his own sub-tenant, a process known as sub-enfeoffing or [...] "subinfeudation". The 1290 Statute of Quia Emptores abolished subinfeudation and instead allowed the sale of fee simple estates.|$|E
50|$|The {{solution}} was to merge the latter-day wadset and gage for years into a single transaction embodied in two instruments: (1) the absolute conveyance (the charter) in fee or for years to the lender; (2) an indenture or bond (the defeasance) reciting the loan and providing {{that if it was}} repaid the land would reinvest in the borrower, but if not the lender would retain title. If repaid on time, the lender would reinvest title using a reconveyance deed. This was the mortgage by conveyance (aka mortgage in fee) or, when written, the mortgage by charter and reconveyance and took the form of a feoffment, bargain and sale, or lease and release. Since the lender did not necessarily enter into possession, had rights of action, and covenanted a right of reversion on the borrower, the mortgage was a proper collateral security. Thus, a mortgage was on its face an absolute conveyance of a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>estate,</b> but was in fact conditional, and would be of no effect if certain conditions were met.|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} characteristic of real property law, {{one that is}} definitional in nature, is that its subject matter consists of land parcels. A land parcel, in contrast to an ownership interest such as a <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>estate,</b> is not an abstraction. Each land parcel has a physical reality, and virtually all land parcels abut other parcels. Each parcel has one particular location, defined by its proximity to other pieces of property. The value of a land parcel depends heavily upon its location, {{and the nature of}} neighboring parcels has a major impact in determining that value. Owners of neighboring parcels have sets of rights, privileges, and duties that define their legal relationships with neighbors. In Anglo-American law, those rights, privileges, and duties are components of real property law, but they are not a recognized category of real property law. Rather, they represent the application of general doctrines and rules to neighbors, instead of a distinct and cohesive body of law of its own. Other legal systems have developed distinct bodies of law to govern relations among neighbors. The law of neighbors or “neighborhood law” is not presently a recognized type of law practice in the United States, and it will not likely become one anytime in the near future. In part this is the case because neighbor law disputes typically do not involve high financial stakes and resulting incentives for lawyers to market themselves as experts in the area. This Article suggests that if the field of neighbor law develops in the United States, academics will have to lead the way. This Article does three things. First, it introduces the “stranger model” and the “friend model” of neighbors law, using these models as a frame for describing three components of existing U. S. law applicable to neighboring landowners. Second, it briefly describes the extent to which South Africa and Scotland have come to describe neighbors law as a discrete legal category, which correlates to the stranger model and friend model. Third, it concludes by making several suggestions on how the models may help in the construction of a coherent law of neighbors...|$|E

40|$|The High Court {{passed up}} the {{opportunity}} to clarify important issues in its judgement on the NT Intervention, writes Tessa Meyrick  in High Court Watch, the second {{in a series of}} reports on significant policy-related cases   IN FEBRUARY of this year, the High Court dismissed a constitutional challenge to the federal intervention into Northern Territory Aboriginal communities. The Intervention was launched by the Howard government in 2007 in a bid to tackle child sexual abuse within certain remote indigenous communities, along with alcohol and drug abuse, pornography and gambling. Relying on section 122 of the Constitution, which empowers the federal parliament to make laws for the Territories, the government introduced a package of legislation aimed at, among other things, improving living conditions and reducing overcrowding by taking control of a number of Aboriginal townships. Two key bills were passed allowing for these changes {{to be made in the}} shortest possible time frame: the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Bill 2007 (NER), which creates five-year leases in favour of the Commonwealth over specific areas of Aboriginal land; and, the Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2007 (FaCSIA), which removes the prohibition against entry (without prior permission) onto Aboriginal land insofar as the main townships and the road corridors between them are concerned (referred to as the “permit system”). Both pieces of legislation provide for compensation only if the Act results in something that can be categorised in constitutional terms as an “acquisition of property. ” If, according to this criterion, compensation is required, it will be determined either by agreement between the parties or, failing that, by court order. Reggie Wurridjal and Joy Garlbin, traditional owners of the Maningrida land in Arnhem Land, joined with the Bawinanga Aboriginal Corporation to claim that the five-year lease created over their land as part of the emergency intervention constituted an “acquisition” under section 51 (xxxi) of the Constitution. Compulsory acquisitions of property made by the Commonwealth are constitutionally required to be on “just terms. ” According to the plaintiffs, this requirement was not satisfied by the compensation schemes laid out in the challenged legislation and the five-year lease was therefore invalid. In response to this claim, the Commonwealth lodged a demurrer – a special pleading asking the Court to pre-emptively dismiss the case on the grounds that the facts alleged by the plaintiffs do not show any legal cause of action. In a 6 - 1 majority, the High Court accepted the demurrer – denying the plaintiffs a right to present their challenge in a trial – and ordered the plaintiffs to pay the Commonwealth’s court costs. The Court overrules Teori Tau The Commonwealth’s first argument was that because the challenged legislation was enacted as a function of its power to make laws for the Territories, which is expressed broadly and separately from all other federal powers in the Constitution, it was therefore unconstrained by the “just terms” requirement in s 51 (xxxi). All members of the High Court who directly addressed the issue rejected this submission and, in doing so, overturned the case of Teori Tau v Commonwealth (1969) 119 CLR 564, decided forty years ago, but rarely relied upon since. In Teori Tau, the Court held that the Territories power is general and unqualified and not concerned (as section 51 is) with defining federal legislative powers as part of the distribution of legislative power between the Commonwealth and the States. According to the Court, this distinction meant that s 122 was not limited or qualified by s 51 (xxxi), or any other provision in that paragraph. Such a view is commonly referred to as the “disparate power” theory of s 122, since in practice it treats parliament’s power over the Territories as being unconnected to its role as a national law-making body and denies to Territorians some constitutional protections available to other Australians. The disparate power theory has steadily fallen out of judicial favour over the last 40 years and, in Wurridjal, was dealt another blow. Forming the most constitutionally significant aspect of the decision, the High Court preferred to see the Territories power as but one of a range of federal powers given to the national legislature. Interpreting the Constitution as a single, coherent document mandates the view that, situated in a Territory or not, no person “can be subjected to a law of the Commonwealth acquiring the property of that person other than on just terms. ” Are the five-year leases actually “acquisitions of property”? Answering the plaintiffs’ claim head-on, the Commonwealth submitted that either no acquisition of property had taken place or that what had been acquired was not “property” or “property capable of being acquired” within the meaning in s 51 (xxxi). And, even if there had been a relevant acquisition of property, the compensation schemes in the Acts amount to “just terms” in any case. The plaintiffs identified two sets of property interests as having been acquired by the Commonwealth as part of the intervention: the <b>fee</b> <b>simple</b> <b>estate</b> in the Maningrida land, originally granted under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (Cth); and the right they held thanks to s 71 of the same Act, which entitled them, as traditional Aboriginal owners, to enter upon and use or occupy the Maningrida land in accordance with Aboriginal tradition. In dealing with these issues, there were several points that most, if not all, members of the Court agreed upon. With the exception of Justice Crennan (and perhaps Justice Heydon), each accepted, at the very least, that the creation of the five-year lease under the NER Act constituted an “acquisition” to which the “just terms” requirement applied. The case failed, however, because the majority of the Court (with Justice Kirby in dissent) held that the compensation schemes were enough to satisfy this requirement. In separate judgments, Chief Justice French, Justices Gummow and Hayne, and Justice Kirby agreed that the fact that the plaintiffs’ freehold interest was granted by statute – and that this statute specifically allows for adjustments to be made in the balance of control over land between the Commonwealth and the Land Trust – does not, by itself, preclude such adjustments from constituting an “acquisition. ” The same Justices also stressed that the fact that an acquisition was made for a regulatory or public purpose was irrelevant to whether it was an “acquisition” of the type contemplated by s 51 (xxxi). On both these points, Justice Crennan disagreed. According to Her Honour, the Land Rights Act was always susceptible to “adjustments” of the kind effected by the challenged legislation. These adjustments are entirely acceptable if they are necessary and directed to achieve the purpose of the Land Rights Act in the first place: namely, “supporting the traditional Aboriginal owners. ” Since the NER Act and the FaCSIA Act are aimed at “achieving conditions in which the current generation of traditional Aboriginal owners of the land can live and thrive,” and are not directed to “benefiting the Commonwealth” as such, in Justice Crennan’s view they fall outside the scope of s 51 (xxxi). Justice Crennan’s argument that s 52 (xxxi) will not protect property rights if the legislative change effecting the acquisition is one contemplated by the original statute is not, in itself, legally untenable. There are several steps in Her Honour’s subsequent reasoning, however, that may be on less safe footing. For example, construing the purpose of the Land Rights Act in these somewhat rudimentary terms risks underplaying an important distinction between it and the NER Act.   While both Acts are ostensibly aimed at “benefitting” Aboriginal peoples, each takes a very different approach to achieving this end. The Second Reading Speech for the Land Rights Act makes clear that that legislation is aimed at benefiting traditional owners in a way that allows for (and is predicated upon the importance of) the idea of self-determination: "The Australia we, as a Government, look to is one in which there is diversity and choice, because it is in diversity that people can pursue the lives they want in ways that they determine. Securing land rights to Aborigines in the Northern Territory is a significant expression of this objective…" Such an approach is vastly and importantly different from the approach of the NER Act, under which “benefit” is conferred by suspending some of the very rights the Land Rights Act put in place so that the Commonwealth can move swiftly to implement its policies. Further problems are encountered when we consider the difficulties laden in the concept of “benefit” itself. At points, Her Honour seems to uncritically accept the Howard Government’s rationale for launching the Intervention, without considering that the nature of the “benefit” conferred by each Act might be qualitatively different. For the other Justices in the majority, such a distinction is likely to be of no legal significance; but, if we are invited to contemplate the policy behind the challenged legislation as a factor in determining whether s 51 (xxxi) applies to it, it seems prudent to at least acknowledge that the concept of “benefit” will mean different things to different people. The plaintiffs also argued that the partial abolition of the “permit system” under the FaCSIA Act deprived the Land Trust of its entitlement to exclusive possession and enjoyment of the common areas of Maningrida land, and in this sense similarly offended s 51 (xxxi). A majority of the court agreed that if (as some of them affirmed) narrowing the prohibition against entry onto Aboriginal land did amount to an acquisition of property, no additional acquisition had taken place, since the plaintiffs’ had already been deprived of their right to exclusive possession by the creation of the 5 -year lease. Getting to the real issue: access to spiritual sites Freehold titles over land (the type of title held by the plaintiffs in this case) have always been treated as the strongest form of property right and the High Court has confirmed elsewhere that, whatever their special characteristics, Aboriginal freeholds are no exception. On this basis, the fact that the Court (apart from Justice Crennan) found the challenged legislation to have effected an acquisition of property is perhaps unremarkable. Ultimately, it adds very little to our understanding of the meaning of the term “property” or of the full scope of protection offered by s 51 (xxxi). But, what of proprietary interests that are less conventional? Separate from their freehold interest in the land, the plaintiffs are entitled (under s 71 of the Land Rights Act) to enter upon, use or occupy the Maningrida land in accordance with Aboriginal tradition, which includes the use and occupation of four sacred sites.   Arguing that these rights were “property” within the meaning of s 51 (xxxi), the plaintiffs raised the concern that they too had been compulsorily acquired because the Commonwealth (as lease-holder) now had a right to possession and quiet enjoyment to the exclusion of the traditional owners. There is a provision in the NER Act that preserves a range of rights, entitlements and interests existing immediately before the creation of the lease, but the plaintiffs worried about another provision in the Act that empowered the Minister to terminate these rights at will. This concern could have led to an inquiry that helped clarify the proper ambit of s 51 (xxxi), but it was somewhat disappointingly side-stepped by the Court. All members of the majority determined that the s 71 entitlements, having existed before the lease was created, would be preserved by s 34 of the NER Act. A majority also found that the Minister’s power to terminate pre-existing interests was not expressed plainly enough to include a power to extinguish the right to enter, use and occupy land in accordance with Aboriginal tradition. The Court’s findings with respect the s 71 rights are not, on the whole, bad for the plaintiffs. Indeed, the plaintiffs themselves evinced a preference for the same interpretation, since arguing the contrary would be asking the Court to declare with finality that their right to access the sacred sites was vulnerable to the will of the Minister. Still, it is hard to escape the feeling that the plaintiffs’ openness to a reading of the legislation more favourable to their traditional rights was something of a of a double-edged sword. By interpreting the NER Act in this way, the Court was able to avoid answering the inevitable constitutional question of whether access to sacred sites constituted “property” within the meaning of s 51 (xxxi) and whether it would therefore be protected by the “just terms” requirement. In so doing, the Court was also able to avoid the related question of whether Aboriginal rights and interests in land could ever be replaced or readily compensated for by the payment of money. It is by no means uncommon for the Court to refrain from answering legal questions when it is not necessary for the resolution of the case to do so; usually, expediency demands it. But expediency in this case arguably required the Court to look beyond the formal pleadings made by the plaintiffs to where the real issues and legal controversies lay. Justice cannot be served if the plaintiffs must argue a point that is fundamentally detrimental to their interests in order to have a serious and novel point of law explored. This is especially so given the Commonwealth’s use of the demurrer process, which provides very little space to properly ventilate the underlying legal issues. Ultimately, it may be that the set of facts behind this case were simply not well suited to the critical task of testing the scope of the “just terms” protection as it applies to the full spectrum of Aboriginal property rights.   It may also be that the plaintiffs did a poor job of framing their submissions in a way that made it easy for the High Court to deal with this question. But these are problems that may have been remedied or at least given closer scrutiny at the trial stage. As Justice Kirby, in dissent, points out: “[T]his is not an occasion to provide peremptory legal relief to the Commonwealth, by way of demurrer. Certainly it is not so where the claimants might establish arguable legal entitlements by refining and repleading their cause; by presenting their evidence to make their claims clearer and more concrete by testing governmental objections at trial; and by elaborating the applicable law when addressing novel aspects of their claim. ” The troubling point with this case, then, is not that the points of law actually dealt with were decided erroneously, but that in leaving certain points of law undecided the High Court missed an opportunity to conduct a meaningful exploration of the Aboriginal rights affected by the five-year lease and the just terms appropriate to meet such loss. All members of the Court were at pains to point out that their judgments were not made on the merits of the policy underpinning the Intervention, but on its legality only. It may be unfair to suggest, therefore, that the view taken by the majority was unfavourably influenced by the plaintiffs’ Aboriginality in this instance. It is legitimate, however, to observe that the strictly positivist approach the current High Court takes to the law has a tendency to miss the spirit of the enquiry put to it and that, in some cases and for some plaintiffs, this can have serious implications for its capacity to serve the interests of justice. The question of whether the right to access sacred sites might afford the protection of s 51 (xxxi) – and the attendant issue of the general compensability of Aboriginal land interests – was clearly raised in this case, and it is not unreasonable to be frustrated by the Court’s refusal to deal with it. • Tessa Meyrick is researcher with the Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law at the University of New South Wales Photo: Linda & Colin McKie/ iStockphoto. co...|$|E
40|$|Real {{property}} {{can only}} be held and conveyed in {{a small number of}} forms, such as <b>fee</b> <b>simple,</b> life <b>estate,</b> and lease. This principle is known as numerus clausus, meaning “the number is closed. ” For centuries, the principle has been central to the common-law system of property rights. Scholars have justified it as a mechanism for facilitating effective property alienation, maintaining low transaction costs in the buying and selling of property, and keeping the scope of property owners’ rights clear. In contrast, the numerus clausus principle is essentially nonexistent in intellectual property law. In the context of patents and copyrights, “the number is open. ” There is nearly no limit {{to the ways in which}} intellectual objects can be licensed and sold. This Article will argue that the numerus clausus principle should extend to intellectual property. The justifications for the numerus clausus principle in real property law are even more persuasive in the intellectual property context because the scope of intellectual property rights is more difficult to delineate than the scope of real property rights. The metaphysical nature of intellectual property prevents protected objects from being clearly identifiable, particularly in a patent context, where inventions can be independently created by multiple parties. As a result, investigating the sale and licensing history of a work or invention — and whether a work or invention is protected at all — is difficult, costly, and sometimes impossible. This difficulty is compounded by the absence of numerus clausus, which permits inscrutable licensing and sale agreements and allows single works to be carved into several parts and burdened by complicated usage rules. By considering examples of digital content licensing and fragmentation of particular copyrights, this Article will identify how a numerus clausus principle for intellectual property would facilitate the use and conveyance of intellectual property. This principle would benefit intellectual property owners, licensees, and the general public by lowering transaction costs and preventing accidental overuse and underuse of intellectual works...|$|R
