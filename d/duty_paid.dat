5|$|Abir {{collected}} 70 tons {{of dried}} rubber in 1895, rising to 410 tons in 1898 {{by which time}} it had eleven operational posts. At {{the same time the}} price of rubber also increased from 6.30–6.50 fr per kilogram in 1894 to 8.04–10.00 fr per kilogram in 1898. Abir's costs in 1897 amounted to 0.25 fr per kilogram to purchase the rubber from the collectors (in lieu of tax), 0.4 fr for transportation, 0.25 in export <b>duty</b> <b>paid</b> to the Congo Free State and 0.45 for storage for a total cost of 1.35 fr per kilogram. In the same year Abir could sell on the rubber in Europe for up to 10 fr per kilogram. Abir's profits rose with the increasing quantity and price of rubber, for the first two years (1892–94) the company recorded a total profit of 131,340 fr, this had increased almost twentyfold by 1898 when they recorded a 2,482,697 fr profit just for one year. As a result, the dividend paid in 1898 was 1,100 fr per 500 fr share. These profits were made in spite of increasing costs due the doubling of export duty in 1892 and the construction of the Leopoldville-Matadi railway in 1894 which increased the cost of moving rubber to the coast to 0.63 fr per kilo, more than the entire trip to Antwerp had taken in 1892.|$|E

25|$|Excise duty stamps {{to pay the}} tax {{on alcohol}} have been in use since around 2008. Issues to pay the tax on spirits are printed on silver foil, with designs {{similar to those used}} on cigarettes, and they exist inscribed either EXCISE <b>DUTY</b> <b>PAID</b> or MT EXCISE. The excise duty on wine was {{introduced}} in 2015, and the first issue was inscribed EXCISE TAX STAMP and printed on gold foil. Later that year, paper strips and circular labels inscribed MT EXCISE were issued, and they are still in use as of 2017.|$|E

25|$|In 1972–73, smaller designs {{depicting}} the post-independence {{coat of arms}} and denominated in the Maltese lira were issued. This design remained in use from the 1970s to the 1990s, with changes in the coats of arms in 1975 and 1988. A new series with a similar design but with the inscriptions altered to SISA in Maltese and EXCISE in English was introduced in around 1995. Specific types for imported cigarettes were also issued between the 1970s and the 1990s or 2000s. In around 2005, stamps inscribed EXCISE <b>DUTY</b> <b>PAID</b> and printed on silver foil incorporating a security hologram were introduced, and these exist in two designs. In 2017, similar stamps inscribed MT EXCISE were introduced.|$|E
60|$|I would mention those {{articles}} which {{enter into}} manufactures of all sorts. All <b>duty</b> <b>paid</b> upon such articles goes {{directly to the}} cost of the article when manufactured here, and must be paid for by the consumers. These duties not only come from the consumers at home, but act as a protection to foreign manufacturers of the same completed articles in our own and distant markets.|$|E
60|$|The common food of {{the people}} was the chestnut, and to the great {{majority}} of them even the coarsest rye-bread was a luxury that they had never tasted. Maise and buckwheat were their chief cereals, and these, together with a coarse radish, took up hundreds of acres that might under a happier system have produced fine wheat and nourished fruit-trees. There had once been a certain export of cattle, but that had now come to an end, partly because the general decline of the district had impaired the quality of the beasts, and partly because the Parisian butchers, who were by much the greatest customers, had found the markets of Normandy more convenient. The more the trade went down, the heavier was the burden of the cattle-tax on the stock that remained. The stock-dealer was thus ruined from both sides at once. In the same way, the Limousin horses, whose breed had been famous all over France, had ceased to be an object of commerce, and the progressive increase of taxation had gradually extinguished the trade. Angoumois, which formed part of the Generality of Limoges, had previously boasted of producing the best and finest paper in the world, and it had found a market not only throughout France, but all over Europe. There had been a time when this manufacture supported sixty mills; at the death of Lewis XIV. their number had fallen from sixty to sixteen. An excise duty at the mill, a duty on exportation at the provincial frontier, a duty on the importation of rags over the provincial frontier,--all these vexations had succeeded in reducing the trade with Holland, one of France's best customers, to one-fourth of its previous dimensions. Nor were paper and cattle the only branches of trade that had been blighted by fiscal perversity. The same burden arrested the transport of saffron across the borders of the province, on its way to Hungary and Prussia and the other cold lands where saffron was a favourite condiment. Salt which came up the Charente from the marshes by the coast, was stripped of all its profit, first by the <b>duty</b> <b>paid</b> on crossing from the Limousin to Périgord and Auvergne, and next by the right possessed by certain of the great lords {{on the banks of the}} Charente to help themselves at one point and another to portions of the cargo. Iron was subject to a harassing excise in all those parts of the country that were beyond the jurisdiction of the parlement of Bordeaux. The effect of such positive hindrances as these to the transit of goods was further aided, to the destruction of trade, by the absence of roads. There were four roads in the province, but all of them so bad that the traveller knew not whether to curse more lustily the rocks or the swamps that interrupted his journey alternately. There were two rivers, the Vienne and the Vézère, and these might seem to an enthusiast for the famous argument from Design, as if Nature had intended them for the transport of timber from the immense forests that crowned the Limousin hills. Unluckily, their beds were so thickly bestrewn with rock that neither of them was navigable for any considerable part of its long course through the ill-starred province.|$|E
