5|$|<b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> I {{wanted to}} write poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
25|$|In {{mind and}} manner he {{is a strange}} replica of his father, with all his father's suddenness and awareness, and <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say,</b> more than his father's ability.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> the {{defendants}} have {{done just that}} {{for which they are}} indicted. If I might agree to their conviction without creating a precedent, I cheerfully would do so. I can see in their teachings nothing but humbug, untainted by any trace of truth. But that does not dispose of the constitutional question whether misrepresentation of religious experience or belief is prosecutable; it rather emphasizes the danger of such prosecutions.|$|E
60|$|LADY CAROLINE (briefly). As you ask me, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{certainly}} <b>say</b> jail.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> feared--or <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> hoped?--the {{allusion to}} me would make Mr. Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank {{farther into the}} shade: but he never turned his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'They {{are well}} worth reading, indeed <b>I</b> <b>should</b> almost <b>say</b> studying, {{so as to}} mould the {{teaching}} of your young ones upon them.|$|R
25|$|When {{flying the}} four wings are spread quite far apart, fore and hind {{wing of the}} same side far apart, body horizontal. Flight slow enough so that the {{movements}} of each separate wing can be seen—insect consequently moves slowly but can dodge. Mr. Barnes compared {{the movements of the}} wings to that of a windmill, but the revolving movements are lacking; <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> the effect produced by the wings is more like that of a jumping-jack with moveable arms and legs pulled by one string, rather slowly, but, of course, at regular intervals.|$|E
25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
500|$|Epstein {{spent a year}} {{studying}} acting at RADA, but {{dropped out}} shortly after his arrest for [...] "persistent importuning" [...] outside a men's public toilet in Swiss Cottage, London; cottaging, as it was called, {{was one of the}} few public places gay and bisexual men could meet at the time, especially if they were closeted. When Epstein first saw the Beatles perform he noticed their stage attire first, saying, [...] "They were rather scruffily dressed, in the nicest possible way, or <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> in the most attractive way— black leather jackets, jeans, long hair of course." [...] McCartney said that when Epstein started to manage the Beatles they knew that he was homosexual but did not care, because he encouraged them professionally and offered them access to previously off-limits social circles.|$|E
6000|$|Sometimes as an {{authority}} [...] On motor-cars, I'm asked if <b>I</b> [...] <b>Should</b> <b>say</b> our stock was petered out, [...] And {{this is my}} sincere reply: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To be sure, my dear,' he returned, with a most {{flagrant}} {{assumption of}} unconsciousness, 'I did omit it. How--or perhaps <b>I</b> <b>should</b> rather <b>say</b> where--IS Bella?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then <b>I</b> <b>should</b> decidedly <b>say</b> refuse her,' said Mr. Mohun. 'It {{would be}} a warning {{that she could not}} disregard, and the best chance of {{improving}} her.' ...|$|R
500|$|In 1915, the {{children}} of an unknown family living in a Devonshire rectory wrote to express their disappointment in {{the lack of a}} sequel to Mr. Tod. Potter enjoyed continuing the lives of her characters through these letters and responded:It is sad to have caused such disappointment! [...] I think I saw Tommy Brock's wife last week. I couldn't think who the person reminded me of, and when I read your letter I remembered directly! I am not sure how many of a family there are [...] lots! and what we call a [...] "long" [...] family, all ages with some long time between. I believe Tommy Brock is very grumpy with the grown-up ones, and makes them clear off into the woods; and, as you know, he is not often at home himself. Mrs. Badger is rather lighter coloured than he is, rather sandy, with little piggy eyes and a snouty nose, and a not particularly clean house, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> [...] she finishes wearing out Tommy's celebrated boots. Mr. Tod has been across lately, I smelt him myself; but he had removed before the hounds came.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Welch. Yes. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say,</b> Mr. Senator, that a pixie {{is a close}} {{relative}} of a fairy. (Laughter from the chamber) Shall I proceed, sir? Have I enlightened you? ...|$|E
2500|$|Years later, Egerton said [...] "if you {{ask what}} my policy is, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> 'open means of communication' {{and if you}} wish for {{additional}} information, I would reply 'open more of them!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because then <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be <b>saying,</b> 'Good-morning, Angela,' {{instead of}} 'Good-night, Angela,' May I call you Angela? We {{seem to know}} each other so well, you see." ...|$|R
60|$|She hesitated--nay, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> rather <b>say</b> paused, {{for there}} was little {{hesitation}} in what she did. She paused, as though weighing what she was to say next.|$|R
6000|$|Well, my inside {{begins to}} cry cupboard. I had breakfast early. We [...] have enough {{particulars}} now to face the Queen's Council with, <b>I</b> [...] <b>should</b> <b>say,</b> Sir Henry? ...|$|R
2500|$|Kenneth Arrow (1983) {{describes}} Foundations as [...] "the only example I know of {{a doctoral}} dissertation that is a treatise, perhaps <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> of a treatise that has so much originality in every part that it is entitled to be accepted as a thesis." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jorge Luis Borges {{was taught}} at home {{until the age}} of 11, was bilingual in Spanish and English, reading Shakespeare in the latter at the age of twelve. The family lived in a large house with an English library of over one {{thousand}} volumes; Borges would later remark that [...] "if I were asked to name the chief event in my life, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> my father's library." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anxieties that Brown {{might change}} the {{identity}} of The New Yorker as a cultural institution prompted a number of resignations. George Trow, {{who had been with}} the magazine for almost three decades, accused Brown of [...] "kissing the ass of celebrity" [...] in his resignation letter. (To which Brown reportedly replied, [...] "I am distraught at your defection but since you never actually write anything <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> I am notionally distraught.") The departing Jamaica Kincaid described Brown as [...] "a bully" [...] and [...] "Stalin in high heels." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} he has been here. I met him at the station at Exeter. Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>say</b> so, but I wish he had {{remained}} away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{only wish}} {{to observe that}} when a gentleman {{exhibits}} such a peculiar, or <b>I</b> <b>should</b> rather <b>say,</b> such a bloomin' curiosity in identification marks as our friend here----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. Her notions be different. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> rather <b>say</b> her {{thoughts}} were {{far away from}} here, with lords and ladies she'll never know, and mansions she'll never see again." ...|$|R
2500|$|It’s hard to {{say whether}} she’s a grand {{synthesis}} of all the pre-Raphaelite pictures ever made … whether she’s an original or a copy. In either case she’s a wonder. Imagine a tall lean woman in [...] a long dress of some dead purple stuff, guiltless of hoops (or of anything else <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say)</b> with a mass of crisp black hair heaped into great wavy projections on each of her temples … a long neck, without any collar, and in lieu thereof some dozen strings of outlandish beads.|$|E
2500|$|Since I {{was first}} moved by his poems, I have opened (knowing well, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say,</b> it’s a problem) {{the gates of}} my {{invisible}} garden [...] to him, and now he can do nothing for all eternity that would bring me to banish him from it. Compare, if you will, a real person to an anecdotal one, a late book to an earlier, the one you see to you yourself; but I am not putting a value on a poet, only recognizing that he is one—and {{the way he is}} one.|$|E
2500|$|At Indianapolis {{later in}} summer 2002, Busch was racing {{in the top}} ten. He aggressively passed Spencer on lap 37. In reply Spencer {{deliberately}} tapped Busch who then crashed into the turn 3 wall. Busch climbed out of his demolished car and until paramedics came, whenever he saw Spencer driving by him under caution, he pointed at Spencer and repeatedly shouted at him. When interviewed Kurt called Jimmy Spencer a [...] "decrepit old has-been or maybe <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> a never-was." [...] Spencer replied [...] "Kurt {{has a lot to}} learn, and some of that is to control his mouth".|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I spoke too hastily, mother," [...] Vincent {{said as he}} entered; [...] "and I am {{sure that}} you would not wish the slaves to be ill-treated more than <b>I</b> <b>should.</b> <b>I</b> dare <b>say</b> Jonas means for the best." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{even here}} Mrs. Westgate discriminated. “I don’t know that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{precisely}} <b>say</b> attractive. She’s {{not so much}} that as she’s charming when you really know her. She’s very shy.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} you nothing," [...] he said. [...] "I admit frankly my sympathies are not with you. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>say</b> a word likely to bring even {{inconvenience}} upon Miss Deveney." ...|$|R
2500|$|.....from {{the time}} that I came to the Holy Land, {{it has been my}} goal {{to the best of my}} ability to draw also those who are estranged and speak to their heart, so that they will come close to Torah and mitzvos – {{including}} even those young people who want to develop their physical health so that they will have the strength to protect our holy nation in times of violence, Heaven forbid, at a time when vicious enemies rise up against us...in regard to Hebrew University, Heaven forbid that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> regarding secular studies that 'From Zion will come forth Torah.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Jackson {{and his new}} teammates was strained due to an interview with SPORT magazine writer Robert Ward. During spring training at the Yankees' camp in Fort Lauderdale, Jackson and Ward were having drinks at a nearby bar. Jackson's {{version of the story}} is that he noted that the Yankees had won the pennant the year before, but lost the World Series to the Reds, and suggested that they needed one thing more to win it all, and pointed out the various ingredients in his drink. Ward suggested that Jackson might be [...] "the straw that stirs the drink." [...] But when the story appeared in the June 1977 issue of SPORT, Ward quoted Jackson as saying, [...] "This team, it all flows from me. I'm the straw that stirs the drink. Maybe <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> me and Munson, but he can only stir it bad." ...|$|E
2500|$|The XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment with {{attached}} infantry {{company and}} the 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery arrived at Beirut on 8 October. The city was occupied without opposition when 600 prisoners were captured. The remainder of the infantry division and artillery followed when the road enabled the movement of wheeled vehicles. Private Norman F. Rothon, a mule driver with the 13th Mountain Howitzer Battery, 8th Brigade RGA, 7th (Meerut) Division, arrived at Beirut {{on the evening of}} 9 October. He and his unit had marched [...] since 19 September; [...] of that total were marched between 8 and 9 October. Rothon wrote in his diary, [...] "if I was asked how I felt when we arrived <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> like a cripple and fairly doubled up and I hope I shall never experience another march like it the men tramping along with hollow cheeks and staring eyes, nothing to eat but the awful Bouilli & Biscuits and lots of the men go without as their stomachs cannot stand the awful repetition (we have had 3 weeks of it). My inside yearns for some ordinary food & vegetables." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{has been}} an inquest," [...] said I, [...] "and a good many fresh facts have come out. Looked at more closely, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{certainly}} <b>say</b> {{that it was a}} curious case." ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{the case}} of Fergusson is not one to pretend about. A more miserable tragedy the sun never shone upon, or (in {{consideration}} of our climate) <b>I</b> <b>should</b> rather <b>say</b> refused to brighten.--Yours truly, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mansfeld {{itself is}} little more than a village. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>say</b> it had more than a {{thousand}} inhabitants, and can muster at best about two hundred and fifty men capable of bearing arms." ...|$|R
