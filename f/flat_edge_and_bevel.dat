An edge-based AWB algorithm is performed using initial estimates instead of using a full color image. The AWB gain is obtained by using a predefined achromatic region and initial estimates in the edge region to prevent color failure situations when more than one uniform object existed in the image. In order to improve the performance and the computational complexity, the region is classified into <b>flat,</b> <b>edge,</b> <b>and</b> pattern regions at each pixel. Based on these preclassified region, the color demosaicing process with color constancy is performed {{to reduce the number}} of interpolation errors using the AWB gain and local statistics of the initial estimates.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} for controlling the adaptive quantization process in an MPEG encoder, which improves upon the commonly used Test Model 5 (TM 5) rate controller. The method combines both a spatial masking model and a technique for automatically determining the visually important areas in a scene. The spatial masking {{model has been}} designed with consideration {{of the structure of}} compressed natural images. It takes into account the different levels of distortion that are tolerable by viewers in different parts of a picture by segmenting the scene into <b>flat,</b> <b>edge,</b> <b>and</b> textured regions and quantizing these regions differently. The visually important areas are represented by Importance Maps. These maps are generated by combining factors known to influence human visual attention and eye movements. Lower quantization is assigned to visually important regions, while areas classified as being of low visual importance are more harshly quantized. Results indicate a subjective improvement in picture quality, in comparison to the TM 5 method. Less ringing occurs at <b>edges,</b> <b>and</b> the visually important areas of a picture are more accurately coded. This is particularly noticeable at low bit rates. The technique is computationally efficient and flexible, and can easily be extended to specific applications.

40|$|Abstract—The present {{environmental}} issues have made aircraft jet noise reduction a crucial problem in aero-acoustics research. Acoustic studies reveal that addition of chevrons to the nozzle reduces the {{sound pressure level}} reasonably with acceptable reduction in performance. In this paper comprehensive numerical studies on acoustic characteristics {{of different types of}} chevron nozzles have been carried out with non-reacting flows for the shape optimization of chevrons in supersonic nozzles for aerospace applications. The numerical studies have been carried out using a validated steady 3 D density based, k-ε turbulence model. In this paper chevron with sharp <b>edge,</b> <b>flat</b> <b>edge,</b> round <b>edge</b> <b>and</b> U-type <b>edge</b> are selected for the jet acoustic characterization of supersonic nozzles. We observed that compared to the base model a case with round-shaped chevron nozzle could reduce 4. 13 % acoustic level with 0. 6 % thrust loss. We concluded that the prudent selection of the chevron shape will enable an appreciable reduction of the aircraft jet noise without compromising its overall performance. It is evident from the present numerical simulations that k-ε model can predict reasonably well the acoustic level of chevron supersonic nozzles for its shape optimization...|$|R

40|$|Spreading {{resistance}} {{analysis on}} ultrashallow structures {{is complicated by}} the interaction of bevel rounding with geometric effects associated with lateral boundaries. When a spreading resistance probe is stepped from the original sample surface, across the rounded region at the <b>bevel</b> <b>edge</b> <b>and</b> onto the <b>bevel,</b> the resistance increases. Some of the increase is the result of approaching the lateral boundary represented by the <b>bevel,</b> <b>and</b> some is the result of increasing local sheet resistance as the probes begin to move below the original surface. We remove the geometric effect by solving the boundary value problem involving a sheet resistance which varies with distance along the direction of probe travel. Having obtained the local sheet resistance, we assign a depth for each point from profilometer data, and the usual depth-dependent analysis is used to obtain the resistivity profile. © 2002 American Vacuum Society.

40|$|Morse theory {{reveals the}} topological {{structure}} of a shape based on the critical points of a real function over the shape. A poor choice of this real function {{can lead to a}} complex configuration of an unnecessarily high number of critical points. This paper solves a relaxed form of Laplace’s equation to find a “fair ” Morse function with a user-controlled number and configuration of critical points. When the number is minimal, the resulting Morse complex cuts the shape into a disk. Specifying additional critical points at surface features yields a base domain that better represents the geometry and shares the same topology as the original mesh, and can also cluster a mesh into approximately developable patches. We make Morse theory on meshes more robust with teflon saddles <b>and</b> <b>flat</b> <b>edge</b> collapses, <b>and</b> devise a new “intermediate value propagation ” multigrid solver for finding fair Morse functions that runs in provably linear time...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the clinical features, prevalence, role of surgical intervention {{and the visual}} prognosis of macular holes (MH) in patients with Behcet′s disease (BD). Materials and Methods: Retrospective study of patients with BD and MH from January 1998 to November 2008. Results: Out of 159 patients, 21 eyes of 17 patients were identified with MH. The mean age was 38. 59 (range 23 - 61) years and the mean follow-up period was 5. 1 years (range 13 - 164 months). The prevalence of MH was 7 %. Visual acuity (VA) {{at the time of}} presentation ranged from 20 / 70 to hand-motion. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings revealed intraretinal cysts {{at the edge of the}} MH. The mean size of MH was 983. 6 um; 52 % had elevated edges, 43 % had <b>flat</b> <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> only one eye (5 %) was closed postoperatively. Fluorescein angiography (FA) was consistent with macular ischemia in 76 % of the cases. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B 51 association was found in 14 of the 15 patients investigated. Six patients (out of 17) underwent pars plana vitrectomy. The final VA on their last follow-up ranged from 20 / 70 to 2 / 200. Surgical intervention for MH did not result in any visual improvement as compared to non-operated eyes. One patient lost vision completely due to elevated intraocular pressure post vitrectomy and silicon oil tamponade. Conclusions: MH in patients with BD may lead to significant visual disability. Surgical intervention does not seem to have any potential beneficial effect on the VA, probably due to significant macular ischemia and sequelae from the ocular inflammation...|$|R
