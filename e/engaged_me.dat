60|$|I {{turned a}} little way from the man while these {{thoughts}} <b>engaged</b> <b>me,</b> for, indeed, I could no more refrain from tears than he.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Belong to me. You <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> by wire, {{you paid}} me the lowest rates you dared. You can't mean to keep them! Good God alive, man, they're all I've {{got in the}} world!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{immensity of}} the subject you have <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> on has {{completely}} crushed my subject out of me! Yours is celestial; mine lamentably human! And the less must {{give way to the}} greater.' ...|$|E
60|$|And Madame did <b>engage</b> <b>me</b> {{that very}} night--by God's blessing I was spared the {{necessity}} of passing forth again into the lonesome, dreary, hostile street.|$|R
60|$|Wood. [To TRICK.] You but {{suspect it}} at most, and cannot prove it: if you value me, {{you will not}} <b>engage</b> <b>me</b> in a quarrel with her husband.|$|R
60|$|But that afternoon, {{even in his}} eyes, I didn't shine. Failing {{any other}} stimulus, he reverted to my search for a situation, but even that did not <b>engage</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Belong to me. You <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> by wire, {{you paid}} me the lowest rates you dared. You can't mean to keep them! Good God alive, man, they're all I've {{got in the}} world!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I didn't {{think you}} could be so mean and cowardly,' she cried. 'You {{ought to be ashamed}} to talk about people behind their backs, when--when--besides, if he's what you say, how did it happen that you <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> on his recommendation?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{sister had}} such a pile of these pillow cases to make, that she was quite discouraged, and <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> to do {{half a dozen of}} them: when I first came in she was so busy she could not even speak to me." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had been}} {{standing}} a little behind his companion, Lakor, during our parley, and now, ere he could <b>engage</b> <b>me,</b> the older man grasped his harness and drew him back.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Engage</b> <b>me</b> {{a passage}} before the mast {{in the first}} vessel going to China. My own strong arm can pull me to China and can support me when I arrive there.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{answered}} two advertisements," [...] I said; [...] "one at a club, {{but they were}} no good. I am {{going to see a}} rich English lady to-morrow morning. She may <b>engage</b> <b>me</b> as butler." ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{disappointed}} to find {{he had so}} little bond with my young lady; and {{but that it was}} I who had sought the acquaintance, might have been tempted to retreat. At the same time something in the stranger's eye <b>engaged</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Warn. But, if I live, I'll cry quittance with him: he had <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> to get Mrs Millisent, your daughter, for him; but if I do not all I can to {{make her}} hate him! a great booby, an {{overgrown}} oaf, a conceited Bartlemew-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall see}} you sometimes, sahib; {{for the major}} <b>engaged</b> <b>me,</b> this morning, {{to go with him}} as his {{personal}} servant, as his own man is in feeble health and, though I am now getting on in years, I am still strong enough to travel with the regiment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not--I am not--I am not wise," [...] {{replied the}} horticulturist, pettishly, and {{stopping}} his ears with his fingers--"I was never called wise but when men wanted to <b>engage</b> <b>me</b> in some action of notorious folly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you know?" [...] said Betty, {{who gave}} her a searching look. [...] "For one thing, when you persuaded Mr. Jefferson to <b>engage</b> <b>me,</b> you had an object. You often have an object when people think you kind!" ...|$|R
60|$|He paused; and, though {{feeling the}} {{delicate}} {{nature of the}} discussion in which the conversation was likely to <b>engage</b> <b>me,</b> I could not help replying, that I did not doubt his present situation had much which must be most unpleasant to his feelings.|$|R
6000|$|... "They are {{a set of}} rich young {{students}} from Yale in their senior year who <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> to bring them hither for study and - er -- recreation. And that puts me in mind. You will not -- ahem -- {{say anything about the}} past to them, will you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good stuff!" [...] said Delano. [...] "I got mine there. Junius T. Rollins, the booker for Kuhn & Dooley, {{jumped on}} the stage and <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> after my dance. And the boards were an inch deep in nickels and dimes and quarters. There wasn't but nine penny pieces found in the lot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It ain't a story, lad. However, to make {{it short}} I may come to the pint at once. Isaac got engaged himself and {{mentioned}} my name to Mr Rudyerd, who took the trouble to ferret me out in the docks and--and in fact <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> for the work, which is to begin next week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{should not}} <b>engage</b> <b>me</b> rashly {{in such an}} adventure," [...] said Ravenswood; [...] "when I {{recollect}} the times {{of the first and}} second Charles, and of the last James, truly I see little reason that, as a man or a patriot, I should draw my sword for their descendants." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if {{he wants}} to get any out, he'd better call in {{somebody}} to rewrite it. You don't have to <b>engage</b> <b>me</b> if you don't want to. But I know I could make a good job of it. There's just one little twist the thing needs and you would have quite a different piece." ...|$|R
60|$|CUTHBERTSON (rising). No, he's <b>engaged</b> to <b>me.</b> But you {{can join}} us.|$|R
60|$|It {{was upon}} reading {{some of the}} abusive papers lately published, that my great regard to a person, whose {{friendship}} I esteem {{as one of the}} chief honours of my life, and a much greater respect to truth, than to him or any man living, <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> in inquiries, of which the enclosed notes are the fruit.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{was the old}} party what <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> a waitin' in the 'ouse at Purfleet. He 'elped me to {{lift the}} boxes {{and put them in}} the dray. Curse me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an' him a old feller, with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn't throw a shadder." ...|$|E
60|$|I never enjoyed {{myself in}} my life as much as I did at that ball. Lady Desborough {{introduced}} {{a good many of}} the first comers to me, and Percy brought up more. He had <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> for the first waltz, and he presently asked me for the first polka after supper; and my card was soon quite full for the whole evening.|$|E
6000|$|Seb. What mak'st thou of thyself, {{and what}} of me? Art thou some ghost, some demon, or some god, That I should stand {{astonished}} at thy sight? If thou could'st deem so meanly of my courage, Why didst thou not <b>engage</b> <b>me</b> man for man, And try the virtue of that Gorgon face, To stare me into statue? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have your}} letter <b>engaging</b> <b>me</b> in my pocket," [...] said Tommy, boldly, and he {{laid it on}} the table. Pym {{surveyed}} it and him in comic dismay, then with a sudden thought produced nearly a dozen letters from a drawer, and dumped them down beside the other. It was now his turn to look triumphant and Tommy aghast.|$|R
60|$|The other thern was <b>engaging</b> <b>me</b> at the time, and I was {{forcing him}} back--touching him {{here and there}} with my point until he was {{bleeding}} from a dozen wounds, yet {{not being able to}} penetrate his marvelous guard to reach a vulnerable spot for the brief instant that would have been sufficient to send him to his ancestors.|$|R
60|$|I {{thought this}} very kind, and indeed I found {{afterwards}} that the terms on which M. Pelet had <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> were really liberal for Brussels; instruction being extremely cheap there {{on account of}} the number of teachers. It was further arranged that I should be installed in my new post the very next day, after which M. Pelet and I parted.|$|E
60|$|Ten years ago, I took my {{credentials}} to an English gentleman at Long's Hotel, in Bond Street, London, {{who was about}} to travel - it might be for one year, it might be for two. He approved of them; likewise of me. He was pleased to make inquiry. The testimony that he received was favourable. He <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> by the six months, and my entertainment was generous.|$|E
60|$|Wood. [Taking him aside.] Hark you, Mr Brainsick, is {{the devil}} in you, {{that you and}} your wife come hither, to disturb my intrigue, which you {{yourself}} <b>engaged</b> <b>me</b> in, with Mrs Tricksy, to revenge you on Limberham? Why, I had made an appointment with her here; but, hearing somebody come up, I retired into the closet, till I was satisfied it was not the keeper.|$|E

'This {{is to let}} {{you know}} that as I am {{extremely}} necessitous for money, it <b>engages</b> <b>me</b> out of economi to send for Daniell's Close which you are to Pack up in his own trunc, and to send it adresed to Mr. Woulfe to Paris, but let there be in ye trunc none of Daniel's Papers or anything else except his Close.' ...|$|R
50|$|What did <b>engage</b> <b>me</b> was {{baseball}} statistics. I {{spent a lot}} of my {{free time}} reading online forums devoted to baseball, and I discovered that baseball statistics had moved far beyond the stats {{on the backs of the}} baseball cards I grew up with. I started designing my own customized statistics in the mid-1990s and eventually posted them on Usenet newsgroups and my own Web page.|$|R
