40|$|Purpose - Although {{studies on}} student {{residential}} satisfaction abound, {{yet there are}} limited studies conducted on students’ satisfaction in respect of hostel <b>accommodation</b> <b>facilities</b> undertaken through public-private partnerships (PPPs) in Nigeria. The {{purpose of this study}} is to assess the level of students’ satisfaction with the provision of university hostel <b>accommodation</b> <b>facility</b> using build-operate-transfer (BOT) model at University of Lagos (Unilag), Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach - The study adopted literature review and questionnaire survey within the case study of a BOT hostel <b>accommodation</b> <b>facility</b> at Unilag in Nigeria. The students who reside at the case study were the respondents. Hence, 153 self-administered questionnaires were purposively distributed face-to-face to the entire student population that live in the BOT hostel. Thus, a total of 96 completed questionnaires representing 63 per cent were collected and found suitable for the analysis. The data collected were analysed using the mean score and chi-square (χ 2) test. Findings - The study revealed a total mean satisfaction level of 3. 46 (on a 5 -point Likert scale), which indicates that students are “somehow satisfied” with the university hostel <b>accommodation</b> <b>facility</b> undertaken through BOT. The study further established that age and level of students have no significant influence on the overall students’ satisfaction with their hostel <b>accommodation</b> <b>facility</b> undertaken through BOT. Practical implications - The study would provide valuable feedback to private investors, university authorities and facility managers of higher education institutions to improve their services in the near future. Originality/value - The identified variables that have tested to be significant in assessing students’ level of satisfaction in BOT hostel <b>accommodation</b> <b>facilities</b> could be used to assess users’ satisfaction in similar facilities delivered through PPPs in other countries...|$|R
