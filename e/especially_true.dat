5|$|Dyadic joint {{attention}} is a conversation-like behavior that individuals engage in. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> for human adults and infants, {{who engage in}} this behavior starting at two months of age.

5|$|Merits: As Weber himself noted, real {{bureaucracy}} {{will be less}} optimal {{and effective}} than his ideal-type model. Each of Weber's principles can degenerateand more so, when {{they are used to}} analyze the individual level in an organization. But, when implemented in a group setting in an organization, some form of efficiency and effectiveness can be achieved, especially with regard to better output. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> when the Bureaucratic model emphasizes qualification (merits), specialization of job-scope (labour), hierarchy of power, rules and discipline.|$|E

5|$|Several common {{birds in}} North America, {{such as the}} house sparrow, the rock pigeon, the European {{starling}} and the mute swan are introduced species, meaning {{that they are not}} native to this continent but were brought here by humans from Europe or elsewhere. Introduced species are marked on this list as (I). There may be species that have individual escapees or small feral populations in North America that are not on this list. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> of birds that are commonly held as pets, such as parrots and finches.|$|E
5|$|Several of Chicago's most {{important}} historical figures have {{lived on the}} street. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> of the period of recovery from the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 when many of the {{most important}} families in the city moved to the street. Residents of the street have influenced the evolution of the city and have played prominent national and international roles. They have influenced the political history, the architecture, the culture, the economy, as well as the law and government of Chicago. The street has over time been influenced by the demographics of Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Stalin's {{willingness}} to expend recently conscripted armies, which were poorly trained and poorly supplied, illustrated a misconception of realities, {{both in the}} capabilities of the Red Army and the subordinate arms of the armed forces, and in the abilities of the Germans to defend themselves and successfully launch a counteroffensive. The latter proved <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> in the subsequent Case Blue, which led to the Battle of Stalingrad, though this was the battle in which Paulus faced an entirely different outcome.|$|E
50|$|The African {{telecommunication}} {{market is}} growing {{at a faster rate}} than {{in the rest of the}} world.

Development of botanical gardens in China over recent years has been a remarkable, including the Hainan Botanical Garden of Tropical Economic Plants South China Botanical Garden at Guangzhou, the Xishuangbanna Botanical Garden of Tropical Plants and the Xiamen Botanic Garden, but in developed countries, many have closed for lack of financial support, this being <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> of botanical gardens attached to universities.|$|E
5|$|In tsunami prone regions, strong {{earthquakes}} {{serve as}} familiar warnings, {{and this is}} <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> for earthquakes in Indonesia. Previous estimates of the tsunami hazard for the Java coastline may have minimized the risk to the area, and to the northwest along the Sumatran coast, the risk is substantially higher for tsunami, especially near Padang. Previous events {{along the coast of}} Java in 1921 and again in 1994 illustrate the need for an accurate assessment of the threat. The July 2006 earthquake had an unusually slow rupture velocity which resulted in minor shaking on land for around three minutes, but the intensity was very light relative {{to the size of the}} tsunami that followed.|$|E
50|$|According to most {{economic}} historians, economies {{have experienced}} less severe boom-bust cycles after World War II, because governments {{have addressed the}} problem of economic recessions. Many argued, prior {{to the events of}} 2008, that this has <b>especially</b> been <b>true</b> since the 1980s because central banks were granted more independence and started using monetary policy to stabilize the business cycle, an event known as The Great Moderation.|$|R

5|$|Most Armenian {{geographical}} names {{were in the}} eastern provinces of the Ottoman empire. Villages, settlements, or towns that contain the suffix -kert, meaning built or built by (i.e. Manavazkert (today Malazgirt), Norakert, Dikranagert, Noyakert), -shen, meaning village (i.e. Aratashen, Pemzashen, Norashen), and -van, meaning town (i.e. Charentsavan, Nakhichevan, Tatvan), signify an Armenian name. Throughout Ottoman history, Turkish and Kurdish tribesmen have settled into Armenian villages and changed the native Armenian names (i.e. the Armenian Norashen was changed to Norşin). This was <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> after the Armenian genocide, when much of eastern Turkey was depopulated of its Armenian population.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the electrode core is generally similar and sometimes identical {{to that of the}} base material. But even though a number of feasible options exist, a slight difference in alloy composition can strongly impact the properties of the resulting weld. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> of alloy steels such as HSLA steels. Likewise, electrodes of compositions {{similar to those of the}} base materials are often used for welding nonferrous materials like aluminium and copper. However, sometimes it is desirable to use electrodes with core materials significantly different from the base material. For example, stainless steel electrodes are sometimes used to weld two pieces of carbon steel, and are often utilized to weld stainless steel workpieces with carbon steel workpieces.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{areas are}} the poorest. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> for Topaana, in Čair municipality, and for Šuto Orizari municipality, {{which are the}} two main Roma neighbourhoods. They are made of many illegal constructions not connected to electricity and water supply, which are passed from a generation to the other. Topaana, located close to the Old Bazaar, is a very old area: it was first mentioned as a Roma neighbourhood {{in the beginning of}} the 14th century. It has between 3,000 and 5,000 inhabitants. Šuto Orizari, located on the northern edge of the city, is a municipality of its own, with Romani as its local official language. It was developed after the 1963 earthquake to accommodate Roma who had lost their house.|$|E

The libation ritual is commonly called challa and is performed quite often, usually before meals and during celebrations.|$|R
50|$|In the inter-war years, it {{was common}} for cruisers and battleships to be {{equipped}} with catapult-launched reconnaissance seaplanes.

5|$|There are {{virtually}} no {{parts of the}} world left where the weapon dance is directly connected with imminent or recent combat. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> of European states, which have long since moved away from the tribalism that usually gives rise to such folk dances. It is, however, also true of {{parts of the world}} where tribal traditions have succumbed to colonialism and the forces of globalism. The dances that one sees today are often part of general movements to preserve and rejuvenate tribal or local traditions. Some of these movements are quite strong now, such as those among native North American tribes and the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} often {{confused}} with the copperhead, A. contortrix. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> for juveniles, but differences exist. A. piscivorus has broad, dark stripes {{on the sides of}} its head that extend back from the eye, whereas A. contortrix has only a thin, dark line that divides the pale supralabials from the somewhat darker color of the head. The watersnakes of the genus Nerodia are also similar in appearance, being thick-bodied with large heads, but they have round pupils, no loreal pit, a single anal plate, subcaudal scales that are divided throughout, and a distinctive overall color pattern.|$|E
5|$|At universities, {{appointments}} to top posts were {{the subject of}} power struggles between the education ministry, the university boards and the National Socialist German Students' League. In spite of pressure from the League and various government ministries, most university professors did not make changes to their lectures or syllabus during the Nazi period. This was <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> of universities located in predominately Catholic regions. Enrolment at German universities declined from 104,000 students in 1931 to 41,000 in 1939, but enrolment in medical schools rose sharply as Jewish doctors {{had been forced to}} leave the profession, so medical graduates had good job prospects. From 1934, university students were required to attend frequent and time-consuming military training sessions run by the SA. First-year students also had to serve six months in a labour camp for the Reichsarbeitsdienst (National Labour Service); an additional ten weeks service were required of second-year students.|$|E

30|$|The rare {{aggressive}} NK-cell leukemia (ANKL) {{is primarily}} described in Asian and South American populations (Lima 2013). The disease entity {{is described in}} the World Health Organization (WHO) classification for hematopoietic tumors and lymphoid tissues in 2008 but remains poorly characterized as the majority of publications comprise sporadic case reports. This <b>especially</b> holds <b>true</b> for European cases. The course of the disease is rapidly aggravating and nearly always fatal since the neoplastic cells respond poorly to therapy.|$|R
5|$|Nearby {{tracts of}} habitat {{strongly}} affect the wildlife in the Balch Creek watershed.

Birds and animals from these watersheds {{and from the}} Tualatin River valley, the Coast Range, the Willamette River, Sauvie Island, the Columbia River, and the Vancouver, Washington, lowlands, {{move in and out}} of the park with relative ease. Sixty-two mammal species, including the northern flying squirrel, black-tailed deer, creeping vole, bobcat, coyote, Mazama pocket gopher, little brown bat, Roosevelt elk, and Pacific jumping mouse use Forest Park. blue grouse, great horned owl, hairy woodpecker, Bewick's wren, orange-crowned warbler, osprey, and hermit thrush are among the 112species of birds that frequent the area. Amphibian species seen at the Audubon Society pond include rough-skinned newts, Pacific tree frogs, and salamanders.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1907, Kafka {{was hired}} at the , an {{insurance}} company, {{where he worked}} for nearly a year. His correspondence during that period indicates that he was unhappy with a working time schedule—from 08:00 until 18:00—making it extremely difficult to concentrate on writing, which was assuming increasing importance to him. On 15 July 1908, he resigned. Two weeks later he found employment more amenable to writing {{when he joined the}} Worker's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. The job involved investigating and assessing compensation for personal injury to industrial workers; accidents such as lost fingers or limbs were commonplace at this time owing to poor work safety policies at the time. It was <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> of factories fitted with machine lathes, drills, planing machines and rotary saws which were rarely fitted with safety guards.|$|E
5|$|South of Ardnamurchan, Gaelic {{place names}} are more common, {{and after the}} 13th century, Gaelic became the main {{language}} of the entire Hebridean archipelago. Due to Scots and English being favored in government and the educational system, the Hebrides {{have been in a}} state of diglossia since at least the seventeenth century. The Highland Clearances of the nineteenth century accelerated the language shift away from Scottish Gaelic, as did increased migration and the continuing lower status of Gaelic speakers. Nevertheless, as late {{as the end of the}} nineteenth century, there were significant populations of monolingual Gaelic speakers, and the Hebrides still contain the highest percentages of Gaelic speakers in Scotland. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> of the Outer Hebrides, where a slim majority speak the language. The Scottish Gaelic college, Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, is based on Skye and Islay.|$|E
