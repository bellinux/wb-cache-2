40|$|Making {{decisions}} about handling a crop that has incurred major hail damage is difficult at best. Be sure {{to make a}} damage assessment on a block by block basis, consider marketing alternatives available to the individual grower, and re-evaluate insurance options {{as a means of}} reducing risk. Hail damage affected an estimated 7, 453 acres in Ulster, Columbia,Dutchess, and Orange Counties in 2000. Major hail events occurred in May, June, and again in August with some or-chards being affected twice. Many grow-ers faced the decision as to whether to har-vest these blocks for fresh utilization, har-vest for juice, or to leave the fruit unhar-vested. Cornell Cooperative Extension con-ducted damage assessments for the region following the May storm. Initial estimates from a grower survey indicated a loss of more than 2 million bushels of fruit, val-ued at $ 19. 8 million. The {{purpose of this article is}} to conduct a retrospective analysis of the decisions that growers made this past crop year re-garding harvesting <b>hail</b> <b>damaged</b> fruit. The emphasis of the article is to analyze what lessons were learned from the 2000 experience that will help growers make a better decision in the future when faced with the decision about how to handle a crop that has experienced significant hail damage. The economic decision rule in the case of crop damage from hail or other natu-ral disasters is simple. The grower needs to attempt to minimize subsequent losses. Thus, the economic decision is to harvest only if the expected receipts from sale of the fruit exceeds the direct expenses for the remainder of the season. Fixed costs, such as depreciation, interest, and prop-erty taxes are irrelevant to the decision, as are “sunk costs ” such as fertilizer...|$|E
40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} for eight years in southwest Kansas near Garden City to measure the response of corn and grain sorghum to limited irrigation in the region. An irrigation variable was imposed on each crop, with six irrigation treatments from full irrigation scheduled to minimize soil water deficits to minimal or no irrigation. To create differences {{in the amount of}} irrigation across treatments, the time between 25 -mm irrigation events increased as irrigation decreased. A historic drought occurred during 2011 and 2012 when cropping season precipitation, the precipitation occurring from the harvest of the prior crop through the harvest of the next crop, was 60 % of the 30 -year average. Except for 2008, average cropping season precipitation was 8 % above average during the prior six years. Linear regressions of corn and sorghum grain yields (GY) and dry matter yields (DMY) versus crop evapotranspiration (ETc) from all years combined, except <b>hail</b> <b>damaged</b> sorghum in 2005, produced R 2 values from 0. 71 to 0. 79. One hailstorm during 2005 damaged sorghum to the extent that yields did not vary with respect to ETc or irrigation. Hail events in 2005 and 2006 occurred at nearly the same growth stage for corn caused lower leaf area and yields than during other wet years with no hail. Using quadratic regressions, corn yields during wet years with no hail, wet years with hail, and dry years had distinctly different dependence on irrigation. Although sorghum yields during wet years tended to increase as irrigation increased, sorghum’s response to irrigation was less than for corn during the same years. During dry years, sorghum and corn were highly dependent on irrigation. Net economic returns (NR) of continuous corn, continuous sorghum, cornsorghum, corn-wheat, and sorghum-wheat rotations were each higher with a year receiving average precipitation (460 mm) than a year receiving 60 % of average precipitation (280 mm). The NR of continuous corn dominated the rest of the rotations when irrigation was more than 230 to 330 mm in the dry year and 90 to 180 mm in wet year. As farmers choose crop rotations, they need to consider management factors and crop tolerance to soil water stress in addition to potential NR...|$|E
