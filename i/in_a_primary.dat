5|$|Gravel {{did not run}} for {{re-election}} in 1966, instead choosing to run for Alaska's seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, losing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>primary</b> to four-term incumbent Democrat Ralph Rivers by 1,300 votes and splitting the Democratic party in the process. Rivers lost the general election that year to Republican state Senator Howard Wallace Pollock.|$|E

5|$|Al-Hajj Muhammad was {{initially}} educated in Dhinnaba's kuttab, a traditional elementary school. In 1899–1900 he was enrolled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>primary</b> school in Tulkarm. Later, {{he would work}} the fields of his lands alongside his father and occasionally traveled with him from place to place, selling their agricultural products. During World War I (1914–18) he was conscripted into the Ottoman army (a requirement for male Ottoman citizens), posted outside of Palestine in Tripoli and Beirut. He returned following the Ottomans' defeat by British forces and their Hashemite Arab allies. His father had died sometime during the war. In 1920 Britain, which had already been {{in control of the}} area, established a mandate over Palestine {{under the auspices of the}} League of Nations.|$|E
5|$|As a Senator, Gravel became {{nationally known}} for his {{forceful}} but unsuccessful attempts to end the draft during the War in Vietnam and for putting the Pentagon Papers into the public record in 1971 at some risk to himself. He conducted an unusual campaign for the Democratic nomination in 1972 for Vice President of the United States, and then {{played a crucial role}} in getting Congressional approval for the Trans-Alaska pipeline in 1973. He was re-elected to the Senate in 1974, but gradually alienated most of his Alaskan constituencies and his bid for a third term was defeated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>primary</b> election in 1980.|$|E

5|$|Ford ran {{to succeed}} Mark Sanford as Governor of South Carolina in the 2010 gubernatorial election. His {{platform}} included reinstating video poker {{to the state}} to generate returns from taxes on the gaming industry {{in an effort to}} balance the state budget, something he has proposed since the late 1990s. A law Ford sponsored in 2008 to make gambling legal failed to advance; he planned a voter referendum to repeal the ban. Ford faced state senator Vincent A. Sheheen of Camden and State Superintendent of Education Jim Rex <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>primary</b> election. Sheheen's campaign has raised $33,000 as of January 2009, while Ford's campaign raised $6,000. On June 8, 2010, Ford finished in third place in the primary election with 18percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Gravel was {{challenged}} for the Democratic Party's nomination by State Representative Clark Gruening, {{the grandson of}} the man Gravel had defeated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>primary</b> 12 years earlier. Several factors made Gravel vulnerable. As an insurgent candidate in 1968, Gravel had never established a firm party base. Not liking to hunt or fish, he was also always culturally suspect in the state. A group of Democrats, including future governor Steve Cowper, led the campaign against Gravel, with Gravel's actions in respect to the 1978 and 1980 Alaskan lands bills a major issue, especially given that the latter's dénouement happened but {{a week before the}} primary. The sources of Gravel's campaign funds, some of which came from political action committees outside the state, also became an issue in the contest. Another factor may have been Alaska's blanket primary system of the time, which allowed unlimited voting across party lines and from its many independents; Republicans believed Gruening would be an easier candidate to defeat in the general election.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{worldwide}} plant reduction {{resulting from}} the difficulties plants encountered in adjusting to the new climate caused a progressive fragmentation and collapse of rainforest ecosystems. This reinforced and so further accelerated the collapse by sharply {{reducing the amount of}} animal life which could be supported by the shrinking ecosystems at that time. The outcome of this animal reduction was a crash in global carbon dioxide levels, which impacted the plants even more. The aridity and temperature drop which resulted from this runaway plant reduction and decrease <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>primary</b> greenhouse gas caused the Earth to rapidly enter a series of intense Ice Ages.|$|E
50|$|With this {{variation}} <b>in</b> size comes <b>a</b> variation <b>in</b> importance. If <b>a</b> medium-sized {{state like}} Maryland (8 districts) were paired up with California <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 130-district <b>primary,</b> {{the state would}} have little importance. If, on the other hand, it were paired up with smaller states <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 45-district <b>primary,</b> Maryland would suddenly be center-stage.|$|R
