5|$|Historically, {{frequent}} wars ravaged Badajoz's {{economy and}} people were poor. Agricultural land was not fertile with no industry of any major importance in its territory. However, the historic monuments in the town and also in Mérida were major attractions to visitors, leading {{to the growth of}} tourism, and in recent years there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> industrial development.|$|E
5|$|The series proved {{popular with}} American audiences and {{critical}} response, though sparse, was positive. Flash Gordon has garnered little modern critical attention.

5|$|There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> {{dispute over}} {{the extent to which}} Kierkegaard {{influenced}} Bohr's philosophy and science. David Favrholdt argued that Kierkegaard had minimal influence over Bohr's work, taking Bohr's statement about disagreeing with Kierkegaard at face value, while Jan Faye argued that one can disagree with the content of a theory while accepting its general premises and structure.|$|E

5|$|The 2007 IPCC report noted many {{observed}} {{changes in}} the climate, including atmospheric composition, global average temperatures, ocean conditions, and others. The report concluded the observed increase in tropical cyclone intensity is larger than climate models predict. In addition, the report considered that {{it is likely that}} storm intensity will continue to increase through the 21st century, and declared it more likely than not that there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> human contribution to the increases in tropical cyclone intensity.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{comprises}} four individual {{pieces of}} oak, painted over a chalk ground bound with glue. The preparation wood is dated to around 1410, giving an estimated {{date for the}} Van der Weyden in the mid-1430s. The dominant pigments are lead white (often used in the panel to highlight blue and green passages), charcoal black, ultramarine, lead-tin-yellow, verdigris and red lake. There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> discolouration– some greens are now brown, including pigments used to depict grass in the background.|$|E
5|$|There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> {{debate over}} the {{relationship}} of Mammuthus to Loxodonta or Elephas. Some DNA studies suggest Mammuthus is {{more closely related to}} the former while others point to the latter. However, analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome profile of the woolly mammoth (sequenced in 2005) supports Mammuthus being more closely related to Elephas. Morphological evidence supports Mammuthus and Elephas as sister taxa while comparisons of protein albumin and collagen have concluded that all three genera are equally related to each other. Some scientists believe a cloned mammoth embryo could one day be implanted in an Asian elephant's womb.|$|E

5|$|There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> {{evidence}} {{that prior to}} this charter, the royal heralds had already in some ways behaved like a corporation as early as 1420. Nevertheless, the charter is the earliest surviving document to affirm the chapter as a corporate body of heralds. The charter outlines {{the constitution of the}} officers, their hierarchy, the privileges conferred upon them and their jurisdiction over all heraldic matters in the Kingdom of England.|$|E
5|$|Widnes {{continues}} to be an industrial town and its major industry is still the manufacture of chemicals although there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> diversification in recent years. In 2006 a new freight park, known as the 3MG Mersey Multimodal Gateway, was opened in the West Bank area of the town. This provides a link for freight arriving by road, air or sea to be transferred to the rail network. It is expected to create up to 5,000 new jobs.|$|E
5|$|Familial dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} (DCM) {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} systolic heart failure (prevalence 1:5000). A wider range of mutations (including some non-sarcomeric proteins as well) is associated with DCM. The cTnC mutations associated with DCM thus far are Y5H, Q50R, D75Y, M103I, D145E (also associated with HCM), I148V, and G159D. Of these, Q50R and G159D co-segregated with disease in affected family members, increasing confidence that they are clinically significant mutations. The biochemical consequences of thin filament DCM-associated mutations are less well established than for HCM, although there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> suggestion {{that some of the}} mutations abolish the calcium desensitizing effect of cTnI phosphorylation at Ser22/23. This may be because some mutations disrupt the precise positioning of cNTnC for triggering muscle contraction when cTnI is unphosphorylated.|$|E

5|$|Gilchrist {{opened the}} batting against Sri Lanka in the final. This was Gilchrist's third {{successive}} World Cup final, {{and the third}} time he scored at least a 50 runs in World Cup finals {{and he went on}} to make his only ever century in a world cup match. Gilchrist went on to score 149 runs off 104 balls with thirteen fours and eight sixes, the highest individual score in a World Cup final, eclipsing his captain Ricky Ponting's score of 140 in the 2003 final. Australia won and he was named the man of the match. Subsequently there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> controversy over Gilchrist's use of a squash ball inside his glove during this innings.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata has no {{generally}} recognised synonyms. However, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> {{debate about}} {{its status as}} a single species; due to the wide geographic and morphological variation of the species, some authors have proposed multiple species and varieties. In response, mycologist Thom Kuyper has listed over thirty specific names and varieties as synonyms of Inocybe lacera, which is still generally recognised. It has also been suggested that Inocybe lanatodisca is a synonym, but where the species occur together, they can be distinguished from each other, and so it is still recognised as distinct. The form I.maculata f. fulva was named and described in 1991 by Marcel Bon in France. Inocybe maculata is commonly known as the frosty fibrecap.|$|E
5|$|The Italian Lives {{constitute}} {{the first two}} volumes of Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain and Portugal. The poet, journalist, and literary historian James Montgomery contributed the biographies of Dante, Ariosto, and Tasso. Historian of science Sir David Brewster contributed that of Galileo. Mary Shelley contributed the rest: Petrarch, Boccaccio, Lorenzo de'Medici, Marsiglio Ficino, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Angelo Poliziano, Bernardo Pulci, Luca Pulci, Luigi Pulci, Cieco Da Ferrara, Burchiello, Bojardo, Berni, Machiavelli, Guicciardini, Vittoria Colonna, Guarini, Chiabrera, Tassoni, Marini, Filicaja, Metastasio, Goldoni, Alfieri, Monti, and Ugo Foscolo. Although there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> confusion regarding the attribution of these biographies, the Livess recent editor, Tilar Mazzeo, notes that Shelley claimed authorship {{of all of these}} and granted Montgomery and Brewster's authorship of the others in her letters.|$|E

5|$|The Millennium Park {{project has}} been the subject of some {{criticism}} since its inception. In addition to concerns about cost overruns, individuals and organizations have complained that the money spent on the park might have gone to other worthy causes, citing poverty in Chicago and problems in the city's schools. Although the park's design and architectural elements have won wide praise, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> criticism of its aesthetics. Other criticism has revolved around the larger issue of corruption and political favoritism in the city; The New York Times reported in July 2004 that an inflated contract for park cleanup had gone to a company that made large contributions to Mayor Daley's election campaign. The park's only full service restaurant, Park Grill, has been criticized for its connection to numerous friends and associates of the mayor.|$|E
5|$|The walrus is a mammal in {{the order}} Carnivora. It is the sole {{surviving}} {{member of the family}} Odobenidae, one of three lineages in the suborder Pinnipedia along with true seals (Phocidae) and eared seals (Otariidae). While there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> debate as to whether all three lineages are monophyletic, i.e. descended from a single ancestor, or diphyletic, recent genetic evidence suggests all three descended from a caniform ancestor most closely related to modern bears. Recent multigene analysis indicates the odobenids and otariids diverged from the phocids about 20–26 million years ago, while the odobenids and the otariids separated 15–20 million years ago. Odobenidae was once a highly diverse and widespread family, including at least twenty species in the subfamilies Imagotariinae, Dusignathinae and Odobeninae. The key distinguishing feature was the development of a squirt/suction feeding mechanism; tusks are a later feature specific to Odobeninae, of which the modern walrus is the last remaining (relict) species.|$|E
5|$|There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> {{controversy}} regarding which European {{settlement is}} the oldest in North America. As mentioned above, while English fishermen had set up seasonal camps in St. John's in the 16th century, they were expressly forbidden by the English government, {{at the urging of}} the West Country fishing industry, from establishing permanent settlements along the English controlled coast. As a result, the town of St. John's was not established as a 'permanent' community until after the 1630s. With respect to the oldest surviving permanent English settlements in North America, it was preceded by Jamestown, Virginia (1607), the Cuper's Cove colony at Cupids (1610), St. George's, Bermuda (1612) and the Bristol's Hope colony at Harbour Grace (1618).|$|E

5|$|Though {{this era}} in Galveston's history has not {{received}} {{a great deal of}} attention in popular culture (compared, for example, to Al Capone's Chicago), there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> popular fiction and true crime story-telling centered on the era. Some notable examples include the novels Under the Skin by James Carlos Blake, No Greater Deception: A True Texas Story by Sydney Dotson, Galveston by Suzanne Morris, and Overlords by Matt Braun, as well as the anthology Lone Star Sleuths: An Anthology of Texas Crime Fiction by Bill Davis, et al. Galveston's Balinese Room was also the subject of a 1975 song by rock band ZZ Top.|$|E
5|$|Threats to B.cuneata include land clearing, {{which leads}} to direct plant loss and {{population}} fragmentation, grazing pressure, competition from exotic weeds, changes to the fire regime, and encroaching salinity. The Banksia Atlas survey found one population {{to be on the}} side of a road; the plants were aging with no new seedlings noted, and the site was weed-infested. A large part of the surviving populations are on private land, and depend on good relationships with local landowners. Many have obliged by fencing off areas and restricting entry of rabbits. There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> attempt by CALM to translocate populations away from hazardous areas; these have met with some success, helped with watering in the first year.|$|E
5|$|A typical P. exclamans worker {{will live}} somewhere between 14–16 days. The oldest wasp to be {{observed}} in a natural colony was 102 days old. Queens typically live 6 times longer than the workers. There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> variation observed with the life expectancy of P. exclamans. This has typically been attributed to the colony of origin. It also {{must be noted that}} while there is variation between colonies, there typically is less variation between the original nest and the satellite nest. Variation inside a single colony may also occur {{because of the presence of}} different castes. Foragers, those who frequently travel outside the nest, lead a riskier life and tend to have lower life expectancy than those who stay in the nest. Though, it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for the lower life expectancy. Another interesting aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase in female population led to lower longevity. This was because the females were more focused on competing to become the next queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles.|$|E
