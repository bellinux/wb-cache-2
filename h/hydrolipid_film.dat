40|$|The {{ability of}} {{dihydroxyacetone}} (D. H. A.) to react with the amino acids found naturally in the <b>hydrolipid</b> <b>film</b> {{and the first}} layers of the stratum corneum has been commonly used to produce a simulated sun tan on skin. This process results in imperfect development and wear resistance of the color. Therefore {{the purpose of this}} work was to improve the regularity, the tone, and the rate of the color development, and, moreover, to obtain a skin substantive color having affinity for the keratin of the stratum corneum. By analogy with quaternary ammonium compounds which exhibit keratin subtantivity, a sulfur-containing amino acid was made substantive without changing the amino function, the latter being necessary for the Maillard color-forming reaction. Therefore, the sulfur atom was used to form a sulfonium or a sulfoxide functional group. In vitro studies of mixtures of D. H. A. with amino acids in aqueous olutions carried out under standard conditions showed that methionine sulfoxide was the product yielding the optimum intensity and speed of color â€¢tevelopment. In vivo studies confirmed that methionine sulfoxide in an appropriate xcipient when rubbed on the skin before the application of a D. H. A. -containing cream increased the development and the intensity of color...|$|E
