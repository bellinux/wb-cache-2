5|$|Gabriel Ramanantsoa, a {{major general}} in the army, was {{appointed}} interim president and prime minister that same year, but low public approval forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> down in 1975. Colonel Richard Ratsimandrava, appointed to succeed him, was assassinated six days into his tenure. General Gilles Andriamahazo ruled after Ratsimandrava for four months before being replaced by another military appointee: Vice Admiral Didier Ratsiraka, who ushered in the socialist-Marxist Second Republic that ran under his tenure from 1975 to 1993.|$|E
5|$|The {{days leading}} up to the {{elections}} saw the resignations of several high-profile cabinet ministers. These included the Europe Minister Caroline Flint, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, the Minister for Children Beverley Hughes, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Hazel Blears, and Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell, who resigned minutes after the polls for the local and European elections had closed and sent a letter to the Prime Minister calling on <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> aside.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{suffered}} {{a car crash}} in the Río Negro province in 1999, during the campaign of governor Pablo Verani. They were on Route6, and he was ejected from the car {{because he was not}} wearing a seat belt. He was hospitalized for 39 days. DelaRúa became president in the 1999 elections, defeating the governor of Buenos Aires, Eduardo Duhalde. Alfonsín was elected Senator for Buenos Aires Province in October 2001. DelaRúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, and the Congress appointed Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, who resigned as well. Alfonsín instructed the radical legislators to support Duhalde as the new president. He also gave him two ministers, Horacio Jaunarena for Defense and Jorge Vanossi for Justice. The radical support helped Duhalde overcome the ambitions of Carlos Ruckauf and José Manuel de la Sota, who also had ambitions to be appointed president. Alfonsín's health problems later in the year led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> down, to be replaced by Diana Conti.|$|E
60|$|Garnache paid no heed <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> He <b>stepped</b> <b>to</b> the girl, {{and roughly}} raised her chin {{with his hand}} so that she was forced <b>to</b> look <b>him</b> in the face.|$|R
60|$|He {{crossed the}} floor and by and by Kit got up. Mrs. Austin gave him her hand and Olivia went with <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the <b>steps.</b>|$|R
50|$|In late 2005 Baker was {{appointed}} as a selector to the Westmeath senior hurling team. The appointment was short-lived as work commitments resulted in <b>him</b> having <b>to</b> <b>step</b> down.|$|R
5|$|In mid-2008, Brown's {{leadership}} {{was presented with}} a challenge as some MPs openly called for him to resign. This event was dubbed the 'Lancashire Plot', as two backbenchers from (pre-1974) Lancashire urged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> down and a third questioned his chances of {{holding on to the}} Labour Party leadership. Several MPs argued that if Brown did not recover in the polls by early 2009, he should call for a leadership contest. However, certain prominent MPs, such as Jacqui Smith and Bill Rammell, suggested that Brown was the right person to lead Britain through its economic crisis. In the Autumn, Siobhain McDonagh, a MP and junior government whip, who during her time in office had never voted against the government, spoke of the need for discussion over Brown's position. McDonagh was sacked from her role shortly afterwards, on 12 September. Whilst McDonagh did not state that she wanted Brown deposed, she implored the Labour party to hold a leadership election, she was sacked from her role shortly afterwards. McDonagh was supported by Joan Ryan (who applied, as McDonagh had, for leadership nomination papers, and became the second rebel to be fired from her job), Jim Dowd, Greg Pope, and a string of others who had previously held positions in government, made clear their desire for a contest.|$|E
25|$|Giolitti {{called for}} new {{elections}} in May 1921, but his list obtained only 19.1% of votes {{and a total}} of 105 MPs. The disappointing results forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> down.|$|E
25|$|Bright {{was injured}} {{towards the end}} of the 1986–87 season. He led the Victorian team to the Sheffield Shield final, but they lost to Western Australia. His {{shoulder}} injury called <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> down as Victorian captain at the end of the summer. He had a solid season, with 29 wickets at 31.41.|$|E

25|$|Gilles Duceppe {{announced}} on 11 May 2007 {{that he would}} run for {{the leadership of the}} Parti Québécois to replace André Boisclair, who resigned on 8 May 2007, after the poor performance in the March 2007 Quebec provincial election and internal dissent forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> down. Duceppe announced the next day that he was withdrawing from the race, and that he would support Pauline Marois who had also announced her intention to run.|$|E
25|$|After {{escalating}} demonstrations {{challenged the}} long-standing strong-man rule of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Obama and many European leaders called for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> {{down and he}} did so in 2011. The Egyptians elected a new government based on the Muslim Brotherhood. However the new President Mohamed Morsi was overthrown in 2013 by the military. President Obama noted that the crisis in Egypt is deplorable and tragic; the situations {{at the end of}} 2013 remained very tense.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Pawlenty {{wanted to}} run for governor, but party leaders {{made it clear they}} favored {{businessman}} Brian Sullivan. Pawlenty then decided on the U.S. Senate, but he abandoned those plans when Vice President Dick Cheney asked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> aside and allow former St. Paul mayor Norm Coleman to challenge Senator Paul Wellstone without Republican primary opposition. Pawlenty returned to his original ambition and won a hard-fought and narrow victory over Sullivan in the Republican party primary election.|$|E

60|$|As {{he looked}} at the {{sleeping}} monsters near him he determined that the only solution of his problem was to take them all with him. Number Twelve lay closest <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>stepping</b> <b>to</b> his side he nudged him with the butt of the bull whip he still carried. The creature opened his dull eyes.|$|R

25|$|Abdullah faced a {{political}} crisis {{not only from}} the onslaught of the Opposition which gained much ground by taking the richest and most important states (Selangor and Penang, which incidentally is the hometown of Abdullah Badawi). He also faced growing discontent from within his own ranks in the UMNO party. Mukhriz Mahathir, the son of the former premier, openly called for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> down. The UMNO Youth chief, Hishammuddin, did not take any action against Mukhriz and dismissed it as a personal opinion.|$|E
25|$|Chappell's first {{overseas}} tour as {{the coach}} of the Indian team was to Zimbabwe in September 2005. Sourav Ganguly, the Indian captain, scored a century in the first Test match and later alleged that the coach Chappell had asked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> down as captain {{on the eve of the}} game. This was widely covered by the Indian media. Ganguly was later dropped from the Indian cricket team by the selectors on the grounds of poor form, but many in the media suggested his omission was influenced by the previous row with Chappell.|$|E
25|$|Lim's Singapore People's Alliance (SPA) was {{defeated}} by the PAP in the 1959 election, causing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> down as Chief Minister, while Lee succeeded him as Prime Minister. Since then, he was less involved in Singaporean politics and left the Assembly in 1963. He was appointed Malaysian High Commissioner in Australia by the then-Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman. However, {{he dropped out of}} Malaysian politics in advance due to his disappearance in 1966 during his term of office. Lim converted to Islam and led a low profile in Saudi Arabia in his late years.|$|E
60|$|Steady! Would not {{the best}} thing for <b>him</b> be <b>to</b> <b>step</b> down <b>to</b> Waterloo Bridge and throw himself over? He still had money enough left to pay the toll--though not enough to hire a pistol. And so he went home and got into bed.|$|R

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, {{it appears}} that Ross fell out with King James. On 29 May 1591, James wrote to Mure of Caldwell, {{requesting}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> use his influence with Ross <b>to</b> bring <b>him</b> <b>to</b> heel. Mure's good offices proved insufficient and, on 30 September 1591, James wrote to Lord Hamilton <b>to</b> inform <b>him</b> that Ross remained in rebellion and <b>to</b> direct <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take <b>steps</b> <b>to</b> bring Ross to justice.|$|R
25|$|On 26 March he {{accompanied}} LaRouche {{members to}} Frankfurt {{to hand out}} LaRouche literature in the streets, then to see the Rembrandt collection at the Städel museum. When one member asked {{what he thought of}} it, he started crying. The woman invited <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> outside for some air. He kept repeating that he did not trust LaRouche, and said he {{wanted to go back to}} England. She told him he was free to leave and could phone her if he wanted to, which seemed to reassure him. She last saw him with one of his roommates sitting on the steps of the museum around 8:30pm.|$|E
25|$|In January 2010 Mikio Aoki, who was 76 {{years of}} age, {{expressed}} {{his intention to}} seek a fifth six-year term in the House of Councillors at the election {{to be held in}} the middle of the year. He received official LDP backing from party leader Sadakazu Tanigaki, despite some people within the party wanting for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> aside in favour of a younger candidate. However, Mikio suffered a stroke on 13 May 2010 while campaigning in Unnan city and informed LDP officials in Shimane the following day that he would have to abandon his campaign. At this time Kazuhiko's name was immediately raised as a replacement, and he later received the official nomination to contest the Shimane district at the July 2010 election. In the election he received 52.9% of the vote in a four-candidate contest.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the referendum result, Miliband said that although he had publicly supported Jeremy Corbyn since his election as leader, he had [...] "reluctantly reached the conclusion [...] position [...] untenable", calling for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> down in June 2016. In the ensuing contest, Miliband supported leadership challenger Owen Smith. In September 2016, Miliband joined the editorial board of The Political Quarterly journal, an unremunerated role.|$|E
50|$|Bouncing Boy {{lost his}} powers {{for a short}} period of time after he accidentally bounced into a matter-shrinking facility. This caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> lose his ability to expand, which {{resulted}} in <b>him</b> having <b>to</b> <b>step</b> down from the Legion of Super-Heroes. He later regained his powers after the formula which originally gave him his powers was recreated for him in Adventure #351 (1966). He then re-joined the Legion of Super-Heroes.|$|R

60|$|Leo stood nearest to her, and {{the sight}} of this royal woman in her misery proved too much for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> bear. <b>Stepping</b> <b>to</b> her side he stooped and lifted her to her feet, muttering some kind words. For a moment she rested on his arm, then shook herself free of him and took the proffered hand of her old uncle Simbri.|$|R
500|$|When asked {{towards the}} end of his career whether he had been stung by the {{criticism}} he had received, Stevenson replied [...] "A lot of my colleagues are just constipated Methodists". There was no compulsory retirement age for a judge with Stevenson's length of service, which resulted in some speculation following the announcement of his retirement from the bench in 1979 that perhaps his unpopularity with certain sections of the media and establishment had led to pressure on <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> down.|$|E
500|$|The next day, Evan lets Neal {{know that}} Woods {{suspects}} something.

500|$|Swedien and Jones {{stated that}} Vincent Price {{recorded}} his introduction and voice-over rap {{for the song}} in two takes; Jones, acknowledging that doing a voice-over for a song is [...] "difficult", praised Price and described his recording takes as being [...] "fabulous". Swedien said of Jackson recording the song, that, [...] "I tried {{all sorts of things}} with Michael – for instance, he would sing the main vocal part and we'd double it one time and then I'd ask <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> away from the mic and do it a third time and that really changed the acoustics in the room so it gave Michael's vocals a unique character … We recorded some of those background vocals in the shower stall at Westlake." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1904, the NFCWC petitioned President Franklin D. Roosevelt <b>to</b> urge <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take <b>steps</b> against lynching.
