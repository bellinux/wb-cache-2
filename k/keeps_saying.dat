500|$|After {{the end of}} the SpongeBob special, Patchy finds Encino {{shrunk to}} a very small size, and then, he finds three aliens, which explain that their son, Norbluck 5, was playing with his Shrink-A-Tron again. Patchy yells at them that he wants his town back in full size, and he <b>keeps</b> <b>saying,</b> “There’s no place like home." [...] (Obviously parodying the scene from The Wizard of Oz) Sympathetic by Patchy's misery that he wants to go home because he missed it the entire story, Norbluck 5's mother gets the Shrink-A-Tron given from her son, and she presses the big red button control, making a tornado {{disaster}} to fix it up. Then, Patchy is glad to be back in Encino, but soon, a giant Potty the Parrot crushes him into the house (presumably showing that Norbluck 5 had once again used his Shrink-A-Tron to make Potty huge).|$|E

He traveled to farms all over Japan to learn the business and planned to bring his innovative style to farming as well - with a little pushing: [...] "Everybody who works for me is an idiot, who <b>keeps</b> <b>saying</b> how things can't be done instead of using their heads and trying to work out the ways things can be done".|$|E
2500|$|Talking to What's on TV, Wallace {{commented on}} Kat's reunion with Alfie. She said: [...] "She punches him! Alfie has {{come looking for}} her and hasn't seen her for months. He <b>keeps</b> <b>saying</b> to her 'You're fat' and she says 'I'm not fat. I'm pregnant!' Then she says, 'Don't worry Alfie, it ain't yours'. She's peed off with him. He's been in prison and she's had to survive on her own pregnant. But she loves him unconditionally. No matter what they do, they will always end up together. She wants stability... a future for the baby and her. She sets him this {{challenge}} and he buys it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 8, 2013, Gambino {{released}} a teaser video for the album, which he announced as being titled Because the Internet {{and that it}} would be released in December 2013. Gambino told MTV that singer Beck gave him the idea for the album title. He explained the title, saying: [...] "Because the internet I'm here, because of the internet we're all here. It's the language of earth. Everyone <b>keeps</b> <b>saying</b> by this or that year, Mandarin or Spanish will be the most dominant language, but the internet is already a language we are all connected to; even my dad can understand the meme format.

2500|$|On 1 January 2007, Langer {{announced}} his retirement from Test cricket after the fifth Ashes Test against England, starting at the Sydney Cricket Ground the following day. [...] In doing so, he joined Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath who had both announced their retirements earlier in the month. [...] Coming only three matches after the surprise departure of Damien Martyn. [...] He came to the decision during the previous match in Melbourne, having earlier decided against retiring after the tour of South Africa to help Australia reclaim the Ashes. [...] He said of his decision: [...] "Everyone <b>keeps</b> <b>saying</b> 'you'll know when it's time'. Well, at one o'clock two days ago I {{knew it was time}} – it just came to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{forensic}} engineering {{team from}} the Louisiana State University, using sonar, showed {{that at one point}} near the 17th Street Canal breach, the piling extends just [...] below sea level, [...] shallower than the Corps of Engineers had maintained. [...] "The Corps <b>keeps</b> <b>saying</b> the piles were 17feet, but their own drawings show them to be 10 feet, Ivor van Heerden said. [...] "This is the first time anyone has been able to get a firm fix on what's really down there. And, so far, it's just 10feet. Not nearly deep enough." [...] The two sets of November tests conducted by the Corps of Engineers and LSU researchers used non-invasive seismic methods. Both studies understated the length of the piles by about seven feet. By December, seven of the actual piles had been pulled from the ground and measured. The Engineering News Record reported on December 16 that they ranged from 23' 3 1/8" [...] to 23' 7 7/16" [...] long, well within the original design specifications, contradicting the early report of short pilings.|$|E
2500|$|Melchior Wańkowicz, {{a popular}} Polish journalist, met Beck {{in the autumn}} of 1939 during his {{internment}} in Romania. This is how he described the meeting: [...] "Beck was locked in a golden cage of a luxurious hotel in Brașov, where he and his entourage occupied one floor. He was closely guarded: whenever he went out, hordes of Allied, German and Romanian agents followed him (...) I met him at 5 in the afternoon, and our conversation continued until almost two in the morning, with a dinner break. Beck emphasized achievements of the last month of his post: a military treaty with England, Hungarian refusal to let German troops pass through their territory, droit de residence and droit de passage, granted by Romanian government. Beck believes in a solid coalition, and that we would sit at a negotiating table as partners, while Czechs would remain outside. He does not care about the fact that Lloyd George stated that Poland did not deserve help as a reactionary country. He is not bothered by the fact that Lord Halifax wants to recreate the Curzon Line. Instead, he points out that when British king gave a speech on the radio, only English, French and Polish anthems were played (...) Since I cannot tolerate this kind of wishful thinking, I ask him whether he had ever seriously considered German attack. He <b>keeps</b> <b>saying</b> that he had met Hitler several times, that Hitler backs out of discussions, that he can easily be talked into different things, that he was influenced by von Ribbentrop." ...|$|E

She was a chronic invalid and morphia was found by her bedside. There was an inquest with an open verdict. Eight days later I went to have a sitting with Mr. Vout Peters. After giving me a good deal which was vague and irrelevant, he suddenly said: [...] "There is a lady here. She is leaning upon an older woman. She <b>keeps</b> <b>saying</b> 'Morphia.' Three times she has said it. Her mind was clouded. She did not mean it. Morphia!" [...] Those were almost his exact words. Telepathy was out of the question, for I had entirely other thoughts in my mind at the time and was expecting no such message.|$|E

And what is curious, and would be unaccountable, I suppose, to English politicians in general, the Italian democrats of the lower classes, the popular clubs in Florence, are clinging to him as their one hope. Ah, here's oppression! here's a people trodden down! You should come here and see. It is enough to turn the depths of the heart bitter. The will of the people forced, their instinctive affections despised, their liberty of thought spied into, their national life ignored altogether.
