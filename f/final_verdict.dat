5|$|The federal jury convicted Cisneros of {{the murder}} on May 12 after three hours of deliberation. The {{prosecution}} introduced witnesses, including the motel manager and those at the crime scene, who stated that they saw a white car driven by the suspected assassins coming from Mexico {{the day before the}} shooting. The defense told the jurors that there was not enough evidence to uphold the conviction under federal requirements of reasonable doubt. The government concluded that it met the burden of proof for interstate or foreign commerce charges in two ways: through Garza's phone calls from Mexico, and through the matching license plates of the Mexican car that crossed into the U.S. and registered at the motel, which matched the description of the vehicle seen at the murder scene. In order to find Cisneros guilty, they were not required to prove that she intended to use interstate or foreign commerce, or even that she knew it would be used. They were required to prove that someone involved in Fischer's murder used interstate or foreign commerce or caused another person to use it. On July 27, the jury rendered their <b>final</b> <b>verdict</b> and sentenced Cisneros to life in prison. Two years later, the United States Attorney Office recognized two local police officers and three FBI agents for assisting in her prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Days {{after the}} 2011 {{parliamentary}} elections in early December 2011, {{it was suggested}} by Vesna Pusić– already recognized as the future Minister of Foreign and European Affairs– that the referendum should be postponed until March 2012 to allow better preparation for the poll. The suggestion was soon followed by a similar request made by GONG that the referendum be postponed until mid-February or later; its request was also supported by five major trade unions. GONG's request was made {{because of what they}} stated to be: poor information provided to citizens; undefined procedures for voter registration away from a voter's permanent residence; unclear directions for voting abroad; no legal provisions specifically defining the composition of ballot counting commissions; no provisions for referendum vote monitoring by partisan, non-partisan and foreign monitors; no legal provisions regarding referendum funding (since the 2011 state budget did not appropriate any funds to cover referendum expenses); no legal provisions funding the pro-referendum campaign or allowing the campaign itself; and the lack of restrictions against campaigning {{on the day of the}} referendum. The union support for this request was due to the government's ultimately not putting forward the other referendum (altering the conditions for referendums from citizens by changing the number of petitioners required and the time allowed to gather their signatures), which they had earlier agreed to do. Another request to postpone the election was made by more than a thousand signatories of a petition to the government, demanding that the referendum be postponed until after the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) returned the <b>final</b> <b>verdict</b> in the case against generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač. They cited concerns over EU support for the ICTY, which they describe as biased; they therefore questioned if the EU favoured some nations over others.|$|E

40|$|Background: The author {{analyzed}} the anesthesia medical malpractice closed claims that {{were referred to}} the Legal Health Organization (LHO) in order to evaluate the magnitude and underlying factors {{of the problem in}} Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: Annual reports covering the period from 1420 H- 1429 H (1999 - 2008) were statistically analyzed to give mean figures and percentages in each annual report, and then demonstrated all together to run the differential analysis together with the trend along the studied period. Results: Data analysis showed an escalating trend for the total number of claims over the study period being started with 440 cases on 1420 H and ended with 1356 cases by the year 1429 H. The annual percentage of the <b>final</b> <b>verdicts</b> of accusation to the total number of claims presented to all committees ranges between 45. 5 &#x 0025;&# 8722; 60. 2 &#x 0025; with a mean value of 49. 9 &#x 0025;. Distribution of <b>final</b> <b>verdicts</b> among different clinical specialities showed that obstetrics takes the lead with a mean percentage of 25. 5 &#x 0025; along the studied period (1420 H- 1429 H), followed by the practice of general surgery with a mean percentage of 13. 8 &#x 0025;. The sector of health care service showed a significant variation in relation to the mean number of <b>final</b> <b>verdicts</b> with accusation along the studied period, being the highest in the Ministry of Health sector with a mean number of 216. 8 claims, followed by the private sector with a mean number of 197. 3 claims.

50|$|On 29 April 2014, five convicts were {{executed}} after Luo {{gave the order}} {{to carry out the}} death sentences the day before, the first order since Luo took office as Minister of Justice in September 2013.

They were divided on the issue: two found signs of extremism in the text and one did not. Following a plea by ISKCON advocate Mikhail Fralov to seek a statement of the Russian Human Rights Committee on the Bhagavad Gita As It Is and on the right of religious minorities, the Judge agreed to hear their opinion and postponed the <b>final</b> <b>verdict</b> until December 28, 2011.|$|E

25|$|The {{organisation}} of the Judiciary {{that the}} Dutch Republic {{inherited from the}} Habsburg Netherlands was a patchwork of city and feudal courts on a local level, applying local law, like Schepenbanken, Baljuw's courts, and Heerlijkheid's courts that acted as courts of first instance in both criminal and civil cases. In general, appeal from criminal verdicts was not possible, so that the Apellate courts only took appeals of civil cases. The provincial High Court (the Hof van Holland) took these appeals, but also acted as court of first instance {{in a number of}} cases. The Supreme Court of Holland and Zeeland provided a possibility of (higher) appeal from cases decided in the provincial high court and the courts of the Hoogheemraadschappen (which handled certain land-use cases). It also had original jurisdiction in certain cases, e.g. commercial cases involving foreign merchants (and foreign law). Cases of Reversal (i.e. in which a <b>final</b> <b>verdict</b> was reviewed and possibly overturned) were reserved for the States-General which as Hoge Overheid or sovereign power in the Republic was the ultimate fount of justice (the States-General exceptionally also took politically sensitive cases, like the trial of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt and Hugo Grotius in 1618 and the trial of the Amboyna judges).|$|E

The respective probability of these alternatives was varied, as was their association with the alleged crime. When the probability of the alternatives was varied between subjects (Experiment 1) there was only weak evidence that jurors considered both alternatives. When probability was varied within-subjects (Experiment 2), jurors did consider both alternatives in their guilt judgments.
