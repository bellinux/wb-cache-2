5|$|Badmotorfinger was Soundgarden's {{first album}} with bassist Ben Shepherd, {{who joined the}} group in April 1990. Shepherd {{replaced}} previous bassist Jason Everman. The album was recorded {{in the spring of}} 1991 at Studio D in Sausalito, California, Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville, Washington, and A Studios in Los Angeles, California. Soundgarden chose to work with producer Terry Date again as it had on its previous release Louder Than Love (1989). Frontman Chris Cornell said the band decided to work with Date again seeing as the band had a good relationship with him and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through the pressure of trying to find a new producer.|$|E

25|$|When Titanic sank at 2:20a.m., Boxhall {{suggested}} to the occupants {{that they should}} go back to pick people up from the water. However, they refused outright. Boxhall found this puzzling, as only a short time before the women had pleaded with Smith for their husbands to be allowed to accompany them, yet now they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to save them (although actually only one woman, Mrs. Walter Douglas, had left a husband on board).

(RB.207). The A.T.E family introduced new scalable technologies such as the triple shaft architecture, a high pressure annular combustor and a structurally integrated power-plant (nacelle).|$|E

25|$|In June 1846, Frémont and Carson both {{participated in}} a California {{uprising}} against Mexico called the Bear Flag Revolt. Mexico ordered all Americans to leave California. They <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> and declared California an independent republic. American settlers in California wanted {{to be free of}} the Mexican government. The Americans found courage to oppose Mexico because they had Frémont and his troops behind them. Frémont wrote an oath of allegiance. He and his men were able to give some protection to the Americans. He ordered Carson to execute an old Mexican man named Jose De La Reyes Berryessa and his two adult nephews. These three were captured when they stepped ashore at San Francisco Bay. They were executed to keep them from taking reports to Mexico about the uprising.|$|E
25|$|A reanalysis of the AAUW data {{found that}} {{victims of sexual}} {{harassment}} by teachers reported experiencing adverse health effects because of the abuse. 28% {{said that they had}} trouble sleeping and lost their appetite, 51% reported feeling embarrassed, and 37% indicated that they felt less sure of themselves or less confident {{as a result of the}} sexual harassment. Furthermore, 36% of the students said that they were afraid or scared and 29% reported feeling confused about their identity. In addition to negatively affecting health outcomes, teacher sexual abuse influenced the victims' academic performance. The affected students avoided the teacher (43%), they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to school (36%), avoided talking in class (34%), had trouble paying attention (31%), cut classes (29%), or found it hard to study (29%).|$|E
25|$|On January 24, 2006, {{reports from}} NBA sources {{confirmed}} that the Sacramento Kings had agreed to trade Peja Stojaković to the Pacers for Artest. However, before the trade could be completed, many press outlets reported that Artest had informed team management that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Sacramento. According to Artest's agent, his original trade request was only made because he was upset when he heard rumors that the Pacers were going to trade him to Sacramento for Stojaković early in the season. While not denying his agent's story, Artest did deny that he had rejected the trade to Sacramento, saying that he would play anywhere; hence, contradicting earlier press accounts stating Artest was holding up the trade. Given conflicting accounts, it is unclear why the trade was delayed, but it was nevertheless completed on January 25 and Artest was officially sent to the Kings for Stojaković.|$|E

500|$|Dishonored was not {{developed}} with a sequel in mind, but ideas for one {{began to emerge}} during the development of its downloadable content. Harvey Smith called the decision to play as Emily as intuitive at the start, with Emily having been {{a child in the}} original game. The impact that Emily had on players in Dishonored, which changed how the game was being played, made the developer decide to continue her story and give her more depth in Dishonored 2. Although this meant moving the timeline along, Arkane <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> too far for fear of losing the series' gaslamp fantasy / steampunk vibe.

500|$|Despite being a World Cup {{winner in}} the {{previous}} summer, Banks was dropped {{towards the end of}} the 1966–67 season in favour of highly promising teenage reserve Peter Shilton. Manager Matt Gillies was blunt, telling Banks [...] "we [...] think your best days are behind you, and you should move on". Teammate Richie Norman told Banks that Gillies was pressured into the decision, Shilton having told the board he would leave the club unless he was given first team football. Banks was transfer listed at £50,000, the same price the club received for Derek Dougan in March 1967. However, many of the big clubs were unwilling to spend such a sum on a goalkeeper. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly showed strong interest, but could not convince the club's board of directors to agree to such a large fee for a goalkeeper. West Ham United manager Ron Greenwood was prepared to match the fee, but instead signed Kilmarnock's Bobby Ferguson for £65,000 because he had already agreed terms with Kilmarnock and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back on his word. Terms were instead agreed with Stoke City, a mid-table First Division side.|$|E
500|$|On 15 January 2014, {{a series}} of {{intimate}} messages, supposedly sent by the Pakistani journalist Mehr Tarar to Tharoor, were posted on the former's Twitter account. The messages proclaimed Tarar's love for Tharoor. Tarar tried to downplay the incident by stating that her account had been hacked. However, Sunanda later stated that the account had not been hacked {{and that she had}} posted the messages to expose what she believed to be Tara's stalking of her husband. She accused Mehr of being an ISI agent. Later, she stated that she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> public about the matter, especially in an election year. The next day, a note titled as [...] "Joint statement by Sunanda and Shashi Tharoor" [...] was published on Shashi Tharoor's Facebook page. The note stated that the couple was happily married, and that some personal comments not intended for publication had been misrepresented after being posted to Twitter.

She was being treated for Lupus erythematosus, a deadly immune disorder which damages healthy tissues.|$|E
500|$|A rare New Year's Day {{game was}} played against SEC foe Arkansas, who was ranked just inside the top 25. Tennessee forced 26 turnovers, {{including}} 14 steals, en route to an 88–58 victory. This game was followed up with a home match with main rival UConn, who was ranked third in the nation. UConn led the series 4–3, but the Lady Vols had won the last matchup, and the undefeated Huskies wanted revenge. [...] Thompson-Boling Arena seated nearly 25,000 fans, an NCAA women's record, and, as an experiment, the {{game was played}} in four quarters instead of two halves. The Lady Vols started off on a 10–0 run, but the lead was cut to 23–17 {{by the end of}} the first quarter. The second quarter saw Tennessee expand the lead, ending the quarter with a fourteen-point lead. However, UConn <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> away, and went on a tear in the third quarter, as a 20–7 run cut the Lady Vols lead to one point, before the team responded, ending the quarter with seven unanswered points.

500|$|Describing {{his thought}} process towards the material, Vaughn {{said he was}} {{motivated}} by [...] "unfinished business" [...] with Marvel, having been previously involved with the production of both X-Men: The Last Stand and Thor. Vaughn declared {{that he was more}} enthusiastic about First Class than The Last Stand due to not being constrained by the previous installments, and having the opportunity to [...] "start fresh", while [...] "nodding towards" [...] the successful elements from those films. Vaughn compared First Class to both Batman Begins (2005), which restarted a franchise with an unseen approach, and the 2009 Star Trek film, which paid homage to the original source material while taking it in a new direction with a fresh, young cast. Regarding continuity, Vaughn said his intention was [...] "to make as good a film that could stand on its own two feet regardless of all the other films" [...] and also that could [...] "reboot and start a whole new X-Men franchise". Goldman added the film was kind of an [...] "alternate history" [...] for the X-Men, saying that while rebooting, the writers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> fully [...] "against the canon of the X-Men trilogy", comparing to the various approaches the comic had in over fifty years of publication.|$|E

The Panthers won the Public League a third time, beating West Philadelphia 78–60, and in the city championship game, they met West Catholic once again. Scoring 35 points, Chamberlain led Overbrook to an easy 83–42 victory. After three years, Chamberlain had led Overbrook to two city championships, logged a 56–3 record and broken Tom Gola's high school scoring record by scoring 2,252 points, averaging 37.4 points per game. After his last Overbrook season, over 200 universities wanted to recruit the basketball prodigy. Among others, UCLA offered Chamberlain {{the opportunity to become}} a movie star, the University of Pennsylvania wanted to buy him diamonds, and Chamberlain's Panthers coach Mosenson was even offered a coaching position if he could persuade the center. In his 2004 biography of [...] Chamberlain, Robert Cherry has described that Chamberlain wanted a change and therefore <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to or near Philadelphia (also eliminating New York), was not interested in New England, and snubbed the South because of segregation; leaving the Midwest.
