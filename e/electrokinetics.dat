50|$|<b>Electrokinetics</b> remediation, also termed <b>electrokinetics,</b> is a {{technique}} of using direct electric current to remove organic, inorganic and heavy metal particles from the soil by electric potential. The use of this technique provides an approach with minimum disturbance to the surface while treating subsurface contaminants.|$|E
50|$|A major {{limitation}} of <b>electrokinetics</b> {{is the introduction}} of an external fluid into the soil. If the contaminant cannot be dissolved {{it is not possible}} to extract the contaminant of interest. Electrolysis near the electrodes can alter the pH of the soil especially if the current is induced for an extended period of time. Extended use of <b>electrokinetics</b> system can also cause acidic conditions around the electrodes sometimes reacting with contaminants. If increased acidification of the soil is not environmentally acceptable the use of <b>electrokinetics</b> should be reevaluated. Large metal objects that are buried underground also pose as a limitation to electrodes because they offer a path to short circuit the system. Buried metal objects can also change the voltage gradient and decrease or stop the flow. The removal of volatile organic compounds from the soils can increase the soil vapor concentration. Counterintuitively, highly permeable soils lower the efficiency of <b>electrokinetics.</b> Where a low permeable soil like clay can receive up to 90% initial contaminant removal a low permeable soil like peat achieves about 65% removal of initial contaminants.|$|E
50|$|One {{thing to}} note {{is that the}} {{potential}} profile in soils can {{be determined by the}} ionic distribution of pore fluid. Because ion distribution effects the efficiency of the <b>electrokinetics</b> system, engineers like John Dzenitis have done comprehensive study to find key reactions around the electrodes {{that can be used to}} create models for ionic flowrate prediction. These models can then be interpreted to determine if <b>electrokinetics</b> remediation is the best choice for a given site.|$|E

5000|$|Electrokinetic {{remediation}} {{is applied}} to many contaminants that can be dissolved within groundwater. Heavy metals {{are one of the}} main contaminants that are removed by the <b>electrokinetics</b> process. Some metals like cadmium (II) can be removed with high consequences on energy expenditure. Chromium (III) can be removed but with low efficiency because of the ease of hydrolysis allowing it to sorb to other substances. Chromium (IV) is also a candidate for <b>electrokinetics</b> removal although chromium (IV) migration is retarded in the presence of sulfur because it will break down into chromium (III). [...] Other heavy metal species that are tested and reported to be treatable include; mercury, zinc, iron, lead, copper, and magnesium. <b>Electrokinetics</b> is also possible with alkali and alkaline earth metals which travel faster in most mediums than heavy metals. At tests between 20 to 30 volts, alkali metals were known to move between 50 to 60 cm per day per volts whereas heavy metal moved at velocities between 10 and 20 cm per day per volts. It is possible that this difference could be because of the slow desorption and dissolution of heavy metals. <b>Electrokinetics</b> {{can also be used to}} treat polar organic compounds (phenol and acetic acid) and radionucleotides (radium), toxic anions (nitrates and sulfates), dense, non-aqueous-phase liquids (DNAPLs), cyanide, petroleum hydrocarbons (diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene and lubricating oils), halogenated pollutants, explosives, halogenated and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{advantages}} of <b>electrokinetics</b> is that the remediation can be conducted in situ (within the remediation site) to treat contaminants in low permeability zones to overcome accessibility of contaminants or delivery of treatment. Remediation can also occur ex situ (removed from the natural site) to have contaminants tested and treated within a laboratory. This versatility of treatment location can be very cost effective. <b>Electrokinetics</b> has the advantage of use in saturated or unsaturated soils because of the insertion of pore fluid. Remediation can also occur despite soil stratifications or homogeneity. For soils that are low in permeability like kaolite and clayey sands it is possible to remove up to 90% of heavy metal contaminants. In many cases pretreatment of soil should be made to determine appropriate working conditions of the soil.|$|E

50|$|In 1958 Brown {{worked as}} a {{research}} and development consultant for Agnew Bahnson's Whitehall Rand Project, an anti-gravity venture at the Bahnson Company of Winston-Salem, North Carolina. That same year Brown setup his own anti-gravity corporation, Rand International Limited. He filed several patents but his ideas met with little success. In the early 1960s he {{worked as a}} physicist for <b>Electrokinetics</b> Inc., of Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. and then went into semi-retirement, living in California.

50|$|Electrohydro{{dynamics}} (EHD), {{also known}} as electro-fluid-dynamics (EFD) or <b>electrokinetics,</b> {{is the study of}} the dynamics of electrically charged fluids. It is the study of the motions of ionized particles or molecules and their interactions with electric fields and the surrounding fluid. The term may be considered to be synonymous with the rather elaborate electrostrictive hydrodynamics. ESHD covers the following types of particle and fluid transport mechanisms: electrophoresis, electrokinesis, dielectrophoresis, electro-osmosis, and electrorotation. In general, the phenomena relate to the direct conversion of electrical energy into kinetic energy, and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|Fluid {{mechanics}} {{are primarily}} affected by pressure, temperature, heat transfer, and <b>electrokinetics.</b> An {{increase in pressure}} increases the flow rate given by the Starling equation. An increase in temperature increases the wettability of the surface, promoting fluid flow. Heat also decreases the viscosity of the lumen. Heat transfer is monitored by thermoreceptors which regulate the amount of capillary beds open for heat dissipation. The surface chemistry of the endothelial cell lining also dictates fluid flow. A charged surface will acquire a layer of stagnant diffuse ions that hinder the flow of ions in the lumen. This decreases the lumen velocity and promotes the exchange of molecules through the capillary lining.|$|E
50|$|At one time, Brown {{believed}} his devices produced {{a new field}} that interacted with the Earth's gravitational pull, a phenomenon he labeled electrogravitics. Several researchers claim that conventional physics cannot adequately explain the phenomenon. The effect {{has become something of}} a cause célèbre in the UFO community, where it is seen as an example of something much more exotic than <b>electrokinetics.</b> Charles Berlitz devoted an entire chapter of his book The Philadelphia Experiment to a retelling of Brown's early work with the effect, implying he had discovered a new electrogravity effect and that it was being used by UFOs. Today, the Internet is filled with sites devoted to this interpretation of the effect.|$|E
5000|$|The shown <b>electrokinetics</b> theorem {{holds true}} in the 'quasi electrostatic' condition, {{that is when}} the vector {{potential}} can be neglected or, in other terms, when the squared maximum size of [...] is {{much smaller than the}} squared minimum wavelength of the electromagnetic field in the device. However it can be extended to the electromagnetic field in a general form. In this general case, by means of the displacement current across the surface [...] it is possible, for instance, to evaluate the electromagnetic field radiation from an antenna. It holds true also when the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability depend on the frequency. Moreover, the field [...] other than the electric field in 'quasi electrostatic' conditions, can be any other physical irrotational field.|$|E
5000|$|In {{many cases}} the study of {{specific}} site occurrences with <b>electrokinetics</b> remediation can lead to new advancements in the technology. Many times <b>electrokinetics</b> remediation will be coupled with other remediation forms to handle site specific issues. At a Danish Wood Perseveration copper was a heavy metal that polluted the soil in two forms; ionic solution with different complexes within the soil or a crystal lattice of soil minerals. For this site soil pH was a parameter of great importance because of an increased amount of copper present as ionic solution. By creating active barriers or exchange membranes that prevent ions from traveling from the electrode compartment into the soil. The separation of the soil from the electrode is designed to deter the acidification of the cathode and the current loss as highly mobile ions pass from electrode site through the soil. [...] In 1995 at the Paducah site, in Kentucky, USA a new technique was developed for removing heavy metals from soils. Called the Lasagna Process, it simply {{is the creation of}} several horizontal permeable zones used to provide treatment through the contaminated soil matrix by adding different admixtures to the electrolytic solution. Admixtures like sorbents, catalytic reagents, buffering solutions, oxidizing agents in this system are applied through a vertical system with the anode near the bottom and the cathode near the top. [...] The orientation of vertical anode and cathode system make recycling of fluid and system treatment easier. The formation of the lasagna layers is due to fracturing in over-consolidated clays because of horizontal electrodes. Coupling of the horizontal electrodes with a vertical pressuring system make this method especially effective in removing contaminants from deeper layers of the soil. The first test of this process proved 98% effective of removing trichloroethylene from the Paducah site.|$|E
5000|$|The octree level set method, {{introduced}} by Strain in 1999 and refined by Losasso, Gibou and Fedkiw, {{and more recently}} by Min and Gibou uses a tree of nested cubes of which the leaf nodes contain signed distance values.

This representation is efficient in terms of storage, [...] and relatively efficient in terms of access queries, [...] An advantage of the level method on octree data structures is that one can solve the partial differential equations associated with typical free boundary problems that use the level set method. The CASL research group has developed this line of work in computational materials, computational fluid dynamics, <b>electrokinetics,</b> image guided surgery and controls.|$|E
5000|$|Another major {{limitation}} of the <b>electrokinetics</b> process is the decrease the electric potential of the system. Different polarization effects can decrease how the system runs. For instance:Activation polarization can occur during the electrokinetic remediation process removing gas bubbles that form {{on the surface of}} the electrodes during conductivity. Resistance polarization can occur after the electrokinetic remediation process has started a white layer can be observed. Just like in hard water stains this layer may be the insoluble salt and other impurities that inhibit conductivity. Concentration polarization happens when hydrogen ions generated at the anode are attracted to the cathode and the hydroxide ions generated at the cathode are attracted to the anode. If neutralization occurs the potential between the system drops. [...] Local flattening of the electrical potential profile can also cause the difference in migration.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electrokinetics</b> {{have been}} {{exploited}} in bio-MEMS for separating mixtures of molecules and cells using electrical fields. In electrophoresis, a charged species in a liquid moves {{under the influence}} of an applied electric field. Electrophoresis has been used to fractionate small ions, charged organic molecules, proteins, and DNA. Electrophoresis and microfluidics are highly synergistic because it is possible to use higher voltages in microchannels due to faster heat removal. Isoelectric focusing is the separation of proteins, organelles, and cells with different isoelectric points. Isoelectric focusing requires a pH gradient (usually generated with electrodes) perpendicular to the flow direction. Sorting and focusing of the species of interest is achieved because an electrophoretic force causes perpendicular migration until it flows along its respective isoelectric points. Dielectrophoresis is the motion of uncharged particles due to induced polarization from nonuniform electric fields. Dielectrophoresis can be used in bio-MEMS for dielectrophoresis traps, concentrating specific particles at specific points on surfaces, and diverting particles from one flow stream to another for dynamic concentration.|$|E
5000|$|A basic <b>electrokinetics</b> {{remediation}} site {{contains an}} external direct current source, a positively charged electrode (or anode) and a negatively charged electrode (or a cathode) placed into the ground. Placement of electrodes {{are based on}} {{size and shape of}} known contaminant plumes. The removal of contaminants and prevention of plume migration are big influences in determining the arrangement of electrodes. Each electrode is encased in a reservoir well in which an electrolytic solution can be injected. The electrolytic solutions serve both as a conducting media (or pore fluid) and as a means to extract contaminants and introduce chemicals or biological entities. [...] Another use of the electrolytic solution is for control and/or depolarization of electrode reactions. Immersed in a solution the electrodes can result in oxidation at the anode site and the reduction at the cathodic site. [...] The oxidation and formation of an acidic front are by products of the process and cause varying degree of influence to the system. By pumping, processing and testing the electrolytic solution at each electrode site you can extend the life and efficiency of the system.|$|E
5000|$|Electrogravitics {{has become}} popular with UFO, anti-gravity, and {{government}} conspiracy theorists {{where it is}} seen as an example of something much more exotic than <b>electrokinetics,</b> i.e. that electrogravitics is a true anti-gravity technology that can [...] "create a force that depends upon an object’s mass, even as gravity does". There are claims that all major aerospace companies in the 1950s including Martin, Convair, Lear, Sperry, Raytheon were working on it, that the technology became highly classified in the early 1960s, that it is used to power the B-2 bomber, and that {{it can be used to}} generate [...] "free energy". Charles Berlitz devoted an entire chapter of his book on The Philadelphia Experiment (The Philadelphia Experiment: Project Invisibility) to a retelling of Brown's early work with the effect, implying the electrogravitics effect was being used by UFOs. The researcher and author Paul LaViolette has produced many self-published books on electrogravitics, making many claims over the years including his view that the technology could have helped to avoid another Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.|$|E
50|$|When {{current is}} applied, by the direct power source, to the electrodes, {{migration}}s occur beneath the soil surface. Although {{there are many}} types of migrations that occur {{in tandem with the}} current there are two driving migrations within electrokinetics; ionic migration and electrophoresis. When the electrolytic solution is injected within the soil part of the ionic solution forms a diffuse double layer with soils and contaminants. This diffused double layer will aid in the ionic drift that will occur as the current passes though the soil and surrounding liquid, this process is called electroosmosis. The thickness of the diffused double layer is a function of ionic composition of bulk solution and the average charge density of hydration products. As the electrolyte concentration increases the diffuse double layer thickness decreases.Electrophoresis is the mass flux of charged particles under an electric field. Both processes work at the same time but in a counter current manner. The charged particles driven by electrophoresis flow from the cathode to the anode while electrolytic solution flows from the anode to the cathode. Of the two main processes electrophoresis (or electromigration) is more dominant than electroosmosis. Electrophoresis servies as the driving factor that induces the flow of electroosmosis in the opposite direction. Electromigration also serves as the major component for ionic contaminant removal. For electromigration to occur absorbed material must be dissolved to an ionic form whether they are metals, organic or inorganic particles. Electroosmotic flow between the electrodes promotes the development of a low-pH environment in the soil. This low pH environment inhibits metallic contaminants from being sorbed onto soil particle surfaces which aids in the formation of compounds making <b>electrokinetics</b> possible. By this thought it is possible to acidify the soil and induce the release of absorbed heavy metals.|$|E
50|$|Induced-charge <b>electrokinetics</b> {{in physics}} is the {{electrically}} driven fluid flow and particle motion in a liquid electrolyte. Consider a metal particle (which is neutrally charged but electrically conducting) {{in contact with}} an aqueous solution in a chamber/channel. If different voltages apply {{to the end of}} this chamber/channel, electric field will generate in this chamber/channel. This applied electric field passes through this metal particle and causes the free charges inside the particle migrate under the skin of particle. As a result of this migration, the negative charges moves to the side which is close to the positive (or higher) voltage while the positive charges moves to {{the opposite side of the}} particle. These charges under the skin of conducting particle attract the counter-ions of the aqueous solution; thus, the electric double layer (EDL) forms around the particle. The EDL sing on the surface of the conducting particle changes from positive to negative and the distribution of the charges varies along the particle geometry. Due to these variations, the EDL is non-uniform and has different sings. Thus, the induced zeta potential around the particle, and consequently slip velocity on the surface of the particle, vary as a function of local electric field. Differences in magnitude and direction of slip velocity on the surface of the conducting particle effects the flow pattern around this particle and causes micro vortices. Yasaman Daghighi and Dongqing Li, for the first time, experimentally illustrated these induced vortices around a 1.2mm diameter carbon-steel sphere under the 40V/cm Direct Current (DC) external electric filed.Chenhui Peng et al. also experimentally showed the patterns of electro-osmotic flow around an Au sphere when Alternative Current (AC) is involved (E=10mV/μm, f=1 kHz).Electrokinetics here refers to a branch of science related to the motion and reaction of charged particles to the applied electric filed and its effects on its environment. It is sometimes referred as non-linear electrokinetic phenomena as well.|$|E
