40|$|BACKGROUND: Bilateral vasectomy is {{the most}} {{effective}} method of male contraception but there are still some reports on its failure. This study was undertaken to determine the failure rate of the no-scalpel vasectomy in Shiraz Vasectomy Center, Southern Iran. &# 13; METHODS: From 2001 to 2003, 3900 no-scalpel vasectomies were done in Nader Kazemi Health Center. The records were studied for any failure in the method. Presence of any live sperm 6 months after surgery or any report of pregnancy post-vasectomy were considered as vasectomy failure. &# 13; RESULTS:Among 3900 cases, 2928 patients had a complete <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> <b>file</b> while failure in the method was visible among 109 (3. 72 %) cases. &# 13; CONCLUSION: The low failure rate of no-scalpel method indicated its high efficacy to control the fertility in males but there is still need of performance by expert surgeons in well organized centers. &# 13; KEYWORDS: Iran, no-scalpel vasectomy, failure rate...|$|E

The GRADE profile shows that evidence of this meta-analysis is of low quality for in-hospital mortality and of low or very low quality for renal outcomes, as seen in Additional file 1 : Figure S 2, suggesting further studies might be needed to reach a solid conclusion.|$|R
25|$|Carter {{nonetheless}} began {{a personal}} program of gradual manumission of slaves on his many estates. He announced his plan on August 1, 1791, {{and began a}} new legal process by recording a Deed of Gift in Northumberland County on September 5, 1791. Since the manumission law required a five shilling fee, and Carter had plantations and slaves in several Virginia counties, he corresponded with the Westmoreland County clerk (where he resided) and <b>followed</b> <b>up</b> by <b>filing</b> manumission papers at the Westmoreland County court sessions the following February, May, July and August, despite resistance of his son-in-law John Peck, various overseers and tenants. Carter designed the gradual program to reduce the opposition of slave-owning white neighbors, but failed. He refused tenants' requests to relocate slave breeding women to circumvent the Deed of Gift. That winter Carter was shunned, although he sought help from fellow slavery opponents including George Mason (who declined to help and cited his own age and infirmity). By the filings of February 27, 1793, Carter was ahead of his own planned schedule. Moreover, he refused to relocate freed blacks, and began offering them wages, as well as grants and tenancies, sometimes dispossessing obstreperous white tenants. Carter began investigating relocating to the District of Columbia, and leased Nomony plantation and its servants to his son J.T. on April 26, 1793 (expressly conditional to the Deed of Gift).|$|R
5000|$|On April 6, 2010, Daniel E. Petersen {{was sentenced}} to {{additional}} time for filing bogus liens from prison against three federal judges. One of the judges targeted was the judge who sentenced Petersen to prison originally. Petersen was sentenced in 1996 to 15 years. He was convicted on 19 of 20 counts, which included bank fraud and armed robbery. While serving his sentence in a federal prison in Minnesota, Petersen devised a scheme in which to retaliate against three judges in his case. Federal prosecutors, after investigating, found that Petersen invented a company that supposedly held assets that included a $100 trillion default judgment against the United States. He then sold “shares" [...] of the phony company to fellow inmates and others. He claimed these shares were backed by “redemption certificates" [...] to be redeemed when the judgment was collected. The judgment he referred to came from a self-created court, after former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declined to respond to his demands. He was demanding $100 trillion, as well as $1 billion per day in interest for unlawfully confining him. Petersen <b>followed</b> <b>up</b> by <b>filing</b> liens against property owned by the three federal judges, as well as offering bounties for the arrest of the same judges. The purpose was to entice someone to bring the three judges to Minnesota, in order to respond to his liens.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of a register of employees exposed to carcinogens (the ASA Register) which has been in operation in Finland since 1979, and to study cancer risks among the notified workers. Methods: The im-pact of ASA at workplaces was studied by questionnaires mailed to 1448 work departments, which were notified to ASA in 1996, and to 1033 departments, which departed ASA in 1991 – 1996. The mailing was responded by 69 % of departments. The cancer incidence of 35 138 workers notified to ASA in 1979 – 1988 was <b>followed</b> <b>up</b> through the <b>files</b> of the Finnish Cancer Register for the period 1980 – 2003. Results: Changes eliminating or substantially reducing exposure to carcinogens were reported by 73 % of departments notified to ASA in 1996. The ASA notification process had directly prompted measures to reduce exposure (8 % of cases) or contributed to them (24 % of cases). Estimations based on responses of the workplaces sug-gested that the ASA registration had decreased exposure of 600 workers year 21 (out of 15 000 notified workers, which is < 1 % of the employed in Finland), preventing thereby an unknown number of occupational cancers. Other benefits of ASA included the saving of the treatment costs of prevented cancers, the prevention of other health outcomes of carcinogens, improve...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine whether}} {{reactions}} of blood pressure to psychological stress predict future blood pressure. DESIGN [...] Blood pressure was recorded at a medical screening examination after which pressor reactions to a psychological stress task were determined. <b>Follow</b> <b>up</b> measurement of {{blood pressure was}} undertaken, on average, 4. 9 years later. SETTING [...] 20 civil service departments in London. SUBJECTS [...] 1003 male civil servants aged between 35 and 55 years at entry to the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Blood pressure at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> screening. RESULTS [...] Reactions of systolic blood pressure to stress correlated positively with systolic blood pressure at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> screening (r = 0. 22, P < 0. 01). The dominant correlate of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> blood pressure was blood pressure at initial screening (r = 0. 60; P < 0. 01 between initial and <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> systolic blood pressure; r = 0. 59, P < 0. 01 between initial and <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> diastolic blood pressure). Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that reactions to the stressor provided minimal prediction of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> blood pressure over and above that afforded by blood pressure at initial screening. In the case of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> systolic blood pressure, systolic reactions to stress accounted for only 1 % of <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> variance; systolic blood pressure at initial screening accounted for 34 %. With regard to diastolic blood pressure at <b>follow</b> <b>up,</b> the independent contribution from diastolic reactions to stress was less than 1 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the relation of}} cardiac autoantibody and disease status in a consecutive series of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy by prospective antibody testing at diagnosis and at <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> METHODS: Antibody status was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence in 110 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (85 male, mean (SD) age 44 (13) years) at diagnosis and at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> (mean (SD) 14 (12) months); in 57 of them cardiac specific anti-alpha myosin antibody titres were also measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients underwent complete evaluation at diagnosis and clinical and non-invasive assessment at <b>follow</b> <b>up,</b> including exercise testing with maximal oxygen consumption measurements. RESULTS: The frequency of cardiac specific antibodies by immunofluorescence was lower at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> than at diagnosis (28 (25 %) v 11 (10 %), P = 0. 002). Mean (SEM) anti-alpha myosin antibody titres at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> were also lower than at diagnosis (0. 24 (0. 02) v 0. 30 (0. 02), P = 0. 038); 24 % of patients at diagnosis and 14 % at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> had an abnormal ELISA result. None of the patients who were negative by immunofluorescence or ELISA at diagnosis became positive at <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> Presence of antibody at diagnosis was associated with milder symptoms and greater exercise capacity at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> and persistence of antibody at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> was associated with stable disease and milder symptoms at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac specific autoantibodies in dilated cardiomyopathy become undetectable with disease progression; this is a recognised feature of other autoimmune conditions, such as type 1 diabetes. Detection of these antibodies at diagnosis and at <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> may provide a non-invasive marker of early dilated cardiomyopathy...|$|R
