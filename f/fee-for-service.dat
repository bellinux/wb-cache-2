25|$|A {{key project}} {{is one that}} could radically {{change the way the}} medical {{profession}} is paid for services under Medicare and Medicaid. The current system, which is also the prime system used by medical insurers is known as <b>fee-for-service</b> because the medical practitioner is paid only for the performance of medical procedures which, it is argued means that doctors have a financial incentive to do more tests (which generates more income) which may not be in the patients' best long-term interest. The current system encourages medical interventions such as surgeries and prescribed medicines (all of which carry some risk for the patient but increase revenues for the medical care industry) and does not reward other activities such as encouraging behavioral changes such as modifying dietary habits and quitting smoking, or follow-ups regarding prescribed regimes which could have better outcomes for the patient at a lower cost. The current <b>fee-for-service</b> system also rewards bad hospitals for bad service. Some have noted that the best hospitals have fewer re-admission rates than others, which benefits patients, but some of the worst hospitals have high re-admission rates which is bad for patients but is perversely rewarded under the <b>fee-for-service</b> system.|$|E

Prior to the 1960s, nonprofit organizations relied mostly on <b>fee-for-services</b> and charitable giving.

Additionally, governmental entities realized that by entering into a public-private partnership, they could fund nonprofit organizations and essentially hire then to provide services that governments did not want to provide. Nonprofit organizations began to apply and receive grant awards and appropriations for services. This trend in funding began to decline in the 1980s under the Reagan administration. With the reduction in funding available from the federal government, nonprofits have become increasingly competitive amongst each other.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates on the {{existence}} of physician-induced demand (PID) for French physicians. The test is carried out for GPs and specialists, using a representative sample of 4500 French self-employed physicians over the 1979 - 1993 period. These physicians receive a <b>fee-for-services</b> (FFS) payment and fees are controlled. The panel structure of our data allows us to take into account unobserved heterogeneity related to the characteristics of physicians and their patients. We use generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators in order to obtain consistent and efficient estimates. We show that physicians experience a decline of the number of consultations when they face an increase in the physician:population ratio. However this decrease is very slight. In addition, physicians counterbalance the fall in the number of consultations by an increase in the volume of care delivered in each encounter. Econometric results give a strong support for {{the existence}} of PID in the French system for ambulatory care. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Enteric illness {{arising from}} {{contaminated}} {{water and food}} is a major health concern worldwide, and tracking the incidences and severity of outbreaks is still a challenging task. Most developed and developing countries have administrative databases for medical visits and services maintained by the government and/or health insurance authorities. Although these databases could be extremely valuable resources to track patterns of environmental and other health issues, test hypotheses, and develop epidemiologic models and predictions, very {{little research has been}} done to develop methods to ensure the robustness of such databases and to demonstrate their utility as a research tool. OBJECTIVES: We used the Medical Services Plan (MSP) database of British Columbia, Canada, to develop innovative ways to use medical billing and <b>fee-for-services</b> data to track long-term patterns of enteric illness at the level of populations and communities. RESULTS: To illustrate the power and robustness of the method, we provided several examples covering 8 years of data from each of four communities covering a large range of population size. Not only could this method generalize to other diseases for which specific fee item markers can be found, but also it gives results consistent with a known outbreak and yields data patterns, which could not be revealed by the currently used methods. Because diagnostic code and fee item data for medical services are collected by most medical insurance agencies, our method can have global applications for tracking enteric and other illnesses at the level of populations and communities...|$|R
