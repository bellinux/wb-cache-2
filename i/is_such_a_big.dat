Getting married into that {{entertainment}} scene was a difficult thing – from that moment, his life {{was never going to}} be the same. He <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> celebrity, football is only a small part."' – Alex Ferguson speaking about Beckham's marriage in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Moyes joined Everton on 14 March 2002 {{and at his}} {{unveiling}} press conference, {{declared that}} Everton were 'The People's Club' on Merseyside. He said: [...] "I am from a city (Glasgow) that is not unlike Liverpool. I am joining the people's football club. The majority of people you meet on the street are Everton fans. It is a fantastic opportunity, something you dream about. I said 'yes' right away as it <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> club." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 15, 2005, a {{week after}} Smith's ruling, [...] the North Carolina chapter of the ACLU {{announced}} they would appeal the decision. Their lawyer Seth Cohen told reporters [...] "that the organization disagrees with the judge's finding" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "confident they will win in the N.C. Court of Appeals". Cohen went on to say: [...] "It's a shame that this matter cannot be resolved sooner. All we have ever asked is that people of all faiths be able to put their hands on the holy text of their choice. It's that simple. We don't understand why this <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> deal." [...] Cohen also said that members of Judaism have thrown their support behind the case as they {{would like to be able}} to swear on the Tanakh, and that this joining over the issue was one of the things [...] "that's gotten lost in this case".|$|E

2500|$|Responding to criticism, President Ahmadinejad said, [...] "Why do {{they think}} that 20 per cent <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> deal? Right now in Natanz we have the {{capability}} to enrich at over 20 per cent and at over 80 per cent, but because we don't need it, we won't do it." [...] He added [...] "If we wanted to manufacture a bomb, we would announce it." [...] On the same day as the President's announcement, Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, told Reuters that their 20% enrichment production, was going [...] "very well," [...] adding [...] "There is no limit on enrichment. We can enrich up to 100%... But we never had the intention and {{we do not have the}} intention to do so, unless we need (to)." [...] He maintained that the 20% production was for a Tehran medical reactor, and as such would be limited to around 1.5kg per month.|$|E
2500|$|The BBC assesses {{that many}} members of the Afghan public are vocal in support of Abdul Rahman's execution, though it does not {{estimate}} if these are in the majority. [...] "The courts should punish him and he should be put to death," [...] said Kabul dweller Abdul Zahid Paymen. Mohammed Qadir agrees that he must be executed: [...] "According to Islamic law he should be sentenced to death because Christianity is forbidden in our land". Abdul Rahman's neighbor remarked: [...] "there is no way we are going to allow an Afghan to insult us by becoming Christian." [...] Religious intellectual Shahnawaz Farooqui, speaking on Abdul Rahman's conversion, said [...] "he will have to be executed… If somebody at one point affirms the truth and then rejects it or denies it, it would jeopardize the whole paradigm of truth. This <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> offense that the penalty can only be death. At the very most, some scholars argue that the person should be given time to rethink, and if he embraces Islam again, he will be forgiven." ...|$|E

6000|$|Still Lucy wished Maggie {{to enjoy}} the sight also, {{especially}} as she would doubtless find {{a name for the}} toad, and say what had been his past history; for Lucy loved Maggie's stories about the live things they came upon by accident--how Mrs. Earwig had a wash at home, and one of her children had fallen into the hot copper, for which reason she was running so fast to fetch the doctor. So now the desire to know the history of a very portly toad made her run back to Maggie and say, [...] "Oh, there <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big,</b> funny toad, Maggie!

6000|$|... "I'm just as anxious as you are, Mary Louise. But {{this case}} is really puzzling, because Chicago <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> city that criminals may {{securely}} hide themselves here for months--even for years--without being discovered. Mrs. Orme was clever enough to leave few traces behind her; as far as clews are concerned she might have evaporated into thin air, taking Alora with her--except for this matter of the cabman. That's why I am pinning my faith to this search, knowing all the time, nevertheless, that Mrs. Orme may have provided for even that contingency and rendered {{the discovery of the}} cabman impossible. To do that, however, she would have to use a private equipage, involving a confederate, and I believe she preferred to take chances with a hired cab." ...|$|E
6000|$|The startling object which thus made an epoch for uncle Pullet was {{no other}} than little Lucy, with {{one side of her}} person, from her small foot to her bonnet-crown, wet and {{discolored}} with mud, holding out two tiny blackened hands, and making a very piteous face. To account for this unprecedented apparition in aunt Pullet's parlor, we must return to the moment when the three children went to play out of doors, and the small demons who had taken possession of Maggie's soul at an early period of the day had returned in all the greater force after a temporary absence. All the disagreeable recollections of the morning were thick upon her, when Tom, whose displeasure toward her had been considerably refreshed by her foolish trick of causing him to upset his cowslip wine, said, [...] "Here, Lucy, you come along with me," [...] and walked off to the area where the toads were, as if there were no Maggie in existence. Seeing this, Maggie lingered at a distance looking like a small Medusa with her snakes cropped. Lucy was naturally pleased that cousin Tom was so good to her, and it was very amusing to see him tickling a fat toad with a piece of string when the toad was safe down the area, with an iron grating over him. Still Lucy wished Maggie to enjoy the spectacle also, especially as she would doubtless find a name for the toad, and say what had been his past history; for Lucy had a delighted semibelief in Maggie's stories about the live things they came upon by accident,--how Mrs. Earwig had a wash at home, and one of her children had fallen into the hot copper, for which reason she was running so fast to fetch the doctor. Tom had a profound contempt for this nonsense of Maggie's, smashing the earwig at once as a superfluous yet easy means of proving the entire unreality of such a story; but Lucy, for the life of her, could not help fancying there was something in it, and at all events thought it was very pretty make-believe. So now the desire to know the history of a very portly toad, added to her habitual affectionateness, made her run back to Maggie and say, [...] "Oh, there <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big,</b> funny toad, Maggie! Do come and see!" ...|$|E
