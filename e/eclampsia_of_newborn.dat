40|$|Recognition <b>of</b> <b>newborn</b> {{after birth}} is a {{critical}} issue for hospitals, maternity word and other places where multiple birthstake place. Switching and abduction <b>of</b> <b>newborn</b> is a global challenge and research done to meet this challenge is minimal. Most of the biometric systems developed are for adults and {{very few of them}} address the issue <b>of</b> <b>newborn</b> identification. The ear <b>of</b> <b>newborn</b> is a perfect source of data for passiveidentification <b>of</b> <b>newborn</b> as they are the highly non cooperative users of biometrics. The four important characteristics of ear biometrics: universality, uniqueness, permanence and collectability make it a very potential biometric trait for the identification <b>of</b> <b>newborn.</b> Further the use of soft-biometric data like gender, blood group, height and weight along with ear enhances the accuracy for identification <b>of</b> <b>newborn.</b> The objective <b>of</b> this paper is to demonstrate the concept of fusing earand soft-biometrics for recognition <b>of</b> <b>newborn.</b> The main contributions of the research are (a) Design and implementation for fusion of ear and soft biometric for recognition <b>of</b> 210 <b>newborn.</b> (b) Preparation <b>of</b> ear and soft-biometric database <b>of</b> <b>newborn.</b> Fusion <b>of</b> ear and soft-biometrics results in an improvement of approximately 5. 59 % over the primary biometric system i. e. ear...|$|R

40|$|Background: Haemolytic Disease <b>of</b> <b>Newborn</b> is {{responsible}} {{for a number of}} neonatal deaths and complications worldwide. Its incidence in Zimbabwe is not clearly understood. Objective: To find out incidence of Haemolytic Disease <b>of</b> <b>Newborn</b> in Harare and ability to identify antibodies associated with HDN. Methods: A retrospective cross sectional study at the Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals and National Blood Service, Zimbabwe (NBSZ). We studied 22493 infants at Parirenyatwa Hospital during the 1995 - 1997 and 2002 - 2003 periods. The main outcome measures were ABO and Rh blood group results, Direct Antiglobulin Test and Maternal Antibody Screening and Identification Results were obtained from the NBSZ. Results: One hundred and ninety-one (0, 85 %) infants had Haemolytic Disease <b>of</b> <b>Newborn.</b> One hundred and sixty-three (85. 34 %) of these were due to anti-AB, twenty five (13. 09 %) were due to anti-D and three (1. 57 %) due to anti-Kell. Incidence of Haemolytic Disease <b>of</b> <b>Newborn</b> during 1995 - 1997 and 2002 - 2003, were 0. 93 % and 0. 64 %, respectively (p = 0. 014).

Conclusion: The incidence of Haemolytic Disease <b>of</b> <b>Newborn</b> at Parirenyatwa Hospital is comparable with that found in other countries.

40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{the paper}} {{is to examine the}} {{incidence}} and the rate of cardio respiratory disorders in mothers <b>of</b> <b>newborns</b> with diabetes mellitus in pregnancy as well as their influence on the perinatal outcome. Material and methods. A prospective and random study included 102 <b>newborns,</b> 31 <b>newborns</b> <b>of</b> mothers with glucose homeostasis disorder (group I) and 71 <b>newborns</b> <b>of</b> healthy mothers (group II). The average age, body height, body weight, body mass index, parity and illness duration of the pregnant women were recorded as well as the delivery method. Every newborn underwent physical examination {{in order to determine the}} Apgar score, body weight and length. Electrocardiogram, brain ultrasound and the basic hematology biochemical and microbiological analysis were done as well. Results. The average weight and obesity incidence were higher in diabetic women than in the control group and their newborns were heavier and of lower gestational age. Heart failures were diagnosed in 5 (1612 %) <b>newborns</b> <b>of</b> diabetic mothers and in 1 (1. 4 %) of a healthy pregnant woman (p< 0. 01). Respiratory disorders were diagnosed in 48. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>newborns</b> <b>of</b> diabetic mothers and 12. 64 % of healthy mothers (p< 0. 01). Additional oxygen was needed by 42 % <b>of</b> <b>newborns</b> <b>of</b> diabetic mothers and 19. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>newborns</b> <b>of</b> healthy mothers. Conclusion. Congenital anomalies of cardiovascular system and respiratory disorders were 6 - 8 times more frequent in <b>newborns</b> <b>of</b> diabetic mothers than in <b>newborns</b> <b>of</b> healthy mothers...|$|R

40|$|Every mother {{wants to}} give her child as much care as possible. Her care in the {{neonatal}} period is of special importance, because it may influence her child?s following development. It is essential that mothers be sufficiently informed about the newborn?s psychomotor development, and they should know that support may be started {{from the very first}} moment after the childbirth. The theoretical part of my thesis is focused on the knowledge about the psychomotor development <b>of</b> <b>newborns</b> and infants, about sensual perception <b>of</b> <b>newborns,</b> abilities and the importance of a mother?s first contact with her new-born child immediately after the child is born. The practical part deals with expectant mothers? knowledge about the correct development <b>of</b> <b>newborns.</b> Further, the practical part deals with interviews conducted with obstetricians who lead courses for future mothers. To process the question and achieve the objectives laid down, I had chosen the quantitative and qualitative research method. The quantitative and qualitative research was carried out by means of deep interviewing. I defined two objectives, and a hypothesis and a research question connected with these objectives. The first objective was focused on finding out whether mothers in the postpartum wards were informed about the physiological psychomotor development <b>of</b> <b>newborns,</b> and the second objective focused on finding out whether obstetricians were interested, within the courses for future mothers, in educating pregnant women about psychomotor development <b>of</b> <b>newborns.</b> Both objectives were fulfilled. I defined a hypothesis and a research question. Hypothesis 1 says ?Mothers in the postpartum wards are informed about the psychomotor development <b>of</b> <b>newborns</b> ?, and the research question is ?To what extent are obstetricians ready to include the education of expectant mothers about psychomotor development <b>of</b> <b>newborns,</b> within the courses for future mothers?? Hypothesis 1 was not confirmed, and it was found out {{in the second part of}} the research that three of four obstetricians are not ready to include the questions of psychomotor development <b>of</b> <b>newborns</b> in their courses for expectant mothers. The theoretical part forms a basis of a brochure for mothers, which sums up the basic information about psychomotor development <b>of</b> <b>newborns...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract 】 Recent {{research}} has shown that low‐income households have a higher probability of babies being born underweight, which is an indicator of poor health. The causes and effects of the weights <b>of</b> <b>newborn</b> babies need to be analyzed in Japan, where the proportion of low‐weight babies is extremely high relative to the other OECD countries. In this paper, we use panel data by prefecture to analyze the influence of market labor conditions on the weights <b>of</b> <b>newborn</b> babies in Japan. Controlling for heterogeneity among prefectures and years as random effects, we first show that high unemployment rates among parents do reduce the weights <b>of</b> <b>newborn</b> babies. However, our analysis does not confirm the influence of poverty and low income on the weights <b>of</b> <b>newborn</b> babies. Unemployment <b>of</b> parents may hamper the health of a baby for reasons other than financial difficulties. 【Key Words】unemployment, low birth‐weight, panel data, Japa...|$|R
