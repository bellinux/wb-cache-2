50|$|The {{origins of}} what would become UB40 began when in mid-1978 guitarist Ali Campbell, {{together}} with the rhythm section of drummer Jimmy Brown and bassist Earl Falconer, began rehearsing charting reggae songs in addition to {{some of their own}} original compositions. They were soon joined by several of their friends, firstly percussionists Yomi Babayemi and Norman Hassan, and then saxophonist Brian Travers and keyboardist Jimmy Lynn. Robin Campbell, although initially reluctant to commit to forming a band with the others, was invited to join once again by his brother and bought a guitar with which to do so in December of that year. Once Robin had joined the others in their jamming sessions, the eight musicians formed a band, deciding on the name 'UB40' after a friend suggested it was an appropriate name given the unemployed status of all of the band members. Prior to this, Travers had work as an electrical apprentice <b>for</b> <b>NG</b> Bailey; whilst Robin Campbell had been an apprentice toolmaker.|$|E
50|$|Two {{additional}} details lend credence to Ledyard's hypothesis. For one, {{the composition of}} obsolete ᇢᇦᇴ w, v, f (for Chinese initials 微非敷), from the graphic derivatives of the basic letter ㅂ b p (that is, ㅁㅂㅍ m, b, p) by adding a small circle under them, is parallel to their Phagspa equivalents, which were similarly derived by adding a small loop under three graphic variants of the letter h. Now, this small loop also represented w when it occurred after vowels in Phagspa. The Chinese initial 微 represented either m or w in various dialects, {{and this may be}} reflected in the choice of ㅁ m plus ㅇ (from Phagspa w) as the elements of hangul ᇢ. Not only is the series ᇢᇦᇴ analogous to Phagspa, but here we may have a second example of a letter composed of two elements to represent two regional pronunciations, m and w, as we saw with ᇰ <b>for</b> <b>ng</b> and null.|$|E
5000|$|In Welsh the digraphs CH, DD, FF, NG, LL, PH, RH, and TH {{are treated}} as single letters, and each is listed after the first {{character}} of the pair (except <b>for</b> <b>NG</b> which is listed after G), producing the order A, B, C, CH, D, DD, E, F, FF, G, NG, H, and so on. It can sometimes happen, however, that word compounding results in the juxtaposition of two letters which do not form a digraph. An example is the word LLONGYFARCH (composed from LLON + GYFARCH). This results in such an ordering as, for example, LAWR, LWCUS, LLONG, LLOM, LLONGYFARCH (NG is a digraph in LLONG, but not in LLONGYFARCH). The letter combination R+H (as distinct from the digraph RH) may similarly arise by juxtaposition in compounds, although this tends not to produce any pairs in which misidentification could affect the ordering. For the other potentially confusing letter combinations that may occur - namely, D+D and L+L - a hyphen {{is used in the}} spelling (e.g. AD-DAL, CHWIL-LYS).|$|E
