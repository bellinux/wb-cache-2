These watches are issued by the Weather Forecast Office and are usually issued six to 24 hours in advance of expected flood potential. In Canada, a Heavy Rainfall Warning has a similar meaning.|$|E

These were the first evictees from the estate. In Autumn 2000, CVHAT sought the eviction of five families who were accused of persistently breaking their tenancy conditions. This {{was considered to be}} a landmark case as it used a multi-trial approach where all five families could be tried at once, saving the HAT time and money. A further 20 families were given Notices of Seeking Possession during 2000, and the HAT collated evidence and built cases against the families. During this time, some of the families improved their behaviour whilst others left the estate. Those that were taken to court saw cases that involved 112 witness statements, supported by covert surveillance footage in some instances.|$|E

2500|$|In 1962 {{his first}} wife Terry {{was killed in a}} car accident. In part to recover from her loss, in 1963 Hamilton {{travelled}} {{for the first time to}} the United States for a retrospective of the works of Marcel Duchamp at the Pasadena Art Museum, where, as well as meeting other leading pop artists, he was befriended by Duchamp. Arising from this Hamilton curated the first British retrospective of Duchamp's work, and his familiarity with The <b>Green</b> <b>Box</b> enabled Hamilton to make copies of The Large Glass and other glass works too fragile to travel. The exhibition was shown at the Tate Gallery in 1966.|$|E
2500|$|Duchamp {{worked on}} his complex Futurism {{inspired}} piece The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass) from 1915 to 1923, {{with the exception of}} periods in Buenos Aires and Paris in 1918–1920. He executed the work on two panes of glass with materials such as lead foil, fuse wire, and dust. It combines chance procedures, plotted perspective studies, and laborious craftsmanship. He published notes for the piece, The <b>Green</b> <b>Box,</b> intended to complement the visual experience. They reflect the creation of unique rules of physics, and a mythology which describes the work. He stated that his [...] "hilarious picture" [...] is intended to depict the erotic encounter between a bride and her nine bachelors.|$|E
2500|$|Hamilton's {{early work}} was much {{influenced}} by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's 1917 text On Growth and Form. In 1952, {{at the first}} Independent Group meeting, held at the ICA, Hamilton was introduced to Eduardo Paolozzi's seminal presentation of collages produced in the late 1940s and early 1950s that are now {{considered to be the}} first standard bearers of Pop Art. Also in 1952, he was introduced to the <b>Green</b> <b>Box</b> notes of Marcel Duchamp through Roland Penrose, whom Hamilton had met at the ICA. At the ICA, Hamilton was responsible for the design and installation of a number of exhibitions including one on James Joyce and The Wonder and the Horror of the Human Head that was curated by Penrose. It was also through Penrose that Hamilton met Victor Pasmore who gave him a teaching post based in Newcastle Upon Tyne which lasted until 1966. Among the students Hamilton tutored at Newcastle in this period were Rita Donagh, Mark Lancaster, Tim Head, Roxy Music founder Bryan Ferry and Ferry's visual collaborator Nicholas de Ville. Hamilton's influence {{can be found in the}} visual styling and approach of Roxy Music. [...] He described Ferry as [...] "his greatest creation". Ferry repaid the compliment, naming him in 2010 as the living person he most admired, saying [...] "he greatly influenced my ways of seeing art and the world".|$|E

2500|$|The {{post at the}} ICA also afforded Hamilton {{the time}} to further his {{research}} on Duchamp, {{which resulted in the}} 1960 publication of a typographic version of Duchamp's <b>Green</b> <b>Box,</b> which comprised Duchamp's original notes for the design and construction of his famous work The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, also known as The Large Glass. Hamilton's 1955 exhibition of paintings at the Hanover Gallery were all in some form a homage to Duchamp. In the same year Hamilton organized the exhibition Man Machine Motion at the Hatton Gallery in Newcastle. Designed to look more like an advertising display than a conventional art exhibition the show prefigured Hamilton's contribution to the This Is Tomorrow exhibition in London, at the Whitechapel Gallery the following year. Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing? was created in 1956 for the catalogue of This Is Tomorrow, where it was reproduced in black and white and also used in posters for the exhibit. The collage depicts a muscle-man provocatively holding a Tootsie Pop and a woman with large, bare breasts wearing a lampshade hat, surrounded by emblems of 1950s affluence from a vacuum cleaner to a large canned ham. Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing? is widely acknowledged {{as one of the first}} pieces of Pop Art. Hamilton's written definition of what [...] "pop" [...] is laid the ground for the whole international movement. Hamilton's definition of Pop Art from a letter to Alison and Peter Smithson dated 16 January 1957 was: [...] "Pop Art is: popular, transient, expendable, low-cost, mass-produced, young, witty, sexy, gimmicky, glamorous, and Big Business", stressing its everyday, commonplace values. He thus created collages incorporating advertisements from mass-circulation newspapers and magazines.|$|E
