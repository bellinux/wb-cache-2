This study investigated the burning rate of selected wood materials as determined by heat release, mass loss and charring rates. Thick samples of redwood, southern pine, red oak and basswood were tested in a heat release rate calorimeter. Results on ignitability and average beat release, mass loss and charring rates are reported for a heat flux range between 15 and 55 kW m- 2. In this range, burning rate increased linearly with heat <b>flux.</b> <b>Burning</b> rate was very species dependent. Heat release rate was related to mass loss by effective heat of combustion, which also increased with beat flux. Charring rate was related to mass loss rate and original wood density. Important char property data such as yield, density and contraction are reported. A simplified calculation method is proposed for calculating mass loss rate and charring rate based on heat release rate...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{large-scale}} {{burning of}} crop residues in the North China Plain (NCP), {{one of the}} most densely populated world regions, was recently recognized to cause severe air pollution and harmful health effects. A reliable quantification of the magnitude of these fires is needed to assess regional air quality. Here, we use an eight-year record (2005 – 2012) of formaldehyde measurements from space to constrain the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in this region. Using inverse modelling, we derive that satellite-based post-harvest <b>burning</b> <b>fluxes</b> are, on average, at least a factor of 2 higher than state-of-the-art bottom-up statistical estimates, although with significant interannual variability. Crop burning is calculated to cause important increases in surface ozone (+ 7 %) and fine aerosol concentrations (+ 18 %) in the North China Plain in June. The impact of crop fires is also found in satellite observations of other species, glyoxal, nitrogen dioxide and methanol, and we show that those measurements validate the magnitude of the top-down fluxes. Our study indicates that the top-down crop <b>burning</b> <b>fluxes</b> of VOCs in June exceed by almost a factor of 2 the combined emissions from other anthropogenic activities in this region, underscoring the need for targeted actions towards changes in agricultural management practices...|$|R

40|$|Triple flames {{formed in}} methane/air mixing layers with three {{different}} mixture fraction gradients were investigated by numerical simulation. The primitive variable method, in which the fully elliptic governing equations were solved with detailed chemistry and complex thermal and transport properties, was used. Radiation heat transfer from CO 2, CO and H 2 O was calculated using the discrete-ordinates method coupled to a statistical narrow band correlated-K based wide band model. The results show that {{with the increase of}} the mixture fraction gradient, the combustion intensity in the diffusion flame branch of a triple flame is enhanced. In the near-stoichiometric mixture fraction region, the local <b>burning</b> <b>flux</b> of a triple flame is reduced when the mixture fraction gradient is increased. However, when the mixture fraction is significantly different from the stoichiometric value, the local <b>burning</b> <b>flux</b> increases as the mixture fraction gradient is increased. The correlation of the burning speed versus stretch rate established from conventional homogeneous premixed flames cannot completely explain the phenomena observed in triple flames. The interaction between the diffusion and premixed flame branches significantly affects the local burning velocity in regions where the mixture fraction is far from the stoichiometric value in a triple flame. This interaction is caused by both conduction heat transfer and radical exchange. Radiation has negligible effect on local burning properties in a triple flame.

40|$|Although {{fire has}} been used for several {{thousand}} years to maintain Miscanthus sinensis grasslands in Japan, there is little information about the nutrient dynamics in these ecosystems immediately after burning. We investigated the loss of aboveground biomass; carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics; surface soil C change before and after burning; and carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) fluxes 2 h after burning in a M. sinensis grassland in Kumamoto, Japan. We calculated average C and N accumulation rates within the soil profile over the past 7300 years, which were 58. 0 kg C ha− 1 yr− 1 and 2. 60 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1, respectively. After burning, 98 % of aboveground biomass and litter were consumed. Carbon remaining on the field, however, was 102 kg C ha− 1. We found at least 43 % of C was possibly lost due to decomposition. However, remaining C, which contained ash and charcoal, appeared to contribute to C accumulation in soil. There was no difference in the amount of 0 – 5 cm surface soil C before and after burning. The amount of remaining litter on the soil surface indicated burning appeared not to have caused a reduction in soil C nor did it negatively impact the sub-surface vegetative crown of M. sinensis. Also, nearly 50 kg N ha− 1 of total aboveground biomass and litter N was lost due to burning. Compared with before the burning event, postburning CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes from soil appeared not to be directly affected by burning. However, it appears the short time span of measurements of N 2 O <b>flux</b> after <b>burning</b> sufficiently characterized the pattern of increasing N 2 O <b>fluxes</b> immediately after <b>burning.</b> These findings indicate burning did not cause significant reductions in soil C nor did it result in elevated CO 2 and CH 4 emissions from the soil relative to before the burning event...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{controls}} fire regimes {{through its}} influence on the amount and types of fuel present and their dryness. CO 2 concentration constrains primary production by limiting photosynthetic activity in plants. However, although fuel accumulation depends on biomass production, and hence on CO 2 concentration, the quantitative relationship between atmospheric CO 2 concentration and biomass burning is not well understood. Here a fire-enabled dynamic global vegetation model (the Land surface Processes and eXchanges model, LPX) is used to attribute glacial–interglacial changes in biomass burning {{to an increase in}} CO 2, which would be expected to increase primary production and therefore fuel loads {{even in the absence of}} climate change, vs. climate change effects. Four general circulation models provided last glacial maximum (LGM) climate anomalies – that is, differences from the pre-industrial (PI) control climate – from the Palaeoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase~ 2, allowing the construction of four scenarios for LGM climate. Modelled carbon <b>fluxes</b> from biomass <b>burning</b> were corrected for the model's observed prediction biases in contemporary regional average values for biomes. With LGM climate and low CO 2 (185 ppm) effects included, the modelled global flux at the LGM was in the range of 1. 0 – 1. 4 Pg C year - 1, about a third less than that modelled for PI time. LGM climate with pre-industrial CO 2 (280 ppm) yielded unrealistic results, with global biomass <b>burning</b> <b>fluxes</b> similar to or even greater than in the pre-industrial climate. It is inferred that a substantial part of the increase in biomass burning after the LGM must be attributed to the effect of increasing CO 2 concentration on primary production and fuel load. Today, by analogy, both rising CO 2 and global warming must be considered as risk factors for increasing biomass burning. Both effects need to be included in models to project future fire risks...|$|R
40|$|The paper reports {{experiments}} {{employing the}} cloud chamber technique for creating fuel aerosols, {{in studies of}} premixed laminar flames. Spherical explosion flames were initiated at different times {{after the start of}} expansion of the original gaseous mixture to lower pressure. Flame speeds were measured close to atmospheric pressure, over a range of equivalence ratios of iso-octane, ethanol and hydrous ethanol with air. A methodology was developed for deriving mass burning velocities and entrainment velocities, as well as mass <b>burning</b> <b>fluxes,</b> from the measurements of aerosol number densities, droplet sizes and flame speeds. It was vital to estimate whether droplet evaporation was completed in the flame preheat zone. This was done by calculating the spatial progress of droplet evaporation for the different aerosols from values of the evaporation rate constants of the different fuels. With predominantly the leaner mixtures and smaller droplet diameters, evaporation was close to completion, but the mass burning velocities of the aerosols were somewhat lower than those of the corresponding gaseous phases, because of the lower final temperatures due to the required evaporation enthalpies. However, the mass <b>burning</b> <b>fluxes</b> were higher than those for the purely gaseous flames, due to the higher two-phase reactant densities. At the higher values of the liquid phase equivalence ratio, in overall lean mixtures, the mass burning velocity could exceed that in the purely gaseous phase due to localised enrichment around the droplets. The presence of fuel droplets is shown to enhance the generation of Darrieus-Landau, thermo-diffusive instabilities and the associated flame wrinkling. With richer mixtures and larger droplets, it is possible for droplets to enter the reaction zone and further enhance existing gaseous phase instabilities through the creation of yet further flame wrinkling. This leads to the maximum entrained fuel mass flux, in the richest mixture, being significantly higher than that occurring at the maximum burning velocity of a premixed gaseous flame...|$|R

These experiments were performed over a range of wind tunnel speeds, with no wind speed present to 9 m/s, to determine the lofting distance of the firebrands generated.

40|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} three different management scenarios {{in relation to}} their ability to maximize the carbon balance. The study was carried out within a context of managed even-aged sessile oak stands, and the management scenarios were contrasted in terms of stem density and rotation length. A system of models designed to represent the whole forest-wood product chain was used to assess the carbon balance of each scenario. The boundaries of this system were extended as far as possible to prevent any carbon leaks. Dead organic matter and disposed harvested wood products (HWPs) were taken into account in the assessment. The scenarios were compared in terms of their average stock in the forest and the HWP carbon pools, as well as some additional fluxes. These included: (i) substitution for fossil fuel; (ii) carbon emissions due to HWP processing; (iii) the accumulation of non-degradable carbon in the landfill; and (iv) methane emissions resulting from anaerobic decomposition of disposed HWPs. Results showed that the HWP carbon pools were about 10 times smaller than the forest carbon pools. The substitution for fossil fuel constituted the largest positive flux, whereas methane emissions in absence of methane recovery facilities accounted for 40 % of the negative <b>fluxes.</b> The <b>burning</b> of wood products for energy was preferable to HWP disposal at the landfill site. As long as the risk of extreme climate events remains marginal, management scenarios that maintain higher stem densities over longer rotation lengths appeared to be favorable to carbon sequestration.

The fire field model Fire Dynamics Simulator is {{selected as the}} tool. Full-scale burning tests with a water mist fire suppression system {{will be used for}} validating the predicted results. There, water droplet size, velocity, and water flux distribution from the nozzle measured were taken as parameters. Fire was set up by burning horizontal sheet of polymethylmethacrylate of 0. 25 m square. As this CFD model is coupled to the solid surface, steady burning rates and extinguishment with water mist can be predicted. For the gas phase, the fire-induced flow is modeled with Large Eddy Simulation (LES), mixture fraction based combustion model, and discrete ordinate radiation model. For the liquid phase, water mist is described by a number of droplets tracked in a Lagrangian fashion. The interaction of mass, momentum, and heat transfer between water droplets and fire are included as source terms in the gas phase equations-i. e., the "Particle-Source-in-Cell" method.

Among the new timing phenomena revealed by RXTE the burst oscillations are perhaps the best understood, in the sense that many of their properties can be explained in the framework of this relatively simple model. Because of this, detailed modelling of burst oscillations can be an extremely powerful probe of neutron star structure, and thus the equation of state (EOS) of supra-nuclear density matter. Both the compactness parameter beta = GM/c(sup 2) R, and the surface velocity, nu(sub rot) = Omega(sub spin) R, are encoded in the energy-dependent amplitude and shape of the modulation pulses.

40|$|Abstract. Among all global ecosystems, {{tropical}} savannas are {{the most}} severely and extensively affected by anthropogenic burning. Frequency of fire in cerrado, a type of tropical savanna covering 25 % of Brazil, is 2 to 4 years. In 1992 we measured soil fluxes of NO, N 20, C~. and C 02 from cerrado sites that had been burned within the previous 2 days, 30 days, I year, and from a control site last burned in 1976. NO and N 20 fluxes responded dramatically to fire with the highest fluxes observed from newly burned soils after addition of water. Emissions of N-trace gases after burning were of similar magnitude to estimated emissions during combustion. NO <b>fluxes</b> immediately after <b>burning</b> are among the highest observed for any ecosystem studied to date. These rates declined with time after burning and had returned to control levels 1 year after the bum. An assessment of our data suggested that tropical savanna, burned or unburned, is {{a major source of}} NO to the troposphere. Cerrado appeared to be a minor source of N 20 and a sink for atmospheric CH 4. Burning also elevated C 02 fluxes, which remained detectably elevated I year later...|$|R

Flames were generated with a porous 25 mm circular burner using mixtures of methane and propane with nitrogen. The procedure was to specify a set of mass fluxes of nitrogen-fuel mixture that corresponded to the flash- fire- and extinction points and for the minimum mass <b>flux</b> where steady <b>burning</b> was achieved. The results show an increase in the critical mass flux with a decreased heat of combustion. The data fall into two regimes depending on the mixture flow rate; one buoyancy-driven (Fr< 1) and one induced by momentum jet forces. The buoyancy-driven regime is geometrically consistent with the definitions of flash and fire points under natural convection conditions. The results for the momentum regime align reasonably with existing stagnant layer theory. Extinction theory is also suggested to give approximate results for the fire point. This argument is based on similar flame geometries for fire point and extinction and theoretical reasoning. An anchor point is proposed as the end point of ignition. Produced anchor point data result in a flammability diagram, below which quasi-steady burning occurs...|$|R

As of 2011, the expansion of agricultural soils, which are ∼ 70 % less efficient at consuming methane than undisturbed soils, to 59 % of Australia's land mass (456 Mha) and increasing livestock densities in northern Australia suggest negative implications for national methane <b>flux.</b> Plant biomass <b>burning</b> {{does not appear to have}} long-term negative effects on methane flux unless soils are converted for agricultural purposes.

40|$|A burner for {{investigating}} lean stratified premixed flames propagating in intense isotropic turbulence has been developed. Lean pre-mixtures of methane at different equivalence ratios are divided between two concentric co-flows to obtain annular stratification. Turbulence generators {{are used to}} control the level of turbulence intensity in the oncoming flow. A third annular weakly swirling air flow provides the flame stabilization mechanism. A fundamental characteristic is that flame stabilization does not rely on flow recirculation. The flames are maintained at a position where the local mass <b>flux</b> balances the <b>burning</b> rate, {{the result is a}} freely propagating turbulent flame front. The absence of physical surfaces {{in the vicinity of the}} flame provides free access for laser diagnostics. Stereoscopic Planar Image Velocimetry (SPIV) has been applied to obtain the three components of the instantaneous velocity vectors on a vertical plane above the burner outlet where the flames propagate. The instantaneous temperature fields have been determined through Laser Induced Rayleigh (LIRay) scattering. Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) on acetone has been used to calculate the average equivalence ratio distributions. Instantaneous turbulent burning velocities have been extracted from SPIV results, while flame curvature and flame thermal thickness values have been calculated using the instantaneous temperature fields. The probability distributions of these quantities have been compared considering the separate influence of equivalence ratio stratification and turbulence. It has been observed that increased levels of turbulence determine higher turbulent burning velocities and flame front wrinkling. Flames characterized by stronger fuel stratification showed higher values in turbulent burning velocities. From the curvature analysis emerged that increased fuel concentration gradients favour flame wrinkling, especially when associated with positive small radius of curvature. This determines an increased surface area available for reaction that promotes a faster propagation of the flame front in the oncoming combustible mixtures.

The peak un-stretched flame speeds of the blends occur in an equivalence ratio range of 1. 1 – 1. 2 at all temperatures, closer to the case of MF at higher temperatures. Both blended fuels have Markstein lengths closer to isooctane at an equivalence ratio lower than 1. 2 at all temperatures. The burning velocities of MF 50 are very close to the average values for MF and isooctane, particularly at 393 K. MF in the blended fuel presents larger effects on burning velocities at higher temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Tropospheric {{chemistry}} and air quality processes were implemented on-line in the Global Environmental Multiscale weather prediction model. The integrated model, GEM-AQ, was {{developed as a}} platform to investigate chemical weather at scales from global to urban. The current chemical mechanism is comprised of 50 gas-phase species, 116 chemical and 19 photolysis reactions, and is complemented by a sectional aerosol module with 5 aerosols types. All tracers are advected using the semi-Lagrangian scheme native to GEM. The vertical transport includes parameterized subgrid-scale turbulence and large scale deep convection. Dry deposition is included as a flux boundary condition in the vertical diffusion equation. Wet deposition of gas-phase species is treated in a simplified way, and only below-cloud scavenging is considered. The emissions used include yearly-averaged anthropogenic, and monthly-averaged biogenic, ocean, soil, and biomass <b>burning</b> emission <b>fluxes,</b> as well as NO x from lightning. In order to evaluate the ability to simulate seasonal variations and regional distributions of trace gases such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, the model was run {{for a period of}} five years (2001 – 2005) on a global uniform 1. 5 °× 1. 5 ° horizontal resolution domain and 28 hybrid levels extending up to 10 hPa. Model results were compared with observations from satellites, aircraft measurement campaigns and balloon sondes. We find that GEM-AQ is able to capture the spatial details of the chemical fields in the middle and lower troposphere. The modelled ozone consistently shows good agreement with observations, except over tropical oceans. The comparison of carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide with satellite measurements emphasizes the need for more accurate, year-specific emissions <b>fluxes</b> for biomass <b>burning</b> and anthropogenic sources. Other species also compare well with available observations...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to investigate three upward flame spread phenomena of particular importance for fire safety applications. First, rates of upward flame spread during early-stage burning were observed during experiments on wide samples of corrugated cardboard. Results indicated a slower acceleration than was obtained in previous measurements and theories. It is hypothesized that the non-homogeneity of the cardboard helped to reduce the acceleration of the upward spread rates by physically disrupting flow in the boundary layer close to the vertical surface and thereby modifying heating rates of the solid fuel above the pyrolysis region. The results yield alternative scalings that may be better applicable to some situations encountered in practice in warehouse fires. Next, a thermally thick slab of polymethyl methacrylate was used to study the effects of the inclination angle of a fuel surface on upward flame spread. By performing experiments on 10 cm wide by 20 cm tall fuel samples {{it was found that the}} maximum flame- spread rate, occurring nearly in a vertical configuration, does not correspond to the maximum fuel mass-loss rate, which occurs closer to a horizontal configuration. A detailed study of both flame spread and steady burning at different angles of inclination revealed the influence of buoyancy-induced flows in modifying heat-flux profiles ahead of the flame front, which control flame spread, and in affecting the heat <b>flux</b> to the <b>burning</b> surface of the fuel, which controls fuel mass-loss rates. Finally, vertical arrays of horizontally protruding wood matchsticks were used to investigate the influence of the spacing of discrete fuel elements on rates of upward flame spread. Rates of upward flame spread were found to increase dramatically for spacings between 0 cm and 0. 8 cm and experienced only a slight increase thereafter. Based on these observations, the influence of convective heating was hypothesized to dominate this spread mechanism, and predictions of ignition times were developed using convective heat-transfer correlations. Mass-loss rates followed a similar pattern and were predicted along with matchstick burnout times using a droplet burning theory extended for a cylindrical geometr...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAromatic species {{represent}} a significant fraction (about one third by weight) of both diesel and gasoline fuels. Much of the aromatics in diesel and gasoline are alkyl-benzene species. Although toluene, the lightest of the alkyl-benzenes, {{has been the}} subject of extensive literature investigations, very little experimental data are available for heavier alkyl-benzenes (9 – 20 carbon atoms) relevant to diesel fuel. In this work, the burning velocity of ethyl-, n-propyl-and n-butyl-benzenes were measured in a premixed flat-flame burner using the heat <b>flux</b> method. The <b>burning</b> velocities were measured as a function of the equivalence ratio at atmospheric pressure and for two unburned gas temperatures (358 and 398 K). These new experiments are compared with burning velocities for toluene previously measured by the authors. The comparisons showed that ethyl-benzene has the highest flame speed, followed by n-propyl-and n-butyl-benzenes which have similar burning velocities. Toluene has the lowest flame speed. Excellent agreement was observed between the new measurements and simulations using a mechanism for alkyl-benzenes recently published by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and National University of Ireland. Based on the strong correlation between experiments and calculations, different aspects contributing to the burning speed of the fuels (thermal effects, kinetics, …) were analyzed using the model. A sensitivity analysis was used to determine the reaction rate constants that are most important in determining the flame speed. Reaction path analysis and species profiles in the flame were used to identify the key reaction paths that lead to increase or decrease in the burning velocities. Contrary to what is generally observed for alkanes whose flame speed is controlled by small radical fragments, the flame speed of aromatics is influenced by fuel specific intermediates such as phenyl, benzyl, or even heavier species. The new experimental data and modeling insight generated by this work will support the development of models for heavier alkyl-aromatics of great relevance to diesel fuel...|$|R
40|$|The planned joint French‐German {{satellite}} mission MERLIN aims {{to measure}} columnintegrated atmospheric methane abundances using a spaceborne Integrated Path Differential Absorption (IPDA) lidar. The very small measurement footprint {{of the single}} shot measurements (150 m) means that the sensor {{will be able to}} make measurements even in the presence of broken clouds. In order to attain the targeted measurement precision, many measurements, spaced roughly 600 m apart, will be averaged along a measurement path of approximately 50 km, resulting in a measurement footprint of 150 m by 50 km. This presents some unusual challenges for the validation of the measurement, particularly over regions with a great deal of heterogeneity in the sources. Furthermore, the planned dawn‐dusk orbit results in significant time offsets with measurements from the TCCON network, particularly in the winter and at higher latitudes, as the FTS measurements require a clear line‐of‐sight to the sun. In order to address the representativity of various in‐situ and ground‐based remote sensing measurement systems with respect to the MERLIN measurement, a series of mesoscale tracer transport simulations at resolutions of up to 2 km have been sub‐sampled in order to produce satellite pseudo‐data. These pseudo‐measurements are then compared to pseudo‐data created with sampling consistent with ground‐based remote sensing (TCCON‐like), routine profile measurement made by passenger aircraft (IAGOS‐like), balloon‐based profile measurements (AirCore‐like), and sampling consistent with a dedicated validation campaign. Results from mesoscale simulations over Europe, as well as regions of Western Siberia and the Amazon with significant wetland and biomass <b>burning</b> <b>fluxes</b> are considered in the study. The appropriateness of each type of measurement system for the validation of MERLIN measurements is assessed, including the length of time that would be required to develop sufficient coincidences in space and time to achieve a statistically significant comparison. Optimal strategies for dedicated validation campaigns are discussed. Finally, the results are upscaled globally, based on process‐based flux maps and heterogeneity observed in simulations of XCH 4 using a global atmospheric tracer transport model. Comparisons to results for XCO 2 are also presented...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{existing}} understanding of flame spread dynamics is enhanced through an extensive {{study of the}} heat transfer from flames spreading vertically upwards across 5 cm wide, 20 cm tall samples of extruded Poly (Methyl Methacrylate) (PMMA). These experiments have provided highly spatially resolved measurements of flame to surface heat <b>flux</b> and material <b>burning</b> rate at the critical length scale of interest, {{with a level of}} accuracy and detail unmatched by previous empirical or computational studies. Using these measurements, a wall flame model was developed that describes a flame’s heat feedback profile (both in the continuous flame region and the thermal plume above) solely as a function of material burning rate. 	Additional experiments were conducted to measure flame heat flux and sample mass loss rate as flames spread vertically upwards over the surface of seven other commonly used polymers, two of which are glass reinforced composite materials. Using these measurements, our wall flame model has been generalized such that it can predict heat feedback from flames supported by a wide range of materials. For the seven materials tested here – which present a varied range of burning behaviors including dripping, polymer melt flow, sample burnout, and heavy soot formation – model-predicted flame heat flux has been shown to match experimental measurements (taken across the full length of the flame) with an average accuracy of 3. 9 kW m- 2 (approximately 10 – 15 % of peak measured flame heat flux). 	This flame model has since been coupled with a powerful solid phase pyrolysis solver, ThermaKin 2 D, which computes the transient rate of gaseous fuel production of constituents of a pyrolyzing solid in response to an external heat flux, based on fundamental physical and chemical properties. Together, this unified model captures the two fundamental controlling mechanisms of upward flame spread – gas phase flame heat transfer and solid phase material degradation. This has enabled simulations of flame spread dynamics with a reasonable computational cost and accuracy beyond that of current models. This unified model of material degradation provides the framework to quantitatively study material burning behavior in response {{to a wide range of}} common fire scenarios...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} biomass burning from Southeast Asia to East Asia, this study conducted numerical simulations during NASA's 2006 Biomass-burning Aerosols in South-East Asia: Smoke Impact Assessment (BASE-ASIA). Two typical episode periods (27 – 28 March and 13 – 14 April) were examined. Two emission inventories, FLAMBE and GFED, {{were used in the}} simulations. The influences during two episodes in the source region (Southeast Asia) contributed to CO, O 3 and PM 2. 5 concentrations as high as 400 ppbv, 20 ppbv and 80 μg/m 3 , respectively. The perturbations with and without biomass burning of the above three species were in the range of 10 to 60 %, 10 to 20 % and 30 to 70 %, respectively. The impact due to long-range transport could spread over the southeastern parts of East Asia and could reach about 160 to 360 ppbv, 8 to 18 ppbv and 8 to 64 μg/m 3 on CO, O 3 and PM 2. 5 , respectively; the percentage impact could reach 20 to 50 % on CO, 10 to 30 % on O 3 , and as high as 70 % on PM 2. 5 . An impact pattern can be found in April, while the impact becomes slightly broader and goes up to Yangtze River Delta. Two cross-sections at 15 ° N and 20 ° N were used to compare the vertical <b>flux</b> of biomass <b>burning.</b> In the source region (Southeast Asia), CO, O 3 and PM 2. 5 concentrations had a strong upward tendency from surface to high altitudes. The eastward transport becomes strong from 2 to 8 km in the free troposphere. The subsidence contributed 60 to 70 %, 20 to 50 %, and 80 % on CO, O 3 and PM 2. 5 , respectively to surface in the downwind area. The study reveals the significant impact of Southeastern Asia biomass burning on the air quality in both local and downwind areas, particularly during biomass burning episodes. This modeling study might provide constraints of lower limit. An additional study is underway for an active biomass burning year to obtain an upper limit and climate effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{clearing}} and burning of tropical savanna leads to globally significant emissions {{of greenhouse gases}} (GHGs); however there is large uncertainty relating to the magnitude of this flux. Australia's tropical savannas occupy the northern quarter of the continent, a region of increasing interest for further exploitation of land and water resources. Land use decisions across this vast biome have the potential to influence the national greenhouse gas budget. To better quantify emissions from savanna deforestation and investigate the impact of deforestation on national GHG emissions, we undertook a paired site measurement campaign where emissions were quantified from two tropical savanna woodland sites; one that was deforested and prepared for agricultural land use and a second analogue site that remained uncleared for the duration of a 22 -month campaign. At both sites, net ecosystem exchange of CO 2 was measured using the eddy covariance method. Observations at the deforested site were continuous before, during and after the clearing event, providing high-resolution data that tracked CO 2 emissions through nine phases of land use change.  At the deforested site, post-clearing debris was allowed to cure for 6 months and was subsequently burnt, followed by extensive soil preparation for cropping. During the debris <b>burning,</b> <b>fluxes</b> of CO 2 as measured by the eddy covariance tower were excluded. For this phase, emissions were estimated by quantifying on-site biomass prior to deforestation and applying savanna-specific emission factors to estimate a fire-derived GHG emission that included both CO 2 and non-CO 2 gases. The total fuel mass that was consumed during the debris burning was 40. 9  Mg C ha − 1 and included above- and below-ground woody biomass, course woody debris, twigs, leaf litter and C 4 grass fuels. Emissions from the burning were added to the net CO 2 fluxes as measured by the eddy covariance tower for other post-deforestation phases to provide a total GHG emission from this land use change. The total emission from this savanna woodland was 148. 3  Mg CO 2 -e ha − 1 with the debris burning responsible for 121. 9  Mg CO 2 -e ha − 1 or 82...|$|R
40|$|We report recent {{progress}} {{derived from}} comparison of global CO 2 flux and transport models with new remote sensing {{and other sources}} of CO 2 data including those from satellite. The overall objective of this activity {{is to improve the}} process models that represent our understanding of the workings of the atmospheric carbon cycle. Model estimates of CO 2 surface flux and atmospheric transport processes are required for initial constraints on inverse analyses, to connect atmospheric observations to the location of surface sources and sinks, to provide the basic framework for carbon data assimilation, and ultimately for future projections of carbon-climate interactions. Models {{can also be used to}} test consistency within and between CO 2 data sets under varying geophysical states. Here we focus on simulated CO 2 fluxes from terrestrial vegetation and atmospheric transport mutually constrained by analyzed meteorological fields from the Goddard Modeling and Assimilation Office for the period 2000 through 2009. Use of assimilated meteorological data enables direct model comparison to observations across a wide range of scales of variability. The biospheric fluxes are produced by the CASA model at 1 x 1 degrees on a monthly mean basis, modulated hourly with analyzed temperature and sunlight. Both physiological and biomass <b>burning</b> <b>fluxes</b> are derived using satellite observations of vegetation, burned area (as in GFED- 3), and analyzed meteorology. For the purposes of comparison to CO 2 data, fossil fuel and ocean fluxes are also included in the transport simulations. In this presentation we evaluate the model's ability to simulate CO 2 flux and mixing ratio variability in comparison to remote sensing observations from TCCON, GOSAT, and AIRS as well as relevant in situ observations. Examples of the influence of key process representations are shown from both forward and inverse model comparisons. We find that the model can resolve much of the synoptic, seasonal, and interannual variability in the observations, although reasons for persistent discrepancies in northern hemisphere vegetation uptake are examined. At this time, we do not find any serious shortcomings in the model transport representation, but this is still the subject of close scrutiny. In general, the fidelity of these simulations leads us to anticipate incorporation of real-time, highly resolved remote sensing and other observations into quantitative analyses that will reduce uncertainty in CO 2 fluxes and revolutionize our understanding of the key processes controlling atmospheric CO 2 and its evolution with time...|$|R
40|$|As {{we enter}} the new era of {{satellite}} remote sensing for CO 2 and other carbon cyclerelated quantities, advanced modeling and analysis capabilities are required to fully capitalize on the new observations. Model estimates of CO 2 surface flux and atmospheric transport are required for initial constraints on inverse analyses, to connect atmospheric observations {{to the location of}} surface sources and sinks, and ultimately for future projections of carbon-climate interactions. For application to current, planned, and future remotely sensed CO 2 data, it is desirable that these models are accurate and unbiased at time scales from less than daily to multi-annual and at spatial scales from several kilometers or finer to global. Here we focus on simulated CO 2 fluxes from terrestrial vegetation and atmospheric transport mutually constrained by analyzed meteorological fields from the Goddard Modeling and Assimilation Office for the period 1998 through 2006. Use of assimilated meteorological data enables direct model comparison to observations across a wide range of scales of variability. The biospheric fluxes are produced by the CASA model at lxi degrees on a monthly mean basis, modulated hourly with analyzed temperature and sunlight. Both physiological and biomass <b>burning</b> <b>fluxes</b> are derived using satellite observations of vegetation, burned area (as in GFED- 2), and analyzed meteorology. For the purposes of comparison to CO 2 data, fossil fuel and ocean fluxes are also included in the transport simulations. In this presentation we evaluate the model's ability to simulate CO 2 flux and mixing ratio variability in comparison to in situ observations at sites in Northern mid latitudes and the continental tropics. The influence of key process representations is inferred. We find that the model can resolve much of the hourly to synoptic variability in the observations, although there are limits imposed by vertical resolution of boundary layer processes. The seasonal cycle and its interannual variations generally respond adequately, but discrepancies in the tropics suggest the need for a refinement of the soil moisture dependence of the respiration flux in CASA. Examples and inferences for interpretation of satellite data will be discussed.

40|$|Formaldehyde columns {{retrieved}} from the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography/Chemistry (SCIAMACHY) instrument onboard ENVISAT satellite through 2003 to 2006 {{are used as}} top-down constraints to derive updated global biogenic and biomass <b>burning</b> <b>flux</b> estimates for the non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) precursors of formaldehyde. Our interest is centered over regions experiencing strong emissions, and hence exhibiting a high signal-to-noise ratio and lower measurement uncertainties. The formaldehyde dataset {{used in this study}} has been recently made available to the community and complements the long record of formaldehyde measurements from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME). We use the IMAGESv 2 global chemistry-transport model driven by the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) version 1 or 2 for biomass burning, and from the newly developed MEGAN-ECMWF isoprene emission database. The adjoint of the model is implemented in a grid-based framework within which emission fluxes are derived at the model resolution, together with a differentiation of the sources in a grid cell. Two inversion studies are conducted using either the GFEDv 1 or GFEDv 2 as a priori for the pyrogenic fluxes. Although on the global scale the inferred emissions from the two categories exhibit only weak deviations from the corresponding a priori estimates, the regional updates often present large departures from their a priori values. The posterior isoprene emissions over North America, amounting to about 34 Tg C/yr, are estimated to be on average by 25 % lower than the a priori over 2003 - 2006, whereas a strong increase (55 %) is deduced over the south African continent, the optimized emission being estimated at 57 Tg C/yr. Over Indonesia the biogenic emissions appear to be overestimated by 20 - 30 %, whereas over Indochina and the Amazon basin during the wet season the a priori inventory captures both the seasonality and the magnitude of the observed columns. Although neither biomass burning inventory seems to be consistent with the data over all regions, pyrogenic estimates inferred from the two inversions are reasonably similar, despite their a priori deviations. A number of sensitivity experiments are conducted in order {{to assess the impact of}} uncertainties related to the inversion setup and the chemical mechanism. Whereas changes in the background error covariance matrix have only a limited impact on the posterior fluxes, the use of an alternative isoprene mechanism characterized by lower HCHO yields (the GEOS-Chem mechanism) increases the posterior isoprene source estimate by 11 % over northern America, and by up to 40 % in tropical regions...|$|R
