5|$|In January 1995, Qubilah Shabazz {{was charged}} with trying to hire an assassin to kill Farrakhan in {{retaliation}} for the murder of her father. Farrakhan surprised the Shabazz family when he defended Qubilah, saying he did not think she was guilty and that he hoped she would not be convicted. That May, Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan shook hands on the stage of the Apollo Theater during a public event intended to raise money for Qubilah's legal defense. Some heralded the evening as a reconciliation between the two, but others thought Shabazz was <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> she had to in order to protect her daughter. Regardless, nearly $250,000 was raised that evening. In the aftermath, Shabazz maintained a cool relationship with Farrakhan, although she agreed to speak at his Million Man March that October.|$|E

60|$|Does {{that seem}} no great gain to you? Let {{me put it}} a little plainer. St. Paul means this, and just this, {{that you may not}} <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> you like. St. Paul thought it the very best thing for a man {{not to be able to}} <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> he liked.

25|$|Although {{in larger}} forces the cavalry might be {{sufficient}} in {{numbers for the}} heavy regiments to be concentrated for use in ‘shock’ action, in armies with less cavalry the available troops might have to fulfill whatever role was needed, without the luxury {{of being able to}} allocate particular units to a specific duty. Wellington advocated the view that all cavalry should be capable of <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> was required ‘be they dressed or armed as they may’.

25|$|Spring 1860 {{found them}} in Lugano, Switzerland, from where they rushed to Genoa {{to be part of}} the second wave of volunteers going to Sicily to join Garibaldi in his lightning-fast conquest of the Bourbon-controlled {{southern}} half of Italy. Alberto was on Garibaldi’s staff and Jessie was nurse to the wounded, <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> was needed. This included tightly holding a boy while his arm was amputated without anaesthesia. Skills learned and refined during this war were used again in 1866 in the war against the Austrians west of Venice; in 1867 at Monterotondo and Mentana, north of Rome; and in the 1870-71 Franco-Prussian War when Garibaldi led an army against the Germans in eastern France.|$|E
25|$|As before, each assaulting brigade was {{assigned}} a full field company in support, 1/2nd and 2/1st to 137th Bde and 139th (Sherwood Forester) Brigade respectively. The 2/1st Fd Co allocated one party of sappers to 1/6th Bn Sherwood Foresters and three parties to the 1/7th (Robin Hood) Bn. The latter were to construct strongpoints in the captured German defences, while the party with 1/6th Bn was {{to stay in the}} German front line trench <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> work was required. In addition, small demolition parties were to advance with the Sherwood Foresters' bombing teams. The 1/2nd Fd Co was instructed to follow the final carrying parties of the supporting 1/5th Bn Leicestershire Regiment across No-Man's Land, and was thus less heavily engaged. No 2 Company, 5th Bn Special Brigade, RE, was also assigned to 46th Divisional RE to provide a smoke screen using trench mortars. The work was to be coordinated from a temporary RE HQ in a cellar in Fonquevillers.|$|E
25|$|While seen as {{an enemy}} of the United States and Colombian governments, Escobar was a hero to many in Medellín (especially the poor people). He was a natural at public relations, and he worked to create {{goodwill}} among the poor of Colombia. A lifelong sports fan, he was credited with building football fields and multi-sports courts, as well as sponsoring children's football teams. Escobar was also responsible for the construction of houses and football fields in western Colombia, which gained him popularity among the poor. He worked hard to cultivate his Robin Hood image, and frequently distributed money through housing projects and other civic activities, which gained him notable popularity among the locals of the towns that he frequented. Some people from Medellín often helped Escobar avoid police capture by serving as lookouts, hiding information from authorities, or <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> else they could to protect him. At the height of his power, drug traffickers from Medellín and other areas were handing over between 20% and 35% of their Colombian cocaine-related profits to Escobar, as {{he was the one who}} shipped cocaine successfully to the United States.|$|E

"My {{conception}} of punk", Perry told The Rocket, [...] "was <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> {{the hell you}} wanted {{as long as it}} had vitality and wasn't overly stupid...something exploratory and experimental", citing influence from genre-bending bands such as The Clash and the Meat Puppets. In their earliest incarnation, Mr. Wiggles played punk-inflected funk and soul music, though Perry's songwriting soon grew to draw heavily from a newfound interest in jazz, swing and rhythm and blues, combining punk rock and jazz arrangements in what Perry described was a desire to contemporize American roots music by infusing it with punk energy and using modernist, socially aware lyricism.|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} sessions {{ran from}} January to March 2005, {{with only two}} and a half weeks being spent on the acoustic record. Forty tracks were recorded – fifteen of them acoustic – with half of them ending on the final track list. Studio 606 was not finished as the band moved in, and the bandmembers even helped with the final stages of construction, [...] "hammering, stuffing insulation — <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> to speed the process." [...] Eight of the rock songs were last-minute compositions done after the acoustic record was finished, as [...] "Dave started feeling that it was better than the rock record." [...] The songs were recorded on analog tape—which was reused over and over due to a tape shortage and a desire to save money—before being transferred to Pro Tools for overdubs, editing and mixing. Raskulinecz mixed the rock songs, while Elliot Scheiner mixed the stereo and 5.1 versions of the acoustic sides.|$|E

Luna said [...] "that look on his face you see is perhaps a little disappointment in that he started to have a bond with someone he hasn’t killed.

Ben Rawson-Jones from Digital Spy describes Ben as a [...] "supposed villain", pondering [...] "Could he really have been the good guy all along" [...] following the fourth-season episode [...] "The Shape of Things to Come". Actor Michael Emerson suspects where Ben's loyalties lie will always be ambiguous, making this a [...] "wonderful role". He is rarely shown losing control of his emotions, but when he does, it is done in a big and childish way. Emerson explains [...] "He's cold because any trace of warmth makes him vulnerable to his enemies". Ben is also known for {{his commitment to the}} island and <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> is necessary to protect it. He has no qualms with Locke attempting to kill Naomi (Marsha Thomason) and even Jack after the survivors begin to call the freighter. He undertakes the risky and unpredictable step of moving the Island to prevent the freighter crew, and thus Charles Widmore, from finding it. He always has a plan and is described by Kevin Thompson from The Palm Beach Post as a [...] "know-it-all", which another reviewer thinks is because [...] " [...] talks quietly, in a menacingly measured drawl... with lots of pauses and emphases".|$|E

Caldwell commented on the pairing of Alex Shelley and Sean Waltman for the tournament, saying they were a [...] "natural fit working together" [...] and expressing hope that they would be a {{permanent}} fixture after the tournament concluded. Regarding the semifinal matches, Caldwell thought Sabin and Shocker versus Dutt and Killings was a [...] "solid match with a nice mini-storyline involving Sabin and Shocker having a miscommunication before settling their differences to win the match." [...] As for the finals, Caldwell stated that Shelley and Waltman versus Sabin and Shocker was a [...] "standard tag match" [...] but it was [...] "effective in telling the story of Waltman and Shelley <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> it takes to win while Shocker and Sabin continued to have differences that finally caused Shocker to go off." [...] Caldwell concluded by saying that [...] "Waltman and Shelley have impressed as a legit tag team since their first round match in the tournament," [...] going on to say that he hoped for a Waltman and Shelley victory at Unbreakable to [...] "give the tag division a fresh team to build around." ...|$|E
