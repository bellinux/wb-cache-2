Didanosine was approved by the FDA for the treatmentof HIV-1 in October 1991.Zalcitabine and didanosine are both obligate chain terminators, that have been developed for anti-HIV treatment. Unfortunately, both drugs lack selectivity and therefore cause side-effects.|$|E

That was 2´,3´-didehydro analogue of <b>dideoxyadenosine.</b> Insertion of a cyclopropyl group on its 6-amino nitrogen of the adenine ring increased lipophilicity and thus enhanced brain penetration.

Synthesis of caged alpha- 32 P-labelled <b>dideoxyadenosine</b> triphosphate (approx. 5000 Ci/mmol) in 85 % yield was achieved by a modification of the method used for the synthesis of the unlabelled compounds.

In the present study, we show that a lipophilic phosphoramidate pronucleotide derivative of <b>dideoxyadenosine,</b> 2 ′, 3 ′-ddA-PMAPh, exhibits enhanced activity as an inhibitor of EDHF-type smooth muscle hyperpolarizations induced by acetylcholine (ACh) compared to the parent nucleoside 2 ′, 3 ′-ddA, and {{that the effects of}} both compounds can be reversed by the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX. Neither 2 ′, 3 ′-ddA nor 2 ′, 3 ′-ddA-PMAPh depress ACh-evoked endothelial hyperpolarization directly.

40|$|Forward {{motility}} stimulating factor (FMSF), a glycoprotein {{isolated from}} buffalo serum, binds {{to the surface}} of the mature sperm cells to promote their progressive motility. This article reports the mode of signal transduction of this extracellular factor in goat sperm. The mechanism was investigated by assaying intracellular second messenger level and forward motility in presence of different pharmacological modulators. Mg++-dependent Forskolin responsive form of transmembrane adenylyl cyclase (tmAC) of goat spermatozoa was probed for its involvement in FMSF action. <b>Dideoxyadenosine,</b> a selective inhibitor of tmACs, was used to identify the role of this enzyme in the scheme of FMSF-signaling. Involvement of the a-subunit of G-protein in this regard has been inspected using GTPcS. Participation of protein kinase A (PKA) and tyrosine kinase was checked using IP 20 and genistein, respectively. FMSF promotes tmAC activity in a dose-dependent manner through receptor/G-protein activation to enhance intracellular cAMP and forward motility. Motility boosting effects of this glycoprotein are almost lost in presence of <b>dideoxyadenosine.</b> But, FMSF displayed substantial motility promoting activity when movement of spermatozoa was inhibited with KH 7, the specific inhibitor of soluble adenylyl cyclase indicating tmAC to be the primary target of FMSF action. Involvement of cAMP in mediating FMSF action was confirmed by the application of dibutyryl cAMP. Observed motility regulatory effects with IP 20 and genistein indicate contribution of PKA and tyrosine kinase in FMSF activity; enhanced phosphorylation of a tyrosine containing < 50 kD...|$|E
40|$|Angiotensin II (AII) stimulates {{capacitation}} and fertilizing {{ability in}} mammalian spermatozoa, with the binding of AII to its receptors resulting in stimulation of cAMP production in both uncapacitated and capacitated cells. This study investigated possible mechanisms whereby AII affects cAMP availability. The first {{question was whether}} extracellular Ca 21 is required for responses in mouse spermatozoa and, using chlortetracycline fluorescence analysis, {{it was clear that}} cells responded to AII only when the medium contained CaCl 2, with both 90 mM and 1. 80 mM supporting a significant acceleration of capacitation. Consistent with those results, AII significantly stimulated cAMP production in both CaCl 2 -containing media tested, the response being greater in that containing 1. 80 mM. Several different agents that might affect the signalling pathway stimulated by AII were then evaluated in uncapacitated suspensions. Chlortetracycline analysis revealed that pertussis toxin abolished responses to AII, suggesting the involvement of an inhibitory Ga subunit; <b>dideoxyadenosine,</b> a specific membrane-associated adenylyl cyclase (mAC) P-site inhibitor, also blocked responses, suggesting involvement of an mAC. cAMP determinations confirmed that both reagents also abolished AII’s stimulation of cAMP. In contrast, nifedipine, a Ca 21 channel blocker, did not inhibit AII’s effects on spermatozoa. Finally, in capacitated suspensions, both pertussis toxin and <b>dideoxyadenosine</b> were again shown to block AII’s stimulation of cAMP. These results suggest that responses to AII involve an inhibitory G protein and an mAC, but it is likely that AII–receptor coupling does not stimulate directly mAC but rather does so in an indirect manner, perhaps by altering the intracellular Ca 21 concentration.

40|$|Neuropeptide receptors couple via G-proteins to two {{principal}} signaling pathways that elevate cAMP through adenylate cyclase (AC) or mobilize intracellular Ca 2 � through phospholipase C (PLC) -stimulated inositol phosphate (IP) turnover {{and production of}} inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3). We showed previously that high-affinity receptors for pituitary adenylate cyclaseactivating polypeptide (PACAP) are present on chick ciliary ganglion neurons and that receptor occupation increases cAMP production, resulting in enhanced acetylcholine sensitivity. After we suppressed AC activity and cAMP production with 2 �- 5 � <b>dideoxyadenosine,</b> however, PACAP no longer increased acetylcholine sensitivity but instead reduced it, suggesting that an AC-independent signal pathway activated by PACAP inhibits some nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs).

40|$|Addition of the 3 -series {{fatty acid}} {{precursor}} (icosapentaenoic acid, IPA), its endoperoxide [prostaglandin (PG) H 3], or thromboxane A 3 to human platelet-rich plasma (PRP) does {{not result in}} aggregation of the platelets. In fact, preincubation of human PRP with exogenous PGH 3 actually inhibited aggregation by increasing platelet cyclic AMP concentrations. PGH 3 undergoes rapid spontaneous degradation to PGD 3 in human PRP. The PGD 3 so formed is adequate {{to account for the}} increase of platelet cAMP and inhibition of aggregation. Furthermore, addition of PGD-specific antisera to human PRP blocked the platelet inhibitory activity of exogenous PGH 3. PGD 3 has considerable potential as a circulating antithrombotic agent. Pretreatment of human PRP with the adenylate cyclase inhibitor 2 ′, 5 ′-dideoxyadenosine blocked the increase of platelet cyclic AMP and the inhibition of aggregation normally produced by PGI 2, PGE 1, PGD 2, PGH 3, and PGD 3. Furthermore, the <b>dideoxyadenosine</b> unmasked a direct but moderate reversible aggregatory effect in response to the subsequent addition of PGH 3. Similarly, the <b>dideoxyadenosine</b> markedly enhanced the aggregation produced by exogenous PGH 2. IPA is readily incorporated into tissue lipids but proved to be a poor substrate for kidney, blood vessel, or heart cyclooxygenase. IPA was previously shown to be a poor substrate for platelet cyclooxygenase. IPA is readily deacylated from the renal phospholipid pool in response to bradykinin, a substance that also stimulates the release of arachidonic acid. A diet that relies primarily on cold-water fish, {{as in the case of}} the Greenland Eskimos, lowers endogenous arachidonic acid and markedly increases the IPA content of tissue lipids. Thus, because IPA has the potential to act as an antagonist with arachidonic acid for platelet cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, the simultaneous release of IPA could suppress any residual arachidonic acid conversion to its aggregatory metabolites...|$|E

These drugs, azidothymidine (AZT), dideoxycytidine (ddC), and <b>dideoxyadenosine</b> (ddA), which are potent anti-HIV agents in CD 4 lymphocytes, did not inhibit HIV replication in MDM, even at concentrations of 100 microM. This drug concentration of AZT is approximately 100 -fold higher than the levels attained in the serum of treated patients and the levels required to inhibit HIV replication in lymphocytes.

40|$|Pollen tube {{growth and}} {{reorientation}} {{is a prerequisite}} for fertilization and seed formation. Here we report imaging of cAMP distribution in living pollen tubes microinjected with the protein kinase A-derived fluorosensor. Growing tubes revealed a uniform distribution of cAMP with a resting concentration of ≈ 100 – 150 nM. Modulators of adenylyl cyclase (AC), forskolin, and <b>dideoxyadenosine</b> could alter these values. Transient elevations in the apical region could be correlated with changes in the tube-growth axis, suggesting a role for cAMP in polarized growth. Changes in cAMP arise through the activity of a putative AC identified in pollen. This signaling protein shows homology to functional motifs in fungal AC. Expression of the cDNA in Escherichia coli resulted in cAMP increase and complemented a catabolic defect in the fermentation of carbohydrates caused by the absence of cAMP in a cyaA mutant.

The nucleotides ATP, ADP and AMP appear to act by being converted to adenosine. The rank order of inhibitory potency of the synthetic analogues indicates that these compounds act at an extracellular A 2 /Ra purinoceptor. The xanthines, 1, 3 -diethyl- 8 -phenylxanthine, 8 -phenyltheophylline and theophylline antagonized the inhibitory action of N-ethyl-carboxamideadenosine competitively. Theobromine was inactive. This supports the view that the inhibitory receptor is of the A/R type.

40|$|Evidence {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) replication both in the skin Langerhans' cells of AIDS patients (Tschachler et al., 1987) and in normal, peripheral blood dendritic cells (DC) (Patterson & Knight, 1987; Knight & Patterson, 1989) suggests that infection of these antigen-presenting cells {{may contribute to the}} immunosuppression seen in AIDS. Support for this hypothesis is now provided by experiments in which the capacity of DC infected in vitro to present mitogen to normal syngeneic lymphocytes was measured. Infecting DC with HIV before culturing with lymphocytes inhibited mitogen-stimulated cell proliferation. Viral DNA was detected in DC in these cultures by in situ hybridization but, in addition, HIV was also present in a small proportion of lymphocytes. However, introducing an inhibitor of virus replication, 2 ', 3 ' <b>dideoxyadenosine,</b> after infection of the DC but before culturing with lymphocytes, blocked growth of HIV in lymphocytes. In these latter experiments mitogen proliferation responses were still suppressed.

40|$|Mechanisms of insulin-stimulated electrogenic sodium transport. Studies were {{performed}} to determine the signal transduction mechanism involved in the onset of insulin stimulated electrogenic sodium transport (Ieq) in cultured A 6 cells. Insulin stimulated Ieq at a threshold concentration of one nM and a half-maximum concentration of approximately 3 nM. The onset of action occurred within 10 seconds {{and the increase in}} Ieq was augmented by pretreatment with aldosterone, similar to the action of vasopressin. Insulin stimulated an increase in Cai 2 + in a dose-dependent manner that involved release from intracellular stores. Hormone stimulated Ieq was dependent on increases in Cai 2 + because pretreatment with 5, 5 ′ dimethyl BAPTA/AM blocked the increase in sodium transport. further studies with dihydroxyclorpromazine, trifluoperazine and genistein, inhibitors of PKC, Cai 2 + dependent, calmodulin dependent kinases and tyrosine kinase, respectively, suggested that the action of insulin was dependent on activation of these kinases. In contrast, insulin stimulated Ieq was independent of changes in cAMP, because insulin did not increase the accumulation of cAMP, and inhibition of adenylate cyclase with 2 ′, 5 ′ <b>dideoxyadenosine</b> did not affect transport.

As {{in the original}} protocol, the sequencing reaction uses modified T 7 polymerase with manganese rather than magnesium to produce very uniform incorporation of each dideoxynucleoside. To improve sequencing accuracy, two fluorescently labeled primers are employed in separate sequencing reactions. As an example, one sequencing reaction uses a FAM-labeled primer with <b>dideoxyadenosine</b> triphosphate and dideoxycytosine triphosphate; the concentrations of ddATP and ddCTP are adjusted to produce a 2 : 1 variation in the relative intensity of fragments. The second sequencing reaction uses a TAMRA labeled primer with dideoxythymidine triphosphate and dideoxyguanidine triphosphate; the concentrations of ddTTP and ddGTP are adjusted to produce a 2 : 1 variation in relative intensity of fragments. The pooled reaction products are separated by capillary gel electrophoresis and identified by one of three different detector systems. Use of a 2 : 1 peak height ratio typically produces a sequencing accuracy of 97. 5 % for the first 350 bases; a 3 : 1 peak height ratio improves accuracy to 99. 5 % for the first 400 bases.

The 50 % inhibitory concentrations for dideoxyguanosine, <b>dideoxyadenosine,</b> and dideoxycytidine were 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 3 microM, respectively. In contrast, weak inhibition was produced by 100 microM dideoxythymidine.

The interaction of visna virus reverse transcriptase with several inhibitors was also examined. Reverse transcriptase was inhibited by phosphonoformate, ribavirin 5 '-triphosphate, ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, and ddTTP. The last four compounds inhibited incorporation of homologous 2 '-deoxynucleoside 5 '-triphosphates into polynucleotides by a competitive mechanism. In view of the biological similarities between visna virus and HIV and the similar in vitro susceptibility of visna virus replication to known inhibitors of HIV, visna virus may provide a good model for studying the inhibition of HIV replication in vitro.

Antimicrobial effects occurred over a broad range of concentra-tions including the physiological (picomolar) range. Small concentrations of a-MSH peptides likewise reduced viability and germ tube formation of the yeast C. albicans. Antimicrobial influences of a-MSH peptides could be mediated by their capac-ity to increase cellular cAMP. Indeed, this messen-ger was significantly augmented in peptide-treated yeast and the potent adenylyl cyclase inhibitor <b>dideoxyadenosine</b> (ddAdo) partly reversed the kill-ing activity of a-MSH peptides. Reduced killing of pathogens is a detrimental consequence of therapy with anti-inflammatory drugs. Because a-MSH has potent anti-inflammatory effects we determined influences of a-MSH on C. albicans and S. aureus killing by human neutrophils. a-MSH peptides did not reduce killing but rather enhanced it, likely {{as a consequence of the}} direct antimicrobial activity. a-MSH peptides that combine antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects could be useful in treatment of disorders in which infection and inflammation coexist.

Dideoxyguanosine (ddG) caused reproducible, progressive telomere shortening over several weeks of passaging, after which the telomeres stabilized and remained short. However, the prolonged passaging in ddG caused no observable effects on cell population doubling rates or morphology. Azidothymidine (AZT) caused progressive telomere shortening in some but not all T- and B-cell cultures. Telomerase activity was present in both cell lines and was inhibited in vitro by ddGTP and AZT triphosphate. Prolonged passaging in arabinofuranyl-guanosine, dideoxyinosine (ddI), <b>dideoxyadenosine</b> (ddA), didehydrothymidine (d 4 T), or phosphonoformic acid (foscarnet) did not cause reproducible telomere shortening or decreased cell growth rates or viabilities. Combining AZT, foscarnet, and/or arabinofuranyl-guanosine with ddG did not significantly augment the effects of ddG alone. Strikingly, with or without inhibitors, telomere lengths were often highly unstable in both cell lines and varied between parallel cell cultures.

Using cultured SMC from rabbit thoracic aorta, we demonstrated that PGI 2, 6 -keto-PGF 1 alpha, and 6 -keto-PGE 1 enhanced ACEH activity fourfold. No significant effects on ACEH activity were observed with PGE 1 or PGE 2. Preincubation of SMC with an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase activity (<b>dideoxyadenosine)</b> abolished {{the effect of these}} PG on CE hydrolytic activity. Addition of dibutyryl cAMP to these SMC significantly increased ACEH activity. Although concentrations of PGI 2 used significantly increased cAMP levels, proliferation of these SMC was not observed.

A significant loss of total cholesterol from PG-treated SMC was observed at the end of 14 d.

We studied the effect of plasma from patients with INS on mesangial cell cAMP. We also determined mesangial cell HS when cAMP levels were modified using a cationic membrane after metabolic labeling. Cellular cAMP levels increased significantly when mesangial cells were incubated with plasma from patients with INS in comparison with control plasma (+ 77 %, P = 0. 01). Forskolin and IBMX, which increased cellular cAMP, decreased HS levels (- 21 +/- 9 % and - 15 +/- 6 % respectively, P < 0. 05 for both), whereas <b>dideoxyadenosine,</b> which decreased cellular cAMP, increased HS levels (+ 24 +/- 7 %, P < 0. 05). Plasma from patients with INS decreased glomerular cell HS in comparison with control plasma (- 34 +/- 8 %, P < 0, 05). This effect was abolished when cells were preincubated with ddAdo to prevent an increase in cAMP levels. We conclude that in mesangial cells, plasma from patients with INS increases cAMP levels, and that cAMP mediates a decrease in HS levels. Moreover, the action of plasma from patients on HS was inhibited when an increase in cAMP was prevented. cAMP may therefore be instrumental in the negative effect of the plasma factor on mesangial cell HS...|$|E
40|$|Recordings {{from the}} soma of the {{cockroach}} (Periplaneta americana) fast coxal depressor motoneuron (Df) were made while acetylcholine (ACh) was regularly pressure-applied locally from a micropipette. The modulatory effects upon these nicotinic ACh responses of bath-applied 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT, serotonin), dopamine and octopamine were investigated under either current-clamp or voltage-clamp conditions. The biogenic amines reversibly suppressed, but never totally abolished, ACh responses, 5 -HT {{being the most}} potent, with a threshold near 10 (- 6) m (EC 50 = 5 x 10 (- 5) m). Occlusion experiments indicate that the amines share a common mechanism {{at the level of}} either receptors or second messenger pathways. The amines also modulated responses to nicotine or carbachol (each of which resists hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterases), indicating that the amines did not act by accelerating ACh degradation. Pharmacological antagonists were used in an attempt to characterize the receptor responsible for amine-mediated modulation. Although a number of antagonists mimicked the action of amines rather than producing blockade, the antagonistic actions of LSD and RS 23597 pointed strongly to a receptor-mediated mechanism, but did not allow receptor identification. The magnitude of the modulatory effect of 5 -HT was significantly reduced by intracellular guanosine- 5 '-O-(2 -thiodiphosphate) (GDP-beta-S), indicating involvement of a G-protein. Intracellular injection of the calcium chelator BAPTA did not block the modulatory effect of 5 -HT, showing that the amines do not operate through the calcium-dependent pathway by which muscarinic receptors act on nicotinic currents. The adenylate cyclase inhibitor <b>dideoxyadenosine</b> (DDA), on the other hand, did attenuate the action of 5 -HT, suggesting involvement of cyclic AMP...|$|E
40|$|Adenosine {{stimulation}} of Na+ transport by an A 1 receptor and a [Ca 2 +]i-dependent mechanism. Studies {{were performed to}} determine the primary signal transduction mechanism that mediates adenosine {{stimulation of}} electrogenic sodium transport in renal epithelial cells. Experiments were performed on cultured amphibian A 6 cells with an adenosine analogue that preferentially binds to the A 1 receptor, cyclohexyladenosine (CHA). Sodium transport was assessed by the equivalent short circuit current (Ieq). CHA was found to stimulate Ieq via activation of an A 1 receptor because (1) the threshold concentration was 1 nM {{compared to that of}} 10 µM for the specific A 2 agonist CGS 21680, (2) CHA inhibited vasopressin (AVP) -stimulated cAMP production by a pertussis toxinsensitive mechanism, and (3) the action of CHA was inhibited by the A 1 antagonist 1, 3 -dipropyl- 8 -cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX). CHA increased intracellular Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) and stimulated phosphoinositide turnover at concentrations that increased Ieq and in a time course that paralleled the increase in Ieq. Ion transport was stimulated by a Ca 2 +-dependent mechanism because the CHA induced increase in Ieq was inhibited by chelating [Ca 2 +]i with 5, 5 ′dimethyl BAPTA in a dose-dependent manner, with a Ki of approximately 10 µM. The increase in Ieq was also dose-dependently inhibited by the specific PKC inhibitors dihydroxychlorpromazine and chelerythrine, and by trifluoperazine which inhibits PKC and calmodulin. Further studies indicated that CHA-stimulated Ieq was independent of cAMP generation because CHA did not induce an increase in cAMP accummulation parallel to the increase in Ieq in a dose-response analysis, and the adenylate cyclase inhibitor 2 ′, 5 ′ <b>dideoxyadenosine</b> (DDA) did not affect the CHA-induced increase in Ieq. These studies indicate, therefore, that adenosine stimulation of Ieq occurs, at least in part, through calcium-dependent signal transduction events and not through regulation of adenylate cyclase...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which DNA polymerase I enzymes function {{has been the subject}} of extensive biochemical and structural studies. We previously determined the structure of a ternary complex of the large fragment of DNA polymerase I from Thermus aquaticus (Klentaq 1) bound to a primer/template DNA and a dideoxycytidine 5 ′-triphosphate (ddCTP). In this report, we present the details of the 2. 3 -Å resolution crystal structures of three additional ternary complexes of Klentaq 1 bound to a primer/template DNA and a dideoxyguanosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ddGTP), a dideoxythymidine 5 ′-triphosphate (ddTTP), or a <b>dideoxyadenosine</b> 5 ′-triphosphate (ddATP). Comparison of the active site of the four ternary complexes reveals that the protein residues around the nascent base pair (that formed between the incoming dideoxynucleoside triphosphate [ddNTP] and the template base) form a snug binding pocket into which only a correct Watson-Crick base pair can fit. Except in the ternary complex bound to dideoxyguanosine 5 ′-triphosphate, there are no sequence specific contacts between the protein side chains and the nascent base pair, suggesting that steric constraints imposed by the protein onto the nascent base pair is the major contributor to nucleotide selectivity at the polymerase active site. The protein around the polymerase active site also shows plasticity, which may be responsible for the substrate diversity of the enzyme. Two conserved side chains, Q 754 and R 573, form hydrogen bonds with the N 3 atom in the purine base and O 2 atom in the pyrimidine base at the minor groove side of the base pair formed by the incorporated ddNMP and the corresponding template base in all the four ternary complexes. These hydrogen-bonding interactions may provide a means of detecting misincorporation at this position...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} 1 -deazaadenine nucleosides with the N 6 {{nitrogen}} unsubstituted or bearing methyl or cycloalkyl substituents, {{with or without}} a chloro group in the 2 -position, and with the glycosylic moiety being ribose (1 - 16) 2 ’-deoxyribose (17 - 32), or 2 ’, 3 ’-dideoxyribose (33 - 48) were designed and synthesized starting from 5, 7 -dichloro- 3 H-imidazo[4, 5 -blpyridine (50). These compounds were evaluated for their in vitro activity against human immunodeficiency virus type- 1 (HIV- 1) and herpes simplex virus type- 1 (HSV- 1). In addition they were tested for their ability to inhibit adenosine deaminase (ADA) from calf intestine. While the parent compounds 1 -deazaadenosine(9), 2 ’-deoxy- 1 -deazaadenosine (25), and 2 ’, 3 ’-dideoxy- 1 -deazaadenosin(41) and the corresponding 2 -chloro derivatives were inactive, nucleosides bearing cycloalkyl substituents on N 6 exhibited moderate to good anti-HIV- 1 activity, compared to 2 ’, 3 ’- <b>dideoxyadenosine,</b> with the degree and pattern of improvement depending on the structure of the sugar moiety. In general, 2 ’-deoxy- and 2 ’, 3 ’-dideoxy derivatives were more potent compounds than the corresponding ribose nucleosides. Compounds bearing a 6 -cycloheptyl or cyclooctylamine were the most active in every series. The presence of a chloro group in the 2 -position improved both activity and therapeutic index in every series, the most active compound being 2 ’-deoxy- 2 -chloro-N 6 -cycloheptyl- 1 -deazaadenosi ne(23; ED 50 = 0. 2 microM). On the other hand, most of these derivatives were inactive as anti-HSV- 1 agents, showing a high degree of virus selectivity. The 1 -deazaadenine derivatives were not substrates of adenosine deaminase, and some of them proved to be good inhibitors of the enzyme. However, the ADA inhibitory activity does not account for the antiviral potency since increased lipophilicity and steric hindrance of substituents resulted in derivatives much less active than the parent compounds...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{recognized}} that brainstem microinjections of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5 -HT) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) act synergistically to stimulate gastric function in vivo. Previous in vitro experiments {{have shown that}} this synergism does not occur {{at the level of}} the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) motoneurone. In order to determine the mechanism of this action, whole cell patch clamp recordings were made from identified gastric-projecting rat DMV neurones to investigate the effects of 5 -HT and TRH on GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) evoked by stimulation of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS). 5 -HT (30 μM) decreased IPSC amplitude by 26 ± 2. 5 % in approximately 43 % of DMV neurones. In the remaining neurones in which 5 -HT had no effect on IPSC amplitude, exposure to TRH (1 μM) uncovered the ability of subsequent applications of 5 -HT to decrease IPSC amplitude by 28 ± 3 %. Such TRH-induced 5 -HT responses were prevented by the 5 -HT 1 A antagonist NAN- 190 (1 μM) and mimicked by the 5 -HT 1 A agonist 8 -OH-DPAT (1 μM). Increasing cAMP levels using the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX; 10 μM), the non-hydrolysable cAMP analogue 8 -bromo-cAMP (1 mM), or the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (10 μM), like TRH, uncovered the ability of 5 -HT to decrease evoked IPSC amplitude (17 ± 2. 2 %, 28. 5 ± 5. 3 % and 30 ± 4. 8 %, respectively), in neurones previously unresponsive to 5 -HT. Conversely, the adenylate cyclase inhibitor, <b>dideoxyadenosine</b> (10 μM) and the protein kinase A inhibitor, Rp-cAMP (10 μM), blocked the ability of TRH to uncover the presynaptic inhibitory actions of 5 -HT. These results suggest that activation of presynaptic TRH receptors initiates an intracellular signalling cascade that raises the levels of cAMP sufficient to uncover previously silent 5 -HT 1 A receptors on presynaptic nerve terminals within the dorsal vagal complex...|$|E
40|$|Doering, Alice McGovern (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia), Miekie Jansen, and Seymour S. Cohen. Polymer {{synthesis}} in killed bacteria: lethality of 2 ′, 3 ′-dideoxyadenosine. J. Bacteriol. 92 : 565 – 574. 1966. —We {{studied the}} metabolic capabilities of cells {{that had lost}} the ability to multiply under a variety of lethal treatments. Cultures of a polyauxotrophic mutant of Escherichia coli strain 15 requiring thymine, arginine, uracil, and adenine for growth were killed to a few per cent survivors by several different methods. These treatments included streptomycin, thymineless death, d-arabinosyladenine (ara-A), and 2 ′, 3 ′-dideoxyadenosine (DDA). The killed cells were washed and supplied with complete media, and were compared with control cells with respect to the ability to incorporate thymine, arginine, and uracil. Cells killed with streptomycin in the absence of thymine were only partially inhibited in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis; they were markedly inhibited in synthesis of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein. Cells that had suffered thymineless death were essentially uninhibited in DNA synthesis, partially so in RNA synthesis, but extensively inhibited in protein synthesis. Killing by ara-A did not prevent DNA synthesis, but markedly inhibited RNA and protein synthesis. The lethality of DDA was studied in the presence of exogenous adenosine; lethality was partially prevented by deoxyadenosine. <b>Dideoxyadenosine</b> was similar to ara-A and thymineless death in killing in a pattern in which RNA and protein synthesis continued while DNA synthesis was inhibited. Cells killed by DDA, however, were markedly inhibited in subsequent thymine incorporation, unlike cells killed by the other methods. In addition, at this time, the DDA-killed cells were more inhibited in incorporation of arginine than of uracil. DDA also potentiated thymineless death; when cells were killed rapidly by the combined treatment, only the ability to synthesize DNA was lost irreversibly. This agent (DDA) may permit the detailed study in E. coli of the relation of DNA synthesis to numerous phenomena, such as genetic recombination, sequential transcription, and the number and distribution of chromosome breaks...|$|E
40|$|Regulation of the renal Na-HCO 3 cotransporter: V. Mechanism of the {{inhibitory}} effect of parathyroid hormone. PTH administration decreases proximal HCO 3 reabsorption and inhibits the brush border Na-H anti-porter. We studied {{the effect of}} PTH on the renal Na-HCO 3 cotransporter and examined whether this effect is mediated through the adenylate cyclase/cyclic AMP system or through the phospholipase A pathway. We studied the effect of PTH [1 – 34] on the Na-HCO 3 cotransporter activity in rabbit renal basolateral membranes incubated with 50 µm ATP by measuring the 22 Na uptake {{in the presence of}} HCO 3 and gluconate. Na-HCO 3 cotransporter activity (expressed in nmol/mg protein/ 3 seconds) was taken as the difference in 22 Na uptake in the presence of HCO 3 and gluconate. PTH (10 - 10 m) completely inhibited Na-HCO 3 cotransporter activity from 1. 23 ± 0. 14 to - 0. 58 ± 0. 23, P < 0. 001. This effect of PTH to inhibit the Na-HCO 3 cotransporter was prevented by the polyclonal antibody against Gαs indicating that PTH acts through Gαs protein. Because Gas stimulates adenylate cyclase/cyclic AMP system, we examined the effect of PTH in the presence {{and in the absence of}} the adenylate cyclase inhibitor, <b>dideoxyadenosine</b> (DDA). DDA alone (10 - 4 m) stimulated the Na-HCO 3 cotransporter activity. In the presence of DDA, the net {{inhibitory effect}} of PTH was the same magnitude as that of control, suggesting the existence of other pathways for the effect of PTH on the cotransporter. Calmodulin inhibition also partially prevented the effect of PTH. To determine whether the inhibitory effect of PTH is mediated at least in part, through phospholipase A, we first examined the effect of PTH on arachidonic acid release and then measured the Na-HCO 3 cotransporter activity in presence and in absence of arachidonic acid or eicosatetraynoic acid (ETA), an inhibitor of arachidonic acid metabolism. PTH significantly increased the release of arachidonic acid by isolated proximal tubule cells and arachidonic acid inhibited the Na-HCO 3 cotransporter in basolateral membranes. ETA (3 µm) partially prevented the inhibitory effect of PTH. In cultured proximal tubule cells, PTH inhibited the HCO 3 -dependent 22 Na uptake and ethoxyresorufin, an inhibitor of cytochrome P [...] 450, blocked the inhibitory effect of PTH on the cotransporter. These results demonstrate that PTH inhibits the renal Na-HCO 3 cotransporter through multiple mechanisms, that are mediated through G proteins, Gαs and GP, and CaM-KII...|$|E
