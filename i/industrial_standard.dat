25|$|Ruby 1.8 {{has been}} the subject of several {{industry}} standards. The language specifications for Ruby were developed by the Open Standards Promotion Center of the Information-Technology Promotion Agency (a Japanese government agency) for submission to the Japanese Industrial Standards Committee (JISC) and then to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It was accepted as a Japanese <b>Industrial</b> <b>Standard</b> (JIS X 3017) in 2011 and an international standard (ISO/IEC 30170) in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{technique to}} measure oil concentration in cutting fluid samples is manual titration: 100ml of the fluid under test is titrated with a 0.5M HCl solution to an endpoint of pH 4 and {{the volume of}} titrant used to reach the endpoint {{is used to calculate}} the oil concentration. This technique is accurate and not affected by fluid contamination, but needs to be performed by trained personnel in a laboratory environment. A hand-held refractometer is the <b>industrial</b> <b>standard</b> used to determine the mix ratio of water-soluble coolants that estimates oil concentration from the sample refractive index measured in the Brix scale. The refractometer allows for in situ measurements of oil concentration within industrial plants. However, contamination of the sample reduces the accuracy of the measure. Other techniques are used to measure the oil concentration in cutting fluids, such as measure of the fluid viscosity, density, and ultrasound speed. Other test equipment is used to determine such properties as acidity and conductivity.|$|E

25|$|Thai <b>Industrial</b> <b>Standard</b> (TIS) 166-2547 and its {{subsequent}} update TIS 166-2549 replaced prior standards which {{were based on}} NEMA 1-15 and 5-15, as Thailand uses 220 V electricity. The plug has two round power pins 4.8mm in diameter and 19mm in length, insulated for 10mm and spaced 19mm apart, with an earthing pin of the same diameter and 21.4mm in length, located 11.89mm from the line connecting the two power pins. The earth pin spacing corresponds to that of NEMA 5 and provides compatibility with prior hybrid three-pin sockets, which accept NEMA 1-15, NEMA 5-15 and Europlugs, {{all of which have}} been variably used in Thailand. The hybrid socket is also defined in TIS 166-2547, in addition to a plain three-round-pin socket, with plans to replace the former and phase out support for NEMA-compatible plugs. Sockets are polarised (as in NEMA 5-15). The plug is similar to, but not interchangeable with, the Israeli SI32 plug. The Thai plug has not been designated with a letter code at IEC World Plugs.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, in 1934, Zworykin shared some patent rights with the German {{licensee}} company Telefunken. The [...] "image iconoscope" [...] ("Superikonoskop" [...] in Germany) was produced {{as a result}} of the collaboration. This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron. The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and image iconoscope in Europe were not affected by the patent war between Zworykin and Farnsworth, because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image dissector, having submitted a patent application for their Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher (Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television) in Germany in 1925, two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States. The image iconoscope (Superikonoskop) became the <b>industrial</b> <b>standard</b> for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the vidicon and plumbicon tubes. Indeed, it was the representative of the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the image orthicon. The German company Heimann produced the Superikonoskop for the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, later Heimann also produced and commercialized it from 1940 to 1955, finally the Dutch company Philips produced and commercialized the image iconoscope and multicon from 1952 to 1958.|$|E
