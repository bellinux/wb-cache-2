In 1987 EastEnders was responsible for screening the first ever gay kiss in a UK soap opera, much to the outrage of the viewing public. A small kiss on the forehead, given to Barry from Colin, received a record number of complaints from angry viewers. In addition, the right-wing British press reacted with fury. They began a smear campaign, branding the programme 'filth' and, for a while, dubbed the show EastBenders. There were even questions in parliament about whether it was appropriate to have gay men in a family show when AIDS was sweeping the country.|$|E

Peter Marsh for the BBC's experimental music review referred to the album as [...] "now one of those albums that's spoken about <b>in</b> <b>hushed,</b> reverential tones as a proto-ambient classic". Dominique Leone of the music webzine Pitchfork Media noted that [...] "to [...] and Eno's credit, it didn't really sound like anything that had come before it".|$|E
2500|$|Before the 20th century, {{breast cancer}} was feared and {{discussed}} <b>in</b> <b>hushed</b> tones, {{as if it}} were shameful. [...] As little could be safely done with primitive surgical techniques, women tended to suffer silently rather than seeking care. [...] When surgery advanced, and long-term survival rates improved, women began raising awareness of the disease and the possibility of successful treatment. [...] The [...] "Women's Field Army", run by the American Society for the Control of Cancer (later the American Cancer Society) during the 1930s and 1940s {{was one of the first}} organized campaigns. In 1952, the first peer-to-peer support group, called [...] "Reach to Recovery", began providing post-mastectomy, in-hospital visits from women who had survived breast cancer.|$|E

2500|$|Critic Stephanie Zacharek of Salon {{states that}} [...] "this {{adaptation}} of Cormac McCarthy's novel touches on brutal themes, but never really gets its hands dirty. The movie's violence isn't pulpy and visceral, {{the kind of}} thing that hits like a fist; it's brutal, and rather relentless, but there are still several layers of comfortable distance between it and us. At one point a character lifts his cowboy boot, daintily, so it won't be mussed by the pool of blood gathering at his feet ... The Coens have often used cruel violence to make their points– that's nothing new– but putting that violence to work in the service of allegedly deep themes isn't the same as actually getting your hands dirty. No Country for Old Men feels less like a breathing, thinking movie than an exercise. That may be partly because it's an adaptation of a book by a contemporary author who's usually spoken of <b>in</b> <b>hushed,</b> respectful, hat-in-hand tones, as if he were a schoolmarm who'd finally brought some sense and order to a lawless town." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} and middle of the 20th century, breast cancer was usually discussed <b>in</b> <b>hushed</b> tones, {{as if it were}} shameful. As an example, the New York Times refused to publish an advertisement for a breast cancer support group in the early 1950s, stating that it would not print either the word [...] "breast" [...] or the word [...] "cancer". Later, however, several celebrities publicly disclosed their own health challenges, and the resulting publicity reduced the stigma. One of the first was Shirley Temple Black, the former child star, who announced her diagnosis in 1972. In October 1974, Betty Ford, the wife of the then-President of the United States, openly discussed her breast cancer diagnosis and mastectomy. Two weeks later, the wife of the then-Vice President also had a mastectomy for breast cancer. The next year, journalist Rose Kushner published her book, Breast Cancer: A Personal History and Investigative Report, which she had written while recovering from a modified radical mastectomy. The media reported these women's health and their treatment choices, and even invited some to appear on talk shows to discuss breast cancer frankly.|$|E
