5|$|Military failure abroad, and the {{associated}} <b>fiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> of constant campaigns, led to political discontent at home. The problems {{came to a head}} in the parliament of 1376, the so-called Good Parliament. The parliament was called to grant taxation, but the House of Commons took the opportunity to address specific grievances. In particular, criticism was directed at some of the king's closest advisors. Chamberlain William Latimer and Steward of the Household John Neville were dismissed from their positions. Edward's mistress, Alice Perrers, who was seen to hold far too much power over the ageing king, was banished from court. Yet the real adversary of the Commons, supported by powerful men such as Wykeham and Edmund de Mortimer, Earl of March, was John of Gaunt. Both the king and the Black Prince were by this time incapacitated by illness, leaving Gaunt in virtual control of government. Gaunt was forced to give in to the demands of parliament, but at its next convocation, in 1377, most of the achievements of the Good Parliament were reversed.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the <b>fiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> on {{the kingdom}} caused by Edward's {{expensive}} alliances led to discontent at home. The regency council {{at home was}} frustrated by the mounting national debt, while the king and his commanders on the Continent were angered {{by the failure of}} the government in England to provide sufficient funds. To deal with the situation, Edward himself returned to England, arriving in London unannounced on 30 November 1340. Finding the affairs of the realm in disorder, he purged the royal administration of a great number of ministers and judges. These measures did not bring domestic stability, and a stand-off ensued between the king and John de Stratford, Archbishop of Canterbury, during which Stratford's relatives Robert Stratford Bishop of Chichester and Henry de Stratford were temporarily stripped of title and imprisoned respectively. Stratford claimed that Edward had violated the laws of the land by arresting royal officers. A certain level of conciliation was reached at the parliament of April 1341. Here Edward was forced to accept severe limitations to his financial and administrative freedom, in return for a grant of taxation. Yet in October the same year, the king repudiated this statute and Archbishop Stratford was politically ostracised. The extraordinary circumstances of the April parliament had forced the king into submission, but under normal circumstances the powers of the king in medieval England were virtually unlimited, a fact that Edward was able to exploit.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "State and local governments work {{in partnership with the}} federal government to implement numerous intergovernmental programs. <b>Fiscal</b> <b>pressures</b> for state and local governments may exist when spending is expected to outpace revenues for the long term. GAO was asked to examine (1) the long-term <b>fiscal</b> <b>pressures</b> facing state and local governments and historical spending and revenue trends, (2) spending and revenue trends to identify patterns among states, and (3) what is known about the implications of these <b>fiscal</b> <b>pressures</b> for federal policies. Using aggregate data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis's National Income and Product Accounts, this analysis draws on results from the March 2010 update to GAO's state and local government fiscal model. GAO's model uses historical data to simulate expenditures and revenues for the sector for the next 50 years. Data from the U. S. Census Bureau are used to analyze patterns of state and local government expenditures and revenues among the states from 1977 to 2007, the most recent 30 -year period for which these data were available. A review of GAO and other reports synthesizes what is known about the implications of these long-term <b>fiscal</b> <b>pressures</b> for future federal policies. ...|$|R
40|$|State {{and local}} governments {{nationwide}} faced growing <b>fiscal</b> <b>pressures</b> in the early 1990 s as the economy first moved into recession and then began a slow recovery. In response to these pressures, governments increased tax rates, expanded tax bases, added new taxes, accelerated tax collections, and increased fees and charges. They also made across-the-board spending cuts, laid off employees, postponed capital projects, and delayed payments to vendors. 1 In some instances, state governments reduced their fiscal problems by shifting funding responsibilities to local governments. For example, California shifted K- 12 education costs to local governments (NCSL 1993, p. 13). <b>Fiscal</b> <b>pressures</b> are now subsiding, mainl...|$|R

25|$|In his {{religious}} and laic constructions, Brâncoveanu harmoniously combined in architecture the mural and sculptural painting, the local tradition, the Neo-Byzantine {{style and the}} innovative ideas of the Italian Renaissance, giving rise to Brâncovenesc style. The most accomplished and the best preserved example of Brâncovenesc style architecture is Hurezi monastery, inscribed by UNESCO on its list of World Heritage Sites, where Brâncoveanu intended to have his tomb. Other buildings erected by him are Mogoşoaia Palace complex, Potlogi Palace, Brâncoveanu monastery. Such cultural ventures relied on increased taxation, which was also determined by the mounting <b>fiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> of the Ottomans (adding in turn to Brâncoveanu's determination to strip Wallachia of Turkish rule).|$|E

2500|$|The 1920s saw {{the rising}} {{antisemitism}} {{and the increasing}} strength of the Nazi Party in Germany. Danzig was closely tied to Germany, from which it was officially separated by the Treaty of Versailles, and it became an increasingly unpleasant place for Jews, particularly after March 1933, when the local Nazi party won control of the city government. The synagogue thereafter was a target of two arson attempts. Both were stopped by a local militia formed by the local Jewish population to protect the building {{in concert with the}} Danzig police, who feared that any negligence of the attacks on Jews would lead to a Polish intervention. While the Constitution of the Free City of Danzig offered Danzig Jews greater protection than their brethren in Germany, Nazi sympathizers invaded the synagogue in August 1938 and trampled the Torah scrolls. The communities' leaders decided to safeguard some of their relics – the archives were shipped to Jerusalem, the library to Vilnius, and the museum to the United States. At the same time, mounting <b>fiscal</b> <b>pressure</b> forced the synagogue to sell the organs to Kraków, candlesticks to Warsaw, and the benches to Nowy Port. This was not enough, and in early 1939 the synagogue was sold to the senate of Danzig. On 15 April 1939, the last service was held in the building, and soon thereafter the senate took control. A banner was hung on a fence surrounding the building with the text: [...] "Come, lovely May, and free us from the Jews". On 2 May, the Nazi-dominated government began demolishing the building.|$|E
