5|$|Australia {{defeated}} South Africa 4–0 {{and senior}} {{players such as}} Bill O'Reilly were pointed in their comments about the enjoyment of playing under Richardson's captaincy. A group of players who were openly hostile toward Bradman formed during the tour. For some, the prospect of playing under Bradman was daunting, as was the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would additionally be sitting in judgement of their abilities {{in his role as}} a selector.|$|E
5|$|Alberto Contador {{rode the}} Giro with full <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{to answer to}} the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) {{regarding}} his positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, since his national federation cleared him of doping charges but both the UCI and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) chose to appeal the ruling. He rode and won with the most dominant Grand Tour performance of his career, and later rode a relatively normal and full 2011 season as his CAS date was continually pushed back. It was originally scheduled for June, to occur soon enough to decide conclusively his status prior to the 2011 Tour de France, but it was instead pushed back to August and then again to November.|$|E
5|$|Musidora: The Bather 'At the Doubtful Breeze Alarmed, {{also known}} as The Bather, is a name given to four nearly {{identical}} oil paintings on canvas by English artist William Etty. The paintings illustrate a scene from James Thomson's 1727 poem Summer in which a young man accidentally sees a young woman bathing naked, and is torn between his desire to look and his <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ought to look away. The scene was popular with English artists as {{it was one of}} the few legitimate pretexts to paint nudes at a time when the display and distribution of nude imagery was suppressed.|$|E

I'm so {{unlikely}} to cross his path again <b>that</b> <b>he</b> talked with unusual frankness to me--or at me, if you prefer to put it that way. All I gained last night was the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> afraid of himself, that his temper cost him a career in the world and obliged him to live in seclusion and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has a secret which he doesn't intend any red-headed girl to stumble on accidentally." ...|$|R

5|$|Captain Scarlet becomes Spectrum's {{foremost}} {{weapon in}} its {{fight against the}} Mysterons after {{the events of the}} pilot episode, in which the Mysterons threaten to assassinate the World President as their first act of retaliation. The original Captain Scarlet is {{killed in a car accident}} engineered by the Mysterons and replaced with a re-created Mysteron likeness. However, when the Captain Scarlet duplicate is shot by Spectrum officer Captain Blue and falls to his death from a tall structure, he returns to life with the consciousness and the normal personality of the original Captain Scarlet fully restored let alone his memories of Mysteron control, and thereafter he is free from Mysteron control. Captain Scarlet's Mysteronised body possesses two remarkable abilities: he is able to sense the presence of other Mysteron duplicates in his vicinity, and if he is injured or killed, his retro-metabolism restores him to a state of top health. Now able to deploy suicidally reckless tactics to thwart Mysteron threats, Captain Scarlet repeatedly braves the pain of death in the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will recover to face the Mysterons again.|$|E
5|$|The {{search for}} bodies continued, but with winter setting {{in it was}} called off in November. Presented with the {{evidence}} of the tape recording, Brady admitted to taking the photographs of Lesley Ann Downey, but insisted that she had been brought to Wardle Brook Avenue by two men who had subsequently taken her away again, alive. Brady was further charged with the murder of John Kilbride, and Hindley with the murder of Edward Evans, on 2 December. At the committal hearing on 6 December, Brady was charged with the murders of Edward Evans, John Kilbride, and Lesley Ann Downey, and Hindley with the murders of Edward Evans and Lesley Ann Downey, as well as with harbouring Brady in the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had killed John Kilbride. The prosecution's opening statement was held in camera, and the defence asked for a similar stipulation, but was refused. The proceedings continued in front of three magistrates in Hyde over an 11-day period during December, {{at the end of which}} the pair were committed for trial at Chester Assizes.|$|E
5|$|Izumi {{suggests}} {{that in the first}} six days, Makoto had been deceived by her and Okuhiko, but rather than believing in premonitions had believed he had traveled back in time. When Izumi died on April 6, and Makoto had desired to travel back in time, Curé Syndrome manifested. She {{suggests that}} while he had thought that he was traveling back in time, he had only imagined a different past where events played out differently, as part of a delusion, and that he had given himself partial memories in the form of premonitions in each loop; in the last loop, he would have given himself all his memories, other than the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is experiencing a delusion. She says that once Makoto succeeds in saving her, he will break out of the delusion, and the six days in his delusion will become reality. Makoto refuses to believe her, claiming that everything around him is reality, but starts to doubt throughout the week. Depending on the player's choices, the route branches into two endings. In one, the delusions appear to be changing reality, but are revealed to be a chain of coincidences. In the other, the delusions do change reality, and Makoto wakes up {{at the bottom of the}} cliff he fell down at the end of the last loop, badly wounded from having protected Izumi during the fall. It is left ambiguous as to what is real and what is a delusion, and whether Makoto has escaped to reality or still is trapped in his delusion.|$|E
5000|$|Michael Brooke (Sight & Sound) {{noted that}} despite the DVD cover's {{comparison}} to David Lynch's Eraserhead, La Belle captive was [...] "Alain Robbe-Grillet's most explicit tribute to the original French Surrealist movement.", noting that [...] "Robbe-Grillet constantly undermines narrative, temporal and spatial expectations at every turn while teasing the viewer with iconography drawn from Magritte, American thrillers, Murnau's Nosferatu and much else. It's tempting {{to assume that the}} somewhat vacant lead performances are absolutely as intended, the better to offset Daniel Emilfork's grotesque police investigator, smirking at <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> withholding from everyone else." ...|$|R

5|$|The third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, follows Harry in {{his third}} year of magical education. It is the only book in the series which does not feature Lord Voldemort in any form. Instead, Harry must deal with the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has been {{targeted}} by Sirius Black, his father's best friend, and, according to the Wizarding World, an escaped mass murderer who assisted {{in the murder of}} Harry's parents. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors – dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul and feed on despair – which are ostensibly protecting the school, he reaches out to Remus Lupin, a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who is eventually revealed to be a werewolf. Lupin teaches Harry defensive measures which are well above the level of magic generally executed by people his age. Harry comes to know that both Lupin and Black were best friends of his father and that Black was framed by their fourth friend, Peter Pettigrew, who had been hiding as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. In this book, a recurring theme throughout the series is emphasised – in every book there is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, none of whom lasts more than one school year.|$|E

50|$|Their {{relationship}} is fragile and tenuous. Colby believes he's {{out to get}} her brother and sister, and Rafael, an ancient Carpathian hunter, is completely clueless with dealing with a modern, fiercely independent woman. It is revealed that Colby has strong psychic talents {{and for a while}} she believes that Rafael might just be special as she is. Then she is forced to confront the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> from a different species entirely. And to make matters worse the vampire begins to attack her family and she is forced to accept the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> vampires of myth really do exist. When Colby's younger brother Paul is attacked by the vampire, Rafael recognizes him as an old boyhood friend, Kirja Malinov. Only when Rafael faces off and nearly dies defending her and her family from Kirja does Colby let herself realize her feelings for Rafael.|$|R
25|$|Leonardo's {{interest}} {{manifested itself}} in the drawing of streams and rivers, the action of water in eroding rocks, and the cataclysmic action of water in floods and tidal waves. The <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> gained from his studies was employed in devising a range of projects, particularly {{in relation to the}} Arno River. None of the major works was brought to completion.|$|E
25|$|In South Africa, the Australia {{team had}} a very {{successful}} tour and senior players such as Bill O'Reilly were pointed in their comments about the enjoyment of playing under Richardson's captaincy.

25|$|Sherwin-White's poor {{eyesight}} {{kept him}} from active service during World War II, but the President of St John's wrote to the Director of Naval Intelligence to recommend him for a post, and he was commissioned on 4 December 1941 as a Temporary Sub-Lieutenant. He helped to edit some of the Admiralty's series of geographical handbooks, acquiring detailed geographical <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> displayed in subsequent scholarship including a 1944 article about the historical geography of Algeria.|$|E
60|$|But {{the male}} in him was scotched by the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> {{she was not}} under his spell nor his influence. He wanted to go away from her. He rested in the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> to-morrow <b>he</b> was going away, his life was really elsewhere. His life was elsewhere--his life was elsewhere--the centre of his life was not what she would have. She was different--there was a breach between them. They were hostile worlds.|$|R

Rocco and Fidelio prepare to go to Florestan's cell, with the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must be killed and buried within the hour. Fidelio is shaken; Rocco tries to discourage Fidelio from coming, but Fidelio insists. As they prepare to leave, Jaquino and Marzelline rush in and tell Rocco to run, as Pizarro has learned that the prisoners were allowed to roam, and is furious (Ach, Vater, Vater, eilt!—"O, father, father, hurry!").|$|E

Meanwhile, Dionysus has become a teenager and lives in Lydia with a court of Satyrs. He falls in love {{for the first time with}} one of them, Ampelus (Vine). His passion for the boy is only spoiled by the <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will soon die, just as all the young lovers of the gods do. Dionysus and Ampelos indulge in a series of sports contests, the god allowing the god to win.|$|E
25|$|Stout {{served in}} the State House for two {{sessions}} in 1813 and 1814. He was then elected to the State Senate for two terms, beginning with the 1815 session and ending with the 1820 session, {{when he was elected}} Speaker. This was done in full <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would immediately become governor, as the person recently elected to become governor, Henry Molleston, had died before taking office. As part of the arrangement it was agreed that Stout would serve but one year and a special gubernatorial election would be held in 1820 for a two-year term. He served as Governor of Delaware from January 18, 1820 until January 16, 1821.|$|E
5000|$|... "Crocodile" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews with much appraisal {{going to the}} opening sequence, which was first aired in this episode. IGN gave it a [...] "Good" [...] rating of 7.8, and stated that it was [...] "...not as tightly constructed as the pilot, [...] "Crocodile" [...] still was solid and Michael C. Hall's performance as Dexter {{continues to be a}} wonderful one, deftly portraying all of the aspects of this complicated (to say the least) man, who has some unbelievable darkness hiding underneath his friendly exterior. And kudos to the excellent opening credits sequence, which consists of shots of Dexter going about several mundane activities that are made unsettling due to our <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> a serial killer".|$|R

Popovici, Ioan Șiadbei, Dimitrie Găzdaru, Grigore Scorpan, Haralambie Mihăescu and Gheorghe Ivănescu. Pascu, Ibrăileanu and Iordan took up his ideas on literary language, but it was Ivănescu who subjected them to a detailed critical analysis and developed his own theory by synthesizing Philippide's with linguistic idealism.|$|E
25|$|Philipson was a noted gardener. A {{visit to}} Japan {{on the way}} back from the Test series in Australia in 1895 {{inspired}} him to apply <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> acquired there to estate of Stobo Castle, near Peebles, in the Scottish Borders. Stobo had originally been in the family of Philipson's wife, the Honourable Nina Murray, until their exile following the Jacobite rising of 1745. The Japanese-style water garden that Philipson created at Stobo between 1909–13 has been maintained, despite a succession of owners after the estate was sold shortly after his death. Stobo was acquired in 1971 by Leo Seymour, whose family still own it, and is occasionally open to the public.|$|E

Aranea chastises him for being too concerned about {{what other people think}} as she was enlisted by Noctis to find him. She reveals that Verstael created a new model of magitek weapon called Immortalis that she intends to destroy, but refuses Prompto's help so long as he doubts himself. Prompto is visited by the spirit of Lunafreya who reminds him of the bonds he shared with his friends, and Prompto resolves to rejoin them.|$|E
