40|$|A {{systematic}} approach {{is presented to}} obtain improved panel fit quality {{through the use of}} an optimum panel fitting strategy. The objective of the optimal panel fitting strategy is to determine the location of the panels on the automobile body such that the gap and <b>flush</b> <b>variation</b> of the panel fit are minimized. This approach uses measurement data from both the panels and the body-in-white (BIW) to determine the optimum position of multiple panels in an automobile body opening. First, some indices are defined to quantify the quality of a panel fit. Second, the sources of variation in the gap and flush are presented. Then the multiple panel fitting problem is formulated into a constrained optimization model. The effects of the optimization model and algorithm by reducing the within-car gap and <b>flush</b> <b>variation</b> on average by 24, 3 % and by as much as 43, 4 % in the case study presented...|$|E

40|$|The {{prediction}} of leaf area for cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda Raf.) seedlings {{is important for}} studying the physiology of the species. Linear and polynomial models involving leaf length, width, fresh weight, dry weight, and internodal length were tested independently and collectively to predict leaf area. Twenty-nine cherrybark oak seedlings were grown in a greenhouse for one growing season {{and a total of}} 468 leaves were collected. Leaf area was polynomially related with leaf length or width, but linearly related with the cross product of length and width. Average leaf area for flush 3 was significantly greater than those of other <b>flushes.</b> However, <b>variation</b> in leaf area among flushes did not affect the models. Relationship between leaf area and length (or width) was consistent. Since leaf length is easy to measure and does not require destruction of leaves, it can be effectively used to predict leaf area in cherrybark oak seedlings...|$|R
40|$|This {{communication}} {{describes a}} simple technique for obtaining sufficient quantities of pure endometrial fluid (uterine cavitary fluid) for microchemical analysis. We believe this technique has several advantages over other methods of sampling uterine fluid. Various constituents of endometrial fluid have been measured in flushings of the uterine cavity obtained through the endocervical canal. These measure-ments are valuable in a qualitative way, {{but are not}} indicative ofactual cavitary concentrations because the volume of such fluid obtained by flushing is not known. Since endometrial fluid volume may vary {{from time to time}} in the same animal, and volume recovery may differ from flushing to <b>flushing,</b> only major <b>variations</b> in measured substances from flushings taken at different times in the same animal may be compared. Direct aspirates of significant volumes of cavitary fluid usually produce a fluid contaminated with blood since catheter insertion and suction traumatizes the endometrium. Various techniques were tried in our laboratory in an attempt to collect pur...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{riverine}} discharge, such {{as those}} due to reservoir <b>flushing,</b> seasonal <b>variation</b> or extreme precipitation events, can alter sediment transport rates and morphology of the stream bed. Experimental research investigated the effect of unsteady flow event hydrographs on stream bed morphological response. Laboratory experiments were conducted in a 5. 0 m-long sediment transport flume with a bed comprised of a medium sand. Experimental hydrographs were composed of antecedent (base-flow), unsteady event (flood) and post- flood (return to base-flow) stages. Three distinct series of experimental laboratory runs were conducted to systematically investigate the effect of three characteristics of unsteady flow event hydrographs: the magnitude, duration and hydrograph shape (i. e., time-to-peak flow) of the unsteady flow event. Bed morphological adjustments, sediment transport rates and {{the composition of the}} sediment in transport were measured throughout all stages of the experimental runs. Measured values were compared to predicted values calculated using traditional sediment transport and bed form geometry equations assuming steady flow conditions. In general, predicted values greatly underestimated both measured values of sediment transport and bed form geometry. Results show that systematic changes in the magnitude, duration and time-to-peak flow of the hydrograph cause varying types of hysteresis (clockwise or counter-clockwise) of the sediment transport rates which has a considerable effect on subsequent bed morphological adjustments. Shorter duration and symmetrical hydrographs exhibit counter-clockwise hysteresis while longer duration and asymmetrical hydrographs exhibit clockwise hysteresis. Results from this thesis contribute towards more accurate numerical modelling capabilities, and improved river management, engineering and restoration efforts...|$|R
40|$|Various {{categories}} of food packaging indicators namely; VTT, Ageless Eye, Mocon, Åbo Akademi and Impak were selected and incorporated into food trays manufactured at LUT packaging laboratory. Each of these food packaging indicators {{was used to}} investigate (visually and qualitatively) the transmission of oxygen through the seal, and tray material, {{as well as to}} detect microbial activity within the content of the package. Applications of different methods of gas <b>flushing,</b> content <b>variation</b> and introduction of two distinct levels of oxygen scavengers were employed as treatments to evaluate the packaging performance of the food packaging indicators. Ease of handling of each food packaging indicator was also taken into considerations. Findings showed that for packages, which contained chicken product, the amount of oxygen in the package, measured immediately after the sealing operation on the first day gradually decreased to zero percent by the third day of the storage period. The oxygen level remained at this point throughout the duration of storage for the chicken packages. Besides, level of oxygen in the packages without product continued to increase with the storage time, at moderate rate of 0. 1 % for 100 %N 2 and 0. 3 % for 30 %CO 2 / 70 %N 2 empty packages. More carbon dioxide gas was recorded for packages flushed with 30 %CO 2 / 70 %N 2. Results also revealed that visual analysis of one of the color indicators for example Ageless Eye, conformed to the data derived from the luminescence food-packaging indicator. This shows that packaging operation of the packaging line was considerably stable, and efficient with negligible exception. However, it was found that most of the food packaging indicators investigated in this research study exhibited considerable packaging challenges, such as, reaction with the content of the package (Impak); over sensitivity (Åbo Akademi and Impak); ease of handling problem (Åbo Akademi); and ease of activation problem (VTT indicators). In this study, the strengths and limitations of different indicators were analyzed. This study demonstrates the applicability of various indicators in MAP using chicken package application...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{differentiation}} in phenotypic traits among populations from heterogeneous environments {{is often}} observed in common-garden studies on forest trees, but data on adaptive variation in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Scotland are limited. As a result, current seed transfer guidelines {{are based on}} earlier molecular marker studies and do {{not take into account}} environmental or adaptive genetic variation. An analysis of spatial variation in climate showed substantial differences in temperature and precipitation among the native Scots pine sites in Scotland. To investigate whether differentiation in response to environmental variation has occurred in Scotland, a glasshouse-based common-garden trial of ~ 3, 360 seedlings from 21 populations and 84 open-pollinated families was established in 2007. At the beginning of the 2 nd growing season, timing of bud flush showed evidence of genetic differentiation among populations, with those from cooler origins generally <b>flushing</b> earlier. <b>Variation</b> was also found among families within populations, suggesting that the trait is genetically controlled. Populations and families showed different levels of variability in this trait which could be partly due to variable levels of temporal climate fluctuation in different parts of Scotland. Chlorophyll fluorescence was used to examine drought response in three-year old seedlings from five populations on sites that experience contrasting levels of annual rainfall. It was found that the response was not related to rainfall, but possibly to more complex moisture variables that also take into account additional factors such as evaporation. Also, photosynthetic capacity in response to cold winter temperatures varied significantly among eight populations that were kept outdoors, and the largest reduction was seen in seedlings from the mildest, most maritime coastal site. The following spring, height growth and needle flush started earlier in seedlings from cooler locations. Earlier studies on genetic diversity of native pinewoods have shown high levels of selectively neutral variation in this predominantly outcrossing conifer, and a mating system analysis with a limited number of microsatellite markers supported this pattern. Together, these data suggest that despite significant historic population size decrease, environmental gradients have resulted in genetic differentiation among native pinewoods. In order to minimise the risk of planting poorly-adapted stock and to maximise the success of replanting programmes, {{it is important that the}} origins of planting stock are carefully considered in management guidelines for the species.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to {{characterize}} the reservoir quality in the Middle and Upper Jurassic sandstone reservoirs in the South Viking Graben, with emphasis on {{the differences between the}} Hugin and Draupne formations. The focus of the study is to understand the diagenetic processes that have affected the deeply buried sandstones, both the mechanical and chemical compaction. The study involves eight wells situated {{in the eastern part of}} the South Viking Graben, in block 15 / 3, 24 / 12 and 15 / 5, all investigated using the following methods; well correlation, petrophysical assessment, mineralogical and petrographic analysis. Authigenic quartz cement will start to nucleate on detrital quartz grain surfaces at temperatures above 75 - 80 °C. The Middle and Upper Jurassic sandstones of the Hugin and Draupne formations are buried at depths exceeding 4 km. As the precipitation of quartz cement follows a time/temperature-integral, it is expected to have filled all pore-space in the deeply buried sandstones in the South Viking Graben. Mechanisms such as fluid overpressure, hydrocarbon emplacement and grain coating minerals may preserve porosity at great depths. The porosity distribution of the Middle and Upper Jurassic sandstones in the South Viking Graben showed three subpopulations of porosity; 0 - 10 %, 10 - 20 % and 20 - 30 %. According to porosity-depth curves reported from the study area, 0 - 15 % porosity is normal. Porosity above this level is considered anomalous, and may be related to porosity preserving mechanisms. The hydrocarbon emplacement appears to have had a negligible effect, while the grain coating minerals are believed to have been an important porosity preserving factor in the studied samples. The illite-coating was found in both of the studied formations, while the presence of microcrystalline quartz was restricted to samples from the Draupne formation and corresponded to the highest observed porosities. The microcrystalline coating is therefore considered to have been the main porosity preserving mechanism. The content of authigenic clay minerals was investigated both in optical microscope and using scanning electron microscopy. The proximal Hugin formation contained an abundance of kaolin, typically connected to meteoric water <b>flushing.</b> A <b>variation</b> of K-feldspar content is believed to be the cause of the varying degree of illitization within the formation. The Draupne formation was deposited in a distal setting and the sediments were isolated from meteoric water flushing. Correspondingly the Draupne formation has a low amount of kaolin and a correspondingly low amount of illite. The low amounts of illite are considered to be positive for the permeability of the formation, as the fibrous morphology of illite is known to reduce permeability. A stabilization of the intragranular volume at 25 % was observed, as well as stylolites, indicating that quartz cement from dissolution at stylolite has been the main porosity destructive mechanism in the Middle and Upper Jurassic sandstones in the South Viking Graben...|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} of urban {{drainage}} systems, synthetic design storms are commonly used to predict the peak flow rate in sewer systems and such storms are usually based on local intensity-duration frequency curves or design storm profiles. To estimate the quality of storm flow, the UPM Manual (1994) has highlighted the development of detailed and sophisticated simulation models to estimate the pollutographs, that is, the temporal variation in the concentration of pollutants in urban drainage systems. The data requirements of these models are quite onerous, and as a consequences implified models like SIMPOL have been developed. This model predicts the BOD at 1 hour time intervals {{and is based on}} the representation of the sewer system by a series of tanks. This approach may be considered satisfactory for the prediction of accumulative pollution over an annual series of events but for the prediction of acute effects, for example, the first foul <b>flush,</b> the temporal <b>variation</b> in the concentration pollutants in sewer flow is required. There is a need therefore to describe the change in pollution over a much smaller time interval than that proposed in SIMPOL and this is particularly so when consideration is given to the comparison of the design and control options which may be proposed, for example, the real time control of storage tanks to retain the first flush of pollutants. The work outlined in this thesis presents an alternate simple methodology to estimate the pollutographs corresponding to a particular storm event. The work is {{based on the results of}} the measured pollutographs recorded on the WRc sewer quality archive (1987) from two catchments at Great Harwood and Clayton-le- Moors in the North West of England. The relationships for the shape of the pollutograph were obtained by the direct comparison of the observed pollutographs. The peak TSS concentrations were obtained by a detailed regression analysis of the observed peak TSS concentrations, the antecedent dry weather period and the hydrological parameters of maximum rainfall intensity, average rainfall intensity and storm duration. These parameters were then related to the shape of the pollutograph and the results of this methodology were shown to satisfactorily reproduce results for the catchments considered. For practical applications, the suggested procedure provides a methodology to calibrate the design pollutographs for any catchment from a limited number of monitored storm events and to utilise these together with time series storms to assist in the performancea ssessmenat nd selectiono f alternative design options. The work has the limitation that it is catchment specific but as more information for different catchments becomes available, it may be possible to establish standard pollutographs for application to a wide range of catchment conditions...|$|R
