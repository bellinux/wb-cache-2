40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to answer the {{question}} of whether earplugs provide sufficient protection in the exposure to impulse noise generated during metalworking processes. Material and Methods: The noise generated by die forging hammer and punching machine was characterized. Using an acoustic test fixture, noise parameters (LCpeak, LAmax) under 24 earplugs, foam, winged and no-roll, were measured. Octave band method was used to calculate values of LAeq under earplugs. Results: It was found that in the case of punching machine the <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> of A-weighted noise exposure level, normalized to an 8 -h working day (LEX, 8 h = 94. 8 dB) of noise present at the workstation, was exceeded, while in the case of die forging hammer both the <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> of this parameter (LEX, 8 h = 108. 3 dB) and the <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> of peak sound pressure level (LCpeak = 148. 9 dB) were exceeded. The assessment of noise parameters (LCpeak, LAmax, LAeq) under earplugs revealed that the noise attenuation can be insufficient, sufficient, or too high. Conclusions: Earplugs can be suitable hearing protection devices in metalworking processes. Of the 24 earplugs included in this study, 9 provided appropriate noise attenuation in the case of tested die forging hammer and 10 in the case of tested punching machine.
