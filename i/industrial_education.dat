The Business Building and the Industrial Arts Building opened in 1973 and University Hall received renovations in 1974 that included new seating, an improved sound system, and air conditioning in the auditorium. In 1979, the Student Recreation Center and the Moore Musical Arts Center opened. In 1970, the Board of Trustees ended an alcoholic beverage ban on campus. The Cardinal Room, an on-campus eatery, began serving beer. A growing trend in the late 1960s and early 1970s was the development of large apartment complexes adjacent to campus. By the 1970s approximately 4,000 students lived in private, off-campus housing. On campus, Darrow Hall became the first co-ed dorm in 1972 with men and women inhabiting alternating floors.|$|E
5|$|World War I caused several {{changes at}} the school. During the {{conflict}} and for some time afterwards, Georgia Tech hosted a school for cadet aviators, supply officers, and army technicians. Tech also started a Reserve Officer Training Corps unit; {{the first in the}} Southern United States, it became a permanent addition to the school. World War I affected the school academically as well: the United States government asked for and financed an automotive school for army officers, a rehabilitation program for disabled soldiers, and a geology department. Federal aid also helped to establish Tech's <b>Industrial</b> <b>Education</b> Department, courtesy of the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917. The war also placed on hold extensive fundraising efforts for a new power plant, and made it difficult to find engineers willing to teach at the school; Matheson toured Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, and MIT in 1919 but failed to secure a single hire, as none of the students wished to work for such low wages.|$|E

40|$|As {{representations}} of the aims, mission, and aspirations of industrial arts/technology educators, the written goals of the field have always prescribed a liberal educational role for <b>industrial</b> arts/technology <b>education.</b> Goal statements exceed the single goal of skill development and include such goals as helping students to become wise consumers and problem solvers and to understand industry and technology. <b>Industrial</b> arts/technology <b>education</b> goals have evolved over time. This evolution has reflected a drift towards more liberal education ideals with goals which specify {{the study of the}} relationships among industry, technology, and society, the interdisciplinary nature of the field, and general problem solving. The practice of <b>industrial</b> arts/technology <b>education,</b> however, has not always demonstrated a clear relationship to those goal statements. <b>Industrial</b> arts/technology <b>education</b> laboratories and student activities often resemble vocational education laboratories and student activities. Moreover, much of the prescriptive theory of curriculum planning for <b>industrial</b> arts/technology <b>education</b> is technical in nature, relying upon curriculum planning techniques which are based upon behaviorism. A discontinuity exists in the descriptive theory (goal statements) and prescriptive theory (curriculum-planning practices) of <b>industrial</b> arts/technology <b>education.</b> This discontinuity is caused, in part, by the strategies used for planning curriculum and the limited prescriptive theory which exists in the field...|$|R

First, students would receive a basic elementary education and then an <b>industrial</b> <b>education</b> {{at the high school}} level. This model envisioned preparing students for the work available in the rural areas in which most of them lived. Boys would become farmers and perhaps skilled tradesmen, and girls would become wives and homemakers, as well as laundresses, dressmakers, or domestic workers. The best students were encouraged to become teachers and work in the community or outlying areas to promote further education along the Hampton-Tuskegee model. There was a great push to continue to improve literacy among both children and adults, and teaching was a high calling.|$|E

Princess Alice of Hesse, who had become interested in social reform, invited her, along with Catherine Winkworth, to Darmstadt to help organise a Congress of Women Workers in 1872. This meeting resolved to work towards a [...] "better preparation for domestic life" [...] and [...] "to pay greater attention to the mental development of {{an interest in the}} practical problems of life." [...] At the conclusion of the meeting Carpenter proposed the establishment of an International Union for the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Education</b> of Women. She went on to Neuchâtel, Switzerland to study Louis Guillaume's prison system, and in 1873 to America, where she met abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass. She visited prisons and in 1874 wrote to the New York Prison Association to express her concern about [...] "the dreadful state of the Prisons".|$|E
500|$|Wilbert Ahern (Journal of American History) {{found the}} book's {{arguments}} convincing and [...] "gracefully written", {{but wanted to}} know more about Armstrong's background in financial administration, forming of ties with the Northern philanthropists, and successful students apart from Booker T. Washington. Jennings Wagoner (History of Education Quarterly) noted that Armstrong's intentions were portrayed as comparable to the leaders of George Fredrickson's Inner Civil War, who saw their work as an extension of that of the Founding Fathers. Wagoner wrote that Engs provided a [...] "well-grounded" [...] biography that handles Armstrong's [...] "complexities and contradictions" [...] with skillful use of the historiography and understanding of the era. Ahern emphasized the biography's [...] "balance" [...] in contrast to prior partisan writing on Armstrong. He noted Donald Spivey's Schooling for the New Slavery and Engs's first book, the 1979 Freedmen's First Generation, as examples of work that associates Armstrong with [...] "stifling ... African-American aspirations". Ahern also wrote that Engs's work affirms the then-controversial claim in James McPherson's 1975 The Abolitionist Legacy that Armstrong was [...] "fundamentally dedicated to the advancement of opportunity for African Americans" [...] and other races. Edna Green Medford (The North Carolina Historical Review) wrote that the book was particularly valuable to the historiography of <b>industrial</b> <b>education.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 1901, Du Bois wrote {{a review}} {{critical}} of Washington's autobiography Up from Slavery, which he later expanded and published {{to a wider}} audience as the essay [...] "Of Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others" [...] in The Souls of Black Folk. Later in life, Du Bois regretted having been critical of Washington in those essays. One of the contrasts between the two leaders was their approach to education: Washington felt that African-American schools should focus primarily on <b>industrial</b> <b>education</b> topics such as agricultural and mechanical skills, to prepare southern blacks for the opportunities {{in the rural areas}} where most lived. Du Bois felt that black schools should focus more on liberal arts and academic curriculum (including the classics, arts, and humanities), because liberal arts were required to develop a leadership elite. However, as sociologist E. Franklin Frazier and economists Gunnar Myrdal and Thomas Sowell have argued, such disagreement over education was a minor point of difference between Washington and Du Bois; both men acknowledged the importance of the form of education that the other emphasized. Sowell has also argued that, despite genuine disagreements between the two leaders, the supposed animosity between Washington and Du Bois actually formed among their followers, not between Washington and Du Bois themselves. Du Bois himself also made this observation in an interview published in The Atlantic Monthly in November 1965.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong {{was born}} and raised in Hawaii in the mid-1800s. His father was the Kingdom of Hawaii's (secular) {{minister}} of public instruction, whose schools practiced the [...] "manual labor principle of education". Engs wrote that Armstrong's Hawaiian childhood insulated him from racist sentiment on the mainland. Armstrong attended private schools in Oahu before moving to study on the mainland. He shied away from the ministry, believing as his father, [...] "the shorter one's creed, the better". Armstrong's experience in the Civil War—including as a prisoner of war, leader of the United States Colored Troops, and General—led to his lifelong pursuit of [...] "noble strife" [...] in helping his [...] "fellow man". He joined the Freedmen's Bureau and served as the first principal of the Hampton Institute on the Virginia Peninsula. Hampton's task was to prepare African Americans [...] "to teach their people the 'civilizing' ways of white men" [...] through [...] "Christian teachings, a strict code of conduct, and manual labor". Hampton was one of eight American Missionary Association teacher-training schools. Armstrong left a 25-year legacy, and introduced the school's manual and industrial teaching methods in the late 1860s despite its increased cost. Engs distinguishes this vision from the post-1900 <b>industrial</b> <b>education,</b> with Armstrong's [...] "industry" [...] signifying the industriousness of [...] "self-discipline and self-reliance". The labor proceeds also supported the black students through school, though only during school months. Armstrong sought to see his [...] "best" [...] graduates ascend to higher education and to occupations [...] "originally envisioned for whites". As his [...] "most famous student", [...] "virtual son", and [...] "spiritual heir", Booker T. Washington opened the Tuskegee Institute in the style of Hampton. Armstrong later expanded Hampton's scope to include Native Americans, who were kept apart from the blacks as a [...] "school within a school".|$|E

The pastor of that church dwelt close to it in a wooden house or log cabin, which possessed only one window and a door. A much larger hut alongside of it served as a school-house and meeting-hall. In this little building the man of God, assisted by a Red Indian convert, taught the Red Men of the wilderness {{the way of life}} through Jesus Christ, besides giving them a little elementary and <b>industrial</b> <b>education</b> suited to their peculiar circumstances; and here, on the day of which we write, he had prepared the sumptuous feast to which reference has just been made. The pastor's wife and daughter had prepared it. There were venison pies and ptarmigan pasties; there were roasts of fowls, and roasts of rabbits, and stews of many things which we will not venture to describe, besides puddings of meat, and puddings of rice, and puddings of plums; also tea and coffee to wash it all down. There was no strong drink. Strong health and appetite were deemed sufficient to give zest to the proceedings. The company was remarkably savage to look at, but wonderfully civilised in conduct, for the influence of Christian love was there, and that influence is the same everywhere. Leathern garments clothed the men; curtailed petticoats adorned the women; both wore leggings and moccasins. The boys and girls were similarly costumed, and all had brilliant teeth, brown faces, glittering eyes, lank black hair, and a look of eager expectancy.|$|E
