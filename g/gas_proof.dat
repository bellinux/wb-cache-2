In the 1920s Lotka attempted to build on Boltzmann's views through a mathematical synthesis of energetics with biological evolutionary theory. Lotka proposed that the selective principle of evolution was one which favoured the maximum useful energy flow transformation. This view subsequently influenced the further development of ecological energetics, especially the work of Howard T. Odum.|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that all {{properties of the}} hot X-ray emitting gas in galaxy clusters are completely determined by the underlying dark matter (DM) structure. Apart from the standard conditions of spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium for the <b>gas,</b> our <b>proof</b> {{is based on the}} Jeans equation for the DM and two simple relations which have recently emerged from numerical simulations: the equality of the gas and DM temperatures, and the almost linear relation between the DM velocity anisotropy profile and its density slope. For DM distributions described by the NFW or the Sersic profiles, the resulting gas density profile, the gas-to-total-mass ratio profile, and the entropy profile are all in good agreement with X-ray observations. All these profiles are derived using zero free parameters. Our result allows us to predict the X-ray luminosity profile of a cluster in terms of its DM content alone. As a consequence, a new strategy becomes available to constrain the DM morphology in galaxy clusters from X-ray observations. Our results can also be used as a practical tool for creating initial conditions for realistic cosmological structures to be used in numerical simulations.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the sound proof properties of the double layer acryl plates with various packing materials inside. The acryl plates were filled with vacuum pressure ranged from- 20 to- 80 kPa, fumed silica as nano-porous materials, and HCFC (hydrochloro-fluorocarbon) as inert gas. The sound pressure level passed though panels was measured to compare soundproof performance. All other panel showed better performance from 500 - 1000 Hz than air layer panel. For the vacuum layer panel, panel with- 80 kPa showed the best performance among other vacuum layer panel throughout all range of frequency. It is found that the more nano-material filled in panel, the lower sound proof performance. When it comes to panel filled with inert <b>gas,</b> the sound <b>proof</b> performance improved when it has greater pressure of gas...|$|R
40|$|We {{prove the}} {{uniqueness}} of Riemann solutions {{in the class of}} entropy solutions in L∞ ∩ BVloc with arbitrarily large oscillation for the 3 × 3 system of Euler equations in <b>gas</b> dynamics. The <b>proof</b> for solutions with large oscillation is based on a detailed analysis of the global behavior of shock curves in the phase space and the singularity of centered rarefaction waves near the center in the physical plane. The uniqueness of Riemann solutions yields their inviscid large-time stability under arbitrarily large L 1 ∩ L∞ ∩ BVloc perturbation of the Riemann initial data, as long as the corresponding solutions are in L∞ and have local bounded total variation satisfying a natural condition on its growth with time. No specific reference to any particular method for constructing the entropy solutions is needed. The uniqueness result for Riemann solutions can easily be extended to entropy solutions U(x, t), piecewise Lipschitz in x, for any t > 0, with arbitrarily large oscillation...|$|R
40|$|Because of coeliac disease, some {{individuals}} cannot tolerate the protein gliadin {{present in the}} gluten fraction of wheat flour. From a commercial perspective, {{there is a need}} for the development of gluten-free bread with texture and flavour properties similar to the conventional wheat flour loaf. In the context of bread, the gluten component of wheat has a crucial role in stabilising the gas-cell structure and maintaining the rheological properties of the bread. The absence of gluten results in liquid batter rather than pre-baking dough, yielding baked bread with a crumbling texture, poor colour and other post-baking quality defects. The liquid batter cannot be processed on the existing production line of baking industry. The aim is to develop a gluten-free white loaf with similar quality characteristics to that of standard white bread on the existing processing lines at Quality Bakers New Zealand. Within this constraint, dough has to be produced with handling and moulding properties similar to those of conventional wheat flour loaves. This research focused on finding and implementing the gluten substitutes for the development of gluten-free high quality commercial bread. In this research, the independent variables were conventional wheat flour (the most basic control), other gluten-free flours from a variety of sources, starches, supplementary proteins, hydrocolloids such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), hydrophilic psyllium husk, and enzymes such as microbial transglutaminase, glucose oxidase, lipase and fungal α-amylase. These ingredients were trialled in different combination and composition to produce a dough having ability to trap the carbon dioxide <b>gas</b> during <b>proofing</b> and baking to get high specific volume bread suitable for the Quality Bakers’ product range. After an essentially ‘shotgun’ approach to formulations, the research narrowed to a systematic and progressive variation of ingredients and their composition to develop workable commercial models. Ingredients and their compositions were manipulated according to the outcomes of the trials and their contribution in the formulations. The dependent variables included standard bakery rheological properties based on dough stickiness, dough extensibility, oven spring, bread specific volume, bread slice ability, and bread staling. A gelation system of the lower-temperature-stable hydrocolloid psyllium husk, the heat-stable hydrocolloid hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, maize starch, and potato starch was created to form industrial process able dough having ability to entrap carbon dioxide <b>gas</b> produced during <b>proofing</b> and initial phase of baking. Microbial transglutaminase was used to increase the cross linking of protein present in flours and supplemented for enhancing the dough-like structure and its gas entrapping abilities. A formulation has been discovered by this research for the development of high quality gluten-free commercial bread. The formulated bread has similar quality characteristics to that of standard white bread and can be produced on existing processing lines at Quality Bakers. Industrial process able gluten-free bread with similar quality characteristics to that of standard white bread can be formulated by using a specific combination of soy flour, maize starch, potato starch, yoghurt powder, milk protein, HPMC (K 4 M), psyllium husk, microbial transglutaminase, lipase, and fungal α-amylase. The significance of this research is mainly commercial and the insights gained may extend to other bakery items that could be used by coeliacs...|$|R
40|$|The {{rheological}} properties of gas cell walls in bread doughs {{are considered to}} be important in relation to their stability and <b>gas</b> retention during <b>proof</b> and baking. Large deformation {{rheological properties}} of gas cell walls were measured using biaxial extension for a number of doughs of varying breadmaking quality at constant strain rate and elevated temperatures of 25 - 60 degreesC. Strain hardening and failure strain of cell walls both decreased with temperature, with cell walls in good breadmaking doughs remaining stable and retaining their strain hardening properties at higher temperatures (60 degreesC), while the cell walls of poor breadmaking doughs became unstable at lower temperatures (45 - 50 degreesC) and had lower strain hardening. Strain hardening measured at 50 degreesC gave good correlations with baking volume, with the best correlations achieved between rheological measurements and baking tests that used similar mixing conditions. As predicted by the considered failure criterion, a strain hardening value of I defines a region below which gas cell walls become unstable, and discriminates well between the baking quality of a range of commercial flour blends of varying quality. This indicates that the stability of gas cell walls during baking is strongly related to strain hardening properties, and that extensional rheological measurements can be used as indicators of baking quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to characterize the effects of xanthan gum on gluten-free bread formulations. An improved gluten-free flour blend consisting of brown rice flour, quinoa flour, and sorghum flour was used with the aim of developing a gluten-free bread formulation comparable to traditional gluten-based bread and commercial gluten-free bread mix. Rheological measurements were taken to analyze the effects of xanthan gum on pre-baked dough formulations. Higher concentrations of xanthan gum were found to decrease the loss factor thus strengthening the elastic properties of the dough, elongating the linear viscoelastic region and increasing the viscosity of the dough. Furthermore, the xanthan gum samples were not independent of frequency and the loss factor decreased as frequency increased. Porosity of samples was also analyzed using imaging technology to determine the average pore size. Pore size increased as xanthan gum concentration increased indicating the ability for xanthan gum to retain <b>gas</b> during the <b>proofing</b> stage before baking. It was concluded that xanthan gum was necessary for a loaf with nice crumb texture, loaf color, and moisture content though different than gluten-based and commercial brand gluten-free bread mix. 0. 3 % xanthan gum concentration provided the most desirable post-baked crumb texture, loaf volume, and moisture contentby Rebecca Y.

40|$|The {{industrial}} use of laser emission spectrometry for particle analysis in gas at overpressure is a metrological challenge {{due to a}} reduction of analytical sensitivity caused by a top gas pressure of up to four bar. In {{the scope of this}} work it is shown that an increase of the gas pressure affects the electron pressure as well as the electron density due to collison and relaxation processes. Plasma properties are changed which lead to a decrease of line intensity, line broadening and to a decrease of signal-to-backround ratio. Consequently the gas pressure has an impact on the plasma dynamics and must be considered as a relevant parameter for the analysis of gas and particles in <b>gas.</b> Model calculations <b>proof</b> that the observed change of the emission line profil can by described by Stark-Effekt-braodening and Stark-Effekt-shift using a plasma model with core- and shell- specific electron temperatures. Double pulses with interpulse separation in the ns region are used to increase the line intensity of the LIBS spectra and to avoid the impact of overpressure on the emission line profil, thus leading to an enhanced signal-to-backround ratio of the spectral emission lines. Based on the laboratory results a laser set-up for field tests in steel industry was developed and tested on-site for muli-element analysis at different European blast furnaces. Signal-to-background ratio was optimised by double pulse excitation to allow the analysis of low-concentrated cirulting elements in top gas covering a few ppm. Line broadening and spectral shift is in a way reduced which makes a re-profilation of the laser-based set-up due to variations in top gas pressure no longer necessary.

40|$|Molecular {{size and}} {{structure}} of the gluten polymers that make up the major structural components of wheat are related to their rheological properties via modem polymer rheology concepts. Interactions between polymer chain entanglements and branching are seen to be the key mechanisms determining the rheology of HMW polymers. Recent work confirms the observation that dynamic shear plateau modulus is essentially independent of variations in MW amongst wheat varieties of varying baking performance and is not related to variations in baking performance, and {{that it is not the}} size of the soluble glutenin polymers, but the structural and rheological properties of the insoluble polymer fraction that are mainly responsible for variations in baking performance. The rheological properties of gas cell walls in bread doughs are considered to be important in relation to their stability and <b>gas</b> retention during <b>proof</b> and baking, in particular their extensional strain hardening properties. Large deformation rheological properties of gas cell walls were measured using biaxial extension for a number of doughs of varying breadmaking quality at constant strain rate and elevated temperatures in the range 25 - 60 degrees C. Strain hardening and failure strain of cell walls were both seen to decrease with temperature, with cell walls in good breadmaking doughs remaining stable and retaining their strain hardening properties to higher temperatures (60 degrees C), whilst the cell walls of poor breadmaking doughs became unstable at lower temperatures (45 - 50 degrees C) and had lower strain hardening. Strain hardening measured at 50 degrees C gave good correlations with baking volume, with the best correlations achieved between those rheological measurements and baking tests which used similar mixing conditions. As predicted by the Considere failure criterion, a strain hardening value of I defines a region below which gas cell walls become unstable, and discriminates well between the baking quality of a range of commercial flour blends of varying quality. This indicates that the stability of gas cell walls during baking is strongly related to their strain hardening properties, and that extensional rheological measurements can be used as predictors of baking quality.

40|$|Hypothesis: An enzymatic assay for {{quantification}} of γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) in biofluids can {{be employed}} for targeted screening of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADHD) in selected populations. Rationale: We used a two-tiered study approach, in which the first study (proof of concept) examined 7 urine samples derived from patients with SSADHD and 5 controls, and the second study (feasibility study) examined a broader sample population of patients and controls, including plasma. Objective: Split samples of urine and plasma (anonymized) were evaluated by enzymatic assay, <b>gas</b> chromatography alone (<b>proof</b> of concept) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, and the results compared. Method: Multiple detection methods {{have been developed to}} detect GHB. We evaluated an enzymatic assay which employs recombinant GHB dehydrogenase coupled to NADH production, the latter quantified on a Cobas Integra 400 Plus. Results: In our proof of concept study, we analyzed 12 urine samples (5 controls, 7 SSADHD), and in the feasibility study we evaluated 33 urine samples (23 controls, 10 SSADHD) and 31 plasma samples (14 controls, 17 SSADHD). The enzymatic assay carried out on a routine clinical chemistry analyzer was robust, revealing excellent agreement with instrumental methods in urine (GC-FID: r =  0. 997, p ≤  0. 001; GC–MS: r =  0. 99, p ≤  0. 001); however, the assay slightly over-estimated GHB levels in plasma, especially those in which GHB levels were low. Conversely, correlations for the enzymatic assay with comparator methods for higher plasma GHB levels were excellent (GC–MS; r =  0. 993, p ≤  0. 001). Conclusion: We have evaluated the capacity of this enzymatic assay to identify patients with SSADHD via quantitation of GHB. The data suggests that the enzymatic assay may be a suitable screening method to detect SSADHD in selected populations using urine. In addition, the assay can be used in basic research the elucidate the mechanism of the underlying disease or monitor GHB- levels for the evaluation of drug candidates.
