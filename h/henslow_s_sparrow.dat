40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{decline in}} numbers of Henslow’s Sparrows in North America (Sauer et al. 2001) is {{generally}} considered to be due to reduction in the extent of its preferred breeding habitat, “relatively large fields consisting of tall, dense grass, a well-developed litter layer, standing dead vegetation, and sparse or no woody vegetation” (Herkert et al. 2002). Since 1985, however, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has allowed payments to landowners by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) through the Farm Service Agency (FSA) to idle croplands and to seed them to various grasses. This has provided habitat that appears to have stabilized Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrow</b> numbers {{in some parts of the}} breeding range (Herkert 1997; Herkert et al. 2002; Reinking 2002; McCoy 2000). Nebraska has 472, 000 hectares (l, 166, 000 acres) of CRP grassland, about four times more than the remaining area of tallgrass prairie (Steinauer and Collins 1996), but most is aging, unmanaged, and less attractive to most grassland birds (Negus 2005). To better understand the occurrence of Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrow</b> in Nebraska, we surveyed grasslands south and east of Lincoln from May to August 2006. The survey goals were to search for grassland sites that might provide suitable nesting habitat, count Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrows</b> at each site, and use point counts to estimate abundance of Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrows</b> in this region...|$|R

40|$|We tested how edges affect nest {{survival}} and predator distribution in a native tallgrass prairie system in southwestern Missouri using artificial nests, natural nests of Dickcissels (Spiza americana) and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (Ammodramus henslowii), and mammal track stations. Survival of artificial nests was lower within 30 m of forest edge. Nesting success of Dickcissels and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrows</b> was lower within 50 m to a shrubby edge than at greater distances, whereas fates of nests were {{not related to}} distances to roads, agricultural fields, or forests. Evidence from clay eggs placed in artificial nests indicated that mid-sized carnivores were the major predators within 30 m of forest edges. Furthermore, mid-sized carnivores visited track stations most frequently within 50 m of forest edges. Because proximity of woody habitat explained more variation in nest {{survival and}} mammal activity than did fragment size, it appears that edge effects were more pronounced than area effects. Edge effects appeared to be caused mainly by greater exposure of nests to mid- sized carnivores. We argue that, based on edge avoidance behavior, 2 ̆ 2 grassland-interior 2 ̆ 2 species such as the Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrow</b> respond to edge effects mainly by a decrease in density, whereas habitat generalists such as the Dickcissel are affected mainly by a decrease in nesting success...|$|R

40|$|The {{grassland}} bird-community {{has declined}} significantly in abundance and diversity in Illinois {{over the past}} century. Reclamation of surface coal-mines in southern Illinois has created ca. 50, 000 ha of grassland habitat that offers surrogate habitat for grassland and shrubland birds.

The purposes of this research were to identify the bird community utilizing reclaimed surface-mines in southern Illinois, and to examine the habitat-associations of the bird community and compare those to previously reported habitat-associations. I examined bird communities, plant structure and composition, and invertebrate communities at grasslands and shrublands at 3 reclaimed surface-mines in southern Illinois.

We provide new information on several aspects of Le Conte 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrow</b> breeding biology, including rates of nest parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) and potential factors affecting breeding densities and nesting success of the species. Our study was conducted in the tallgrass prairie of northwestern Minnesota and southeastern North Dakota during 1998 - 2002. Breeding densities varied among years, but this variation was not clearly linked to climatic patterns. Vegetation had some influence on densities of Le Conte 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrows; densities were highest in grasslands with moderate amounts of bare ground. Prairie patch size and the percentage of shrubs and trees in the landscape had no recognizable influence on density. Nesting success was highly variable among sites and years and increased slightly with distance from trees. Rates of nest parasitism were low (1 of 50 nests parasitized), and clutch sizes were similar to those of other studies of Le Conte 2 ̆ 7 s Sparro...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the impacts}} of {{livestock}} and human activities on riparian zones and associated wildlife have been well documented, {{little is known about}} the impacts that browsing by large native ungulates such as elk and moose may have. In the northern Yellowstone area, some willow stands experience intense browsing by elk and moose whereas others experience medium or very low amounts of browsing. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare the species and densities of birds among willow stands that have experienced different intensities of browsing by native ungulates, (2) to measure the relationship between five species of birds and aspects of habitat structure, and (3) to develop and evaluate predictive models that relate presence or absence of the five species to habitat characteristics.

40|$|I {{examined}} {{reproductive success}} and post-fledging dispersal of shrubsteppe-obligate passerines {{to determine if}} either mechanism might contribute to the reduced abundance previously reported for these species in fragmented habitat. During 1999 and 2000, I monitored nests of sage thrashers (Oreoscoptes montanus), sage sparrows (Amphispiza belli), and Brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Spizella breweri) in fragmented, edge, and contiguous shrub steppe habitat in southwestern Idaho. The combination of nest success and relative abundance among sage thrashers and Brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sparrows</b> was consistent with trends I would expect if contiguous habitat functioned as a source and fragmented habitat as a sink (only fragmented and contiguous treatments were consistently compared among all species). Nest success of these two species was significantly less in fragmented habitat, whereas relative abundance between treatments was similar. Conversely, nest success and relative abundance of sage sparrows were similar between treatments. I fit logistic regression models of nest success for sage thrashers and Brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sparrows</b> using both local and landscape scale predictor variables. Heterogeneity of shrub habitat (Angular Second Moment) was included in models for both species (but at different scales) and was used to create maps predicting the relative probability of nest success for each species in my study area. I examined post-fledging dispersal of sage thrashers from contiguous and edge habitats only, as no birds fledged in fragmented habitat. Twenty individuals from 10 nests (1999, n = 7; 2000, n = 3) were monitored up to 44 days. To evaluate habitat associations of juveniles as they dispersed, principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to environmental measures around nests and dispersal locations. No correlation was found between habitat occupied by juveniles and time during the first 30 days away from the nest and habitat variability increased with time. Furthermore, dispersal distances varied greatly among juveniles. Lack of habitat affinity suggests that post-fledging dispersal might not be responsible for lower numbers of shrubsteppe-obligate birds in fragmented habitat. My results suggest that dissimilar reproductive success between fragmented and contiguous habitat could contribute to reduced numbers of shrubsteppe-obligate birds in fragmented habitat. I also {{found no evidence that}} post-fledging dispersal might function to decrease bird densities in fragmented habitat and it may actually facilitate an exchange of individuals between habitats when they are adjacent. This potential source - sink scenario could lower the population equilibrium. Therefore, I recommend that managers should concentrate on preserving habitat conducive to successful reproduction. This might include identifying larger landscape configurations, via Geographic Information System (GIS) applications, that are correlated with high nest success (e. g. in my study, low shrub heterogeneity and high shrub composition was positively related to the nest success of sage thrashers and Brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sparrows).</b> Subsequently, variables at smaller scales should be evaluated. Until we determine the relationship between natal and breeding habitats of shrubsteppe-obligate passerines, protecting habitats that correlate with high nest success likely is our most effective tool to minimize population declines...|$|R

During 1979 - 2001, we assessed abundance of passerine birds (9 grassland species and 1 shrub-associate species) on 2 brush-invaded, mixed-grass prairie tracts at Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge in northwestern North Dakota. Each tract encompassed 90 ha (220 ac) that were being restored through 4 prescribed fires then 3 consecutive years of grazing by cattle. Fires were separated by 2 - 4 years of rest (i. e., nondisturbance) and grazing was initiated 2 years after the last fire.

Biotic stressors associated with nesting in tidal environments suggest an important role for differential adaptation in shaping hybrid zone dynamics, with saltmarsh sparrows predicted to be better adapted to nesting in salt marshes.

40|$|I {{estimate}} that 215 bird species currently breed or have previously bred in Nebraska. This number compares {{with a total}} of 330 species that breed or have bred in the Great Plains region south of Canada, as I defined that region in my book on the breeding birds of the Great Plains (Johnsgard, 1979). Grasslands or potential grasslands make up about 81 percent of the Great Plains 2 ̆ 7 vegetation, and probably represented about 96 percent of Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s original vegetation. Only in the Sandhills region is that vegetation type still essentially intact; the tall-grass prairie of eastern Nebraska is Virtually gone. In my 1979 summary, I judged that 36 species of Great Plain 2 ̆ 7 s bird are grassland-adapted forms, with 15 of these endemic to the Great Plains, and the rest more broadly distributed. Nine of these endemics breed in Nebraska (Greater Prairie-Chicken, Mountain Plover, Long-billed Curlew, Upland Sandpiper, Dickcissel, Lark Bunting, Clay-colored Sparrow, Cassin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrow,</b> McCown 2 ̆ 7 s Longspur and Chestnut-collared Longspur), and the Chihuahuan Raven also once did. None of these ten species is considered endangered nationally, although the Greater Prairie-Chicken needs to be monitored closely. Birds of the tall-grass prairie that currently breed in eastern Nebraska include the Upland Sandpiper, Dickcissel. Eastern Meadowlark, Field Sparrow and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrow.</b> Both of the latter are not, strictly speaking, prairie species, but either represent a later successional stage containing some small trees (Field Sparrow), or the presence some brushy or weedy elements (Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrow).</b> In the west the short-grass plains support several declining or rare species, including Ferruginous Hawk, Swainson 2 ̆ 7 s Hawk, Prairie Falcon, Mountain Plover, Burrowing Owl, Common Poor-will, Lark Bunting, and two longspurs. Some of these also have certain additional non-vegetative needs such as cliff-side nest sites (Prairie Falcon), burrows (Burrowing Owl), nearly bare ground (Mountain Plover), or rocky substrates (Poor-will). The geographically and ecologically intermediate Sandhills prairies support many typical grassland and wet meadow breeders, such as Sharp-tailed Grouse, Long-billed Curlew, Bobolink, Lark Sparrow, Grasshopper Sparrow and Horned Lark. Woodlands and forests comprise about 15 percent of the native vegetation of the Great Plains states, and support some 51 percent of the region 2 ̆ 7 s breeding avifauna (Johnsgard, 1979). I {{estimate that}} in Nebraska this vegetation type occupies three percent of the state 2 ̆ 7 s surface area, and supports 48 percent of its avifauna. It is thus {{one of the most important}} vegetation types for generating species diversity of our avifauna. Bald Eagles are among the rare woodland-nesting species of Nebraska, although they are also strongly water-dependent for food.

50|$|As {{planned in}} 1865, {{the line was}} built as a wooden-railed tramway, with {{construction}} commencing in 1871. On 20 August 1872, a steam locomotive constructed by the Dunedin firm of Messrs R. <b>S.</b> <b>Sparrow</b> and Co. was delivered and operated on the completed portion of tramway; {{this was the first}} New Zealand-built locomotive to run. The line was completed to Palmerston North on 25 July 1873, a distance of 40 kilometres, and soon proposals were made to extend it to Wanganui. However, by 1874, the inadequacies of wooden rails were becoming apparent, and after an attempt at relaying the line with iron rails in February 1875 did not provide the durability required, {{the decision was made to}} relay the line with steel rails to railway standards. The land through which the line ran was generally flat, with the Oroua River the only serious obstacle. It was crossed with a 56 m bridge. The line was formally re-opened as a railway on 27 April 1876.|$|R
40|$|This {{spring was}} {{characterized}} {{by a lack of}} significant ornithological events, although readers will find tidbits of interest under the following species: Greater White-fronted Goose, Mandarin Duck (believe it or not), Common Merganser, Peregrine Falcon, Buff-breasted Sandpiper, Great Horned Owl, and Blue-winged Warbler. A significant concentration of warblers and flycatchers was detected at Walnut Grove Park in Omaha in late May; check the species accounts for details. The restoration of prairie grasslands at Boyer Chute NWR seems to be paying off; Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrows</b> were found there this spring for the first time. There were several new high counts, with perhaps the most intriguing counts being 28 Snowy Egrets; 200, 000 Common Mergansers (described by the observer as a 2 ̆ 2 wild guess, 2 ̆ 2 but not unprecedented); 118 Mountain Plovers; 86 Spotted Sandpipers; 372 Sanderlings; 2, 490 American Crows; 50 + Rock Wrens; and 18 Summer Tanagers. The 343 Buff-breasted Sandpipers counted at one spot in the Rainwater Basin constituted 2...|$|R
40|$|The Belding 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrow</b> is a {{subspecies}} of the Savannah Sparrow {{that occurs}} only in isolated patches of Salicornia marsh habitat between Goleta, Cal- ifornia and El Rosario Lagoon, Baja California Norte. Song samples {{were obtained from}} 14 local populations during 1973 and 7 populations were resampled during 1987 / 88. Turnover in the element lexicon of each population was low. A few elements changed in their proportional occurrence rate. During the initial survey {{it was noted that}} certain song types were common among males at any one locality. After 1 5 or 1 6 years the most common (popular) types in some populations remain dominant. At other localities types have changed in popularity. Sequence com- parison analysis of elements within songs was conducted to produce an objective inter-song dissimilarity matrix. This analysis revealed that song variation within local populations is much less extensive than among populations. The features used to define the original dialects remain distinctive of the local populations...|$|R
40|$|Since 1979, North Dakota 2 ̆ 7 s bird records {{committee}} has collected, evaluated, and archived documentations of rare bird occurrences in the state. In 2002 and 2003 this committee resolved 202 rare bird records. On {{the basis of}} this review, seven species were added to the North Dakota state bird list: common crane (Grus grus), lesser black-backed gull (Larus juscus), acorn woodpecker (Melanerpes jormicivorus), plumbeous vireo (Vireo plumbeus), Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus), prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor), and Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s finch (Carpodacus cassinii). Evidence was accepted that established Northern saw-whet owl (Aegolius acadicus), common poorwill (Phalaenoptilus nuttallii), and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Ammodramus henslowii) as breeding species. In addition, the committee accepted documentation regarding the state 2 ̆ 7 s first Selasphorus sp. hummingbird and 2 ̆ 2 Brewster 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 warbler (Vermivora pinus x V. chrysoptera). Based on the records reviewed, we recommend changes in the recognized status of 37 avian species...|$|R
40|$|First of all, I want {{to thank}} Joel Jorgensen for helping write these reports {{for the last few}} years. Joel has decided to spend his limited free time on Records Committee matters; he is {{currently}} Chairman. Over the last few years, Joel has made significant contributions to Nebraska ornithology, particularly through his! meticulous counts of shorebirds in the Rainwater Basin. This season proved interesting in terms of ranges of breeding birds, as discussed in the accounts. See, for example, Little Blue Heron, the dOWitchers. Black-billed Magpie, White-breasted Nuthatch, Sedge Wren, and the towhees. There seems to be an increasing number of 2 ̆ 2 displaced 2 ̆ 2 birds, either early or late 2 ̆ 7 migrants or birds just in the wrong places. Could this situation result from an increasingly unstable atmosphere? Very late in spring were Hudsonian Godwit and Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler, while very early in fall were Willet, Semipalmated Sandpiper. and Orange-crowned Warbler. Birds in the wrong places were numerous, but significant were a 2 ̆ 2 small race 2 ̆ 2 Canada Goose, ducks such as American Wigeon. Green-winged Teal, Bufflehead, and Common Goldeneye, Mississippi Kite away from Ogallala, adult Golden Eagle eastward, adult American Golden-Plover in July. westerly Least Terns, northerly Acadian Flycatcher, singing mid-June Blue-winged Warblers, Yellow-breasted Chats in Harlan Co, and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrow</b> in the RWB. Interesting breeding or possible breeding records involved Eurasian Collared Dove 2 ̆ 7 s 2 nd breeding location, Long-eared Owl, Pileated Woodpecker, Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Solitaire, and MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 s Warbler. 2 ̆ 2 Good birds 2 ̆ 2 were King Rail, Lewis 2 ̆ 7 s Woodpecker, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcracker, Hooded Warbler, and Cassin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrow,</b> and, best till last, the White Ibis, only the state 2 ̆ 7 s 3 rd report, but first with extant documentation. Finally, where were the Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sandpipers? When was the last time only one was reported for the early fall? Presumably the adults went elsewhere...|$|R
5|$|Between 1892 and 1895 the Agapemonites {{built the}} Church of the Good Shepherd in Upper Clapton, London. It was {{designed}} by Joseph Morris in a Gothic style. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, {{the outside of the}} church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, look out over the four quarters of the Earth {{from the base of the}} steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to William Blake's Jerusalem depicting, as they do, a fiery chariot and a sheaf of arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator Walter Crane, and made by J. <b>S.</b> <b>Sparrow,</b> betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'. The church was abandoned after 1956 and now is used by the Georgian Orthodox Church.|$|R
