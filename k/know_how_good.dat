500|$|After {{talking with}} Australian cricketer Shane Warne, Bolt {{suggested}} {{that if he were}} able to get time off he would be interested in playing in the cricket Big Bash League. Melbourne Stars chief executive Clint Cooper said there were free spots on his team should be available. Bolt stated that he enjoyed the Twenty20 version of the game, admiring the aggressive and constant nature of the batting.

500|$|Williams {{warned the}} Beatles about the {{competition}} they would face by {{playing in the}} same club as the Hurricanes by saying, [...] "You'd better pull your socks up because Rory Storm and the Hurricanes are coming in, and you <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>good</b> they are. They're going to knock you for six." [...] In early October 1960, Storm and the Hurricanes were free to travel to Hamburg, replacing Derry and the Seniors at the Kaiserkeller. They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than the Seniors or the Beatles. They played five or six 90-minute sets every day, alternating with the Beatles. They were appalled at the living conditions the Beatles and other groups like Howie Casey and the Seniors (who were sleeping in one room {{at the back of}} the Kaiserkeller) had to put up with, so they booked into Hamburg's Seamens' Mission.|$|E

It felt like the right thing for him." [...] However, in another interview, Knight said of his exit: [...] "My five-year experience proved to me that I could not trust any answer that was given [...]" [...] Knight was [...] "at peace" [...] with his departure, saying: [...] "There just comes a time when it's so clear that moving on is the best decision." [...] However, Heigl tried to talk Knight out of leaving, saying: [...] "I didn't think it was the right decision. I felt like some of the problems could be worked through. But by the time it came to fruition, I was [...] for him because he was ready to go." [...] On the topic of losing a US$14 million contract, Knight commented: [...] "From an outsider's perspective, I get the [...] 'He's just a spoiled actor, he doesn’t <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>good</b> he has it.' There are a lot of people who would like to be in my position. But in the end, I need to be fulfilled in my work." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 5, California Chrome {{entered the}} Breeders' Cup Classic {{as a strong}} {{favorite}} over Travers Stakes winner Arrogate. [...] Chrome led from the outset, tracked by Arrogate. [...] The two horses engaged in the homestretch and in the final yards, Arrogate surged ahead to defeat California Chrome by a neck at the finish. The two horses dominated {{the remainder of the}} field by over 10 lengths. [...] Critics of the race and Espinoza himself speculated that the loss was because Espinoza had failed to make his move and establish a large enough lead earlier in the race. [...] Sherman also wondered if Espinoza could have opened up a bigger lead, but he was unsure if it would have mattered: [...] "That winner is the real McCoy, I knew he was the one we had to beat, but I didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>good</b> he was," [...] he said. While the horse came out of the race in good shape, the press asked Raul Rodriquez if the horse [...] "knew" [...] that he had lost the race, and the groom replied, [...] "oh yeah." [...] Post race analysis gave California Chrome a Beyer Speed Figure of 119, the highest of his career, topped by 120 for Arrogate.|$|E
500|$|Pete Wentz {{was once}} again the primary lyricist of the band during the {{production}} of the album. Stump said that Wentz [...] "totally outdid himself on this record. He doesn't even <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>good</b> his lyrics are here." [...] Wentz, despite many recent personal developments (marriage to Ashlee Simpson, birth of his son, Bronx), desired to shift the focus away from himself and turn it outward onto the world. For the first time on a Fall Out Boy album, Folie is rarely autobiographical, as the band believed the format was [...] "losing its luster" [...] because [...] "everyone was doing it." [...] The songs on the album explore decaying relationships, moral dilemmas, and societal shortcomings, as well as concepts such as trust, infidelity, responsibility, and commitment. Stump tagged Folie à Deux as a [...] "message record" [...] that takes aim at [...] "the materialistic dance between any two parties obsessed with each other, whether it's teenage girls and handbag makers, politicians and lobbyists or tabloids and stars." [...] Folie à Deux also dissects how self-motivated American culture is, and many of the lyrics are intended to be satirical. While the album does contain political overtones, the band wanted to avoid being overt about these themes, leaving many lyrics open to interpretation for listeners.|$|E

500|$|Five and a {{half months}} after his last start, American Pharoah began his second season in the Grade II Rebel Stakes on a sloppy track at Oaklawn Park on March 14. He carried top weight of 119 pounds and started as the 2–5 {{favorite}} against six opponents, headed by the Todd Pletcher-trained Madefromlucky. The colt led from the start and drew away in the closing stages to win by six and a quarter lengths. Espinoza called the winner [...] "an amazing horse", while Baffert was satisfied with the run, especially as the colt returned with a twisted shoe which would have hampered his progress. Four weeks later at the same track, American Pharoah started as the odds-on favorite against seven opponents in the Grade I Arkansas Derby. After racing in second place behind outsider Bridget's Big Luvy, he took the lead {{a quarter of a mile}} from the finish and steadily increased his advantage to win by eight lengths from Southwest Stakes winner Far Right. Baffert noted, [...] "He's matured substantially. He's a good horse and he keeps moving forward. I don't want to get ahead of myself, but Dortmund is another one who we don't yet <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>good</b> he is. We've got a one-two punch and that's a good position to be in." [...] After the race, Ron Moquett, the trainer of runner-up Far Right, described American Pharoah as [...] "a superhorse".|$|E
2500|$|From March 1960 {{until about}} 1967 (some sources give 1968), Tracey was the house pianist at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in Soho, London, {{and he had}} the {{opportunity}} to accompany many of the leading musicians from the US who visited the club. Recordings of some of these performances appeared on LP and others have appeared in recent years on the Jazz House and Harkit labels, recorded by the journalist Les Tomkins, but with non-professional sound quality. In this context he gained some high-profile admirers; Sonny Rollins asserted at one concert: [...] "Does anyone here <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>good</b> he is?". It is Tracey on piano that film viewers hear behind Rollins on the soundtrack of the Michael Caine version of Alfie (1966).|$|E
2500|$|Johnson is {{considered}} {{a master of the}} blues, particularly of the Delta blues style. Keith Richards, of the Rolling Stones, said in 1990, [...] "You want to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>good</b> the blues can get? Well, this is it." [...] But according to Elijah Wald, in his book Escaping the Delta, Johnson in his own time was most respected for his ability to play {{in a wide range of}} styles, from raw country slide guitar to jazz and pop licks, and for his ability to pick up guitar parts almost instantly upon hearing a song. His first recorded song, [...] "Kind Hearted Woman Blues," [...] in contrast to the prevailing Delta style of the time, more resembled the style of Chicago or St. Louis, with [...] "a full-fledged, abundantly varied musical arrangement." [...] Unusual for a Delta player of the time, a recording exhibits what Johnson could do entirely outside of a blues style. [...] "They're Red Hot", from his first recording session, shows that he was also comfortable with an [...] "uptown" [...] swing or ragtime sound similar to that of the Harlem Hamfats, but as Wald remarked, [...] "no record company was heading to Mississippi in search of a down-home Ink Spots ... e could undoubtedly have come up with a lot more songs in this style if the producers had wanted them."

2500|$|The 1981 Tampa Bay Buccaneers {{season began}} with the team trying to improve on an 5–10–1 season. The team was {{considered}} to be superior to the 1979 team that finished the season one game shy of the Super Bowl. With the running game and special teams ineffective, the Buccaneers depended heavily on the pass, and particularly on the big play. Jimmie Giles returned to form, establishing numerous team receiving records. Doug Williams became (with Jim Zorn) the second active quarterback to need only four seasons to reach the 10,000 career passing yards mark. The defense improved over the previous season, a change that McKay attributed to less reliance on blitzes, and a general improvement in speed due to changes in the secondary and the drafting of Hugh Green. Their defense allowed the fewest touchdowns of any NFL team, and was described by opponents as [...] "outstanding" [...] and [...] "almost awesome". The team was dogged by inconsistent play throughout the season. Players and coaches believed the Buccaneers to be a playoff-worthy team, but a tendency to self-destruct kept them {{on the edge of the}} playoff race, thanks in part to a failure of any other team to take control in either the NFC Central division or the NFC wild-card chase. [...] "We make more mistakes at crucial times than any team I've ever been associated with", said ex-Buckeyes, -Raiders, and -Dolphins safety Neal Colzie. Opposing coach Dick Vermeil said, [...] "I'm not sure they <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>good</b> they are", after his Philadelphia Eagles team beat the Buccaneers despite having been outplayed. Nevertheless, the team developed a maturity through the season which allowed them to remain competitive instead of collapsing when behind or when being outplayed.|$|E
