40|$|Methods of {{decreasing}} the <b>fog</b> <b>density</b> level in an autoradiographically intensified image were investigated. The methods included a more proportional conversion of silver to silver sulfide, {{decreasing the}} amount of fog silver in the original image, and minimizing the formation of fog in the original image. Thirty percent exposures of an aluminum 11 step wedge and a lead resolution target were made using Kodak film type XG- 1. The underexposed films were either developed in the Kodak RP X-Omat processor or manually developed. All the films were radioactivated in an alkaline solution of sulfur- 35 thiourea for 30 minutes. The activated films were exposed to Kodak film type NMC in a radiographic cassette for a specified period of time. The resulting autoradiographs were developed in the X-Omat processor. A more proportional conversion of silver to radioactive silver sulfide was obtained by increasing {{the amount of}} nonradioactive thiourea in the activating solution. The addition of 0. 0014 g. of nonradioactive thiourea resulted in a 70 % decrease in the <b>fog</b> <b>density</b> of the autoradiograph and a 40 % increase in gamma, but at the expense of a 40 % decrease in ASA speed. The use of potassium ferricyanide as an oxidizing agent during the radioactivation resulted in increased <b>fog</b> <b>density,</b> while the use of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent produced little or no effect on the intensification. Manually developing the underexposed image for a shorter period of time (1 min. instead of 3 min.) resulted in decreased fog from a density of 1. 31 to 0. 58 and increased contrast from 1. 2 to 2. 2, while the ASA speed remained unchanged in the intensified image.

40|$|Abstract — Bad weather, {{particularly}} fog and haze, commonly obstruct drivers from observing road conditions. This could frequently lead to {{a considerable}} number of road accidents. To avoid the problem, automatic methods have been proposed to enhance visibility in bad weather. Methods that work on visible wavelengths, based on the type of their input, can be categorized into two approaches: those using polarizing filters, and those using images taken from different <b>fog</b> <b>densities.</b> Both of the approaches require that the images are multiple and taken from exactly the same point of view. While they can produce reasonably good results, their requirement makes them impractical, particularly in real time applications, such as vehicle systems. Considering their drawbacks, our goal is to develop a method that requires solely a single image taken from ordinary digital cameras, without any additional hardware. The method principally uses color and intensity information. It enhances the visibility after estimating the color of skylight and the values of airlight. The experimental results on real images show the effectiveness of the approach. I...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the sensitometric {{properties}} of commonly used radiographic films processed with chemical solutions in different workload hospitals. The effect of different processing conditions on induced densities on radiologic films was investigated. Two accessible double emulsions Fuji and Kodak films were exposed with 11 -step wedge and processed with Champion and CPAC processing solutions. The mentioned films provided in both workloads centers, high and low. Our findings displays that the speed and contrast of Kodak film-screen in both work load (high and low) is higher than Fuji film-screen for both processing solutions. However there was significant differences (p= 0. 000 and 0. 028) in films contrast for both workloads when CPAC solution had been used. The results showed base plus <b>fog</b> <b>density</b> for Kodak film was lower than Fuji. Generally Champion processing solution caused more speed and contrast for investigated films in different conditions and there was significant difference(p= 0. 01) in 95 % confidence level between two used processing solutions. Low base plus <b>fog</b> <b>density</b> for Kodak films provide more visibility and accuracy and higher contrast results in using lower exposure factors to obtain better quality in resulting radiographs. In this study we found an economic advantages since Champion solution and Kodak film are used while it makes lower patient dose.

In experiment 1, twenty-five drivers in a wrap-around simulator drove urban and rural routes while performing a phone number read-back task. Visual displays were located either in a HUD overlaid on the horizon, a HUD positioned 7 ° below the horizon, or on a head-down display (HDD) located near the mid-console.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is the {{modeling}} of the denebulization of fogs by micronic hygroscopic particles from the initial seeding to the fall of the rain droplets on the ground. The microparticles generated by flares are made of hygroscopic salts. Three stages occur: first, the condensation of water vapor on solid particles, this is the deliquescent stage which is very fast and can be ignored by the model, then the stage of condensation of water vapor on liquid salted particles / evaporation of fog droplets and finally the coalescence stage when the liquid salted particles diameter become large enough. Three different salts have been tested: NaCl, CaCl 2 and KCl. The 1 -D modeling approach studied considers the conservation equations (salt mass, water mass, salted droplets number <b>density,</b> <b>fog</b> droplets number <b>density),</b> the hygroscopicity of the salts through the water activity in the aqueous solution and the coalescence induced by gravity. The model reveals that NaCl is the most efficient salt because of its stronger hygroscopicity at high dilution rates although CaCl 2 is the more hygroscopic at low dilution rates. A cloud of NaCl particles of 9 μm diameter initially generated over a height of about 7 m with a number density of 12 cm− 3 allows to completely dissipates a typical fog layer of 40 m within less than 13 mn. This means that 10 kg of NaCl particles could be able to clear such a fog over 13. 25 ha. The model shows that a layer of 100 m can be cleared within 29 mn.

The fog level of intensified images of a step wedge decreased from a density of 1. 32 to. 12, the maximum contrast increased from 2. 08 to 5. 52, the relative speed increase calculated at 0. 6 above fog level increased from 3. 05 to 4. 06 while resolution remained the same at 5. 0 lines per millimeter. Radiographs of underexposed images were recovered by using this autoradiographic image intensification method. The underexposed radiograph {{was developed in the}} conventional manner using the Kodak X-Omat processor and treated in the subproportional photographic reducer to lower the <b>fog</b> <b>density.</b> The silver image of the underexposed radiograph was made radioactive with a solution of sulfur- 35 thiourea, air-dried and exposed to another emulsion. The intensified image was also developed in the conventional manner.

Of the six underexposed radiographs involving various body regions studied following intensification, five were consistently rated adequate. This technique, when fully developed and applied will result in reduced radiation dose to patients undergoing radiologic examinations. A significant difference exists between the intensified image of a double-coated and single-coated emulsion.

40|$|Introduction: Due to {{ever-increasing}} {{need for}} diagnostic radiographs in dentistry, {{it is necessary}} to observe techniques to minimize the absorbed patient dose. The aim of this study was the comparative evaluation of inherent visual characteristics such as contrast and density and the gross fog of standard occlusal films with those of occlusal films taken with intensifying screens. Materials and Methods: In this experimental research, standard occlusal films and occlusal films prepared by cutting extraoral films to the size of occlusal films and placing them between intensifying screens were used. After determination of the most appropriate exposure time and maximum kVp and mA, radiographs were taken from one step wedge and processed using the same condition. A total of 25 radiographs were taken from each of the two film types and then the radiographs underwent densitometry at similar points. In order to evaluate the gross fog, densitometry was carried out at 5 similar points on one unexposed film from each type. Data were analyzed using SPSS 11. 5 software and Mann-Whitney test (α = 0. 05). Results: Based on the results of this study, the density of the standard occlusal film was more than that of the occlusal film with intensifying screens (p value < 0. 001). The contrast of the film with intensifying screens was more than that of the standard occlusal film (p value < 0. 001). The gross fog of the film with intensifying screens was less than that of the standard occlusal film (p value = 0. 006). Conclusion: Occlusal films with intensifying screens have higher contrast and lower gross <b>fog</b> and <b>density,</b> but in the diagnostic range, in comparison with standard occlusal films; therefore, films with intensifying screens are recommended because they decrease patient absorbed dose by decreasing exposure time.

When fog is present, extinction by the water or ice particles depends upon the wavelength of the propagating energy, the com-plex index of refraction of the particles for that wavelength, and the particle-size dis-tribution. This paper summarizes a thorough survey {{of the literature on}} fog drop-size dis-tributions throughout the world. A representative sample of data is selected for use in computations of the extinction of 10. 6, 870, and 1250 pm by numerous fogs. Attenuation by fog drops is much greater near 10 pm than near one millimeter. Computations made with German data show that attenuation of liquid plus vapor is smallest for 1250 pm in <b>fogs</b> of different <b>densities</b> in all seasons. In very dense German fogs, 10. 6 pm has the largest attenuation in all seasons. In spring, summer, and autumn attenuations of 10. 6 pm and 870 pm in moderate fogs are the same order of magnitude...|$|R
