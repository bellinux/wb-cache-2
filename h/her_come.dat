5|$|Reviewer Jennifer Malkowski {{feels that}} Lana {{is one of}} the most gullible {{characters}} on television. According to Malkowski, Lana's strong feminist stance, and her request that people should stop protecting her and start telling her the truth, are diluted by her willingness to believe whatever pieces of information she gets, even if they are lies. After the series ended, Gough and Millar expressed regret with Lana's characterization throughout the course of the show, which they felt damaged Lana in the audiences' mind. Gough and Millar believed that Lana's behavior toward Clark (for refusing to reveal his secret) made <b>her</b> <b>come</b> across as cold and unsympathetic.|$|E

25|$|The subtitle, A Novel {{without a}} Hero, is apt because the {{characters}} are all flawed {{to a greater or}} lesser degree; even the most sympathetic have weaknesses, for example Captain Dobbin, who is prone to vanity and melancholy. The human weaknesses Thackeray illustrates are mostly to do with greed, idleness, and snobbery, and the scheming, deceit and hypocrisy which mask them. None of {{the characters are}} wholly evil, although Becky's manipulative, amoral tendencies make <b>her</b> <b>come</b> pretty close. However, even Becky, who is amoral and cunning, is thrown on her own resources by poverty and its stigma. (She is the orphaned daughter of a poor artist and an opera dancer.) Thackeray's tendency to highlight faults in all of his characters displays his desire for a greater level of realism in his fiction compared to the rather unlikely or idealised people in many contemporary novels.|$|E

25|$|Woodwind and harp {{accompany}} a pensive {{version of}} the 'Dmitriy Motif'. The Pretender dreams of an assignation with Marina {{in the garden of}} her father's castle. However, to his annoyance, Rangoni finds him. He brings news that Marina longs for him and wishes to speak with him. The Pretender resolves to throw himself at Marina's feet, begging her to be his wife and Tsaritsa. He entreats Rangoni to lead him to Marina. Rangoni, however, first begs the Pretender to consider him a father, allowing him to follow his every step and thought. Despite his mistrust of Rangoni, the Pretender agrees not to part from him if he will only let him see Marina. Rangoni convinces the Pretender to hide as the Polish nobles emerge from the castle dancing a polonaise (Polonaise). Marina flirts, dancing with an older man. The Poles sing of taking the Muscovite throne, defeating the army of Boris, and capturing him. They return to the castle. The Pretender comes out of hiding, cursing Rangoni. He resolves to abandon wooing Marina and begin his march on Moscow. But then Marina appears and calls to him. He is lovesick. She, however, only wants to know when he will be Tsar, and declares she can only be seduced by a throne and a crown. The Pretender kneels at her feet. She rejects his advances, and, attempting to spur him to action, dismisses him, calling him a lackey. Having reached his limit, he tells her he will depart the next day to lead his army to Moscow and to his father's throne. Furthermore, as Tsar he will take pleasure in watching <b>her</b> <b>come</b> crawling back looking for her own lost throne, and will command everyone to laugh at her. She quickly reverses course, tells him she adores him, and they sing a duet ("O Tsarevich, I implore you"). Rangoni observes the amorous couple from afar, and, joining them in a brief trio, cynically rejoices in his victory.|$|E

[...] Tereus agreed to travel to Athens and escort her sister, Philomela, to Thrace. King Pandion of Athens, the father of Philomela and Procne, was apprehensive about letting his one remaining daughter leave his home and protection and asks Tereus to protect her {{as if he were}} her father. Tereus agrees. However, Tereus lusted for Philomela when he first saw her, and that lust grew {{during the course of the}} return voyage to Thrace.|$|E
500|$|Information about Onneca's life is limited. Biographical {{details about}} <b>her</b> <b>come</b> from two main sources: the Roda Codex and the {{accounts}} of Muslim Andalusi historians, who refer to Onneca by the Arabic name Durr (...) , meaning [...] "pearl". Onneca is primarily known for marrying into the Umayyad dynasty. Although matrimonial unions between Christian slave-concubines and Muslim rulers were common, Onneca's case {{is one of the}} few examples of a Christian princess marrying into Muslim royalty. Her marriage created family ties between the Christian and Muslim ruling families of the Iberian peninsula, initially leading to close collaboration between the Christian House of Íñiguez and the Muslim Umayyads. The political effects resulting from Onneca's marriages continued to be felt long after her death, which occurred at an unknown date.|$|E

500|$|Bruckman's cryptic {{prediction}} that Scully would not die [...] "sent fans into a frenzy" [...] {{due to its}} implications. Morgan explained that the line merely was a reference to Bruckman knowing how Scully would die, but liking her too much to divulge the information. However, many interpreted the warning to mean that Scully could not actually die and was, in essence, immortal. This interpretation, popular with fans on the internet, was verified by Frank Spotnitz. [...] However, Spotnitz later admitted that this sub-plot was bookended by the sixth season episode [...] "Tithonus," [...] which showed Scully starting to die, only to have <b>her</b> <b>come</b> back, fulfilling Bruckman's prophecy. Spotnitz later called this ending [...] "very satisfying." [...] Series creator Chris Carter, however, stated in a 2014 reddit AMA that Scully is in fact, immortal.|$|E
500|$|... "Not Pictured" [...] {{would mark}} the final {{appearance}} by series regular Jackie Cook (Tessa Thompson). When asked whether Jackie {{was done with}} the show, Thomas replied, [...] "She is. I would not hesitate for a second to have <b>her</b> <b>come</b> in to do an arc, but she will not be a series regular." [...] One notable recurring character absence in the finale is that of Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Ritter wanted to appear in the episode, but she was unable to do so because of scheduling conflicts. [...] "It was unfortunate for me that I couldn't be in the finale episode (I booked a pilot) because I was looking forward to showing how everything that went down affected her. On a side note, I did start to think that I was responsible for the crash. I really wanted her to be a bad guy." [...] She would later appear in the Veronica Mars movie.|$|E

If fans had simply accepted her death, that would have meant she wasn't an effective character." [...] From the original release of the game, rumors have circulated that Aerith can be resurrected in or that the original plan was to have <b>her</b> <b>come</b> back, but this was scrapped in development. Nomura has categorically stated that neither of these rumors were ever true; [...] "the world was expecting us {{to bring her back}} to life, as this is the classic convention." [...] A lengthy petition asking for Aerith's revival by Japanese players was sent to Kitase, but he dismissed it, pointing out that [...] "there are many meanings in Aerith's death and [...] could never happen." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{people of}} the Marshall Islands {{featured}} Auriga in the myth of Dümur, which {{tells the story of}} the creation of the sky. Antares in Scorpius represents Dümur, the oldest son of the stars' mother, and the Pleiades represent her youngest son. The mother of the stars, Ligedaner, is represented by Capella; she lived on the island of Alinablab. She told her sons that the first to reach an eastern island would become the King of the Stars, and asked Dümur to let <b>her</b> <b>come</b> in his canoe. He refused, as did each of her sons in turn, except for Pleiades. Pleiades won the race with the help of Ligedaner, and became the King of the Stars. Elsewhere in the central Caroline Islands, Capella was called Jefegen uun (variations include efang alul, evang-el-ul, and iefangel uul), meaning [...] "north of Aldebaran". Different names were noted for Auriga and Capella in Eastern Pacific societies. On Pukapuka, the figure of modern Auriga was called Te Wale-o-Tutakaiolo ("The house of Tutakaiolo"); in the Society Islands, it was called Faa-nui ("Great Valley"). Capella itself was called Tahi-anii ("Unique Sovereign") in the Societies. Hoku-lei was the name for Capella but may have been the name for the whole constellation; the name means [...] "Star-wreath" [...] and refers to one of the wives of the Pleiades, called Makalii.|$|E
500|$|Fun Home {{has several}} themes {{recurring}} throughout the book. The biggest theme, arguably, is sexual orientation. Bechdel tells {{the readers of}} her journey of discovering her own sexuality through books. [...] "My realization at nineteen that I was a lesbian came about {{in a manner consistent}} with my bookish upbringing." [...] Her exposure (from reading literal definitions in dictionaries, reading interviews of others like her, etc.) helped <b>her</b> <b>come</b> to terms with her sexuality, but in truth, the hints of it plagued her childhood: her desire [...] "for the right to exchange [...] tank suit for a pair of shorts" [...] in Cannes" [...] or her desire for her brothers to call her Albert instead of Alison on one camping trip. [...] However, Bechdel also reveals that she wasn't alone in her choice of partners; her father also exhibited some homosexual behaviors, but in a different way than Alison. [...] "I'd been upstaged, demoted from protagonist in my own drama to comic relief in my parents' tragedy" [...] when her mother reveals Bechdel's father's secret. Though both, father and daughter, had similar situations (Bechdel was a lesbian while her father was gay or bisexual), the two handled their issues differently. Bechdel chose to accept the fact and not hide from the issue, taking a female partner and going to [...] "gay union" [...] meetings when she was a student at Oberlin College. Bechdel was open about her sexuality before she'd even been in a same-sex relationship (of any sort). Her father, on the other hand, had had countless affairs with men but wasn't open about it. [...] This may be due to homophobia (his and/or others'), or because he was married with a family. In any case, it is clear that he is afraid of coming out, as illustrated by [...] "the fear in his eyes" [...] when the conversation topic is dangerously close to homosexuality.|$|E
