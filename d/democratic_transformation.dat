The talks ended in disagreement. During a conference of Solidarity's National Commission (a central representative policy making body) that followed, Modzelewski, Kuroń and others proposed a <b>democratic</b> <b>transformation</b> and practical arrangements by which the Union would take upon itself a major political role, participating in governing the country, accepting responsibility for the outcome and keeping social peace, thus relieving the (still) ruling party {{of some of its}} burdens. Such a deal was seen as the only constructive way forward, but it would require government partners interested in a negotiated solution.|$|E

As the number of supporters for his ideas grew, so did opposition among the leading Social Democrats like the Menshevik Noe Zhordania; their main aims were focused on battling the Tsarist autocracy and a <b>democratic</b> <b>transformation</b> of the Russian empire. This did not include the revival of a Georgian state or of a Georgian self-identity. Ilia was viewed as bourgeois and as an old aristocrat who failed to realize the importance of the revolutionary tide.|$|E

In contrast to the power resources at the disposal of other regional powers, including the support of external powers, sectarian identities, or ethnic-linguistic ties, the key asset of Turkish foreign policy is its successful combination of democracy and Islam. Utilizing this image, Turkey has emerged as the most outspoken supporter of <b>democratic</b> <b>transformations,</b> aiming to create a liberaldemocratic regional order. This, however, brings Turkey ultimately into conflict with other aspiring hegemonic powers, including both Israel and Iran. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|According to Beck's 'World at Risk' theory, global risks push nations {{towards a}} cosmopolitisation {{of their health}} policy and open {{opportunities}} for a democratic turn. This article provides an empirical analysis of Beck's theory, based {{on the experience of}} Vietnamese authorities from 2003 to 2007 in managing the emerging avian flu virus. It shows how Vietnam's framing of avian flu has shifted, under the pressure from international organisations and the US administration, from an epizootic and zoonotic risk (or a classic risk) to a pandemic threat (or a late modern risk). Vietnam's response was part of its overall strategy to join the World Trade Organization and it was limited by Vietnam's defence of its sovereignty. This strategy has been successful for Vietnam but has limited the possibility of cosmopolitan and <b>democratic</b> <b>transformations.</b> The case study highlights the constructed dimension of risks of late modernity and their possible instrumentalisation: it minimises the role of a community of fear relative to a community of trade.

40|$|The article {{highlights}} the psychological basis of {{formation of a}} person as a subject of public and political life of a democratic state. The author’s interpretation of the essence of democracy is given, which includes the adoption of democratic values (freedom, equality, justice, solidarity), awareness of the capabilities and value of self-selection, critical perception of socio-political information, active attitude {{to the need to}} participate in the <b>democratic</b> <b>transformations,</b> readiness for cooperation with governmental authorities and local governments to improve life {{of the state and the}} local community. The culture of a person’s democracy is regarded as a phenomenon of social and power relations based on the self-determination, self-realization and self-development in the conditions of a civil society. It is noted that self-actualization (self-determination and self-realization) of the individual takes place in the course of one’s own socialization. The process of self-identification as a specially organized activity that aims at self-expression, self-determination, self-understanding, self-acceptance, self-awareness of integrity, uniqueness, value is analyzed here...|$|R
40|$|The {{collapse}} of communism has had an enormous influence {{on the development of}} Central and Eastern European states. Although, the transition period in these countries was accompanied by several distinctive features, all these states had a general orientation to the west. This was the case in Romania too, which saw transition to democracy as a "return to Europe", and specifically accession to the European Union. The author strongly believes that the leitmotif of <b>democratic</b> <b>transformations</b> in Romania is its orientation and accession to the European Union, which is why the author will investigate its impact on constitutional reforms in the country. However, it is beyond the framework of this article to cover all areas of social, political and economic life of Romania, where there have been significant changes {{as a result of the}} EU's influence, so I have focused only on minority rights, as this issue is very important for maintaining stability and democracy in the region...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} elites {{has always been}} {{controversial}} in Latin American social sciences. Elites have been studied indirectly as landowners, capitalists, business-leaders or politicians, and have also been approached directly using concepts and theory from elite studies. Although {{there is a significant}} amount of literature on the role of elites in <b>democratic</b> <b>transformations</b> (see e. g. Higley and Gunther, 1992), elites have often been considered to be an obstacle to the formation of more democratic, prosperous and egalitarian societies (e. g. Paige, 1997; Cimoli and Rovira, 2008). This is also the case in the literature on environmental governance, in which elite groups are often considered to be an obstacle to sustainable development and an obstacle to establishing more equitable influence over the use and benefits of natural resources. Therefore, although an elitist conservation movement has long existed in Latin America, struggles to protect the environment from overexploitation and contamination have commonly been related to struggles against local, national and transnational elites by subaltern groups (Martínez-Alier, 2002; Carruthers, 2008; chapters 1 and 2 in this volume) ...|$|R
40|$|Turkey {{has been}} {{undergoing}} major <b>democratic</b> <b>transformations</b> in recent years, but one issue remains in question: {{the role of}} the military. Have these democratic changes also included an irreversible, structural change for the Turkish military's political role? Are the Turks reconceptualizing their special bond with the armed forces and most importantly, is the military leadership ready to go along with this paradigm shift? This article first provides a typology of civil-military relations worldwide and identifies the main parameters of traditional Turkish civil-military relations as a system in which society maintains a direct, special bond with its military, keeping politics and politicians in a secondary position. It then suggests that this pattern is shifting into a more democratic one, in which society places its trust in politics, thus forcing the military into the secondary position. It then analyzes the discourse and policies of the last three Turkish Chiefs of Staff for evidence that the army is adapting into this paradigm shift. With the completion of this adaptation, Turkey may very well be leaving the coup era behind. © Middle East Institute...|$|R
