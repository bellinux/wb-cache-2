5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations {{that the}} combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes {{the eye is}} torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense,</b> according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E

25|$|Malfatti {{is thought}} to have been rather {{discouraged}} from her reception of her highly debated exposition and so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> that she would try to please her audience. However, at the same time, other artists such as Tarsila do Amaral were becoming highly evolved in their search for the Brazilian identity and culture. Although Malfatti's courage and formally trained style introduced a new development to Brazilians, she almost sacrificed her artistic career simply to pave the path for other artists to forge ahead. However she will always be celebrated as the artist who brought Modernism to Brazil and, as that is no small feat, her impact is legendary.|$|E
500|$|To {{achieve a}} greater variety of stories {{in the first half of}} series 6 [...] "Night Terrors" [...] was moved to the second block of episodes, having been filmed as episode four and showing up in promos for the first half of the season. This necessitated minor changes to the episode, {{including}} the removal of a recurring sequence featuring the appearance of Madame Kovarian. The original last scene was dropped, and a new one was written so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> at that point in the series. This scene consisted of nursery rhyme; lead writer Steven Moffat wanted to foreshadow the Doctor's death and asked Gatiss to write a nursery rhyme, which he described as [...] "rather wonderful". Variations of the rhyme are heard in [...] "Closing Time" [...] and the series finale [...] "The Wedding of River Song".|$|E
500|$|The lines by Pope, though {{referring}} to Theobald, {{the hero of}} The Dunciad, are a characterisation of a Grub Street hack, a stereotype popular in the 1730s denoting a man of limited writing ability who lived in poverty but nevertheless determinedly pursued a career in literature;, Therefore, the particular scribbler depicted in the painting {{would be one of}} this fraternity of [...] "witlings" [...] who banded together to protest Pope's poem. In this context <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense,</b> therefore, for the poet to have the scabrous anti-Pope print, or an emblem of Pope's fight with the hack writers' patron, above him. Just as Moll Hackabout has a picture of [...] Macheath on her wall in A Harlot's Progress, this aspiring and witless poet would have a picture of his hero, Edmund Curll, and an anti-Pope print.

2500|$|It {{was also}} {{realized}} that Fido systems were generally clustered – of the 15 systems running {{by the start of}} June 1984, 5 of them were in St. Louis. [...] A user on Jennings's system in San Francisco that addressed emails to different systems in St. Louis would cause calls to be made to each of those BBSes in turn. [...] Local calls were normally free or charged at a low rate. [...] Additionally, the initial call setup, generally the first minute of the call, was normally billed at a higher rate than continuing an existing connection. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> to deliver all the messages from all the users in San Francisco to all of the users in St. Louis in a single call. Packets were generally small enough to be delivered within a minute or two, so delivering all the messages in a single call could greatly reduce costs by avoiding multiple first-minute charges. Once delivered, the packet would be broken out into separate packets for local systems, and delivered using multiple local free calls.|$|E
