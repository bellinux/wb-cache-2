40|$|Genetic {{variation}} at the Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) genes {{is associated}} with many autoimmune and infectious disease phenotypes, is {{an important element of}} the immunological distinction between self and non-self, and shapes immune epitope repertoires. Determining the allelic state of the HLA genes (HLA typing) as a by-product of standard whole-genome sequencing data would therefore be highly desirable and enable the immunogenetic characterization of samples in currently ongoing population sequencing projects. Extensive hyperpolymorphism and sequence similarity between the HLA genes, however, pose problems for accurate read mapping and make HLA type inference from whole-genome sequencing data a challenging problem. We describe how to address these challenges in a Population Reference Graph (PRG) framework. First, we construct a PRG for 46 (mostly HLA) genes and pseudogenes, their genomic context and their characterized sequence variants, integrating a database of over 10, 000 known allele sequences. Second, we present a sequence-to-PRG paired-end read mapping algorithm that enables accurate read mapping for the HLA genes. Third, we infer the most likely pair of underlying alleles at G <b>group</b> <b>resolution</b> from the IMGT/HLA database at each locus, employing a simple likelihood framework. We show that HLA*PRG, our algorithm, outperforms existing methods by a wide margin. We evaluate HLA*PRG on six classical class I and class II HLA genes (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DQA 1, -DQB 1, -DRB 1) and on a set of 14 samples (3 samples with 2 x 100 bp, 11 samples with 2 x 250 bp Illumina HiSeq data). Of 158 alleles tested, we correctly infer 157 alleles (99. 4 %). We also identify and re-type two erroneous alleles in the original validation data. We conclude that HLA*PRG for the first time achieves accuracies comparable to gold-standard reference methods from standard whole-genome sequencing data, though high computational demands (currently ~ 30 - 250 CPU hours per sample) remain a significant challenge to practical application...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{considers}} the recent {{decline of the}} class action by comparing earlier, parallel developments in the law of business reorganizations. Until the 1930 s, the equity receivership was the procedural device used to reorganize firms in financial distress, because a receivership, like a class action, could achieve a binding <b>group</b> <b>resolution</b> among dispersed claimants. Although initially viewed favorably, the receivership came under sustained attacks from political, academic, and judicial critics. These critics, like today’s critics of the class action, challenged {{the legitimacy of the}} receivership process. In particular, they painted the lawyers in receivership cases as conflicted actors who placed their own interests above the interests of claimants — much as class action lawyers are sometimes portrayed. These criticisms led to bankruptcy reform legislation in the New Deal era that sharply constrained reorganization practice. Yet, the New Deal-era restrictions on reorganization practice were rejected a generation later with the adoption of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Article proposes two explanations for the revival of reorganization law after a generation in decline. First, the practical needs that had driven the development of the receivership as a device for resolving the financial distress of firms did not dissipate simply because that device was hobbled. Instead, lawyers and courts attempted to find other, more cumbersome and inefficient pathways for achieving the same ends. Second, the control and supervision of lawyers was integral to the revival of business reorganization practice. Partly out of concern about actually deterring lawyer misconduct and partly out of concern about addressing the perception of lawyer misconduct, those who worked to revive the bankruptcy system understood the need to include institutions that seek to check excessive influence by lawyers in the process. The Article draws on these developments to suggest possible routes for the future development of the class action and aggregate litigation more generally...|$|E

The following EA BP were compared: Dinitrophenylmercaptopropylsilica (DNPMP); dinitrodibenzoylmercaptopropylsilica (DNBMP); dinitroanilinopropylsilica (DNAP); dinitrobenzamidopropylsilica (DNBAP); tetranitrofluoreniminopropylsilica (TNFP); tetranitrodibenzosuberiminopropylsilica (TNDBSP); trinitrophenylmercaptopropylsilica (TNPMP); pentafluorophenylsilica (PFPh); aminopropylsilica (NH 2) and Nucleosil TM 5 -NO 2 (5 -NO 2). Entropy-enthalpy compensation {{data indicated that}} the mechanism of retention (first 6 BP) was the same for planar and nonplanar aromatic solutes, but it was less informative than the vector-analysis techniques of linear correlation coefficient and Euclidian distance calculations. The latter provided a quantitative comparison of the BP. All EA BP had close similarity except for TNFP. NH 2 and 5 -NO 2 were somewhat similar to the EA BP. PFPh was not similar to the other EA BP. The EA BP were also examined {{for their ability to}} group aromatic solutes of similar ring size regardless of alkyl substitution. A new performance parameter RΓ (<b>group</b> <b>resolution)</b> was proposed and applied to these data. Using the calculated values for RΓ, the group-resolution effectiveness of the various BP followed the sequence: DNAP ≫ DNPMP, TNPMP, 5 -NO 2 3 ̆e TNDBSP, DNBMP, DNBAP 3 ̆e NH 2 3 ̆e TNFP ≫ PFPh. Retention of aromatic solutes as a function of planarity was also investigated. DNPMP was found to be slightly better than DNAP at separating bridged biphenyls. DNPMP was packed into a 0. 32 -mm x 300 -mm microcapillary liquid chromatographic (μLC) column. The μLC system was interfaced with a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC-MS) by a ten-port switching valve with 50 and 7. 6 -μL loops.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of the Westinghouse work performed under Task 1 of this Financial Assistance Award and satisfies a Level 2 Milestone for the project. While most of the signals required for control of IPSRs are typical of other PWRs, the integral configuration poses some new challenges in the design or deployment of the sensors/instrumentation and, in some cases, requires completely new approaches. In response to this consideration, the overall objective of Task 1 was to establish the instrumentation needs for integral reactors, provide a review of the existing solutions where available, and, identify research and development needs to be addressed to enable successful deployment of IPSRs. The starting point for this study was to review and synthesize general characteristics of integral reactors, and then to focus on a specific design. Due to the maturity of its design and availability of design information to Westinghouse, IRIS (International Reactor Innovative and Secure) was selected for this purpose. The report is organized as follows. Section 1 is an overview. Section 2 provides background information on several representative IPSRs, including IRIS. A review of the IRIS safety features and its protection and control systems is used as a mechanism to ensure that all critical safety-related instrumentation needs are addressed in this study. Additionally, IRIS systems are compared against those of current advanced PWRs. The scope of this study is then limited to those systems where differences exist, since, otherwise, the current technology already provides an acceptable solution. Section 3 provides a detailed discussion on instrumentation needs for the representative IPSR (IRIS) with detailed qualitative and quantitative requirements summarized in the exhaustive table included as Appendix A. Section 3 also provides an evaluation of the current technology and the instrumentation used for measurement of required parameters in current PWRs. Section 4 examines those instrumentation/measurement needs where differences between IRIS and present PWRs exist and the current PWR implementation cannot be directly employed, and identifies two subcategories. In the first <b>group,</b> <b>resolution</b> can be readily identified, and is essentially an engineering solution (for example, modification of an existing approach, adaptation of existing instrument etc.).

40|$|Two main themes to the avian {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis are, 1. Deep resolution of birds generally, and 2. Investigation of specific aspects of the New Zealand avifauna. More specifically, this thesis covers phylogeny, and predictions about palaeognaths, pigeons, pelecaniforms and passerines. Significant progress is made in resolving the basal branches of Neoaves. This thesis examines whether the six-way basal Neoavian split of Cracraft (2001) is, in principle, resolvable. New mitochondrial genomes are added to improve taxon sampling, break up long branches, and allow testing of the prior assumptions of six Neoavian groups. This research shows the six-way split is resolvable, although more work is required for specific details. From a life-history perspective, {{it is interesting that}} the two bird-of-prey groups (falcons and buzzards) are very divergent, and may not be sister groups. Molecular dating supports major diversification of at least 12 Neoavian lineages in the Late Cretaceous. Additionally, novel avian mitochondrial gene orders are investigated and a hypothesis put forward suggesting gene conversion and stable intermediate forms allows an apparently rare event (gene rearrangement) to occur multiple times within Neoaves. One of Cracraft’s six groups, informally called the ‘Conglomerati’, is particularly difficult to resolve. The pigeons (Columbiformes) lie within the ‘Conglomerati’, and this chapter examines two aspects along the continuum of pigeon evolution. Firstly the large South Pacific fruit pigeon radiation is examined with mid-length mitochondrial sequences. This clade contains a third of all pigeon species, and has been very successful in island colonisation throughout South East Asia and the Pacific. Secondly, candidates for the closest relative of pigeons are tested using analysis of whole mitochondrial genomes. Highest support was found for the grouping of sandgrouse and pigeon, although they are clearly very divergent. Also within the ‘Conglomerati’ is the traditional order Pelecaniformes, and their close allies the Ciconiiformes. These orders (the P&C) are part of an adaptive radiation of seabird water-carnivores, including loons, penguins, petrels and albatrosses. This group is separate from the large shorebird water-carnivore group; although both appear to have begun radiating abut 70 million years ago. The tropicbird represents a separate, convergent life history and {{is not part of the}} Pelecaniformes, nor within the larger seabird water-carnivore <b>group.</b> <b>Resolution</b> of the basal phylogeny of oscine passerines is important for interpreting the radiation of this group out of the Australasian region. Many endemic New Zealand oscine passerines belong to ‘basal corvid’ lineages, but have not previously been investigated with mitochondrial DNA. This chapter shows that many ‘basal corvid’ lineages are actually ‘basal passerine’ lineages, and there is a discrepancy between nuclear Rag- 1 phylogenies (the most commonly used gene in passerine phylogenetics) and other phylogenies, including mitochondrial, that requires further investigation. Taken as a whole, this thesis adds significantly to our understanding of the evolution of birds, and provides a foundation for future research, not only of phylogenetic relationships, but also of avian life history, long-term niche stability and macroevolution...|$|E
40|$|Mori dream {{spaces are}} {{algebraic}} varieties with finitely generated Cox ring; basic examples are toric varieties or rational varieties with a torus action of complexity one. Due to the finite {{generation of the}} Cox ring, Mori dream spaces allow an explicit approach in terms of commutative algebra and polyhedral combinatorics. Based on this approach we develop a series of algorithms to explore the geometry of Mori dream spaces. We first present a toolkit for basic computations with Mori dream spaces, e. g., determining the Picard group, cones of divisor classes, the canonical toric ambient variety, singularities or a test for being factorial. Specialized algorithms are presented for the case of complete intersection Cox rings or varieties with a torus action of complexity one, e. g., the computation of intersection numbers, the test for the Fano or Gorenstein properties, roots of the automorphism <b>group,</b> <b>resolution</b> of singularities. We apply these algorithms to explore and classify certain (combinatorially) minimal singular del Pezzo k*-surfaces of Picard rank two. As a first advanced algorithm, we show how to compute the Mori chamber decomposition and the GIT-fan of a torus action on an affine variety. A second series of advanced algorithms concerns {{the problem of the}} behavior of the Cox ring under modifications, e. g., of blow ups. We develop algorithms to verify finite generation, verify a guess of generators, systematically produce generators and to determine the ideal of relations of the Cox ring of the modified variety. This includes an algorithm to compute Cox rings of blow ups of Mori dream spaces that terminates if and only if the new variety is a Mori dream space. As applications, we determine the Cox rings of certain blow ups of the three-dimensional projective space and of the Gorenstein log-terminal del Pezzo surfaces of Picard number one without a non-trival k*-action. As further application, we determine the Cox rings of the smooth rational surfaces of Picard number at most six; for Picard number six, we restrict ourselves to the cases without a non-trival k*-action whereas the classification is complete for Picard number up to five. Mori-Dream-Spaces sind algebraische Varietäten mit endlich erzeugtem Coxring, etwa torische Varietäten oder rationale Varietäten mit einer Toruswirkung der Komplexität eins. Aufgrund des endlichen Erzeugendensystems für den Coxring können Mori-Dream-Spaces durch Methoden der kommutativen Algebra und polyedrischen Kombinatorik behandelt werden. Aufbauend auf dieser Beschreibung entwickeln wir eine Reihe an Algorithmen zur Untersuchung der Geometrie von Mori-Dream-Spaces. Zunächst präsentieren wir Werkzeuge, um grundlegende Berechnungen mit Mori-Dream-Spaces durchführen zu können, z. B. das Bestimmen der Picardgruppe, Kegel von Divisorenklassen, kanonische torische ambiente Varietät, Singularitäten oder der Test auf Faktorialität. Spezialisierte Algorithmen werden für Varietäten, deren Coxring ein vollständigen Durchschnitt ist, oder für Varietäten mit einer Toruswirkung der Komplexität eins vorgestellt, etwa das Berechnen von Schnittzahlen, das Testen auf die Fano- oder Gorenstein-Eigenschaft, das Berechnen von Wurzeln der Automorphismengruppe oder das Auflösen von Singularitäten. Als Anwendung unserer Algorithmen untersuchen und klassifizieren wir gewisse (kombinatorisch) minimale del-Pezzo k*-Flächen mit Picardzahl zwei. Als ersten fortgeschrittenen Algorithmus zeigen wir, wie man die Mori-Kammerzerlegung eines Mori-Dream-Spaces und den GIT-Fächer von Toruswirkungen auf affinen Varietäten berechnet. Eine zweite Reihe an fortgeschritten Algorithmen beschäftigt sich mit der Auswirkung von Modifikationen, etwa von Aufblasungen, auf Coxringe. Wir entwickeln Algorithmen, um zu verifizieren, dass der Coxring der modifizierten Varietät endlich erzeugt ist, um geratene Erzeuger zu verifizieren, um systematisch Erzeuger zu produzieren und um Relationen zu berechnen. Dies beinhaltet einen Algorithmus zur Berechnung von Coxringen von Aufblasungen eines Mori-Dream-Spaces, der genau dann terminiert, wenn der Coxring der Aufblasung endlich erzeugt ist.

40|$|Mechanisms for the {{generation}} of biodiversity in species-rich biomes such as rain forests remain unclear. Molecular phylogenies using DNA sequence data, calibrated with a temporal dimension offer a means of addressing this question, enabling the testing of different hypotheses on biogeographic histories and causes of diversification. Manilkara is a genus of trees in the Sapotaceae consisting of 79 species distributed throughout the tropics (30 South and Central American, 35 African and 14 Southeast Asian). This species diversity in all major tropical regions of the globe makes it an ideal candidate for in-depth biogeographic studies. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses of nuclear (ITS) and chloroplast (rpl 32 -trnL, rps 16 -trnK and trnS-trnFM) sequences were used to reconstruct a species level phylogeny of Manilkara and related genera in the tribe Mimusopeae. Manilkara, as currently defined, is not monophyletic due to the placement of three Asian taxa (M. fasciculata, M. dissecta and M. udoido), which are {{more closely related to}} the Madagascan genera Labourdonnaisia and Faucherea than to Manilkara s. s. and need to be re-circumscribed in a new genus. Letestua is nested in Manilkara and the genera Faucherea and Labourdonnaisia are not monophyletic. Nuclear and chloroplast datasets were mostly congruent, however, three instances of hard incongruence were demonstrated, suggesting chloroplast capture events. Bayesian analyses of ITS sequences using a relaxed molecular clock calibrated with fossils, focused on testing biogeographical hypotheses on the origin of Manilkara’s pantropical disjunct distribution and spatio-temporal diversification patterns on each continent. Mimusopeae, originated during the Eocene 46 - 57 Ma and fossil evidence supports its existence in the boreotopical region of the northern hemisphere during this time. This suggests that the tribe may have evolved there and found refuge in Africa when Oligocene climatic cooling made higher latitudes uninhabitable for megathermal taxa. The subtribe Manilkarinae was resolved as 42 - 36 Myo. These ages fall on the Eocene-Oligocene boundary and the crown node age coincides with the onset of Oligocene cooling and the closing of the boreotropical route. The genus Manilkara is estimated to have evolved 36 - 33 Ma. The current distribution of the genus could not, therefore, have been the result of Gondwanan vicariance or migration through the boreotropics, but results instead support long distance dispersal as an important factor influencing the distribution of the <b>group.</b> <b>Resolution</b> along the backbone of the phylogeny is weak and the area of origin is, therefore, difficult to determine. However, all sister taxa to Manilkara are African and this suggests that the most likely explanation is an African origin for the genus with subsequent inter-continental dispersal during the Miocene. Manilkara spread from Africa to the Neotropics and Asia via at least three separate long distance dispersal events. A single lineage dispersed to the Neotropics 27 - 21 Ma and spread across the Isthmus of Panama before its closure. Another lineage dispersed to Southeast Asia 30 - 25 Ma from mainland Africa and subsequently diversified throughout the region. A third dispersal from Madagascar to the Sahul Shelf, occurred 31 - 16 Ma in the M. fasciculata/dissecta/udoido lineage. In South America, diversification is consistent with both aridification and the rearrangement of drainage patterns in the Amazon basin as a result of Andean orogeny. The Atlantic coastal forest clade and the Amazonian clade of Manilkara split from one another 14 Ma, at approximately {{the same time as the}} dry biomes of the Cerrado and Caatinga were forming between them. In Africa diversification coincides with Tertiary cycles of aridification and uplift of the east African plateaux. In Southeast Asia Wallace’s Line did not affect the dispersal of Manilkara. Instead, the limiting factor was the appearance of land in New Guinea 10 Ma, which coincides with the dispersal and establishment of new taxa east of Wallace’s Line. Spatio-temporal patterns of diversification in Manilkara were compared to those of 34 other wet tropical genera which have intercontinental disjunctions. Ages of disjunctions ranged from the Eocene to the Pliocene, indicating that compilation of the tropical rain forest biome is a dynamic process which has been occurring throughout the Tertiary.

40|$|Public {{trust is}} {{critical}} in any project requiring significant public support, both in monetary terms and to encourage participation. The research community has widely recognized the centrality of public trust, garnered through community consultation, {{to the success of}} large-scale epidemiology. This paper examines the potential utility of the deliberative democracy methodology within the public health research setting. A deliberative democracy event was undertaken in Tasmania, Australia, as part of a wider program of community consultation regarding the potential development of a Tasmanian Biobank. Twenty-five Tasmanians of diverse backgrounds participated in two weekends of deliberation; involving elements of information gathering; discussion; identification of issues and formation of <b>group</b> <b>resolutions.</b> Participants demonstrated strong support for a Tasmanian Biobank and their deliberations resulted in specific proposals in relation to consent; privacy; return of results; governance; funding; and, commercialization and benefit sharing. They exhibited a high degree of satisfaction with the event, and confidence in the outcomes. Deliberative democracy methodology is a useful tool for community engagement that addresses some of the limitations of traditional consultation methods...|$|R
40|$|Project Objectives: Evaluate {{the extent}} and spatial pattern of forest {{fragmentation}} in western Washington {{and its implications for}} timber management, wildlife and fire fighting. Justification: a. Linkage to DM Surveys and FIA P 2 and P 3 plot data: FIA monitoring in Washington has detected very rapid conversion of forest land to nonforest land uses in Washington in the last decade, with 5 % of private timberland (270, 000 acres) being converted between 1990 - 2000, and a similar rate of loss in the previous decade (Gray et al. 2005). However, we have little information on the spatial pattern and extent of fragmentation on these lands. Forest area and fragmentation is one of the six leading indicators of US forest health adopted in the FHM Focus <b>Group</b> <b>Resolutions,</b> July 2007. b. Significance in terms of the geographic scale: The FIA plot sample does indicate, however, that this conversion is not simply limited to the Seattle area. Development has also been occurring along the entire I- 5 corridor, on the Olympic Penninsula, and in southwest Washington near Portland. Indeed, Oregon’s land-use laws may b...|$|R
