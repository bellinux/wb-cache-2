30|$|Ethylene–vinyl acetate {{copolymers}} (EVA) are widespread materials, with hot-melt adhesives {{and plastic}} wraps being common applications [54]. Although free-radical copolymerizations usually produce gradient or block polymers, perfectly random copolymers are {{obtained from the}} polymerization of ethylene <b>and</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> due to similar reactivities [55]. However, undesired and random branching is inherently promoted via a back-biting process, significantly altering the characteristics and performance of the copolymers. However, perfectly linear ethylene–vinyl acetate copolymers can be prepared by means of ADMET polymerization [56]. A number of monomers with various methylene run lengths ranging from 8 to 12 were subjected to polymerization and subsequent hydrogenation, furnishing copolymers with different <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> contents (acetate branches separated by 18 – 26 carbons). Commercial samples with similar <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> ratios were compared with the ADMET copolymers.

40|$|A {{synthetic}} {{platform for}} the preparation of various norbornenyl (Nb) containing reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agents has been developed. The design of the chain transfer agents (CTAs) {{is based on the}} desymmetrization of alpha,alpha'-dibromo-p-xylene by monosubstitution with an alkoxide anion and subsequent replacement of the residual bromine atom in the benzylic bromide to create several series of RAFT CTA including trithiocarbonate, xanthate and dithiobenzoate CTAs, allowing for the possibility to introduce other functional groups besides Nb, such as an allyl group. While a norbomene functionality was chosen as most reactive functional group toward thiols in radical-mediated thiol-ene chemistry, an ally] group was introduced for the sake of direct comparison of the double bond reactivity in the thiol-ene reaction. Control of the radical polymerization of acrylates, styrene <b>and</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> has been achieved by using this novel family of CTAs. The results indicate that the Nb group remained intact at low monomer conversions (e. g., below 50 % for styrene <b>and</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> below 30 % for acrylates) and at optimal reaction temperatures (e. g., 70 degrees C for styrene <b>and</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> 62 <b>and</b> 65 degrees C for 1 -ethoxyethyl acrylate and methyl acrylate, respectively), while the monomer-to-CTA ratio was kept high. Polymers with high end-group fidelity were modified with a series of thiol-containing compounds, leading to alpha-semitelechelics with different chain-end structures. While allyl-containing polymers exhibited a significantly lower reactivity, modification of the Nb-containing semitelechelics was rapid and fully accomplished under the same reaction conditions.
