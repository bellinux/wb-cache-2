25|$|Using this definition, ω + 3 {{can be seen}} to be a {{successor}} ordinal (it is the successor of ω + 2), whereas 3 + ω <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> ordinal, namely, the limit of 3 + 0 = 3, 3 + 1 = 4, 3 + 2 = 5, etc., which is just ω.|$|E

25|$|Brownian {{motion is}} among the {{simplest}} of the continuous-time stochastic (or probabilistic) processes, and it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> of both simpler and more complicated stochastic processes (see random walk and Donsker's theorem). This universality {{is closely related to}} the universality of the normal distribution. In both cases, it is often mathematical convenience, rather than the accuracy of the models, that motivates their use.|$|E
25|$|The oxide {{forms on}} the surface of the tantalum, but it also grows into the material. For each unit {{thickness}} of oxide growth, one third grows out and two thirds grows in.

25|$|S visas are nonimmigrant visas {{issued to}} {{individuals}} who have assisted law enforcement as a witness or informant. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> of 200 S visas a year.

25|$|Experimental {{research}} for treatment has been mostly focused on facial synkinesis {{due to its}} abundant prevalence compared to extra-ocular synkinesis. Additionally, since the extra-ocular muscles are hidden within the orbits, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> {{on the type of}} practical treatments that can be established (e.g. massage). Treatments for synkinesis in general include facial retraining, biofeedback, mime therapy, and Botox and surgery, as a last resort.|$|E
25|$|Gorban–Yablonsky theorem. A {{system of}} {{reactions}} with some irreversible reactions <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> of systems with detailed balance when some constants {{tend to zero}} {{if and only if}} (i) the reversible part of this system satisfies the principle of detailed balance and (ii) the convex hull of the stoichiometric vectors of the irreversible reactions has empty intersection with the linear span of the stoichiometric vectors of the reversible reactions. Physically, the last condition means that the irreversible reactions cannot be included in oriented cyclic pathways.|$|E

25|$|The {{variability}} of production {{from a single}} wind turbine can be high. Combining any additional number of turbines (for example, in a wind farm) results in lower statistical variation, {{as long as the}} correlation between the output of each turbine is imperfect, and the correlations are always imperfect due to the distance between each turbine. Similarly, geographically distant wind turbines or wind farms have lower correlations, reducing overall variability. Since wind power is dependent on weather systems, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> to the benefit of this geographic diversity for any power system.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theory that}} is being {{examined}} to explain age related declines in working memory is that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> in attentional resources seen as we age. This means that older individuals are less capable of dividing their attention between two tasks, and thus tasks with higher attentional demands {{are more difficult to}} complete due to a reduction in mental energy. Tasks that are simple and more automatic, however, see fewer declines as we age. Working memory tasks often involve divided attention, thus {{they are more likely to}} strain the limited resources of aging individuals.|$|E
25|$|In microeconomics, the Bertrand–Edgeworth {{model of}} price-setting {{oligopoly}} looks at {{what happens when}} there is a homogeneous product (i.e. consumers want to buy from the cheapest seller) where there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> to the output of firms which they are willing and able to sell at a particular price. This differs from the Bertrand competition model where it is assumed that firms are willing and able to meet all demand. The limit to output can be considered as a physical capacity constraint which is the same at all prices (as in Edgeworth’s work), or to vary with price under other assumptions.|$|E

There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> of 40 horse power motors on Kingsmere. The Waskesiu Marina, Heart Lakes Marina and the Narrows have boat launches (permit and fee required) and docks. Boat, canoe and kayak rentals {{are available at}} all three, by the hour or by the day. The Waskesiu Marina has a concrete breakwater. A permit is required to use boat launch facilities. Personal watercraft are not allowed on any lakes. Canoes, kayaks and sail boats are allowed on all waters.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{the company}} {{provides}} a monthly flat-fee for DVD and Blu-ray rentals. A subscriber creates a rental queue, a list, of films to rent. The films are delivered individually via the United States Postal Service from regional warehouses. As of March 28, 2011, Netflix had 58 shipping locations throughout the United States The subscriber {{can keep the}} rented disc as long as desired, but there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> {{on the number of}} discs that each subscriber can have simultaneously via different tiers. To rent a new disc, the subscriber must return the previous disc in a metered reply mail envelope. Upon receipt, Netflix ships the next available disc in the subscriber's rental queue.|$|E
25|$|So {{the rank}} r {{is the largest}} integer k for which F'k is not identically zero on E. In this case, as a non-vanishing polynomial, F'r is non-zero on an open dense subset of E. the regular {{elements}}. Any other a <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> of regular elements a(n). Since the operator norm of L(x) gives an equivalent norm on E, a standard compactness argument shows that, passing to a subsequence if necessary, the spectral idempotents of the a(n) and their corresponding eigenvalues are convergent. The limit of Jordan frames is a Jordan frame, since a limit of non-zero idempotents yields a non-zero idempotent by continuity of the operator norm. It follows that every Jordan frame {{is made up of}} r minimal idempotents.|$|E
