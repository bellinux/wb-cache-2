25|$|Forage fish also inhabit {{freshwater}} habitats, such as {{lakes and}} rivers, where {{they serve as}} food for larger freshwater predators. Usually smaller than 15 centimetres (6in) in length, these small bait fish make {{up most of the}} fish found in lakes and rivers. The minnow family alone, consisting of minnows, chubs, shiners and daces, consists of more than fifty species. Other freshwater forage fish include suckers, killifish, shad, bony fish as well as fish of the sunfish family, excluding black basses and crappie, and smaller species of the carp family. There are also anadromous forage fish, such as <b>eulachon.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{bald eagle}} is an {{opportunistic}} carnivore {{with the capacity}} to consume {{a great variety of}} prey. Throughout their range, fish often comprise the majority of the eagle's diet. In 20 food habit studies across the species' range, fish comprised 56% of the diet of nesting eagles, birds 28%, mammals 14% and other prey 2%. In Southeast Alaska, fish comprise approximately 66% of the year-around diet of bald eagles and 78% of the prey brought to the nest by the parents. Eagles living in the Columbia River Estuary in Oregon were found to rely on fish for 90% of their dietary intake. In the Pacific Northwest, spawning trout and salmon provide most of the bald eagles' diet from late summer throughout fall. Southeast Alaskan eagles largely prey on pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), coho salmon (O. kisutch) and, more locally, sockeye salmon (O. nerka), with chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), due to their large size ( [...] average adult size) probably being taken only as carrion. Also important in the estuaries and shallow coastlines of southern Alaska are Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) and <b>eulachon</b> (Thaleichthys pacificus). In Oregon's Columbia River Estuary, the most significant prey species were largescale suckers (Catostomus macrocheilus) (17.3% of the prey selected there), American shad (Alosa sapidissima; 13%) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio; 10.8%). Eagles living in the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland were found to subsist largely on American gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), threadfin shad (D. petenense) and white bass (Morone chrysops). Floridian eagles have been reported to prey on catfish, most prevalently the brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) and any species in the Ictalurus genus as well as mullet, trout, needlefish, and eels. Wintering eagles on the Platte River in Nebraska preyed mainly on American gizzard shads and common carp. From observation in the Columbia River, 58% of the fish were caught live by the eagle, 24% were scavenged as carcasses and 18% were pirated away from other animals.|$|E
5000|$|The Dakelh {{engaged in}} {{extensive}} {{trade with the}} coast along trails known as [...] "Grease Trails". The items exported consisted primarily of hides, dried meat, and mats of dried berries. Imports consisted of various marine products, {{the most important of}} which was [...] "grease", the oil extracted from <b>eulachons</b> (also known as [...] "candlefish") by allowing them to rot, adding boiling water, and skimming off the oil. This oil is extremely nutritious and, unlike many other fats, contains desirable fatty acids. Other important imports were smoked <b>eulachons</b> and dried red laver seaweed. [...] "Grease" [...] and smoked <b>eulachons</b> are still {{considered by many to be}} delicacies and are prized gifts from visitors from the west. The route by which Sir Alexander MacKenzie and his party reached the Pacific Ocean in 1793 in the first crossing of North America by land was, from the Fraser River westward, a grease trail. Other examples include the Cheslatta Trail and the Nyan Wheti.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{traces of}} people living in the Fraser Valley date from 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. The Stó:lō called this area, their {{traditional}} territory, S'ólh Téméxw. The early inhabitants of the area were highly mobile hunter-gatherers. There is archeological evidence of a settlement in the lower Fraser Canyon (called [...] "the Milliken site") and a seasonal encampment ("the Glenrose Cannery site") near the mouth of the Fraser River. Remains of this latter campsite show that in spring and early summer, the people came here to hunt land and sea mammals, such as deer, elk, and seals and, to a lesser extent, to fish for salmon, stickleback, <b>eulachon,</b> and sturgeon and to gather shellfish. Their lives depended on their success at harvesting the resources of the land and the rivers through fishing, foraging, and hunting.|$|E

5000|$|Indigenous {{communities}} of the Pacific Coast from California to Alaska made <b>eulachon</b> {{an important part of}} their diet, as well as a valuable trade item with peoples whose territories did not include spawning rivers. The species was caught using traps, rakes, and nets. The harvest continues today, with other residents taking part in the exploitation of the large runs. Today harvested <b>eulachon</b> are typically stored frozen and thawed as needed. They may also be dried, smoked, or canned. <b>Eulachon</b> were also processed for their rich oil. The usual process was to allow the fish to decompose for a week or more in a pit in the ground, then add boiling water and skim off the oil, which would rise to the surface. <b>Eulachon</b> oil (also known as [...] "grease") was the most important product traded into the interior; as a result, the trails over which the trade was conducted {{came to be known as}} grease trails. Other uses of <b>eulachon</b> by non-Natives include bait for sportfishing and food for cats and dogs.|$|E

50|$|<b>Eulachon,</b> as {{anadromous}} fish, {{spend most}} of their adult lives in the ocean but return to their natal freshwater streams and rivers to spawn and die. As such, one stream may see regular large runs of <b>eulachon</b> while a neighboring stream sees few or none at all. Regular annual runs are common but not entirely predictable, and occasionally a river which has large runs sees a year with no returns; the reasons for such variability are not known. The <b>eulachon</b> run is characteristic for the early portion being almost entirely male, with females following about midway through the run to its conclusion. Males are easily distinguished from females during spawning by fleshy ridges which form along the length of their bodies.|$|E

5000|$|Originally, the Chilkat {{group of}} Tlingit {{controlled}} the trail, which they used for {{trade with the}} Athabascan people of the interior. They called the trail [...] "grease trail" [...] after the <b>eulachon</b> oil (extracted from the tiny candlefish) {{that was the most}} important item of trade on the Chilkoot side. Each Tlingit chief had an exclusive Athabascan trading partner. Tlingits took <b>eulachon</b> oil and returned with furs, hides and copper nuggets gathered by the Athabascans. Trading parties often lasted a month or more and often consisted of as many as 100 men, each of whom would carry a 45 kg (100 pound) load.|$|E
5000|$|On November 2008, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) {{received}} a petition from the Cowlitz Tribe to list a distinct population segment (DPS) of <b>eulachon</b> from Washington, Oregon, and California, (the so-called Southern DPS) as an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. (ESA). NMFS {{found that this}} petition presented enough information to warrant conducting a status review of the species.

5000|$|... "Grease Trail", Carrier /tl'inaɣeti/.

Indeed, the Carrier word /tl'inaɣe/ [...] "eulachon oil" [...] is a compound of Carrier /xe/ [...] "grease, oil" [...] (combining form /ɣe/) with /tl'ina/, a loan from Heiltsuk or Haisla, North Wakashan languages spoken on the coast.|$|E
5000|$|Trails were {{developed}} for trade between indigenous people, particularly {{the trade in}} <b>eulachon</b> oil (also spelled oolichan oil). The grease from these small fish could be traded for furs, copper, and obsidian, among other things.

50|$|Twenty-one {{species of}} fish have been {{documented}} in fresh waters in the park.

5000|$|The {{common names}} of this fish have a {{somewhat}} confusing relationship. The name [...] "candlefish" [...] derives from it being so fat during spawning, {{with up to}} 15% of total body weight in fat, that if caught, dried, and strung on a wick, it can be burned as a candle. This is the name most often used by early explorers. The name <b>eulachon</b> (occasionally seen as oolichan, oulachon, and uthlecan) is from the Chinookan language and the Chinook Jargon based on that language. There is a theory that the term [...] "hooligan" [...] was influenced by [...] "eulachon", rather than simply taken from the Irish surname.|$|E
