60|$|I Have {{received}} a letter from a gentleman who is very indignant at what he considers my flippancy in disregarding or degrading Spiritualism. I thought I was defending Spiritualism; but I am rather used to being accused of mocking the thing that I set out to justify. My fate in most controversies is rather pathetic. It is an almost invariable rule that the man with whom I don't agree thinks I am making a fool of myself, and the man with whom I do agree thinks I am making a fool of him. There seems {{to be some sort of}} idea that you are not treating a subject properly if you eulogise it with fantastic terms or defend it by grotesque examples. Yet a truth is equally solemn whatever figure or example its exponent adopts. It is an equally awful truth that four and four make eight, whether you reckon the thing out in <b>eight</b> onions <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> angels, <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> bricks <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> bishops, <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> minor poets <b>or</b> <b>eight</b> pigs. Similarly, if it be true that God made all things, that grave fact can be asserted by pointing at a star or by waving an umbrella. But the case is stronger than this. There is a distinct philosophical advantage in using grotesque terms in a serious discussion.|$|R

5|$|The {{parathyroid}} glands are {{variable in}} number: {{three or more}} small glands, and can usually be located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. Occasionally, some individuals may have six, <b>eight,</b> <b>or</b> even more parathyroid glands. Rarely, the parathyroid glands may be within the thyroid gland itself, the chest, or even the thymus.|$|E
5|$|Each troop {{is divided}} into patrols of <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> so Scouts led by a patrol leader elected from within the patrol. Patrol {{meetings}} are generally held during the weekly troop meeting. The patrol's independence from the troop varies among troops and between activities. Patrols' autonomy becomes more visible at campouts, where each patrol may set up its own camping and cooking area. Divisions between patrols may disappear during an event which {{only a small part}} of the troop attends. Patrols may hold meetings and even excursions separately from the rest of the troop.|$|E
5|$|Growing up in Malibu, California, {{she began}} {{learning}} the violin {{at the age}} of four and left regular school five years later with the goal of becoming a world-class violinist; she practiced <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> nine hours a day and read a wide range of literature. Progressing to writing her own music, she studied under various teachers and went to Indiana University, which she left over issues regarding the relationship between classical music and the appearance of the performer. Through her own independent label Traitor Records, Autumn debuted with her classical album , followed by the release in 2003 of her album Enchant.|$|E

5|$|In mammals, sexual {{differentiation}} {{is determined}} by the sperm that carries either an X or a Y (male) chromosome. The Y chromosome contains a sex-determining gene (SRY) that encodes a transcription factor for the protein tdf (testis determining factor) and triggers the creation of testosterone and Anti-Müllerian hormone for the embryo's development into a male. This differentiation begins about <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> nine weeks after conception. Some sources state that it continues until the twelfth week, while others state that it is clearly evident by the thirteenth week and that the sex organs are fully developed by the sixteenth week.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile magpies begin {{foraging}} {{on their}} own three weeks after leaving the nest, and mostly feeding themselves by six months old. Some birds continue begging for food until <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> nine months of age, but are usually ignored. Birds reach adult size by their first year. The age at which young birds disperse varies across the country, and depends on the aggressiveness of the dominant adult of the corresponding sex; males are usually evicted at a younger age. Many leave at around a year old, but the age of departure may range from eight months to four years.|$|E
5|$|Menkauhor ruled for {{possibly}} <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> nine years, following king Nyuserre Ini, and was {{succeeded in}} turn by Djedkare Isesi. Although Menkauhor is well attested by historical sources, few artifacts from his reign have survived. Consequently, his familial relation to his predecessor and successor is unclear, and no offspring of his have been identified. Khentkaus III {{may have been}} Menkauhor's mother, as indicated by evidence discovered in her tomb in 2015.|$|E

It was a large building, with an area of about , and incorporated a substantial area dedicated to commercial activities including <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> nine shops opening onto the road and a large olive-pressing complex.|$|E
5|$|The Iraqi Army, led by Bakr Sidqi, an {{experienced}} brigadier general, an Iraqi nationalist and general of Kurdish origin, {{although not a}} Kurdish nationalist, moved north in order to crush the Assyrian revolt. The Iraqi forces started executing every Assyrian male found in the mountainous Bekher region between Zakho and Duhok starting from 8 August 1933. Assyrian civilians were transported in military trucks from Zakho and Dohuk to uninhabited places, in batches of <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> ten, where they were shot with machine guns and run over by heavy armoured cars {{to make sure no}} one survived.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} {{revealed that}} {{the location of the}} stones was not their original prehistoric position. The original location of the circle was identified as existing a few feet to the west, under the adjacent hedge. The original circle had either <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> possibly nine sockets for stones and was oval shaped. The perimeter of the ring was defined by V-shaped ditches on its eastern and western perimeters. The maximum axis of the circle would have been approximately 20 feet (6.5 metres), making it considerably smaller than the size proposed by the Piggotts.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} stone circles {{were built in}} the area around modern Dorset, {{typically}} being constructed from sarsen stone and being smaller than those found elsewhere. The Hampton Down ring was erected on an open downland ridge overlooking the coast. It originally contained either <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> nine sarsen stones and had a diameter of 20 feet (6.5 metres) across with a track leading to it from the north. By 1908 the circle had been shifted east of its original position, with a hedge built across the site, and the number of stones increased to sixteen. By 1964 the number of stones had further increased to twenty-eight. In 1965, Geoffrey J. Wainwright oversaw an archaeological excavation which revealed the circle's original location and dimensions, after which it was reconstructed in its original location with the extraneous stones removed.|$|E
5|$|All serpins share {{a common}} {{structure}} (or fold), despite their varied functions. All typically have three β-sheets (named A, B and C) and <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> nine α-helices (named hA–hI). The most significant regions to serpin function are the A-sheet and the reactive centre loop (RCL). The A-sheet includes two β-strands that are in a parallel orientation with a region between them called the 'shutter', and upper region called the 'breach'. The RCL forms the initial interaction with the target protease in inhibitory molecules. Structures have been solved showing the RCL either fully exposed or partially inserted into the A-sheet, and serpins {{are thought to be}} in dynamic equilibrium between these two states. The RCL also only makes temporary interactions {{with the rest of the}} structure, and is therefore highly flexible and exposed to the solvent.|$|E
5|$|Another {{game from}} the book is Civil War, a text-based {{computer}} game that puts the player against the computer in a simulation of the American Civil War. Civil War originated on multi-user mainframe computers in 1968, and simulates fourteen major battles of the conflict, with the human player as the South and the computer as the North. The player can control four direct variables which interact to determine a battle's outcome: how much of their {{money to spend on}} food, salaries, and ammunition, and which of four offensive or four defensive strategies to use. The side with the fewest casualties wins a battle, and if the player wins <b>eight</b> <b>or</b> more battles they win the game. After appearing in 101 BASIC Computer Games, Civil War was later {{one of a number of}} text-based games available on early 1980s pay-to-play systems.|$|E
