500|$|Savides' first {{experience}} with the Viper Filmstream camera was shooting a Motorola commercial with Fincher. From there, he used it on Zodiac. Fincher {{wanted to make sure}} that the camera was more inclined towards film production so that the studio would be more comfortable about using it on a project with a large budget. To familiarize himself with the camera, he [...] "did as many things 'wrong' as <b>I</b> <b>possibly</b> could. I went against everything I was supposed to do with the camera." [...] Savides felt comfortable with the camera after discovering its limitations.|$|E

500|$|At 21 years old, the now-famous Hill {{was still}} living {{at home with her}} parents. She had been {{enrolled}} at Columbia University during this period, and considered majoring in history as she became a sophomore, but left after about a year of total studies once sales of The Score went into the millions. In 1996, Hill responded to a false rumor on The Howard Stern Show that she had made a racist comment on MTV, saying [...] "How can <b>I</b> <b>possibly</b> be a racist? My music is universal music. And I believe in God. If I believe in God, then I have to love all of God's creations. There can be no segregation." ...|$|E
500|$|Through Caldwell more {{officers}} {{joined the}} protest, including two other celebrated aces, Wing Commander Bobby Gibbes and Squadron Leader John Waddy, {{as well as}} Squadron Leader Bert Grace, Squadron Leader Douglas Vanderfield, and later, Squadron Leader Stuart Harpham. During {{a series of meetings}} early in April 1945, Caldwell proposed that the eight resign en masse, and the others agreed. Arthur later stated that, [...] "I meant to make as big a fuss as <b>I</b> <b>possibly</b> could with the object of getting the position corrected... All the same, we realised that, to lay ourselves open to any charge of mutiny, we might lessen the force of what we were doing, which was the reason we put the things in as resignations and not as any attempt to unseat people higher up." ...|$|E
500|$|Carter {{researched}} for {{the book}} during 2010. He had secured a publishing deal {{for the book}} by January of that year. Carter confirmed to Gillian Reagan of Business Insider that in his research, he tried to gather information from multiple viewpoints. He said, [...] "I'm reaching out to everyone <b>I</b> <b>possibly</b> can to get every side of the story." [...] Carter {{said that he was}} remaining neutral about the 2010 Tonight Show conflict. [...] "I obviously have to reach out to all sides", he said. [...] "For the longest time, I personally tried to watch as many episodes of all the shows as I could to get sense of each show, and what each guy does. I don't just pick one and stick with that guy." [...] Carter researched the impact of financial decision-making on the controversy. He said he had known Leno for a long time, and O'Brien since he began working for NBC, and that these connections gave him the benefit of familiarity.|$|E

500|$|In late February {{and early}} March 2007, the band headlined a North American {{with support from}} Underoath and Armor for Sleep. On April 2, [...] "My Blue Heaven" [...] was {{released}} as a single and released to radio a week later. From late July to early September, the band participated in the 2007 Projekt Revolution tour with Linkin Park. On August 3 {{it was announced that}} O'Connell had injured his back, and he was replaced by Matchbook Romance drummer Aaron Stern {{for the remainder of the}} tour. Shortly after the tour Mascherino left the band, although his departure was not announced until early October. He said, [...] "It was getting to the point where I felt I had taken the road as long as <b>I</b> <b>possibly</b> could," [...] and his compositions were [...] "more pop than anyone else [...] wanted to go." [...] Mascherino had written over 45 songs, most intended for Louder Now but turned down by the band. He began a solo project, the Color Fred.|$|E
500|$|However, Mascherino {{left the}} band {{following}} {{the end of}} the tour. He said, [...] "It was {{getting to the point where}} I felt I had taken the road as long as <b>I</b> <b>possibly</b> could," [...] and his compositions were [...] "more pop than anyone else [...] wanted to go". In October, the group revealed that their next album was [...] "in its very early stages". In December, Rubano said the group was in New York City working on new material, having already written six songs. Prior to demoing, O'Connell had to have back surgery, having injured it during the Projekt Revolution tour. During the demoing process, the group tried different drummers, but according to Rubano: [...] "They just weren't Mark. Not enough ferocity, intensity." [...] Following this, the band's members took time to refocus themselves after several years of constant touring. Lazzara sorted his life out following addiction issues, ending his engagement to Chauntelle DuPree of Eisley. He subsequently moved to another town, got married, and had a child. O'Connell also got married, Reyes spent time with his family, and Rubano recorded music for the TV show Electric Company.|$|E
500|$|In April 1945, having {{recently}} assumed {{command of}} No.1 TAF's No.78 Wing, Arthur helped trigger {{an incident that}} {{became known as the}} [...] "Morotai Mutiny" [...] (a phrase originating in one of his aide memoires at the time). He was one of eight senior pilots, including Australia's top-scoring ace, Group Captain Clive Caldwell, and fellow veterans from the North African campaign, Bobby Gibbes and John Waddy, who attempted to resign their commissions in protest at the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground attack missions. Frustrated at the lack of attention paid by Headquarters No.1 TAF to a [...] "balance sheet" [...] he produced showing that operational losses outweighed results, Arthur later said that his object for the [...] "mutiny" [...] was to [...] "make as big a fuss as <b>I</b> <b>possibly</b> could with the object of getting the position corrected." [...] A government inquiry into the incident exonerated the pilots, finding their motives in tendering their resignations to be sincere. Arthur remained in charge of No.78 Wing for the Battle of Tarakan, which commenced on 1May. He handed over command of the wing on 24May, but remained on Tarakan {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

500|$|Although What You Were Hoping For? was {{acclaimed}} by critics, {{it received}} some backlash from Hunt's fanbase and listeners, who were ambivalent about its stylistic departure from his previous work. He addressed the criticism {{in an interview}} for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: [...] "Other recording artists will supply their fans with an album full of songs they will enjoy for 15 or 20 years. I'm a man that grows, progresses and matures, I want to grow [...] {{with the people who}} want to go with me on that journey ... An artist should put out work that the culture should inspire to as opposed to trying to meet the culture, that's backwards to me. I don't just sit down and worry about what people will like, my job is to express myself as honest as <b>I</b> <b>possibly</b> can." [...] What You Were Hoping For? peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Albums, which is a weekly music chart that ranks top-selling albums by new or developing acts, defined as those who have never appeared in the top 100 of the Billboard 200 or in the top 10 of Billboards component charts. The album also reached number 50 on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{received}} his degree in 1973 and was ordained a deacon in June 1973 at the cathedral {{of the diocese}} of Newark, New Jersey. [...] He served as curate at Christ Church in Ridgewood, New Jersey, and was ordained a priest six months later. He and his wife remained at the Ridgewood parish for two years until June 1975. They then moved to New Hampshire, where Boo had grown up. Their goal was {{to start a business}} and ministry: in the winter it was called [...] "The Sign of the Dove Retreat Center" [...] and in the summer it became [...] "Pony Farm". [...] Boo still runs [...] "Pony Farm" [...] as a horse camp for children. In 1977, Robinson began working with a committee in the Diocese of New Hampshire to study human sexuality and co-authored a small manual on the subject. Robinson and Boo's first daughter, Jamee, was born in 1977, followed by a second daughter, Ella, in 1981. Robinson treasures his marriage stating, [...] "hat is inextricably tied up with having children. And since I cannot imagine my life without Jamee and Ella, it's just a completely irrelevant question for me. And I don't regret having been married to Boo, either, even if there had not been children. It's just a part of my journey, and why would <b>I</b> <b>possibly</b> regret that?" ...|$|E
