5|$|In 1975, {{the death}} of Franco marked the {{beginning}} of Spain's transition into a democracy and four years later, Josep Lluís Núñez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona. Since then, the members of Barcelona, called socios, <b>have</b> <b>elected</b> a club president.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez {{became the}} first elected {{president}} of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona <b>have</b> <b>elected</b> the club president. The process of electing a president of Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 {{and the end of}} Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability {{both on and off the}} pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such world-class players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.|$|E
50|$|In {{the eight}} full council {{elections}} since 1983, {{half the time}} Onslow ward <b>has</b> <b>elected</b> 3 Liberal Democrat councillors (or their predecessors SDP-Liberal Alliance councillors) {{and half of the}} time it <b>has</b> <b>elected</b> 1 Conservative councillor plus 2 Liberal Democrats (or SDP-Liberal Alliance) councillors.|$|R

5|$|India is a {{federation}} {{composed of}} 29 states and 7 union territories. All states, {{as well as}} the union territories of Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, <b>have</b> <b>elected</b> legislatures and governments, both patterned on the Westminster model. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the centre through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis. Since then, their structure has remained largely unchanged. Each state or union territory is further divided into administrative districts. The districts in turn are further divided into tehsils and ultimately into villages.|$|E
5|$|The All-Star Game {{managers}} {{selected the}} entire lineups from 1933 to 1946. In 1947, the fans {{were given the}} ability to select the starting lineups. This continued until 1957, when Cincinnati Reds fans stuffed the ballot box and selected seven Reds and Stan Musial. This forced Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick {{to step in and}} replace Wally Post and Gus Bell with Willie Mays and Hank Aaron that season and to turn over the starting lineup selection to players, coaches and managers for several subsequent seasons. Since 1970, the fans <b>have</b> <b>elected</b> the starting lineup of one player for each baseball position (except the pitcher) for both the National League and American League teams.|$|E
5|$|Mobile's city {{commission}} form {{of government}} was challenged and finally overturned in 1982 in City of Mobile v. Bolden, which was remanded by the United States Supreme Court to the district court. Finding that the city had adopted a commission {{form of government}} in 1911 and at-large positions with discriminatory intent, the court proposed that the {{three members of the}} city commission should be elected from single-member districts, likely ending their division of executive functions among them. Mobile's state legislative delegation in 1985 finally enacted a mayor-council form of government, with seven members elected from single-member districts. This was approved by voters. As white conservatives increasingly entered the Republican Party in the late 20th century, African-American residents of the city <b>have</b> <b>elected</b> members of the Democratic Party as their candidates of choice. Since the change to single-member districts, more women and African Americans were elected to the council than under the at-large system.|$|E

25|$|Both {{federal and}} provincial {{politics}} in the city tend {{to be dominated by}} the Liberal and New Democratic parties. Historically, the Liberals have been stronger in the Sudbury riding, with the New Democrats dominant in Nickel Belt, although both ridings <b>have</b> <b>elected</b> members of both parties at different times.|$|E
25|$|At a state level, Patagonia lies inside two {{countries}}: 10% in Chile and 90% in Argentina. Both {{countries have}} organised their Patagonian territories into non-equivalent administrative subdivisions: Provinces and departments in Argentina; and regions, provinces and communes in Chile. Being {{parts of a}} unitary state, Chile's first level administrative divisions—the regions—enjoy far less autonomy than Argentine provinces. Argentine provinces <b>have</b> <b>elected</b> governors and parliaments, while Chilean regions have government-appointed intendants.|$|E

25|$|South Shields {{is a safe}} Labour Party Parliamentary seat, {{the only}} {{constituency}} in existence since the Great Reform Act of 1832 never to <b>have</b> <b>elected</b> a Conservative MP. It is currently held by Emma Lewell-Buck who won the seat in a by-election held on 3 May 2013 which had been triggered by the retirement from politics of the previous incumbent David Miliband, who had served as Foreign Secretary {{in the government of}} Gordon Brown.|$|E
25|$|Virginia {{is unique}} in that all cities are {{independent}} jurisdictions and are completely separate from any county. Thus, most cities (with few exceptions such as Poquoson and Franklin) <b>have</b> <b>elected</b> sheriffs, most of which focus on court and jail operations. By law, sheriffs can enforce all {{the laws of the}} Commonwealth in the jurisdiction they serve. Some city sheriffs (such as Portsmouth and Newport News) also work alongside the city police in responding to calls and enforcing traffic violations.|$|E
25|$|Colorado is {{considered}} a swing state in both state and federal elections. Coloradans <b>have</b> <b>elected</b> 17 Democrats and 12 Republicans to the governorship in the last 100 years. In presidential politics, Colorado was considered a reliably Republican state during the post-World War II era, only voting for the Democratic candidate in 1948, 1964, and 1992. However, it became a competitive swing state {{by the turn of}} the century, and voted consecutively for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, as well as Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.|$|E
50|$|Parliamentary {{elections}} {{were held in}} Cuba on 24 February 1993 alongside elections to the fourteen Provincial Assemblies.

25|$|No {{definitive}} statement {{can be made}} {{concerning the}} credentials or experience levels of arbitrators, although some jurisdictions <b>have</b> <b>elected</b> to establish standards for arbitrators in certain fields. Several independent organizations, such as the American Arbitration Association and the National Arbitration Forum, offer arbitrator training programs and thus in effect, credentials. Generally speaking, however, the credibility of an arbitrator rests upon reputation, experience level in arbitrating particular issues, or expertise/experience in a particular field. Arbitrators are generally not required {{to be members of}} the legal profession.|$|E
25|$|Women {{have been}} elected to the House of Representatives from 45 of the 50 states in the United States. The states that have not elected a woman to the House are Alaska, Iowa, Mississippi, North Dakota, and Vermont—though Alaska, Iowa, and North Dakota <b>have</b> <b>elected</b> women to the United States Senate. Delaware was the most recent state to elect their first woman to the House (and to either chamber of Congress), electing Lisa Blunt Rochester in 2016. California has elected more women to Congress than any other state, with 41 representatives elected since 1923.|$|E
25|$|Oregonians {{have voted}} for the Democratic presidential {{candidate}} in every election since 1988. In 2004 and 2006, Democrats won {{control of the state}} Senate and then the House. Since the late 1990s, Oregon has been represented by four Democrats and one Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives. Since 2009, the state has had two Democratic U.S. senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley. Oregon voters <b>have</b> <b>elected</b> Democratic governors in every election since 1986, most recently electing Kate Brown over Republican Bud Pierce in a 2016 special election.|$|E

25|$|Staten Island {{representation}} in the state assembly has two Democrats and two Republicans. The 60th district is represented by Republican Nicole Malliotakis, and the 62nd, which encompasses most of the south shore of the island, by Joseph Borelli. But both the 61st and 63rd districts <b>have</b> <b>elected</b> Democrats, Matthew Titone and Michael J. Cusick. Staten Island is split between two State Senate Districts. Most of the island used to be represented by Republican John J. Marchi, the longest-serving legislator in state history; but is now represented by Republican Andrew Lanza; while the North Shore belongs to the Brooklyn-based district of Democrat Diane Savino.|$|E
25|$|In June 2006 Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) {{management}} {{announced that}} they <b>have</b> <b>elected</b> not to modify the Berkeley Hills Tunnel, which actually penetrates the Hayward Fault, arguing {{that it would be}} cheaper (and less disruptive to current operations) to rebore a misaligned portion after the fact than to protect riders (either by extensive modifications of the tunnel or by replacing it with a higher bore) against the small likelihood that a train (or two) would crash into or be cut in two by a major slippage of the fault. Modified train scheduling to prevent multiple train exposure at faults has been determined by BART engineers to be impractical due to variations in train passage, but automated event-related realtime train operational response is considered practical (see below).|$|E
