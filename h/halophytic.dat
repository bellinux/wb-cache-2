25|$|Central Anatolian steppe: These dry grasslands {{cover the}} drier valleys and {{surround}} the saline lakes of central Anatolia, and include <b>halophytic</b> (salt tolerant) plant communities.|$|E
25|$|These <b>halophytic</b> plants {{often occur}} in wet saline habitat types, and {{occasionally}} in dry saline soils. They {{can be found}} in habitats such as estuaries, salt marshes, tidal flats, seacliffs, salt pans, and saline sediment in seasonal desert waterways. An exception is Sarcocornia xerophila, growing in semidesert on quartz soils with low salinity.|$|E
25|$|Flora {{recorded}} in the Coastal Desert Ecoregion are: Herbaceous/grassy steppe species of Aerva javanica, Cymbopogon schoenanthus, Panicum turgidum, Lasiurus scindicus, Acacia tortilis, Acacia asak steppe, Rhigozum somalense, Caesalpinia erianthera shrubland. The coastal vegetation in this region consists of <b>halophytic</b> vegetation with mangroves species of Rhizophora mucronata, Ceriops tagal and Avicennia marina. The ecoregion also has xeric grasslands and shrublands in the inland areas of the coast.|$|E
25|$|The lagoon {{itself has}} {{several species of}} algae. In {{the fringes of the}} lake, Conocarpus erectus are {{reported}} and Typha domingensis are seen in the marshy region and fresh water streams and canals that have inlet into the lake. The lake has <b>halophytic</b> algae laid out as mattresses growing on its lake bed. Buttonwood mangroves (Conocorpus erectus) trees have large growth in the periphery of the lake. These are felled extensively to make charcoal.|$|E
25|$|Salt marshes {{are quite}} photosynthetically active and are {{extremely}} productive habitats. They serve as depositories {{for a large}} amount of organic matter and are full of decomposition, which feeds a broad food chain of organisms from bacteria to mammals. Many of the <b>halophytic</b> plants such as cordgrass are not grazed at all by higher animals but die off and decompose to become food for micro-organisms, which in turn become food for fish and birds.|$|E
25|$|During the Messinian {{salinity}} crisis (5.96 to 5.33 {{million years}} ago) the Mediterranean Sea partly desiccated and left widespread salt marshes and <b>halophytic</b> habitats. After the sea had flooded back, the marshes were fragmented and taxa became isolated. Subsequent climatic changes led to further diversification. The western wild beets later colonized the Macaronesian Islands during the Pleistocene, probably by adaptations of the diaspores for sea dispersal (thalassochory). On these islands, the diversification was quite recent, {{and seems to}} be complicated by events of hybridization and gene flow.|$|E
25|$|The <b>halophytic</b> sabkha type desert {{vegetation}} is predominant in Muscat. The Qurum Nature Reserve contains {{plants such}} as the Arthrocnemum Macrostachyum and Halopeplis Perfoliata Coral reefs are common in Muscat. Acropora reefs exist in the sheltered bays of the satellite towns of Jussah and Khairan. Additionally, smaller Porites reef colonies exist in Khairan, which have fused to form a flat-top pavement is visible at low tide. Crabs and spiny crayfish {{are found in the}} waters of the Muscat area, as are sardines and bonito. Glassfish are common in freshwater estuaries, such as the Qurum Nature Reserve.|$|E
25|$|Biotic factors here play a {{significant}} role in physical coastal evolution, and for wildlife a variety of habitats have developed which include beaches, estuaries, permanent and semi-permanent swamps, tidal flats, tidal creeks, coastal dunes, back dunes and levees. The mangrove vegetation itself assists in the formation of new landmass and the intertidal vegetation plays {{a significant}} role in swamp morphology. The activities of mangrove fauna in the intertidal mudflats develop micromorphological features that trap and hold sediments to create a substratum for mangrove seeds. The morphology and evolution of the eolian dunes is controlled by an abundance of xerophytic and <b>halophytic</b> plants. Creepers, grasses and sedges stabilise sand dunes and uncompacted sediments. The Sunderbans mudflats (Banerjee, 1998) are found at the estuary and on the deltaic islands where low velocity of river and tidal current occurs. The flats are exposed in low tides and submerged in high tides, thus being changed morphologically even in one tidal cycle. The tides are so large that approximately one third of the land disappears and reappears every day. The interior parts of the mudflats serve as a perfect home for mangroves.|$|E
