5|$|The Fab Five, the 1991 {{recruiting}} {{class of}} five freshman starters, were Chris Webber, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson. They were notable for having {{gone to the}} championship game of the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament as freshmen and sophomores, for having started the trend of wearing baggy <b>gym</b> <b>shorts,</b> which was later popularized by Michael Jordan, and for wearing black athletic socks. Due to the Ed Martin scandal, the records from their 1992 Final Four appearance and the entire following season have been forfeited. Although Webber was {{the only member of}} the Fab Five officially implicated with the scandal, the reputation of the whole group has been tarnished. Webber (1993), Howard (1994) and Rose (1992, 1994) were college basketball All-Americans. and both King (1995 3rd team and 1993 & 1994 honorable mention) and Jackson (1995 2nd team & 1994 honorable mention) achieved All-Big Ten honors. All but Jackson played in the NBA. They were the subject of Mitch Albom's book entitled Fab Five: Basketball, Trash Talk, the American Dream, which at one point was under development by Fox Television as a made-for-television movie. In March 2011 ESPN broadcast a documentary, Fab Five, that was the network's highest-rated in its history.|$|E

As they emerged from a faux silver subway car, she pranced across the stage, touching the hands of her fans. The show ended with Madonna racing up the stage to the subway doors, behind which she disappeared.

Customers could also learn a new fitness skill from scratch, with “starter” teaching sessions for those who have never participated in that exercise type before.|$|R
50|$|A dance belt {{is a type}} of thong {{designed}} {{to be used in the}} same manner as an athletic supporter, but for male dancers (especially in ballet). Its purpose is to protect and support the dancer during dance activities without being seen through outer garments, such as tights, leotard, <b>gym</b> leggings or <b>shorts.</b> Thongs tend to offer better support for the male anatomy than do other underwear styles (as well as eliminating contact between the genitals and inner thighs) and is one of the reasons why men and boys may choose to wear them.|$|R

2500|$|Hill and Giler did a {{first draft}} trying {{to enhance the}} story {{structure}} on the Fasano script, and feeling creatively drained hired Larry Ferguson as a script doctor. Ferguson's work was not well received in the production, particularly by Sigourney Weaver, who felt Ferguson made Ripley sound like [...] "a pissed-off <b>gym</b> teacher". <b>Short</b> on time before filming was due to commence, producers Walter Hill and David Giler {{took control of the}} screenplay themselves, melding aspects of the Ward/Fasano script with Twohy's earlier prison planet screenplay to create the basis of the final film. Sigourney Weaver had also had a clause written into her contract stating the final draft should be written by Hill and Giler, believing that they were the only writers (besides James Cameron) to write the character of Ripley effectively. [...] Fox approached music video director David Fincher to replace Ward. Fincher did further work on the screenplay with author Rex Pickett, and despite Pickett being fired and Hill and Giler writing the final draft of the screenplay, he revised most of the work done by the previous authors.|$|R
25|$|Lead {{climbing}} is a climbing technique. The lead climber ascends {{with the}} rope passing through intermittent anchors that are below them, {{rather than through}} a top anchor, as in a top-roped climb. A partner belays from below the lead climber, by feeding out enough rope to allow upward progression without undue slack. As the leader progresses he or she clips the rope into, using a runner and carabiners, intermediate points of protection such as active cams, or passive protection such as nuts; this limits {{the length of a}} potential fall. The leader also may clip into pre-placed bolts. Indoor <b>gyms</b> might have <b>short</b> runners pre-attached to fixed anchor points in the wall.|$|R

The school features an auditorium, swimming pool, and two gymnasiums. It also contains numerous science labs and demonstration rooms, computer labs, a library, and a cafeteria. The auditorium was designed to seat 1,500 with a balcony for 200. An organ was installed in the auditorium in 1931 by Estey Organ, identical to six others installed in other New York City high schools. The organ is no longer operational. The gyms are located on {{the second and third}} floors, intended for boys and girls respectively. The swimming pool, located in the basement below the <b>gyms</b> meets <b>short</b> course competition regulations, measuring 28 feet by 75 feet. The cafeteria is also at basement level. Today certain spaces such as the gyms and auditorium are shared between the current small schools.

The pre-1990s short shorts remain the standard for men in running activities. Originally, <b>gym</b> <b>shorts</b> were worn by boys and men along with a jockstrap only underneath. Schools across the country required boys to wear a jock, also known as an athletic supporter, for all PE/gym activities. This provided protection from testicle torsion, from squishing them between the thighs, and for modesty purposes. Nowadays, many boys and men wear boxers, boxer briefs, compression shorts, swim briefs or other standard underwear, although jockstraps are now making a comeback.|$|E

In September 1984 Jose Seys delivered a surprise knockout which shook Christie's confidence. Seven more wins followed, including a win over former Mexican champion Gonzalo Montes, before a disastrous bout with Mark Kaylor in a British middleweight title eliminator at Wembley Arena in November 1985 in which he was knocked out in the eighth round. After winning his next four fights, beating Nigerian champion Hunter Clay and former world welterweight challenger Sean Mannion, he suffered another setback when he was stopped by Charles Boston in December 1986. He won eight of his thirteen fights between June 1987 and October 1990, and in November 1990 faced Michael Watson at the National Exhibition Centre; Watson stopped him in the third round.

On the 2007 February 26 show, Pierre was in a skit where he reenacted some select scenes from the then-recent Academy Awards show.

When he notices Emma is sad about her awful first day, he teaches her how to surf. Broseph is also known to use certain things to his advantage, as seen in [...] "Board and Confused", when he bribed Johnny with {{discounts}} at his mom's surf shop and having some of her famous jambalaya in exchange for light or no hazing. His name is a portmanteau of Bro and Joseph, also with {{a connection to the}} term Brosef, which is Hawaiian slang meaning [...] "bro".

Broseph is 16 and wears a blue <b>gym</b> shirt, white <b>shorts,</b> and brown flip-flops. His swimsuit looks like his shorts too. In the first episode it is revealed that instead of needing a job like most employees, he chooses to work there willingly instead of working at his mother's surf shop, claiming he needed a change of scenery. His job now is being a bellhop. Broseph believes that surfing should be done for the thrills, instead of surfing for publicity and fame. He doesn't believe in competition, which leads people to believe that he is a true surfer. Broseph's voice actor is Mazin Elsadig.|$|R
50|$|Nowadays, <b>gym</b> <b>shorts</b> {{are worn}} by {{adolescents}} {{on a daily}} basis {{in the spring and summer}} months. While some boys prefer shorts that reach the calf, most wear shorts that stop at the knee or just above, propagating the style as fashion. The appeal of these knee length shorts as warm weather wear is diminishing as most adults find the added length of cloth restrictive and counterproductive in truly active or competitive sports. A modern example of this departure was evident during the 2012 Olympics when the USA men's volleyball team opted for the more athletic-friendly thigh length. The international volleyball federation (FIVB) now requires men's shorts to have an inseam of at most 10 centimeters (3.9 inches). Shorter cut <b>gym</b> <b>shorts</b> appear to be slowly returning to popularity for those that favor function over fashion.|$|E
