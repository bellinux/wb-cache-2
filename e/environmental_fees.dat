On average, 5 to 10 percent of this ends up as waste, which can pose environmental and health risks if disposed of improperly. Paint contains many components that have great potential for reuse, recycling and recovery. The Paint Recycling Alberta program enables these products to be handled and recycled in an environmentally safe manner, reducing {{their impact on the}} environment. The program is funded through <b>environmental</b> <b>fees</b> charged on the sale of new paint in Alberta.

40|$|Sweden has {{historically}} had strict emission control by implementation {{of economic policy}} instruments {{with the aim of}} internalising the external costs of air pollution. This study aims to evaluate how well current Swedish policy instruments reflect the environmental costs associated with heat generation in several district-heating (DH) plants in the DH system of Goteborg. Furthermore, it aims to simulate and evaluate the operation of the DH system based on its social cost-effectiveness which takes into account the DH system's private and external costs (non-internalised environmental costs). The study shows that the economic policy instruments do not fully internalise all external costs whereas for certain technologies, the costs in terms of taxes, emission permits, <b>environmental</b> <b>fees,</b> etc. are higher than the environmental costs caused by the pollutants, given the environmental cost estimates used in the study. The simulation results show that the deviating internalisation of external costs affects the economic ranking of the different plants within the studied DH system. The estimated loss in social-cost effectiveness of the operation of the DH system of Goteborg is noticable but relatively small if compared to the variable heat generation costs for most of the studied DH plants.

40|$|Vanuatu is {{a low-income}} {{country with a}} per capita income of about US$ 1, 200 a year. It suffers {{from a number of}} major {{constraints}} in its efforts to achieve its development objectives. One constraint is a widely scattered and mountainous island geography, with the population scattered across the islands, in association with poor transport infrastructure. Vanuatu is also vulnerable to natural disasters and suffers from a small domestic market with little potential for economies of scale. Approximately 77 % of the population lives in rural areas. Vanuatu is particularly affected by negative impacts of climate change. Already now, inhabitants suffer from extreme weathers as mentioned above, but also from the erosion of coast lines, floods and – on the atolls – water scarcity. Vanuatu does not have an established system of <b>environmental</b> <b>fees</b> and charges and is possibly foregoing some of the revenues that other countries have been raising for many years. Given the state and further development of the fiscal situation and of the environment and natural resources, there is a large potential for developing proposals for EFR-elements. Public revenue from taxes has increased steadily throughout the last decade and stood at 21 % of GDP in 2009. At the moment tax revenue in Vanuatu is overwhelmingly dependent on a value-added tax and taxes on international trade (44 per cent and 38 per cent respectively in 2009) ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{sets out}} {{problems}} experienced in current power plant performance calculation methodology. With {{changes in the}} electricity market and the increased role of computer control and diagnostic system, the previ-ous methodology is fast becoming obsolete. Several key factors are highlighted (for example, reference values and corrective curves) which may lead to highly imprecise and inadequate evaluations of plant performance and, especially, operator behavior. It is important {{to bear in mind}} the systemic changes on the energy mar-ket. The current methodology focuses on controlling factors impacting power generating efficiency whereas the modern market is more complex and real costs are largely dependent on other variable costs, such as <b>environmental</b> <b>fees,</b> equipment wearing costs and the energy trading market. Statistical analysis of data is proposed as a modification of the current methodology. As most heat rate calculation is done on-line, it is possible to analyze this data in detail and apply, for example, PCA (Principle Component Analysis) and linear (and nonlinear) regression, thereby enabling a more accurate determination of the influence of principle process parameters on heat rate deviation. The article presents sample results of comprehensive analysis (two cases from different plants) of two twin units (heat rate calculation and process data analysis from a 12 -month period) which to demonstrate the clear need to modify and update the old performance calculation approach. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{environmental}} effectiveness of fees {{for using the}} environment (“environmental fees”) charged in Poland is demonstrated by their incentive function, which motivates organisations using the environment to behave in the appropriate, environmentally-friendly way. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to assess how well the fees fulfil this function. The incentive function is evaluated by analysing the quantity of pollution emitted into the air, water and soil, the quantity of waste landfilled and of water taken in within the context of changes to unit fee rates in 2005 - 2011. This study was conducted using data obtained from the Marshall’s Office of the Silesian District (Śląsk) of Poland, which transferred the highest <b>environmental</b> <b>fees</b> over the period of 2008 - 2011 [NFOŚiGW (National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management), Informacja [...] . ].

The assessment of the incentive function based on the figures from one district, (Voivodship), is illustrative in nature and one can only presume that the trends observed in this area, which uses the environment to a large extent, will also be true for data from the entire country and thus significantly impact the national average.

40|$|The {{system of}} para-fiscal levies implies {{different}} types of benefits or compensation and payment of citizens and companies {{for the use of}} goods or services of state administration which are para-fiscal sources of income of the state. The main characteristics of para-fiscal levies are: they do not originate from all tax payers, but only from members of certain social groups that are linked to some common economic or social interests; they {{are not part of the}} budget funds and not regulate them fiscal authorities; they have the character of destined public revenues, as they regularly represent a dedicated revenue whit which a specific task of economic or social character would be solved; they represent a secondary tax levy, which means that they exist along with the country’s tax levy, to draw funds from the same economic resources and to have almost the same economic effects, as well as the collection of taxes; they shall be paid on the basis of laws and decisions or decision of the competent authorities (general obligation) or by contract (a specific levy, ie. an individual obligation); they shall be paid in the event of use of property of general interest and / or services of state administration; they represent giving of money, which is always direct, ie. giving cash on the basis of the decision and with the issuance of a receipt of payment (receipt from a box office or bank). Para-fiscal levies should be understood as fees that economic operators and citizens pay for the use of certain goods or services. These are not taxes and they do not serve to fill the budget. However, in Bosnia and Herzegovina the biggest part of para-fiscal levies is used as a parallel budget revenue, as revenue for the operation of the costly administrative apparatus. A large number of studies on para-fiscal levies in Bosnia and Herzegovina showed that they have a negative impact on economic growth and development. Basically para-fiscal levies, for business entities at higher levels of government, can be grouped into 25 fee and tax groups, and in 9 groups of special fees and membership fees (federal administrative fees, federal court fees, water fees, road fees, forest fees, <b>environmental</b> <b>fees,</b> fees for protection against natural and other disasters) ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{undertook}} a critical {{examination of the}} relationship between perception of environmental harm and consumer willingness to pay for <b>environmental</b> handling <b>fees</b> (EHF). This analysis was supplemented by asking study participants to indicate under what circumstances (and for what materials) they believe a visible fee is appropriate. This study found that there is a statistically significant correlation between willingness to pay <b>environmental</b> handling <b>fees</b> and the perceived environmental harm of the product on which the fee is applied. For items that respondents viewed as “innocuous to the environment” (i. e., “keyboards and mice”), they were relatively unwilling to pay an <b>environmental</b> handling <b>fee.</b> Conversely, for the full range of hazardous waste materials, consumers expressed a willingness to pay EHFs. With respect to fee visibility, respondents indicated that they preferred visible fees (at the sticker) for products that they perceived to be dangerous. There is a strong correlation between perceived environmental harm and whether fees should be visible. Consumers are not necessarily averse to paying an eco fee on products (be they hazardous waste, electronic waste, etc.), but their willingness to do so is almost entirely a function of whether they believe the product is environmentally burdensome. It is the recommendation of this study that promotion and education campaigns for <b>environmental</b> handling <b>fees,</b> particularly those surrounding waste electronics, place greater emphasis on environmental consequences of improper disposal...|$|R
