5|$|With Carltron's defeat, {{the monsters}} plaguing Evermore disappear, {{but the world}} itself grows unstable. The boy returns {{to each of the}} worlds to collect Ruffleberg's companions, taking them back to the real world. In doing so, Evermore's {{destruction}} is averted and it continues to exist without them. After the credits roll, a final scene shows Professor Ruffleberg returning Carltron to his old task of cleaning the lab. Carltron grins and rubs <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together,</b> implying that he is not as docile as the professor believes.|$|E
5|$|He {{is known}} to have absorbed the {{abilities}} of Luke Cage, Vision, Red Hulk and Protector, and it is suggested that he also absorbed the abilities of his current Dark Avengers. In his final form, his body grew to the Hulk's size, and like Hulk he was capable of creating shockwaves by hitting the ground or smashing <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together.</b> His durability was sufficient to withstand the combined attacks of all the Avengers, and he demonstrated remarkable healing abilities, recovering in seconds after Daisy Johnson used her powers to make his heart explode. He could also turn intangible by manipulating his density, as the Vision does.|$|E

500|$|Critic and {{musician}} Brian Priestley {{wrote that}} [...] "What was so distinctive about Dodo's work was partly his harmonic sense {{and knowledge of}} the additional notes [...] Many pianists were trying to find ways to voice these satisfactorily in full chording, but none did so as pleasingly or as fluently as Marmarosa. Partly it was also the way he alternated between employing <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> and in opposition to each other, and allied to this was his unusual time feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Hiroshima bomb detonated successfully, Oppenheimer {{addressed}} {{an assembly}} at Los Alamos [...] "clasping <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> like a prize-winning boxer". The bombing amazed Otto Hahn and other German atomic scientists the British held at Farm Hall in Operation Epsilon. Hahn {{stated that he}} had not believed an atomic weapon [...] "would be possible for another twenty years"; Werner Heisenberg did not believe the news at first. Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker said [...] "I think it's dreadful of the Americans to have done it. I think it is madness on their part", but Heisenberg replied, [...] "One could equally well say 'That's the quickest way of ending the war'". Hahn was grateful that the German project had not succeeded in developing [...] "such an inhumane weapon"; Karl Wirtz observed that even if it had, [...] "we would have obliterated London but would still not have conquered the world, and then they would have dropped them on us".|$|E
500|$|After {{about three}} months spent in the Tower, on Saturday 3 May 1606 Garnet was {{strapped}} to a wooden hurdle and taken by three horses to the churchyard of St Paul's. He wore a black cloak over his clothes and hat, and {{spent much of the}} journey with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> and eyes closed. Present in the churchyard were the Sheriff of London, Sir Henry Montague, George Abbot and John Overal. When asked if he had knowledge of any further treasons, Garnet replied that he had nothing to say. He rejected any entreatments to abandon his faith for Protestantism, and said that he had committed no offence against the king. [...] The only thing he thought he might be condemned for was for abiding by the terms of the confessional, and if by that action he had offended the king or state, he asked for forgiveness. The recorder announced that this was an admission of guilt, but Garnet reiterated his not guilty plea and continued to argue the point.|$|E

500|$|Physicist Isidor Rabi noticed Oppenheimer's disconcerting triumphalism: [...] "I'll {{never forget}} his walk; I'll {{never forget the}} way {{he stepped out of}} the car... his walk was like High Noon... this kind of strut. He had done it." [...] At an {{assembly}} at Los Alamos on August 6 (the evening of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima), Oppenheimer took to the stage and clasped <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> [...] "like a prize-winning boxer" [...] while the crowd cheered. He noted his regret the weapon had not been available in time to use against Nazi Germany. However, he and many of the project staff were very upset about the bombing of Nagasaki, as they did not feel the second bomb was necessary from a military point of view. He traveled to Washington on August 17 to hand-deliver a letter to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson expressing his revulsion and his wish to see nuclear weapons banned. In October 1945 Oppenheimer was granted an interview with President Harry S Truman. The meeting, however, went badly, after Oppenheimer remarked he felt he had [...] "blood on my hands". The remark infuriated Truman {{and put an end to}} the meeting. Truman later told his Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson [...] "I don't want to see that son-of-a-bitch in this office ever again." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward Elric is the {{youngest}} State Alchemist to be selected by the State Military of the country, receiving the title of [...] "Fullmetal Alchemist" [...] shortly thereafter from the military head, King Bradley. He and his younger brother, Alphonse, seek to obtain the legendary Philosopher's Stone in order to restore their bodies after a disastrous failed attempt to bring their mother back to life through alchemy. Edward {{was born in a}} small town named Resembool, where he lived with Alphonse and his parents, Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim. After Hohenheim left the family on a journey early in his sons' lives, and Trisha died of an illness years later, the two young boys concentrated on studying alchemy in the hopes of bringing their mother back to life, and trained with a skilled alchemist named Izumi Curtis. They attempt to revive their mother and failed, costing Edward his left leg, and Alphonse his entire body. During this first transmutation, Edward sees the , thus gaining great knowledge as well as the prodigious ability to perform transmutations just by clapping <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together.</b> Edward then performed a second transmutation, sacrificing his own right arm to bind Alphonse's soul to a nearby suit of armor. In order to move with his lost limbs, Edward has had prosthetic [...] "automail" [...] limbs designed and implemented by his childhood friend, Winry Rockbell. Winry is often kept busy repairing Edward's automail, as he regularly breaks and damages the machines during heavy bouts. As the series continues, the two progressively develop a romantic relationship, eventually confessing their feelings to each other by the series' end.|$|E

2500|$|Tevez {{is known}} for his tango flare goal {{celebrations}} ever since playing for Boca Juniors, as well with Corinthians of Brazil.

After his move to Manchester City, Tevez often performed a dance where he puts <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together,</b> bends down and rocks his body; this dance has been named after him as the [...] "Tevez Dance".|$|E

Faith has moved mountains." [...] When Esteban Rojas {{stepped out of the}} rescue capsule, he immediately knelt on the ground with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> in prayer then raised his arms above him in adoration. His wife then wrapped a tapestry bearing the image of The Virgin Mary around him as they hugged and cried.|$|E

[...] They discuss choreographing and directing the film's violent scenes in the Sydney Morning Herald: [...] "'That stuff is such fun to do', the brothers chime in {{at the mention of}} their penchant for blood-letting. 'Even Javier would come in {{by the end of the}} movie, rub <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> and say, 'OK, who am I killing today?' adds Joel. 'It's fun to figure out', says Ethan.

2500|$|The Major League {{record for}} the most balks in one game is held by Bob Shaw, who had five balks in a May 4, 1963, game while {{pitching}} for the Milwaukee Braves against the Chicago Cubs. [...] Four of the five balks came when the Cubs' Billy Williams was on base: one in the first inning, then three more in the third inning. In the latter frame, Shaw walked Williams, and then proceeded to balk him to second, third and home. [...] Shaw's balks were blamed on his difficulty adjusting to a then-new point of emphasis in the rules: umpires were told to enforce {{the section of the}} balk rule strictly that required the pitcher, when going from the stretch to the set position, to come to a complete stop with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> for one full second before pitching. [...] The rule had been virtually ignored before.|$|E

2500|$|Joffre sent {{a copy of}} {{his plan}} to GHQ and asked Millerand to lobby the British Government. [...] Hearing at last that Sir John was willing to co-operate, Joffre arrived for a meeting with French at (2pm on 5 September). [...] According to Spears' account, he {{explained}} his plan (in French), ending by clasping <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>together</b> tightly enough to hurt them and begging [...] "Monsieur le Maréchal, c'est la France qui vous supplie" [...] ("Field Marshal, France is begging you"). [...] Sir John listened with tears rolling down his reddening cheeks and, unable to find the words in French, replied [...] "Damn it, I can't explain. [...] Tell him that all that men can do our fellows will do". [...] When Murray protested that the BEF could not be ready as soon as Joffre hoped, Joffre replied that Sir John's word was good enough for him. Joffre and Gamelin recorded Joffre's words slightly differently in their memoirs, as: [...] "il y a que l'honneur de l'Angleterre" [...] ("the honour of England (sic) is at stake"), but Spears' account more closely matches the contemporary diaries of Wilson and Clive, and so is in Prete's view more likely to be correct. Although Joffre had dealt tactfully with Sir John (he later claimed in his memoirs that his visit to Melun had simply been to congratulate Sir John on his willingness to co-operate), {{at a time when he}} sacked three of his own army commanders (including Lanrezac), ten corps commanders, and thirty-eight divisional commanders— Neillands writes that [...] "one cannot help wonder" [...] whether French would not have suffered the same fate had he reported directly to Joffre. Joffre believed at the time that the BEF were technically under his orders and that French's uncooperativeness was because the British government were too weak to insist that he obey orders. [...] French was conscious that he was Joffre's senior in rank and had more combat experience.|$|E
