The restoration of the façade revealed much paint adhering to the statues and their niches, indicating that it had once been brightly coloured.|$|E
5|$|The skins or {{heads of}} taiko are {{generally}} made from cowhide from Holstein cows aged {{about three or}} four years. Skins also come from horses, and bull skin is preferred for larger drums. Thinner skins are preferred for smaller taiko, and thicker skins are used for larger ones. On some drumheads, a patch of deer skin placed in the center serves as the target for many strokes during performance. Before fitting it to the drum body the hair is removed from the hide by soaking it in a river or stream for about a month; winter months are preferred as colder temperatures better facilitate hair removal. To stretch the skin over the drum properly, one process requires the body to be held on a platform with several hydraulic jacks underneath it. The edges of the cowhide are secured to an apparatus below the jacks, and the jacks stretch the skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead. Other forms of stretching use rope or cords with wooden <b>dowels</b> or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension. Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes. Particularly large drumheads are sometimes stretched by having several workers, clad in stockings, hop rhythmically atop it, forming a circle along the edge. After the skin has dried, tacks, called byō, are added to the appropriate drums to secure it; chū-daiko require about 300 of them for each side. After the body and skin have been finished, excess hide is cut off and the drum can be stained as needed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dowels</b> and rivets are {{physical}} ways {{in which}} ceramics can be reinforced and strengthen beneath the surface. <b>Dowels</b> are cylindrical rods that consist of wood, metal, or plastic. They are drilled into the ceramic piece and usually are set in the hole with an adhesive {{that is used to}} repair the ceramic piece. Removing <b>dowels</b> can be hard because they lie under the surface and are usually hidden. Conservators will cut through <b>dowels</b> with a piercing saw and soften the area with a solvent, like acetone to remove two pieces of ceramic from one another.|$|E
30|$|<b>Dowel</b> {{bars are}} {{commonly}} used in jointed plain concrete pavements (JPCP) as a load transfer device across joints, especially for pavements with heavy traffic. The primary advantage of <b>dowel</b> bars is to transfer load without restricting horizontal joint movements due to temperature and moisture expansion and contraction in the concrete slabs. Also, <b>dowel</b> bars play a role to maintain the vertical and horizontal alignment of slabs. The load transfer efficiency depends {{on a number of}} dowel-joint parameters, including modulus of <b>dowel</b> support, <b>dowel</b> bar diameter, <b>dowel</b> length, <b>dowel</b> bar spacing, <b>dowel</b> looseness, joint opening width, and subgrade strength (Channakeshava et al. 1993; Guo et al. 1993; Brill and Guo 2000; Kim and Hjelmstad 2003; Maitra et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|PURPOSES: The problem {{under this}} {{circumstance}} {{is that the}} erosion not only drops strength of the steel <b>dowel</b> bar but also comes with volume expansion of the steel <b>dowel</b> bar which can reduce load transferring efficiency of the steel <b>dowel</b> bar. To avoid this erosion problem, alternative dowers bars are developed. METHODS: In this study, the bearing stresses between the FRP tube <b>dowel</b> bar and concrete slab are calculated and compared with its allowable bearing stress to check its structural stability in the concrete pavement. These comparisons are conducted with several cross-sections of FRP tube <b>dowel</b> bars. Comprehensive laboratory tests including the shear load-deflection test on a full-scale specimen and the full-scale accelerated joint concrete pavement test are conducted {{and the results were}} compared with those from the steel <b>dowel</b> bar. RESULTS: In all cross-sections of FRP tube <b>dowel</b> bars, computed bearing stresses between the FRP tube <b>dowel</b> bar and concrete slab are less than their allowable stress levels. The pultrusion FRP-tube <b>dowel</b> bar show better performance on direct shear tests on full-scale specimen and static compression tests at full-scale concrete pavement joints than prepreg and filament-winding FRP-tube <b>dowel</b> bar.

40|$|Abstract: The load {{transfer}} mechanism between the <b>dowel</b> and the concrete {{is a complex}} phenomenon. This mechanism depends mainly on a parameter known as the modulus of <b>dowel</b> support (K), the value {{of which can be}} determined by load testing. A high modulus of <b>dowel</b> support value indicates a good contact between the concrete and the steel <b>dowel.</b> There is a lack of sound approach to identify with any degree of accuracy the modulus of <b>dowel</b> support (k), which makes it difficult to rely on the analytically developed formulas that are sensitive to its value.

25|$|This {{produces}} a joint {{which is much}} stronger than a butt joint without reinforcement. The <b>dowels</b> offer some holding strength even after the glue has deteriorated. Over time, <b>dowels</b> may shrink and become loose. They take on an oval shape in section owing to the different rate at which wood moves with different orientations of the grain. Loose <b>dowels</b> allow the joint to flex, although it may not fall apart. This phenomenon is evident in creaking chairs and wobbling book cases. For this reason, dowel joints are not preferred for high-quality furniture.|$|E

30|$|Although {{previous}} research {{reported that the}} pavement with a special <b>dowel</b> bar arrangement shows a good filed performance, {{there is a need}} to study how the reduced number of <b>dowel</b> bars achieves the appropriate load transfer across the joints in terms of the concrete bearing stress, <b>dowel</b> shear forces, and slab deflection. Also, a better understanding regarding the <b>dowel</b> bar load transfer mechanism may help to improve the <b>dowel</b> bar design and construction procedures. In this study, a three-dimensional (3 -D) finite-element (FE) model was developed to simulate the <b>dowel</b> bar load transfer under FWD loads.

25|$|Wollaston made {{improvements}} to the galvanic battery (named after Galvani) in the 1810s. In Wollaston's battery, the wooden box was replaced with an earthenware vessel, and a copper plate was bent into a U-shape, with a single plate of zinc placed {{in the center of}} the bent copper. The zinc plate was prevented from making contact with the copper by <b>dowels</b> (pieces) of cork or wood. In his single cell design, the U-shaped copper plate was welded to a horizontal handle for lifting the copper and zinc plates out of the electrolyte when the battery was not in use.|$|E
25|$|Commonly used {{woodworking}} tools included axes, adzes, chisels, pull saws, and bow drills. Mortise and tenon joints are attested {{from the}} earliest Predynastic period.

Ancient Egyptians invented the art of veneering and used varnishes for finishing, though the composition of these varnishes is unknown. Although different native acacias were used, as was the wood from the local sycamore and tamarisk trees, deforestation in the Nile valley resulted in {{the need for the}} importation of wood, notably cedar, but also Aleppo pine, boxwood and oak, starting from the Second Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Different populations within Cape Dwarf Chameleons {{were found}} to have {{different}} preferences regarding Perch Diameter. The two main populations, Kogelberg and Stellenbosch, were seen to have different behavior. Kogelberg tended to use perches that were significantly wider on average than perches used by the Stellenbosch site which chose perches by random. Hand size has a direct correlation with grip strength on both broad and narrow <b>dowels,</b> rod-like structures, in both populations. The longer the tail length, the greater the strength. This species prefers to sleep on perches of specific diameters that correspond to their specific morphology. Animals from habitats characterized by wider perches are also stronger than their counterparts living in habitats with narrow branches. This has led to sexual selection for chameleons with specific traits like hand size and tail length.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model for the}} <b>dowel</b> action of reinforcement bars crossing cracks in concrete is developed for finite element analysis of concrete structures. The beam on elastic foundation theory is used to derive the <b>dowel</b> force-displacement relationship, which is expressed in a smeared form in terms of <b>dowel</b> stress and strain {{in order to be}} compatible with the smeared crack and smeared reinforcement models commonly used in finite element analysis. This <b>dowel</b> action model is incorporated in a finite element program that employs secant stiffness formulation and a displacement controlled iteration scheme for nonlinear analysis. Using the finite element program, the nonlinear behaviors of several reinforced concrete beams tested by others are analyzed well into the post-peak range. The beams are analyzed first with the <b>dowel</b> action neglected and then again with the <b>dowel</b> action incorporated. It is found that in certain cases, the <b>dowel</b> action can have significant effects on the shear strength and ductility of reinforced concrete beams and that the analytical results generally agree better with the experimental values when the <b>dowel</b> action is taken into account. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Masonry of all types was used for ancient Greek buildings, including rubble, but the finest ashlar masonry was usually employed for temple walls, in regular courses and large sizes to minimise the joints. The blocks were rough hewn and hauled from quarries to be cut and bedded very precisely, with mortar hardly ever being used.

25|$|Islamic {{rule over}} {{northern}} and central India {{brought with it}} the use of domes constructed with stone, brick and mortar, and iron <b>dowels</b> and cramps.

The synthesis of styles created by this introduction of new forms to the Hindu tradition of trabeate construction created a distinctive architecture. Domes in pre-Mughal India have a standard squat circular shape with a lotus design and bulbous finial at the top, derived from Hindu architecture. Because the Hindu architectural tradition did not include arches, flat corbels were used to transition from the corners of the room to the dome, rather than squinches. In contrast to Persian and Ottoman domes, the domes of Indian tombs tend to be more bulbous.|$|E
25|$|The first {{dedicated}} war galleys {{fitted with}} rams were built with a {{mortise and tenon}} technique, a so-called shell-first method. In this, the planking of the hull {{was strong enough to}} hold the ship together structurally, and was also watertight without the need for caulking. Hulls had sharp bottoms without keelsons in order to support the structure and were reinforced by transverse framing secured with <b>dowels</b> with nails driven through them. To prevent the hull from hogging there was a hypozoma, a thick cable that connected bow with stern. It was kept taut to add strength to the construction along its length, but its exact design or the method of tightening is not known. The ram, the primary weapon of ancient galleys from around the 8th to the 4th century, was not attached directly on the hull but to a structure extending from it. This way the ram could twist off if got stuck after ramming rather than breaking the integrity of the hull. The ram fitting consisted of a massive, projecting timber and the ram itself was a thick bronze casting with horizontal blades that could weigh from 400kg up to 2 tonnes.|$|E

Field performance evaluation was conducted in terms of longitudinal crack, transverse crack, corner crack, spalling, and load transfer efficiency (LTE). Also, a three-dimensional (3 -D) finite element (FE) model was developed to evaluate change in structural response characteristics due to different <b>dowel</b> bar arrangements under the critical loading condition. The developed FE model was used to perform a parametric analysis {{to determine the effects}} of different <b>dowel</b> bar arrangements. Results indicated that no significant changes in pavement structural responses, including the slab stresses and deflections, were predicted between two <b>dowel</b> bar arrangements that may result in no significant difference in expected performance for the test slabs evaluated, and this matched well with results of field performance evaluation. Also, it was indicated that the base modulus plays an important role on the dowel-joint behavior and stiffer base condition could significantly improve the dowel-joint performance. Therefore, when the base layer is stiff enough to support the slab deflection and resist erosion (e.g., AC layer), special <b>dowel</b> bar arrangement could provide similar performance as compared to standard <b>dowel</b> bar arrangement that result in significant cost savings without any negative effects on expected pavement performance.|$|R
