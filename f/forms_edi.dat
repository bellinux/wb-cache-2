40|$|The use of {{information}} technology in business-to-business transactions (commonly referred to as B 2 B E-Commerce) has gained {{a lot of attention}} throughout the last years. Even though the euphoria about the possibilities of using electronic media has subsided, IT has subtly altered the way companies do transactions. B 2 B E-Commerce can take many different <b>forms</b> (<b>EDI,</b> E-Shops, etc.). In this research, we focus on Electronic B 2 B Marketplaces. Electronic B 2 B Marketplaces are information systems that bring together several business buyers and business sellers and facilitate their transactions by using electronic communication. Electronic markets have for some time been the object of study of research. Drawing on New Institutionalism, scholars like Thomas Malone argued that electronic markets would encourage a shift towards more market-like coordination of transactions (cf. Malone/Yates/Benjamin 1987). Following their line of arguments would imply concluding that closeness in existing buyer-supplier-relationships should be reduced. Empirical verification of these hypotheses has been limited so far. The question whether the use o...|$|E

Network flagships can now select best-performing suppliers on a global scale, increasing the pressure on Asian suppliers. But the transition <b>form</b> <b>EDI</b> to the Internet may also provide new opportunities for Asian suppliers, by reducing barriers to network entry, and by enhancing knowledge diffusion. A conceptual framework is introduced to assess how the Internet reshapes business organization and GPN. That framework is applied {{to one of the}} role models of managing in Asia, Taiwan's Acer Group. The paper highlights a vicious circle that must be broken to reap the benefits of the Internet: Asian firms must reduce a huge efficiency gap between manufacturing and the management of supporting digital information systems (DIS). The challenge is to embrace the Internet as flexible infrastructures that support not only information exchange, but also knowledge sharing, creation and utilization.

Various lymphoid organs were removed i and 24 hr after injection to assess local proliferation and migra-tion of newly formed cells, respectively. In cell suspensions, surface staining was per-formed for macrophage subsets (EDi, ED 2, ED 3), and the DNA label BRDU was detected by a monoclonal antibody. Local proliferation of EDi macrophages occurred in all organs investigated {{with the exception of}} the blood. Bone marrow outweighed the other organs by far; in addition to the proliferating EDi promonocytes, the bone marrow also contained BRDU-labeled ED 2 macrophages.

The framework takes into account institutional, industry specific and organizational factors and thus extends the analysis beyond organizational borders. The framework delivers an account of EDI diffusion in Denmark based on field study data. The field study covers three industries in Denmark; the finance, the retail and the transportation sector. The study clarifies how organizational, industry and environmental factors simultaneous are brought to bear to understand the diffusion process. The content analysis distinguishes six diffusion patterns and associated mechanisms that mold diffusion patterns in three diffusion arenas: local dyadic relationships, industry networks, and national initiatives.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Nutrition)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. Background: Modern {{culture has}} stereotyped the divine female body {{as one that}} is {{continually}} getting leaner, with the internalization of the “thin” ideal possibly resulting in body dissatisfaction, disturbances in body image and exploitation of extreme weight control measures. These shoddy eating behaviours/attitudes may involve body mass and figure anxiety, sub-optimal nutrition or insufficient energy intake (possibly even a combination of both) and use of pathogenic weight control measures (PWCM). Furthermore, low energy availability can be a consequence of disordered eating (DE) behaviour, but can also inadvertently emerge {{in the absence of}} clinical eating disorders, DE behaviours and/or restricted dietary intake. Various researchers have concluded that dancers are overly-concerned about dieting and their body mass, and tend to be discontented with their bodies. Every organ system in the body may potentially be negatively affected {{as a result of the}} ensuing undernourishment and/or weight loss related to poor nutritional behaviour. The aim of the study was to investigate the DE behaviour, PWCM use, body image and energy status of a group of University female dancers Methods: Fifty two volunteer (18 - 30 years) dancers (n= 26) matched by controls (n= 26) of the same race, and comparable age and body mass index were recruited. DE behaviour was assessed with the Eating disorder inventory- 3 (EDI 3), Cognitive dietary restraint (CDR) subscale of the Three-factor eating questionnaire (TFEQ) and <b>EDI</b> 3 referral <b>form</b> (<b>EDI</b> 3 -RF) behavioural questions. Body image was assessed using the Body Silhouette Assessment Scale. Energy status was assessed using a 5 -day weighed food record to measure energy intake and Actiheart® monitor to measure energy expenditure. Results: Dancers presented with significantly higher EDI 3 -Drive for thinness, EDI 3 -Body dissatisfaction and TFEQ-CDR raw subscale scores when compared to controls. Furthermore, the majority of dancers scored above the designated cut-off scores for the EDI 3 -Drive for thinness (46. 2 %), EDI 3 -Body dissatisfaction (61. 5 %), EDI-Bulimia (53. 9 %) and TFEQ-CDR (52. 0 %) subscales. Bingeing was the most common PWCM used by both dancers and controls (19. 2 % vs. 23. 1 %), followed by weight loss ≥ 9 kg within the preceding 6 months (11. 5 % vs. 15. 4 %). Vomiting (7. 7 %), laxatives (11. 5 %) and excessive exercise (19. 2 %) for weight loss were used only by the dancers. Current body weight was significantly different to desired body weight for the dancers only (p= 0. 0004). The discrepancy between current and ideal body image, also termed Feel Minus Ideal Discrepancy (FID), was significantly different between dancers and controls, and indicated that controls were content with their body silhouette while dancers were inclined to want to lose weight. A negative energy balance was found in 80. 8 % of both dancers and controls. The energy availability of 48. 0 % of dancers and 52. 0 % of controls was between 30 and 45 kcal/kg fat-free mass/day. A total of 65. 4 % of dancers and 38. 5 % of controls reported to be currently trying to lose weight. Conclusion: Irrespective of the limitations of this study, noteworthy observations were made pertaining to the DE behaviour, body image, and energy status of a group of South African student women dancers. This group of South African university women dancers were vulnerable to DE behaviour, had a propensity to be greatly displeased with their body image, and possessed a low energy status possibly because they were trying to lose weight.

40|$|Extra-dyadic {{involvement}} (EDI) is {{a complex}} issue that affects many individuals, couples, and families. One important, relatively unexplored issue concerns the disclosure of EDI. Despite some scholarly discourse on whether disclosure should be facilitated in a therapeutic context (e. g., Butler et al. in J Marital Fam Ther 35 : 125 – 143, 2009; Butler et al. in Am J Fam Ther 36 : 265 – 283, 2008), empirical research has not studied the intrapersonal or interpersonal processes related to disclosure. In this study, we explored potential factors involved {{in the decision to}} disclose EDI by looking at the relationships among attitudes towards EDI (in terms of perceived justifications and costs), subjective norms (obligation to disclose), and perceived behavioral control (difficulty) associated with EDI disclosure. Our sample included 337 individuals enrolled in at least one university course at one of three geographically distinct universities. Findings indicate that more permissive attitudes towards EDI are not significantly associated to the perceived difficulty in disclosing EDI or the obligation associated with disclosing EDI involving sexual intercourse. However, more permissive attitudes are related to lower felt obligation to disclose EDI that does not involve direct sexual intercourse. Conversely, more restrictive attitudes towards EDI (perceived severity, degree of perceived upset, and how detrimental it is perceived to be to the relationship) predicted greater difficulty but also greater obligation in disclosing all <b>forms</b> of <b>EDI.</b> Specific implications of these findings, including potential implications for therapy, are discussed. Overall, this study provides preliminary information regarding potentially useful factors to consider in understanding the EDI disclosure process that may also be useful in developing intervention points in therapy...|$|R

E-Business usage and its adoption are mentioned in first part of this paper. The Internet and information and communication technology (ICT) evolution are important factors in e-Business. Large companies use e-Business because of costs reduction and more effective systems of ordering and selling. E-Business adoption is not very useful and profitable for small and middle sized companies. The second part of this paper is about practical e-Business implementation in Continental AG Company.

40|$|This {{project has}} two primary {{objectives}}. Both objectives will {{be achieved through}} research of current data and the creation, distribution and analysis of a business forms industry survey. The first objective was {{to draw attention to}} the growing demand for electronic substitutes for traditional printed business forms, and educate the business forms industry about the biggest threat and opportunity of these technologies, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). This was accomplished by outlining the technology and processes of EDI and describing the various benefits of EDI over traditional printed business forms systems. Such educational descriptions and analysis were necessary due to the lack of attention given to the intense growth in electronic substitutes by business forms trade publications and leaders. The second objective was to quantify the level of awareness that exists for EDI throughout the business forms industry, assess the current and future investment in and development of <b>EDI</b> and electronic <b>forms</b> software and systems by the major forms producing companies of the U. S. and identify what level of leadership has been received with regards to combating or investing in these technologies. The answers to these questions represent new information not currently in existence. A survey of business forms producers was necessary to attain much of this information. The educational information predominantly focuses on EDI instead. of the complete range of electronic substitutes for business forms due to the significant effect that this one technology has. A wide range of sources were consulted, from business forms industry reports to EDI promoters to governmental commerce statistics. This extensive literature search confirmed my earliest convictions that there is a lack of leadership and of significant educational information, at least in accessible print, about the threats and opportunities of EDI and other electronic technologies. A survey of 155 randomly selected forms producers from a population of approximately 500, netted 40 respondents. Most respondents were small producers who had experienced increases in both sales and profits in the past year. The survey shows that forms producers claim to have a fair degree of knowledge about EDI, believe that EDI will have a significant affect on the business <b>forms</b> industry, and <b>EDI</b> offers a fair degree of advantage over the traditional business forms system. Most respondents do not, however, monitor their customers use of electronic substitues for business forms. Most respondents do not invest in electronic technologies as a product or service alternative to current business forms. When asked about their desired role in providing such technologies and future participation in an EDI VAN service project, most respondents were favorable to the ideas. When asked if the forms industry leadership had done enough to educate them about electronic technology threats and opportunities, respondents definitely felt neglected and desired more information. The comments respondents wrote on the surveys were interesting but showed a general lack of understanding for what investment in new technologies really entails. Surprisingly, despite the small size of most of the firms responding to the survey and the fact that most had experienced increased profits, most expressed their feelings that they had a good understanding of EDI, EDI had significant advantages over there products and services and they are interested in investing in new technonlogies. In general it is clear, but perhaps not definitively conclusive, that hypotheses 1 and 2 are false and hypotheses 3 and 4 are true. Further questions are probed and answered in the Conclusions section. This report is an excellent pilot study but must be expanded and refined in order to formulate concrete recommendations to aid the industry...|$|R
