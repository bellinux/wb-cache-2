5|$|In ESRD, some {{eventually}} need hemodialysis {{or equivalent}} renal replacement therapy (RRT). If a <b>kidney</b> <b>transplant</b> is found {{for a patient}} on RRT, the disease will recur in the graft (transplanted kidney) in about 35% of cases, and in 11%, the graft will fail completely (requiring resumption of the RRT and a further transplant).|$|E
5|$|One {{danger of}} {{attempting}} to consume hallucinogenic or other wild mushrooms, especially for novice mushroom hunters, {{is the possibility of}} misidentification with toxic species. In one noted case, an otherwise healthy young Austrian man mistook the poisonous Cortinarius rubellus for P.semilanceata. As a result, he suffered end-stage renal failure, and required a <b>kidney</b> <b>transplant.</b> In another instance, a young man developed cardiac abnormalities similar to those seen in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, characterized by a sudden temporary weakening of the myocardium. A polymerase chain reaction-based test to specifically identity P.semilanceata was reported by Polish scientists in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Woodruff's {{contributions}} to surgery were important and long-lasting. In addition to performing the first <b>kidney</b> <b>transplant</b> in the UK, he devised {{a method of}} implanting a transplanted ureter in the bladder during transplants that is still used today. Furthermore, he established a large, efficient transplant unit in Edinburgh that {{remains one of the}} world's best. Although best known for these clinical accomplishments, Woodruff's {{contributions to}} the study of rejection and tolerance induction were equally important. Among these contributions, Woodruff's work with anti-lymphocyte serum has led to its wide use to reduce rejection symptoms in organ transplant recipients up to the current day.|$|E

However, it is {{discovered}} {{he was born with}} just one and will need a <b>kidney</b> <b>transplant.</b> None of his siblings are a tissue match, so Ash, Adi and Kareena visit their mother, but her kidney is not a match either. Tariq is forced to reveal that he is Dan's son, and he donates his kidney to Ronny. He explains that he thought having a mildly romantic relationship with his half sister would bring him closer to the family. Adi dislikes the fact he and Tariq are half brothers, but mellows towards him eventually. When bailiffs arrive to evict the family from their home, they board themselves into their living room, but eventually admit defeat and move into a flat with Sasha, starting a minicab firm called Toucan Cars.|$|E

He leaves shamed when they discover the kidney is needed for his other daughter Emily Alexander (Elizabeth Henstridge). William returns for the trial and she opens up to him. At the trial, Gilly and Jacqui remember the same events very differently. The jury find Gilly not guilty. Rhys tells Jacqui that he believes her and they agree to get married. However realising she is not over her ordeal Jacqui goes to stay with her dad in Spain. Upon her return she agrees to donate a kidney to Emily. When they are not a correct match, Emily tells her they were only interested in her kidney. Jacqui and Rhys marry but their relationship is problematic because Jacqui {{does not want to be}} intimate. Jacqui cannot readjust to life in the village. She gets a job working in The Dog. After more arguments Rhys suggests they spend time apart. Jacqui then goes missing, but is later found safe. She goes to see a counsellor and she and Rhys begin to rebuild their relationship.|$|E

However, Malachy is badly injured in an explosion and Mercedes is forced to turn off his life support, and he subsequently dies. Malachy's family are forced by Myra to invite Mercedes to his funeral despite discovering her infidelity. Mercedes gets into an argument with Billy Alexander (Richard Graham) at her aunt Kathleen McQueen's (Alison Burrows) fundraising event, after she accuses him of touching her. Carmel apologises for Mercedes' behaviour and agrees {{to have lunch with}} Billy. When Billy visits Carmel, Myra slaps him and reveals that he is the father of Mercedes and Jacqui. He tells Mercedes and Jacqui that he needs a <b>kidney</b> <b>transplant</b> and that they are the only likely donors. When Mercedes and Jacqui refuse to be donors, Kathleen tells Billy that he is the father of her daughter Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter), confirming that Theresa is actually Mercedes and Jacqui's half-sister. Billy is later revealed to not be needing a kidney, and that it is actually Mercedes, Jacqui and Theresa's secret half-sister, Emily Alexander (Elizabeth Henstridge). However, Mercedes is not interested in Billy nor Emily and declines to be a donor, although Jacqui later agrees to be a donor but is revealed not to be a match, so Billy and Emily disown her and leave.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Lexie works with Mercy West resident Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) on a burglar, and the two get in several disagreements, leading Lexie to steal her diary. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and Adamson continuously argue {{over the course of}} treatment for a patient, leading the patient's daughter to yell at them in disbelief. Angry about the revelation that Percy (who later apologized saying that they can be friends outside the hospital, but not inside) was using her, Stevens accidentally administers the wrong dialysis to a patient, making her an unviable candidate for the <b>kidney</b> <b>transplant</b> she was scheduled to receive. After arguing over surgical cases for the entirety of the day, Yang comes to the realization that she needs a cardiothoracic surgeon to work at the hospital. After being mistreated by Kepner, Lexie begins to mock her about what is written in her diary, thus ruining her emotionally, but subsequently apologizes. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Torres' girlfriend, talks to Carlos, and convinces him to accept his daughter's sexuality. Having found out about Stevens' mistake, Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) reprimands her reports her to the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.). Webber asks Stevens to come into her office, and he fires her from the staff, noting that Hunt, Shepherd, and Karev had concerns with her coming back to work so early. Stevens departs, writing Karev a Dear John letter, causing him to cry in front of Meredith and Yang.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction: Kidney {{transplantation}} {{is considered}} a cost-effective treatment compared to dialysis but accounts for {{a significant percentage of}} the public health care resources. Therefore, efficient systems capable of performing high number of procedures are attractive and sustainable. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate clinical outcomes of 11, 436 <b>kidney</b> <b>transplants</b> regularly performed in a single transplant dedicated center over the last 18 years. Methods: This was a retrospective study performed in a single specialized transplant center. All consecutive patients who underwent transplantation between 08 / 18 / 1998 and 12 / 31 / 2015 were included in the analysis. Results: The annual number of transplants increased from 394 in 1999 to 886 in 2015, with a progressive reduction in the proportion of living donor <b>kidney</b> <b>transplants</b> (70 % vs. 23 %) and yielding over 8869 patients in regular follow up. Of 11, 707 <b>kidney</b> <b>transplants</b> performed, 5348 (45. 7 %) were from living, 3614 (30. 9 %) standard and 1618 (13. 8 %) expanded criteria deceased donors, 856 (7. 3 %) pediatric and 271 (2. 3 %) simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplants. Comparing 1998 - 2002 and 2011 - 2014, five-years graft survival increased for <b>kidney</b> <b>transplants</b> performed with living donors (83. 3 % vs. 93. 1 %, p < 0. 001), standard deceased donors (60. 7 % vs. 79. 7 %, p < 0. 001), expanded criteria donors (46. 5 % vs. 71. 5 %, p < 0. 001) and for the pediatric population (79. 8 % vs. 80. 9 %, p = 0. 684). Conclusion: The implementation of a dynamic and efficacious health care system was associated with a progressive increase in the number of <b>kidney</b> <b>transplants,</b> in the cumulative number of patients in follow up and a shift from living related to deceased donor <b>kidney</b> <b>transplants,</b> with associated progressive increase in patient and graft survivals...|$|R

25|$|Some studies seem {{to suggest}} that the longer a patient is on {{dialysis}} before the transplant, the less time the kidney will last. It is not clear why this occurs, but it underscores the need for rapid referral to a transplant program. Ideally, a <b>kidney</b> <b>transplant</b> should be pre-emptive, i.e., take place before the patient begins dialysis. The reason why kidneys fail over time after transplantation has been elucidated in recent years. Apart from recurrence of the original kidney disease, also rejection (mainly antibody-mediated rejection) and progressive scarring (multifactorial) play a decisive role. Avoiding rejection by strict medication adherence is of utmost importance to avoid failure of the <b>kidney</b> <b>transplant.</b>|$|E
