5|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} material is one which changes shape when {{a magnetic field}} is applied. In reverse, it produces a magnetic field when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the {{magnetostrictive material}}. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a <b>d.c.</b> <b>current</b> superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.|$|E

40|$|The {{principle}} of transformation optics {{has been applied}} to various wave phenomena (e. g., optics, electromagnetics, acoustics and thermodynamics). Recently, metamaterial devices manipulating <b>dc</b> <b>currents</b> have received increasing attention which usually adopted the analogue of transformation optics using complicated resistor networks to mimic the inhomogeneous and anisotropic conductivities. We propose a distinct and general {{principle of}} manipulating <b>dc</b> <b>currents</b> by directly solving electric conduction equations, which only needs to utilize two layers of bulk natural materials. We experimentally demonstrate dc bilayer cloak and fan-shaped concentrator, derived from the generalized account for cloaking sensor.

25|$|The {{leakage current}} {{includes}} all weak imperfections of the dielectric caused by unwanted chemical processes and mechanical damage {{and is the}} <b>DC</b> <b>current</b> that can pass through the dielectric after applying a voltage in correct polarity. It depends on the capacitance value, on applied voltage and temperature of the capacitor, on measuring time, {{on the kind of}} electrolyte, and on preconditions like previous storage time without voltage applied or thermic stress from soldering. (All non-solid electrolytic capacitors needs a recovery time of some hours after soldering before measuring the leakage current. Non-solid chip capacitors need a recovery time after reflow soldering of about 24 hours.) Leakage current is reduced by applying operational voltage by self-healing processes.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} digital {{technologies}} like the microprocessor {{has provided the}} motivation to advance MOSFET technology faster than {{any other type of}} silicon-based transistor. A big advantage of MOSFETs for digital switching is that the oxide layer between the gate and the channel prevents <b>DC</b> <b>current</b> from flowing through the gate, further reducing power consumption and giving a very large input impedance. The insulating oxide between the gate and channel effectively isolates a MOSFET in one logic stage from earlier and later stages, which allows a single MOSFET output to drive a considerable number of MOSFET inputs. Bipolar transistor-based logic (such as TTL) does not have such a high fanout capacity. This isolation also makes it easier for the designers to ignore to some extent loading effects between logic stages independently. That extent is defined by the operating frequency: as frequencies increase, the input impedance of the MOSFETs decreases.|$|E

Concrete samples were prepared with different water/cement (w/c) ratio and silica fume (SF) content were submerged in distilled water for 30 days while subjected to a voltage of 50 V direct current (VDC). The effects <b>DC</b> stray <b>current</b> on the properties of concrete were determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and rapid chloride penetration (RCP) tests.
