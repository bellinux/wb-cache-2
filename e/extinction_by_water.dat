In this communication {{the effect of}} material porosity on re-ignition is investigated. A surrogate ceramic material is used so as to separate the pyrolysis and combustion processes from those associated with heat transfer. Experimental data are reported for different sample thickness and porosity, and varying heat flux and water application time...|$|E
40|$|The TSTC {{project is}} a multi-university {{collaborative}} effort to develop a high-fidelity turbulent reacting flow simulation capability utilizing terascale, massively parallel computer technology. The main paradigm of our approach is direct numerical simulation (DNS) featuring highest temporal and spatial accuracy, allowing quantitative observations of the fine-scale physics found in turbulent reacting flows {{as well as providing}} a useful tool for development of sub-models needed in device-level simulations. The code named S 3 D, developed and shared with Chen and coworkers at Sandia National Laboratories, has been enhanced with new numerical algorithms and physical models to provide predictive capabilities for spray dynamics, combustion, and pollutant formation processes in turbulent combustion. Major accomplishments include improved characteristic boundary conditions, fundamental studies of auto-ignition in turbulent stratified reactant mixtures, flame-wall interaction, and turbulent flame <b>extinction</b> <b>by</b> <b>water</b> spray. The overarching scientific issue in our recent investigations is to characterize criticality phenomena (ignition/extinction) in turbulent combustion, thereby developing unified criteria to identify ignition and extinction conditions. The computational development under TSTC has enabled the recent large-scale 3 D turbulent combustion simulations conducted at Sandia National Laboratories...|$|E
40|$|January 1 st 2015 new {{requirements}} regarding sulfur emission for ships {{entered into}} force. The new regulation concerns ships {{operating in the}} so called Sulfur Emission Control Area (SECA) that covers the Baltic Sea, North Sea and English Channel. The new regulations allow a maximum of 0. 10 weight percent sulfur in the fuel. Stricter regulations need to be met with new solutions for ship fueling. Today, heavy fuel oil (HFO) {{is the most common}} fuel in the maritime shipping. The frequently used HFO do not answer up to the new lower sulfur regulations and therefore the maritime shipping industry is trying to find alternative fuels for propulsion. One possible fuel is methanol. Compared to HFO, methanol poses a greater fire risk due to its low flashpoint. The regulation for maritime shipping on international waters, SOLAS, states that the flashpoint of fuels must exceed 60 ˚C; hence, methanol needs to be treated as an exception from these regulations. One way to reduce the fire hazard, in case of a spill, is to increase the flashpoint of methanol by water dilution. In order to handle low flashpoint fuels in a safe way, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) developed new regulations. The new regulations primarily focus on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and regulations for methanol is being developed under coordination of Sweden. However, the new adapted regulations do not cover active fire protection systems that are of great interest onboard ships. SP Fire Research is a partner {{in the work of the}} new regulations and one area that is of interest of being examined is dilution of methanol by water as a way to reduce the fire hazard. SP Fire Research has initiated a project around the issue of active fire protection systems and this study pursues to contribute to that work in terms of dilution of methanol. This study aims to determine the correlation between the flashpoint of methanol and the ratio of water diluted with the methanol. In order to determine this correlation literature studies have been made, tests for determination of the flashpoint of methanol water solutions performed and comparison with theoretical models and previous studies. Furthermore, there are comparisons between fire <b>extinction</b> <b>by</b> <b>water</b> mist and by water dilution. The results correlates well to previous performed studies regarding the dependence of the flashpoint on the degree of water dilution, and the main difference is the test methods that have been used. The test performed in this study was made due to standard EN ISO 3679 in an accredited laboratory. Furthermore, a comparison is made between extinction methods for methanol fires using water mist and dilution of methanol, respectively. The conclusions that could be drawn from this study are that there is a well-defined correlation between the flashpoint and the degree of dilution and that dilution of methanol might be a good way of reducing fire hazards and to extinguish methanol fires.

40|$|Water in the {{atmosphere}} is the principal natural impediment to propagation of both infra-red and near-millimeter wave electromagnetic energy. Attenuation <b>by</b> <b>water</b> in the vapor phase is greater near one millimeter than near 10 pm. When fog is present, <b>extinction</b> <b>by</b> the <b>water</b> or ice particles depends upon the wavelength of the propagating energy, the com-plex index of refraction of the particles for that wavelength, and the particle-size dis-tribution. This paper summarizes a thorough survey {{of the literature on}} fog drop-size dis-tributions throughout the world. A representative sample of data is selected for use in computations of the extinction of 10. 6, 870, and 1250 pm by numerous fogs. Attenuation by fog drops is much greater near 10 pm than near one millimeter. Computations made with German data show that attenuation of liquid plus vapor is smallest for 1250 pm in fogs of different densities in all seasons. In very dense German fogs, 10. 6 pm has the largest attenuation in all seasons. In spring, summer, and autumn attenuations of 10. 6 pm and 870 pm in moderate fogs are the same order of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|In {{ecosystems}} driven <b>by</b> <b>water</b> availability, {{plant community}} dynamics depend on complex interactions between vegetation, hydrology, and human water resources use. Along ephemeral rivers—where water availability is erratic—vegetation {{and people are}} particularly vulnerable to changes in each other 2 ̆ 7 s water use. Sensible management requires that water supply be maintained for people, while preserving ecosystem health. Meeting such requirements is challenging because of the unpredictable water availability. We applied information gap decision theory to an ecohydrological system model of the Kuiseb River environment in Namibia. Our aim was to identify the robustness of ecosystem and water management strategies to uncertainties in future flood regimes along ephemeral rivers. We evaluated the trade-offs between alternative performance criteria and their robustness to uncertainty to account for both (i) human demands for water supply and (ii) {{reducing the risk of}} species <b>extinction</b> caused <b>by</b> <b>water</b> mining. Increasing uncertainty of flood regime parameters reduced the performance under both objectives. Remarkably, the ecological objective (species coexistence) was more sensitive to uncertainty than the water supply objective. However, within each objective, the relative performance of different management strategies was insensitive to uncertainty. The ‘best’ management strategy was one that is tuned to the competitive species interactions in the Kuiseb environment. It regulates the biomass of the strongest competitor and, thus, at the same time decreases transpiration, thereby increasing groundwater storage and reducing pressure on less dominant species. This robust mutually acceptable strategy enables species persistence without markedly reducing the water supply for humans. This study emphasises the utility of ecohydrological models for resource management of water-controlled ecosystems. Although trade-offs were identified between alternative performance criteria and their robustness to uncertain future flood regimes, management strategies were identified that help to secure an ecologically sustainable water supply...|$|R
