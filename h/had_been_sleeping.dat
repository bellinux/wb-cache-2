5|$|After {{crossing}} the Rio Grande and arriving at Ojo de Agua at approximately 1am, the Mexican raiders attacked the village's garrison. The American soldiers who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sleeping</b> {{in a wooden}} building stubbornly resisted. The Americans were heavily outgunned, though, as the Signal Corps personnel were armed only with pistols. In the fighting Sergeant Schaeffer was killed, {{and as a result}} command devolved to Sergeant First Class Herbert Reeves Smith who by that time had also been wounded three times. In addition to attacking the garrison, the raiders robbed the post office and attacked the home of the Dillard family, setting their house on fire and stealing their livestock.|$|E

25|$|A 23-date tour {{in support}} of his third album, A Thousand Different Ways, began on July 4, 2007, and ended in Orlando, Florida, on August 19. On this tour Aiken hired local symphonies to back him, along with tour regulars Jesse Vargas, pianist, {{conductor}} and arranger; Sean McDaniel, drummer; and Quiana Parler and Angela Fisher, backup singers. Three days into the tour, Aiken and a woman were involved in an in-flight altercation in which she allegedly shoved him. As a result of the scuffle, Aiken and the woman were later questioned by the FBI. Aiken told ET that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sleeping</b> when the incident occurred.|$|E

After Joffrey is poisoned at his wedding by Margaery's grandmother, Olenna Tyrell, Cersei Lannister blames Tyrion for his death. Outraged at the kangaroo court presiding over his trial, Tyrion demands a trial by combat. Cersei chooses the Mountain as her champion and Oberyn offers to represent Tyrion. The trial {{ends in a}} victory for the Mountain and Tyrion is sentenced to death. Before he can be executed, Tyrion is freed by Jaime, who tells him Varys will smuggle him to the Free Cities. Tyrion, discovering that Shae <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sleeping</b> with Tywin, strangles her to death before killing Tywin and fleeing Westeros.|$|E

Hrothgar tells both Beowulf and Wiglaf, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sleeping</b> outside the hall during the attack, {{that it was the}} work of Grendel's mother. She is the last of the Water Demons, who were thought to have left the land. Beowulf and Wiglaf travel to the demon's cave to slay her. Beowulf enters the cave alone and {{encounters}} the demon, who {{takes the form of a}} beautiful woman. She offers to make him the greatest king who ever lived, in exchange for Hrothogar's drinking horn and a son, to replace Grendel.|$|E

25|$|In September 1997, Harkes {{prepared}} for the 1998 World Cup with an ill-advised trip to California that ultimately defined his legacy. In 2010, it was finally revealed by Eric Wynalda that former US national team manager Steve Sampson had cut Harkes from the 1998 World Cup team only two {{months prior to the}} tournament because Harkes <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sleeping</b> with teammate Eric's wife, Amy, in the couple's house, and near the playpen of their young child. Sampson became aware of the scandal and brewing feud between Wynalda and Harkes, and chose to cut Harkes to restore locker room accord. Despite intense criticism from the media and subsequent failure in the World Cup, Sampson remained silent regarding the true reason for Harkes' dismissal from the team out of respect for the privacy of those involved. Harkes himself would publish an autobiography in 1999 panning Sampson's tenure as manager, but made no mention of the affair.|$|E
25|$|He is briefly {{mentioned}} in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire where following the Death Eaters attack at the Quidditch World Cup, Mundungus {{put in an}} insurance claim to the Ministry of Magic for a twelve-bedroomed tent with an en-suite jacuzzi, while in reality he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sleeping</b> under a cloak propped on sticks. As a member of both the original and the newly reformed Order of the Phoenix, he is assigned guard duty to protect Harry, but abandons his position to conduct a shady cauldron-trading deal, leaving a critical opening through which Dementors manage to attack Harry. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Harry catches Mundungus outside the Three Broomsticks trying to sell what had been Sirius's property (which now belongs to Harry after Sirius's death) to Aberforth, and the boy confronts him. Mundungus goes into hiding but is later jailed in Azkaban for impersonating an Inferius during a botched robbery.|$|E
25|$|Hone {{arrived to}} the clinic in May 1992 {{following}} a stint in Guatemala and instantly clashed with several of the staff due to his unorthodox methods. Hone's fiancé Claire Lloyd (Annie Stanford) soon arrived but the couple broke up when it turned out she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sleeping</b> with both Chris Warner (Michael Galvin) and Michael McKenna (Paul Gittins). Hone grew close to co-worker Meredith Fleming's (Stephanie Wilkin) son Andrew (Ezra Woods) and became a father figure to him, eventually drawing him into a relationship with Meredith. In 1993 Meredith dumped Hone after several months and he flatted with Jenny (Maggie Harper) and Nick Harrison (Karl Burnett) and later, Chris Warner. Following an appearance on a current affairs show, Hone began to be harassed by an unseen assailant. Hone soon discovered it was a fellow doctor, Te Aniwa Ryan (Moana Maniapoto-Jackson) who disagreed with his medical views. Nonetheless, the two overcame their issues and became a couple. In 1994 Hone cheated on Te Aniwa with Hillary (Susan Brady), ending his relationship for an affair that was short lived.|$|E

500|$|The {{body was}} buried in a coffin and later {{translated}} to Beodericsworth, but Abbo failed to date either events, although from the text {{it can be seen}} that he believed that the relics had been taken to Beodericsworth by the time that Theodred became Bishop of London in around 926. Upon exhumation of the body, a miracle was discovered. All the arrow wounds upon Edmund's corpse had healed and his head was reattached. The only evidence of decapitation was a line around his neck and his skin was still soft and fresh, as if he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sleeping.</b> [...] The last recorded inspection of the body whilst at Bury St Edmunds was in 1198.|$|E

Gates felt Harvey wasn't getting the army to move fast enough on making necessary changes. Major General Eric Schoomaker was named the new commander of Walter Reed on March 2. [...] On the same day that Kiley was named, the Post reported that he had been aware of the issues at Walter Reed from his command in 2003, including the fact that a patient <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sleeping</b> in his own urine. [...] Kiley himself retired on March 12, 2007 after acting Army Secretary Pete Geren asked for Kiley's resignation.|$|E

2500|$|Judson's deist {{views were}} shaken when his friend Eames fell violently ill and died. Both <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sleeping</b> in {{separate}} rooms at an inn, and Judson heard the death throes {{of the person}} next door, only {{to learn from the}} clerk the next morning that his anonymous neighbor had been Mr. Eames, who had indeed died. The shock of learning the dying neighbor's identity – and that Eames had led Judson away from the Christian faith into skepticism, but was now dead – returned Judson back to the faith of his youth, although he was already attending the Andover Theological Seminary. In 1808, Judson [...] "made a solemn dedication of himself to God". During his final year at the school, Judson decided upon a missionary career.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the war, the annexed Polish territories {{were subject}} to German colonization. The goal of Germany was to {{assimilate}} the territories politically, culturally, socially, and economically into the German Reich. According to Esch, {{because of the lack}} of settlers from the Altreich, the colonists were primarily ethnic Germans from areas further East. [...] These ethnic Germans were resettled during colonisation action [...] "Heim ins Reich" [...] in homes from which the Poles had been expelled, often so abruptly that they found half-eaten meals on tables and unmade beds where small children <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sleeping</b> at the time of expulsion. [...] Members of Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls were assigned the task of overseeing such evictions to ensure that the Poles left behind most of their belongings for the use of the settlers.|$|E

Coffee testified that he had agreed to Celia's offer and taken the ashes and spread them {{along the side of the}} path, where he later witnessed the search party [...] "picking bones up out of the ashes." [...] In their cross-examination of Coffee Wainscott, the defense questioned him about his grandfather's sleeping arrangements on the night of his murder, much like they had questioned his mother, Virginia Wainscott. Coffee provided the defense with little information, other than the fact that his four-year-old brother, Billy, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sleeping</b> in the same room as their grandfather that night.|$|E

2500|$|Like many US universities, Duquesne University {{has faced}} {{criticism}} {{for what has}} been described as hire-and-fire treatment of academics not on tenure track. Adjunct faculty have complained that they are paid approximately $12,000 annually for full-time work without the right to receive or buy into benefits or healthcare, and with the risk of their anticipated work being terminated with as little as two weeks' notice. Following concern that any complaints to administrators could lead to adjunct professors being dismissed, adjunct faculty have sought to unionize by joining the United Steelworkers union. [...] Particular criticism was applied to the university after the death of Margaret Mary Vojtko, an adjunct who was removed by campus police from her office, where she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sleeping</b> as she could not afford to heat her house while paying for chemotherapy. On a contract that did not pay for insurance, her pay had recently been cut by approximately a third.|$|E
2500|$|Along the FSB perimeter, most of {{the troops}} took cover in their conex bunkers when the mortar barrage began. This allowed the sappers to close rapidly without any danger of return fire, {{and in many cases}} they were through the lines before the {{defenders}} moved from their bunkers to the sandbagged trench line. The first man to report seeing the sappers <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>sleeping</b> on top of his bunker, but didn't spot them until they were [...] "two-thirds of the way to the trench that connected the bunkers." [...] Many of 1-46th Inf's casualties occurred during this period and were concentrated among those units along the gently sloping side of the base. Charlie Company's First Platoon, occupying Bunkers 15-19 {{along the side of the}} perimeter that had a steep slope, was relatively untouched by the initial assault and manned their positions in the trench line. By contrast, Second Platoon in the southern sector had ten men killed and eleven wounded before Col Doyle and Capt Spilberg moved toward the Charlie Company CP.|$|E

[...] When Luca (still seething from being banned from his own casino) brutally rapes Pauli Taglia's girlfriend, a distraught Taglia turns against his boss and implicates Luca in the union leader's killing to Torello's Strike Force, just as Luca gets the ban on his license lifted. [...] Luca goes on trial for multiple murders, but cleverly orchestrates a mistrial by having Holman tamper with the jury and making sure the judge learns of it. [...] Luca is then released on bail pending a new trial. He apologizes to Pauli, who forgives him out of loyalty, though it is an agonizing decision since it means abandoning {{the one person who}} was genuinely decent towards him.|$|E
