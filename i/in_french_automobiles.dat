50|$|With {{help from}} the French banker Albert Oustric and Raoul Péret, the French Minister of Finance, SNIA Viscosa's shares were listed on the Paris {{exchange}} in 1926.Gualino became involved {{in a series of}} ventures with Ostric, often highly leveraged. The two financiers created Holding française and Holding italiana in 1928, and invested in car companies such as Peugeot and Ford, insurance, textiles, clothing, footwear and retail stores. They built an unstable structure with unsustainable debts. The partnership with Agnelli broke up due to Gualino's investments <b>in</b> the <b>French</b> <b>automobile</b> industry, and Gualino became isolated from the Italian business community.|$|R
40|$|This paper uses {{longitudinal}} data to perform tests of asymmetric information <b>in</b> the <b>French</b> <b>automobile</b> insurance {{market for the}} 1995 - 1997 period. This market {{is characterized by the}} presence of a regulated experience-rating scheme (bonusmalus). We demonstrate that the result of the test depends crucially on how the dynamic process between insurance claims and contract choice is modelled. We apply a Granger causality test controlling for the unobservables. We find evidence of moral hazard which we distinguish from adverse selection using a multivariate dynamic panel data model. Experience rating appears to lead high risk policyholders to choose contracts that involve less coverage over time. These policyholders respond to contract changes by increasing their unobservable efforts to reduce claims. ...|$|R
40|$|Asymmetric {{information}} {{is an important}} phenomenon in many markets and in particular in insurance markets. Testing for asymmetric information has become {{a very important issue}} in the literature in the last two decades. Almost all testing procedures that are used in empirical studies are parametric, which may yield misleading conclusions in the case of misspecification of either functional or distributional relationships among the variables of interest. Motivated by the literature on testing conditional independence, we propose a new nonparametric test for asymmetric information which is applicable in a variety of situations. We demonstrate the test works reasonably well through Monte Carlo simulations and apply it to an automobile insurance data set. Our empirical results consolidate Chiappori and Salanié’s (2000) findings that there is no evidence for the presence of asymmetric information <b>in</b> the <b>French</b> <b>automobile</b> insurance market...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of information problems in different markets is a challenging {{issue in the}} economic literature. This paper performs tests of asymmetric infor-mation <b>in</b> the <b>French</b> <b>automobile</b> insurance market for the 1995 - 1997 period. This market {{is characterized by the}} presence of a regulated experience-rating scheme (bonus-malus). Contract choices are strongly associated with the bonus-malus of policyholders. We have access to longitudinal survey data with dynamic infor-mation both on claims and accidents. We propose a causality test to distinguish pathways through which a positive correlation arises between contract choice and accidents. We find evidence of moral hazard among a sub-group of policyholders with significant driving experience (5 - 15 years). We distinguish this moral hazard estimate from adverse selection and learning. Policyholders with less experience have a combination of learning and moral hazard, whereas no residual information problem is found for policyholders with more than 15 years of experience...|$|R
50|$|During World War I (1914-18) Agnelli became {{involved}} with the financier Riccardo Gualino in transport of US aid to Europe in 1917.They invested in two enterprises in the United States; the Marine & Commerce Corporation of America exported coal and the International Shipbuilding Company made motorized vessels.These companies failed when the war ended, since they were structured to meet wartime demand, but had returned large profits to their owners.Agnelli and Gualino made an attempt early in 1918 to take over Credito Italiano.They did not succeed, but joined {{the board of directors}} of the bank.Agnelli was vice-president of Gualino's SNIA from 1917 to 1926. In the early 1920s SNIA began to manufacture artificial textile fibers.In 1920 Gualino and Agnelli participated in recapitalization of the private bank Jean de Fernex, and bought a third of the shares of Alfredo Frassati, publisher of La Stampa.Gualino and Agnelli were also involved in a proposal to link Milan, Genoa and Turin with a high-speed railway, and in various projects in cement and automobiles.Their partnership broke up around 1926 due to Gualino's investments <b>in</b> the <b>French</b> <b>automobile</b> industry.|$|R
