50|$|The {{dekatron}} {{was useful}} for computing, calculating and <b>frequency-dividing</b> purposes because one complete {{revolution of the}} neon dot in a dekatron means 10 pulses on the guide electrode(s), and a signal {{can be derived from}} one of the ten cathodes in a dekatron to send a pulse, possibly for another counting stage. Dekatrons usually have a maximum input frequency in the high kilohertz (kHz) range - 100 kHz is fast, 1 MHz is around the maximum possible. These frequencies are obtained in hydrogen-filled fast dekatrons. Dekatrons filled with inert gas are inherently more stable and have a longer life, but their counting frequency is limited to 10 kHz (1-2 kHz is more common).|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{is part of}} a conceptual study of multi-user OFDM systems, parts of which previously has been presented at the ETSI STC SMG 2 meetings no 18 and 19. This part proposes and explains in detail methods for the estimation of time and frequency offsets of pulse-shaped OFDM signals. In particular, focus is on the uplink of time- and <b>frequency-divided</b> systems. Synchronization in such context is accomplished by remote-adjusting the clocks and oscillators of the mobiles to those of the base station. For this purpose, the estimation of the respective time and frequency offsets of each mobile at the base station is crucial. For OFDM systems employing a guard space and pulse shaping this paper presents methods for obtaining these estimates. The performance of the estimators is discussed in terms of error variance, and results for some of the channel characteristics specified by ETSI are presented...|$|R
30|$|The WFC/OFA, {{including}} the WPT-S and MSC-S sensors and their preamplifiers, has an onboard calibration function that measures the frequency responses of sensors and receivers {{by applying the}} standard signals generated by the known signal source. The onboard calibration system is {{used to examine the}} degradation of sensors and receivers. The signal source we use is the main clock (16.777216  MHz) of the WFC/OFA digital parts and is divided by the FPGA. The divided signal is fed to both the WPT-Pre input and the calibration coil wound inside of the MSC (Ozaki et al. 2018). As the waveform of the calibration signal is rectangular, it consists of odd harmonics, and the waveform covers the wide frequency range. The fundamental frequency of the rectangular waveform can be altered by changing the <b>frequency-dividing</b> rate, which in turn can change by telemetry commands.|$|E

The desired system characteristic can be prescribed by a (complex) acoustic transfer function rather than an electrical one only.

40|$|Instantaneous Neighbors Estimation (FINE) system {{specifically}} designed for density estimation in Dedicated Short Range Com-munication (DSRC) based vehicular networks. A large amount of vehicular applications such as navigation, traffic control, and data dissemination substantially rely on the density information. Recent works pay great attention to obtain the real-time density information and reduce the occupation time of DSRC channel. The state-of-the-art approach is the Framed Slotted ALOHA (FSA) framework, which benefits from its fine-grained time division design. However, FSA considers only time resource and is unaware of the frequency resource in DSRC. For further accel-erating the density acquisition, we propose a <b>frequency-divided</b> approach. The core idea of FINE is to resort fine-grained channel division for parallel neighbors counting. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate FINE. The results demonstrate that FINE significantly outperforms existing methods. In a typical dense scenario, FINE reduces the time cost from 2 ms (FSA) to 50 µs, while maintains the accuracy {{at the same level}} as FSA. I...|$|R
40|$|Chikayoshi Sumi, Yousuke IshiiDepartment of Information and Communication Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, Sophia University, Tokyo, JapanAbstract: The {{development}} of effective ultrasonic tissue displacement measurement methods increases {{the number of}} possible applications for various tissue displacement and strain measurements. These applications include measurements of spontaneous motions/deformations generated by heart motion; pulsations from phenomena such as blood flow (intracardiac, intravascular, and carotid); heart, blood vessel, and liver motion; and motion from artificial sources such as motions/deformations generated by applying static compression/stretching forces, vibration or acoustic radiation forces (breast and liver). For arbitrary orthogonal coordinate systems obtained using arbitrary transducer types (eg, linear, convex, sector, arc, or radial array types, or single aperture types with a mechanical scan), several lateral modulation (LM) methods (eg, scanning with plural crossed or steered beams over a region of interest) have been developed {{that can be used}} with new echo imaging methods for tissue displacement/deformation measurements. Specifically, by using such beamforming methods, in addition to highly accurate displacement vector and lateral displacement measurements, LM echo imaging with a high lateral carrier frequency and a high lateral resolution has been developed. Another new beamforming method, referred to as &ldquo;a steering angle (ASTA) method,&rdquo; ie, scanning with a defined steering angle, is also described. In addition to conventional non-steered-beam scanning (ie, a version of ASTA) and conventional steered-beam scanning with a variable steering angle (eg, sector, arc, radial scan), a simple, single-beam scanning method also permits the use of LM, which yields an accurate displacement vector measurement with fewer calculations than the original LM methods. This is accomplished by using a previously developed spectra frequency division method (SFDM). However, the lateral carrier frequency and the measurement accuracy acquired by using such a single-beam scanning method are lower than those achieved with the original LM scanning methods and should be increased (ie, by using a quasi-LM method). In this report, the effectiveness of the use of the new SFDMs is verified with experiments on agar phantoms, in which conventional non-steered, focused single-beam transmission/reception scanning is performed together with high-speed non-steered single plane-wave transmission and non-steered, focused single-beam reception scanning using a linear array-type transducer. For comparison, the original LMs, with their respective transmissions of crossed, steered focused beams and plane waves are also performed. Because the use of rectangular apodization functions (ie, no apodization) yields a larger bandwidth in a lateral direction than the effective use of parabolic functions with the original LM method, it is shown that disregarding the lateral low-frequency spectra yields useful quasi-LM echo imaging with a high lateral frequency, and further significantly increases the measurement accuracy of a displacement vector. In addition, when no apodization is used with the original version of LM, disregarding the low-frequency lateral spectra is effective. In addition, the interchangeability of cosine and sine modulations performed after completing beamforming can also be used for single-beam scanning {{as well as for the}} original LM scanning method. Specifically, the cosine and sine modulations, respectively, are used for LM and quasi-LM imaging and displacement vector measurements. It is concluded that the appropriate use of the new SFDMs with simple single-beam scanning or with simple plural crossed-beam scanning with no apodization can achieve almost the same accuracy as the original LM scanning method using plural crossed beams with the effective apodization. Another new application of SFDM is also described: an incoherent superposition of the <b>frequency-divided</b> spectra reduces speckles. The new methods will also be effective for other beamforming methods and with other types of transducers.
