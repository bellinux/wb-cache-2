Ashdown's spokesman, Julian Braithwaite, noted the report's publication just before elections in the Republika Srpska: [...] "The question for the RS government is why are they publishing this report now, {{at the time when}} it could be easily interpreted as irresponsible electioneering.

The parole officer eventually called the Concord police. Upon the arrival of a police sergeant, Garrido admitted he had kidnapped and raped her. Only after this did Dugard identify herself as Jaycee Dugard. It was later suggested that Dugard was beginning to show signs of Stockholm syndrome. In a 2016 interview with Diane Sawyer of ABC News, Dugard stated that her compassion and willingness to interact with her captor were only means of surviving. Dugard: [...] "The phrase [...] implies that hostages cracked by terror and abuse become affectionate towards their captors." [...] "Well it's, really, it's degrading, you know, having my family believe that I was in love with this captor and wanted to stay with him.

It is contrary to the nature of faith (I mean the holy and true faith), because faith embraces love, fear of God, and reverence, which abhor such carnal and gross eating, as much as any one would shrink from eating his beloved son.… We believe that the true body of Christ is eaten in the communion in a sacramental and spiritual manner by the religious, believing, and pious heart (as also St. Chrysostom taught).

2500|$|In 1858 Grigory Kushelyov-Bezborodko {{published}} the first Maykov anthology Poems by Ap. Maykov. In 1879 it was expanded and re-issued by Vladimir Meshchersky. The Complete Maykov {{came out in}} 1884 (its second edition following in 1893). In the 1880s Maykov's poetry was dominated by religious and nationalistic themes and ideas. According to I. Yampolsky, {{only a few of}} his later poems ("Emshan", [...] "The Spring", 1881) had 'undisputable artistic quality'. In his later years the poet wrote almost nothing new, engaging mostly in editing his earlier work and preparing them for compilations and anthologies. [...] "Maykov lived the quiet, radiant life of an artist, evidently not belonging to our times... his path was smooth and full of light. No strife, no passions, no persecution," [...] wrote Dmitry Merezhkovsky in 1908. Although this generalization was <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> according to biographer F.

2500|$|Most Western {{observers}} {{believed that}} Khrushchev {{had become the}} supreme leader of the Soviet Union by the early 1960s, even if this was <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> The Presidium, which had grown to resent Khrushchev's leadership style and feared Mao Zedong's one-man dominance and the growing cult of personality in the People's Republic of China, began an aggressive campaign against Khrushchev in 1963. This campaign culminated in 1964 with the replacement of Khrushchev in his offices of First Secretary by Leonid Brezhnev and of Chairman of the Council of Ministers by Alexei Kosygin. Brezhnev and Kosygin, along with Mikhail Suslov, Andrei Kirilenko and Anastas Mikoyan (replaced in 1965 by Nikolai Podgorny), were elected to their respective offices to form and lead a functioning collective leadership. One {{of the reasons for}} Khrushchev's ousting, as Suslov told him, was his violation of collective leadership. With Khrushchev's removal, collective leadership was again praised by the Soviet media, and it was claimed to be a return to [...] "Leninist norms of Party life". At the plenum which ousted Khrushchev, the Central Committee forbade any single individual to hold the office of General Secretary and Premier simultaneously.|$|E
2500|$|Several historians {{take the}} middle ground between condemning reparations and {{supporting}} the argument {{that they were not}} a complete burden upon Germany. Detlev Peukert states, [...] "Reparations did not, in fact, bleed the German economy" [...] as had been feared, however the [...] "psychological effects of reparations were extremely serious, as was the strain that the vicious circle of credits and reparations placed the international financial system". P.M.H. Bell writes that while reparations were unwelcome in Germany and caused a [...] "strain on the German balance of payments", they could be paid and were [...] "compatible with a general recovery in European commerce and industry". According to Martel, Robert Boyce said reparations were [...] "a heavy burden on Germany, both as a financial charge...and as a charge on Germany's balance of payments". However, he says that while [...] "Germany claimed it could not afford to pay reparations" [...] this was <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> and that [...] "...Germany had made little effort to pay reparations. It refused to levy the necessary taxes, and far from accumulating the foreign exchange required for their payment by collecting some of the overseas earnings of German exporters, it allowed them to leave their earnings abroad". William R. Keylor agrees with Boyce, and says, [...] "an increase in taxation and reduction in consumption in the Weimar Republic would have yielded the requisite export surplus to generate the foreign exchange needed to service the reparation debt". However, Charles Feinstein writes that these kind of arguments overlook the extreme reluctance of the Germans [...] "to accept even a modest increase in taxation to meet what was universally regarded as an unjustified and oppressive imposition by hostile adversaries". Feinstein says that [...] "even if the economic aspects...were not as crippling as had been assumed in the 1920s, the exaction of reparations was still of deep political and psychological significance for Germany".|$|E
