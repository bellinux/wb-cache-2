5|$|By 1919, the {{influence}} of Chinese Civil War had spread to Sarawak when <b>Kuomintang</b> set up its first branches in Sibu and Kuching. Charles Brooke opposed such political activity by the local Chinese and had expelled several local <b>Kuomintang</b> leaders. However, Charles Vyner Brooke was more receptive of such activities by local Chinese. The local Chinese also participated in a donation drive to aid <b>Kuomintang</b> in its fight against Japanese invasion on China mainland. After World War II ended, local <b>Kuomintang</b> leaders supported the cessation of Sarawak to British as Crown Colony but the local communist leaders were against it. Clashes between the communist and the <b>Kuomintang</b> supporters were common. The <b>Kuomintang</b> branches in Sarawak were finally dissolved in 1949 when the party lost a war on China mainland to the Communist party and retreated to Taiwan. However, clashes between the both sides continued until 1955 when Kuomintang's newspaper was banned by the colonial British government in May 1951; while Communist's newspapar ceased to exist in 1955 due to financial difficulties.|$|E
5|$|After the 1937 Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China and Japan {{formally}} went to war. When the <b>Kuomintang</b> and Communist Party {{declared a}} united front to fight the Japanese, Peng was confirmed as a general in the unified command structure of the NRA. At the August 20, 1937 Lochuan Conference(洛川会议), Mao believed that the united front should {{be used as a}} feint, giving token resistance to the Japanese while saving the strength of the Red Army for the eventual confrontation with the <b>Kuomintang,</b> but Peng, along with most other senior military and political leaders at the time, disagreed, and believed that the Red Army should genuinely focus on fighting the Japanese. Mao was not able to force his position, and the communists cooperated with the <b>Kuomintang</b> and fought the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Tang Shengzhi aligned {{himself with}} {{northern}} warlords against the warlord controlling Guangdong, who was {{aligned with the}} <b>Kuomintang.</b> Peng conducted skirmishes along the Hunan-Guangdong border for nine months, but reorganized his battalion along pro-Kuomintang political lines in 1925. In late 1925 Chiang Kai-shek established the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) and led the <b>Kuomintang</b> {{to take control of}} Guangdong. Tang then aligned himself with Chiang and joined him in the Northern Expedition, an effort to unify China by defeating the northern warlords. The Hunanese army was reorganized, and Peng was promoted to the rank of major. When Wu Peifu invaded Hunan and occupied Changsha, Chiang sent the NRA to Hunan, beginning the Northern Expedition. Peng's forces then joined the <b>Kuomintang,</b> though Peng never joined the party as a formal member. It wasn't until after Peng joined the <b>Kuomintang,</b> in 1925, that he first heard of the Communist Party.|$|E
5000|$|The Jinan {{incident}} (Wade-Giles: Tsinan Incident, 済南事件) or May 3 Tragedy (...) , was {{an armed}} {{conflict between the}} Japanese Army allied with Northern Chinese warlords against the <b>Kuomintang's</b> southern army in Jinan, the capital of Shandong in 1928 during the <b>Kuomintang's</b> Northern Expedition.|$|R

5|$|Peng staged {{his first}} {{offensive}} after becoming Defense Minister in January 1955, when he attacked and occupied {{a chain of}} islands, part of Zhejiang, which were still held by the <b>Kuomintang,</b> from which the Nationalists occasionally staged guerrilla raids as far as Shanghai. This operation led the United States to form a defense agreement with Taiwan, effectively preventing the communists from completely defeating the <b>Kuomintang.</b>|$|E
5|$|An ardent {{supporter}} of the <b>Kuomintang,</b> Lee was involved in secret meetings with Sun Yat-Sen at the Wan Qing Yuan, a two-storey villa at Tai Gin Road. He also helped the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia raise funds to support the <b>Kuomintang</b> in their struggles against the Empire of Japan and Communist Party of China. In 1937, Lee and five other Chinese community leaders bought the Wan Qing Yuan to preserve it as a historical site; it was later {{handed over to the}} Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI), which renovated it {{and turned it into a}} national monument, the Sun Yat Sen Villa (now Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall).|$|E
5|$|As the Chinese Civil War was raging at {{the time}} and Communist forces were attacking river boats {{travelling}} from Chongqing, it was judged necessary to transport the pig bristles from the city by air. The <b>Kuomintang</b> government agreed to allow RAAF and Royal Air Force aircraft to fly return flights between Hong Kong and Chongqing between 1 and 14 May only. After arriving in Hong Kong, the bristles would be shipped to Australia by sea. Both the <b>Kuomintang</b> government and the Communist forces were concerned about the presence of foreigners in China, and the Australian aircrew were warned that they would be imprisoned if they landed anywhere other than Chongqing or an emergency airstrip at Canton.|$|E

5|$|Between 1941 and 1946, Harrison was the ship's {{doctor on}} board the Demodocus, a steam liner {{ferrying}} supplies to Allied forces across the Indian Ocean. After the war, Harrison wanted to assist the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), but had to falsify his records by subtracting seven years off his age to qualify for service. During this time, he served in China delivering much-needed supplies to a country devastated by the long Second Sino-Japanese War and once even saved the lives of 90students by sheltering them from a <b>Kuomintang</b> officer. By donning an American army officer's uniform, Harrison was able to convince the <b>Kuomintang</b> officer to not check a barge which held the students hidden inside.|$|E
5|$|Between July 1926 and March 1927 Peng campaigned in Hunan, {{participating}} in the capture of Changsha and Wuhan. Under general Ho Chien(何键), Peng participated in the Battle of Fengtai, in which <b>Kuomintang</b> forces decisively defeated the warlord Wu Peifu. In 1927, Wang Jingwei attempted to establish a left-leaning <b>Kuomintang</b> government in Wuhan that threatened Chiang Kai-shek's leadership. Tang Shengzhi, who Peng served under, aligned himself with Wang, and Peng was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and regimental commander. After Tang's forces were decisively defeated by Chiang, Peng commanded the rear guard, protecting the retreat of Tang's forces back into Hunan.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, {{following}} {{the collapse of}} the First United Front, <b>Kuomintang</b> authorities ordered Zhu to lead a force against Zhou Enlai and Liu Bocheng's Nanchang Uprising. Having helped orchestrate the uprising, Zhu and his army defected from the <b>Kuomintang.</b> The uprising failed to gather support, however, and Zhu was forced to flee Nanchang with his army. Under the false name of Wang Kai, Zhu managed to find shelter for his remaining forces by joining warlord Fan Shisheng. He was soon named head of a new First United Front military institute in Nanchang.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Kuomintang's</b> {{economic}} and military campaign against merchants continued for many years. Chiang also enforced an anti-Japanese boycott, sending agents to sack the shops of those who sold Japanese-made items, fining them.|$|R

25|$|Under the new ROC {{president}} Lee Teng-hui, the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion was renounced in May 1991, thus {{ending the}} chances of the <b>Kuomintang's</b> conquest to retake the mainland.|$|R
5|$|In 1929 Zhu and Mao {{were forced}} to flee Jinggangshan to Ruijin {{following}} <b>Kuomintang</b> military pressure. Here they formed the Jiangxi Soviet, which would eventually grow to cover some 30,000 square kilometers (11,584 square miles) and include some three million people. In 1931 Zhu was appointed leader of the Red Army in Ruijin by the CPC leadership. He successfully led a conventional military force against the <b>Kuomintang</b> in the lead-up to the Fourth Counter Encirclement Campaign; However, {{he was not able}} to do the same during the Fifth Counter Encirclement Campaign and the CPC fled. Zhu helped form the 1934 break-out that began the Long March.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 the <b>Kuomintang</b> {{displayed}} a massive {{photo of the}} anti-Japanese Aboriginal leader Mona Rudao at its headquarters {{in honor of the}} 60th anniversary of Taiwan's handover from Japan to the Republic of China.|$|E
5|$|In many districts Taiwanese aborigines tend to {{vote for}} the <b>Kuomintang,</b> {{to the point that the}} {{legislative}} seats allocated to the aborigines are popularly described as iron votes for the pan-blue coalition. This may seem surprising in light of the focus of the pan-green coalition on promoting aboriginal culture as part of the Taiwanese nationalist discourse against the KMT. However, this voting pattern can be explained on economic grounds, and as part of an inter-ethnic power struggle waged in the electorate. Some aborigines see the rhetoric of Taiwan nationalism as favoring the majority Hoklo speakers rather than themselves. Aboriginal areas also tend to be poor and their economic vitality tied to the entrenched patronage networks established by the <b>Kuomintang</b> over the course of its fifty-five year reign.|$|E
50|$|The Soong-Chang ticket {{appeared}} {{first on}} the ballot, followed by the <b>Kuomintang's</b> Lien and Siew, then two independent tickets, Li-Fung and Hsu-Chu. The eventual winning Democratic Progressive Party ticket of Chen and Lu were listed fifth.|$|R
5000|$|Yang Hucheng {{joined the}} Xinhai Revolution {{in his youth}} and had become a popular warlord of Shaanxi Province by 1926. Following the defeat of Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan in the Central Plains War of 1930, Yang allied himself with the <b>Kuomintang's</b> Republic of China {{government}} becoming commander of the <b>Kuomintang's</b> Northwest Army. Ordered to destroy the newly established Communist Party of China (CPC) stronghold at Yan'an with Zhang Xueliang's Northeast Army in 1935, both Yang and Zhang Xueliang were impressed with the Communists' determined defense and fighting capabilities. They were convinced by the Communist proposal for a united Chinese defense against the Japanese invasion of China.|$|R
50|$|After {{returning}} to Shanghai, Deng discovered {{that his wife}} and daughter had died during childbirth. In addition, he discovered that many of his former comrades had {{died as a result of}} the <b>Kuomintang's</b> crackdown against the Communists.|$|R
5|$|Japanese rule of Taiwan {{ended in}} 1945, {{following}} the armistice with the allies on September 2 {{and the subsequent}} appropriation of the island by the Chinese Nationalist Party (<b>Kuomintang,</b> or KMT) on October 25. In 1949, on losing the Chinese Civil War to the Communist Party of China, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek led the <b>Kuomintang</b> in a retreat from Mainland China, withdrawing its government and 1.3 million refugees to Taiwan. The KMT installed an authoritarian form of government and shortly thereafter inaugurated a number of political socialization programs aimed at nationalizing Taiwanese people as citizens of a Chinese nation and eradicating Japanese influence. The KMT pursued highly centralized political and cultural policies rooted in the party's decades-long history of fighting warlordism in China and opposing competing concepts of a loose federation following {{the demise of the}} imperial Qing. The project was designed to create a strong national Chinese cultural identity (as defined by the state) at the expense of local cultures. Following the February 28 Incident, the <b>Kuomintang</b> placed Taiwan under martial law, which was to last for nearly four decades.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, 1949, the People's Liberation Army entered Qingdao {{and both}} the city and Shandong Province have since been under Communist control. Bishop Tien fled to Taiwan with the <b>Kuomintang</b> government.|$|E
5|$|After a {{temporary}} period {{of research at}} the London School of Economics in England, Chen was appointed the Deputy Secretary-General of the Presidential Office in February 2007.

Chen served with Lin Chia-lung, former director of the Government Information Office.|$|E
50|$|He {{served as}} Minister of Justice in the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) {{administration}} from 2000 until January 31, 2005. In late 2005, he campaigned for the Yilan County magistrate election but {{was defeated by}} the <b>Kuomintang's</b> Lu Kuo-hua.|$|R

5000|$|Formosa Magazine (...) was a {{magazine}} created by Tangwai individuals in Taiwan {{during the summer}} of 1979. It opposed the <b>Kuomintang's</b> political monopoly in the Republic of China government. A police raid of the Formosa Press caused the Kaohsiung Incident in December 1979.|$|R
5|$|Chai {{was elected}} a {{legislator}} representing Chiayi City in 1992.

During these terms, Chai {{was involved in the}} National Defense, Overseas Compatriot Affairs, and Foreign Affairs Committees.|$|E
5|$|Part of the {{collection}} was returned {{at the end of}} World War II, but the other part was evacuated to Taiwan in 1948 under orders by Chiang Kai-shek, whose <b>Kuomintang</b> was losing the Chinese Civil War. This relatively small but high quality collection was kept in storage until 1965, when it again became public, as the core of the National Palace Museum in Taipei.|$|E
5|$|Peng {{remained}} behind to guard Jinggangshan {{with a force}} of 800 soldiers, but withdrew from the area when it was attacked by a Hunanese <b>Kuomintang</b> force of 25,000 soldiers, joining Zhu and Mao in Ruijin in March. Although he had saved his force from destruction, he was criticized by Mao for withdrawing. Peng returned to Jinggangshan with a force of 1,000 men later that year, occupying the area after the <b>Kuomintang</b> withdrew. In mid-1929 Peng's forces merged with the forces of two local bandit groups, but conflicts arose over supplies and the command structure, and the two groups rebelled against Peng in July 1929. One of the bandit leaders was captured and executed by Peng, and the other committed suicide. The remaining forces were incorporated into Peng's unit, bringing its strength up to 2,000 men. Peng then organized a series of increasingly ambitious raids into southern Hunan throughout 1929 and 1930, capturing an increasing amount of supplies and attracting more recruits.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Kuomintang's</b> purge of the Whampoa Military Academy cadet corps {{took place}} {{three days after}} the anti-communist {{massacre}} in Shanghai.
