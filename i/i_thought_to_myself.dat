25|$|One day for {{the march}} I {{received}} this heavy old gun. A gun? And during a war? Never, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself.</b> And leaned it against a hut. And walked away. But that stood out even in our group at that time. I don't know now how I got away with it, but somehow it worked. And so I got by unarmed.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} sessions {{served as}} the first production credit for Scott-Heron, Jackson, and Jose Williams. As the third unofficial collaboration between Scott-Heron and Jackson, the album's recording featured more of Jackson's input than before. Jackson recounted the experience in an interview for All About Jazz, stating [...] "He had this way with words and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'People have to hear this stuff'. What I had to offer was the music and I figured if we can take his words and make this tribal knowledge rhythmic and musical, we can draw people to hear it." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 23, Feldman threw seven {{scoreless}} innings {{while allowing}} only four hits in {{a win over}} the Tampa Bay Rays. It was his 13th win of the season (tied for third in the AL) and put his season record at 13–4. It was Feldman's ninth road win of the season (bringing him to 9–1 on the road), tying him with Sabathia for best in the AL. The win put the Rangers two games ahead of the Rays in the AL wild card standings, and one game behind the Red Sox. [...] His career-high 11 strikeouts were the most by a Ranger since Matt Perisho struck out 12 in 1999 (see [...] ). [...] Commenting on Feldman's last strikeout, Carlos Peña said: [...] "I was on second base, and I saw a pitch that he made to B. J. , and I was like, 'Wow.' <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'That's unhittable right there.'" [...] Rays manager Joe Maddon called Feldman's performance [...] "the best-pitched game against us all year", in spite of Mark Buehrle's perfect game against them earlier in the season.|$|E

2500|$|He is also, {{alongside}} Brendan Nelson, {{one of two}} federal Liberal leaders {{never to}} lead the party into an election. On opposition leadership, he said in 2008 that: [...] "The moment when I wanted to [...] was just about the first day I started in the job.

But I stayed four and a half years." [...] Foss did not discuss details, but others close to Gould said he was convinced someone was trying to poison him and that others were spying on him.|$|E

60|$|He {{had done}} worse than listen, as <b>I</b> privately <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself.</b> He had remembered my {{telling him that}} the girl {{was in love with}} Mr. Franklin; and he had {{calculated}} on THAT, when he appealed to Mr. Franklin's interest in Rosanna--in Rosanna's hearing.|$|R
60|$|I told him, smiling, that {{no doubt}} I {{could have found}} a ship much nearer my native place, but <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> that if <b>I</b> {{was to be a}} seaman then I would be a British seaman and no other. It was a matter of {{deliberate}} choice.|$|R

2500|$|I was {{influenced}} so greatly by {{a television show}} in igniting the passion that I had as being a prosecutor, and it was Perry Mason … In one of the episodes, {{at the end of}} the episode … Perry said to the prosecutor, [...] "It must cause you some pain having expended all that effort in your case to have the charges dismissed." [...] And the prosecutor looked up and said, [...] "No. My job as a prosecutor is do justice and justice is served when a guilty man is convicted and when an innocent man is not."

2500|$|Francis {{was from}} his {{experiences}} suspicious {{and set up}} an extensive network of police spies and censors to monitor dissent (in this he was following his father's lead, as the Grand Duchy of Tuscany had the most effective secret police in Europe). [...] Even his family did not escape attention. [...] His brothers, the Archdukes Charles and Johann had their meetings and activities spied upon. [...] Censorship was also prevalent. [...] The author Franz Grillparzer, a Habsburg patriot, had one play suppressed solely as a [...] "precautionary" [...] measure. [...] When Grillparzer met the censor responsible, he asked him what was objectionable about the work. [...] The censor replied, [...] "Oh, nothing at all.

2500|$|Gubby's single {{attempt to}} {{participate}} in a Formula One World Championship race, the 1965 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, also ended with problems in practice. At the Woodcote corner, his Lotus jumped out of sixth gear at 170mph, and Gubby was forced to hold the gear lever in position whilst cornering at high speeds. He decided there and then to retire from the sport, and did not attend the following day's practice session. He later recalled, [...] "I was driving on a shoestring, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Brian, you've got a family to look after and you'll end up killing yourself'." [...] He had entered the 1965 Mediterranean Grand Prix, but withdrew his entry and sold his Lotus to Stirling Moss for use by a film company working with Steve McQueen.|$|E
2500|$|Kamo later {{discussed}} his experiences at feigning insanity {{for over three}} years: [...] "What can I tell you? [...] They threw me about, hit me over the legs and the like. [...] One of the men forced me {{to look into the}} mirror. [...] There I saw − not the reflection of myself, but rather of some thin, ape-like man, gruesome and horrible looking, grinding his teeth. [...] <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Maybe I've really gone mad!' It was a terrible moment, but I regained my bearings and spat upon the mirror. [...] You know I think they liked that....I thought a great deal:'Will I survive or will I really go mad?' That was not good. [...] I did not have faith in myself, see?..., of course, know their business, their science. [...] But they do not know the Caucasians. [...] Maybe every Caucasian is insane, as far as they are concerned. [...] Well, who will drive whom mad? [...] Nothing developed. [...] They stuck to their guns and I to mine. [...] In Tiflis, they didn't torture me. [...] Apparently they thought that the Germans can make no mistakes." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "God Only Knows" [...] is {{frequently}} cited for referencing [...] "God" [...] in its title, {{a decision that}} Wilson and Asher agonized over, fearing it would not get airplay as a result. As Wilson's then-wife Marilyn describes, [...] "The first time I heard it, Brian played it {{for me at the}} piano. And I went, 'Oh my God, he's talking about God in a record.' It was pretty daring to me. And it was another time <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Oh, boy, he's really taking a chance.' I thought it was almost too religious. Too square. At that time. Yes, it was so great that he would say it and not be intimidated by what anybody else would think of the words or what he meant." [...] Asher explains that he and Brian [...] "had lengthy conversations during the writing of 'God Only Knows', because unless you were Kate Smith and you were singing 'God Bless America', no one thought you could say 'God' in a song. No one had done it, and Brian didn't want to be the first person to try it. He said, 'We'll just never get any air play.' Isn't it amazing that we thought that? But it worked." [...] Wilson added that although he feared putting the word [...] "God" [...] in the title of the song, he eventually agreed to keep it, firstly, [...] "because God was a spiritual word", and secondly, because the Beach Boys would [...] "be breaking ground".|$|E
