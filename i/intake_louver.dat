40|$|Practical and {{accurate}} technologies {{are needed for}} continuously measuring and controlling outdoor air (OA) intake rates in commercial building heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. This project evaluated two new measurement approaches. Laboratory experiments determined that OA flow rates were measurable with errors generally less than 10 percent using electronic air velocity probes installed between OA <b>intake</b> <b>louver</b> blades or at the outlet face of louvers. High accuracy was maintained with OA flow rates as low as 15 percent of the maximum for the louvers. Thus, with this measurement approach HVAC systems do not need separate OA intakes for minimum OA supply. System calibration parameters are required for each unique combination of louver type and velocity sensor location but calibrations are not necessary for each system installation. The research also determined that the accuracy of measuring OA flow rates with velocity probes located in the duct downstream of the <b>intake</b> <b>louver</b> was not improved by installing honeycomb airflow straighteners upstream of the probes. Errors varied with type of upstream louver, were as high as 100 percent, and were often greater than 25 percent. In conclusion, use of electronic air velocity probes between the blades of OA intake louvers or at the outlet face of louvers is a highly promising means of accurately measuring rates of OA flow into HVAC systems. The use of electronic velocity probes downstream of airflow straighteners is less promising, at least with the relatively small OA HVAC inlet systems employed in this research...|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} to control outdoor airflow rates into HVAC systems in terms of energy conservation and healthy indoor environment. Technologies are being developed to measure outdoor air (OA) flow rates through OA intake louvers on a real time basis. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the airflow characteristics through an OA <b>intake</b> <b>louver</b> numerically in order to provide suggestions for sensor installations. Airflow patterns are simulated with and without electronic air velocity sensors within cylindrical probes installed between louver blades or at the downstream face of the louver. Numerical results show quite good agreements with experimental data, and provide insights regarding measurement system design. The simulations indicate that velocity profiles are more spatially uniform at the louver outlet relative to between louver blades, that pressure drops imposed by the sensor bars are smaller with sensor bars at the louver outlet, and that placement of the sensor bars between louver blades substantially increases air velocities inside the louver. These findings suggest there is an advantage to placing the sensor bars at the louver outlet face...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) {{simulations}} {{are carried}} out to select a better air intake system for a new fire laboratory, designed for experiments with a maximum fire heat release rate of 7 MW. Two different air intake systems are considered: a louver system around the lower perimeter of the building or a chimney system that employs vertical ducts to bring fresh air down from the roof to {{the lower part of}} the building. The two systems are investigated with different fire sizes and wind speeds. The results show that the chimney system gives a more stable smoke and temperature stratification inside the building and a higher hot smoke layer above the floor. The louver system, on the other hand, gives rise to unsymmetrical air movements inside the building when the wind speed outside is high. The louver system also yields a lower hot smoke layer that can spill smoke through the louvers to the outside of the building, especially for small fires with low exhaust flow rates. The results, therefore, suggest that an evenly distributed chimney system would provide a more stable ventilation environment for conducting fire experiments and would prevent smoke leakage to the outside of the building.

Atmospheric ice accretion occurs, when super cooled water droplets {{come into contact with}} the exposed surface of a structure in cold regions like arctic and alpine. Most investigations of this subject have been performed using experimental techniques, but for {{the last decade or so}} the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based numerical techniques have begun to play a significant role in understanding and simulating the atmospheric ice accretion on structures.

40|$|A 1 : 6 scale {{physical}} model and a computational {{model of a}} Tracy Fish Collection Facility (TFCF) primary bypass <b>intake</b> with approach <b>louvers</b> were studied to refine bypass approach velocity distributions. The TFCF functions to prevent fish entrainment at the Tracy Pumping Plant. The TFCF collects fish that are {{then returned to the}} Delta. To achieve efficient fish collection, velocity fields should be generated that are uniform and that supply well directed guidance to the bypass entrance. In the first phase of this study, modeling was used to develop low maintenance internal features of the bypass entrance that generated near-uniform internal velocity distributions (Kubitschek 2003). This second phase study focused on extending the 1 : 3 model findings to the approach flow. Study findings show that velocity distributions {{in the vicinity of the}} bypass entrance are influenced by approach flow velocity distributions. This may imply that the TFCF trashracks and louvers should be maintained clean to sustain uniform velocity fields approaching and entering the intakes. Findings also show that by adding a minor flow restriction to the backside of the louver immediately adjacent to the bypass entrances, a local through louver high velocity zone can be eliminated which should improve fish guidance to the bypass intake. Finally, findings show that acceptable passing flow and bypass entrance hydraulics can be maintained with the bypass guide wall removed. This supports possible future guide wall removal that could lead to application of improved louver cleaning techniques (i. e., eliminate the need for removal of the louver panels during cleaning) ...|$|R
