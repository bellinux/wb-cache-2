50|$|From the 1950s on, {{under the}} {{directorship}} of Ernst Binder, {{the company was}} {{able to carry out}} the entire manufacturing process from raw material to finished items of jewellery in house. As a result of its direct contacts to the wholesale trade, the company {{was in a position to}} cater for the requirements and wishes of its customers by providing faster delivery of market-oriented products. As the 1960s dawned, the third generation of Klaus and Fritz Binder were among the first to react to the emerging trend towards the <b>globalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets.</b> With the ambitions expansion of a high-tech production facility, the company was ready to meet the challenge of global entrepreneurship and become a leading edge corporation which today operates over a thousand specialised machines.|$|E
40|$|<b>Globalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets</b> is a {{phenomenon}} that receives much attention and is extensively debated both at general societal/institutional/cultural levels and at market and business levels. In any globalization process, distribution {{of goods and services}} between and within local industrial and consumer markets is obviously of crucial importance. <b>Globalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets</b> and reorganization of distribution are mutually dependent processes and involve changes in market structures. Contemporary examples of this are the emergence of global supply chains, internationalization of wholesale, retail and transportation firms and the development of sales via the internet. These dynamic aspects of distribution imply reorganisation of firms and relationships between firms (including strategic alliances and mergers) involved in distribution activities. This paper will discuss the nature of the interdependence between <b>globalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets</b> and the reorganisation of distribution applying a network view of markets and with reference to cultural dimensions. Some broad issues for further research aimed at understanding globalisation, will be addressed from the network perspective...|$|E

40|$|Process The <b>globalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets</b> {{influences}} {{the supply chain}} of enterprises: improved options for global sourcing have consequences on cost structures {{and the importance of}} an early integration of suppliers in the development process. In a case study, we derived an approach for meeting the challenge of globalisation and benefiting from the enhanced sourcing options. The proposed procedure model describes three alternative procedures in the product development process. Depending on the component complexity and a first cost prognosis, the model assists in the choice of an activity pattern. Thus, an early purchase decision is supported that facilitates a cost-efficient design by the integration of in-house or external manufacturing experts. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the rich}} and complex history of China, Western culture (in Umberto Eco’s sense) has been a {{significant}} reference point and trigger for China’s extensive and often painful national self-reflection, in which the tensions between traditional Chinese values and Western cultural paradigms (or "the alien other") determined the radical repositioning of the Chinese cultural self. China’s preoccupation with Western culture (Modernism) peaked in the 1920 s and 1930 s and again in the 1980 s in Deng Xiaoping’s ambitious vision of a new national identity, which resulted in the <b>globalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>market</b> and cultural life. While China’s economic success has attracted considerable interest in the West, the social and cultural problems resulting from it domestically require wise and courageous solutions since the hope that globalisation will ensure equity, justice and democracy in China and in the world at large is identified by some scholars as utopian (Wang Hui) or a "fairy tale" (Naomi Klein). The proposed paper attempts to elucidate the impact <b>of</b> <b>globalisation</b> on China’s cultural and intellectual life, identifying potential dangers of cultural dislocation and loss of cultural identity. Attention will also be given to recent research, in which China’s globalisation agenda is questioned...|$|R

Major changes in general cargo trades {{are seen as}} being {{beyond the control of}} individual shipping lines and ports, and, in fact, beyond the control of national governments.
