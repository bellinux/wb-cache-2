The final solidification point is of high importance for applying soft reduction during continuous casting {{in order to ensure}} inner quality and achieve high productivity. The measurement was conducted at one of the casters at SSAB Oxelösund, of which all the support rolls are separately mounted. The project finds that this method shows promising results and can help to narrow down the range of the location due to certain interferences and noises. The <b>ferrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> decrease during tail-out and the variation of whether a pressure drop exists is the dividing line of full and partial solidification.

40|$|A finite-element model, CON 2 D, {{has been}} {{developed}} to simulate temperature, shape, stress, and hot-tear crack development during the continuous casting of steel, both in and below the mold. The stress model features an elastic-viscoplastic creep constitutive equation that accounts for the different responses of the liquid, semi-solid, delta-ferrite, and austenite phases. Temperature and composition-dependent functions are also employed for properties such as thermal linear expansion. A contact algorithm prevents penetration of the shell into the mold wall due to the internal liquid <b>ferrostatic</b> <b>pressure.</b> An efficient two-step algorithm {{has been developed}} to integrate these highly non-linear equations.

40|$|Key words: {{continuous}} casting; round bloom; minimum mould exit {{shell thickness}}; foot roller designing Abstract: The minimum mould exit shell thickness (MEST) {{is one of}} key factors to consider for continuous casting machine design. Based on the shell strength at elevated temperatures, a concept of shell integral average strength, from its very top surface to the solidus frontier, has been introduced to judge its bulging tendency under <b>ferrostatic</b> <b>pressure.</b> Considering the contribution for the foot roller designing, a mathematic model for {{the determination of the}} minimum MEST has been brought forward. It is shown that, when the minimal foot roll pitch is fixed, the minimum MEST is steady. But at the same time, when the MEST does not exceed the minimum value, the round bloom off-round would happen, it is worse for the round bloom than the bulging for the normal strand. And there is the cross point with the curve of the minimum MEST by the minimum roll pitch and the minimum MEST by the fluting include angle of the support roller and the lateral support roller against the cross section...|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional finite-element thermal-stress {{models are}} applied to predict temperature, {{distortion}} and residual stress in a continuous casting mold for steel slabs. The model predictions of temperature, distortion during operation, and residual distorted mold shape match plant observations. During operation, the copper faces bend towards the steel, with a maximum outward distortion {{on the order of}} 1 mm, found just above the center of the wide faces. Distortion during operation increases with increasing mold temperature, increasing strand width, and decreasing water jacket rigidity. Mold clamping forces, bolt prestress, friction, and <b>ferrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> have little effect on this behavior. Constraint generated by the temperature gradients and the sides of the bolt holes in the steel water jackets generate stresses and creep in the copper hot face during operation. This leads to permanent distortion and residual stress after cooling to ambient. Residual stress and distortion increase with repeated thermal cycling over a campaign, higher temperatures, smaller water-jacket bolt holes, non-uniform water slot depth, and higher clamping forces. Increased residual distortion requires increased remachining, which reduces mold life. Increased residual stress increases the probability of a catastrophic crack failure. 1...|$|E
40|$|Surface and {{internal}} quality of continuous casts depends {{very much on}} the behaviour of the strand in the mould. Among the parameters likely to influence this behaviour, the mould taper takes a prominen tpart. In order to understand better the influence of this parameter, we build up a thermal-mechanical finite element model. A slice of the strand is modelled and its evolution is observed. The main results are temperature field and solidification evolution, stree, strain and strain rate fields and losses of contact and returns to contact analysis.

In the present work, worn bricks from different zones in the ladle have been analysed, {{and a set of}} interdependent degradation mechanisms is proposed. Refractory wear as a function of position in the ladle is discussed. Slag infiltration and MgO dissolution from the refractory were observed in all samples, whereas FeOx decomposition was seen at two levels in the high wear samples. First, partial decomposition of primary chromite crystals ((Mg) [Fe 3 +, Cr, Al](2) O- 4) occurred at the hot face of the brick. Three layers were distinguished in the reacted chromite crystals and a reaction mechanism is presented. Second, a decrease in the FeOx content of the magnesia phase occurred at the hot face of the brick. The negative effect of the presence of FeOx in magnesia-chromite refractories is discussed and the influence of the <b>ferrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> is demonstrated.

40|$|The {{explicit}} {{finite element}} method is applied in this work to simulate the coupled and highly non-linear thermo-mechanical phenomena that occur during steel solidification in continuous casting processes. Variable mass scaling is used to efficiently model these processes in their natural time scale using a Lagrangian formulation. An efficient and robust local–global viscoplastic integration scheme (Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng 2006; 66 : 1955 – 1989) to solve the highly temperature- and rate-dependent elastic– viscoplastic constitutive equations of solidifying steel has been implemented into the commercial software ABAQUS/Explicit (ABAQUS User Manuals v 6. 7. Simulia Inc., 2007) using a VUMAT subroutine. The model is first verified with a known semi-analytical solution from Weiner and Boley (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 1963; 11 : 145 – 154). It is then applied to simulate temperature and stress development in solidifying shell sections in continuous casting molds using realistic temperature-dependent properties and including the effects of <b>ferrostatic</b> <b>pressure,</b> narrow face taper, and mechanical contact.

40|$|The {{formation}} of longitudinal off-corner depressions or “gutters ” in continuous-cast steel slabs {{has been investigated}} using coupled finite-element models. Thermal-mechanical behavior of the solidifying shell has been simulated as it moves down through the mold and upper support rolls in the spray chamber. The calculation includes solidification, intermittent gap formation, plastic creep, bulging due to <b>ferrostatic</b> <b>pressure,</b> interaction with the mold and rolls, and phase transformations. The effects of turbulent flow in the liquid pool, flow and melting of the powder layers, superheat dissipation, taper, and thermal distortion of the mold walls are accounted for using separate models. Together, these models illustrate a multi-stage mechanism for gutter formation. The problem starts with a hot, thin region down the off-corner wide face. This {{may be caused by}} locally-inadequate liquid powder feeding, or by insufficient taper of the upper portion of the narrow face mold walls, allowing corner rotation within the mold. Depressions may then be created by excessive taper, buckling the thin shell near mold exit. Alternatively, they may evolve during bulging between support rolls below the mold, due to bending of the thin off-corner region. The results suggest that the problem can be avoided by optimizing the mold flow pattern and powder properties to obtai...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} a {{numerical}} model based on the finite element method applied to the continuous casting of steel. The model is developed using the LAGAMINE finite element code and two industrial applications of steel casting are presented to illustrate {{the capabilities of the}} model. The first chapter introduces the continuous casting process, defining the essential terminology and the industrial challenges. Then, the objectives of the model are detailed: the model is applied to {{the upper part of the}} caster (in the mould region) as well as to the bending and straightening zones. Chapters two, three and four are dedicated to the theoretical developments of thermal aspects (phase transformations, thermal contraction, heat flow and thermal boundary conditions), mechanical aspects (generalized plain strain state, material constitutive law, <b>ferrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> and mechanical contact) and the staggered analysis used for thermal / mechanical coupling. In the two next chapters, some numerical results are presented. The model has been first applied to a 125 mm square billet in the mould region. The industrial goal is to evaluate the effect of the mould taper on the cooling of the billet (temperature evolution, solid shell growing, stress and strain development). The second application focuses on the risk of transverse cracking during straightening of steel slabs and the effect of some local defects (reduction of secondary cooling, locking or misalignment of rolls). The thesis ends with some concluding remarks and perspectives for the model...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been done over the years and has contributed quite a lot to the development of 3 CR 12 stainless steel. Nevertheless, there is still much to be understood about the behaviour of this steel during its production. One of the problems that are occasionally encountered is the side bulging effect i. e. the unconstrained narrow faces of the strand plastically bulge due to <b>ferrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> from the liquid core of the strand at high temperatures. In general, this problem is prevalent in ferritic stainless steels as they exhibit a weaker hot strength than austenitic stainless steels. Coupled with side bulging, there is also strand width variation at high temperatures i. e. when the steel is in the ferrite-austenite dual phase region. Both of these dimensional changes to the slab profile create some processing problems in subsequent hot rolling operations when unacceptable width variations are encountered. This work was, therefore, motivated by the requirement to quantify the role that the metallurgical behaviour of this steel plays with regard to the above width variation problem. The research work involved studies of the d -ferrite to austenite phase change during continuous cooling (simulating cooling during continuous casting) and the establishment of CCT diagrams, the influence of chemical composition on the austenite start temperature and the hot ductility and hot strength visà-vis the side bulging effect. The casting conditions in the mould are crucial to ensure that the solidification shell is thick enough to withstand the <b>ferrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> exerted on the unconstrained narrow sides of the strand as it exits from the mould. Therefore, part of the solution lies {{in the study of the}} optimisation of the cooling rate, mould flux properties, casting speed, mould taper angle and the chemical composition of this steel, among other factors. Additions of austenite formers, within the specification range of 3 CR 12, should be favourable for a stronger solidification shell since austenite exhibits superior hot strength to d -ferrite. The good hot ductility observed in 3 CR 12 may also provide a leeway for increasing the secondary cooling rate in order to form a thicker solidification shell soon after emerging from the mould. This may reduce the side bulging effect. This can be achieved without a risk of transverse cracking if the cooling is adjusted carefully. As long as the d -ferrite to austenite phase ratio keeps fluctuating due to variations in (i) the chemical composition within the specification range and (ii) the cooling rate in the dual phase region from cast to cast, the strand width variation effect will persist. This is simply because of the effect these have on the ferrite to austenite phase ratios through the differences between the lattice structures of these two phases. Ferrite being less dense than austenite, occupies more volume than austenite, thereby affecting the slab width. The remedy to this problem is to control within stricter chemical composition limits in order to reduce or completely avert this width variation effect.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} in the mold {{is the heart}} of the continuous casting process and its quantitative analysis was pioneered by Keith Brimacombe. With many different processes currently competing, it is appropriate to apply modeling to investigate the theoretical limits of continuous casting speed and productivity. The heat transfer rate during solidification processes drops with time so the shell thickness at mold exit drops with increasing casting speed. A computational heat flow model similar to those of Brimacombe is applied to investigate the consequences of very high casting speed on shell thickness at mold exit. Next, a finite-element stress model is applied to predict the minimum shell thickness at mold exit that should have sufficient strength to avoid rupture due to longitudinal tearing of the weak shell under the forces of <b>ferrostatic</b> <b>pressure.</b> The critical shell thickness is predicted to be on the order of 3 mm for most grades and casting conditions. The models are then applied to predict maximum casting speeds for different steel grades, section sizes, and mold lengths. The theoretical limits to casting speed are predicted to be extremely high, exceeding 21 m/min for a conventional 800 -mm long, 200 -mm square bloom mold, which corresponds to 3. 5 million tonnes per year. The infeasibility of these high limits in practice is due to other problems, such as achieving shell thickness uniformity and liquid flux lubrication. This work suggests that if shortening mold length can solve lubrication, taper, and other problems, then it should be explored as a potential means to increase productivity...|$|E
40|$|The mold {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components of the continuous casting machine since the mold controls the shape and initial solidification of the steel product, where quality is either created or lost. During casting, the mold is submitted to heat flux from liquid steel on one side whereas the other side is water cooled, leading to the generation of large temperature gradients. It is also submitted to other stresses such as <b>ferrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> and clamping forces. Casting can last several dozens of hours whereas the cooling step of the mold, when liquid steel is not poured anymore into the mold, can last only a few minutes. Maintaining a reliable, crack-free mold within close dimensional tolerances is crucial to safety and productivity. In order to withdraw the right amount of heat and to prevent mold distortion, mold is generally made of copper alloys that have the thermal and mechanical properties required for this function. The two copper alloys most widely used for casting mold are Cu-Ag and Cu-Cr-Zr. They present a wide range of thermal and mechanical properties due to the different treatments to which they can be submitted. The present master thesis aims to study the influence of thermomechanical properties of copper alloys on continuous casting mold behavior during casting and cooling, and more precisely on mold for continuous casting of steel slabs using realistic finite element models of heat transfer and stress. After realizing a literature review of the most widely used copper alloys, three finite elements models were developed in order to study the influence of three copper alloy grades on mold thermomechanical behavior. The three finite elements models were a 2 D simplistic transverse section of the mold model, a 2 D transverse section of the mold model that includes bolts and the backup plate and a 3 D quarter mold model. Simulations of casting and cooling step were performed with ABAQUS 6. 10 ® for the two most widely used copper alloys and a copper alloy that was previously submitted to a heat treatment. Simulations results show that the two copper alloys most widely used lead to similar mold behavior. Besides, the material submitted to a heat treatment does not lead to a critical behavior but can lead to a necessity of more frequent re-machining of the mold...|$|E
40|$|Primary cooling &ndash; {{inside the}} tundish &ndash; {{has a great}} impact over the {{thickness}} of the solidified steel crust. If on exiting the tundish the crust is too thin, it can punch and break, {{as a result of the}} <b>ferrostatic</b> <b>pressure</b> exerted from the inside by the liquid steel as well as because of the weight of the molten steel. The parameters that influence the amount of dissipated heat depend on the cooling water flow of the tundish, on the pressure and temperature of the cooling water but also on the overheating of the continuously cast steel. The secondary cooling takes place at the exit of the semi-finished product from the tundish, when the solidification is supposed to take place all along the cross section of the strand. In order to achieve it, in addition to a correctly managed primary cooling, it is necessary to obtain the proper correlation of the factors that influence the secondary cooling as well: the water flow rate long the three zones of the installation and its pressure in the secondary circuit. All these have in view a proper solidification length; an intense cooling can generate cracks due to the thermal stress, while a too slow cooling can generate a partial solidification of the strand up to the cropping machine area. The paper presents a mathematical simulation of the continuously cast steel solidification.

40|$|The {{continuous}} casting technique {{in the last}} four decades has been large used for to production of semi-finished steel. The heat transfer is major mechanism and it occurs in various steps during the {{continuous casting}}. The quality of steel {{is directly related to the}} way the heat transfer occur because the thermal variations produce mechanical loads as well as contact forces which are generated through the rollers and shake of the mold. Such factors may cause defects such as fractures or cracks in the final product if the resulting stresses and strains exceed critical values. The technique must be improved in order to reduce the appearance of defects and the production time. For this a good understanding of physical phenomena involved during the solidification process is critical.
