40|$|Conditional <b>indicatives</b> {{are words}} or short phrases that {{facilitate}} comprehension and signal {{relationships among the}} clauses and sentences comprising an argument. Causal <b>indicatives</b> (e. g. because, since and thanks to) imply {{a positive relationship between}} two clauses such that the acceptance of one makes the other more likely to be true, whereas contrary <b>indicatives</b> (e. g. yet, even though and but) suggest a negative relationship between two clauses such that accepting one makes the other less plausible. A laboratory experiment compared the effects of contrary <b>indicatives,</b> causal <b>indicatives</b> and neutral connectives (e. g. and, also and in addition) on the comprehension and acceptance of advertising claims. The results indicated that, compared to neutral connectives, conditional <b>indicatives</b> had little or no impact when they were consistent with message recipients' expectations. However, causal <b>indicatives</b> had a negative effect on comprehension and acceptance when they ran counter to prior beliefs about product attributes. 12 page(s...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{characterize}} {{the performance of}} students from the 5 th year of primary school, with and without <b>indicatives</b> of reading and writing disorders, in receptive vocabulary and reading comprehension of sentences and texts, and to verify possible correlations between both. METHODS: This study {{was approved by the}} Research Ethics Committee of the institution (no. 098 / 13). Fifty-two students in the 5 th year from primary school, with and without <b>indicatives</b> of reading and writing disorders, and from two public schools participated in this study. After signing the informed consent and having a speech therapy assessment for the application of inclusion criteria, the students were submitted to a specific test for standardized evaluation of receptive vocabulary and reading comprehension. The data were studied using statistical analysis through the Kruskal-Wallis test, analysis of variance techniques, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient with level of significance to be 0. 05. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (was constructed in which reading comprehension was considered as gold standard. RESULTS: The students without <b>indicatives</b> of reading and writing disorders presented a better performance in all tests. No significant correlation was found between the tests that evaluated reading comprehension in either group. A correlation was found between reading comprehension of texts and receptive vocabulary in the group without <b>indicatives.</b> CONCLUSION: In the absence of <b>indicatives</b> of reading and writing disorders, the presence of a good range of vocabulary highly contributes to a proficient reading comprehension of texts...|$|R

5|$|Along with {{pressure}} tendency, {{the condition of}} the sky {{is one of the more}} important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is <b>indicative</b> of rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds that prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front. Cloud-free skies are <b>indicative</b> of fair weather for the near future. A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.|$|E

On the basis of a sample of 100 languages, we conclude that imperatival strategies are limited to imperatives, subjunctives, and <b>indicatives</b> while prohibitival strategies range from negative subjunctives and negative auxiliary constructions through constructions with prohibitive markers and negative infinitives to negative <b>indicatives</b> and negative imperatives. Politeness is shown {{to play an important role}} in the development of new strategies, which often have a more polite character and which become neutral themselves over time. We argue that it may even partly explain why prohibitival strategies exhibit more variation than imperatival ones. However, it is also clear that new directive strategies need not be more polite and that politeness is just one of the possible factors contributing to the difference between imperatival and prohibitival strategies...|$|R

Logographs belonging to the third principle, phono-semantic compound characters (xíngshēng 形聲), are implicitly identified through the entry pattern A… from B, phonetically resembles C (A...從 B, C 聲), meaning that element B plays a semantic role in A, while C gives the sound. The fourth type, compound <b>indicatives</b> (huìyì 會意), are sometimes identified by the pattern A...from X from Y (A...從 X 從 Y), meaning that the compound A is given meaning through the graphic combination and interaction of both constituent elements. The last two of the six principles, borrowed characters (aka phonetic loan, jiǎjiè 假借) and derived characters (zhuǎnzhù 轉注), are not identifiable in the character definitions.|$|R
