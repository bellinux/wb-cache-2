5|$|Jeff Hardy {{is the son}} of Gilbert and Ruby Moore Hardy, and {{the younger}} brother of Matt Hardy. Their mother died of brain cancer in 1986, when Hardy was nine. He {{developed}} an interest in motocross aged 12 and got his first bike, a Yamaha YZ-80, at age 13. He had his first race when he was in ninth grade. Hardy played baseball as a child, but had to stop after he crashed during a motocross race, injuring his arm. He also played football during high school as a fullback and linebacker. He briefly competed in amateur wrestling in high school. He had to stop playing football in high school, after he was ordered to pick between professional wrestling and football, and he chose wrestling. Hardy's favorite subjects in school were U.S. history and art, which he did for <b>extra</b> <b>credit.</b>|$|E

25|$|A bill {{signed into}} law in September 2014, {{mandated}} the CARB to draft a financial plan to meet California's goal of putting one million vehicles on the road while making sure that disadvantaged communities can participate. CARB had to change the Clean Vehicle Rebate program to provide an <b>extra</b> <b>credit</b> for low-income drivers who wish to purchase or lease an electric car. CARB also provides assistance to carsharing programs in low-income neighborhoods and install charging stations in apartment buildings in those communities. Under bill SB 1275, low-income residents who agree to scrap older, polluting cars will also get a clean vehicle rebate on top of existing payments for junking smog-producing vehicles.|$|E

50|$|<b>Extra</b> <b>Credits</b> has had {{a sister}} channel called Extra Play since December 14, 2014, {{but it did not}} become active until October 2015, when Side Quest, a Let's Play series of Dark Souls with Floyd and Portnow, was moved from the main channel to Extra Play. The purpose of this channel is to provide a place for the team to post more casual, less-scripted videos that wouldn't fit on <b>Extra</b> <b>Credits.</b> Besides Side Quest, the channel runs several other let's play series. In Guest Play, Floyd brings in people who also work in the gaming {{industry}} to discuss design elements in video games, which often features other members of the <b>Extra</b> <b>Credits</b> team. Floyd also started an unnamed series of videos discussing animation in video games, which has since been named Extra Frames and moved to <b>Extra</b> <b>Credits</b> as of May 5, 2016. Portnow has started Destiny Whaaat? and Tea & Hearthstone. He discusses questionable design choices in Destiny in the former and analyzes aspects of Hearthstone in the latter. Dan Jones, one of the artists of <b>Extra</b> <b>Credits</b> has started a Pokémon Nuzlocke Challenge of Pokémon Diamond.|$|R
25|$|In late 2007, CAFE {{standards}} {{received their}} first overhaul {{in more than}} 30 years through the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), and were set to rise to 35 mpg by the year 2020. However, in May 2009 the Obama Administration announced a new harmonized national policy that will require an average fuel economy standard of 35.5 mpg in 2016. The flex-fuel CAFE credits are scheduled to end in 2016, but because the 2007 EISA made CAFE credits exchangeable between different classes of automobiles and tradable between companies, and also carmakers are allowed to carry over credits {{for up to five}} years, the flex-fuel credits accumulated up to 2016 can be carried over and traded until 2020. The CAFE standards proposed in 2011 for the period 2017-2025 will allow flexible-fuel vehicles to receive <b>extra</b> <b>credit</b> but only when the carmakers present data proving how much E85 such vehicles have actually consumed.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} {{proved to}} be rather troubled, with five different directors helming different segments of the film and with stunt co-ordinator Richard Talmadge co-directing the final sequence. In addition to the credited writers, Woody Allen, Peter Sellers, Val Guest, Ben Hecht, Joseph Heller, Terry Southern, and Billy Wilder are all believed to {{have contributed to the}} screenplay to varying degrees. Val Guest was given the responsibility of splicing the various [...] "chapters" [...] together, and was offered the unique title of [...] "Co-ordinating Director" [...] but declined, claiming the chaotic plot would not reflect well on him if he were so credited. His <b>extra</b> <b>credit</b> was labelled [...] "Additional Sequences" [...] instead.|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics have}} argued that American {{automakers}} have been producing E85 flex models motivated by a loophole in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements, that allows for a fuel economy credit for every flex-fuel vehicle sold, whether or not in practice these vehicles are fueled with E85. This loophole might allow the car industry to meet the CAFE targets in fuel economy just by spending between [...] and [...] that it cost to turn a conventional vehicle into a flex-fuel, without investing in new technology to improve fuel economy, and saving them the potential fines for not achieving that standard in a given model year. The CAFE standards proposed in 2011 for the period 2017-2025 will allow flexible-fuel vehicles to receive <b>extra</b> <b>credit</b> but only when the carmakers present data proving how much E85 such vehicles have actually consumed.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the end of}} July 2011, {{there was}} a dispute between The Escapist and the team that {{provided}} content for the show <b>Extra</b> <b>Credits.</b> After not being paid for months, the <b>Extra</b> <b>Credits</b> team needed to pay for surgery for their artist, Allison Theus. They began a charity fund, separate from The Escapist, and received substantially more money than was necessary for Theus's surgery. They planned to use this extra money to create a game publishing label, where the revenue would go directly into funding subsequent projects. The Escapist stated the money should {{have been used to}} create more episodes of <b>Extra</b> <b>Credits</b> for The Escapist and to compensate Themis Media for donation incentives, such as premium memberships and T-shirts. As a result, <b>Extra</b> <b>Credits</b> broke ties with The Escapist, and the show has since aired on Penny Arcade, ScrewAttack and has its own channel on YouTube.|$|R

[...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, Christgau said protest songs in general are [...] "hard to nail even in the moment" [...] and felt {{that some of the}} album's songs [...] "just don't twist the screw tight enough", but quipped, [...] "I give [...] <b>extra</b> <b>credit</b> for both preaching to the converted and doing his damnedest to rally the holier-than-thou." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an eighth-grade {{commencement}} address entitled “Humanity's Next Great Adventure,” {{given at}} a school in San Mateo, California, in 2002, Clancey recalled his own school years, when he “always got <b>extra</b> <b>credit</b> in eighth grade science, answering quiz questions about the latest Gemini two-person launches, getting us ready for the {{first trip to the}} moon in three years. I used to read these stories in the New York Times--absorbing every word. And of course when Star Trek began on TV in September, I watched the first episode and haven't missed any in 36 years.

2500|$|Florida State (11–1, ACC Champions) {{was chosen}} to play undefeated Oklahoma (12–0, Big 12 champions) in the Orange Bowl for the {{national}} championship, despite their one loss coming to another one-loss team, the Miami Hurricanes (10–1, Big East champions), who were ranked No. 2 in both human polls. Adding to the controversy, Miami's one loss came to yet another one loss team, the Pac-10 champion Washington Huskies, leaving three teams with a legitimate claim to play Oklahoma in the National Championship game. [...] Florida State lost to Oklahoma 13–2, while Washington and Miami both easily won their BCS games, adding more fuel to the fire. As {{a result of the}} controversy, the BCS was tweaked in the off-season: a [...] "quality-win" [...] bonus was added to the formula, giving <b>extra</b> <b>credit</b> for beating a top ten team.|$|E
2500|$|A {{report from}} the Federal Reserve Bank of New York {{concluded}} that, [...] "We ... test whether payday lending fits our definition of predatory. We find that in states with higher payday loan limits, less educated households and households with uncertain income {{are less likely to}} be denied credit, but are not more likely to miss a debt payment. Absent higher delinquency, the <b>extra</b> <b>credit</b> from payday lenders does not fit our definition of predatory." [...] The caveat to this is that with a term of under 30 days there are no payments, and the lender is more than willing to roll the loan over at the end of the period upon payment of another fee. [...] The report goes on to note that payday loans are extremely expensive, and borrowers who take a payday loan are at a disadvantage in comparison to the lender, a reversal of the normal consumer lending information asymmetry, where the lender must underwrite the loan to assess creditworthiness.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{schools in}} Ontario offer a third method of FSL education: the Extended French program. Students enter into this program {{as early as}} Grade 4—the {{starting}} grade is set by each region's school board—and may continue the program through to graduation. The program can also be entered when beginning secondary school; however, {{as there is a}} prerequisite number of previous instruction hours, usually only students previously enrolled in the Extended French or French Immersion programs can enter. In this program, at least 25% of all instruction must be in French. From Grades 4 through 8, this means that at least one course per year other than [...] "French as a Second Language" [...] must be taught solely in French. From Grades 9 through 12, along with taking the Extended French language course every year, students must complete their mandatory Grade 9 Geography and Grade 10 Canadian History credits in French. Students who complete these required courses and take one <b>extra</b> <b>credit</b> taught in French receive a [...] upon graduation in addition to their diploma.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the end of}} July, The Escapist privately {{contacted}} Portnow with a disputing {{claim for}} the funds.

The forum was publicly acknowledged by Portnow on July 21 and August 25, and was re-launched on a new domain for the show around January 10, 2012. Meant for PAX East 2012, a tribute video to <b>Extra</b> <b>Credits</b> was also made featuring some fans and colleagues of the crew. This was the basis for an independent testimonial program.|$|R

50|$|Teachers employ <b>extra</b> <b>credit</b> for {{a variety}} of reasons.
