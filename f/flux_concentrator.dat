40|$|The {{modulator}} for the SLC e+ source <b>flux</b> <b>concentrator</b> provides 16 kA in a 5 p sinusoidal half {{wave current}} for a pure inductive load, at 120 Hz. The modulator incorporates 10 EEV CX 1622 thyratrons in a switching network. It provides reliable operation with acceptable thyratron lifetime. I. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS Stanford Linear Collider (SLC) is an accelerator which collides electrons and positrons for particle physics research at SLAC. Such a collider requires a high yield positron source (See Reference 1 for details). The <b>flux</b> <b>concentrator</b> is a pulsed magnet {{that produces a}} focusing solenoidal magnetic field to effectively capture positrons emitted from an electron beam target (Figure 1). Positron production and capture are discussed in Reference 2. The production of a high magnetic field in the <b>flux</b> <b>concentrator</b> (up to 5. 8 Tesla) requires a current pulse of 16 kA. The <b>flux</b> <b>concentrator</b> modulator provides 16 kA pulses at 120 Hz to the magnet. Another design consideration is the system inductance. The inductance of the <b>flux</b> <b>concentrator</b> is approximately 1 p. H. A more {{detailed description of the}} <b>flux</b> <b>concentrator</b> is elsewhere in these proceedings (Ref. 3). The low inductance of the magnet requires a low inductance driver to meet the system’s pulse requirements. The magnet’s low impedance makes efficient energy transfer to the <b>flux</b> <b>concentrator</b> difficult. II. MODULATOR DESIGN The <b>flux</b> <b>concentrator</b> modulator has four modules all of which charge by the same charging system composed of a high voltage power supply, a charging capacitor, and a charging inductor.

The measurement methods used today has major drawbacks.

The operation of such sensors in an unshielded environment gives rise to 1 /f noise due to thermally activated movement of trapped flux vortices in the superconducting body. Vortex trapping can be prevented by dividing the superconducting body into narrow strips. The strips have a certain critical field below which no vortex trapping occurs. A new model for the critical field of vortex trapping in thin film strips has been derived and experimentally verified by scanning SQUID microscope measurements. The results show an excellent agreement between the critical field and the model values. Hybrid magnetometers with bismuth and doped silicon Hall sensors have been produced.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the issue of cost {{reduction}} in direct-drive generators for wind turbines. Today, the combination gearbox-medium-speed (1000 - 2000 rpm) induction generator largely dominates the market of MW-scale wind turbines. This is due to the lower costs of the gearbox option compared to the costs of gearless systems. Nevertheless, there is an acute interest among researchers and wind turbine suppliers in the possibility of removing gears and slip rings from the drive train, leading to lower maintenance (no oil is required and slip rings can be avoided) and higher reliability due to the absence of wear between gears. The direction followed by the thesis is the investigation and comparison of various permanent magnet (PM) machine topologies. The aim is to identify the topology(ies) with the lowest cost/torque and highest torque/ mass. A new TFPM geometry, called TFPM machine with toothed rotor, is derived in the. The new machine topology has the following characteristics: the stator is single-sided, the rotor PM and <b>flux</b> <b>concentrators</b> are independent from the build-up of mechanical tolerances, the installation of rotor parts (PM and <b>flux</b> <b>concentrators)</b> can be automated and the flux circulation allows laminated steel {{to be used in the}} stator core. A prototype of the TFPM machine with toothed rotor is presented. The comparison between TFPM machines with toothed rotor and conventional PM synchronous machines is discussed. Comparison of the cost/torque and torque/mass of the two machine topologies for diameters ranging between 0. 5 m and 3. 0 m showed favorable expected performances of the TFPM machine with toothed rotor for diameters of 0. 5 m and 1. 0 m. However, diameters larger than 1. 0 m favored the conventional PM synchronous machine with/without flux-concentration. Using the results of the optimization process, the costs of active material are computed for a 1. 5 MW wind turbine. It is found that active material represents about 5 % of the total turbine cost, while previous estimates indicated that the generator costs are rather between 30 % and 40 % of a complete direct-drive wind turbine. Therefore, further optimizaÂ¬tion of direct-drive machines should also include the costs of manufacturing and the costs of the mechanical structure.

In order to handle complicated transmission line configuration with the proposed method, an improved current monitoring technology is proposed in Chapter 3. It is realized by developing a current source reconstruction method based on stochastic optimization strategy. This concept of current monitoring by magnetic field sensing and current source reconstruction was experimentally implemented and verified in our laboratory setup. A typical model of 500 kV three-phase transmission lines was simulated to further corroborate this technology. The reconstruction results for the 500 kV transmission lines verify the feasibility and practicality of this novel current monitoring technology based on magnetic field sensing {{at the top of a}} transmission tower for monitoring overhead transmission lines. Chapter 4 offers further improvement of the transmission-line monitoring technology. Improved technology can measure simultaneously both electrical and spatial parameters of multiple lines in real-time in a non-contact way. Two typical models of high-voltage three-phase transmission lines were simulated and the resulting magnetic fields were calculated. A source reconstruction method was developed to reconstruct the spatial and electrical parameters from the magnetic field emanated by the overhead transmission lines. The reconstruction results for the 500 kV and 220 kV transmission lines verify the feasibility and practicality of this non-contact transmission-line monitoring technology based on magnetic field sensing. As well as the high-voltage transmission-line, the technology is applied in underground power cable operation-state monitoring and energization-status identification in Chapter 5. The magnetic field distribution of the cable was studied by using finite element method (FEM) for the power cable operating in different states, i. e. current-energized state (the cable is energized and carries load current) and voltage-energized state (the cable is energized but carries no load current). Application of this method was demonstrated on an 11 kV cable with metallic outer sheath. The results highly matched with the actual source parameters of the cable. An experimental setup was constructed and the test results were used for demonstration this method.

40|$|A joint U. S. /Russia {{program has}} been {{conducted}} to design, develop, fabricate, launch, and operate the world's first space solar dynamic power system on the Russian Space Station Mir. The goal {{of the program was}} to demonstrate and confirm that solar dynamic power systems are viable for future space applications such as the International Space Station (ISS). The major components of the system include a solar receiver, a closed Brayton cycle power conversion unit, a power conditioning and control unit, a solar concentrator, a radiator, a thermal control system, and a Space Shuttle carrier. Unfortunately, the mission was demanifested from the ISS Phase 1 Space Shuttle Program in 1996. However, NASA Lewis is proposing to use the fabricated flight hardware as part of an all-American flight demonstration on the ISS in 2002. The present paper concerns the design and analysis of the solar receiver aperture shield assembly. The aperture shield assembly comprises the front face of the cylindrical receiver and is located at the focal plane of the solar concentrator. The aperture shield assembly is a critical component that protects the solar receiver structure from highly concentrated solar <b>fluxes</b> during <b>concentrator</b> off-pointing events. A full-size aperture shield assembly was fabricated. This unit was essentially identical to the flight configuration, with the exception of materials substitution. In addition, a thermal shock test aperture shield assembly was fabricated. This test article utilized the flight materials and was used for high-flux testing in the solar simulator test rig at NASA Lewis. This testing is described in a companion paper...|$|R
