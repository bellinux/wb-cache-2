5|$|Proposed {{methods for}} {{controlling}} gopher populations in agricultural areas include poisoning dandelions, clover, carrots, {{sweet potatoes and}} parsnips. Camas pocket gophers are larger than other gophers, so conventional gopher traps may fail to capture them. Toxic baits and <b>fumigants</b> may also fail, since the gophers will sometimes wall off {{a segment of the}} burrow. Gophers may also cause local flooding if their tunneling activities damage levees.|$|E
5|$|Methods for {{controlling}} {{the spread of}} Armillaria root rot include physical removal of infected trees, stumps and large roots; fumigation of soil around infected hosts; and injection of <b>fumigants</b> directly into infected hosts. These methods are often not practical due to high cost, introduction of toxic chemicals that affect other organisms, or health and safety issues for the operator. Biological control is another method that has been investigated to control root rot caused by A.luteobubalina. In one study, thinning stumps of Eucalyptus diversicolor were simultaneously inoculated with A.luteobubalina {{and one of the}} saprobic wood decay fungi Coriolus versicolor, Stereum hirsutum and Xylaria hypoxylon; all three fungi significantly reduced infection by A.luteobubalinea. These results were echoed in another study of stumps in karri regrowth forests, where it was shown that the presence of other wood decay fungi suppressed the growth of A.luteobubalina on the stump base.|$|E

There are a number of ways to mitigate the effects of improper conditions, however. Methods of stabilizing mummies and halting the deterioration process include inert gas control, where the mummy is placed in a chamber or bag into which <b>fumigants</b> are introduced; wet sterilization, where solutions are applied to the mummy to repel insects and the growth of fungi; controlled drying, which reduces the relative humidity in order to stop growth of microorganisms; and ultra-violet irradiation, which affects microorganisms by altering their cells.|$|E

40|$|Plastic {{films are}} {{commonly}} used to tarp the soil surface to reduce <b>fumigant</b> volatilization losses. Some of the commercial films, however, are relatively permeable to <b>fumigant</b> vapors and {{a large proportion of}} the applied <b>fumigant</b> mass escapes to the atmosphere. The use of low permeability films, such as virtually impermeable films (VIF), semi-impermeable film (SIF), and metalized film, rather than standard polyethylene (PE) films can reduce <b>fumigant</b> emissions to the atmosphere and may improve <b>fumigant</b> performance. To develop realistic management practices that minimize <b>fumigant</b> flux to the atmosphere, film permeability must be assessed. The key to measuring the permeability of the films is to test them after field tarping. Film types and properties vary widely among manufacturers and the label does not accurately characterize film performance in the field. For example, VIF has been shown to have extremely low permeability under laboratory conditions (before tarping), but its permeability changes significantly under field conditions (after tarping). This may be due to a breakdown in the VIF properties under field conditions during tarping (i. e. ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{approach}} to preventing pest infestation has changed {{quite a bit}} in the methodology employed. [...] Where formerly <b>fumigants</b> and pesticides were applied directly to every collection, now more passive and less toxic means of pest management are favored. [...] These newer techniques, termed integrated pest management (IPM), can be just as effective with careful and thorough planning. [...] Different object materials are sensitive to different infestations, so a thorough material understanding of the artifacts to be protected and the pests resident to the area is required. [...] Risks involving the collection building, constructive and decorative materials, and staff activities should be assessed, and a program should then be put in place which reduces these risks.|$|E
5000|$|Dedicating {{more than}} $3 million in {{research}} for alternatives to field <b>fumigants,</b> gaseous pesticides {{injected into the}} soil prior to planting to control soil-borne pests such as insects, fungi, and weed seeds. Due to their gaseous state, fumigantsacan be transported from the soil where they are applied to the air, where they may adversely impact people's health anywhere from hours to days after the fumigant has been applied. DPR's {{research in this area}} underscores their interest and efforts to heighten protections for vulnerable groups, including those who work or live near fields treated with field <b>fumigants,</b> by adding more safety measures to federal labels of field <b>fumigants</b> and adding more evaluation protections. These efforts also include DPR's close work with strawberry growers, research partners, and other stakeholders to find practical and cost-effective alternatives to soil <b>fumigants.</b> Partnering with the strawberry industry is particularly important as California strawberry farmers represent one of the major users of field <b>fumigants,</b> used to protect their crops from harmful pests.|$|E

40|$|To {{find a new}} {{and safe}} {{alternative}} to conventional insecticides, we evaluated the <b>fumigant</b> toxicity of eight Lamiaceae essential oils and their constituents against the adult rice weevil Sitophilus oryzae. Of the eight species tested, hyssop (Hyssopus offcinalis), majoram (Origanum majorana), and Thymus zygis essential oils showed strong <b>fumigant</b> toxicity against S. oryzae adults at 25 mg/L air concentration. Constituents of active essential oils were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization detector (FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 13, 15, and 17 compounds were identified from hyssop, majoram, and Thymus zygis essential oils, respectively. Pinocamphone and isopinocamphone were isolated by open column chromatography. Among the test compounds, pinocamphone and isopinocamphone showed the strongest <b>fumigant</b> toxicity against S. oryzae. Sabinene hydrate, linalool, α-terpineol, and terpinen- 4 -ol exhibited 100 % <b>fumigant</b> toxicity against S. oryzae at 3. 9 mg/L air concentration.

5000|$|Grain storage {{structures}} can develop potentially hazardous atmospheres due to gases produced from spoiling grains and/or fumigation. <b>Fumigants</b> in grain storage bins {{are commonly used}} for insect control. Exposure to <b>fumigants</b> can cause central nervous system damage, heart and vascular disease, and lung edema as well as cancer [...] In addition to the direct health risks associated with fumigant exposure, exposure to these gases can also result in worker incapacitation and subsequently suffering injury from falling or suffocation from engulfment.
