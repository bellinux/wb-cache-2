25|$|Diana was {{the patron}} of HALO Trust, an {{organisation}} that removes debris {{left behind by}} war, in particular landmines. In January 1997, pictures of Diana touring an Angolan minefield in a ballistic helmet and <b>flak</b> <b>jacket</b> were seen worldwide. During her campaign, she was accused of meddling in politics and called a 'loose cannon'. Despite the criticism, HALO states that Diana's efforts resulted in raising international awareness about landmines and the subsequent sufferings caused by them. In June 1997, she gave a speech at a landmines conference held at the Royal Geographical Society, and travelled to Washington, D.C. to help promote the American Red Cross landmines campaign. From 7 to 10 August 1997, just days before her death, she visited Bosnia and Herzegovina with Jerry White and Ken Rutherford of the Landmine Survivors Network.|$|E

Although <b>flak</b> <b>jackets</b> offered some basic protection against small caliber bullets and shell fragments (which was obviously welcomed by their users), ultimately they proved to be less effective than hoped. <b>Flak</b> <b>jackets</b> are now generally considered to be inferior to ballistic vests.|$|R

25|$|DuPont {{has been}} the key company behind the {{development}} of modern body armor. In the Second World War DuPont's ballistic nylon was used by Britain's Royal Air Force to make <b>flak</b> <b>jackets.</b> With the development of Kevlar in the 1960s, DuPont began tests {{to see if it}} could resist a lead bullet. This research would ultimately lead to the bullet resistant vests that are the mainstay of police and military units in the industrialized world.|$|R

25|$|During {{early and}} mid-May, the U.S. also {{launched}} Operation Matador, an assault by around 1,000 Marines in the ungoverned region of western Iraq. Its goal was {{the closing of}} suspected insurgent supply routes of volunteers and material from Syria, and with the fight they received their assumption proved correct. Fighters armed with <b>flak</b> <b>jackets</b> (unseen in the insurgency by this time) and sporting sophisticated tactics met the Marines, eventually inflicting 30 U.S. casualties by the operation's end, and suffering 125 casualties themselves.|$|R
50|$|On {{the evening}} of 10 September 3/26 Marines engaged the 812th NVA Regiment 6 km {{southwest}} of Con Thien. Some of the attacking NVA were wearing USMC helmets and <b>flak</b> <b>jackets</b> and they were well supported mortars and 140mm rockets. An RPG destroyed a flamethrower tank, but the NVA were unable to penetrate Marines lines and US artillery boxed in the Marines forcing the NVA to withdraw by 20:30. The following morning 140 NVA bodies were found around the Marine lines, the Marines had lost 34 dead and 192 wounded.|$|R
50|$|Ballistic nylon is a thick, tough, nylon fabric {{with several}} uses. Ballistic nylon was {{developed}} by the DuPont corporation as a material for <b>flak</b> <b>jackets</b> to be worn by World War II airmen. The term ballistic nylon originates in the fabric's intended function, protecting its wearers from flying debris and fragmentation caused by bullet and artillery-shell impacts. It was not effective against most pistol and rifle bullets, let alone heavy 20 mm and 30 mm autocannons, with which Axis fighters often were armed. Ballistic nylon has been replaced by Kevlar and other, more effective, bullet resistant fabrics for these cases.|$|R
