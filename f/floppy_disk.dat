5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{was one of}} {{the first}} games {{concurrently}} released on CD-ROM and <b>floppy</b> <b>disk.</b> A <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> version was created to accommodate consumers that had yet to purchase CD-ROM drives. The CD-ROM format afforded the addition of audible dialog. The capacity difference between the two formats necessitated alterations to the <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> version. Grossman spent several weeks reducing files sizes and removing files such as the audio dialog to fit the game onto six diskettes.|$|E
5|$|The +2B board (AMSTRAD {{part number}} Z70833) has no {{provision}} for <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> controller circuitry and the +3B motherboard (Amstrad part number Z70835) has {{no provision for}} connecting an internal tape drive.|$|E
5|$|After {{reading the}} work of Mark Frauenfelder on Boing boing, Idol hired him to use {{graphics}} software {{in the design of}} artwork associated with the album. This included its use for the album and singles' cover art, the Billy Idol's Cyberpunk <b>floppy</b> <b>disk,</b> and in the press pack released to the media.|$|E

5000|$|In 1983 Sony {{introduced}} 90 mm micro diskettes (better {{known as}} 3.5 in <b>floppy</b> <b>disks),</b> {{which it had}} developed {{at a time when}} there were 4" [...] <b>floppy</b> <b>disks,</b> and a lot of variations from different companies, to replace the then on-going 5.25" [...] <b>floppy</b> <b>disks.</b> Sony had great success and the format became dominant. 3.5" [...] <b>floppy</b> <b>disks</b> gradually became obsolete as they were replaced by current media formats.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of the DISCiPLE and +D systems, most software released for them took the form of utility software. The ZX Spectrum +3 enjoyed much more success when it came to commercial software releases on <b>floppy</b> <b>disk.</b> More than 700 titles were released on 3-inch disk from 1987 to 1997.|$|E
5|$|The ZX Spectrum +3, {{released}} in 1987, looked {{similar to the}} +2A but featured a built-in 3-inch <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> drive (like the Amstrad CPC 6128) instead of the tape drive, and was in a black case. It was launched in 1987, initially retailed for £249 and then later £199 and was the only Spectrum capable of running the CP/M operating system without additional hardware.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} on both <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> and CD-ROM, with the CD version featuring a fully voiced cast of characters. For the Japanese PlayStation and Saturn releases, all voice acting was redone by a prominent Japanese comedian, a major selling point for the game in Japan. A port had been under way for the Philips CD-i in 1996, and had entered its final stages of development, but was never released.|$|E

50|$|He {{always had}} a {{technology}} orientation and {{with the arrival of}} <b>floppy</b> <b>disks</b> in 1987, he sensed a great business opportunity in a new and upcoming field. With the same business model of distribution and trading, he expanded the business portfolio from <b>floppy</b> <b>disks</b> to hard drives and RAMs.|$|R
50|$|The {{disk drive}} {{can be used}} with Hitachi Maxell 2.8-inch double sided <b>floppy</b> <b>disks,</b> with a {{capacity}} of 144 kilobytes non-formatted and 100 kilobytes formatted. Each side has 20 sectors of 2.5 kB. A maximum of 20 files can be saved {{on each side of the}} <b>floppy</b> <b>disks.</b>|$|R
5|$|Referred to during {{development}} as the ZX81 Colour and ZX82, it was launched as the ZX Spectrum by Sinclair {{to highlight the}} machine's colour display, compared with {{the black and white}} of its predecessor, the ZX81. The Spectrum was released as eight different models, ranging from the entry level with 16KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum +3 with 128KB RAM and built in <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> drive in 1987; together they sold over 5 million units worldwide (not counting clones).|$|E
5|$|The only <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> drives {{that were}} readily {{available}} in 1975 were IBM compatible 8-inch drives. MITS selected the Pertec FD400 disk drive which could store over 300,000 bytes of data. The Altair disk controller occupied two boards and had over 60 ICs. The initial units were to be available in August, but were delayed {{until the end of}} 1975. The production version of Extended Disk BASIC was released in April 1976. The controller with one disk drive sold for $1,480 (kit) and $1,980 (assembled).|$|E
5|$|However, {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of the PowerBook100 did not last. Sales decreased, and by December 1991 the 140 and 170 models had become more popular because customers {{were willing to pay}} more for a built-in <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> drive and second serial port, which the PowerBook100 lacked. By August 10, 1992, Apple quietly dropped the PowerBook100 from its price list but continued to sell existing stock through its own dealers and alternative discount consumer-oriented stores such as Price Club. In these stores, a 4MB RAM/40MB hard drive configuration with a floppy drive sold for less than $1,000 (more than $1,500 less than the similar 2MB/20MB configuration's original list price).|$|E
2500|$|Recordable CDs {{with even}} greater capacity, {{compatible}} with existing infrastructure of CD-ROM drives, made the expensive new high-capacity floppy technologies obsolete. The <b>floppy</b> <b>disk's</b> remaining reusability advantage was then eliminated by re-writeable CDs. However, writing and rewriting CDs was never as fast or convenient as writing on <b>floppy</b> <b>disks,</b> when the data fits {{on one or}} two <b>floppy</b> <b>disks.</b> Networking, advancements in flash-based devices, and widespread adoption of USB provided another alternative that in turn made both <b>floppy</b> <b>disks</b> and optical storage obsolete for some purposes. The rise of file sharing and multi-megapixel digital photography encouraged the use of files larger than most 3½-inch disks, the largest-capacity standard <b>disks,</b> could hold. <b>Floppy</b> <b>disks</b> were commonly used as sneakernet carriers for file transfer, but the broad availability of LANs and fast Internet connections provided a simpler and faster method of transferring such files, where the air-gapping of a sneakernet is not an important benefit. Other removable storage devices have advantages in both capacity and performance when network connections are unavailable or when networks are inadequate.|$|R

5|$|The PowerBook100 was {{the first}} PowerBook to {{incorporate}} SCSI Disk Mode, which allowed it {{to be used as}} an external hard disk on a desktop Macintosh. This provided a convenient method for software to be installed onto the PowerBook or transferred to the desktop, without the need for the 100's optional <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> drive. A specialized SCSI cable with a unique connector was required, however, to use any SCSI device on the PowerBook series. A second dedicated cable was required for SCSI Disk Mode. This feature was unique to the 100 until Apple introduced new PowerBooks more than a year later.|$|E
5|$|Viewing the Sun during partial and annular eclipses (and during total eclipses {{outside the}} {{brief period of}} totality) {{requires}} special eye protection, or indirect viewing methods if eye damage is to be avoided. The Sun's disk can be viewed using appropriate filtration to block the harmful part of the Sun's radiation. Sunglasses do not make viewing the Sun safe. Only properly designed and certified solar filters {{should be used for}} direct viewing of the Sun's disk. Especially, self-made filters using common objects such as a <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> removed from its case, a Compact Disc, a black colour slide film, smoked glass, etc. must be avoided.|$|E
5|$|There were {{disk drive}} {{interfaces}}, {{such as the}} Abbeydale Designers/Watford Electronics SPDOS, Abbeydale Designers/Kempston KDOS and Opus Discovery. The SPDOS and KDOS interfaces {{were the first to}} come bundled with office productivity software (Tasword Word Processor, Masterfile database and Omnicalc spreadsheet). This bundle, together with OCP's Stock Control, Finance and Payroll systems, introduced small businesses to a streamlined, computerised operation. The most popular <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> systems (except in East Europe) were the DISCiPLE and +D systems released by Miles Gordon Technology in 1987 and 1988 respectively. Both systems had the ability to store memory images onto disk snapshots could later be used to restore the Spectrum to its exact previous state. They were both compatible with the Microdrive command syntax, which made porting existing software much simpler.|$|E

5|$|During {{his initial}} {{research}} into cyberculture, Idol ordered Beyond Cyberpunk! from Gareth Branwyn. The HyperCard stack, which included collections of essays on cyberpunk culture, inspired Idol to include similar material within the Cyberpunk album {{as a special}} edition digipak feature. Discussing the matter with Branwyn, Idol received an initial bid {{for the job of}} producing the disk from the writer. While this bid was under consideration by Idol's management company, Idol had purchased a book-on-disk by Jaime Levy at a Los Angeles bookstore. At the time, Levy was the author and publisher of Electronic Hollywood, one of the first magazines produced on <b>floppy</b> <b>disk.</b> Impressed by its contents, Idol set about contacting her for the job of producing the disk. Successfully under-bidding Branwyn, she was then given the job and a master tape of recorded songs – which were not yet compiled into CD format – for use in sampling. Levy was given permission to include whatever content she desired. Meeting Idol to find what he was interested in presenting in the disk, his only concern was that the whole cyberpunk genre be represented as much as possible.|$|E
5|$|Team member Lucas Davis {{compiled}} {{the development}} tools and documentation for Anachronox and released them in August 2001. Four bug-fixing patches exist for Anachronox. Ion Storm {{created the first}} (1.01), which fixed the Windows 2000 buffer overrun crash and implemented other improvements such as taxi-cabs between distant points and enhanced save game functionality. Ion Storm released the first patch (1.01) on July 2, 2001. Joey Liaw set up a GeoCities website for reporting bugs and technical information after the game's release, and worked on a new patch in his spare time. The second patch (1.02, or build 44) was released in May 2003 and overhauls the save-game system and provides other important stability fixes. The third and fourth patches—1.02 (build 45), released September 2003, and 1.02 (build 46), released April 2004—are fan-made unofficial patches and fix {{most of the remaining}} bugs. Fans have translated the game into German and released a conversion patch. Level designer Rich Carlson released a scrapped secret level for Anachronox in February 2004 after finding it on an old <b>floppy</b> <b>disk.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{game was}} {{designed}} at Nintendo's Research and Development 1 (R) division, while the programming was {{handled by the}} external company Intelligent Systems (known as Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena at the time). The game was developed for the Family Computer Disk System (FDS) because the peripheral's Disk Card media allowed for three times the storage capacity of the Family Computer's (and NES's) console's cartridges. Combined with the possibility to store the players' progress, the <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> format enabled the developers to create a longer game with a more extensive game world. Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena was Toru Osawa's debut as a video game designer, {{and he was the}} only staff member working on the game {{at the beginning of the}} project. Osawa (credited in the U.S. version as Inusawa) intended to make Light Myth: Palutena's Mirror an action game with role-playing elements, and wrote a story rooted in Greek mythology, which he had always been fond of. He drew the pixel art, and wrote the technical specifications, which were the basis for the playable prototype that was programmed by Intelligent Systems. After Nintendo's action-adventure Metroid had been finished, more staff members were allotted to the development of Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena.|$|E
25|$|Before {{internet}} connectivity was widespread, computer viruses {{were typically}} spread by infected <b>floppy</b> <b>disks.</b> Antivirus software came into use, but was updated relatively infrequently. During this time, virus checkers essentially {{had to check}} executable files and the boot sectors of <b>floppy</b> <b>disks</b> and hard disks. However, as internet usage became common, viruses began to spread online.|$|R
50|$|System 7.0 through 7.1 {{offered a}} utility called Apple File Exchange, which could access the {{contents}} of FAT- and Apple II-formatted <b>floppy</b> <b>disks.</b> System 7 Pro, System 7.5 and up shipped with PC Exchange, previously a separate product, which allowed the system to mount FAT-formatted <b>floppy</b> <b>disks</b> on the desktop {{in the same manner}} as regular Macintosh disks.|$|R
5000|$|Most Amiga {{programs}} were distributed on double density <b>floppy</b> <b>disks.</b> There are also 3.5" [...] high density <b>floppy</b> <b>disks,</b> which {{hold up to}} 1.76 MB of data, but these are uncommon. The Amiga also had 5.25" [...] double density disks. The WinUAE Amiga emulator supports all three disk formats, but 3.5" [...] double density is the most common.|$|R
5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{the term}} <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> persisted, even though later model floppy disks {{had a hard}} case around an {{internal}} <b>floppy</b> <b>disk.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{more than}} two decades, the <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> was the primary {{external}} writable storage device used. Most computing environments before the 1990s were non-networked, and floppy disks were the primary means of transferring data between computers, a method known informally as sneakernet. Unlike hard disks, floppy disks are handled and seen; even a novice user can identify a <b>floppy</b> <b>disk.</b> Because of these factors, {{a picture of a}} 3½-inch <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> has become an interface metaphor for saving data. The <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> symbol is still used by software on user-interface elements related to saving files, such as the release of Microsoft Office 2013, even though the physical floppy disks are largely obsolete.|$|E
