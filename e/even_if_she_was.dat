5|$|Meanwhile, the German {{conquest of}} Norway in April 1940 further eroded {{any chance of}} {{completing}} Graf Zeppelin. Now responsible for defending Norway's long coastline and numerous port facilities, the Kriegsmarine urgently needed large numbers of coastal guns and anti-aircraft batteries. During a naval conference with Hitler on 28 April 1940, Admiral Erich Raeder proposed halting all work on Graf Zeppelin, arguing that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> commissioned {{by the end of}} 1940, final installation of her guns would need another ten months or more (her original fire control system had been sold to the Soviet Union under an earlier trade agreement). Hitler consented to the stop work order, allowing Raeder to have Graf Zeppelins 15cm guns removed and transferred to Norway. The carrier's heavy flak armament of twelve 10.5cm guns had already been diverted elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Nagpal was {{suspended}} on 28 July 2013, {{a day after}} she allegedly demolished a wall of an under-construction mosque in Kadalpur village, in the Rabupura area of Greater Noida. The construction of the mosque had not been cleared by the state government. Whether Nagpal was actually involved in the demolition of the wall, and whether she was justified in her actions <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> are disputed. Her supporters {{and most of the}} media sources claim that Nagpal did not order the demolition of the wall and was not even present at the site when the incident happened. According to them, she was targeted due to her campaign against illegal sand-mining, and allegations of Nagpal's involvement in the demolition are false. However, there are other sources which quote residents of Kadalpur village claiming that Nagpal personally supervised the demolition of the wall.|$|E

Chronicles recount several {{instances}} when she advised the king (even {{if he did not}} always take her advice). Her first key advice was to recall Yazathingyan to put down the rebellions. The king, who had just exiled the old minister, grudgingly agreed to her advice in 1258. Yazathingyan went on to put down the rebellions.|$|E

25|$|Professor Trelawney first {{appears in}} the third book of the series, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione start divination lessons. The friends {{generally}} believe Professor Trelawney is a fraud. However, Gryffindor students Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown are very fond of and impressed by her. According to Professor McGonagall, her credibility as a Seer is undermined by her habit of erroneously predicting, each year, {{the death of one}} of her students. Her more profound predictions seem only to happen when she is in a trance and unaware of what she is saying, with no memory of it afterward. However, almost all her predictions were later to be shown true in the books <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not in a trance.|$|E
500|$|The {{frequent}} [...] "use of force" [...] reports {{required to}} document responses became {{a source of}} concern for facility officials. According to an internal document obtained and partially read aloud by Gartner, eventually Corrections Canada administrators instructed guards and supervisors not to respond to self-strangling attempts by Smith, [...] "to ignore her, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> choking herself". CSC officials kept transferring her to other facilities, preventing {{the implementation of a}} Canadian law requiring mandatory review of prisoners kept in isolation for more than sixty days.|$|E

2500|$|Historians both in China {{and abroad}} have long portrayed {{her as a}} despot {{responsible}} for {{the fall of the}} Qing dynasty. Others have suggested that her opponents among the reformers and revolutionaries succeeded in blaming her for problems beyond her control. Furthermore, they claim that she intervened decisively to prevent political disorder, was no more ruthless than other rulers of her time, and that she was an effective reformer {{in the last years of}} her life, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> reluctant to take on this role.|$|E
2500|$|According to the English {{translation}} of the book, The Wives of the Messenger of Allah by Muhammad Swaleh Awadh, it states that {{she was married to}} Muhammad in Dhul Qa'adah, in the fifth year of Hijra. Since Zaynab was the wife of Muhammad's adopted son, pre-Islamic practices frowned upon such her marriage with the prophet. [...] Arab society would have viewed this union as profoundly wrong; because they considered an adopted son was truly a [...] "son", for a man to marry his adopted son's wife - <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> divorced - was considered wrong.|$|E
2500|$|Later on Eurydice married Ptolemy. It is {{unlikely}} that Eurydice voluntarily married her eldest son’s murderer, most probably she acted to ensure the succession of her remaining sons. A new pretender of the throne, Pausanias was very popular and was attracting support in Macedonia. Queen Eurydice asked the Athenian general Iphicrates (their father’s adoptive son) to protect the throne for her two sons. Iphicrates drove out Pausanias. There {{is no evidence that}} Ptolemy had any role in this matter, or suggests [...] that anyone other than Eurydice would have influenced Iphicrates. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> prompted by Ptolemy, her successful intervention in political and military affairs remains remarkably bold and without any known precedent, an extraordinary act for a royal woman. Eurydice took the unprecedented step of seeking international help when she believed the succession of her remaining sons was in jeopardy and her attempt was successful.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, roughly 50 million Americans—half the {{population}} at that time—attended the movies every week. As Bow grew into womanhood, her stature as a [...] "boy" [...] in her old gang became [...] "impossible". She {{did not have any}} girlfriends, and school was a [...] "heartache" [...] and her home was [...] "miserable." [...] On the silver screen, however, she found consolation; [...] "For {{the first time in my}} life I knew there was beauty in the world.

I knew I would have done it differently. I couldn't analyze it, but I could always feel it.". [...] "I'd go home and be a one girl circus, taking the parts of everyone I'd seen, living them before the glass."

2500|$|Reforms {{were carried}} out in 1993. Although all feminist {{projects}} seeking clear recognition of the two sexes were not carried to term, reforms inclined towards a sharing of authority between the two spouses instead of the exclusive authority of the father. Amendment no. 93-74 of July 12, 1993 modified the Code giving wives the right to transfer her patrimony and nationality to children {{to the same extent}} as husbands, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> married to a foreigner, on the sole condition that the father has given his approval. Other measures consecrated the participation of the mother in the conduct of business concerning children and the obligatory consent of the mother for the marriage of her minor child. Furthermore, women acquired the right to represent their children in several judicial procedures, to open and to manage a savings account for their benefit. Furthermore, the text makes it obligatory for spouses to be treated with [...] "kindness" [...] and to participate in the management of the home. Until then women had to accept the husband's prerogative. Finally, another prescription annulled the privilege of paternal grandparents to receive support payments for children. It made maternal grandparents equally entitled, eliminating the concept of the patriarchal family.|$|E
2500|$|Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} final installment, summarizing it as [...] "a perfect balance of nostalgia, mythology, wit, trickery, and closure". Despite calling the choice of Dan being Gossip Girl [...] "edgy, daring and probably dripping in inconsistency," [...] she was satisfied that [...] "it didn’t {{turn out to be}} an unknown person or peripheral character. The writers chose Gossip Girl straight from the heart of the gang — and that decision deserves some respect." [...] She also appreciated the flashbacks describing them as [...] "charming" [...] as well as Chuck and Blair's wedding, which she called [...] "gorgeous", and enjoyed the guest-star appearances. Writing for Newsday, Verne Gay thought the reveal of who was behind Gossip Girl was not surprising but was [...] "a nice sort of perverse poetic justice." [...] The Hollywood Reporter Philiana Ng wrote the episode [...] "reminded viewers of what Gossip Girl ultimately is and should be remembered as: a soapy, cheeky guilty pleasure." [...] Rating it 4.8/5, Courtney Morrison of TV Fanatic described the finale as [...] "epic". She liked Desmond Harrington's return and picked the five-year flash forward as a highlight of the episode. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> surprised that Dan turned out to be Gossip Girl, she found that it [...] "made sense".|$|E
