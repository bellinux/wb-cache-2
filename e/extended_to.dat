5|$|Between 1918 and 1926, Route 46 was <b>{{extended}}</b> <b>to</b> Sheridan. Soon after, in 1933, it extended south, {{two miles}} east of Sheridan. The extension caused the road to Sheridan to become a spur route of Route 46. The spur route was then extended west into Nodaway County around 1948–1949, and was numbered supplemental route D. Four years later, the route was <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> Route 27 (now Route 148). In 1954, Route 246 was designated, starting from Sheridan, and ending at Route 46. The next year, Route 246 was <b>extended</b> <b>to</b> replace supplemental route D as the main connector from Hopkins to Route 46. The whole route was surfaced in concrete by 1959.|$|E

As the storm neared Florida, the United States Weather Bureau—later the National Weather Service—posted storm warnings between Miami and Titusville.
