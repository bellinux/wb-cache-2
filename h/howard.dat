5|$|<b>Howard</b> {{was born}} in Los Angeles, California, to writer Cheryl <b>Howard</b> Crew (née Alley) and actor-director Ron <b>Howard,</b> on March 2, 1981. She has two younger sisters, twins Jocelyn and Paige, and a younger brother named Reed. Through her father, she is a granddaughter of actors Rance <b>Howard</b> and Jean Speegle <b>Howard</b> {{as well as a}} niece of actor Clint <b>Howard.</b> Her godfather is actor Henry Winkler, who co-starred on Happy Days with her father.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} at Lukeville POE at 3 or 3:30 PM, the two agents interviewed <b>Howard</b> and Maureen Cotterman separately. <b>Howard</b> Cotterman {{offered to help}} the agents with the computer, but the offer was declined. At 6 PM, the two agents left with both laptops and one digital camera. The devices were taken to Tucson and delivered to John Owens, an ICE Computer Forensic Examiner at 11 PM that night. The camera was returned to the Cottermans as {{there was no evidence}} of contraband found. However, on April 8, Agent Owens' forensic examination turned up approximately 75 images of child pornography on <b>Howard</b> Cotterman's computer. Agent Owens called the Cottermans that night, asking <b>Howard</b> Cotterman for assistance opening the password protected files. <b>Howard</b> Cotterman agreed to come in the next day, but only his wife showed up to pick up the other laptop.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} hand, Lady Fingers {{questioned}} <b>Howard</b> {{how he could}} have made that $1000 raise, to which <b>Howard</b> replied that poker was all about making the wrong move at the right time. On third street, the Kid bet $1000 into a $1000 pot {{with a pair of}} 10s shows while <b>Howard</b> had just a Queen high. By raising $1000, <b>Howard</b> was possibly representing a Queen in the hole and trying to buy the pot at the point. The Kid only had to put in another $1000 into a $4000, so he was offered 4 to 1 odds, which were very favorable odds, since he only had to be right 1 in 5 times to break even. <b>Howard</b> seemed to be relying on implied odds to justify that raise as well as the $3000 call on fourth street.|$|E
50|$|Demoralised by <b>Howard's</b> {{death and}} short of supplies, the English fleet retreated to Plymouth, where <b>Howard's</b> brother Thomas took command. The French were unable to exploit <b>Howard's</b> death, and after {{successful}} English campaigns in Picardy and Scotland, a truce was agreed on in March 1514.|$|R
50|$|Singer Ali <b>Howard's</b> melodies are {{romantic and}} bittersweet. The jubilant lyrics often belie melancholic themes. <b>Howard's</b> sweet, girlish vocals drew {{comparisons}} to Dusty Springfield and Sandie Shaw. Music critics noted similarities to alternative dance band Saint Etienne in <b>Howard's</b> affectionate presentation of tragic lyrics.|$|R
40|$|<b>Howard’s</b> policy {{iteration}} {{algorithm is}} one of the most widely used algorithms for finding optimal policies for controlling Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). When applied to weighted directed graphs, which may be viewed as Deterministic MDPs (DMDPs), <b>Howard’s</b> algorithm can be used to find Minimum Mean-Cost cycles (MMCC). Experimental studies suggest that <b>Howard’s</b> algorithm works extremely well in this context. The theoretical complexity of <b>Howard’s</b> algorithm for finding MMCCs is a mystery. No polynomial time bound is known on its running time. Prior to this work, there were only linear lower bounds on the number of iterations performed by <b>Howard’s</b> algorithm. We provide the first weighted graphs on which <b>Howard’s</b> algorithm performs Ω(n²) iterations, where n is the number of vertices in the graph...|$|R
5|$|As {{chair of}} the Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services, <b>Howard</b> {{supported}} Premier Campbell's efforts at establishing the Harmonized Sales Tax. Following Campbell's resignation, <b>Howard</b> endorsed Kevin Falcon but Christy Clark won the leadership election. Clark eventually made <b>Howard</b> a Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Transportation. In this position he advocated for Open Sky agreements and continued this advocacy in his post-political life by establishing the non-profit organization OpenSkies4Canada. <b>Howard</b> did not seek re-election during the 2013 provincial election {{and was replaced by}} BC Liberal Teresa Wat.|$|E

5|$|During Michigan's in-home visit, Howard's {{grandmother}} treated Michigan {{head coach}} Fisher, his assistants Mike Boyd and Brian Dutcher, Vocational coach Cook, Vocational assistant coach Donnie Kirskey, Lois <b>Howard</b> (Howard's aunt) and <b>Howard</b> to a soul food dinner. Dutcher had {{the responsibility to}} contact <b>Howard</b> several times a week. <b>Howard</b> grew close to assistant coach Kirskey, often staying at his house and using his car once he got a driver's license. During the summer 1990 30-day visitation period, Dutcher watched <b>Howard</b> practice 28 consecutive days. Dutcher developed {{an understanding of the}} dynamics of Howard's relationship with his grandmother. While other coaches, such as Lute Olsen, almost ignored her during the recruiting, Dutcher understood that she was the key influence on his life, and understood that Kirskey also had sway with <b>Howard.</b> He encouraged Fisher to hire Kirskey for a summer basketball camp that, which became the young athlete's introduction to Ann Arbor, Michigan.|$|E

5|$|Eager to {{add another}} {{franchise}} player to their team, the Rockets heavily pursued free agent center Dwight <b>Howard</b> in the 2013 offseason. On July 5, 2013, <b>Howard</b> announced via his Twitter account {{that he intended to}} sign with the Houston Rockets after the July moratorium period ended. The NBA fined the Rockets $150,000 for talking about <b>Howard</b> during this moratorium period. Dwight <b>Howard</b> officially signed with the Rockets on July 13, 2013. Led by the new inside-out combination of <b>Howard</b> and James Harden, and with a strong supporting cast including Chandler Parsons, Jeremy Lin, and Ömer Aşık, the Rockets were expected to jump into title contention in the upcoming season. However, in the post-season, the Rockets were defeated in the first round by the Portland Trail Blazers, losing the series 4-2.|$|E
