40|$|Objective: Unusual {{clinical}} course Background: Strongyloidiasis usually presents as {{a chronic}} and limited disease, {{but in some}} immunocompromised patients it may become a life-threatening disease. Case Report: A 77 -year-old Haitian male, with history of temporal arteritis on 40 mg of oral prednisone presented complain-ing of decreased oral intake, epigastric pain, and non-bloody diarrhea. He had bi-temporal wasting and a dis-tended abdomen but without guarding or tenderness. Laboratory examination included mild leukocytosis, anemia, negative <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody,</b> <b>negative</b> parasite stool exam, and negative serology for Giardia and Strongyloides. CT of the abdomen showed multiple distended loops, without obstruction. During the admission he had a 4 g hemoglobin drop and a positive occult blood test, requiring blood transfu-sions, IV pantoprazole, and upper endoscopy. Findings included severe duodenitis, blunted villi, and intramu-cosal and luminal helminthic worms and eggs. Pathology showed Strongyloides stercoralis infection, confirmed by subsequent PCR.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in women with Bartholin's gland abscess. SETTING [...] Gynaecology Clinic of King Edward VIII Hospital, a large urban, referral hospital for the province of Kwa-Zulu Natal, serving an underprivileged population. METHODS [...] Thirty consecutive women presenting with unruptured Bartholin's gland abscesses were studied. Prior to surgical drainage, aspirates from the abscess cavity and swab specimens from the vagina and endocervix were collected for microbiological investigations. In addition peripheral venous blood samples were obtained for syphilis and <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> testing. RESULTS [...] <b>Antibody</b> to <b>HIV</b> was detected in 9 of the 30 (30 %) patients studied. Recognised sexually transmitted pathogens were detected in both aspirates and endocervical specimens: Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in 3 aspirate and 2 endocervical specimens whilst Neisseria gonorrhoeae was cultured in 5 aspirate and 7 endocervical specimens. When comparing microorganisms isolated from <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> positive and <b>negative</b> women, only Bacteroides species yielded a significantly higher growth (p = 0. 01) in the antibody positive women. CONCLUSION [...] Our findings show that women with Bartholin's gland abscesses have a high prevalence of <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody.</b> Furthermore, this is the only study that demonstrates a role for C trachomatis in the aetiology of Bartholin's gland abscesses. Health workers should be aware of the need for appropriate counselling, and comprehensive treatment of sexually transmitted infections including C trachomatis in women with Bartholin's gland abscesses...|$|R
30|$|A 14 -year-old boy showing {{paroxysmal}} kinesigenic dyskinesia {{was referred}} to our hospital. He had been suffering from anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain and weight loss of 7  kg for 5  weeks. No bilious emesis was reported. At a previous clinic, he was treated as having enterocolitis or anorexia nervosa, without an improvement. On admission, he looked pale and exhibited fatigue. A physical examination showed that the abdomen was not distended, although a mass, with tenderness, was palpable in the lower abdomen. His abdominal pain was colicky, intermittent and severe at times. Although diarrhea and “currant jelly” bloody stools were not present at that time, the stool was positive for occult blood. A culture of the stools was not remarkable, {{and the results of}} laboratory tests of the blood (including lactate dehydrogenase and antibodies for soluble interleukin- 2 receptor) and urine were within the normal ranges, except for slight elevation of the C-reactive protein level (0.6  mg/dL).

40|$|Background: Nausea and {{vomiting}} are common {{during the first}} half of pregnancy and usually require only supportive measures. When symptoms are progressive and weight loss occurs, treatable causes should be sought by means of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. We report a case of an immunocompetent gravida with invasive Candida albicans esophagitis. Case: The immunocompetent primigravida developed progressive nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, and a 4. 1 kg weight loss during the second trimester of pregnancy. Treatment with metoclopramide and cimetidine for presumed gastroesophageal reflux was not effective. The patient had normal T-cell CD 4 and CD 8 subsets and was human immunodeficiency virus (<b>HIV)</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>negative.</b> Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed C. albicans esophagitis which was treated with oral nystatin. The esophagitis had resolved completely when reassessed postpartum. The use of histamine 2 blockers is associated with an increased risk for fungal esophagitis and may have been a contributing cause in this case. Conclusion: Pregnant patients with persistent nausea, vomiting, and weight loss should be evaluated by endoscopy for fungal esophagitis. (C) 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{describe}} a nosocomial outbreak of cryptosporidiosis during {{four months after}} June 1989. SETTING [...] A department of infectious diseases in Copenhagen, seeing about half the patients with AIDS in Denmark. SUBJECTS [...] 73 <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>negative</b> subjects and 60 antibody positive subjects admitted as inpatients during the transmission period of the outbreak (20 June- 14 August), of whom 18 (17 with AIDS, one with AIDS related complex), developed cryptosporidiosis. Two further HIV negative subjects (one departmental secretary, one visiting relative) developed cryptosporidiosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Cryptosporidia in stool samples, clinical symptoms, CD 4 cell count, HIV antigen concentration, chemotherapeutic treatment. RESULTS [...] The {{source of the outbreak}} was identified as ice from an ice machine in the ward, contaminated by an incontinent, psychotic patient with cryptosporidiosis picking out ice for cold drinks. The mean incubation time was at least 13 days-that is, twice that in HIV-negative patients. Of the 18 patients with AIDS who developed cryptosporidiosis, five recovered, two were symptomless carriers, three died of unrelated causes, and eight died after prolonged diarrhoea. Among the 57 exposed HIV antibody positive inpatients (excluding two patients and the index case with cryptosporidiosis diagnosed elsewhere), significantly more of those who developed symptomatic cryptosporidiosis received oral sulphonamides {{than those who did not}} (91 %, 10 / 11 v 48 %, 21 / 44, p less than 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS [...] The clinical and epidemiological findings indicate that infection was the consequence of very small inocula.

40|$|Background: Recent {{studies have}} shown the public health {{importance}} of identifying acute HIV infection (AHI) in the {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM) of China, which has a much higher risk of HIV transmission. However, cost-utility analyses to guide policy around AHI screening are lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings: An open prospective cohort was recruited among MSM living in Liaoning Province, Northeast China. Blood samples and epidemiological information were collected every 10 weeks. Third-generation ELISA and rapid test were used for <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> screening, western blot assay (WB) served for assay validation. <b>Antibody</b> <b>negative</b> specimens were tested with 24 mini-pool nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Specimens with positive ELISA but negative or indeterminate WB results were tested with NAAT individually without mixing. A cost-utility analysis of NAAT screening was assessed. Among the 5, 344 follow-up visits of 1, 765 MSM in 22 months, <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> tests detected 114 HIV chronic infections, 24 seroconverters and 21 antibody indeterminate cases. 29 acute HIV infections were detected with NAAT from 21 antibody indeterminate and 1, 606 <b>antibody</b> <b>negative</b> cases.

40|$|Background: Acute HIV {{infection}} (AHI) is {{a critical}} phase of infection when irreparable damage to the immune system occurs and subjects are very infectious. We studied subjects with AHI prospectively to develop better treatment and public health interventions. Methods: Cross-sectional screening was employed to detect <b>HIV</b> RNA positive, <b>antibody</b> <b>negative</b> subjects. Date of HIV acquisition was estimated from clinical history and correlated with sequence diversity assessed by single genome amplification (SGA). Twenty-two cytokines/chemokines were measured from enrollment through week 24. Results: Thirty-seven AHI subjects were studied. In 7 participants with limited exposure windows, the median exposure to HIV occurred 14 days before symptom onset. Lack of viral sequence diversification confirmed the short duration of infection. Transmission dates estimated by SGA/sequencing using molecular clock models correlated with transmission dates estimated by symptom onset in individuals infected with single HIV variants (mean of 28 versus 33 days). Only 10 of 22 cytokines/chemokines were significantly elevated among AHI participants at enrollment compared to uninfected controls, and only 4 participants remained seronegative at enrollment. Discussion: The results emphasize the difficulty in recruiting subjects early in AHI. Viral sequence diversity proved accurat...|$|R

To assess this issue 15 patients treated with high-dose "intravenous immunoglobulin" (IVIG) for Graves' Ophthalmopathy had serial determination of glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (GOT), gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (gamma-GT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin that were performed regularly at interval of 3 weeks during IVIG treatment and 6 months {{after the end of the}} treatment. Hepatitis A, B, C and HIV markers were determined before, during and 6 months after the end of the treatment.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{estimate}} {{the risk of}} infection with HIV (HIV 1 or HIV 2, or both) from transfusion of a screened unit of blood in a high prevalence area in west Africa. DESIGN [...] Retrospective cohort study for January-July 1991. SETTING [...] National Blood Transfusion Centre, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. SUBJECTS [...] Repeat donors (5831 units of blood) and first time donors (5076 units) {{in the first five}} months of 1991. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Prevalence and estimated incidence of HIV infection in repeat and first time donors; estimated rate of potentially infected, <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>negative</b> units; and rate of (false negative) potentially infected units assuming a laboratory test sensitivity of 99 %. RESULTS [...] Overall HIV prevalence was 11. 0 % in first time donors and 2. 1 % in repeat donors. In the first seven months of 1991, 29 HIV antibody positive (27 HIV 1, 1 HIV 2, 1 dually reactive) donors with a seronegative unit of blood earlier in the year were identified; 26 had donated blood eight weeks or less before their estimated dates of seroconversion and may have been infectious (minimum rate 26 / 5831 (4. 5 / 1000 potentially infected units)). Estimated incidence of infection in repeat donors was 1. 2 - 2. 5 %. Laboratory test insensitivity would result in an estimated 1. 1 / 1000 false negative units from first time donors and 0. 2 / 1000 units from regular donors. The overall rate of potentially infected units (all donors, seroconversions, and errors) was estimated at 5. 4 - 10. 6 / 1000. CONCLUSIONS [...] The risk of HIV infection from a single unit of blood remains substantial (5. 4 - 10. 6 / 1000 units). To prevent infection from blood transfusion in areas of high incidence and prevalence of HIV all but absolutely essential transfusions should be avoided, and donors with low incidence of HIV infection should be selected...|$|E
40|$|Nigeria {{has one of}} {{the highest}} HIV burdens as well as mother-to-infant {{transmission}} rates in the world. A pilot program using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based testing of dried blood spot (DBS) specimens was implemented to enable early identification of HIV-infected infants and timely referral and linkage to care. From February 2007 to October 2008, whole blood was collected by finger prick to prepare DBS from infants < 18 months presenting in six public mother-and-child health facilities in Lagos, Nigeria. The DBS were tested using the Roche Amplicor HIV- 1 DNA Test, v 1. 5. To monitor laboratory testing quality, all of the PCR-positive and 10 % of the PCR-negative DBS were retested by the same method at another reference laboratory. Three hundred and sixty-five randomly selected infants were screened using HIV rapid tests (RT) according to the national algorithm and RT-negative and PCR-positive specimens were also tested using Genscreen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) (Bio-Rad, France). The turnaround time (TAT) from sample collection, testing, and dispatching of results from each health facility was monitored. A total of 1, 273 infants with a median age of 12. 6 weeks (1 day to 71. 6 weeks) participated in the program and 280 (22. 0 %) were PCR positive. HIV transmission levels varied greatly in the different health facilities ranging from 7. 1 % to 38. 4 %. Infants aged 48 to 72 weeks had the highest level of PCR positivity (41. 1 %). All PCR-positive specimens were confirmed by retesting. The mean turnaround time from DBS collection to returning of the laboratory result to the health facilities was 25 days. Three infants were found to be <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>negative</b> by rapid tests but were positive by both PCR and the fourth generation EIA.

40|$|Paclitaxel (PTX) {{has been}} shown to be efficacious with minimal {{toxicity}} in patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and transplantation-associated KS. Recently, a few cases of non-AIDS-associated KS treated with PTX have been reported. We report here a patient with classical KS who showed a dramatic response to weekly PTX therapy. Complete remission was maintained for 8 months. After lesions recurred, the same PTX regimen was resumed, resulting in a renewed remission. CASE REPORT A 52 -year-old Japanese man had been treated for clas-sical KS since the age of 32 years. Despite several excision and radiotherapy treatments (totally 65 Gy for each lesion), the disease progressed to multiple tumours on his extremities. Physical examination in Novem-ber 2003, before initiation of PTX treatment, showed multiple violaceous to dark-red patches, plaques, and nodules of varying sizes on a background of severely oedematous skin on his legs, arms, buttocks, hands and soles (Fig. 1 A). Histological examination showed mul-tiple small slit-like vascular proliferations in the dermis and spindle cell proliferation around these vessels (Fig. 2 A, B). The spindle cells were CD 34 -positive. Human herpesvirus 8 DNA sequences were detected from skin tumour by PCR technique. Human immunodeficiency virus (<b>HIV)</b> <b>antibody</b> was <b>negative</b> in serum. There was no evidence of systemic involvement of KS. Weekly, intravenous treatments with PTX (TAXOL®, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico) 80 mg/m 2 /week, for 3 consecutive weeks, every 4 weeks were then initiated. After 4 treatment courses, the KS dramatically improved with an almost complete disap-pearance of all skin lesions and pain due to oedema of the legs.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundMany {{cases of}} acute human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infection (AHI) present to the Emergency Department (ED). Early diagnosis allows a patient to modify their behavior and seek early treatment. The Emergency Physician should know that the antibody response may be absent. ObjectiveWe report a case of AHI and review its presentation to increase the awareness of this important diagnosis. Case ReportA 20 -year-old black man who {{had a history of}} sex with men initially presented to the ED with a chief complaint of blood per rectum when he passed stool, and chills for the prior few days. His work-up was normal, including a rapid HIV screen, and he was discharged. He returned 2 weeks later with constipation, fatigue, myalgias, decreased urination, chills, and a productive cough. His physical examination was unremarkable, <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> test was <b>negative,</b> but his laboratory tests showed an elevation of creatine phosphokinase, amylase, and lipase. His blood count showed a normal hematocrit and white blood cell count, but there were juvenile and vacuolated white cells and giant platelets reported. HIV viral load was reported as > 1, 000, 000 copies/mL. Conclusions/SummaryThis case illustrates that AHI can present as a non-specific illness. Patients at risk should be screened for HIV. However, AHI can occur before there is a significant antibody response. In such cases, a viral load test may help make the diagnosis, allowing for early treatment and patient counseling...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the studies that are reported in this thesis were to evaluate HIV antibody testing strategies and prognostic markers and to study inummological deterioration of HIV- 1 infected individuals. Alternative testing strategies for confirmation of HIV seropositivity were evaluated using combinations of screening assays. Wellcozyme recombinant, Organon Vironostika, Abbott recombinant and Enzygnost anti-HIV- 1 / 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and two simple/rapid assays, HIV-CHECK and Serodia were evaluated using 1, 861 sera. Several combinations of these assays {{were found to have}} a diagnostic accuracy comparable to a screening assay followed by Western blot analysis (WB). The cost of confirming a positive sample was 2 - 3 times less compared to ELISA followed by WB analysis. A modified WHO alternative confirmatory testing strategy was also evaluated using two consecutive ELISAs, Enzygnost HIV- 1 / 2 and Wellcozyme HIV- 1 recombinant assays. It was demonstrated that a second ELISA based on different antigens and a different test principle could be used {{as an alternative to the}} WB assay for confirmation of HIV antibodies. Three simple/rapid 141 V assays, Capillus, Serocard and Determine were evaluated using 1412 fresh sera to formulate an alternative confirmatory strategy for the diagnosis of HIV infection. All assays had a sensitivity of 1 OO%. In an alternative confirmatory strategy the use of Capillus followed by Serocard or Determine gave a specificity of 99. 9 % and 99. 8 % respectively. Serocard followed by Determine gave a specificity of 99. 3 %. A testing strategy with 100 % specificity (95 % Cl; 99. 6 - 100 %) could be achieved by the sequential use of all three simple/ rapid assays or by repeat testing by Capillus followed by Serocard. Immunological and virological predictive markers associated with an increased risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV- 1 were determined among Tanzanian women. T lymphocyte subsets, p 24 antigenemia and beta- 2 microglobulin (beta- 2 M) levels were measured in HIV- 1 infected mothers. Among 138 HIV- 1 seropositive mothers 20. 7 % transmitted HIV infection to their offspring. Mothers with CD 4 + T lymphocytes 2. 0 mg/I had a significantly higher rate of MTCT of HIV- 1 infection (54 %). HIV- 1 p 24 antigenemia was significantly more common in transmitting mothers than in non- transmitting mothers [14 % vs. 2. 3 % (p [...] 0. 05) ]. Therefore, low CD 4 + T lymphocytes% and a high level of beta- 2 M, especially when present in combination, appeared to be useful predictive markers for MTCT of HIV- 1 in Tanzanian women. Reference values of lymphocyte subsets were determined in healthy <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>negative</b> individuals. In addition two methods for enumeration of lymphocyte subsets, SimulSET and MultiSET, were compared using whole blood from both HIV seronegative and seropositive individuals. In seronegative Tanzanian subjects, the percentages of CD 3 + and CD 4 + T lymphocytes and the CD 4 +: CD 8 + T lymphocyte ratios were significantly lower while the percentage of natural killer cells was significantly higher compared to the levels of the corresponding parameters reported among Europeans. Seronegative Tanzanian females had significantly higher levels of CD 3 + and CD 4 + T lymphocytes and CD 4 +: CD 8 + T lymphocyte ratios compared to seronegative males. There was acceptable agreement between the SimulSET and MultiSET flow cytometric methods. The rate of decline of CD 4 + T lymphocytes was determined in a cohort of hotel workers. The mean duration of followup in workers who had three or more CD 4 + T cell determinations and were used for calculations of CD 4 + cell slopes was 71. 4, 52. 9 and 86. 0 months for HIV- 1 seroprevalent (n= 94), HIV- 1 seroincident (n= 77) and seronegative subjects (n= 325), respectively. The median yearly decline of the absolute number and percentage of CD 4 + T lymphocytes (CD 4 +%) was - 21. 0 cells/µl and - 1. 3 % respectively for the HIV- 1 seroprevalent subjects and - 22. 0 cells/µl and - 1. 5 %, respectively for the seroincident subjects. In seroincidents the mean duration to a CD 4 + T lymphocyte level corresponding to definition of AIDS was 13. 3 years or 11. 8 years for CD 4 + counts and percentage, respectively. HIV- 1 seroprevalent individuals who died had a yearly median loss of - 52. 0 % CD 4 + T lymphocytes /PI and - 2. 9 % CD 4 + T lymphocytes compared to a median loss of - 18. 5 CD 4 + T lymphocytes /µl and - 1. 2 % CD 4 + T lymphocytes for those who survived (p = 0. 105 and p< 0. 01 respectively). Among all the HIV- 1 seropositive individuals followed up for a minimum of five years, 14. 1 % did not show a net decline of CD 4 + T lymphocytes. In conclusion, the rate of CD 4 + T lymphocyte decline in HIV- 1 infected individuals in our population is similar to that reported in Europe and North America and a substantial proportion of HIV- 1 infected individuals in this population are long- term-non-progressors...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND. We {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> testing on sexual behavior and communication with sexual partners about AIDS risk among heterosexual adults at a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases. METHODS. We randomized 186 subjects to receive either AIDS education alone (the control group) or AIDS education, an <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> test, and the test results (the intervention group). These subjects were then followed up 8 weeks later. RESULTS. At follow-up, mean {{number of sexual partners}} decreased, but not differently between groups. However, compared with controls, <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> test intervention subjects, all of whom tested negative, questioned their most recent sexual partner more about <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> status (P less than 0. 01), worried more about getting AIDS (P less than 0. 03), and tended to use a condom more often with their last sexual partner (P = 0. 05) : 40 % of intervention subjects vs 20 % of controls used condoms, avoided genital intercourse, or knew their last partner had a <b>negative</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> test (P less than 0. 005). CONCLUSION. <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> testing combined with AIDS education increases concern about HIV and, {{at least in the short}} term, may promote safer sexual behaviors. Additional strategies will be necessary if behaviors risky for HIV transmission are to be further reduced...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{transmission}} of HIV most closely reflects {{the concentration of}} HIV in the genital tract; HIV in the genital tract of subjects with acute HIV and some “classical” STDS is 8 – 10 times greater than in control subjects. It seems likely that these latter subjects lead to spread of HIV. Accordingly, the state of North Carolina committed to HIV testing that detects subjects with acute, recent, and established infection. We tested 109, 500 samples over 9 months. We found 563 people with undiagnosed HIV infection. The majority of subjects were in STD clinics. This included 23 subjects with (pre-seroconversion) acute HIV infection (<b>HIV</b> RNA positive, <b>antibody</b> <b>negative).</b> The median blood HIV was 209, 000 copies/ml, more than 10 times higher than in subjects with established HIV infection. Recognizing the increased number of subjects with unrecognized acute HIV infection in STD clinics, we conducted similar studies in STD Clinics in Malawi and South Africa. Between 1 and 2 % of subjects had undetected acute HIV infection. The median viral burden in blood of subjects in Malawi was greater than 1, 000, 000 copies/ml. STDS and HIV are often co-transmitted, and STDS {{set the stage for}} subsequent HIV transmission. Prevention of sexual {{transmission of}} HIV likely requires maximal suppression of genital tract HIV viral burden, either through treatment of STDS or use of antiretroviral agents...|$|R
40|$|A 55 -year-old {{male with}} {{carcinoma}} in situ of urinary bladder was treated with weekly intravesical injections of Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine. Three days after the sixth injection, he developed low grade fever and multiple grouped punched out, 2 - 3 mm ulcers around meatus and corona glandis. In addition, multiple, firm, indurated, nontender papules and few deeper nodules were present on the proximal part of glans penis, along with bilateral enlarged, matted and nontender inguinal lymph nodes. There was no history suggestive of sexually transmitted diseases and high risk behavior. Chest X-ray was within normal limits, and Mantoux, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> tests were <b>negative.</b> The biopsy from the penile ulcer revealed epithelioid cell granuloma with Langhans giant cells. Fine needle aspiration cytology from the lymph node also revealed epithelioid cell granuloma and acid fast bacilli on Ziehl Neelsen&#x 2032;s stain. The tissue biopsy grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The BCG immunotherapy was stopped and patient was treated with four drug antitubercular therapy with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide in standard daily doses along with pyridoxine. The edema resolved and the ulcers started healing within 2 weeks, and at 6 weeks after starting antitubercular therapy almost complete healing occurred.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of behavioral intention to take up <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> testing in the next six months among Hong Kong MSM who were ever-testers. An anonymous cross-sectional survey recruited 326 MSM who had taken up <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> testing from gay-friendly venues and internet in Hong Kong. Of the participants, 40. 8 % had had unprotected anal intercourse with regular or non-regular male sex partners in the last six months; they were at risk of HIV transmission despite experience in <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> testing. Only 37. 2 % showed a strong intention to take up <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> testing again in the next six months. Adjusted analysis showed that both perceived discrimination toward Hong Kong MSM (AOR =. 60, 95 % CI:. 36 -. 98) and the CARE Measure assessing perceived empathy of service providers (AOR = 1. 05, 95 % CI: 1. 02 - 1. 08) were significantly associated with intention for retesting. Perceived discrimination, however, became statistically non-significant (AOR =. 68, 95 % CI:. 41 - 1. 14), when both CARE Measure and perceived discrimination entered into the adjusted model. It is warranted to increase HIV retesting rate by removing perceived discrimination and reducing the negative effect of perceived discrimination through enhancement of empathy of service providers...|$|R
