5|$|Carolina wrens {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their time on or near the ground searching for food, or in tangles of vegetation and vines. They also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels, or pick up leaf-litter in order to search for prey. Their diet consists of invertebrates, such as beetles, true bugs, grasshoppers, <b>katydids,</b> spiders, ants, bees, and wasps. Small lizards and tree frogs also make up the carnivorous portion of their diet. Vegetable matter makes up a small percentage of their diets, such as fruit pulp and various seeds. In the northern portion of their range, they frequent bird feeders.|$|E
5|$|In {{some very}} small insects, the venation may be greatly reduced. In Chalcidoidea (Chalcid wasps), for instance, only the subcosta {{and part of}} the radius are present. Conversely, an {{increase}} in venation may occur by the branching of existing veins to produce accessory veins or by the development of additional, intercalary veins between the original ones, as in the wings of Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets). Large numbers of cross-veins are present in some insects, and they may form a reticulum as in the wings of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and {{at the base of the}} forewings of Tettigonioidea and Acridoidea (<b>katydids</b> and grasshoppers respectively).|$|E
5|$|Small prey {{is usually}} torn into chunks and eaten {{completely}} including bones and fur, while prey {{larger than about}} 100g (4oz), such as baby rabbits, Cryptomys blesmols, or Otomys vlei rats, is usually dismembered and the inedible parts discarded. Contrary to what is sometimes assumed, the barn owl does not eat domestic animals on any sort of regular basis. Regionally, non-rodent foods are used as per availability. On bird-rich islands, a barn owl might include some fifteen to twenty percent of birds in its diet, while in grassland it will gorge itself on swarming termites, or on Orthoptera such as Copiphorinae <b>katydids,</b> Jerusalem crickets (Stenopelmatidae) or true crickets (Gryllidae). Bats and even frogs, lizards and snakes may make a minor but {{significant contribution to the}} diet; small Soricomorpha like Suncus shrews may be a secondary prey of major importance.|$|E
40|$|The {{dominant}} {{technology for}} developing AI applications {{is to work}} in a multi-mechanism, integrated, knowledge-based system (KBS) development environment. Unfortunately, systems developed in such environments are inappropriate for delivering many applications - most importantly, they carry the baggage of the entire Lisp environment and are not written in conventional languages. One resolution of this problem would be to compile applications from complex environments to conventional languages. Here the first efforts to develop a system for compiling KBS developed in KEE to Ada (trademark). This system is called <b>KATYDID,</b> for KEE/Ada Translation Yields Development Into Delivery. <b>KATYDID</b> includes early prototypes of a run-time KEE core (object-structure) library module for Ada, and translation mechanisms for knowledge structures, rules, and Lisp code to Ada. Using these tools, part of a simple expert system was compiled (not quite automatically) to run in a purely Ada environment. This experience has given us various insights on Ada as an artificial intelligence programming language, potential solutions of some of the engineering difficulties encountered in early work, and inspiration on future system development...|$|R
5000|$|This katydid {{is found}} mainly {{within the range}} of central Arizona to {{southern}} Montana and southern New York to southern Georgia within the United States, but is also found in parts of Mexico and Canada. They can commonly be found in dry grasslands and old fields with grasses. Their preferred habitat is that of open areas of short grass along roadsides and in pastures, and they are usually found in clumps of large numbers. The Straight-lanced Meadow <b>Katydid's</b> song is a faint purr at 10-20 kHz with a pulsating quality. [...] Adults first appear in the late summer, but they occur year-round.|$|R
5|$|Camouflage {{is the use}} of any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see (crypsis), or by disguising them as something else (mimesis). Examples include the leopard's spotted coat, the battledress of a modern soldier, and the leaf-mimic <b>katydid's</b> wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as chameleons and octopuses, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling.|$|R
25|$|<b>Katydids</b> {{have evolved}} {{a wide range}} of {{camouflage}} adaptations so their body colouring and shape match entire leaves, half-eaten leaves, dying leaves, leaves with bird droppings, sticks, twigs, and tree bark. Other well-known mimetic animals include beetles, mantids, caterpillars, moths, snakes, lizards, frogs, and fish.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species are}} cryptically colored to {{resemble}} their surroundings. For example, Uroplatus geckos can be almost completely invisible, {{even to a}} nearby observer. Similarly, the <b>katydids,</b> a group of grasshopper-like insects found worldwide, are nocturnal and use their cryptic coloration to remain unnoticed during the day. They remain perfectly still, often in a position that increases {{the effectiveness of their}} camouflage.|$|E
25|$|True crickets are insects of the Gryllidae, a {{cosmopolitan}} family of around 100 genera comprising some 800 species, {{belonging to the}} order Orthoptera. Crickets, like other Orthoptera (grasshoppers and <b>katydids),</b> are capable of producing high-pitched sound by stridulation. Crickets differ from other Orthoptera in four aspects: Crickets possess three-segmented tarsi and long antennae; their tympanum {{is located at the}} base of the front tibia; and the females have long, slender ovipositors.|$|E
40|$|In Aesop’s fable, the industrious ant {{works hard}} to {{stockpile}} food for the forthcoming winter whereas the improvident grasshopper spends all summer singing and so dies for lack of food when winter comes. Philosopher Bernard Suits appears to turn this cautionary tale on its head in his seminal work ‘The Grasshopper: Games, Life and Utopia’ (originally published in 1978 and reissued in 2005). His Grasshopper playfully engages disciples Skepticus and Prudence in a Socratic dialogue to address a number of riddles. One of these takes {{up most of the}} inner section of the book and is a riposte to Wittgenstein’s (1958) assertion that the concept of games cannot be defined. But that’s not all the book is about. Not only does it propose and defend a definition of games that can meet analytical philosophy’s requirement of necessary and sufficient conditions, it also considers the value of playing games – indeed, it seems to suggest that game-playing is the ultimate human good, the only thing that makes life worth living. Yet this presents a paradox. If, in Utopia, {{there is no need to}} work because everything is provided, then all that remains is playing games. However, this eventually becomes unsatisfactory so people begin to do unnecessary things that previously had instrumental value but are now carried out for their own sake (like building houses or solving scientific problems). This is the final riddle, according to Kolers (2014) : perhaps it is not that the good life consists in playing games, but that it is the life that is itself a game. These riddles and paradoxes turn on the question of value. In this piece, and with deep and sincere apologies to Suits, I appropriate his play frame and rearrange it in a way to suit the issue at hand: the state of play. Here, the interlocutors are descendants of the originals: <b>KATYDID</b> (a particularly noisy bush cricket) and two disciples: PRAGMATICUS (a play campaigner and practical realist) and LUTROTES (a leading light in the Save Children’s Play campaign). Glossing over the issue of defining play (for reasons that emerge), it explores the contradictions inherent in discussing play’s value and ends with a riddle that readers may or may not wish to attempt to solve...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only availableFaculty Mentor: Dr. Johannes Schul, BiologyNocturnally flying insects avoid {{predation}} by insectivorous bats by monitoring for echolocation calls and, when detected, using evasive behaviors. We {{examined the}} responses of Neoconocephalus retusus to models of bat calls during tethered flight. The bat calls were 8 ms in duration and frequency modulated (FM) from 80 to 35 kHz with the main energy concentrated at 40 kHz. Such calls resemble the search phase calls of the Big Brown Bat (Eptesicus fuscus), an insectivorous bat commonly found in Missouri. We simulated a bat in the search phase {{as if it were}} approaching the katydid to characterize the response types of N. retusus. At low amplitudes of the bat call, equivalent to a distance of approximately 24 m from the insect, N. retusus steered away from the sound source by extending one hind leg. At higher intensities (~ 20 m from the insect) the insect interrupted the beating of the hind wings while remaining in flight posture. At even higher bat call intensities, corresponding to approximately 15 m from the insect, flight stopped and the animal assumed a dive position: both sets of wings folded up, the antennae folded back, and all legs were placed flush against the abdomen. All three behaviors occur before a bat would be able to hear the <b>katydid's</b> echo. We used a series of 7 FM pulses of constant amplitude to determine the thresholds for the three behaviors. The thresholds for steering, interruption of flight and cessation of flight are 46. 5 dB SPL, 51 dB SPL, and 59. 5 dB SPL respectively. We also examined the thresholds using a single FM pulse in which the thresholds were approximately 5 - 6 dB higher. Bat avoidance in N. retusus differs strikingly from that of the closely related N. ensiger, which shows only a behavior equivalent to our interruption of wingbeat response, but no steering or dive behaviors. However, the avoidance behaviors of N. retusus were similar to those of a more distantly related katydid {{as well as those of}} crickets and some moths. Thus, bat evasive behavior might differ significantly among closely related species, but often shows convergence among distantly related groups. This suggests that such behaviors readily adapt to changing predation pressures rather than being conserved within phylogenic groups. Life Sciences Undergraduate Research Opportunity Progra...|$|R

Suzumushi is featured in an eponymous chapter of The Tale of Genji (1000–1008 A.D.) which, according to Hearn, {{is the oldest}} Japanese account of an insect hunt. Crickets and <b>katydids</b> (mushi) were the staple symbols of autumn in haiku poetry. The Western culture, unlike its Japanese counterpart, regards crickets as symbols of summer. American film producers routinely insert clips of cricket sounds to tell the audience that the action takes place in summer.|$|E

25|$|Regarding invertebrates, the {{burrowing}} owl seems {{less of a}} generalist. It is extremely fond of termites such as Termitidae, and Orthoptera such as Conocephalinae and Copiphorinae <b>katydids,</b> Jerusalem crickets (Stenopelmatidae) and true crickets (Gryllidae). Bothynus and Dichotomius anaglypticus scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae) were eaten far more often than even closely related species by many {{burrowing owl}}s across central São Paulo (Brazil). Similarly, {{it was noted that}} among scorpions Bothriuridae were much preferred, among spiders Lycosidae (wolf spiders), and among millipedes (Diplopoda) certain Diplocheta. Small ground beetles (Carabidae) are eaten in quantity, while larger ones are much less popular as burrowing owl food, perhaps due to the vigorous defense the large species can put up. Burrowing owls are also known to place the fecal matter of large herbivorous mammals around the outside of their burrows to attract dung beetles which are used to provide a steady source of food for the owls.|$|E
25|$|Of the {{estimated}} 200,000 animal species in Australia, about 96% are invertebrates. While {{the full extent}} of invertebrate diversity is uncertain, 90% of insects and molluscs are considered endemic. Invertebrates occupy many ecological niches and are important in all ecosystems as decomposers, pollinators, and food sources. The largest group of invertebrates is the insects, comprising 75% of Australia's known species of animals. The most diverse insect orders are the Coleoptera, with 28,200 species of beetles and weevils, the Lepidoptera with 20,816 species including butterflies and moths, and around 14,800 species of Hymenoptera, including the ants, bees and wasps. Order Diptera, which includes the flies and mosquitoes,comprises 7,786 species. Order Hemiptera, including bugs, aphids and hoppers, comprises 5,650 species; and there are 2,827 species of order Orthoptera, including grasshoppers, crickets and <b>katydids.</b> Introduced species that pose a significant threat to native species include the European wasp, the red fire ant, the yellow crazy ant and feral honeybees which compete with native bees.|$|E

[...] The phylogeny of the Caelifera, based on mitochondrial ribosomal RNA of thirty-two taxa in six out of seven superfamilies, is shown as a cladogram. The Ensifera, Caelifera and all the superfamilies of grasshoppers except Pamphagoidea appear to be monophyletic.|$|E
500|$|The jay’s nest is {{typically}} built [...] {{above the ground}} next to a tree trunk. The base of the azure-hooded jay's first studied nest was coarsely made out of twigs that were [...] long. That nest was about [...] wide inside and [...] wide overall depending {{on the length of}} the exterior twigs. The nest is [...] deep and has an interior constructed with woven thin fibrils and twigs, and no feathers or other softening devices are used in the nest’s construction. In addition to building its own nest, this jay is known to reuse old, abandoned nests made by other species. Three to four eggs are normally laid. The young are typically raised in the nest between April and June and they take at least 20days to fledge. Both parents care for the young and feed them a variety of insects, including <b>katydids.</b> After the young fledge, they stay close to their parents.|$|E
500|$|The species {{acts as an}} {{important}} seed disperser and pollinator, {{as well as a}} prey item for several carnivores. [...] The Bengal slow loris feeds on plant exudates such as sap, gums, resins, and latexes, particularly those from the family Fabaceae. Even though the species does not have keeled nails, it will scrape the plant, actively breaking its surface; this behavior resembles that of marmosets and the fork-marked lemurs. Exudates are also obtained by gouging holes in the bark. The winter food supply consists almost entirely of plant exudates. The bastard myrobala (Terminalia belerica), a deciduous tree common in Southeast Asia, is a preferred source for exudates, but it has also been observed taking plant exudates from a number of families: Moraceae (Artocarpus), Magnoliaceae (Manglietia), Fabaceae (Acacia, Bauhinia), Lecythidaceae (Careya arborea), and Sterculiaceae (Pterospermum). Although it will feed on large insects (such as <b>katydids</b> and crickets), gum, snails, small birds, and reptiles, it is primarily frugivorous. Lianas of the flowering plant genus Bauhinia are a commonly used food source.|$|E

60|$|She {{hurried down}} the stairs and out into the {{fragrant}} night. The <b>katydids</b> were singing in infinite peace under the solemn splendor of the moon.

She saw and felt little of the external as she sat there.
