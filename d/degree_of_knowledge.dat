Although wild grapes of the Vitis genus could be found throughout the known world and all could be fermented, it took some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> and skill to turn these grapes into palatable wine. This knowledge was passed along the trading routes {{that emerged from the}} Caucasus and Zagros Mountains down through Mesopotamia and to the Mediterranean, eventually reaching Phoenicia. Specific varieties of grapevines of the V. vinifera species were identified as especially favorable for winemaking, cuttings of which were spread via these trade routes.|$|E

After attaining a certain <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the group's doctrines, members were allowed to adopt the surname [...] "Allah" [...] and sometimes [...] "God" [...] as a first name. This was in recognition of Clarence13X's teachings that black men were gods, and that each member should worship himself. His followers often took the name Allah, but would refrain from referring to themselves as such in his presence, in deference to his authority. After a decision (Pate v.

500|$|Stating in her preface that [...] "my main {{argument}} {{is built on}} this simple principle, that if [...] be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all", Wollstonecraft contends that society will degenerate without educated women, particularly because mothers are the primary educators of young children. She attributes the problem of uneducated women to men and [...] "a false system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men who [...] females rather as women than human creatures". Women are capable of rationality; it only appears that they are not, because men have refused to educate them and encouraged them to be frivolous (Wollstonecraft describes silly women as [...] "spaniels" [...] and [...] "toys"). While stressing it is of the same kind, she entertains the notion that women {{might not be able}} to attain the same <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> that men do.|$|E

2500|$|Situation {{awareness}} involves {{being aware}} {{of what is happening}} in the vicinity to understand how information, events, and one's own actions will impact goals and objectives, both immediately and in the near future. One with an adept sense of situation awareness generally has a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> with respect to inputs and outputs of a system, an innate [...] "feel" [...] for situations, people, and events that play out because of variables the subject can control. Lacking or inadequate situation awareness has been identified as one of the primary factors in accidents attributed to human error. Thus, situation awareness is especially important in work environments where the information flow can be quite high and poor decisions may lead to serious consequences (such as piloting an airplane, functioning as a soldier, or treating critically ill or injured patients).|$|E
2500|$|The first {{specialized}} training {{began in}} the mid-15th century, when certain samurai families started to focus on covert warfare, including espionage and assassination. Like the samurai, ninja were born into the profession, where traditions were kept in, and passed down through the family. According to Turnbull, the ninja was trained from childhood, as was also common in samurai families. Outside the expected martial art disciplines, a youth studied survival and scouting techniques, {{as well as information}} regarding poisons and explosives. Physical training was also important, which involved long distance runs, climbing, stealth methods of walking and swimming. A certain <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> regarding common professions was also required if one was expected to take their form in disguise. Some evidence of medical training can be derived from one account, where an Iga ninja provided first-aid to Ii Naomasa, who was injured by gunfire in the Battle of Sekigahara. Here the ninja reportedly gave Naomasa a [...] "black medicine" [...] meant to stop bleeding.|$|E

2500|$|While {{pursuing}} {{his studies}} in Shiraz Ubayd {{became one of}} the most accomplished men of letters and learning of his time, acquiring complete proficiency in every art, and compiling books and treatises on them. He subsequently returned to Qazvin, where he had the honour of being appointed to a judgeship and was chosen as the tutor and teacher of sundry young gentlemen. At that time the Turks in Persia had left no prohibited or vicious act undone, and the character of the Persian people, by reasons of association and intercourse with them, had become so changed and corrupted that Ubayd Zakani, disgusted at the contemplation thereof, sought by every means to make known and bring home to them the true conditions of affairs. Therefore, as an example of the corrupt morals of the age and its people, he composed the treatise known as Akhlaq-i Ashraf [...] "Ethics of the Aristocracy", which was not intended as mere ribaldry, but as a satire containing serious reflections and wise warnings. So, likewise, in order to depict the level of intelligence and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the leading men of Qazwin each one of whom was a mass of stupidity and ignorance, he included in his Risala-i Dilqusha [...] "Joyous Treatise" [...] many anecdotes of which each contains a lesson for persons of discernment.|$|E
2500|$|Stock speculators {{and investors}} usually need a stock broker {{such as a}} bank or a {{brokerage}} firm to access the stock market. [...] Since the advent of Internet banking, an Internet connection is commonly used to manage positions. Using the Internet, specialized software, and a personal computer, stock speculators/investors make use of technical and fundamental analysis to help them in making decisions. They may use several information resources, {{some of which are}} strictly technical. Using the pivot points calculated from a previous day's trading, they attempt to predict the buy and sell points of the current day's trading session. These points give a cue to speculators, as to where prices will head for the day, prompting each speculator where to enter his trade, and where to exit. An added tool for the stock picker is the use of [...] "stock screens". Stock screens allow the user to input specific parameters, based on technical and/or fundamental conditions, that he or she deems desirable. Primary benefit associated with stock screens is its ability to return a small group of stocks for further analysis, among tens of thousands, that fit the requirements requested. There is criticism on the validity of using these technical indicators in analysis, and many professional stock speculators do not use them. Many full-time stock speculators and stock investors, as well as most other people in finance, traditionally have a formal education and training in fields such as economics, finance, mathematics and computer science, which may be particularly relevant to this occupation – since stock trading is not an exact science, stock prices have in general a random or chaotic behaviour and there is no proven technique for trading stocks profitably, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> in those fields is ultimately neglectable.|$|E

30|$|To {{study the}} co-invention network created by an Italian {{academic}} inventor in the chemistry science sector, {{we follow the}} approach of Capellari and De Stefano (2013, 2014). In particular, we include inventors and assignees in the network, even if they belong to different “levels” of analysis, accounting for both the ownership and the individual levels embedded in each patent. 4 In this way, we introduce, in the analysis, the information on relationships among inventors and between inventors and organisations (as assignees). Consequently, in such a network, we can identify different types of links that may convey different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> transfer—from patenting activity—between actors: (i) co-invention: inventor-inventor link (I); (ii) co-assignment: assignee-assignee link 5 (A); and (iii) observed cross-level link: inventor-assignee link.

A certain <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> of its uses, action, and objects, was indispensable to a due exercise of the suffrage; {{not that it was}} required every elector should be learned in the theory of governments, but that he should know enough to understand the general connexion between his vote and his interests, and especially his rights. This knowledge was not at all difficult of attainment, in ordinary cases, when one had the means of coming at facts. In cases that admit of argument, as in all the questions on political economy, I did not see that any reasonable <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> made the matter much better, the cleverest men usually ranging themselves on the two extremes of all mooted questions.
