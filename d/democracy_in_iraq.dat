However, he soon became a critic. In addition to objecting to the war plan, he frequently criticized the way the Bush administration was running the occupation of Iraq. He argued against the disbanding of the army and bureaucracy yet supported the de-Baathification programs. He continued to argue that a functioning <b>democracy</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> would be a powerful new model for Arab politics but suggested that an honest accounting {{would have to say that}} the costs of the invasion had been much higher than the benefits. He opposed the Iraq surge in March 2007, writing that it would work militarily but not politically, still leaving Iraq divided among its three communities. Instead he advocated that Washington push hard for a political settlement between the Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, and Kurds, and begin a reduction in forces to only 60,000 troops. He later wrote that the surge [...] "succeeded" [...] militarily but that it did not produce a political compact and that Iraq remains divided along sectarian lines, undermining its unity, democracy, and legacy.|$|E

ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF ERIC SHINSEKI TO SPEAK ON SECURITY CHALLENGES FACING POST-CONFLICT DEMOCRACIES AT UGA CONFERENCE ATHENS, Ga. – In a rare public {{speaking}} appearance, former U. S. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki {{will address the}} security challenges facing post-conflict <b>democracies</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and Afghanistan at a conference {{to be held at}} the University of Georgia on April 16. Shinseki was the first commanding general of NATO peacekeepers in Bosnia. He served in this capacity from 1995 to 1998 and {{played a key role in}} developing the United States’ strategy to stabilize post-conflict democracies worldwide. He served as our country’s Army chief of staff during the recent wars and post-war efforts <b>in</b> Afghanistan and <b>Iraq.</b> <b>In</b> February 2003, he testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee that securing post-war Iraq would require a peacekeeping force of “several hundred thousand” soldiers. U. S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz commented at the time that Shinseki’s predictions were “wildly off the mark. ” Since his retirement in the summer of 2003, Shinseki has turned down all interview requests from national and international media, including the Sunday morning political talk show circuit. This will be Shinseki’s first {{public speaking}} engagement relating to these matters since his retirement. The conference, From Autocracy to Democracy: the Effort to Establish Market <b>Democracies</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and Afghanistan, will provide a comprehensive analysis of the legal, political, economic and security issues facing post-war Iraq and Afghanistan. It will start at 9 : 00 a. m. and conclude at 6 : 00 p. m. The conference’s keynote address, to be delivered by Shinseki, will begin at 11 : 00 a. m. in the UGA Chapel. Other speakers at the conference will include: Establishing the Rule of Law Panel · Rosa Ehrenreich Brooks, University of Virginia School of Law, will discuss post-war legal development <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b> · Scott Carlson, U. S. Sentencing Commission, will discuss post-conflict conciliation and criminal justice. · Mariam Nawabi, Embassy of Afghanistan, will address post-war legal development in Afghanistan. Luncheon Speaker Capt. Travis Hall, U. S. Army Judge Advocate General Corps and Iraq Justice Ministry, will provide a ground-level perspective of the challenges facing post-conflict justice <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b> Building the Institutions of the Nation Panel · Louis Aucoin, Tufts University Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, who is spearheading a comparative analysis of various nations’ constitution-writing efforts commissioned by the U. S. Institute of Peace, will speak on constitution-writing in post-conflict societies. · Ambassador Karl Inderfurth, the former U. S. assistant secretary of state for south Asian affairs, will discuss the specific challenges of establishing free and transparent governmental institutions <b>in</b> Afghanistan and <b>Iraq.</b> · Howard Wiarda, UGA School of Public and International Affairs, will discuss the fundamentals of nation-building. The Development of a Market Democracy Panel · Keith Crane, RAND Corporation and Coalition Provisional Authority <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> will speak on economic development <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and Afghanistan. · Timothy Mills, Iraq/Afghan Practice Group of Patton Boggs LLP, will discuss doing business <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and Afghanistan. · Lee Reed, UGA Terry College of Business, will discuss the importance of property rights in the establishment of market democracies.

When the recent developments considered, Iraq {{may be the most}} striking example of this variability. In this context, with the intervention made in 2003 and the closure of the Saddam era, Iraq has a new constitution and Iraqi people have new “rights and liberties”. Post-Saddam era brought hope for some groups <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> while rage for others: Hope especially for Shiites and Kurds who could not find fair representation for years and suffered from oppressive policies of Saddam; but, rage mostly for Sunni Arab tribes who had close ties with Saddam regime and for ex-Baathists and military elites who lost their posts and social status {{with the collapse of the}} regime. Also it is certain that the new era still contains ambiguities and state of chaos and disorder prevail. This study analyzes democracy culture and practice of Iraq through comparison of Saddam and post-Saddam era and arrives at some predictions for the future of <b>Iraq.</b> <b>In</b> the aftermath of the intervention, Iraq could not establish a stable political structure; thus, the study will try to answer the question of “Can artificial solutions bring practical gains? ” by regarding general characteristics and background of <b>democracy</b> culture <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> with a special focus o...|$|R

Yet it is also pretentious because of the impressive volume of academic work about Iraq that has appeared during the last four years.

Keeping those concerns in mind, this paper establishes a discursive trajectory across all these topics.

50|$|Kurdish leaders <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> {{have pushed}} for the {{prosperity}} of divided local governments rather than an independent state; this is because leadership is derived from tribal legitimacy, rather than political institutions.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the role of agency during {{political}} transition processes in divided societies. To be more specific, it examines how the Iraqi political elites view democracy and what type of political institutions they support. The years between 2012 and 2015 are of great significance and the final US withdrawal {{at the beginning of the}} period marked the conclusion of military occupation. That event made the Iraqi political elite central to the political process. Previous studies have focused on structural issues <b>in</b> post invasion <b>Iraq,</b> highlighting factors that could facilitate democracy or systems that could undermine prospects for a democratic system in the country. A gap in the literature on Iraq is identifiable as there is a lack of any real attention to the issue of agency. The theoretical contribution of this study is that it illustrates and underlines the importance of elite perspectives for the democratisation process in a country divided along ethno-religious lines. The study argues that democratic institutional arrangements are needed as the means to reconcile different, and at times conflicting, political interests. Having established this point, the research analyses the role of agency in terms of key political players in forming, arranging, and setting up institutions. Extensive field research collating original empirical data was carried out <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> Baghdad and Erbil, from 2011 to 2015. This study surveys the Iraqi House of Representatives, the Iraqi Presidency, and the Iraqi Council of Ministers, and involves interviews with highly placed decision makers in the executive, the legislative and the judiciary, as well as members of the Constitution Drafting Committee. Key participants include; the President and the Prime Minister, Speakers of the Parliament, and the Chair of Iraqi Constitution Drafting Committee. The participants include members from all the main ethno-religious groups in this divided country. Based on this new data, the specific views of Iraq's political elites are analysed, and their preferred types of political system are articulated, providing a concise contribution to current knowledge of <b>democracy</b> building <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b> The first empirical finding is that elites of the minority groups conceive democracy as power sharing, while members of the majority understand it as majority rule. The second finding is that larger groups support majoritarian institutions, while smaller groups support consensual ones. Those findings confirm previous academic thinking, for example Lijphart's theory on consensus democracy. The third finding is more surprising. All groups support a consensual arrangement of federalism and a majoritarian constitution. This unexpected support for these types of institutional arrangements required investigation in more depth to determine how political elites view federalism <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> and how the constitution, if the opportunity arose, might be amended. It is argued that the future possibilities of Iraq’s polity depend largely on political agreements between the political elites representing the main groups <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b> The stability of the country rests mainly on the ability of its elites to arrange political institutions in such a way as to accommodate the different interests of the groups they represent...|$|R

25|$|After the {{terrorist}} attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. government officials questioned the lack of large-scale American <b>democracy</b> promotion mechanisms <b>in</b> the MENA region, viewing democracy as a means of promoting moderation and stability and preventing terrorism.

40|$|Given {{the ongoing}} {{political}} turbulence worldwide, {{it is more}} than necessary for us to reconsider the question of democracy. This question has been posed by French philosopher Claude Lefort for many years, but it has assumed a renewed urgency. Although <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> the first danger of democracy, totalitarian dictatorship, was tackled, the liberators clearly had not thought about the other risk when dealing with democracy: the complete implosion of society into a pure formless collection of atomic individuals. Since democracy is a particular political regime, Lefort says, it comes down to understand the formal differences between totalitarianism and <b>democracy.</b> <b>In</b> <b>democracy</b> the place of power is symbolically empty; this place of power can be refigured into a totalitarian power, but can also be actually empty, when a regime falls apart into factions and fractions, all fighting for their own interests and idea(l) s. It is therefore not sufficient to bring democracy by dethroning the king. Although the source of legitimacy in a democratic regime is the people, the people remains indeterminate. This indeterminacy and thus also vulnerability is a core principle of <b>democracy</b> <b>in</b> Leforts theory. Ultimately, the craziness of <b>democracy</b> lies <b>in</b> its vulnerability...|$|R
