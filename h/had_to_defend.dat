5|$|By November 1944, Strong was {{reporting}} {{that there was}} a possibility of a German counteroffensive in the Ardennes or the Vosges. Smith sent Strong to personally warn Bradley, who was preparing an offensive of his own. The magnitude and ferocity of the German Ardennes Offensive came as a shock, and Smith <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> Strong against criticism for failing to sound the alarm. He felt Bradley had been given ample warning.|$|E
5|$|Like other minks, {{individual}} sea minks {{may have}} maintained home ranges, and, since the males were larger and required more food, males {{would have had}} larger territorial claims. Likewise, their larger size may have allowed the males to target larger prey than the females, {{and they may have}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> females during mating seasons. Like other weasels, the sea mink was probably polygynandrous, with both sexes mating with multiple individuals.|$|E

5|$|Several {{days later}} the NZMRB {{was moved to the}} south to support the 2nd Light Horse Brigade at Ziza. The light-horsemen had taken the {{surrender}} of a large Turkish force, part of the Turkish Fourth Army, then <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> them from the Arab tribesmen. When the brigade arrived the Australian and Turkish troops, who were still armed, were holding a perimeter facing the Arab force. The brigade's appearance resolved the situation and the Turkish troops surrendered.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack of}} Alexios's {{division}} initially caught Bryennios's men off guard, but, being veteran troops, they soon recovered {{and once again}} began to push it back. Retreating, Alexios's troops, and especially the Turks, employed skirmishing tactics, attacking the enemy line and then withdrawing swiftly, thus keeping their opponents at bay and weakening the coherence of their line. Some among Alexios's men chose to attack Bryennios, and the rebel general <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> against several attacks himself.|$|E
5|$|Freema Agyeman, {{who played}} Martha Jones in Doctor Who and Torchwood, {{introduced}} the episode, which was shown {{on a large}} screen above the stage and smaller screens {{around the edge of}} the Dress Circle in the Royal Albert Hall. As the Doctor addressed them, the Royal Albert Hall audience shouted back responses. Manuscript paper fell to the stage as the Doctor was seen to feed his sheet music to the orchestra. When the Graske sneaked through the portal, he appeared in the audience carrying the Doctor's water pistol and squirting members of the audience. A cellist <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> himself from an attack by the Graske who promptly exited as, on screen, the Doctor pulled him back to the TARDIS. The Graske in the audience was Jimmy Vee in costume and prosthetics.|$|E

5|$|Newly crowned TNA X Division Champion, A.J. Styles, went on {{to defend}} his {{championship}} against Christopher Daniels in a 30-minute Iron Man match at Against All Odds. Styles <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> the championship against Daniels at the event as per a pre-match stipulation to their bout on the January 21 episode of Impact!, in which if Styles failed to defeat Daniels in under 10 minutes, {{then he would have}} to give Daniels a title shot. Styles failed to win the contest in under ten minutes, which granted Daniels a title match. Dusty Rhodes then made the match a 30-minute Iron Man match. Styles {{went on to}} defeat Daniels at Against All Odds 2 to 1 in falls during over-time.|$|E
5|$|No {{drawings}} or {{paintings of}} Sherwood exist, but contemporary accounts describe her as attractive and tall and possessing {{a sense of}} humor. Sherwood wore trousers instead of a dress while working on her farm. This was unusual for the time, as was her herb growing. The combination of clothing and good looks was said to attract men and upset their wives. Sherwood biographer and advocate Belinda Nash suggests that Sherwood's neighbors may have been jealous of Sherwood, and that the witchcraft tales may have been conjured up {{in an effort to}} remove her from, and subsequently get, her property. Sherwood was a party to at least a dozen lawsuits, in which she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> against accusations of witchcraft, or in which she sued her accusers for slander.|$|E
5|$|While Adams {{tried to}} reassert {{control of the}} meeting, people poured out of the Old South Meeting House and headed to Boston Harbor. That evening, a group of 30 to 130 men boarded the three vessels, some of them thinly {{disguised}} as Mohawk Indians, and dumped all 342 chests of tea into the water {{over the course of}} three hours. Adams never revealed whether he went to the wharf to witness the destruction of the tea. Whether or not he helped plan the event is unknown, but Adams immediately worked to publicize and defend it. He argued that the Tea Party was not the act of a lawless mob, but was instead a principled protest and the only remaining option that the people <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> their constitutional rights.|$|E

5|$|At the 2006 Royal Rumble, Helms {{participated in}} an Open Invitational match for the Cruiserweight Championship and won, {{even though he was}} a Raw superstar and the {{championship}} was defended solely on SmackDown!. As a result, he returned to the SmackDown! brand in February 2006 to start a feud with Nunzio, Kid Kash and the other cruiserweights. During this time, Helms defeated Nunzio in a one-on-one match. The next week, he was supposed to defend against Kid Kash, but Kash was away on a family emergency, so Scotty 2 Hotty took his place. Helms defeated him and declared that he was better than all the other cruiserweights. As a result, all the cruiserweights at the show invaded the ring and attacked Helms. It was later announced by SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long that at the No Way Out pay-per-view event, Helms would face all the cruiserweights in a match for the title. Helms was able to retain the championship. Later, Long mandated that Helms <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> his title against a cruiserweight each week on SmackDown! to prove that he truly was better than all the cruiserweights. Helm's first defense under this new rule was against Psicosis of The Mexicools; Helms retained by cheating.|$|E
5|$|Dannatt was {{appointed}} Chief of the General Staff (CGS) in August 2006, succeeding General Sir Mike Jackson. Dannatt faced controversy over his outspokenness, in particular his calls for improved pay and conditions for soldiers {{and for a}} drawdown of operations in Iraq {{in order to better}} man those in Afghanistan. He also set about trying to increase his public profile, worried that he was not recognisable enough {{at a time when he}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> the Army's reputation against alleged prisoner abuse in Iraq. He later assisted with the formation of Help for Heroes to fund a swimming pool at Headley Court and, later in his tenure, brokered an agreement with the British press that allowed Prince Harry to serve in Afghanistan. He was succeeded as CGS by Sir David Richards and retired in 2009, taking up the largely honorary post of Constable of the Tower of London, which he held until July 2016.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not easy}} to assess the {{importance}} of the Byzantine navy to the Empire's history. On one hand, the Empire, throughout its life, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> a long coastline, often with little hinterland. In addition, shipping was always the quickest and cheapest way of transport, and the Empire's major urban and commercial centres, as well as most of its fertile areas, lay close to the sea. Coupled with the threat posed by the Arabs in the 7th to 10th centuries, this necessitated the maintenance of a strong fleet. The navy was perhaps at its most significant in the successful defence of Constantinople from the two Arab sieges, which ultimately saved the Empire. Throughout the period however, naval operations were {{an essential part of the}} Byzantine effort against the Arabs in a game of raids and counter-raids that continued up to the late 10th century.|$|E

[...] Colin Murray, Fighting Talk's Big Day Out, Saturday 1st June 2013 For all the responses are often outrageously comedic, due to some being extremely near the knuckle, hosts <b>have</b> still <b>had</b> <b>to</b> reiterate on many occasions that the statements are not meant to be taken seriously in any way. Indeed, more often than not they actually have the intention of mocking those who would hold such an abhorrent view; even so, despite repeated clarification, complaints are still a fairly regular occurrence.|$|R

5|$|On the October 11, 2004 {{edition of}} Raw, La Résistance <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> the World Tag Team Championship in a match with Eugene and William Regal. Regal hit Sylvain Grenier {{with a pair}} of brass {{knuckles}} and pinned him to win the World Tag Team title. Eric Bischoff, however, restarted the match. The match resulted in La Résistance retaining the title, after Robért Conway jabbed Regal in the side with a flagpole. Bischoff informed La Résistance that at Taboo Tuesday they were scheduled to defend the World Tag Team title against the two individuals who were not chosen to face Triple H for the World title. Shawn Michaels won the fans choice, which gave Edge and Chris Benoit a World Tag Team title match. Edge, however, abandoned Benoit during the match, which forced Benoit to wrestle both members of La Résistance by himself. Despite this, Benoit managed to force Conway to submit to the Crippler Crossface to win the World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the brigade}} arrived, {{many of the}} Germans around the drop zone withdrew or offered no further resistance. The first unit on the ground, 10 Para, {{attacked}} and destroyed the Dutch SS Wachbattalion while Brigadier Hackett personally captured ten Germans shortly after landing. When Hackett arrived at brigade headquarters, he was informed by Lieutenant Colonel Mckenzie of the division's staff about the change in plans, explaining that 11 Para was to be detached from his brigade to support the push into Arnhem. At {{the same time the}} KOSB, until then responsible for defending the northern side of the landing grounds, were attached to 4th Parachute Brigade to replace 11 Para. Meanwhile, the KOSB still <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> landing-zone 'L', to protect gliders arriving on day three. While Hackett formulated a new plan, Mckenzie returned to divisional headquarters, to be informed on his arrival that 60 German tanks were approaching Arnhem from the north. Transport aircraft passing over occupied channel ports had confirmed German suspicions of a second lift such {{that they were able to}} give their troops at Arnhem forty-five minutes advance notice of the allies' arrival. Prepared in advance for such an eventuality, a Waffen SS mobile unit had been dispatched towards the likely landing grounds.|$|E
5|$|Upon the title's creation, CZW {{recognized}} Derek Domino as {{the first}} CZW Iron Man Champion on February 13, 1999 at their Opening Night event. Domino immediately <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> the title that night against Lobo, {{who went on to}} win the match and the championship. On June 10, 2000 at CZW's Caged To The End event, Mad Man Pondo defeated Wifebeater to win the championship. However, on July 22, 2000 at CZW's No Rules, No Limits event, Wifebeater was awarded the championship without facing Pondo in a match for unknown reasons. Instead, that night Wifebeater defended the title against Nick Gage, who {{went on to win the}} title. During Lobo's third reign CZW held their Breakaway Brawl show on June 9, 2001. A Triple Threat Deathmatch for the CZW Iron Man Championship occurred involving Nick Mondo, Wifebeater, and Mad Man Pondo, which Mondo won to become champion. Lobo was not involved due to a broken leg injury he sustained from the night before.|$|E
