40|$|This section {{investigates the}} {{interrelation}} between economic dynamics and the structural change of production. The importance of structural change, flexibility, {{and a quick}} reaction to new challenges facing growth, welfare and competitiveness {{seems to be a}} foregone conclusion explicitly or implicitly present in the statements of politicians, managers and experts and often, of such organisations as the OECD, the European Commission, the World Economic Forum, Lehman Brothers, etc. Economics presents several arguments explaining not only why growth will be easier to achieve if structures do change, but also why structures have to change if incomes change. This two-way causality prevents the falsification (and of course also the scientific support) of the hypothesis, since tests for significance become very difficult under these circumstances. The result is that the relation between structural change and growth seems to be under-researched relative to its alleged <b>importance.</b> One <b>indication</b> of this is, that from the large number of studies conducted for the OECD Growth Project, very few relate to structural changes and their impact on growth.

The occupation has supported many facets and the following aspects: framework for the integration of the young, labour market regulator, basis for emancipation, core of identification for social and personal classification, space for fulfilling tasks and duties, element of social stability. In the past few decades these aspects have occurred to a large extent in stable core workforces in which further allocation mechanisms were available through the employer. The disintegration of these stable conditions in post-industrial society is often interpreted to the effect that along with this development the occupation, too, is losing <b>importance.</b> <b>Indications</b> cited for the permanence of the occupation being endangered are that occupational identity is being subordinated to other fields of identification, that vocational training and occupation are becoming separated from one another, that vocational training is splitting up and is therefore no longer suitable for a clear identification, that unclear job details are a sign of the fading possibility of occupational allocation, and that flexibility prohibits narrow differentiation of occupations. In the analysis of future working worlds segments can be imagined, some of which continue to be centred around an enterprise, and in which the reference to the occupation, though useful - in particular for new entrants to the workforce -, is not absolutely necessary, whereas new identification patterns are needed for other segments because of the loss of this enterprise connection.

Use of different reference schemes between studies may contribute, among other factors, to inconsistencies of findings (Hagemann, 1998).

The CAEPs were recorded to natural speech tokens presented as auditory, visual and audiovisual stimuli.

"The next {{point to}} be {{regarded}} {{was a matter of}} far greater <b>importance.</b> From <b>indications</b> afforded by the barometer, we find that, in ascensions {{from the surface of the}} earth we have, at the height of 1,000 feet, left below us about one-thirtieth of the entire mass of atmospheric air, that at 10,600 we have ascended through nearly one-third; and that at 18,000, which is not far from the elevation of Cotopaxi, we have surmounted one-half the material, or, at all events, one-half the ponderable, body of air incumbent upon our globe. It is also calculated that at an altitude not exceeding the hundredth part of the earth's diameter--that is, not exceeding eighty miles--the rarefaction would be so excessive that animal life could in no manner be sustained, and, moreover, that the most delicate means we possess of ascertaining the presence of the atmosphere would be inadequate to assure us of its existence. But I did not fail to perceive that these latter calculations are founded altogether on our experimental knowledge of the properties of air, and the mechanical laws regulating its dilation and compression, in what may be called, comparatively speaking, the immediate vicinity of the earth itself; and, at the same time, it is taken for granted that animal life is and must be essentially incapable of modification at any given unattainable distance from the surface. Now, all such reasoning and from such data must, of course, be simply analogical. The greatest height ever reached by man was that of 25,000 feet, attained in the aeronautic expedition of Messieurs Gay-Lussac and Biot. This is a moderate altitude, even when compared with the eighty miles in question; and I could not help thinking that the subject admitted room for doubt and great latitude for speculation.|$|R

The retrospective study included all patients who underwent impacted third molars extraction from January 2008 until December 2011. 7659 third molars were extracted for 2112 patients. Postoperative complications were retrieved from medical files. Results. No complications were related to general anesthesia. The most frequent postoperative complication was infection (7. 15 %). Lingual nerve injuries affected 1. 8 % of the patients. All of them were transient and were not related to tooth section. Inferior alveolar nerve injuries were reported in 0. 4 % of the cases. 95. 8 % of these patients were admitted for one-day ambulatory care, and only two patients were readmitted after discharge from hospital.

Geographical indications for coffee have emerged only recently, {{and only a few}} scientific studies have been carried out on this topic so far.

The aim of this analysis is to investigate the influence of the region of origin on the achieved auction price of Honduran specialty coffee, controlling for other coffee attributes. The results indicate that coffees from the region Marcala, for which a denomination of origin was established in 2005, possess on average a higher quality than coffees grown in other Honduran regions. Consequently, since quality is the most important price determinant in the internet auctions, coffees from Marcala achieve on average a higher price than coffees from other Honduran coffee-growing regions. However, the hypothesis that Marcala coffees can also achieve a higher price due to an already established reputation could not be confirmed.

This papers addresses the following factors with respect to multilingual stroke patients: the age of acquisition of languages, the place of lesion, the language proficiency {{at the time of the}} stroke and its recovery during post-stroke training, the speaker’s emotional involvement with the languages and the relative distance between languages. The age of acquisition of languages appears to be of lower importance, and multilingual language recovery of patients with Broca’s area stroke is more complex than that of bilingual patients. Importantly, the languages used prior to the lesion, and the language used during language therapy are highly relevant. Closely linked is the emotional involvement with the various languages in a multilingual person; the deeper the integrative motivation, the more successful the recovery. From a linguistic point of view, the relative distance between languages appears to be of lower <b>importance</b> despite some <b>indications</b> put forward by neurolinguists and clinicians.

It {{is also a}} notoriously difficult problem, tackled by many scientists with various methods. In this paper, we formulate GRN inference as a sparse regression problem. We decompose the prediction of a p-genes system in p different regression problems. For each gene (target gene), we train a kernel-based regression with feature selection, predicting the expression pattern of the target gene using all the other genes (input genes). The regression will give the importance of each input gene in the prediction of the target gene. We take this <b>importance</b> as an <b>indication</b> of a putative regulatory link. Putative links are then aggregated over all genes to provide a ranking of interactions, from which we infer the GRN. Furthermore, biological data are heterogeneous.

Finally, we compare our method, called LocKING, to state-of-the-art methods on real and realistic datasets, which are widely spread in the GRN inference community.

40|$|In a {{prospective}} study, 23 consecutive girls with Rett syndrome and neuromuscular scoliosis were evaluated for functioning at a long-term follow-up. The patients had mostly improved, which {{was confirmed by}} their parents. Rett syndrome is associated with neuromuscular scoliosis and has a typically long C-shaped thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis. Prospective long-term follow-up studies related to these patients total situation are sparse. Most studies focus on the Cobb angle of the scoliosis, whereas parents are mainly concerned about the girls continued functioning. Twenty-three patients with Rett syndrome and neuromuscular scoliosis were evaluated preoperatively from 1993 to 2002. At follow-up, 19 patients remained in the study. Three patients died (not due to surgery), and one patient could not participate {{because it was too}} far to travel. Mean follow-up time was 74 months (range 49 - 99 months). The assessments comprised the sitting balance, seating supports in wheelchair, weight distribution, time used for rest, care given, and angle of scoliosis. Follow-up questionnaires and two-open-ended questions about the positive and negative effects of surgery were sent to parents. Sitting balance, number of seating supports in wheelchair, weight distribution, time used for rest, and the Cobb angle had all improved after surgery. The parents assessed improvement in seating position, daily activities, time used for rest, and cosmetic appearance. We can conclude that the stabilized spine resulted in sufficient strength to keep the body upright with the possibility of looking around at the surroundings more easily. The girls got better seating position with less need for seating adaptations in the wheelchair and with reduced time needed for resting during the day. Finally we can conclude that the indication for surgery is to get a better posture which lead to less risk of pressure sores, and that un upright position lead to better possibility to easily breath with fewer episodes of pneumonia and a better general health as result. The evidence of positive surgical effects for girls with Rett syndrome is of great <b>importance</b> in <b>indication</b> for surgery in the decision-making process.

The objectives of this study were (a) to determine if cytoplasmic effects occurred in reciprocal interspecific matings, (b) to assess whether backcrossing to the cultivated parent influenced cytoplasm effects, and (c) to determine if there were specific nuclear x cytoplasmic interactions;Sixty populations of 20 oat lines each, representing the BC(, 0), BC(, 1), and BC(, 2) of the matings among five A. sterilis accessions and two A. sativa cultivars with reciprocals, were evaluated in a field-grown experiment for grain yield, straw yield, harvest index, heading date, plant height, unit straw weight, and vegetative growth rate. The data from this experiment were analyzed {{in such a way that}} the effects of nuclear genes, of cytoplasms, and of nuclear genes x cytoplasms could be assessed;A. sterilis nuclear effects on grain yield, straw yield, and plant height were large, even in the BC(, 2), indicating much genetic variability was present in A. sterilis for these traits. The importance of the A. sativa parents to differences among matings increased with backcrossing to the A. sativa parent for all traits except plant height and grain yield. With random backcrossing, specific nicking ability of A. sterilis and A. sativa was lost, with the result that parental performance per se was a good indicator of the performance of a mating;Generally, the values for straw yield, plant height, unit straw weight, and vegetative growth rate were increased by A. sterilis cytoplasm, but these advantages decreased with backcrossing and were lost by BC(, 2). Probably, this relationship with level of backcrossing resulted because interactions between A. sterilis cytoplasms and A. sterilis nuclear genes were responsible for the improved performance. Harvest index showed an advantage for A. sterilis cytoplasm in the BC(, 1) and BC(, 2). Grain yield and heading date were significantly increased by A. sterilis cytoplasm and these effects were not diminished by backcrossing. The effect of A. sterilis cytoplasm on heading date showed no mating interactions of <b>importance,</b> an <b>indication</b> of a direct cytoplasmic effect. The grain yield increase due to A. sterilis cytoplasm was most likely due to specific favorable interactions with A. sativa nuclear genomes;These results suggest that plant breeders might improve crop performance by making use of diverse cytoplasms. An additional benefit would be the added cytoplasmic diversity which could be a stabilizing influence on production...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} telephone speech {{perception in}} individuals who received cochlear implant {{in the period}} 1993 - 2003. METHODS: Twenty seven CI users were divided into pre and post-lingual groups, being the speech perception assessed in two stages: first by a list of sentences imposed on speakerphone with the same mapping {{used to evaluate the}} phone and, in a second stage, using the landline, landline phone adapter with CI and cell phone. RESULTS: In the group of pre-lingual hearing loss, 75 % of subjects were able to maintain a dialogue with the interlocutor and 19 % did so with difficulty. In the post-lingual group, 89 % were able to maintain the dialogue with the interlocutor and 11 % did so with difficulty. Both groups of subjects pre and post-lingual use the phone as a media, and most have satisfactory performance without the need for aid or CI accessories. CONCLUSION: One of the benefits of the CI is to introduce the life of the hearing impaired phone use regardless of their technology and accessories, {{as well as with the}} phone adapter and cell phone. In this study, most individuals CI users showed satisfactory performance in the comprehension of sentence and questions by the telephone, with better performance, although discrete, for the group post-lingual. Thus, there is the <b>importance</b> of careful <b>indication</b> of the IC and auditory rehabilitation program that minimize the impact of deafness in the communication, especially via telephone, regardless of the time when the hearing was acquired. So, this fact improves the conditions for CI users to maintain their daily activities, following the dynamism of contemporary life...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: To the authors' knowledge, {{the extent}} to which death from bladder cancer is {{attributable}} to tumor biology or physician practice patterns is unknown. For this reason, the relative <b>importance</b> of broadening <b>indications</b> for aggressive therapy has unclear implications. METHODS: Patients whose deaths were caused directly by bladder cancer were identified using institutional (n = 126 patients) and administrative (n = 6326 patients) data sources. By using implicit review (clinical data, 2001 - 2005) and explicit algorithms (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results [SEER]-Medicare, 1992 - 2002), the authors estimated the proportion of potentially avoidable deaths from bladder cancer. RESULTS: After an implicit review of clinical data, 40 of 126 deaths (31. 7 %) were classified as potentially avoidable. Compared with those patients who were deemed unsalvageable, these patients generally presented with nonmuscle-invasive disease (80 % vs 25. 6 %; P <. 001), received multiple courses of intravesical therapy (32. 5 % vs 1. 2 %; P <. 001), and had a more protracted course from diagnosis to aggressive treatment (median, 23 months vs 2 months; P <. 001). An explicit review of claims data indicated that between 31. 6 % and 46. 8 % of the 6326 bladder cancer deaths identified in the SEER-Medicare data potentially were avoidable, depending on the survivorship threshold chosen. Patients whose deaths potentially were avoidable more commonly presented with nonmuscle-invasive disease (66. 7 % vs 24. 7 %; P <. 0001) and lower grade disease (35. 1 % vs 15. 1 %; P <. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: The greatest inroads into reducing death from bladder cancer likely hinge on earlier detection or improvement of systemic therapies. However, changing physician practice may translate into nontrivial reductions in bladder cancer mortality. Cancer 2009. © 2009 American Cancer Society...|$|R
40|$|Summary. -Ethylene oxide and 1, 2 -propylene oxide {{were each}} {{administered}} intragastrically by gavage at 2 dosages (30 and 7 - 5 mg/kg body wt; 60 and 15 mg/kg body wt respectively) {{to groups of}} 50 female Sprague-Dawley rats twice weekly {{for a period of}} nearly 3 years using salad oil as the solvent. Both compounds induced local tumours, mainly squamous-cell carcinomas of the forestomach, dependent on the dosage. The first tumour occurred in the 79 th week both in the group treated with ethylene oxide and in that treated with 1, 2 -propylene oxide. The following tumour rates resulted: ethylene oxide 62 and 16 %; 1, 2 -propylene oxide 40 and 4 %. In addition carcinomata in situ, papillomas and reactive changes of the squamous epithelium of the forestomach were observed in other animals, but neither ethylene oxide nor 1, 2 -propylene oxide induced tumours at sites away from the point of administration. THE PRESENT ANNUAL CONSUMPTION of ethylene oxide in Western Europe stands at around 2 - 5 million tonnes (Schonfeldt, 1976), of which most is used in the production of various organic compounds. Ethylene oxide is also used for the fumigation of food and sterilization in the field of medicine. The carcinogenic risk is of particular <b>importance</b> in man. <b>Indications</b> of possible carcinogenic activity of ethylene oxide arise primarily from the mutagenic efficiency which has been proven by various methods of testing (see review by Glaser, 1979; Wolman, 1979; Ehrenberg & Hussain, 1981). Teratogenic effects could also be induced by ethylene oxide (La Borde & Kimmel, 1981). The alkylation of DNA and RNA or the mononucleotides by ethylene oxide and 1, 2 -propylene oxide has been investigate...|$|R
