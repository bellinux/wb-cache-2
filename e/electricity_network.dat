40|$|The {{debate on}} <b>electricity</b> <b>networks</b> {{privatization}} in the Australian National Electricity Market {{is an important}} public policy concern but remains unsettled. This article reviews and compares the economic performance between the privately and state-owned <b>electricity</b> <b>networks</b> in Australia across three dimensions encompassing prices, quality and investment. The comparative analysis suggests that privately owned networks are not worse off than the state-owned networks in terms of performance. However, international empirical evidence indicates that the efficiency gains to consumers from <b>electricity</b> <b>networks</b> privatization {{will depend on the}} underlying regulatory regime and regulatory institutional framework. The long-term concerns on future investments, security of supply, climate change and economic regulation of networks will continue to prevail once the short-term efficiency gains from privatization are exhausted. These concerns imply that {{the role of the state}} will still be significant, although transformed, even after <b>electricity</b> <b>networks</b> privatization raising questions on the motives of privatization...|$|R

25|$|GEDCO {{estimates}} {{the damage to}} the <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> due to the recent hostilities at over $10 million. Even before the conflict, its reserves of spare parts were close to depletion due to the 18-month blockade on Gaza. By 29 January 38 transformers essential for the repair of the electricity system are still waiting permission from the Israelis to be allowed into Gaza. Due to the lack of supplies, GEDCO continues to partially repair the network where possible. The UN warns that those ad-hoc partial repairs will increase technical losses by 25-30 percent, reduce the lifetime of network components, and further expose sections of the network to possible collapse. Since the cease-fire, Israel has allowed approximately 87 tonnes cooking gas per day, which is much less than the estimated need of 300 tonnes per day. No petrol or diesel has been allowed into Gaza since 2 November, except for UNRWA. No petrol, diesel or cooking gas was allowed by Israel into Gaza between 8 and 14 February.|$|E

This thesis proposes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based approach for detection and classification of islanding events in a distribution network embedded with Distributed Generation (DG). Furthermore, two innovative approaches, which include three-phase voltage ellipse method and 3 D polarization ellipse technique, are proposed to detect, classify and characterize voltage dips and/or swells in <b>electricity</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

The most significant damage occurred in New Caledonia where wind and flooding destroyed crops, gardens and caused disruption to the <b>electricity</b> <b>network,</b> water supply, road and telephone communications.

Within Vanuatu, Beti caused about , (...) in damage to food gardens and shelters. As an extratropical cyclone, Beti generated a high surf and long period swells that hit both eastern Australia and New Zealand. Within Australia, the high surf left several competitors in the Australian life surfing championships injured, while another competitor was killed after his boat was swamped by large waves. Within New Zealand, Beti's remnants caused flooding and mud-slips, which led to several roads being closed.
