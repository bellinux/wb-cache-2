25|$|Often retirees {{are called}} upon to care for grandchildren and {{occasionally}} aged parents. For many it gives them more time to devote to a hobby or sport such as <b>golf</b> <b>or</b> sailing. On the other hand, many retirees feel restless and suffer from depression {{as a result of their}} new situation. Although it is not scientifically possible to directly show that retirement either causes or contributes to depression, the newly retired are one of the most vulnerable societal groups when it comes to depression most likely due to confluence of increasing age and deteriorating health status. Retirement coincides with deterioration of one's health that correlates with increasing age and this likely plays a major role in increased rates of depression in retirees. Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies have shown that healthy elderly and retired people are as happy or happier and have an equal quality of life as they age as compared to younger employed adults, therefore retirement in and of itself is not likely to contribute to development of depression.|$|E
500|$|Many sociologists {{have assumed}} that a given type of leisure {{activity}} is most easily explained by socioeconomic variables such as income, occupation or education. This has yielded fewer results than expected; income is associated with total money spent on such activities, but otherwise only determines what type of activities are affordable. Occupation has a similar effect, because most occupations heavily influence a person's income (for example, membership in a prestigious occupation and [...] "country-club" [...] activities such as <b>golf</b> <b>or</b> sailing are significantly correlated—but so is membership in those occupations and high income, and those activities with high cost). Education is correlated with having {{a wide range of}} leisure activities, and with higher dedication to them.

500|$|When first {{built in}} 1869, Sri Temasek was the {{residence}} of the Colonial Secretary of the Straits Settlements (later Colonial Secretary/Chief Secretary of Singapore).

In the 1998 book Lee Kuan Yew: The Man and His Ideas, Lee Kuan Yew said that when he became Prime Minister in 1959 he and his wife Kwa Geok Choo decided not to move into Sri Temasek with their three children, who were then aged seven, five and two, because the couple [...] "did not want them to grow up in such grand surroundings with butlers and orderlies to fuss over their needs". The family did stay there in 1965 for a short time for security reasons when Singapore was expelled from Malaysia. Apart from that, according to a 2000 Straits Times interview with Kwa, the Lee children often played in the grounds of the house in the evening while their father played <b>golf</b> <b>or</b> made use of the practice tee and putting green.|$|E

2500|$|The task of {{formally}} investigating {{student and}} alumni complaints fell to L. Hollingsworth Wood, Vice-Chair of Fisk's board of trustees, and chief {{spokesman for the}} trustees.

[...] "I am sure if I took the presidency of Fisk and played <b>golf</b> <b>or</b> hunted or danced or dined with the cultured whites of Nashville that but few of my many Negro friends would keep unshaken faith in me, and many would attribute sinister motives to perfectly innocent actions on my part." [...] Wood sympathized with some of the students' demands, noting their irritation over [...] "some rather antiquated regulations as to dress and discipline," [...] and conceding that [...] "President's McKenzie's Scotch nature is a bit unbending." [...] Wood responded to accusations that Fisk was at the mercy of Southern interests, declaring, [...] "that there has been anything even distantly resembling ‘Selling out to the South' is utterly preposterous. Wood praised McKenzie in gaining the good will of the citizens of Nashville, Vanderbilt and Peabody Colleges, but this ‘keeping-the-Negro-in-his-place" [...] cry is utterly unfounded." ...|$|E
2500|$|The MCC {{stayed for}} another game with {{reinforcements}} from the east; the Australian openers Bobby Simpson and Bill Lawry and the strokemaker Norm O'Neill. Perth {{would not see}} a Test match until 1970-71 and this game helped to compensate by showing off some Test players and trying them out against the opposition. Barry Shepherd won the toss, but there was confusion over his decision to field. Ted Dexter led the MCC out, certain that Shepherd would bat and the Western Australian captain had to run out and call them back in. the big fast bowler Des Hoare (3/42) sent Colin Cowdrey and Ted Dexter back to the pavilion, the young Garth McKenzie (4/38) accounted for Tom Graveney and Ken Barrington and the MCC had lost four top batsmen for 14 runs in six overs. [...] "The Rev" [...] David Sheppard (43) and the Essex all rounder Barry Knight (65) held off the venomous attack until lunch, when Sheppard was caught by Simpson off Tony Lock (3/36), the tail failed to support Knight, and the MCC were out for 157. Lawry (52) and Simpson (109) were 96/0 at stumps and took their opening stand to 116 {{in the morning before}} Fred Trueman (3/65) separated them. The off-spinner David Allen (5/76) took the next five wickets, Vernon, O'Neill and Shepherd all failing and the Combined XI lost 7 wickets for 101 runs. The fielding was sluggish and catches were dropped as John parker (55) and McKenzie (48 not out) added 64 for the eighth-wicket and hoisted the score to 317. There was enough time for Hoare (5/60) to hand Cowdrey his pair before stumps, but Sheppard (92) and Dexter (60) added 99 and Sheppard and Barrington (44) 103 for the fourth wicket. These two stands made up two-thirds of the MCC's runs as they were out for 270, O'Neill's (2/30) part-time leg-breaks removed Dexter and Graveney and McKenzie (3/66) dismissed Sheppard and then took the last two wickets. Lawry and Simpson knocked off 50 runs on the same day, but Lawry retired hurt on 15 after his big toe was hit and Vernon helped Simpson (66 not out) gather in the runs, 111/0 in the MCC's first defeat at the WACA. Jack Fingleton thought they lost because of too much golf, which led to a press furore and some papers wondered if the MCC were cricketers who played <b>golf</b> <b>or</b> golfers who played cricket. After one poor round on the links the Duke joked that all this cricket was affecting his golf, and one journalist wrote that he had better give up his golf to improve his writing. Three of the keenest golfers were Ted Dexter, Colin Cowdrey and Ken Barrington, who made 102, 88 and 219 not out at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in a couple of weeks.|$|E
