40|$|THESIS 9658 The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} {{was to investigate the}} biocompatibility potential of commercially available non-precious <b>dental</b> <b>casting</b> alloys facilitated by multiple analyses using a two-dimensional (2 D) oral keratinocyte (TR 146) cell monolayer structure and a novel three-dimensional (3 D) human-derived, full-thickness, differentiated oral mucosal model. The first section of the study aimed to determine the influence of the surface finishing condition of a Ni-based (d. Sign? 10) <b>dental</b> <b>casting</b> alloy on the biocompatibility potential. The biocompatibility was determined following direct and indirect exposure of the <b>dental</b> <b>casting</b> alloys to the 2 D oral keratinocyte cell monolayer structures. The clinically relevant polished <b>dental</b> <b>casting</b> alloys induced significantly increased adverse biological effects compared with the ?as-cast? alumina particle air abraded alloys. In addition, the study showed that the use of trypsin-edetate disodium (EDTA) was inappropriate in the determination of the TR 146 cell density measurements and highlighted difficulties for comparisons with trypsin-EDTA-treated cell density studies in the dental literature. The biocompatibility potential of two polished Ni- based (d. Sign? 10 and d. Sign? 15) and a cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) (d. Sign? 30) <b>dental</b> <b>casting</b> alloy were investigated on the 2 D TR 146 cell monolayer structure and compared using multiple analyses. The d. Sign? 15 <b>dental</b> <b>casting</b> alloy was shown to elicit significantly increased adverse morphological and physiological responses from the 2 D TR 146 cell monolayer structures compared with the d. Sign? 10 alloy and the Co-Cr (d. Sign? 30) alloy. The influence of oral microorganisms (Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis) on the biocompatibility potential of the <b>dental</b> <b>casting</b> alloys was also determined using the 2 D TR 146 cell monolayer structure. Oral microorganisms were shown to enhance the loss of biocompatibility, possibly due to the decreased pH levels, which exacerbated metal ion leachate release levels from the alloys...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{biocompatibility}} of <b>dental</b> <b>casting</b> alloys is {{a critical}} issue because these alloys are in long-term intimate contact with oral tissues. Since the biocompatibility of alloys is not completely known; the release of elements from the alloys has been studied.

40|$|Objective: To (1) {{evaluate}} {{the stability of}} palatal rugae as landmarks for superimposition of <b>dental</b> <b>casts</b> and (2) establish a three-dimensional superimposition method of maxillary <b>dental</b> <b>casts</b> for analyzing orthodontic tooth movement. Materials and Methods: The sample consisted of <b>dental</b> <b>casts</b> obtained from 10 patients treated with extraction of bilateral maxillary first premolars and placement of three palatal miniscrews as anchorage for retraction of the anterior teeth. <b>Dental</b> <b>casts</b> were measured by means of laser surface scanning system, and three-dimensional images were reconstructed. Serial <b>dental</b> <b>casts</b> were superimposed on the three miniscrews as registration landmarks (miniscrew-superimposition method), and the displacement of each palatal ruga point during the closure of extraction spaces was measured. Displacement of the central incisors {{was measured by the}} miniscrew-superimposition method and the proposed superimposition technique (ruga-palate-superimposition method). Correlation analysis and paired t-tests were performed to determine whether a significant difference existed between the measurements of the two superimposition methods. Results: The medial points of the third palatal rugae and the shape of the palatal vault were stable throughout the treatment. The displacement of the central incisors measured using the ruga-palate-superimposition method showed no significant difference with that measured using the miniscrew-superimposition method.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the long term effect of abrasivity of toothpastes normally used over the surface and mechanical properties of <b>dental</b> <b>casting</b> alloys. Three <b>dental</b> <b>casting</b> alloys (Ni-Cr, Co-Cr, c. p. Ti) and one ceramic were chosen. Four specimens of each material were immersed in artificial saliva, brushed without or with one of four toothpastes of different Relative Dentine Abrasivity (RDA 50, 52, 80, and 114). An electric toothbrush with a load of 250 g was used for 420 min. Mass loss was determined by difference in weight, microhardness and surface roughness were also measured. Two-way ANOVA and non-parametric tests were used to detect significant differences. Titanium specimens (478 microg/cm(2)) exhibited the most mass loss, whereas ceramic (282 microg/cm(2)) and Co-Cr (262 microg/cm(2)) exhibited the least. However, ceramic demonstrated the most volume loss (0. 239 mm(3)). The abrasivity effect of the toothpaste correlated with the RDA values. Slight variations in microhardness were observed after toothbrushing and depended on the material but not on the toothpaste used.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} the action of molten gold alloy during the actual casting process. The action was {{recorded}} by high-speed photog-raphy through a silica window. An under-standing of the directional forces of the molten alloy is helpful for space location and orientation of the casting ring. During the last 50 years, gold casting has achieved a high degree of excellence, but it still must be considered an empirical pro-cedure. 1 - This is evident when two identi-cal patterns are cast under supposedly iden-tical conditions; one may be a dense high quality casting, but the other may be porous or actually miscast. Many theories exist about spruing and venting as a means of eliminating porosity and miscasting. These theories are based on the examination of the completed rough castings, a method that has not proven to be completely reliable. To place <b>dental</b> <b>casting</b> on a scientific basis, we should obtain a greater understanding of the problems involved with gold delivery and solidification during <b>dental</b> <b>casting.</b> The objective of this research was to ex-amine the actual processes of gold delivery and solidification. To accomplish this ob-jective, high-speed photographic techniques were used, which permitted direct observa-tion and analysis of gold flow during the casting process.

40|$|Dental {{prostheses}} {{are usually}} {{made by a}} casting process. Most currently available dental alloys are therefore developed to facilitate <b>dental</b> <b>casting.</b> Cutting and grinding of dental materials have been regarded as finishing processes rather than forming methods. Current CAD/CAM technology is a considerable advancement over conventional <b>dental</b> <b>casting,</b> and machining {{has become one of}} the important forming methods. However, few dental alloys have been developed for good machinability (ease of cutting or grinding). Titanium is widely known as an excellent biomaterial because of its superior biocompatibility and corrosion resistance, but it remains one of the most difficult dental materials to process. Some dental applications demand materials with high strength as well as improved machinability. To this end, in this study, experimental titanium alloys were developed for dental CAD/CAM systems. The alloying elements chosen were copper, silver, and gold from β-eutectoid elements and zirconium, niobium, and hafnium from β-isomorphous elements. Among the experimental binary titanium alloys tested, certain Ti-Ag alloys were found to provide both better machinability and higher strength compared to unalloyed titanium. The improved machinability could be attributed to the finely dispersed brittle second phase that reduces elongation. The Ti-Ag alloys showed both corrosion resistance comparable to unalloyed titanium and anti-biofilm characteristics with no bactericidal activity. The spontaneous formation of calcium phosphate on the alloys in simulated body fluid was also confirmed. Ti-Ag alloys are thus good candidates for use as machinable dental biomaterials...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the long term effect of abrasivity of toothpastes normally used over the corrosion behavior and ion release of the different <b>dental</b> <b>casting</b> alloys. Three <b>dental</b> <b>casting</b> alloys (Ni-Cr, Co-Cr and commercially pure Ti) were studied. Four specimens of each material were immersed, brushed without paste or brushed with one of four toothpastes of different Relative Dentine Abrasivity (RDA 50, 52, 80, and 114). An electric toothbrush with a load of 250 g was used for 420 min. Corrosion behavior was determined by means a potenciostat with high sensitivity and the ion release determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry. Two-way ANOVA and non-parametric tests were used to detect significant differences. Titanium specimens exhibited the best corrosion behavior after and before the toothbrushed, being the worst of the three alloys the Cr-Ni. Titanium oxide produced spontaneously on the Ti surface is the main cause of the high corrosion resistance of the material. However, the eutectoid of the CrNi with chemical composition between different phases produces pitting on the phases boundaries with an important decrease of the corrosion resistance. Besides, the CrNi produces high values of the Ni and Cr release. Slight increment in roughness were observed after toothbrushing and depended on the material but not on the toothpaste used. The increase of the microhardness (residual stresses) provokes a decrease of the corrosion resistance and an increase of the ion release...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{accuracy}} of reproducing maximal intercuspal position (IP) on <b>dental</b> <b>casts</b> without using a wax-index as compared with the IP determined by the wax index on the same models. The material consisted of <b>dental</b> <b>casts,</b> which were taken from 15 -year old adolescents as part of oral examinations during the ”Fit Futures – part of The Tromsø Study”. All <b>dental</b> <b>casts</b> having wax bites were included in this study (N= 80). Two examiners assessed Angle’s classification and overjet on all <b>dental</b> <b>casts</b> twice, first fitting the <b>dental</b> <b>casts</b> together by hand articulation without using the wax index and second time using the wax index. Differences between the first and second assessment were measured and the agreement was analyzed using Cohen’s kappa. In 49 % of the models, there was no difference in overjet measurements with or without using an occlusal index, while 21 % of the casts showed a difference of more than 0. 5 mm, out of which 2 casts differed more than 1 mm. Agreement on Angle’s classification was 93 % on the right side and 91 % on the left between the two measurements. In molar millimeter measurements 16 - 20 % of the cases showed more than 0. 5 mm difference between the assessments. An agreement on treatment need between the first and second measurement, based on overjet values, was found in 84 % of the cases. The results suggest that in the majority of <b>dental</b> <b>casts</b> with permanent dentition and no extreme malocclusions, the maximal intercuspal position may be reproduced acceptably by hand articulation without a wax index. However, this method may not be reliable enough for research purposes or for planning of orthodontic treatment in some individual patients with severe occlusal deviations...|$|R

Balb/c 3 T 3 cells were plated in 24 -well culture trays at 25, 000 cells/cm 2 around ten types of <b>dental</b> <b>casting</b> alloy (six samples/alloy) and incubated for 72 h. Cells were histochemically stained with MTT (3 -[4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) succinate for 2 h, then fixed, washed, and dried. Toxicity was measured by optical densitometer (OD) scanning, visual assessment, and 560 -nm absorbance of DMSO-solubilized dyes. Measurements of rings of inhibition were not used, because they did not provide precise data, and correlated poorly with the other methods. The results were analyzed by ANOVA, Tukey intervals, and coefficients of variation (CV's). MTT required shorter incubation times for adequate staining, allowed for solubilization of the monolayers, and was less expensive than NBT (2, 2 '-di-p-nitro-phenyl- 5, 5 '-diphenyl- 3, 3 '-dimethoxy-[3, 3 '-dimethoxy- 4, 4 '-biphenylene] ditetrazolium chloride). Results showed that all three methods ranked alloy toxicities similarly (p = 0. 05). The solubilization method was most discriminating due to lower CV's. Correlation between densitometer and solubilization methods was excellent (R 2 = 0. 96). Between-experiment CV's were generally less than 20 %, and often less than 10 %.

Single regression analysis indicated an overall difference of 0. 02 degrees between radiographic third order inclination and cast assessment in the maxilla (mandible: − 2. 83 degrees). A change of 1 degree in radiographic third order inclination would produce a change of 0. 65 degrees for U 1 TA and 0. 86 degrees for L 1 TA assessments. Third order measurements on <b>dental</b> <b>casts</b> can best be explained by a linear combination of U 1 TR and U 1 E (maxilla) and of L 1 TR and L 1 C (mandible) measurements. This study demonstrates the functional enmeshment between two different third order assessments and the most common incisor features on lateral radiographs. Both methods of third order evaluation show sufficient reliability and are appropriate for routine orthodontic practic...|$|R
