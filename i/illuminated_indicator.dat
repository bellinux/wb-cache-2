50|$|On {{the top of}} the {{controller}} is a row of four numbered LEDs, which are used to identify and distinguish multiple wireless controllers. These are similar to the indicators found on the Wii remote and the ring of light Xbox 360 Controller. Since the PlayStation 3 supports up to 7 controllers, but {{the controller}} only features 4 LEDs, controllers 5, 6 and 7 are represented as the sum of two other indicators (for example controller 5 is represented by <b>illuminating</b> <b>indicators</b> '4' and '1' at the same time, since 4+1=5). Sony also patented a technology to be able to track the motion of these LEDs with the PlayStation Eye camera for use alongside the PlayStation Move Controller. Though this was never utilised with the DualShock 3, its successor, the DualShock 4, features a light bar used for motion tracking, as well as player identification.|$|R

The CVRJ system accomplishes its primary mission by jamming each threat's transmitted RF signals. The secondary purpose of the CVRJ system is to add the capability to combine multiple internal RF signals and external RF inputs from other systems, and serve as the conduit for transmitting those RF signals while maintaining system interoperability. It accomplishes both missions via 15 waveform programmable RF channels. The system is software controlled to meet specific threats. Indicators on the CVRJ front panel and Remote Control Unit (RCU) allow the operator to observe system health and diagnostic messages. Built-In-Test (BIT) routines run during system initialization and operation that notify the operator of system faults by <b>illuminating</b> <b>indicators</b> referred to as “annunciators” and by displaying text messages on the RCU display. The system is highly automated which reduces operator interaction. The system draws up to 36 amps of vehicle power, weighs approximately 69 lbs, and measures 13”H x 14”W x 19”D.|$|R
50|$|The console {{consisting}} of a vertical display panel about 10 in high by about 5 ft long with a similarly sized slightly angled control panel below it. Each of these two parts was filled with labeled buttons and <b>illuminated</b> <b>indicators</b> each (roughly) one inch square. The display section {{was made up of}} <b>indicators</b> which when <b>illuminated</b> showed, in binary (grouped as octal) characters, the machine’s current running (or static) status at the individual machine core address and register level, for the compute, read and write operations then in progress. When a program was running, this display was a kaleidoscope of quickly changing, flashing, multi-colored lights. The control panel section consisted of press-buttons to select the next register to be set and a central part that mirrored the lay-out of a single machine core address. Other buttons accessed more complex operations. Use of these buttons enabled the operator to select and then directly input to the machine’s core storage locations and registers the octal pattern he/she keyed in manually. For an operator to input a single machine instruction, each of up to ten octal characters of the instruction had to be selected and keyed in as its binary pattern - each with the correct (odd) parity bit.|$|R

50|$|Clipping in {{a circuit}} can be {{detected}} by comparing the original input signal with an output signal that has been adjusted for changes in applied gain. For instance, if a circuit has 10 dB of applied gain, it can be tested for clipping by attenuating the output signal's gain by 10 dB and comparing it to the input signal. If the circuit is driven into clipping, the attenuated output signal will show less voltage in the comparison. The electrical offset between the two signals {{can be used to}} <b>illuminate</b> clipping detection <b>indicators,</b> such as a red LED, and can be used to decrease the gain of a preceding circuit so that the level of clipping distortion can be limited.|$|R

5000|$|In late 2014, Meridian {{launched}} the Master Quality Authenticated (MQA) audio encoding {{system with the}} intention of enhancing the quality of digital music experienced via downloaded files or online streaming. MQA utilises a novel digital sampling technology that is capable of capturing extremely fine timing information accurately, down to the microsecond level, which Meridian claims is not possible with conventional techniques, even at high sample rates. Meridian maintains that current neuroscience indicates such timing accuracy is necessary for truly lifelike recording and reproduction. When an original master recording is MQA-encoded, this information is [...] "encapsulated" [...] into the bulk of the audio signal by [...] "folding" [...] it in two stages into a standard (typically 24-bit; 44.1 or 48 kHz sampling depending on the sample rate of the original signal) digital coding space but beneath the noise floor. The resulting data is transferred using any lossless audio format such as WAV, FLAC, Apple Lossless etc. As a result, the bandwidth required to stream an MQA file (or the size of a file for download) is significantly less than using conventional techniques, while retaining the full detail of the original master. On replay via an MQA decoder, the encapsulated detail is recovered, providing an exact representation of the original master recording, and this is confirmed ("authenticated") by the decoding system, generally <b>illuminating</b> an <b>indicator</b> light. If the information is replayed without an MQA decoder, the encapsulated data is ignored and audio quality somewhat better than Compact Disc (16-bit, 44.1 kHz sampling) is experienced. Initial listener reports appear to be positive. In 2015, Meridian Audio Ltd spun off MQA into its own company, MQA Limited, set up for the purpose in July 2014 and based at the Meridian address in Huntingdon, UK.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{methodology}} {{for the study of}} multi-dimensional aspects of poverty and deprivation. The conventional poor/non-poor dichotomy is replaced by defining poverty as a matter of degree, determined by the place of the individual in the income distribution. The fuzzy poverty measure proposed is in fact also expressible in terms of the generalised Gini measure. The same methodology facilitates the inclusion of other dimensions of deprivation into the analysis: by appropriately weighting indicators of deprivation to reflect their dispersion and correlation, we can construct measures of non-monetary deprivation in its various dimensions. These <b>indicators</b> <b>illuminate</b> the extent to which purely monetary indicators are insufficient in themselves in capturing the prevalence of deprivation. An important contribution of the paper is to identify rules for the aggregation of fuzzy sets appropriate for the study of poverty and deprivation. In particular, we define a ‘composite’ fuzzy set operator which takes into account whether the sets being aggregated are of a ‘similar’ or a ‘dissimilar’ type. These rules allow us to meaningfully combine income and the diverse non-income deprivation indices at the micro-level and construct what we have termed ‘intensive’ and ‘extensive’ indicators of deprivation. We note that mathematically the same approach can be carried over to the study of persistence of poverty and deprivation over time...|$|R

OLEDs have many advantages over current displays. Conventional displays require constant backlighting which draws {{a lot of}} power, but with OLEDs they generate light themselves.

What is not known is how they will perform in a space-like environment; specifically deep space far away from the Earth's magnetosphere. In this environment, the OLEDs can be expected to experience vacuum and galactic radiation. The intern's responsibility has been to prepare the OLED for a battery of tests. Unfortunately, it will not be ready for testing {{at the end of the}} internship. That being said much progress has been made: a) Developed procedures to safely disassemble the tablet. b) Inventoried and identified critical electronic components. c) 3 D printed a testing apparatus. d) Wrote software in Python that will test the OLED screen while being radiated. e) Built circuits to restart the tablet and the test pattern, and ensure it doesn't fall asleep during radiation testing. f) Built enclosure that will house all of the electronics Also, the intern has been working on a way to take messages from a simulated Caution and Warnings system, process said messages into packets, send audio packets to a multicast address that audio boxes are listening to, and output spoken audio. Currently, Cautions and Warnings use a tone to alert crew members of a situation, and then crew members have to read through their checklists to determine what the tone means. In urgent situations, EV 3 wants to deliver concise and specific alerts to the crew to facilitate any mitigation efforts on their part.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to analyse and {{describe}} the content of the National Drug Master Plan 2006 - 2011 (NDMP 2) from a social development perspective. In order to achieve this goal, a quantitative research approach was adopted to determine objectively whether indicators of social development are encapsulated in the manifest content of the NDMP 2. To this end a cross-sectional survey research design guided the study. A checklist, as a data collection instrument, was developed and utilised to collect data. The validity, that is face and content validity, and reliability (r = 0. 98) of the checklist, was confirmed. From the raw data, descriptive statistics, specifically frequencies and percentages, were calculated. Three different genres of policy analysis were undertaken to answer the following research question: “Is the content of the NDMP 2 in accordance with a social development perspective?” The key finding of the study was that, holistically interpreted, the NDMP 2 is in accordance with a social development perspective because all ten the identified dimensions of a social development theoretical framework, i. e. capital development, innovation, integrated service delivery strategy, intervention by social service professionals, levels of service delivery, mandate, partnerships, principles, a rights-based approach and target groups, are captured in the content of the policy, albeit with different prominence. In addition, it was found that the NDMP 2 has specific limitations due to the exclusion of several indicators of social development. It was concluded that the content of the NDMP 2 has both strengths and limitations, when interpreted from a social development perspective. Amongst the strengths of the NDMP 2 are the following: a multi-sectoral approach; bridging of the micro-macro divide; and provision for vulnerable groups, with the emphasis on the youth and children. The limitations of the NDMP 2 are that its strategic framework fails to give equal weight to harm reduction strategies, alongside demand and supply reduction strategies; economic capital development is totally omitted; clear indicators for the monitoring and evaluating of policy are absent; treatment, as a level of service delivery, receives the most attention at the expense of prevention, early intervention and aftercare and reintegration services; a human-rights approach towards service delivery is not adequately emphasised; and, lastly, the NDMP 2 does not make provision for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people as a vulnerable group. To align future National Drug Master Plans (i. e. NDMP 2012 - 2016) with a social development approach, the recommendations are, amongst others, to ensure equal attention is given to demand, supply and harm reduction strategies; to include economic capital development in the service delivery framework; to <b>illuminate</b> clear <b>indicators</b> for policy evaluation purposes; to provide equal weight to all levels of service delivery; and to ensure a human-rights approach to service delivery is clearly delineated. Future research could compare the content of all the National Drug Master Plans in South Africa as valuable insights could be obtained about the development of such policies and the alignment of these plans with a social development approach.
