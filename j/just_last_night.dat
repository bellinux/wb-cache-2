The first man I met in Chester was Dr. Raymond.(3) He and Mrs. Raymond were here about levying a fine, in order to have power to sell their estate. They have found everything answer very well. They both desire to present their humble services to you: they do not think of Ireland till next year. I got a fall off my horse, riding here from Parkgate,(4) but no hurt; the horse understanding falls very well, and lying quietly till I get up. My duty to the Bishop of Clogher.(5) I saw him returning from Dunleary; but he saw not me. I take it ill he was not at Convocation, and that I have not his name to my powers.(6) I beg you will hold your resolution of going to Trim, and riding there as much as you can. Let the Bishop of Clogher remind the Bishop of Killala(7) to send me a letter, with one enclosed to the Bishop of Lichfield.(8) Let all who write to me, enclose to Richard Steele, Esq., at his office at the Cockpit, near Whitehall.(9) But not MD; I will pay for their letters at St. James's Coffee-house,(10) that I may have them the sooner. My Lord Mountjoy(11) is now in the humour that we should begin our journey this afternoon; so that I have stole here again to finish this letter, which must be short or long accordingly. I write this post to Mrs. Wesley,(12) and will tell her, that I have taken care she may have her bill of one hundred and fifteen pounds whenever she pleases to send for it; and in that case I desire you will send it her enclosed and sealed, and have it ready so, in case she should send for it: otherwise keep it. I will say no more till I hear whether I go to-day or no: if I do, the letter is almost at an end. My cozen Abigail is grown prodigiously old. God Almighty bless poo dee richar MD; and, for God's sake, be merry, and get oo health. I am perfectly resolved to return as soon as I have done my commission, whether it succeeds or no. I never went to England with so little desire in my life. If Mrs. Curry(13) makes any difficulty about the lodgings, I will quit them and pay her from July 9 last, and Mrs. Brent(14) must write to Parvisol(15) with orders accordingly.

It is something not to be forgotten. A friend called me up <b>just</b> after 12 <b>last</b> <b>night</b> to mark the peculiar noise of unusually immense flocks migrating north (rather late this year.) In the silence, shadow and delicious odor of the hour, (the natural perfume belonging to the night alone,) I thought it rare music. You could hear the characteristic motion--once or twice [...] "the rush of mighty wings," [...] but often a velvety rustle, long drawn out--sometimes quite near--with continual calls and chirps, and some song-notes. It all lasted from 12 till after 3. Once in a while the species was plainly distinguishable; I could make out the bobolink, tanager, Wilson's thrush, white-crown'd sparrow, and occasionally from high in the air came the notes of the plover.|$|R

5000|$|In the 2009 film, Julie & Julia, Brassart {{was portrayed}} by Joan Juliet Buck in {{accordance}} to how Child described her. The movie has a caricatured version of her to dramatize a famous historical incident that Julia Child wrote about and others have repeated which certainly does not properly represent most people's memory of her. Shortly after the film's release, Nina Zagat, who also spent time at Le Cordon Bleu under Brassart, and her husband responded to the film's portrayal with an article comparing Brassart and Child, whom they both knew personally and stating that Brassart was more sympathetic in real life. [...] "Having known both women, we can safely say that it's hard to imagine two less compatible people. Julia was tall and assertive with a loud, braying voice in English—one {{can only imagine what}} she sounded like in French. Madame Brassart, in contrast, was petite, elegant, and aristocratic, and spoke impeccable French and English, as well as several other languages. She also was an important figure in culinary education, having successfully led Le Cordon Bleu from the late 1940s through 1985.

The {{tradition of}} the <b>Last</b> <b>Night</b> Speech dates from 1941, when Sir Henry Wood gave the first such speech at the close of that Proms season, the first at the Royal Albert Hall, where he thanked colleagues and sponsors. Wood gave another similar speech of thanks at the 1942 <b>Last</b> <b>Night,</b> and a pre-recorded version was aired to the audience at the 1943 <b>Last</b> <b>Night.</b> During his tenure as conductor of the Proms, Sir Malcolm Sargent established the tone of making the <b>Last</b> <b>Night</b> speeches more humorous in nature. Subsequent conductors at the <b>Last</b> <b>Night</b> have generally continued this tradition, although one exception was in 1997 when Sir Andrew Davis more seriously addressed the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales, Mother Teresa, and Sir Georg Solti in his 1997 <b>Last</b> <b>Night</b> speech.|$|R
