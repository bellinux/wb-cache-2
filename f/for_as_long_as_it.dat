5|$|At Minqar Qaim, the {{division}} was {{to hold and}} delay the advance of the Panzer Army Africa <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> could while remaining intact. By {{the middle of the}} afternoon of 27 June, {{the division}} had been encircled by the 21st Panzer Division. Panzer units approached a number of the 2nd New Zealand Division's positions, including the 20th Battalion's sector on the northern side of the Minqar Qaim escarpment, and were successfully beaten off. The New Zealanders broke out that evening with the 4th Brigade breaching the German lines and the 20th Battalion on the northern flank of the chosen withdrawal route. During the action at Minqar Qaim and the subsequent breakout, the battalion's casualties were light, with thirteen men killed and it reached the El Alamein line by 28 June.|$|E
5|$|For Walther, at the bridge, the {{position}} appeared defensible <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> {{would take to}} remove Ney's force through Winterthur, yet {{the shock of the}} Austrian force, as it hit his defences, was sufficient to break his line after 90 minutes of brisk fighting. But there the Austrian forward momentum stalled. Although Hotze's men forced Walther's from the bridge, they themselves could not cross it. From the ridge, Ney's rear guard maintained a steady stream of cannon fire on any of the Austrians who crossed the bridge and attempted to advance up the hill. Hotze recognised the futility of throwing his men into direct cannon fire and ordered instead a steady musketry barrage. This proved effective, for Ney was again injured, this time in his left hand, and his second horse was killed; he relinquished command to Gazan, who organised the continued withdrawal from {{the position}}.|$|E

25|$|A third wire, {{called the}} bond (or earth) wire, is often {{connected}} between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and earth ground. This conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools. Bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures {{there is always}} a low electrical impedance path to ground sufficient to carry any fault current <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> takes for the system to clear the fault. This low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current, causing the overcurrent protection device (breakers, fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible, bringing the electrical system to a safe state. All bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel, as is the neutral/identified conductor if present.|$|E
25|$|The {{defensive}} team {{tries to}} stop the attacking team from scoring by tackling the player with the ball {{as quickly as possible}} to prevent him gaining more ground. A tackle forces a halt in play <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> takes the tackled player to return to his feet and play the ball. In that time, the defending team, with the exception of two markers, must move back a minimum of 10 metres towards their end of the field. The attacking team restarts play and continues with its next chance to score via the play-the-ball. After each tackle the attacking team should be closer to their opposition's end of the field. A 2012 New Zealand study found that over 659 tackles are made per game in professional rugby league. Of all the rugby league positions, second-row forward averages the most tackles.|$|E
25|$|According {{to various}} accounts, Fondane {{made a point}} of not leaving Paris, despite the growing {{restrictions}} and violence. However, others note that, as a precaution against the antisemitic measures in the occupied north, he eventually made his way into the more permissive zone libre, and only made returns to Paris in order to collect his books. Throughout this interval, the poet refused to wear the yellow badge (mandatory for Jews), and, living in permanent risk, isolated himself from his wife, adopting an even more precarious lifestyle. He was still in contact with writers of various ethnic backgrounds, and active on the clandestine literary scene. In this context, Fondane stated his intellectual affiliation to the French Resistance: his former Surrealist colleague Paul Éluard published several of his poems in the pro-communist Europe, under the name of Isaac Laquedem (a nod to the Wandering Jew myth). Such pieces were later included, but left unsigned, in the anthology L'Honneur des poètes ("The Honor of Poets"), published by the Resistance activists as an anti-Nazi manifesto. Fondane also preserved his column in Cahiers du Sud <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was possible, and had his contributions published in several other clandestine journals.|$|E

500|$|It {{was in this}} milieu that Dada was born, at {{some point}} before May 1916, when a {{publication}} of the same name first saw print. The story of its establishment {{was the subject of a}} disagreement between Tzara and his fellow writers. Cernat believes that the first Dadaist performance took place as early as February, when the nineteen-year-old Tzara, wearing a monocle, entered the Cabaret Voltaire stage singing sentimental melodies and handing paper wads to his [...] "scandalized spectators", leaving the stage to allow room for masked actors on stilts, and returning in clown attire. The same type of performances took place at the Zunfthaus zur Waag beginning in summer 1916, after the Cabaret Voltaire was forced to close down. According to music historian Bernard Gendron, <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> lasted, [...] "the Cabaret Voltaire was dada. There was no alternative institution or site that could disentangle 'pure' dada from its mere accompaniment [...] nor was any such site desired." [...] Other opinions link Dada's beginnings with much earlier events, including the experiments of Alfred Jarry, André Gide, Christian Morgenstern, Jean-Pierre Brisset, Guillaume Apollinaire, Jacques Vaché, Marcel Duchamp or Francis Picabia.|$|E
500|$|A late Commentary on the Shulchan Arukh {{known as}} the Taz (Turei Zahav), on Yoreh De'ah 69:5:16, writes that the pieces of meat can be [...] "very thick" [...] when salting. The Yemenite Jewish practice, however, follows Rabbi Saadiah Gaon who {{required}} that the meat not be larger than half a [...] "rotal" [...] (i.e. ca. 216 grams) when salting. This allows {{the effects of the}} salt to penetrate. Some Orthodox Jewish communities require the additional stricture of submersing raw meat in boiling water prior to cooking it, a practice known as ḥaliṭah (...) , “blanching.” This was believed to constrict the blood lodged within the meat, to prevent its oozing out when it is eaten. The raw meat is left in the pot of boiling water <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> takes for the meat to whiten on its outer layer. If someone wanted to use the water for soup after making ḥaliṭah in the same pot, he simply scoops out the film, froth and scum that surface in the boiling water. Ḥaliṭah is not required when roasting meat over a fire, as the fire constricts the blood.|$|E

500|$|Les Jackson {{took over}} command of No.75 Squadron {{the day after}} his brother was killed. Although the {{squadron}} was no longer an effective fighting unit, it had checked Japan's attempts to overpower Port Moresby by air attack, and the town continued to function as an important Allied base. John Jackson was survived by his wife and children, and interred in Moresby's Bomana War Cemetery. His estate was sworn for probate at a value of £29,780 ($1,870,800 in 2011). [...] His name appears on panel 104 of the Commemorative Area at the Australian War Memorial (AWM), Canberra. [...] Jackson was a keen amateur film maker, and a four-minute reel of 16mm footage that he shot in Port Moresby is held by the AWM. Moresby's Seven Mile Aerodrome was renamed Jackson's Strip in his honour; it later became Jacksons International Airport. In a 1989 interview, fellow No.75 Squadron member Flight Lieutenant Albert Tucker commented, [...] "I would say that had JohnF. Jackson not existed, the squadron would not have been effective in that defence role <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was... So the whole spirit of JohnF's leadership, and I suppose his final sacrifice, was the thing that made 75 Squadron." [...] In March 2003, the St George township erected a monument to Jackson and another local RAAF identity, Aboriginal fighter pilot Len Waters.|$|E
