25|$|In the postseason, the Patriots first hosted their {{division}} rivals, the New York Jets, in the Wild Card Round. The Patriots {{defeated the}} Jets 37–16, as Brady went 22–34 for 212 {{yards and two}} touchdowns. In the Divisional Round, the Patriots traveled to San Diego {{to take on the}} Chargers. This was Brady's first playoff game {{in his home state of}} California. Brady and the Patriots struggled against the Chargers, whom many had picked as favorites to win Super Bowl XLI. With eight minutes left in the fourth quarter and the Patriots down by eight points, Brady and the Patriots started a <b>key</b> <b>drive</b> that would ultimately decide the game.

5000|$|Players play as {{an athlete}} named [...] "Qwop", who is {{participating}} in a 100-meter event at the Olympic Games. Using only the Q, W, O and P keys, players must control {{the movement of the}} athlete's legs to make the character move forward while trying to avoid falling over. The Q and W <b>keys</b> each <b>drive</b> one of the runner's thighs, while the O and P keys work the runner's calves. The Q <b>key</b> <b>drives</b> the runner's right thigh forward and left thigh backward, and the W key also affects the thighs and does the opposite. The O and P keys work {{in the same way as}} the Q and W keys, but with the runner's calves. The actual amount of movement of a joint is affected by the resistance due to forces from gravity and inertia placed upon it.|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} {{switching}} circuit for the absorption method is significant. It is switching a high voltage arc, so the switch's contacts {{must have some}} form of arc suppression. Eaton had the telegraph <b>key</b> <b>drive</b> electromagnets that operated a relay. That relay used four sets of switch contacts in series for each of the two paths (one to the antenna and one to the back shunt). Each relay contact was bridged by a resistor.

50|$|Florida State Road 292 {{begins on}} Perdido Key at a signalized {{pedestrian}} crosswalk along the Alabama-Florida state {{line at the}} east end of Alabama State Route 182, where the state line itself is used as a tourist attraction. The street name changes from Perdido Beach Boulevard in Alabama to Perdido <b>Key</b> <b>Drive</b> in Florida. At the Perdido Skye Condominiums, the road starts to curve more towards the northeast where it intersects Johnson Beach Road, then runs straight north until it reaches Gongora Drive where it curves northeast. The last intersection on Perdido Key is River Road, and from there it crosses the Theo Baars Bridge (formerly the Gulf Beach Bridge) over the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The first major intersection after this bridge is CR 292A (Gulf Beach Highway), which is also shared by Innerarity Point Road, a local street leading to the Naval Aviation Museum. At this intersection, the street name of SR 292 changes from Perdido <b>Key</b> <b>Drive</b> to Sorrento Drive. The route curves more towards the northeast only to turn back north again as it crosses a bridge over Bayou Garcon. After the bridge, SR 292 turns north-northeast, and after the Perdido Bay Country Club Estates development, turns northeast, where it has an intersection with CR 293 (Bauer Road). A much more significant intersection is encountered {{in the form of a}} four-lane divided state highway known as Florida State Road 173 (Blue Angel Parkway).|$|E

Climate {{change has}} been {{highlighted}} as an apparent and urgent challenge in environmental research fields, with increasing recognition that it has caused various issues such as temperature and sea level rising, season alternation changing, more frequent flood and storm and extreme events.

Actually, adverse impact is one of the <b>key</b> <b>drives</b> for incorporating climate change into China’s strategic environmental assessment, while another is improving China’s SEA system. This paper contributed to proposing a mechanism which helps to make China’s SEA put full consideration on issues related to climate change.

40|$|Ultra {{low power}} signal {{processing}} {{is an essential}} part of all sensor nodes, and particularly so in emerging wearable sensors for biomedical applications. Analog signal processing has an important role in these low power, low voltage, low frequency applications, and there is a <b>key</b> <b>drive</b> to decrease the power consumption of existing analog domain signal processing and to map more signal processing approaches into the analog domain. This paper presents an analog domain signal processing circuit which approximates the output of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for use in ultra low power wearable sensors. Analog filters are used for the DWT filters and it is demonstrated how these generate analog domain DWT-like information that embeds information from Butterworth and Daubechies maximally flat mother wavelet responses. The Analog DWT is realised in hardware via g m C circuits, designed to operate from a 1. 3 V coin cell battery, and provide DWT-like signal processing using under 115 nW of power when implemented in a 0. 18 μm CMOS process. Practical examples demonstrate the effective use of the new Analog DWT on ECG (electrocardiogram) and EEG (electroencephalogram) signals recorded from humans...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The study {{investigated}} the impact of operational work system design on staff performance in selected construction firms in Nigeria. Research Design & Methods: The study used primary data gathered {{with the use of}} a  5 -point Likert scale questionnaire format administered to 138 respondents. A hypothesis was postulated to test the significance of the research problem. Data analysis was carried out using correlation and multiple regression analysis which proved the significance of the alternative hypothesis as a result of testing the hypothesis. Findings: The findings show that there is a significant relationship between operational work system design and staff performance. The study concludes that operational job design can be advanced as a motivation tool, which is non-monetary in nature, to improve staff performance. Implications & Recommendations: A <b>key</b> <b>drive</b> to improve performance is the satisfaction of staff coupled with an outstanding operational job design which takes into consideration the total physical and mental well-being of staff and its interaction with other organisational factors. The study recommends, among others, that there should be active participation of staff in the design of work in the organisation. Contribution & Value Added: The study provides an empirical approach to enhancing performance in the construction industry and thereby developing an indigenous firm to compete favourably on a growing market...|$|E
