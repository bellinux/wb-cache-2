5|$|In January 1960, a {{group of}} local {{businessmen}} approached Carroll about leading a campaign to allow the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to provide electricity to McCracken County. TVA could provide electricity {{at a much lower}} cost, but voters would first <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> a public referendum on buying out Kentucky Utilities, the private power provider in the area. Carroll agreed to lead the campaign, and nine months later, voters approved the buyout by a three-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, UBS {{announced}} the planned cut of 8,700 jobs and had implemented a new compensation plan. Under the plan, {{no more than}} one-third of any cash bonus would be paid out in the year it is earned with the rest to be held in reserve and stock-based incentives that would vest after three years; top executives would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> 75% of any vested shares. Additionally, the bank's chairman, Peter Kurer, would no longer receive any extra variable compensation, only a cash salary and a fixed allotment of shares that could not be sold for four years. In April 2009, UBS announced that it agreed to sell its Brazilian financial services business, UBS Pactual, for approximately US$2.5billion to BTG Investments. UBS rejected proposals to break apart the bank and divest its investment banking division.|$|E
5|$|To {{compensate}} Luxembourg for {{the loss}} of the Commission and Council, a number of provisions were laid out. Firstly, the Court of Justice would remain in the city. Some departments of the Commission and the Assembly, including the Secretariat of the Assembly would remain along with European Investment Bank (further, particularly financial, institutions would also be prioritised for Luxembourg). The Council would also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> sessions in Luxembourg during April, June and October. It also confirmed Strasbourg as the seat of the Parliament. With the prioritisation of Luxembourg for future institutions, in 1977 the Court of Auditors became provisionally located in Luxembourg.|$|E

5|$|Captain Samuel Walker of the Texas Rangers had {{acquired}} {{some of the}} first Colt revolvers produced during the Seminole War and saw first-hand their effective use as his 15-man unit defeated a larger force of 70 Comanche in Texas. Walker wanted to order Colt revolvers for use by the Rangers in the Mexican-American War, and traveled to New York City in search of Colt. He met Colt in a gunsmith's shop on January 4, 1847, and placed an order for 1,000 revolvers. Walker asked for a few changes; the new revolvers would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> 6 shots instead of 5, have enough power to kill either a man or a horse with a single shot and be quicker to reload. The large order allowed Colt to establish a new firearm business. Colt hired Eli Whitney Blake, who was established in the arms business, to make his guns. Colt used his prototype and Walker's improvements as the basis for a new design. From this new design, Blake produced the first thousand-piece order known as the Colt Walker. The company then received an order for a thousand more; Colt took a share of the profits at $10 per pistol for both orders.|$|E
5|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the gas station, the crew rented out a 7-11 for a day. When Hurley drove in, the van was actually being pushed instead of driven to eliminate any sound from the vehicle. However, every time the van was pushed it would stall or the timing would be off. Once that problem had been solved, it started to rain, but eventually it stopped and the crew {{was able to get}} the shots before ending shooting at midnight. Hurley's dream scene was shot in the Hawaii Film Studio, where the hatch had been constructed. After each take of Hurley eating food in the hatch, the old food would be replaced with newer food. Garcia did not actually eat all the food though, he would sometimes just chew it and then spit it out into a garbage can. The chicken head that Bose had to wear was extremely heavy, causing actor Daniel Dae Kim to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> it up while Bose delivered his lines.|$|E
5|$|Gunnery {{developments}} in the late 1890s and the early 1900s, led in the United Kingdom by Percy Scott and in the United States by William Sims, were already pushing expected battle ranges out to an unprecedented , a distance great enough to force gunners {{to wait for the}} shells to arrive before applying corrections for the next salvo. A related problem was that the shell splashes from the more numerous smaller weapons tended to obscure the splashes from the bigger guns. Either the smaller-calibre guns would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> their fire to wait for the slower-firing heavies, losing the advantage of their faster rate of fire, or it would be uncertain whether a splash was due to a heavy or a light gun, making ranging and aiming unreliable. Another problem was that longer-range torpedoes were expected to soon be in service and these would discourage ships from closing to ranges where the smaller guns' faster rate of fire would become preeminent. Keeping the range open generally negated the threat from torpedoes and further reinforced the need for heavy guns of a uniform calibre.|$|E

500|$|The Persians sailed {{down the}} coast of Attica, and landed at the bay of Marathon, roughly [...] from Athens, {{on the advice of}} the exiled Athenian tyrant Hippias (who had {{accompanied}} the expedition). Under the guidance of Miltiades, the Athenian general with the greatest experience of fighting the Persians, the Athenian army marched quickly to block the two exits from the plain of Marathon, and prevent the Persians moving inland. At the same time, Athens's greatest runner, Pheidippides (or Philippides in some accounts) had been sent to Sparta to request that the Spartan army march to the aid of Athens. Pheidippides arrived during the festival of Carneia, a sacrosanct period of peace, and was informed that the Spartan army could not march to war until the full moon rose; Athens could not expect reinforcement for at least ten days. The Athenians would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> out at Marathon for the time being, although they were reinforced by the full muster of 1,000 hoplites from the small city of Plataea; a gesture which did much to steady the nerves of the Athenians, and won unending Athenian gratitude to Plataea.|$|E
500|$|Because of the Magic Wand's popularity, various {{aftermarket}} attachments with {{differences in}} colour, pattern of studs, and material, became available to purchase.
