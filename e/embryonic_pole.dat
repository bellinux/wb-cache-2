50|$|In {{mammalian}} embryogenesis, differentiation and {{segregation of}} cells composing the {{inner cell mass}} of the blastocyst yields two distinct layers—the epiblast ("primitive ectoderm") and the hypoblast ("primitive endoderm"). While the cuboidal hypoblast cells delaminate ventrally, away from the <b>embryonic</b> <b>pole,</b> to line the blastocoele, the remaining cells of the inner cell mass, situated between the hypoblast and the polar trophoblast, become the epiblast and comprise columnar cells.|$|E
40|$|Differentiation of the {{embryonic}} termini in Drosophila {{depends on}} signaling by the Tor RTK, which induces terminal gene expression by inactivating at the <b>embryonic</b> <b>poles</b> a uniformly distributed repressor activity {{that involves the}} Gro corepressor. Here, we identify a new gene, cic, {{that acts as a}} repressor of terminal genes regulated by the Tor pathway. cic also mediates repression along the dorsoventral axis, a process that requires the Dorsal morphogen and Gro, and which is also inhibited by Tor signaling at the termini. cic encodes an HMG-box transcription factor that interacts with Gro in vitro. We present evidence that Tor signaling regulates terminal patterning by inactivating Cic at the embryo poles. cic has been evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that Cic-like proteins may act as repressors regulated by RTK signaling in other organisms...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} characterization of D-raf-mediated signal transduction in the establishment and elaboration of pattern in Drosophila melanogaster. D- raf is the Drosophila homologue of the human Raf- 1 proto-oncogene. As {{a member of the}} Drosophila Torso (Tor) signal transduction cascade, D-raf acts to define cellular fates at the <b>embryonic</b> <b>poles.</b> Here we show that the serine/threonine kinase activity of D-raf is required for propagation of the Tor signal and that human Raf- 1 can substitute for D-raf in this pathway. We identified two serine phosphorylation sites (S 388 and S 743) and found that serine or its phosphorylation at site 743 is essential for D-raf function. Serine-to-alanine substitution at residue 388, amino-terminal truncation, or membrane-targeted D-raf resulted in constitutive, Tor-independent signal transduction at the <b>embryonic</b> <b>poles.</b> Membrane targeted D-raf, but not amino-terminal truncated or serine substituted D-raf (S 388 A), could induce the development of terminal structures in the center of embryos. Thus, localization of D-raf to the membrane appears to be an essential step in promoting Tor signal transduction in the embryonic center;We also found that maternal D-raf activation takes place between nuclear cycle 4 and 12 and zygotic expression of the D-raf gene occurs at nuclear cycle 13, 14, and blastoderm stages. Western blot analysis revealed that the accumulation of D-raf protein in embryos at 0 - 2 and 2 - 4 hours after egg laying was observed in wild-type embryos, and those derived from D-raf[superscript] 400 B 8, D-raf[superscript] C 2 Z 2, D-raf[superscript] DF 903, D-raf[superscript] raf 2, D-raf[superscript] PB 26 and D-raf[superscript] DC 817 but is absent from D-raf[superscript] 11 - 29, D-raf[superscript] EA 75, D-raf[superscript] 107, and D-raf[superscript] raf 1 mutant germlines. We also show that maternal D-raf[superscript] 400 B 8 and D-raf[superscript] C 2 Z 2 proteins exhibit dominant negative effects and these effects can be surpressed by a membrane targeted D-raf. This suggests that D-raf requires interaction with its substrate(s) at a membrane associated site...|$|R
40|$|In Drosophila, the {{maternal}} terminal system specifies cell fates at the <b>embryonic</b> <b>poles</b> via the localised {{stimulation of the}} Torso receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). Signalling by the Torso pathway relieves repression mediated by the Capicua and Groucho repressors, allowing the restricted expression of the zygotic terminal gap genes tailless and huckebein. Here we report a novel positive input into tailless and huckebein transcription by maternal posterior group genes, previously implicated in abdomen and pole cell formation. We show that absence of a subset of posterior group genes, or their overactivation, leads to the spatial reduction or expansion of the tailless and huckebein posterior expression domains, respectively. We demonstrate that the terminal and posterior systems converge, and that exclusion of Capicua from the termini of posterior group mutants is ineffective, accounting for reduced terminal gap gene expression in these embryos. We propose that the terminal and posterior systems function coordinately to alleviate transcriptional silencing by Capicua, and that the posterior system fine-tunes Torso RTK signalling output, ensuring precise spatial domains of tailless and huckebein expression...|$|R
50|$|Proper {{cytotrophoblast}} {{function is}} essential in the implantation of a blastocyst. After hatching, the <b>embryonic</b> <b>pole</b> of the blastocyst faces the uterine endometrium.

50|$|In humans, the {{placenta}} develops {{in the following}} manner. Chorionic villi (from the embryo) on the <b>embryonic</b> <b>pole</b> grow, forming chorion frondosum. Villi {{on the opposite side}} (abembryonic pole) degenerate and form the chorion laeve (or chorionic laevae), a smooth surface. The endometrium (from the mother) over the chorion frondosum (this part of the endometrium is called the decidua basalis) forms the decidual plate. The decidual plate is tightly attached to the chorion frondosum and goes on to form the actual placenta. Endometrium on the opposite side to the decidua basalis is the decidua parietalis. This fuses with the chorion laevae, thus filling up the uterine cavity.|$|E
50|$|In amniotes, {{the cells}} of the morula are at first closely aggregated, but soon they become {{arranged}} into an outer or peripheral layer, the trophoblast, which does not contribute to the formation of the embryo proper, and an inner cell mass, from which the embryo is developed. Fluid collects between the trophoblast and the greater part of the inner cell-mass, and thus the morula is converted into a vesicle, called the blastodermic vesicle. The inner cell mass remains in contact, however, with the trophoblast at one pole of the ovum; this is named the <b>embryonic</b> <b>pole,</b> since it indicates the location where the future embryo will be developed.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTheRaffamily of serine/threonine kinases are {{essential}} components in many receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signal transduction pathways. Here, we analyze {{the function of}} D-raf in the Torso (Tor) pathway required to specify cellular fates at the <b>embryonic</b> <b>poles.</b> Using mutant embryos lacking endogenous D-raf protein, we show that D-raf's serine/threonine kinase activity is essential for its role in Tor signal transduction and that human Raf- 1 will substitute for D-raf in this pathway. After Tor activation, D-raf becomes hyperphosphorylated. We identified two putative serine phosphorylation sites (S 388 and S 743) in SF 9 cells and demonstrate that S 743 or its phosphorylation is essential for D-raf function in embryos. Alanine substitution at S 388, N-terminal truncation, or targeted membrane association permits transmission of the Torso signal by D-raf, but these D-raf molecules differ in their rescuing potential and relative biological activity. Membrane-targeted D-raftor 4021 showed {{the highest level of}} activity, followed by alanine-substituted D-rafS 388 Aand N-terminal-truncated D-rafΔ 445. Since the activity profiles for these altered forms of D-raf are distinct, these findings indicate that each structural modification differentially affects the regulation and/or propagation of the Tor signal by these mutant D-raf proteins...|$|R

40|$|Dorsoventral (DV) axis {{formation}} in Drosophila begins with selective activation of EGFR, a {{receptor tyrosine kinase}} (RTK), in dorsal-anterior (DA) ovarian follicle cells. A critical event regulated by EGFR signaling is the repression of the sulfotransferase-encoding gene pipe in dorsal follicle cells, but how this occurs remains unclear. Here we show that Mirror (Mirr), a homeodomain transcription factor induced by EGFR signaling in DA follicle cells, directly represses pipe expression by binding to a conserved element in the pipe regulatory region. In addition, {{we find that the}} HMG-box protein Capicua (Cic) supports pipe expression in ventral follicle cells by repressing Mirr in this region. Interestingly, this role of Cic resembles its function in regulating anteroposterior (AP) body patterning, where Cic supports gap gene expression in central regions of the embryo by repressing Tailless, a repressor induced by RTK signaling at the <b>embryonic</b> <b>poles.</b> Thus, related RTK-Cic repressor circuits regulate the early stages of Drosophila DV and AP body axis formation.

50|$|The zygote first {{transformed}} into a morula through cleavage and then more divisions lead to a blastocyst that consisted of just a trophoblast, and an embryoblast. By {{the end of the}} first week, the embryoblast has begun separating into two layers: the epiblast and hypoblast also called the primitive endoderm. At the <b>embryonic</b> <b>pole</b> of the blastocyst, the amniotic cavity finds a home between the epiblast and the trophoblast. The epiblast stretches to surround the cavity very quickly and this layer of the epiblast becomes known as the amnion, which is one of the four extraembryonic membranes. The rest of the hypoblast and epiblast, not including the amnion, is what contributes to the bilaminar embryonic disc (bilaminar blastoderm/blastocyst), which sits between the amniotic cavity and the blastocyst cavity. The embryo proper and extramembryonic membranes are later derived from the embryonic disc.|$|E

In oocytes and early embryos, the Mab 46 F 11 antigen is sharply localized to the posterior <b>embryonic</b> <b>pole.</b> In pole cells, it becomes associated with nuclear bodies within, and nuage around, the nucleus.

40|$|In {{the shoot}} pole of Arabidopsis embryos, radial {{symmetry}} is broken by cotyledon specification. Subsequently, the radial {{pattern of the}} embryo axis is converted to bisymmetric. In a recent publication, we showed that distinct boundaries of hormonal signalling output specify the vascular pattern in the root meristem through a mutually inhibitory feedback loop between the hormones auxin and cytokinin. We observed that during embryogenesis, symmetry breakage in the root pole coincided with an influx of auxin from the cotyledons. In this manuscript, we provide genetic data to support {{the role of the}} cotyledons in initiating symmetry breaking in the <b>embryonic</b> root <b>pole.</b> Mutants with alterations in cotyledon number fail to establish bisymmetry in the embryo axis.

In contrast to classical studies that attribute {{the origin of the}} myocardial sinus horns to the <b>embryonic</b> venous <b>pole,</b> we find that the sinus horns form only after heart looping by differentiation of mesenchymal cells of the septum transversum region into myocardium. The myocardial sinus horns and their mesenchymal precursor cells never express Nkx 2 - 5, a transcription factor critical for heart development. In addition, lineage studies show that the sinus horns do not derive from cells previously positive for Nkx 2 - 5. In contrast, the sinus horns express the T-box transcription factor gene Tbx 18. Mice deficient for Tbx 18 fail to form sinus horns from the pericardial mesenchyme and have defective caval veins, whereas the pulmonary vein and atrial structures are unaffected.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of the embryonic axis in the Drosophila embryo relies on four maternal systems. Anterior and posterior axes rely on morphogens located at the poles that will generate a gradient of activity along the embryo. In contrast, terminal and dorsoventral system rely on cues that are generated by follicle cells in the egg chamber to induce the restricted activation of their receptors, Torso and Toll respectively. In {{the case of the}} terminal signaling, the torso (tor) gene encodes for a tyrosine kinase receptor uniformly localised all around the membrane of the embryo but exclusively activated at the poles upon the activity of the Torso-like (Tsl) protein. Restricted activation of the Torso receptor at the <b>embryonic</b> <b>poles</b> relies on the tsl gene. Indeed, Tsl is expressed at the poles of the egg chamber during oogenesis and, in embryogenesis, accumulates at both poles of the inner side of the vitelline membrane, the innermost eggshell layer, by means of three protein encoded by the Nasrat (f(s) N), Polehole (f(s) Ph) and Closca (clos) genes. f(s) N, f(s) Ph and clos encode for proteins that localise in the vitelline membrane and are involved in the crosslinking of the vitelline membrane converting the eggshell into a stiff and insoluble layer. Indeed, females bearing mutations in any of these genes produce collapsed eggs due to defects in their eggshell. fs(1) N 12, fs(1) ph 1901 and clos 1 are the only point mutation alleles which do not abolish the integrity of the vitelline membrane but cause the lack of terminal structures. The main objective of this work was to shed light on the role of Tsl, Nasrat, Polehole and Closca in ensuring restricted of Tor activation at the <b>embryonic</b> <b>poles.</b> In the case of Tsl, we found that, during oogenesis, it accumulates at the vitelline membrane while, in embryogenesis it localises {{at both ends of the}} embryonic plasma membrane probably at egg activation. These results suggest a a mechanism to transfer the Tsl from the egg chamber to the early embryo. This mechanism relies on the initial anchoring of Tsl at the vitelline membrane as it is secreted by the follicle cells, followed by its later translocation to the egg plasma membrane. In the case of Nasrat, Polehole and Closca,we found that embryo laid by fs(1) N 12, fs(1) ph 1901 and clos 1 mutant females display defects in dorsoventral patterning specification besides their terminal phenotype. Nasrat, Polehole and Closca, are required for proper anchorage and activity of Nudel, a protease acting both in embryonic dorsoventral patterning and vitelline membrane integrity, thus providing a mechanism for the role of Nasrat, Polehole and Closca in vitelline membrane cross linking and dorsoventral patterning. Therefore, the dorsoventral and terminal systems, hitherto considered independent, share a common extracellular mechanism constituted by the Nasrat, Polehole and Closca proteins. Moreover, we found that these proteins have a new Tsl-independent role in terminal signaling. In the embryonic terminal system, Tor is activated only at the poles by its ligand Trunk while, in Drosophila larvae, Tor is also expressed and activated by another ligand called Prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) in the Prothoracic Gland. Ectopic expression of PTTH in the embryo is able to activate Tor ectopically even in the absence of Tsl but requires Nasrat, Polehole and Closca. From these results, we propose that a Nasrat/Polehole/Closca complex acts as a multifunctional hub to anchor various proteins synthesized at oogenesis, ensuring their spatial and temporal restricted function. These findings shed light on the eggshell not just as protective layer but as a specialised extracellular matrix that regulates the spatial and temporal control of early embryonic developmental processes. El eje antero-posterior del embrión de Drosophila se especifica por acción de tres sistemas maternos: el sistema anterior, el sistema posterior y el sistema terminal. En el sistema terminal el receptor tirosina quinasa Torso (Tor) está localizado uniformemente en la membrana del embrión temprano pero se activa sólo en los polos por acción de la proteína Torso-like (Tsl). Aunque el papel de Tsl en la activación de Tor no está del todo claro, se ha descrito que Tsl es la única proteína de todo el sistema terminal localizada en los polos. De hecho, Tsl se acumula en la cara interna de la membrana vitelina (MV), anclado a las proteínas Nasrat, Polehole y Closca. El papel molecular de estas proteínas es poco conocido, pero análisis genéticos han demostrado que se necesitan para una correcta estructura de la MV y también para la activación de Tor. En esta tesis, nos hemos focalizado en la función de las proteínas Tsl, Nasrat, Polehole y Closca y su papel en la activación de Tor en los polos. Respecto a Tsl, descubrimos que esta proteína se acumula en la MV durante la oogénesis y, al principio de la embriogénesis, transloca de la MV a la membrana plasmática del embrión. En cuanto a Nasrat, Polehole y Closca descubrimos que estas proteínas se necesitan también para la correcta localización y función de Nudel, una proteína involucrada en la especificación del eje dorso ventral del embrión. Además encontramos que Nasrat, Polehole y Closca tienen una función adicional en el sistema terminal independiente de Tsl. De los resultados aquí descritos proponemos que un complejo formado por las proteínas Nasrat, Polehole y Closca podría funcionar en la MV como un centro multifuncional para anclar proteínas importantes por la especificación de los ejes del embrión...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDEAD-box {{proteins}} are ATP-dependent RNA helicases {{that function}} {{in various stages}} of RNA processing and in RNP remodeling. Here, we report identification and characterization of the Drosophila protein Belle (Bel), which belongs to a highly conserved subfamily of DEAD-box proteins including yeast Ded 1 p, Xenopus An 3, mouse PL 10, human DDX 3 /DBX, and human DBY. Mutations in DBY are a frequent cause of male infertility in humans. Bel can substitute in vivo for Ded 1 p, an essential yeast translation factor, suggesting a requirement for Bel in translation initiation. Consistent with an essential cellular function, strong loss of function mutations in bel are recessive lethal with a larval growth defect phenotype. Hypomorphic bel mutants are male-sterile. Bel is also closely related to the Drosophila DEAD-box protein Vasa (Vas), a germ line-specific translational regulator. We find that Bel and Vas colocalize in nuage and at the oocyte posterior during oogenesis, and that bel function is required for female fertility. However, unlike Vas, Bel is not specifically enriched in <b>embryonic</b> <b>pole</b> cells. We conclude that the DEAD-box protein Bel has evolutionarily conserved roles in fertility and development...|$|E
40|$|The maternally {{expressed}} Drosophila melanogaster DEAD-box helicase Vasa (Vas) {{is necessary}} for many cellular and developmental processes, including specification of primordial germ cells (pole cells), posterior patterning of the embryo, piRNA-mediated repression of transposon-encoded mRNAs, translational activation of gurken (grk) mRNA, and completion of oogenesis itself. Vas protein accumulates in the perinuclear nuage in nurse cells soon after their specification, and then at stage 10 Vas translocates to the posterior pole plasm of the oocyte. We produced a series of transgenic constructs encoding eGFP-Vas proteins carrying mutations affecting {{different regions of the}} protein, and analyzed in vivo which Vas functions each could support. We identified novel domains in the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein that are essential for localization, transposon repression, posterior patterning, and pole cell specification. One such functional region, the most C-terminal seven amino acids, is specific to Vas orthologues and is thus critical to distinguishing Vas from other closely related DEAD-box helicases. Surprisingly, we also found that many eGFP-Vas proteins carrying mutations that would be expected to abrogate DEAD-box helicase function localized to the nuage and posterior pole, and retained the capacity to support oogenesis, although they did not function in <b>embryonic</b> patterning, <b>pole</b> cell specification, grk activation, or transposon repression.

40|$|Skip to Next Section The Drosophila gene vasa is {{required}} for pole plasm assembly and function, and also for completion of oogenesis. To investigate the role of vasa in oocyte development, we generated a new null mutation of vasa, which deletes the entire coding region. Analysis of vasa-null ovaries revealed that the gene {{is involved in the}} growth of germline cysts. In vasa-null ovaries, germaria are atrophied, and contain far fewer developing cysts than do wild-type germaria; a phenotype similar to, but less severe than, that of a null nanos allele. The null mutant also revealed roles for vasa in oocyte differentiation, anterior-posterior egg chamber patterning, and dorsal-ventral follicle patterning, in addition to its better-characterized functions in posterior <b>embryonic</b> patterning and <b>pole</b> cell specification. The anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral patterning phenotypes resemble those observed in gurken mutants. vasa-null oocytes fail to efficiently accumulate many localized RNAs, such as Bicaudal-D, orb, oskar, and nanos, but still accumulate gurken RNA. However, GRK accumulation in the oocyte is severely reduced in the absence of vasa function, suggesting a function for VASA in activating gurken translation in wild-type ovaries...|$|R
40|$|The {{earliest}} step {{in heart}} formation in vertebrates occurs during gastrulation, when cardiac tissue is specified. Dorsoanterior endoderm {{is thought to}} provide a signal that induces adjacent mesodermal cells to adopt a cardiac fate. However, {{the nature of this}} signalling and the precise role of endoderm are unknown because of the close proximity and interdependence of mesoderm and endoderm during gastrulation. To better define the molecular events that underlie cardiac induction, we have sought to develop a simple means of inducing cardiac tissue. We show that the transcription factor GATA 4, which has been implicated in regulating cardiac gene expression, is sufficient to induce cardiac differentiation in Xenopus <b>embryonic</b> ectoderm (animal <b>pole)</b> explants, frequently resulting in beating tissue. Lineage labelling experiments demonstrate that GATA 4 can trigger cardiac differentiation not only in cells in which it is present, but also in neighbouring cells. Surprisingly, cardiac differentiation can occur without any stable differentiation of anterior endoderm and is in fact enhanced under conditions in which endoderm formation is inhibited. Remarkably, cardiac tissue is formed even when GATA 4 activity is delayed until long after explants have commenced differentiation into epidermal tissue. These findings provide a simple assay system for cardiac induction that may allow elucidation of pathways leading to cardiac differentiation. Better knowledge of the pathways governing this process may help develop procedures for efficient generation of cardiomyocytes from pluripotent stem cells...|$|R

40|$|The first cell {{differentiation}} in the mammalian embryo occurs during pre implantation development. At blastocyst stage two cell lineages can be distinguished: the {{inner cell mass}} (ICM), situated at the <b>embryonic</b> <b>pole</b> and the trophectoderm (TE) at the abembryonic pole. In murine embryos, {{it has been suggested}} that the first cleavage plane might be related with the embryonic-abembryonic (Em-Ab) axis at the blastocyst stage. So the daughter cells of the two-cell embryo might be already predisposed to a specific cell lineage further on development. The objective of the present thesis is to investigate the effects of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) factors affecting cell allocation patterns during pre implantation development. This was addressed by observing cell allocation patterns during mammalian pre implantation development on embryos produced using different ARTs. Using live-cell tracing, it has been concluded that cell allocation patterns during pre-implantation embryo development are potentially conserved among mammals, or at least among mouse and bovine embryos. Pre determined (orthogonal and deviant patterns), as well as stochastic development (random pattern), have been identified in mouse and bovine embryos. The incidence of these cell allocation patterns was not affected by maternal age, oocyte production, oocyte fertilisation/activation method, cleavage-stage biopsy or species. In addition, differences on epigenetic profiles, coping mechanisms after cell removal and further organ development were present among patterned embryos.

We have prolonged the culture period, usually by seven days. Although the embryo dies almost immediately during this extended culture period, the yolk sac continues to grow and reaches a diameter of approximately 2 cm; we have called this the giant yolk sac. The morphology of the giant yolk sac {{is very similar to}} that of control yolk sacs (17 1 / 2 or 18 1 / 2 days in vivo), the main difference being the greatly enlarged vacuolar volume in the endodermal cells of the giant yolk sac, which have been studied morphometrically. The pinocytic nature of the giant yolk sac has been demonstrated by its ability to take up colloidal gold. Its rate of uptake of 125 I-polyvinylpyrrolidone in whole serum gassed with 95 % O 2; 5 % CO 2 {{has been shown to be}} similar to the rate of uptake found in control yolk sacs under the same incubation conditions. Acid phosphatase activity was found to be similar in the giant yolk sac and control yolk sacs using both histochemical and biochemical methods. Giant yolk sacs without a contained dead embryo can be produced by removing the <b>embryonic</b> <b>pole</b> of the egg cylinder prior to incubation. They exhibit all the features detailed above. Finally it is shown that the fluid from within the extra-embryonic coelom of the giant yolk sac has some capacity to support the growth and development of 9 1 / 2 day rat embryos when a source of bulk protein is also provided. This model, therefore, seems to be very useful for the study of transport in a placental system. Its full potential requires further study...|$|E
40|$|The germ lineage {{has long}} been studied with {{interest}} because of its {{crucial role in the}} propagation and survival of a species. In Drosophila and several other species, the formation of the germ cell precursors, or “pole cells” is dependent on a specialized cytoplasm called the germ plasm, which contains RNAs and proteins that are required for <b>embryonic</b> patterning and <b>pole</b> cell formation. The components of the germ plasm have been studied extensively with interest in identifying specific determinants of germ cell formation. Germ cell-less (gcl) appears to be one such determinant. It {{has been shown to be}} maternally required specifically for proper pole cell formation. However, little has been understood about its cellular role in this process. In this thesis, I present a multi-pronged approach we have taken to understand the role of this factor in germ cell specification. First, we have undertaken a study of gcl in mouse to determine whether its function in germ cell specification is evolutionarily conserved. Second, we have explored in greater depth the unusual distribution of GCL protein at the nuclear periphery in Drosophila pole cells. Third, the role of gcl in a conserved feature of the early germline, transcriptional quiescence, has been examined. And fourth, protein binding partners of GCL have been identified and studied. Through these studies, we have gained evidence to conclude that the cellular role of GCL in the early Drosophila embryo is to silence transcription, possibly by associating with chromatin binding proteins. We hypothesize that the translocation of chromatin to GCL at the periphery of the nucleus is an essential part of the mechanism by which silencing occurs. Through studies of mouse gcl- 1, we conclude that gcl does not appear to be a conserved germ cell determinant, but it does have a broader conserved function in chromatin silencing and remodeling. ...|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms of post-transcriptional {{control are}} {{critical}} to deploy RNAs and proteins asymmetrically to a discrete region of cytoplasm at the posterior of the Drosophila oocyte and embryo, called the pole plasm and thus allow differentiation of the germline. Research presented in this thesis investigates the post-transcriptional control of Drosophila pole plasm component germ cell-less (gcl). Maternal gcl activity is required for germ cell specification and gcl RNA and protein accumulate asymmetrically in the pole plasm. gcl RNA, but not Gcl protein, is also detected in somatic regions of the embryo, and ectopic expression of Gcl in the soma causes repression of somatic patterning genes suggesting that gcl RNA is subject to translational control. I find that Gcl is expressed during oogenesis, where its expression is regulated by translational repressor Bruno (Bru). Increased levels of Gcl are observed in the oocyte when Bru is reduced (i. e., in an arrest heterozygote) and Bru overexpression reduces the amount of Gcl. Consistent with this, reduction of the maternal dosage of Bru leads to ectopic Gcl expression in the embryo, which, in turn, causes repression of anterior huckebein RNA expression. Bruno binds directly to the gcl 3 'UTR in vitro, but surprisingly, this binding is largely independent of a Bruno Response Element (BRE) in the gcl 3 'UTR and depends upon a novel site. Furthermore, the gcl BRE-like region {{is not required to}} repress Gcl expression during oogenesis or embryogenesis. I concluded that Bru regulates gcl translation in a BRE-independent manner. In addition, I established the role of the gcl 3 'UTR in gcl RNA localization and translation using transgenes that replace the endogenous 3 'UTR with the alpha-tubulin 3 'UTR or place it in tandem to the bicoid 3 'UTR. I find that accumulation of gcl RNA in the <b>embryonic</b> <b>pole</b> plasm requires the gcl 3 'UTR. Moreover, Gel is restricted to the pole plasm by translational repression mediated by the gcl 3 'UTR and a limiting pool of trans-acting translational repressors. The phenotypic consequences of loss of this translational control are relatively mild, suggesting that gcl translation does not require stringent repression in the soma...|$|E
40|$|The zona-pellucida (zona, ZP) is an adhesion-refractory, {{acellular}} coat enclosing {{the rapidly}} growing, free-living mammalian preimplantation embryo which undergoes successive cleavage divisions {{to form the}} blastocyst, composed of ICM-cells surrounded by outer TE-cells. For further development, the blastocyst must ‘hatch’ or ‘escape’ out of the zona before it can implant into the endometrium for further development (Fig. 5. 1 A). Hence, the event of hatching or ‘zona escape’ assumes critical importance {{for the establishment of}} a successful pregnancy. The golden-hamster blastocyst offers a very unique paradigm to understand hatching, whereby upon attainment of a fully-expanded state, the blastocyst undergoes a dramatic (and molecularly unexplained) deflation event, followed by appearance of TE-derived dynamic cellular projections called TE-projections, whose appearance in an embryonic-stage and -time dependant manner suggest an intimate association with the hatching phenomenon (Fig. 5. 1 B). Thirdly, embryo-derived zonalytic proteases have been shown to bring about a focal-lysis of the ZP followed by global zona dissolution. Earlier work in the laboratory had demonstrated the intimate involvement of signaling molecules like LIF, HB-EGF, TGF-β and (ER) -α with hatching (Seshagiri et al., 2002, 2009). Investigations also revealed the involvement of cysteine-proteases of the cathepsin (cts) family, especially cts-L, -B and-P to be involved in zona lysis (Sireesha et al., 2008). In order to achieve a better understanding of mammalian preimplantation development, especially hatching, it was important to investigate the role and impact of other critical regulators of developmental and reproductive physiology. COX- 2 is one such key signaling moiety and it was decided to investigate the role, if any, of COX- 2 and its derived PGs in hamster peri-implantation events. COX- 2 transcripts and immunoreactive COX- 2 protein were detected in the different preimplantation stages, from 8 -cell onwards. COX- 2 protein was abundant in both the ICM and TE, but was especially enriched in the TE-cells of the late blastocyst. In order to investigate the function of this enzyme in preimplantation development and hatching, two very-specific inhibitors of COX- 2 catalytic action, NS- 398 and CAY- 10404, were tested in identical concentrations of 25, 50 and 75 μM on in vitro cultured hamster blastocysts. In order to assess the impact of COX- 2 inhibition on an embryo-stage and time-dependant manner, inhibitors were tested on freshly recovered 8 -cell embryos or early blastocysts, continuously for 72 h or 48 h, respectively. COX- 2 -selective inhibitors inhibited hamster blastocyst hatching in a dose-dependant manner with maximum inhibition observed in the 75 μM dose. Surprisingly, there was a profound dose-dependent failure of deflation of late-blastocysts upon inhibitor treatment and embryos which hatched, did so in an inflated state and retained intact zonae in cultures. Moreover, embryos subjected to NS- 398 treatment phenocopied those subjected to CAY- 10404 treatment. Results demonstrate that the effect of inhibitors, and hence the need for COX- 2 mediated signaling events is more pronounced in 8 ¬cell embryos than with early-blastocysts, indicating that COX- 2 dependant molecular and cellular processes required for blastocyst morphogenesis and ZP-lysis may have been initiated prior to compaction and cavitation. The reversal of effects of COX- 2 inhibition on hatching with exogenous addition of PGE 2 and Iloprost (a stable PGI 2 analogue) to inhibitor cultures, show that COX- 2 -derived eicosanoids could, in effect bring about hamster hatching, which is in agreement with previous reports (Davis et al., 1999) and augment peri-implantation development including hatching (Huang et al., 2003). Additionally, it has been successfully demonstrated that PGE 2 was superior to PGI 2 in augmenting blastocyst hatching in inhibitor-cultures. In this study, the modulation of critical cts-L, -B, -P proteases in COX- 2 mediated hamster zona hatching has been verified by quantifying cts in transcripts in control and inhibitor-subjected embryonic samples which was further substantiated by the decreased intra-embryonal protein levels of cts-L and -P. These results demonstrate that COX- 2 mediated signaling components directly and effectively modulate hamster preimplantation development, especially zona-hatching phenomenon by transcriptional-regulation of the critical zonalytic proteases. Another potential hatching-associated molecule i. e., NF-κB which is known to exert a great deal of influence on overall reproductive and developmental biology, was investigated in this study. Its specific effects on mammalian preimplantation development, especially hatching, remain totally uninvestigated. This formed the rationale to investigate the reach and impact of NF-κB signaling network in the modulation of peri-hatching events. Transcripts and immunoreactive NF-κB protein of crucial pathway-components like IKK, IκB-β and RelA were detected from 8 -cell embryo to the zona-free blastocyst. In order to ascertain the impact of NF-κB signaling on peri-hatching events, two very-specific inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway, BAY- 11 - 7082 and JSH- 23 were employed which acted at two strategic signaling points. In order to assess the impact of NF-κB inhibition on an embryo-stage and time-dependant manner, inhibitors were tested on freshly recovered 8 -cell embryos or early blastocysts, continuously for 72 h or 48 h, respectively. NF-κB-selective inhibitors inhibited blastocyst hatching in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, a profound dose-dependent failure of deflation of late-blastocysts upon inhibitor treatment was observed and embryos which hatched did so in an inflated state and also retained intact zonae in cultures. Moreover, embryos subjected to BAY- 11 - 7082 treatment phenocopied those subjected to JSH- 23 treatment, indicating specificity of inhibitor action. Time-course experiments demonstrated that the need for efficient NF-κB mediated signaling is distinctively more for 8 -cell embryos than early-blastocysts, indicating that NF-κB dependant molecular and cellular processes required for blastocyst morphogenesis and ZP-lysis may have been initiated prior to compaction and cavitation. Moreover, modulation of zonalysins cts-L, -B and -P by NF-κB-signaling, during the event of zona lysis, both by real-time quantitation of its transcripts and intracellular protein levels has been demonstrated. These results demonstrate that NF¬κB mediated signaling components directly and effectively modulate hamster preimplantation development, especially zona-hatching phenomenon by transcriptional-regulation of the critical zonalytic proteases. The profound inhibition of hatching and effects on blastocyst morphogenesis observed by inhibition of COX- 2 and NF-κB signaling systems demonstrate a fundamental need of the growing embryo for these critical signaling moieties. Moreover, the underlying similarity of consequences obtained upon inhibition of both signaling networks i. e., NF-κB and COX- 2, perhaps indicate a linear mode of signaling between these principles. It remains to be tested, though, if it really is the case. A striking observation made in this study was the detection of immunoreactive signals for critical signaling moieties like ER-α, COX- 2 and RelA onto TEPs of the deflated hamster blastocyst, in addition to earlier TEP-localisation of cathepsins. A B C (Figure) ENDOMETRIUM ENDOMETRIUM ENDOMETRIUM Fig 5. 1. Schematic representation of the role of molecular and cellular factors in the regulation of concordant phenomena of mammalian blastocyst hatching and endometrial implantation. (A) Depicts a zona-intact well-formed blastocyst. Preimplantation embryo development and blastocyst formation involves close cooperation between several molecular principles (discussed in sections 1. 3. 1 to 1. 3. 3), (B) as the embryo prepares to hatch, prior to implantation, it initiates egression from the non-adhesive ZP coat by cathepsin (cts) protease-mediated lysis of zona (pink circles); there is concomitant appearance of cellular principles such as TEPs (undulating projections shown in green). Of interest is the intimate association of hatching-promoting molecules such as COX- 2, NF-κB, ER-α, Cts etc. with the TEPs. (C) depicts a zona-free, TEP-rich blastocyst initiating implantation into the maternal endometrium. It is possible, that the embryonic TEPs with the associated hatching-regulatory molecules are also critical for implantation phenomena during the embryo-maternal recognition and implantation during the establishment of early pregnancy. Preliminary results indicate that TEPs could be the site of membrane lipid-rafts, focal points of membrane-based signaling. The definitive role of TEPs in peri-hatching events is yet to be confirmed, but it is presumed that these actin-based undulating structures, harboring several key molecules involved in peri-implantation events in the embryo as well as the maternal uterus could be instrumental in successfully bringing about the concomitant processes of hatching and implantation. Interestingly, during rodent implantation (hamster, guinea-pig, mouse and rat), the blastocyst orients in such a way that the ICM is oriented away from the endometrium and, at least in the hamster, the TEP-carrying abembryonic (mural) pole remains closest to the luminal epithelium (LE) (Gonzales et al., 1996 b; Seshagiri et al., 2009; Fig. 5. 1 C). In contrast, in humans and other primates, the <b>embryonic</b> <b>pole</b> is closest to LE before implantation (Kirby, 1971; Lee and DeMayo, 2004). Although direct evidence is lacking, but these observations gives rise to a possibility that both hatching and implantation could be intimately related to the polar appearance of TEPs in the embryo. Several key signaling molecules like ER-α, LIF, HB-EGF and TGF-β have been already demonstrated to play crucial roles in mammalian hatching. In this thesis, we have exemplified the need for COX- 2 mediated prostanoid signaling and the pleotropic NF-κB signaling system in bringing about mammalian blastocyst hatching. How exactly do these molecular entities communicate among themselves and with cellular principles like TEPs thereby effectively enabling peri-implantation development, remain to be understood. Taken together, these results demonstrate, for the first time, the involvement of embryo-derived signaling molecules, like COX- 2 and NF-κB in an embryo stage-and time-dependant manner in mammalian peri-implantation events, especially blastocyst hatching. The association of TEPs with key molecules common to embryonic and maternal preparation for hatching and implantation, respectively, indicates towards a molecular and cellular continuity between the concomitant events. These fundamental findings on hamster blastocyst biology have profound clinical implications in the management of human infertility. (For figures pl see the abstract file) ...|$|E
