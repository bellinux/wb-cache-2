DeSimone, a 30-year maritime industry veteran to serve as Chief Operating Officer for the Staten Island Ferry and shortly thereafter appointed Margaret Gordon a maritime safety and security expert to serve as Executive Director of Safety and Security at the ferry. In October 2005, after a year long effort {{to develop and implement}} a comprehensive safety management system for the Staten Island Ferry, the American Bureau of Shipping presented the Department of Transportation with a [...] "Voluntary <b>Document</b> <b>of</b> <b>Compliance</b> Certificate" [...] for the DOT Staten Island Ferry Division and [...] "Voluntary Safety Management Certificates" [...] for all operational ferryboats. The New York City Department of Transportation is now the first ferry operator in the United States to voluntarily comply with this internationally accepted safety regime.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} generation, the ISM code has brought forth {{tremendous}} opportunities {{to investigate and}} enhance the human factor in shipping through the implementation of Safety Management Systems. One of the critical factors to this implementation has been mandatory compliance and a requirement for obtaining a <b>Document</b> <b>of</b> <b>Compliance</b> (DOC) for vessels operating globally or at least internationally. A primary objective of these systems is to maintain them as “living” or “dynamic” systems that are always evolving. As the ISM code has evolved, there have been instances where large organizations have opted to maintain a voluntary DOC from their respective class society. This has been accomplished with a large human factor element as typically an organizational culture does not always accept change readily especially {{if there is not}} a legal requirement to do so. In other words, when considering maritime training is it possible that organizations may represent cultural challenges? The intent of this paper will be to research large maritime operations that have opted for a <b>document</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> voluntarily and compare them to similar organizations that have been mandated by international law to do the same. The result should be to gain insight into the human factors that must contribute to a culture change in the organization for the purposes of a legal requirement versus the human factors that contribute to a voluntary establishment of a safety management system. This analysis will include both the executive decision making that designs a system implementation and the operational sector that must execute its implementation. All success and failures of education and training can be determined by the outcome. Did the training achieve its goal? Or has the education prepared the students to embrace a new idea in conjunction with a company goal or a new regulatory scheme? In qualifying the goal of a successful ISM integration by examining both mandatory and voluntary ISM implementation in large maritime operations, specifically ferry systems, hopefully we can learn from the various factors that have gone into each...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} {{measuring}} {{the performance of}} registries has been a topic of policy discussions in recent years at the regional level due to the recasting of the European Union (EU) port state control (PSC) directive which introduces incentives for flags which perform better. Since the current method used in the EU region entails some shortcomings, it has therefore {{been the subject of}} substantial scrutiny. Furthermore, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) developed a set of performance indicators which however lacks the ability to measure compliance as set out in one of its strategic directions towards fostering global compliance. This article develops a methodology to measure flag state performance which can be applied on the regional or global level and to other areas of legislative interest (e. g. recognized organizations, <b>Document</b> <b>of</b> <b>Compliance</b> Companies). The proposed methodology overcomes some of the shortcomings of the present method and presents a more refined, less biased approach of measuring performance.

40|$|AbstractA {{decade after}} the passage of Republic Act 9003, {{otherwise}} known as the Philippine Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, an in-depth and year-long analysis of its successes and remaining gaps is undertaken. The National Solid Waste Management Commission (NSWMC) has gathered experts and practitioners to <b>document</b> the status <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> to the law by local government units and diagnose the issues and barriers affecting its implementation. With support from Solid Waste Management for Local Government Units (SWM 4 LGUs) Project being implemented by AHT GROUP AG on behalf of the German International Cooperation Agency (GIZ), the NSWMC has developed the National Solid Waste Management Strategy for the years 2012 to 2016. The Strategy consists of ten (10) components, namely: Bridging policy gaps and harmonizing policies, Capacity development, social marketing and advocacy, Sustainable financing, Creating economic opportunities, Knowledge management on technologies and innovation, Organizational development and enhancing inter-agency cooperation, Compliance monitoring, enforcement and recognition, Good governance, Caring for vulnerable groups, and Reducing disaster and climate change risks. Each is defined by key initiatives, which are further elaborated with objectives, indicative actions, justifications, responsible entities, time frame, target groups and resource requirements.

40|$|This study aims {{to provide}} {{findings}} indicating {{trends in the}} level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with the goodwill accounting by firms in Russia and Kazakhstan. Also the present paper seeks to establish {{whether there was a}} difference in the level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> between Russian and Kazakhstan firms. This study also intends to identify firm-specific factors that are associated with the level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> by firms in these countries. IFRS-compliant financial reports of 37 Russian and 17 Kazakhstan companies which disclosed the existence of goodwill were investigated. The level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> was measured by comparing actual disclosures made by firms with those required by IAS 36. The results indicate a generally improving trend in the level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> by Russian and Kazakhstan firms. However, findings suggest the existence of an unwillingness to comply with IAS 36 requirements by managers in those countries. Also the results show a higher level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> by Russian firms compared to that of Kazakhstan companies which may be attributed to contrasting approaches to IFRS adoption in Russia and Kazakhstan. Research findings provide evidence of a positive association of the level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> by Russian firms with firm goodwill intensity. The level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> by Kazakhstan firms appears to be positively associated with firm size. The research suggests a lack <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> enforcement in Russia and Kazakhstan. Policy makers in Russia may consider firm goodwill intensity and policy makers in Kazakhstan firm size factors when addressing problem of non-compliance. The difference in the level <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> between Russian and Kazakhstan firms may add to the discussion concerning pros and cons of different strategies of IFRS adoption and as such may be useful for transitional countries considering the adoption of IFRS...|$|R

40|$|Background and Discussion: The {{adoption}} of the IFRS by Swedish companies was an arduous task which required {{a lot of resources}} and time. The regulations that the IFRS contain are more complex and require more extensive disclosures than Swedish companies are used to. It can be a difficult task for companies to comply with IAS 36 disclosure requirements {{and at the same time}} not to disclose too much of a company’s specific information. The importance of disclosure should not be underestimated, as more disclosures lead to lower cost of capital. Recent studies show that disclosures about goodwill impairment testing provided by companies are too general and not sufficient to enable users of financial statements to assess the reliability of goodwill impairment testing. Research Question: The research question of this thesis is to what extent company characteristics may explain the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with disclosure requirements in paragraph 134 of IAS 36. In order to measure the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance,</b> the examination <b>of</b> goodwill impairment accounting practices has been conducted. Methodology: The research question has been addressed using an empirical approach with an emphasis on note-form disclosures in the 2011 and 2011 / 2012 consolidated financial statements of Swedish firms listed on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm. This study has examined relationships between company-specific, institutional and goodwill-related company characteristics and degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with disclosure requirements in paragraph 134 of IAS 36 with the help of multiple regression analysis. The degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> in this study is measured by a self-constructed index. Results and conclusions: The study has shown that a combination of examined company characteristics explain only about 9 % of the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with disclosure requirements in paragraph 134 of IAS 36. Regarding company-specific characteristics, this study has indicated that company size has a significant impact of the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with disclosure requirements as larger companies seem to have a higher degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance.</b> No significant relationships between company performance and degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> as well as between financial needs and degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> have been found in this study. The study has further indicated that degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with disclosure requirements regarding goodwill impairment tests varies across industries and auditor firms. Finally, the results of this study show that goodwill-related characteristics do not seem to have a significant impact on the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> with disclosure requirements, as no significant relationships between the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> and the amount of goodwill on the balance sheet of the company and the degree <b>of</b> <b>compliance</b> and the goodwill impairment rate were found...|$|R
