Kung Fu follows Gorgeous as {{she leaves the}} room, only to find Sweet's body trapped in a {{grandfather}} clock. Panic-driven, the remaining girls barricade {{the upper part of}} the house while Prof, Fantasy and Kung Fu read the aunt's diary. They are interrupted by the giant-sized head of Gorgeous. Gorgeous reveals that her aunt died many years ago waiting for her fiancée to return from World War II and that her spirit remains, eating unmarried girls who arrive at her home. The three girls are then attacked by household items. Prof shouts to Kung Fu to attack the aunt's cat, Blanche. As Kung Fu lunges into a flying kick, she is eaten by a possessed light fixture. Kung Fu's legs manage to escape and attack the painting of Blanche on the wall. The attacked Blanche portrait spurts blood, causing the room to flood.

25|$|As fashions {{changed over}} time, the Quaker ideal of plain dress stood out against {{contemporary}} clothing.

25|$|According to a meta-analysis, it was {{discovered}} that direct lobbying is used alongside grassroots lobbying. There is evidence that groups {{are much more likely to}} directly lobby previous allies rather than opponents. Allies are also directly lobbied if a counter lobby is brought to light. The results suggest that groups lobby in ways designed obtain the most influence for their view. When groups have strong ties to a legislator's district, those groups will use a combination of grassroots and direct lobbying, even if the legislator's original position does not support theirs, which may help groups expand their supportive coalitions. When strong district ties are not present, groups tend to rely on direct lobbying with committee allies, because they assume that their political <b>friends</b> <b>will</b> be drawn to participate with the lobbyist view.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 2000s, NBC's {{fortunes}} started to take a rapid turn for the worse. That year, NBC's longstanding ratings lead ended as CBS (which had languished in the ratings after losing the NFL) overtook it for first place. In 2001, CBS chose to move its hit reality series Survivor to serve as the anchor of its Thursday night lineup. Its success was taken as a suggestion that NBC's nearly two decades of dominance on Thursday nights could be broken; even so, the strength of <b>Friends,</b> <b>Will</b> & Grace, ER and Just Shoot Me! (the latter of which saw its highest viewership following its move to that night in the 2000–01 season) helped the network continue to lead the Thursday ratings. Overall, NBC retook its first place lead that year, and spent much of the next four years (with the exception of the 2002–03 season, when it was briefly jumped again by CBS for first) in the top spot.|$|E

500|$|On 9 November 1889, a {{large number}} of {{officers}} gathered in the Military Club and decided to stage a coup d'état aimed at the overthrow of the monarchy. Two days later in the house of Rui Barbosa a plan to execute the coup was drawn up by officers who included Benjamin Constant and Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca, plus two civilians: Quintino Bocaiúva and Aristides Lobo. It was the only significant meeting in which civilian republicans participated, as Deodoro wished to exclude them from what he considered to be a strictly military matter. Deodoro still hesitated: [...] "I wanted to follow the Emperor's coffin, who is old and whom I deeply respect." [...] But he eventually yielded to pressure: [...] "He [...] wants it thus, let us make the Republic.

Batman appears in brief flashbacks where he is involved in the capture of Deadshot and Harley Quinn, rescuing Harley from a submerged car after it crashed during a chase and she was abandoned by the Joker, and apprehending Deadshot after an anonymous tip led him to the assassin as Deadshot was Christmas-shopping with his daughter. Batman's history with Killer Croc is also briefly referenced.
