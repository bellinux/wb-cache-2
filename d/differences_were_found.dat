5|$|In the 1980s, the {{availability}} of fresh specimens of the fungus—collected by Australian mycologist Bruce A. Fuhrer from the cones of Banksia spinulosa—prompted Gordon Beaton and Gretna Weste to reexamine the previous collections. Various apparent and microscopic <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> which suggested that three distinct species were represented in the collections, and further, the species differed enough from other Encoelia species to warrant {{the creation of a}} new genus, which Beaton and Weste named Banksiamyces. The three Banksiamyces species they described in 1982 were the original B.toomansis (those initially named T.toomansis), as well as B.macrocarpus and B.katerinae. A fourth species, B.maccannii, was added to the genus by the same authors in 1984. A 2006 study identified two additional taxa that did not quite meet the description for previously published species; these have been called Banksiamyces aff. macrocarpus and Banksiamyces aff. toomansis. Some existing species were found on other banksia species, so evidence strengthened that the individual Banksiamyces fungi did not exclusively parasitize only one banksia species, a suggestion proposed by Beaton and Weste in 1982.|$|E
5|$|In a 2015 study, {{high-quality}} genome sequences {{from three}} Asian elephants and two woolly mammoths were compared. Approximately 1.4 million DNA nucleotide <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> between mammoths and elephants, which affect {{the sequence of}} more than 1,600 proteins. Differences were noted in genes {{for a number of}} aspects of physiology and biology that would be relevant to Arctic survival, including development of skin and hair, storage and metabolism of adipose tissue, and perceiving temperature. Genes related to both sensing temperature and transmitting that sensation to the brain were altered. One of the heat-sensing genes encodes a protein, TRPV3, found in skin which also affects hair growth. When inserted into human cells, the mammoth's version of the protein was found to be less sensitive to heat than the elephant's. This is consistent with a previous observation that mice lacking active TRPV3 are likely to spend more time in cooler cage locations than wild type mice, and have wavier hair. There were also several alterations in circadian clock genes, perhaps needed to cope with the extreme polar variation in length of daylight. Similar mutations are known in other Arctic mammals, such as reindeer.|$|E

25|$|While {{there exist}} strong {{stereotypes}} that women express themselves {{and talk about}} their emotions with others more than men do, {{the results from the}} above studies indicate that on the contrary there are no sex differences concerning the amount of social sharing of emotion between men and women. However, although no such quantitative sex <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found,</b> one qualitative difference was found between the social sharing behaviors of males and females, and that is with whom they choose to share. Females tend to share their emotions equally between family members, close friends, and spouses/partners. On the other hand, men tend to share more exclusively with their partners/spouses and less so with close friends and family members.|$|E
25|$|A {{study from}} 2013 {{provided}} brain imaging evidence that human responses to fear chemosignals may be gender-specific. Researchers collected alarm-induced sweat and exercise-induced sweat from donors extracted it, pooled it and {{presented it to}} 16 unrelated people undergoing functional brain MRI. While stress-induced sweat from males produced a comparably strong emotional response in both females and males, stress-induced sweat from females produced a markedly stronger arousal in women than in men. Statistical tests pinpointed this gender-specificity to the right amygdala and strongest in the superficial nuclei. Since no significant <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> in the olfactory bulb, the response to female fear-induced signals is likely based on processing the meaning, i.e. on the emotional level, rather than the strength of chemosensory cues from each gender, i.e. the perceptual level.|$|E

While later studies conducted in Netherlands, Italy, and Spain produced similar results to the first studies, the question of whether social sharing exists in non-Western cultures. The first intercultural study compared Dutch subjects to Turkish and Surinamese immigrants, and the findings showed that social sharing was a prominent behavior in each group, although slightly less so for the Surinamese subjects. Other studies comparing Western and Eastern cultures produced similar results, finding that Eastern cultures had slightly lower rates of social sharing. Furthermore, several general qualitative <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> between Western and Eastern populations.

25|$|Obsidian {{can be used}} to make {{extremely}} sharp knives, and obsidian blades are a type {{of glass}} knife made using naturally occurring obsidian instead of manufactured glass. Obsidian is used by some surgeons for scalpel blades, although this is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use on humans. Well-crafted obsidian blades, as with any glass knife, can have a cutting edge many times sharper than high-quality steel surgical scalpels, the cutting edge of the blade being only about 3 nanometers thick. Even the sharpest metal knife has a jagged, irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope; when examined even under an electron microscope an obsidian blade is still smooth and even. One study found that obsidian incisions produced fewer inflammatory cells and less granulation tissue at seven days, in a group of rats, although no <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> after 21 days. Don Crabtree produced obsidian blades for surgery and other purposes, and has written articles on the subject. Obsidian scalpels may currently be purchased for surgical use on research animals.|$|E
25|$|One small 2009 {{double-blind}} study of autistic children found that 40 hourly treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres provided {{significant improvement in}} the children's behavior immediately after treatment sessions but this study has not been independently confirmed. More recent, relatively large-scale controlled studies have also investigated HBOT using treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres and have found less promising results. A 2010 {{double-blind study}} compared HBOT to a placebo treatment in children with autistic disorder. Both direct observational measures of behavioral symptoms and standardized psychological assessments were {{used to evaluate the}} treatment. No <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> between the HBOT group and the placebo group on any of the outcome measures. A second 2011 single-subject design study also investigated the effects of 40 HBOT treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres on directly observed behaviors using multiple baselines across 16 participants. Again, no consistent outcomes were observed across any group and further, no significant improvements were observed within any individual participant. Together these studies suggest that HBOT at 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheric pressure does not result in a clinically significant improvement of the behavioral symptoms of autistic disorder.|$|E
