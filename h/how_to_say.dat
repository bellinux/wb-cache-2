25|$|The {{view that}} {{sexuality}} is victimization teaches girls {{to be careful}} of being sexually victimized and taken advantage of. Educators who hold this perspective encourage sexual education, but focus on teaching girls <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no, teaching them of the risks of being victims and educate them about risks and diseases of being sexually active. This perspective teaches adolescents that boys are predators and that girls are victims of sexual victimization. Researchers state that this perspective does not address the existence of desire within girls, does not address the societal variables that influence sexual violence and teaches girls to view sex as dangerous only before marriage. In reality, sexual violence can be very prevalent within marriages too.|$|E
