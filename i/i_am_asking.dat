The song ends with a quote from the Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was naked and you gave me clothing.

500|$|I am very {{grateful}} that my show was so well received {{all over the}} world. But {{there seems to be}} many misinterpretations about my appearance on the cross and I wanted to explain it myself once and for all. There is a segment in my show where three of my dancers 'confess' or share harrowing experiences from their childhood that they ultimately overcame. My 'confession' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I ultimately come down from. This is not a mocking of the church. It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous. Rather, it is my plea to the audience to encourage mankind to help one another and to see the world as a unified whole. I believe in my heart that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same thing. My specific intent is to bring attention to the millions of children in Africa who are dying every day, and are living without care, without medicine and without hope. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>asking</b> people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can.

I was sick and you took care of me and God replied, [...] "Whatever you did for the least of my brothers... you did it to me.' Please do not pass judgement without seeing my show.|$|E

2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>asking</b> you to {{go because}} of my desire {{to have the best}} {{possible}} on-the-spot appraisal of the military and paramilitary effort to defeat the Viet Cong[...] [...] [...] The events in South Vietnam since May have now raised serious questions both about the present prospects for success against the Viet Cong and still more about the future effectiveness of this effort unless there can be important political improvement in the country. It is in this context that I now need your appraisal of the situation. If the prognosis in your judgment is not hopeful, I would like your views on what action must be taken by the South Vietnamese Government and what steps our Government should take to lead the Vietnamese to that action.|$|E

2500|$|The {{promotion}} {{of research to}} make screening programs find ever more cancers is also criticized. One-third of diagnosed breast cancers might recede on their own. In addition to efficiently finding most deadly cancers, screening programs also find most non-life-threatening, asymptomatic breast cancers and pre-cancers, and miss some fast growing, aggressive, dangerous cancers. According to H. Gilbert Welch of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, [...] "I'm certainly not asking anyone to stop getting mammograms. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>asking</b> my profession to tell women the truth about overdiagnosis." [...] Welch said that research on screening mammography has taken the [...] "brain-dead approach that says the best test {{is the one that}} finds the most cancers" [...] rather than the one that finds dangerous cancers.|$|E

[...] Teammate Chris Johnson said of the other backs, [...] "Basically if you have the talent to make it here, you pretty much know how to read a defense and know how to run a ball, So there are not a lot of things I can tell him as far as how to run the ball. ... (It's) just making sure I let him know some of the things I did to learn the playbook quickly." ...|$|E
