5|$|In 1990, {{following}} the electoral {{defeat of the}} government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, <b>ethnic</b> <b>tensions</b> between Croats and Serbs worsened. Serbian President Slobodan Milošević used Franjo Tuđman's actions to his advantage, portraying the Croatian leader and his Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) as a reincarnation of the Ustaše, a fascist movement that had ruled Croatia during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|After the 1990 electoral {{defeat of}} the {{government}} of the Socialist Republic of Croatia <b>ethnic</b> <b>tensions</b> between Croats and Croatian Serbs worsened, and the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija, or JNA) confiscated Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana, or TO) weapons to minimize resistance. On 17 August an open revolt broke out among the Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland near Knin and parts of Lika, Kordun, Banovina and Slavonia.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the past}} century, the Dagomba have faced {{repeated}} succession disputes and conflict. Following {{the death of}} Ya-Na Mahama II in 1954, a succession dispute erupted into violence. The federal government sent troops to Yendi and intervened to decide the succession. <b>Ethnic</b> <b>tension</b> has also plagued northern Ghana. Violence flared between the Dagomba and their Konkomba subjects over land use and ownership in 1914, 1917, the 1940s and the 1980s. During the 1990s <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension</b> once again racked the region. Twelve {{people were killed in}} Tamale in 1994 when police fired on a group of Dagomba who had attacked some Konkomba.|$|R

5|$|The {{situation}} {{became quite}} tense {{with each of}} the sides making threats and refusing to meet with each other. Maga threatened that the north would secede if his victory was not validated, and Apithy threatened that his base of Porto-Novo would join with Nigeria. <b>Ethnic</b> <b>tensions</b> increased with these threats and with mass migration of people back to their traditional ethnic territories. Many inside the country considered Dahomey to be close to civil war.|$|E
5|$|With the {{expansion}} of railroad and industrial jobs in meatpacking, Omaha attracted many new immigrants and migrants. As the major city in Nebraska, it has historically been more racially and ethnically diverse {{than the rest of}} the state. At times rapid population change, overcrowded housing and job competition have aroused racial and <b>ethnic</b> <b>tensions.</b> Around the start of the 20th century, violence towards new immigrants in Omaha often erupted out of suspicions and fears.|$|E

40|$|Avoiding <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension</b> and {{conflict}} in South Africa: What {{can we learn}} from Paul’s experience? The dream of a ‘rainbow nation’ in South Africa {{appears to be on}} the wane as <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension</b> {{and conflict}} seem to simmer just beneath the surface. This article investigates Paul’s approach to the issue of ethnic identity with reference to ethnicity and social identity theory. Initially, Paul adopted a radical approach, which basically rendered ethnic identity irrelevant. However, he came to realise that ethnic differences need to be accommodated within the group of Jesus followers. The article applies these insights in calling for strong, moral, visionary and discerning leadership in South Africa...|$|R

On 17 August, tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia, largely fueled by recollections of the Serbs of the genocide to which they had been subjected in the Independent State of Croatia during World War II, and their resultant unwillingness to be minorities in an independent Croatia.|$|E

The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) confiscated the weapons of Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana – TO) to minimize potential resistance. On 17 August 1990, the escalating tensions turned into open revolt by the Croatian Serbs. The revolt took place in the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin and in parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina regions and eastern Croatia. In January 1991, Serbia, supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo, made two unsuccessful attempts to obtain approval from the Yugoslav Presidency to deploy the JNA to disarm Croatian security forces.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension</b> between the Mafwe and the Ovambos, the {{majority}} ethnic group of northern Namibia. This {{has led to}} past conflict, including the 1994 formation of the Caprivi Liberation Front, which pushes for a self-rule of the area.|$|R
50|$|When {{national}} boundaries {{that do not}} match ethnic boundaries are drawn, {{such as in the}} Balkans and Central Asia, <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension,</b> massacres and even genocide, sometimes has occurred historically (see Serbian genocide, Bosnian genocide and 2010 South Kyrgyzstan ethnic clashes).|$|R
50|$|Somali {{immigrants}} {{began to}} arrive in St. Cloud {{at the beginning of}} the 21st century to work in the meatpacking industry, and arrived in larger numbers after about 2010, reaching 10% of the population and sparking a period of <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension.</b>|$|R

The remainder of 1991 saw further deterioration of the situation in the region, resulting in war crimes against Serbs and Croats in the Gospić and Široka Kula massacres. Fighting in the region remained deadlocked, with little to no territorial gains to either side, until a lasting ceasefire was called with the signing of the Sarajevo Agreement of 2 January 1992.|$|E
5|$|After the Croatian Democratic Union won 1990 {{parliamentary}} {{elections in the}} Socialist Republic of Croatia, <b>ethnic</b> <b>tensions</b> between Croats and Serbs within the Republic worsened. The ethnic groups are also divided along religious lines as the Croats are Catholics while the Serbs are Orthodox Christians. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) confiscated the weapons of Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana - TO) forces to minimize resistance. On 17 August, tensions escalated into an open revolt by Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, {{and parts of the}} Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia.

5|$|Croatia held an {{independence}} {{referendum on}} 19 May 1991, following the Croatian parliamentary elections of 1990 {{and the rise}} of <b>ethnic</b> <b>tensions</b> that led to the breakup of Yugoslavia. With 83 percent turnout, voters approved the referendum, with 93 percent in favor of independence. Subsequently, Croatia declared independence and the dissolution of its association with Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991, but it introduced a three-month moratorium on the decision when urged to do so by the European Community and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe through the Brioni Agreement. The war in Croatia escalated during the moratorium, and on 8 October 1991, the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia. In 1992, the countries of the European Economic Community granted Croatia diplomatic recognition and Croatia was admitted to the United Nations.|$|E
5000|$|The Czech population, {{previously}} small, grew substantially {{during the}} interwar period, causing <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension.</b> In 1910, 353 Czechs {{lived in the}} town, but by 1930, this number had increased to over 2,000, concentrated in the [...] "Czech quarter" [...] (Česká čtvrť).|$|R

On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina regions and eastern Croatia. They established a Serbian National Council in July 1990, to coordinate opposition to Croatian President Franjo Tuđman's policy of pursuing independence for Croatia. Milan Babić, a dentist from the southern town of Knin, was elected president. Knin's police chief, Milan Martić, established paramilitary militias. The two men eventually became the political and military leaders of the SAO Krajina, a self-declared state incorporating the Serb-inhabited areas of Croatia.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008 general election, BN was {{returned}} to power {{for the first time}} without its customary 2/3 supermajority in the Dewan Rakyat, meaning it could no longer pass constitutional amendments without the support of opposition parties. The election results were widely seen as reflecting discontent {{about the state of the}} country's economy and increasing <b>ethnic</b> <b>tensions</b> within the country; the three main opposition parties had campaigned on a platform condemning the NEP and the government's response to widening economic disparities. The month after, the Crown Prince of Kelantan Tengku Faris Petra said during an assembly organised by the newly formed Malay Unity Action Front that since the Malays had given in to granting the non-Malays citizenship, the latter should not seek equality or special treatment. In his speech, the prince also called for Malay unity to ensure that Malay sovereignty and supremacy was preserved.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1970s, Yugoslavia's Communist regime became {{severely}} splintered into a liberal-decentralist nationalist faction led by Croatia and Slovenia {{that supported}} a decentralized federation to give greater autonomy to Croatia and Slovenia, versus a conservative-centralist nationalist faction led by Serbia that supported a centralized federation to secure Serbia's and Serbs' interests across Yugoslavia – {{as they were}} the largest ethnic group in {{the country as a}} whole. From 1967 to 1972 in Croatia and 1968 and 1981 protests in Kosovo, nationalist doctrines and actions caused <b>ethnic</b> <b>tensions</b> that destabilized Yugoslavia. The suppression by the state of nationalists is believed to have had the effect of identifying nationalism as the primary alternative to communism itself and made it a strong underground movement.|$|E
50|$|The Juba Post was {{for several}} years the only {{newspaper}} based in Juba, the capital of South Sudan. Over the years, a number of its editors and managers have been arrested by authorities after publishing articles concerning <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension,</b> lack of {{rule of law and}} corruption.|$|R

5|$|A poll {{following}} the 2008 summit showed that 82.5 percent of citizens surveyed opposed changing the constitutional name {{in order to}} join NATO. Elections were called {{following the}} 2008 summit, resulting in further support for the centre-right pro-NATO party, VMRO-DPMNE. The elections were marred by violence that was criticized by NATO members. <b>Ethnic</b> <b>tensions</b> have persisted in Macedonia, and NATO has called for dialogue following clashes {{such as those in}} the city of Kumanovo in 2015, which were blamed in part on the delay in NATO and European integration. NATO membership in general is supported by 81 percent according to a November 2014 poll. On 12 June 2017, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev signaled that he will consider alternatives names for the country in order to strike a compromise with Greece, settle the naming dispute, and lift Greek objections to Macedonia joining the alliance. Zaev also floated the idea of Macedonia joining the alliance under the provisional name it uses at the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|From 1848 {{to the end}} of the 19th century, local Polish and Czech people co-operated, united {{against the}} Germanizing tendencies of the Austrian Empire and later of Austria-Hungary. At the end of the century, <b>ethnic</b> <b>tensions</b> arose as the area's {{economic}} significance grew. This growth caused a wave of immigration from Galicia. About 60,000 people arrived between 1880 and 1910. The new immigrants were Polish and poor, about half of them being illiterate. They worked in coal mining and metallurgy. For these people the most important factor was material well-being; they cared little about the homeland from which they had fled. Almost all of them assimilated into the Czech population. Many of them settled in Ostrava (west of the ethnic border), as heavy industry was spread through the whole western part of Cieszyn Silesia. Even today, ethnographers find that about 25,000 people in Ostrava (about 8% of the population) have Polish surnames.|$|E
5|$|From {{the second}} half of the 18th century onwards, the Ottoman Empire began to decline. The Tanzimat reforms of the 19th century, which had been instituted by Mahmud II, were aimed to modernise the Ottoman state in line with the {{progress}} that had been made in Western Europe. The efforts of Midhat Pasha during the late Tanzimat era led the Ottoman constitutional movement of 1876, which introduced the First Constitutional Era, but these efforts proved to be inadequate in most fields, and failed to stop the dissolution of the empire. As the empire gradually shrank in size, military power and wealth, especially after the Ottoman economic crisis and default in 1875 which led to uprisings in the Balkan provinces that culminated into the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, many Balkan Muslims migrated to the Empire's heartland in Anatolia, along with the Circassians fleeing the Russian conquest of the Caucasus. The decline of the Ottoman Empire led to a rise in nationalist sentiment among its various subject peoples, leading to increased <b>ethnic</b> <b>tensions</b> which occasionally burst into violence, such as the Hamidian massacres of Armenians.|$|E
50|$|The High Commissioner on National Minorities {{was created}} on July 8, 1992 by the Helsinki Summit Meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. It {{is charged with}} {{identifying}} and seeking early resolution of <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension</b> that might endanger peace, stability or friendly relations between participating states.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, Samuel K. Doe's {{government}} increasingly {{adopted an}} ethnic outlook {{as members of}} his Krahn ethnic group soon dominated political and military life in Liberia. This caused a heightened level of <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension</b> leading to frequent hostilities between the politically and militarily dominant Krahns and other {{ethnic groups in the}} country.|$|R
25|$|In theory, {{this leads}} to self {{governance}} and protection for the ethnic group. Many scholars maintain that since <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension</b> erupts into <b>ethnic</b> violence when the ethnic group is threatened by a state, then veto powers should allow the ethnic group to avoid legislative threats. Switzerland is often characterized as a successful consociationalist state.|$|R
