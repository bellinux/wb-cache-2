However, following the resignation of Watkin in 1894, relations between the two companies gradually improved under his successors Sir George Russell (1895) and, most notably, under Cosmo Bonsor (1897). Bonsor managed to persuade the two boards of governors to see sense and from 1 January 1899 the South Eastern and Chatham Railways Joint Management Committee was formed to oversee joint working, with Bonsor as its chairman. On 5 August 1899 the South Eastern and London, Chatham and Dover Railway Companies Act was passed, which resulted {{in the formation of the}} South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SE&CR).

Simulations based on these characteristics confirm that the proposed methods achieve superior computation load reduction on the transcoding service proxy. 1...|$|R

Using German SOEP 2002 data, I analyze the effect of insurance status on the insured's number of doctor visits. Conditional on health, privately insured patients are less likely to contact a physician than publicly insured but more frequently visit a doctor following a first contact. This is indirect evidence for the hypothesis that physicians over-treat privately insured patients at least relative to the statutorily insured. ...|$|E

Customers of two classes (high and low priority) arrive into the system. A server has a service capacity of multiple <b>identical</b> <b>service</b> units. Each high-priority customer requires a single service unit. The system works under the preemptive discipline, i.e. an admitted high-priority customer immediately gets service upon his arrival either by getting an idle service unit or by occupying service unit being used by low-priority customers. High-priority customers are served according to the first in first out (FIFO) and low-priority customers are served according to the processor sharing (PS) principle. Furthermore, the service capacity for low-priority customers depends on the number of high-priority customers in the system.|$|R
