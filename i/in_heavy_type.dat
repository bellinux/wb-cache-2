Later he would dedicate some of his works to them, and also to Eva Sikelianos. Gradually he established himself in literary circles and become recognised as a first-rate prose writer of the younger generation. Many in fact saw him as the leading one. A number of contemporary periodicals sought contributions from him. Some of his short stories made great impressions: [...] "O Skelethras" [...] (The Skeleton), [...] "To mystiko" [...] (The Secret), [...] "I koukla" [...] (The doll), [...] "Oi Iperetes" [...] (The Servants), and [...] "Metathanato" [...] (After death).

5000|$|Freud {{had been}} {{treating}} a patient, whom he called Irma, {{during the summer}} of 1895. At one point he proposed a particular treatment solution that Irma was not willing to accept. Irma’s treatment was partially successful, but it ended before it was complete. After some time had passed, Freud visited with a colleague who knew Irma and asked about her condition. Freud was informed that Irma was “better, but not quite well.” [...] That night, Freud dreamt the dream that is now known as [...] "Irma’s Injection". He described it as follows: A large hall - numerous guests, whom we were receiving. - Among them was Irma. I at once took her to one side, as though to answer her letter and to reproach her for not having accepted my 'solution' yet. I said to her: 'If you still get pains, it's really only your fault.' She replies: 'If you only knew what pains I've got now in my throat and stomach and abdomen - it's choking me.' - I was alarmed and looked at her. She looked pale and puffy. I thought to myself that after all I must be missing some organic trouble. I took her to the window and looked down her throat, and she showed signs of recalcitrance, like women with artificial dentures. I thought to myself that there was really no need for her to do that. She then opened her mouth properly and on the right I found a big white patch; at another place I saw extensive whitish grey scabs upon some remarkable curly structures which were evidently modelled on the turbinal bones of the nose. - I at once called in Dr M, and he repeated the examination and confirmed it ... Dr M looked quite different from usual; he was very pale, he walked with a limp and his chin was clean-shaven ... My friend Otto was now standing beside her as well, and my friend Leopold was percussing her through her bodice and saying: 'She has a dull area low down on the left.' He also indicated that a portion of the skin on her left shoulder was infiltrated. (I noticed this, just as he did, in spite of her dress.) ... M said: 'There's no doubt it's an infection, but no matter; dysentery will supervene and the toxin will be eliminated. ... We were directly aware, too, of the origin of the infection. Not long before, when she was feeling unwell, my friend Otto had given her an injection of a preparation of propyl, propyls ... propionic acid ... trimethylamin (and I saw before me the formula for this printed <b>in</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>type)</b> ... Injections of this sort ought not to be given so thoughtlessly ... And probably the syringe had not been clean.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel robust approach to enable efficient searching of the type-written text on museum archive cards. Depending on {{such factors as}} {{the state of the}} typewriter and its ribbon, these text images may be faint with parts of the character missing, or be <b>in</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>type</b> with adjacent characters merging together. Both these problems can make this kind of text hard to read with conventional OCR methods that rely on the use of a limited number of segmentation hypotheses prior to recognition. Our method involves sliding a classifier over the entire word or card image, such that we get a set of recognition hypotheses for each possible window position which gives rise to a large character hypothesis graph. We then apply a graph reduction followed by an efficient graph search method to search for words in the reduced graph. Results so far are promising, with our system achieving 45 % word recognition accuracy compared to the 25 % achieved by a leading commercial package. However, searching the original larger graphs is much slower but yields 85 % accuracy, so further work is needed either in improving the graph reduction method, or in improving the efficiency with which we can search the larger graph.

40|$|Abstract: Diet and {{physical}} activity are principal determinants of nutritional status and energy balance. Low physical activity {{has been shown to}} be one of the risk factors for development of obesity in children. One's physical activity as a child is a predictor of physical activity level as an adult. This study was aimed at describing the type, frequency and duration of physical activity and their association to BMI-for-age status of school-age children in Tamale. In this cross-sectional study, a sample of 400 school-age children was selected from randomly selected schools in Tamale, Ghana. The physical activity questionnaire for children (PAQ-C) was used to assess physical activity levels. Anthropometric measurements of age, weight and height were measured and computed to determine the adiposity status of the children. More than 80 % of the studied children engaged in moderate to heavy type of physical activity. By frequency, 88. 3 % of boys and 75 % of girls participated in a physical activity at least 2 times a week. During leisure times, more boys than girls played football and more girls than boys watched television. A significant proportion of the children engaged <b>in</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>type</b> of physical activity with increase in age. An overweight/obesity prevalence of 8. 5 % was found.

See chart. At the former locality 1000 young (3 - 5 years) fish were liberated 24. june to 1. july, at the last named place 1119 big fish (5 - 10 years old). The sizes are given in fig. 2. The percentages of recapture up till now (Oct. 1925) are 6. 10 for the small and 7. 03 for the big fish. The extent of the migrations undertaken by the marked fish may be seen from the chart. Especially interesting are the two recaptures in southern Norway during the following spring, clearly demonstrating the wide-roaming nature of the saithe. It is, on the other hand, very remarkable how many fish have stayed for many months {{in the vicinity of the}} place where they were set free. Particulars concerning the recaptures in point of time and distance travelled are found in the tables pag. 11, 12 and 13, where each fish exclusive of those which have travelled less than 20 kilometres, are denoted by a figure indicating its size, in italics if the migration has been to the northward, <b>in</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>type</b> if it has travelled southwards, the distance being denoted by the column wherein it is placed.

40|$|Bartlett (1936) {{showed that}} if r is a Poisson {{variable}} with mean m and y is a random variable whose values y are derived by the transformation y = V ' (l! l) from the values r of r, then y is distributed rather more nearly normally than r with variance approximately if m is large, and {{the technique of}} analysis of variance may be'applied to y. * He also showed that V = J(r + i) (1 * 2) is a better transformation, if slightly less convenient to use, as y then has more nearly a constant variance of J, even when m is not large. Similar transformations were proposed for a binomial variable, and Beall (1942) gave the transformation analogous to (1 - 1) appro-priate to a negative binomial variable. I begin by considering the transformation y = V(r + c) (1 - 3) of a Poisson variable r, and show that for large m y has a most nearly constant variance (namely, J) when c = f; a result due to A. H. L. Johnson. The similar transformation for a binomial variable r, with mean TO and total number n, is The optimum value of c is £ if TO and n — TO are large. The variance is approximately J(n + £) - 1. For a negative binomial variable r, with mean TO and exponent k, the latter being constant and known, the corresponding transformation is The optimum value of c is roughly § if TO is large and k> 2, and the variance is approximately 'k), where i/r'(t) denotes the second derivative of lnr( 1, is y = ln(r + £fc); (1 - 6) the variance is approximately ifr'(k). This is equivalent to setting c = įn (1 * 5). If A; is large, i/r'(k) = l/(fc —-J) approximately. The effect of these transformations for small values of m is shown numerically. The value § for c appears to be nearly optimum for practical purposes, except with the negative bi-nomial distribution when k is small. (When k = 2, the optimum value of c appears to be about 0 - 2.) In any case, {{it may be more}} convenient to choose a one-decimal value for c, i. e. generally 0 - 3 or 0 - 4. * Letters <b>in</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>type</b> denote random variables, of which the same letter in light type denotes a possible value.

This type of cab is especially suited to the delivery conditions in Europe where many roads follow the layout of much more ancient path and trackways which require the additional turning capability of the cab over engine type.

The wide use of wire-reinforced rubber products such as conveyor belts, hose and radial ply tyres has reawakened interest in the parameters affecting the adhesion of rubber to brass plated steel wire. My research work {{is an attempt to}} improve and explain the rubber to metal bonding technology; it is concerned with the effect of rubber compounding ingredients as well as wire surface factors on adhesion. This work pertains to show the role played by two of the recently introduced and widely used bonding systems namely (i) Hexamethylene tetramine-resorcinol system and (ii) the Triazine system (Vulcabond SW) * on the adhesion of the rubber to brass plated steel wire. Different carbon blacks, as well as different accelerators and silica are shown to have a great influence on the amount of rubber adhesion to brass plated steel wire. The state of the wire plating as well as the contamination of its surface affects bonding and these parameters were studied using the scanning electron microscope. XPS techniques are employed to explain the role of some accelerators in the mechanism of bonding rubber to brass plated steel wire. A relationship has been found to exist between bind strength and rubber fracture properties. Because of the widespread use of radial tyres in the automobile industry and in every field <b>in</b> which <b>heavy</b> <b>types</b> of tyres are used, this research considers in detail the phenomena of fatigue and pressure at various temperatures on bond life.

5000|$|There is, therefore, {{some doubt}} as to what exactly cataphracts were in late antiquity, {{and whether or not}} they were {{distinct}} from clibanarii. Some historians theorise that cataphracts and clibanarii were one and the same type of cavalry, designated differently simply as a result of their divided geographical locations and local linguistic preferences. Cataphract-like cavalry under the command of the Western Roman Empire, where Latin was the official tongue, always bore the Latinized variant of the original Greek name, Cataphractarii. The cataphract-like cavalry stationed in the Eastern Roman Empire had no exclusive term ascribed to them, with both the Latin variant and the Greek innovation Clibanarii being used in historical sources, largely because of the Byzantine's heavy Greek influence (especially after the 7th century, when Latin ceased to be the official language). Contemporary sources, however, sometimes imply that clibanarii were <b>in</b> fact a <b>heavier</b> <b>type</b> of cavalryman, or formed special-purpose units (such as the late Equites Sagittarii Clibanarii, a Roman equivalent of horse archers, first mentioned in the Notitia Dignitatum). Therefore, either side can be argued, but given the fact that [...] "cataphract" [...] was used for more than a millennium by various cultures, it stands to reason that different types of fully armored cavalry in the armies of different nations were assigned this name by Greek and Roman scholars not familiar with the native terms for such cavalry.|$|R
