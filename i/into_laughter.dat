5|$|Up to this point, Australia's {{performances}} {{had been}} poor, and winter athletes were often derided by the summer-dominated administrators. During one meeting, a cross-country representative {{asked for the}} selection of six athletes, prompting the selection committee chairman to interject. The chairman said that a seventh place would be needed, {{and went on to}} explain that a dog was required to find the athletes after they got lost in the snow. The majority of his colleagues burst <b>into</b> <b>laughter.</b>|$|E
25|$|At first, {{the editor}} of the Lancet was not named in the journal, but after a few weeks, rumours began to circulate. After the journal began {{printing}} the content of Sir Astley Cooper's lectures without permission, the great man paid a surprise visit to his former pupil to discover Wakley correcting the proofs of the next issue. Upon recognising each other, they fell immediately <b>into</b> <b>laughter</b> or perhaps an altercation. Either way, they reached an agreement that was mutually satisfactory.|$|E

25|$|In Part II, Evgenii finds a ferryman and {{commands}} him to row {{to where}} Parasha's home {{used to be}} (ll. 26 – ll. 56). However, he discovers that her home has been destroyed (ll. 57–60), and falls into a crazed delirium and breaks <b>into</b> <b>laughter</b> (ll. 61–65). For a year, he roams the street as a madman (ll. 89–130), but the following autumn, he is reminded of {{the night of the}} storm (ll. 132–133) and the source of his troubles. In a fit of rage, he curses the statue of Peter (ll. 177–179), which brings the statue to life, and Peter begins pursuing Evgenii (ll. 180–196). The narrator does not describe Evgenii's death directly, but the poem closes with the discovery of his corpse in a ruined hut floating on the water (ll. 219–222).|$|E
25|$|Many of Kitano's {{routines}} involved him portraying {{a gangster}} or other harsh characters. Kitano {{said that after}} playing comedy clubs he would be invited to drink with yakuza, where he would learn stories about the big crime bosses. His first major film role in Nagisa Oshima's Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (where he starred opposite Tom Conti, Ryuichi Sakamoto and David Bowie), featured him cast as a tough POW camp sergeant during World War II. Kitano {{said that he was}} happy with his performance and snuck into a showing of the film to see how the audience would accept him as a serious actor instead of a comedian. He was devastated when the audience burst <b>into</b> <b>laughter</b> upon his appearing on screen, but vowed to stick to serious and dark characters in film.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to ? was favourable. Indah Setiawati of The Jakarta Post {{wrote that the}} film was a [...] "gallant attempt to promoted [...] moderate Islam and reveal the sensitive issues {{in the country in}} a casual way", and that viewers should [...] "get ready to burst <b>into</b> <b>laughter</b> and break down in tears". Aguslia, writing for Tempo, said that it was better than the 2010 Citra Award winner 3 Hati Dua Dunia, Satu Cinta, which had similar themes. Kartoyo DS, reviewing for Suara Karya after a press screening, praised the plot, visuals, and music.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} the first {{original}} episode of The Office to be broadcast since the episode [...] "The Deposition" [...] on November 15, 2007, due {{to the effects of}} the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. As such, the atmosphere on the set was one of a more laid-back nature, and the cast broke <b>into</b> <b>laughter</b> due to the jokes many times. [...] "Dinner Party" [...] received largely positive reviews from critics, with many hailing it as one of the series' best entries. The episode received 4.8 Nielsen rating and was watched by 9.2 million viewers.|$|E
500|$|The split-second {{incident}} {{only allowed}} Banks {{time for one}} conscious thought – that the shot was impossible to catch, {{and the only way}} to prevent Pelé from following up on the rebound would be to parry the ball over the bar. The ball bounced two yards in front of the goal-line, and Banks managed to make contact with the ball with the fingers of his right hand, and rolled his hand slightly to angle to ball over the crossbar. He landed in the inner netting of the goal, and knew he had saved the ball after witnessing Pelé's reaction. Banks then rose to his feet to defend the corner, and broke <b>into</b> <b>laughter</b> after the following exchange: ...|$|E
500|$|Diane Selwyn {{wakes up}} in her bed in the same {{apartment}} that Betty and Rita investigated. She looks exactly like Betty, but is a failed actress driven into a deep depression by her failed affair with Camilla Rhodes, a successful actress who looks exactly like Rita. At Camilla's invitation, Diane attends a party at Adam's house on Mulholland Drive. At dinner, Diane states she came to Hollywood when her Aunt Ruth died and left her some money, and she met Camilla at an audition for The Sylvia North Story. Another woman who looks like the [...] "Camilla Rhodes" [...] from earlier kisses Camilla, and they turn and smile at Diane. Adam and Camilla prepare to make an important announcement, but they dissolve <b>into</b> <b>laughter</b> and kiss while Diane watches, crying. Later, Diane meets the hit man at Winkie's, hiring him to kill Camilla. He tells her she'll find a blue key in her apartment when the job is completed.|$|E

500|$|Emanuel {{is known}} for his [...] "take-no-prisoners style" [...] that has earned him the {{nickname}} [...] "Rahmbo." [...] Emanuel sent a dead fish in a box to a pollster who was late delivering polling results. On the night after the 1992 election, angry at Democrats and Republicans who [...] "betrayed" [...] them in the 1992 election, Emanuel stood up at a celebratory dinner with colleagues from the campaign and began plunging a steak knife into the table and began rattling off names while shouting [...] "Dead! Dead! Dead!". Before Tony Blair gave a pro-Clinton speech during the impeachment crisis, Emanuel reportedly screamed at Blair [...] "Don't fuck this up!" [...] while Clinton was present. Blair and Clinton both burst <b>into</b> <b>laughter.</b> However, by 2007 friends of Emanuel were saying that he has [...] "mellowed out". Stories of his personal style have entered the popular culture, inspiring articles and websites that chronicle these and other quotes and incidents. The character Josh Lyman in The West Wing was said to be based on Emanuel, though executive producer Lawrence O'Donnell denied this.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} {{all that he}} wished in the Peloponnesus, Epaminondas had persuaded his fellow Boeotarchs {{to remain in the}} field for several months after their term of office had expired. Upon his return home, Epaminondas was therefore greeted not with a hero's welcome but with a trial arranged by his political enemies. According to Cornelius Nepos, in his defense Epaminondas merely requested that, if he be executed, the inscription regarding the verdict read: [...] Epaminondas was punished by the Thebans with death, because he obliged them to overthrow the Lacedaemonians at Leuctra, whom, before he was general, none of the Boeotians durst look upon in the field, and because he not only, by one battle, rescued Thebes from destruction, but also secured liberty for all Greece, and brought the power of both people to such a condition, that the Thebans attacked Sparta, and the Lacedaemonians were content if they could save their lives; nor did he cease to prosecute the war, till, after settling Messene, he shut up Sparta with a close siege. The jury broke <b>into</b> <b>laughter,</b> the charges were dropped, and Epaminondas was re-elected as Boeotarch for the next year.|$|E
500|$|Sir Archibald Bodkin, the Director of Public Prosecutions, set out {{the case}} for the prosecution. The {{evidence}} was overwhelming; the prosecution case highlighted the contents of Lody's notebook and the luggage that he had left at the Roxburgh Hotel, and called a series of witnesses, including the elderly Scottish woman who ran the boarding-house in which he had stayed in Edinburgh and the fashionably dressed Ida McClyment, who caused a stir when she described her meeting with Lody aboard the London to Edinburgh train. Bodkin did not read the incriminating letters aloud, due to the sensitivity of their content, but described them in general terms. The witnesses testified about their interactions with Lody and identified him as the man who had posed as [...] "Charles A. Inglis", though the proprietress of the Edinburgh boarding-house experienced some difficulty. When she [...] "was asked if she could see 'Charles A. Inglis' in court, [...] looked everywhere except at the dock. Lody, who was sitting, stood up and gently waved his hands to attract her attention, while he smiled broadly and almost broke <b>into</b> <b>laughter</b> at the absurdity of the situation." ...|$|E

500|$|The defence's {{witnesses}} {{included some}} of those who had cared for Elizabeth Parsons and who presumably still believed that the ghost was real. [...] Other witnesses included the carpenter responsible for removing the wainscotting from Parsons' apartment and Catherine Friend, who to escape the knocking noises had left the property. [...] One witness's testimony caused the court to burst <b>into</b> <b>laughter,</b> at which she replied [...] "I assure you gentlemen, it is no laughing matter, whatever you may think of it." [...] Thomas Broughton was also called, as was a priest surnamed Ross, one of those who had questioned the ghost. [...] Judge Murray asked him [...] "Whether he thought he had puzzled the Ghost, or the Ghost had puzzled him?" [...] John Moore was offered support by several esteemed gentlemen and presented Murray with a letter from Thomas Secker, Archbishop of Canterbury, who sought to intercede on his behalf. [...] Murray placed the letter in his pocket, unopened, and told the court [...] "it was impossible it could relate to the cause in question." [...] Richard James and Richard Parsons also received support from various witnesses, some of whom although acknowledging Parsons' drink problem, told the court they could not believe he was guilty.|$|E
500|$|When {{the parks}} {{department}} casts {{votes for the}} best mural, they each vote for their own artwork. As a compromise, Leslie creates a mural using pieces of everybody's artwork, but {{the result is an}} ugly and confusing mess. Leslie enlists the help of Mark (Paul Schneider), who draws a bland but skillful sketch of an old man feeding pigeons in the park. Mark himself admits the sketch is dull, but claims it will win because it has mass appeal. Nobody in the parks department likes it except [...] Ron (Nick Offerman), but Leslie insists on entering it so they will win, much to everybody's disappointment. While waiting to present the sketch, Leslie sees how much fun other departments had in making their mural, and she decides to enter the parks department's original mural after all. The town council committee are confused by the proposal, but the parks department have fun presenting it and break <b>into</b> <b>laughter.</b> In the end, the town decides not to spend any money on a new mural and simply renames the old one [...] "The Diversity Express". The parks department is nevertheless proud of their work, which they hang in their conference room; Ron also hangs Mark's sketch in his office.|$|E
500|$|... "The Pony Remark" [...] {{featured}} the second appearance of Helen and Morty Seinfeld, {{who had previously}} appeared in the season 1 episode [...] "The Stake Out". In [...] "The Stake Out", Morty was portrayed by Phil Bruns; however, David and Seinfeld decided they wanted the character to be harsher, and re-cast him with Barney Martin, who auditioned for the part on October 15, 1990 at 12.45 PM. Martin was unaware that another actor had already established the part. Helen was portrayed by Liz Sheridan; in an early draft of the episode, her name was Adele, though this did not match her name from [...] "The Stake Out". It was later changed back to Helen. The episode also introduced Jerry's uncle Leo, portrayed by Len Lesser, who {{was known for his}} acting in gangster films, and also The Outlaw Josey Wales and Kelly's Heroes. When Lesser auditioned for the part on October 22, 1990, he got a lot of laughs from David, Seinfeld and casting director Marc Herschfield, but did not understand why, because he did not think his lines were funny. Herschfield stated that Lesser was the right actor for the part when Lesser had auditioned. David Fresco guest starred in the episode as Isaac. Fresco had some difficulty with his lines in the episode, and would sometimes burst <b>into</b> <b>laughter</b> during filming. Other actors who guest-starred in the episode were Rozsika Halmos, who portrayed Manya, and Milt Oberman, who played the funeral director.|$|E

500|$|Homer {{attempts}} to appease Grimes by inviting {{him to his}} home for a lobster dinner {{in order to make}} him and his enemy co-worker friends. Grimes' visit to the Simpson house only fuels his resentment; he is incensed by Homer's ability to live such a comfortable life and earn so many accomplishments (such as being friends with former president Gerald Ford, going on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins, going into space, and winning a Grammy) despite his slothful and ignorant ways, while Grimes has to live a life of hard work and all he has to show for it is a battered briefcase, a bad haircut, and a single room apartment between two bowling alleys. Declaring Homer a [...] "fraud", a bitter Grimes storms away in anger. The following day, Homer, after getting advice from Marge, makes further {{attempts to}} earn Grimes' respect by acting as a model employee, but his efforts fail. Grimes rants about Homer to Lenny and Carl, both of whom insist that despite his faults, Homer is essentially a decent person. To prove Homer's lack of intelligence, he tricks Homer into entering a nuclear power plant design contest intended for children, by carefully cutting away all references to them in a promotional poster which he leaves at Homer's control panel. Homer, unaware that the contest is only open to kids, eagerly takes on the challenge to prove his professionalism. At the contest, Grimes is horrified when Homer's model, which is almost exactly the same as the current power plant with only a few modifications, easily wins against Ralph Wiggum's Malibu Stacy dream house, and Martin Prince's futuristic model that supplies power to the room. The audience's applause and cheers for Homer cause Grimes to finally snap and he runs amok through the plant, mimicking and mocking Homer's habits. Entering Homer's office, Grimes sees a machine labeled [...] "Extremely High Voltage", sarcastically declares that he does not need safety gloves because he's Homer Simpson, grabs the high voltage wires and is fatally electrocuted. At Grimes' funeral (with a headstone that simply reads [...] "Grimes"), Homer unintentionally and unknowingly gets the last laugh as he falls asleep and in a drowsy state tells Marge to change the TV channel, causing all the attendees to burst <b>into</b> <b>laughter</b> and completely ignore Grimes' coffin as it's lowered into the earth.|$|E
2500|$|Heisenberg's {{view was}} tolerant. Pauli, raised as a Catholic, had kept silent after some initial remarks, but when finally {{he was asked}} for his opinion, said: [...] "Well, our friend Dirac has got a {{religion}} and its guiding principle is 'There is no God and Paul Dirac is His prophet.'" [...] Everybody, including Dirac, burst <b>into</b> <b>laughter.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Minnesota {{marching band}} {{performed}} first, followed by UW band, when the card stunts began.

The NBC national television broadcast was trained on the band and card stunts. The 14th card stunt design displayed [...] "CALTECH" [...] instead of [...] "HUSKIES" [...] in big block letters on a white background. The announcers and the stadium fell silent for several moments before breaking <b>into</b> <b>laughter.</b>|$|E
