5|$|The {{works of}} {{painters}} Ernest Stafford Carlos, Norman Rockwell, Pierre Joubert and Joseph Csatari and the 1966 film Follow Me, Boys! are prime {{examples of this}} ethos. Scouting is often dealt with in a humorous manner, as in the 1989 film Troop Beverly Hills, the 2005 film Down and Derby, and the film Scout Camp. In 1980, Scottish singer and songwriter Gerry Rafferty recorded <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Boy</b> Scout {{as part of his}} Snakes and Ladders album.|$|E

The more well-to-do had this kind. The tepee type was just made of brush. It had a place for {{a fire in the}} center. It was just thrown together. Both types were common even before my time....|$|E

He later commented on his promotions, [...] "Everybody thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> wonder. I {{was just in the}} right place at the right time." [...] As a chief, Finn served with patrol squadrons in San Diego, Washington, and Panama.|$|E

500|$|Phillip Leslie Wilcher {{was born}} on 16 March 1958 to Naomi Joy Thompson (8 April 1929 – 21 June 2005) and Leslie James Wilcher (born 16 January 1923), a World War II veteran. Wilcher grew up in Camperdown. As of 2004, he resided in Concord and owns no cell phone, watch, computer, or car: [...] "My entire life since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> was writing music and that has overshadowed everything. [...] I would be happy living in an {{oversized}} cardboard box with a piano and a blank sheet of manuscript paper".|$|E
500|$|One former islander, James Simpson, {{recalls that}} [...] "we had {{about two hundred}} and fifty folks here when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy.</b> It never seemed a lonely place. There were always people {{going in and out of}} each other's houses, there were forty {{children}} at the school and there were two teachers. We had concerts; three concerts in the winter when you had to sing loud to get above the sound of the wind. The young people would meet at the shop in the long, long evenings in summer." [...] The island had some distinctively eccentric characters: Donald Banks, the island's coffin-maker, was known for quarrelling with his neighbours (telling one family, [...] "I'll no bury any more o' ye!") and combining poetry with coffin-making, as in the order he placed with a mainland supplier: ...|$|E

"I...recall {{seeing an}} {{airplane}} flight {{made by the}} late Gustave Whitehead approximately thirty-five years ago. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> at the time, playing on a lot near the Whitehead shop on Cherry Street, and recall the incident well as we were {{surprised to see the}} plane leave the ground. It traveled a distance of approximately three hundred feet, and at a height of approximately fifteen feet in the air, {{to the best of my}} recollection." ...|$|E

2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of his solo career in 1973, Eno was in demand as a producer– though his management now describe him as a [...] "sonic landscaper" [...] rather than a producer. The first album with Eno credited as producer was Lucky Leif and the Longships by Robert Calvert. Eno's lengthy string of producer credits includes albums for Talking Heads, U2, Devo, Ultravox and James. He also produced part of the 1993 album When <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Boy</b> by Jane Siberry. He won the best producer award at the 1994 and 1996 BRIT Awards.|$|E
2500|$|The {{play has}} also been {{analysed}} {{as part of the}} theatre of the absurd. In a 1984 article, Archie J. Loss argues that nothing can ever happen in the relationship of Elyot and Amanda, because it is based on conflicting emotions: [...] "they are bound to repeat themselves, playing out their scene again and again with different words and different props but always with the same result." [...] In [...] a 2000 study of Coward, Jean Chothia instances surreal exchanges in the play, such as: [...] "Have you ever crossed the Sahara on a camel?" [...] "Frequently. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> we used to do it all the time. My Grandmother had a wonderful seat on a camel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Allergies and asthma, {{from which}} he had already suffered, began to present {{themselves}} in more forceful episodes. In addition to the symptoms, these brought on a feeling of exclusion and peril: [...] "I think it {{may have had a}} negative influence on my childhood and adolescence, this particular aberrant idea which gradually took root in me: the impossibility of actively participating in the game of life, insofar as I would soon be excluded. I suffered from various types of allergies, and at that time, the diagnosis could be rather confused and doubtful. Asthma and hay fever, which had tormented me since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy,</b> were sometimes interpreted as a condition that could seriously worsen, even in the short term" [...] (from the [...] "Self-Portrait").|$|E

His best-known work is the novel Sikur të isha djalë (If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>Boy).</b>|$|R

2500|$|Swanton himself {{clarified}} {{the nature}} of Altham's contribution to A History of Cricket. [...] "In the obituary written in the factual, anonymous vein generally adopted by Wisden," [...] he wrote, [...] "I notice {{for the first time}} what {{can only be described as}} a howler. The second paragraph of the piece begins: 'Altham collaborated with E. W. Swanton in a book, The History of Cricket...' ... The first edition of A History of Cricket (note the indefinite article) was written by Harry when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy.</b> It was twelve years later, in 1938, that he honoured me by asking me to collaborate with him, in a Second Edition. This I did, and so continued with three subsequent editions, as the junior and subservient partner, until the last appeared in two volumes some three years before his death." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{believed}} {{that although he}} played right-handed as an adult, Hogan was actually left-handed. In his book [...] "Five Lessons," [...] in the chapter entitled [...] "The Grip," [...] Hogan said [...] "I was born left-handed -- that was the normal {{way for me to}} do things. I was switched over to doing things right-handed when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>boy</b> but I started golf as a left-hander because the first club I ever came into possession of, an old five-iron, was a left-handed stick." [...] This belief also seemed to be corroborated by Hogan himself in his earlier book [...] "Power Golf." [...] However, some mystery still remains about this since Hogan in subsequent interviews said that the belief of him being left-handed was actually a myth (noted in what was probably his last video interview and in his 1987 Golf Magazine interview).|$|E
