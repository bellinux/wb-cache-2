5000|$|Home range {{requirements}} for the Newfoundland Marten are extremely large due to the larger body size. Males hold larger home-ranges (29.54 km2) than females (15.19 km2) which are significantly larger than other species of martens across most of the geographic range. These larger home-ranges reflect the larger body sizes and the lower diversity and abundance of prey. Martens will also adjust their behavior and home-ranges to suit the habitat needs since the average home-range of the marten is typically larger than the average defoliate parch size and therefore will need to adjust for defoliation disturbance. Newfoundland martens are also intrasexually territorial and show home-range fidelity. <b>Home-range</b> <b>size</b> have variation between years for both sexes based on {{the changes in the}} food abundance as well as the individual's ability to obtain their prey. Within the year, martens may modify their movements during the winter because it is an additional energetic constraint that they have to respond to the harsher weather conditions and lower resource availability.|$|E
40|$|Data on 22 radio-collared adult female {{roe deer}} Capreolus capreolus in the Chize ́ forest {{were used to}} test whether their <b>home-range</b> <b>size</b> was {{influenced}} by resource availability and reproductive status. As roe deer females are income breeders and invest heavily in each reproductive attempt, they should be limited by energetic constraints. Thus it was expected that: (1) heavier females should have larger home ranges; (2) that <b>home-range</b> <b>size</b> should decrease with increasing vegetation biomass; (3) <b>home-range</b> <b>size</b> should increase with increasing reproductive effort (i. e. females with two fawns at heel should have larger home ranges than those with one fawn, which should have larger home range than females without fawns). To test these predictions, variation in spring–summer <b>home-range</b> <b>size</b> was studied in 2001 and 2002, using 95 % kernel home-range estimation.

For grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), recent decline of whitebark pine (WBP; Pinus albicaulis), an important fall food resource, has been paired with a slowing of population growth following two decades of robust population increase. These observations have raised questions whether resource decline or density-dependent processes may be associated with changes in population growth. Distinguishing these effects based on changes in demographic rates can be difficult. However, unlike the parallel demographic responses expected from both decreasing food availability and increasing population density, we hypothesized opposing behavioral responses of grizzly bears with regard to changes in <b>home-range</b> <b>size.</b> We used the dynamic changes in food resources and population density of grizzly bears as a natural experiment to examine hypotheses regarding these potentially competing influences on grizzly bear <b>home-range</b> <b>size.</b> We found that <b>home-range</b> <b>size</b> did not increase during the period of whitebark pine decline and was not related to proportion of whitebark pine in home ranges.

These allometries were investigated {{in relation to}} a carnivorous, omnivorous or herbivorous diet and, in the case of birds, also territoriality. Initially, non-phylogenetic comparative analyses were undertaken by fitting general linear models to data on average <b>home-range</b> <b>size</b> and average body mass obtained from the literature. Then, two phylogenetic trees for the studied species of mammals and birds were reconstructed and phylogenetic independent contrasts were applied {{in order to determine the}} influence of phylogeny on these relationships. For mammals, the type of diet proved to be a determining factor in defining the relationship between <b>home-range</b> <b>size</b> and body mass. Significant allometries were found with both conventional and phylogenetic analyses in all trophic groups.

However, {{little is known about the}} relationships between Spotted Owl survival and <b>home-range</b> <b>size</b> and the characteristics of fire-prone, mixed-conifer forests of the Klamath province. Thus, the objectives of this study were to estimate monthly survival rates and <b>home-range</b> <b>size</b> in relation to habitat characteristics for Northern Spotted Owls in southwestern Oregon. <b>Home-range</b> <b>size</b> and survival of 15 Northern Spotted Owls was monitored using radiotelemetry in the Ashland Ranger District of the Rogue River–Siskiyou National Forest from September 2006 to October 2008. Habitat classes within Spotted Owl home ranges were characterized using a remote-sensed vegetation map of the study area. Estimates of monthly survival ranged from 0. 89 to 1. 0 and were positively correlated with the number of late-seral habitat patches and the amount of edge, and negatively correlated with the mean nearest neighbor distance between late-seral habitats.

40|$|Due to its {{dependence}} on mature forests (e. g., Reynolds et al. 1992, Bright-Smith and Mannan 1994, Squires and Ruggiero 1996, Beier and Drennan 1997), and uncertainty regarding its population status, the U. S. Forest Service (USFS) and Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) have classified the Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis; hereafter, “goshawk”) as a Sensitive Species, and the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) considers the Northern Goshawk a Species of Special Concern. Due to conservation concern, the effects of management actions on this species should be evaluated. However, {{it is difficult to}} evaluate management actions, because goshawk spatial-use patterns are poorly understood, especially in naturally fragmented forests of the intermountain west such as southern Idaho and northern Nevada. Currently, most goshawk habitat is managed using guidelines designed for a different (intact forest vs. fragmented) ecosystem in Arizona (Reynolds et al. 1992). The purpose of our study was to describe goshawk home ranges in a naturally fragmented forest landscape in south-central Idaho. Herein, we describe nesting season home-range characteristics for six radio-tagged adult male Northern Goshawks in south-central Idaho and compare them with home ranges described elsewhere. We chose to study males because they are the primary hunters and food providers for females and young (Reynolds and Meslow 1984), and therefore, have the highest resource requirements during the nesting season.

Results indicated that both species exhibited strong fine-scale site fidelity and reduced variation in range size across sexes and seasons.

Mean <b>home-range</b> and core-area <b>sizes</b> of water voles (946. 3 and 156. 6  m) were about twice that of Cabrera voles (418. 2 and 55. 1  m).

Inter-specific space sharing was restricted to areas outside the centre of activity of animals, as no core-area overlap was ever recorded between Cabrera and water voles. Taken together, results support the view that co-existence of Cabrera and water voles in Mediterranean patchy habitats may in part result from spatial segregation among individuals, which may reflect competitive displacement or small-scale habitat partitioning.

In this location, {{because much of the}} timber was harvested in the late 1940 s and early 1950 s, the available habitat largely consisted of younger trees (e. g., less than 45 years old), not generally considered prime habitat for this species. From 1992 to 1995, I observed seven groups of red-cockaded woodpeckers to determine year-round <b>home-range</b> <b>size.</b> Most of the previous home-range studies on this species used the minimum convex polygon approach to estimate the size of the home range. I compared the minimum convex polygon and fixed kernel home-range estimation methods for each group. I found that the fixed kernel method gave consistently smaller estimates of home range than did the minimum convex polygon, a result directly related to the methodologies of the techniques. Mean home-range sizes for the 95 % level were 56. 9 f 5. 2 S. E. ha with the fixed kernel versus 91. 9 & 11. 7 S. E. ha with the minimum convex polygon. Core area (50 %) means were 4. 5 f 0. 5 S. E. ha for the fixed kernel versus 16. 7 f 2. 4 S. E. ha with the minimum convex polygon. It is recommended that future home-range studies use the fixed kernel estimator rather than the minimum convex polygon as it gives a more realistic and appropriate depiction of the area actually used by the birds within a given group. In estimating the number of groups that may be accommodated in a particular area, the mean <b>home-range</b> <b>size</b> as well as its shape need to be considered. <b>Home-range</b> <b>size</b> estimates at the Savannah River Site were similar to those obtained elsewhere in the species' range.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{high-quality}} habitat patches, their distribution, and the resource accessibility therein {{play a key}} role in regulating habitat effects on reproductive success. Heterogeneous habitats offer non-substitutable resources (e. g. nest sites and food) and substitutable resources (e. g. different types of food) in close proximity, thereby facilitating landscape complementation and supplementation. However, it remains poorly understood how spatial resource separation in homogeneous agricultural landscapes affects reproductive success. To fll this gap, we investigated the relationships between farmland heterogeneity and little owl (Athene noctua) reproductive success, including potential indirect effects of the heterogeneitydependent <b>home-range</b> <b>size</b> on reproduction. Little owl home-ranges were related to feld heterogeneity in summer and to structural heterogeneity in winter.

By defining the response of juvenile sharks to highly variable freshwater flow events, this research provides useful information for understanding species behaviour in a dynamic and changing climate, and contributes towards effective management of tropical river systems...|$|R
40|$|Although it {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus (L. 1758)) may migrate seasonally in areas with snow gradients, this behaviour remains scarcely understood. From 1999 to 2002, radio-tracking techniques in an Italian alpine area showed that 40 % of the 32 monitored roe deer migrated (12. 0 ± 6. 2 km, mean ± SD) from the high-elevation summer ranges to the low-elevation winter ranges. Proportions of migratory deer were similar for fawns and adults and for males and females. We documented a mixed migration strategy, with most deer migrating once to the winter range in years of heavy snowfalls, but many deer migrating inconsistently or only {{for a short period}} to the winter range in one year with very scarce snowfalls. Seasonal <b>home-range</b> <b>sizes</b> were similar for migratory and stationary deer, except in a winter with very shallow snow when migrators used unusually large home ranges. In all seasons, migrators showed a lower within home range site fidelity than did stationary deer. Our results indicate that seasonal migrations may be a common strategy exhibited by roe deer living in mountain areas to avoid deep snow, and that variability in climatic conditions might be responsible for the development of variable spatial strategies...|$|R
40|$|Home range size, travel distances, and {{population}} {{density of the}} great spotted kiwi (Apteryx haastii) were investigated in the North Branch of the Hurunui River. Radio tracking was conducted on 10 great spotted kiwi between Dec 2007 and Apr 2008. The estimated minimum <b>home-range</b> <b>sizes</b> were determined using the concave polygon method and ranged between 19. 6 ha and 35. 4 ha, {{with a mean of}} 29. 3 ha (± 1. 6 SEM). The observed nightly distances travelled per hour varied from 7 to 433 m (n = 569). Most estimates of travel distances (73 %) were clustered in the classes from 0 - 150 m/hour, and distances over 200 m/hour were seldom achieved (only c. 7 % of distances). The kiwi population in the Mainland Island site on the western North Branch of the Hurunui River was estimated to hold around 290 birds in total. Population density for the entire North Branch area was estimated to be 2 pairs/km² and when including subadults, 5 birds/km². Our estimate of home range size is larger but with more variation than found in other studies. Differences in population density estimates between our study and those in the Hurunui and Arthurs Pass district may be due to different objectives and method...|$|R
40|$|Between March, 1969 and July, 1970, 16 badgers (Taxidea taxus) {{were caught}} and fitted with radio {{transmitters}} {{in the southern}} part of Curlew Valley. The animals were followed telemetrically; seven animals contributed sufficient data from which home-range, movement and activity patterns could be discerned. The aver age annual <b>home-range</b> <b>size</b> of five females was 664 acres (± s. d. 99. 5 acres). Female home-range sizes were approximately the same within crested wheat-grass (Agropyron aristatum) and sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) vegetation types, with greater distances traveled each night by females in the crested wheat-grass. Both <b>home-range</b> <b>size</b> and total movement were less during winter in the one badger observed during more than one season. The average home range of two males followed between September and mid-December was 1, 440 acreas, twice the average female <b>home-range</b> <b>size.</b> The necropsy of badgers in the study collection and a scat collection yielded information on the food habits and breeding biology of badgers in Curlew Valley. Many prey species were used, but mice were the most frequently eaten food item. Badgers bred between mid-July and the end of August. Delayed implantation PE sisted until approximately January 26. Pregnant females gave birth to an average of 2. 2 young about April 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} home-range {{characteristics and}} habitat selection by Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) in an unburned, boreal forest landscape managed by mosaic harvesting in Quebec, Canada. Habitat selection by this species was specifically examined to determine home-range establishment and foraging activities. We hypothesized that Black-backed Woodpeckers {{would respond to}} harvesting by adjusting their <b>home-range</b> <b>size</b> {{as a function of}} the amount of dead wood available. Twenty-two birds were tracked using radiotelemetry, and reliable estimates of <b>home-range</b> <b>size</b> were obtained for seven breeding individuals (six males and one female). The average <b>home-range</b> <b>size</b> was 151. 5 ± 18. 8 ha (range: 100. 4 - 256. 4 ha). Our results indicate that this species establishes home ranges in areas where both open and forested habitats are available. However, during foraging activities, individuals preferentially selected areas dominated by old coniferous stands. The study also showed that the spatial distribution of preferred foraging habitat patches influenced space use, with home-range area increasing with the median distance between old coniferous habitat patches available within the landscape. Finally, these data show that Black-backed Woodpeckers may successfully breed in an unburned forest with at least 35 m 3 ha- 1 of dead wood, of which 42 % (15 m 3 ha- 1) is represented by dead wood at the early decay stage...|$|E
40|$|Cheetah Acinonyx jubatus <b>home-range</b> <b>size</b> {{and habitat}} use were {{analysed}} using radio-tracking data {{collected in the}} southern district of the Kruger National Park (KNP) between 1987 and 1990. Meaningful estimates of <b>home-range</b> <b>size,</b> using the 95 % minimum convex polygon method, were 126 km 2 for a three-male cheetah coalition, 195 km 2 for a solitary male, and 150 km 2 and 171 km 2 for two female cheetahs. Although cheetahs used all habitats according to their availability, they did show a preference for open savanna habitat because their core or total home ranges centred on these habitats. Female cheetahs used denser woodland habitat more frequently than males, as {{they seemed to be}} influenced by the distribution of their main prey, impala Aepyceros melampus, which also preferred denser woodland habitat...|$|E
40|$|Elasmobranchs {{living in}} rivers and {{estuaries}} may be highly susceptible to environmental and anthropogenic changes to coastal habitats. To address this, patterns of movement of 67 juvenile bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) {{were examined in}} the Caloosahatchee River between 2003 and 2006 using an array of 25 acoustic receivers. Individuals were monitored for periods of 1 – 460 days with most present for periods of weeks to months. Individuals utilised the entire monitored section of the river (∼ 27 km) and also moved upriver beyond {{the extent of the}} acoustic array. Daily activity spaces of individuals ranged from 0 to 14 km with most < 5 km. Monthly mean home ranges were 0. 9 – 5. 6 km and although <b>home-range</b> <b>sizes</b> were consistent through time, location of individuals within the river changed through time. Individuals moved upstream during the day and downstream at night and this pattern persisted across years. Based on data collected from depth transmitters in 2006, individuals swam closer to the surface at night and remained in deeper water during the day, suggesting further diurnal patterns in habitat use. Long-term consistent use of this habitat by young C. leucas suggests this population is highly dependent on the Caloosahatchee River as a nursery area...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDespite a long {{historical}} record of radio-tracking analyses, basic home-range information is still lacking for most common waterfowl species, {{especially during the}} winter. We investigated how dabbling duck home ranges and daily foraging movements are influenced by extrinsic (site, temperature, date) and intrinsic factors (species, sex, age). We radio-tagged and monitored 125 individuals of three duck species (mallard Anas platyrhynchos, Eurasian teal A. crecca crecca and northern pintail A. acuta) in three French wetlands over four winters. <b>Home-range</b> <b>sizes</b> for a given species varied greatly among our study sites. Moreover, species differed according to home-range structure and distance traveled to reach their foraging grounds (teal had a more patchy home range and traveled farther distances than mallards). Foraging distances increased with temperature and time (over the winter season), but this effect differed among species, suggesting that they behave differently in response to food depletion and/or cold weather. The commuting behavior (i. e., the decision to leave the roost at night for foraging) differed among species and season. Teals were more risk-prone because {{they were more likely}} to leave the roost at night. In our study, ducks foraged at distances of 1 – 2 km from roosts, whereas distances of 2 – 48 km have been recorded in North America. We suggest that food supply, hunting pressure or population density may account for these inter-continental differences...|$|R
40|$|Coyotes (Canis latrans) {{have become}} common in many {{metropolitan}} areas across the United States. Recent {{research has focused}} on the urban ecology of coyotes to better our understanding of how they exist in urbanized landscapes. I summarize findings from a variety of ecological studies of coyotes in or near metropolitan areas, and focus on three areas of coyote ecology: survival rates, home range/activity, and food habits. Most studies have reported relatively high survival rates (annual S = 0. 62 - 0. 74), with vehicle collisions often a common cause of mortality. Size of coyote home ranges (mean home range sizes among urban studies ranged 5 - 13 km 2) generally exhibit a negative trend with urbanization when compared to rural studies, but this is complicated by a trend within urban landscapes in which coyote home ranges tend to increase with fragmentation and development. Studies have consistently reported a decrease in diurnal activity with human use areas. Although coyotes in some areas avoid human use areas, they are nevertheless frequently in close proximity to people. Coyote food habits in urbanized areas are similar to rural areas, in which mammalian prey and vegetation (i. e., fruit) comprise most of the diet; however, there is a trend toward more anthropogenic items from more developed areas. The relatively small <b>home-range</b> <b>sizes</b> and high survival rates suggest coyotes are successful in adjusting to an urbanized landscape...|$|R
