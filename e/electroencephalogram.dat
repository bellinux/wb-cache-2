5|$|An <b>electroencephalogram</b> (EEG) {{can assist}} in showing brain {{activity}} suggestive of {{an increased risk of}} seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure. It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the disease. In certain situations it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{can occur}} in those with acute or chronic liver disease. Episodes can be triggered by infections, GI bleeding, constipation, electrolyte problems, or certain medications. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the build up of ammonia in the blood, a substance that is normally removed by the liver. The diagnosis is typically made after ruling out other potential causes. It may be supported by blood ammonia levels, an <b>electroencephalogram,</b> or a CT scan of the brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of epilepsy is typically made based on {{observation of the}} seizure onset and the underlying cause. An <b>electroencephalogram</b> (EEG) to look for abnormal patterns of brain waves and neuroimaging (CT scan or MRI) {{to look at the}} structure of the brain are also usually part of the workup. While figuring out a specific epileptic syndrome is often attempted, it is not always possible. Video and EEG monitoring may be useful in difficult cases.|$|E

5|$|Information {{about the}} {{structure}} and function {{of the human brain}} comes from a variety of experimental methods, including animals and humans. Information about brain trauma and stroke has provided information about the function of parts of the brain and the effects of brain damage. Neuroimaging is used to visualise the brain and record brain activity. Electrophysiology is used to measure, record and monitor the electrical activity of the cortex. Measurements may be of local field potentials of cortical areas, or of the activity of a single neuron. An <b>electroencephalogram</b> can record the electrical activity of the cortex using electrodes placed non-invasively on the scalp.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} most cases of {{epilepsy}} is unknown. Some cases occur {{as the result}} of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain, and birth defects, through a process known as epileptogenesis. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the cortex of the brain. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may be partly done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests. Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an <b>electroencephalogram</b> (EEG), but a normal test does not rule out the condition.|$|E
5|$|Children who {{discontinue}} {{the diet}} after achieving seizure freedom {{have about a}} 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where {{part of the brain}} is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those that have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an <b>electroencephalogram</b> (EEG) shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with tuberous sclerosis). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and {{it has been suggested that}} children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.|$|E

40|$|Schizophrenic {{patients}} (249) {{were divided}} into those with and those without {{a family history of}} major functional psychosis. The same patients were then divided into those with entirely normal <b>electroencephalograms</b> and those whose traces contained some variant of normal. Traces were interpreted without knowledge of the patients' identities, and the question of {{the presence or absence of}} positive heredity had been decided without knowledge of the patients' electroencephalographic status, so that the discovery that normal <b>electroencephalograms</b> correlated highly significantly with positive heredity, and vice versa, commands attention.

25|$|Status epilepticus {{may occur}} {{in those with}} a history of {{epilepsy}} as well as those with an underlying problem of the brain. These underlying brain problems may include trauma, infections, or strokes among others. Diagnosis often involves checking the blood sugar, imaging of the head, a number of blood tests, and an <b>electroencephalogram.</b> Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures may present similarly. Other conditions that may also appear to be SE include low blood sugar, movement disorders, meningitis, and delirium among others.|$|E
25|$|CJD is {{believed}} to be caused by a protein known as a prion. Infectious prions are misfolded proteins that can cause normally folded proteins to become misfolded. Most cases occur spontaneously, while about 7.5% of cases are inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal dominant manner. Exposure to brain or spinal tissue from an infected person may also result in spread. There is no evidence that it can spread between people via normal contact or blood transfusions. Diagnosis involves ruling out other potential causes. An <b>electroencephalogram,</b> spinal tap, or magnetic resonance imaging may support the diagnosis.|$|E

In automobile repair, an ignition analyzer is used to show the spark waveforms for each cylinder. All of these are essentially oscilloscopes, performing the basic task of showing the changes in one or more input signals over time in an X‑Y display.|$|E
25|$|Accumulated {{observation}} {{has shown}} that dreams are strongly associated with REM rapid eye movement sleep, during which an <b>electroencephalogram</b> (EEG) shows brain activity that, among sleep states, is most like wakefulness. Participant-remembered dreams during NREM sleep are normally more mundane in comparison. During a typical lifespan, a person spends {{a total of about}} six years dreaming (which is about two hours each night). Most dreams only last 5 to 20 minutes. It is unknown where in the brain dreams originate, if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple portions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of dreaming is for the body or mind.|$|E
25|$|The main {{function}} of the ARAS is to modify and potentiate thalamic and cortical function such that <b>electroencephalogram</b> (EEG) desynchronization ensues. There are distinct differences in the brain’s electrical activity during periods of wakefulness and sleep: Low voltage fast burst brain waves (EEG desynchronization) are associated with wakefulness and REM sleep (which are electrophysiologically similar); high voltage slow waves are found during non-REM sleep. Generally speaking, when thalamic relay neurons are in burst mode the EEG is synchronized {{and when they are}} in tonic mode it is desynchronized. Stimulation of the ARAS produces EEG desynchronization by suppressing slow cortical waves (0.3–1Hz), delta waves (1–4Hz), and spindle wave oscillations (11–14Hz) and by promoting gamma band (20 – 40Hz) oscillations.|$|E

25|$|Phase {{resetting}} also {{permits the}} study of evoked activity, a term used in electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography for responses in brain activity that {{are directly related to}} stimulus-related activity. Evoked potentials and event-related potentials are obtained from an <b>electroencephalogram</b> by stimulus-locked averaging, i.e. averaging different trials at fixed latencies around the presentation of a stimulus. As a consequence, those signal components that are the same in each single measurement are conserved and all others, i.e. ongoing or spontaneous activity, are averaged out. That is, event-related potentials only reflect oscillations in brain activity that are phase-locked to the stimulus or event. Evoked activity is often considered to be independent from ongoing brain activity, although this is an ongoing debate.|$|E
25|$|Polysomnography is {{performed}} in a sleep laboratory while the patient sleeps, preferably {{at his or her}} usual sleeping time. The polysomnogram (PSG) objectively records sleep stages and respiratory events. It shows multiple channels of <b>electroencephalogram</b> (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), electrocardiogram (ECG), nasal and oral airflow, abdominal, chest and leg movements and blood oxygen levels. A single part of a polysomnogram is sometimes measured at home with portable equipment, for example oximetry, which records blood oxygen levels throughout the night. Polysomnography is not routinely used in the evaluation of patients with insomnia or circadian rhythm disorders, except as needed to rule out other disorders. It will usually be a definitive test for sleep apnea.|$|E
