We derive efficient water management and pricing plans for two of the four aquifer zones in the Central Oahu corridor, taking into account the possibility of inter-district water trade.

In this paper, a multi-criteria model in making complex decisions by Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was adopted as tool to select the preferred biomass from three typical biomass types (wood chips, palm shells and wood pellets). The multi-criteria are <b>efficiency,</b> <b>price,</b> ease to operate, Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Acidification Potential (AP). The boiler efficiency was measured by direct method in actual industrial boiler in Thailand. The prices were based on average Thailand market price as of January 2013. The ease to operate was obtained by factory operator interview. Global Warming Potentialand Acidification Potentialwere assessed by Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method. The decision weighting values for <b>efficiency,</b> <b>price,</b> ease to operate, global warming potential and acidification potential were obtained by factory management interview at 30 %, 30 %, 10 %, 20 % and 10 % respectively.

40|$|Despite a voluminous {{literature}} on groundwater management, proposals to induce efficient use through pricing or quantity regulations {{have often been}} politically infeasible. The common problem with these proposals is that current users are called on to sacrifice in order that future users will be better off. Although total welfare gains are greater than losses, present users are politically more influential than future users (some of whom are unborn) and are therefore able to block reforms. To avoid this problem of political infeasibility, a mechanism for compensating those who lose welfare due to efficient management can be provided. Compensation possibilities to enhance political feasibility have been discussed in general but have not been explicitly developed in an inter-temporal framework. Using the urban Honolulu water district, our objectives are to: 1) compute the efficient allocation of water across time and across locations, 2) compute <b>efficiency</b> <b>prices</b> needed at the margin to support the efficient allocation as a decentralized equilibrium, 3) simulate {{the effects of the}} status quo policy of pricing water at average cost of extraction and distribution, 4) estimate the topographic and temporal distribution of welfare gain/loss to users by switching from the status quo to <b>efficiency</b> <b>pricing,</b> and 5) define a lump sum compensation scheme such that the switch to <b>efficiency</b> <b>pricing</b> causes no user to be a net loser...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{documented}} that intertemporal water allocation in Hawaii (as elsewhere) is inefficient (see e. g., Moncur et. al., 1998). The result is widely {{expected to be}} early depletion of groundwater resources and the resulting need for using expensive and exotic technologies such as desalination. The problem is further complicated {{by the presence of}} saltwater underneath most of the freshwater lenses in Hawaii. Increasing groundwater extraction over time will drive the freshwater head levels lower until the existing well installations will start to pump out saltwater. Once the wells become saline, {{it is very hard to}} reverse the process. The consequences of these conditions, in terms of the economic value of waste, are unknown. Moreover, recharge of groundwater aquifer is affected by the condition of forested watersheds. Amount and nature of vegetation cover affects the rate of recharge and the amount of groundwater stored in an aquifer available for pumping. Many communities have given watersheds a practice of protective zoning that eliminated the worst threats, including road construction and subsequent urbanization that significantly reduce permeability and recharge rates. Zoning alone may no longer be sufficient for meeting the increasing demand for fresh water, however. Increasing threats to forest quality, including change in forest composition due to the rapidly growing problem of invasive species, may justify significant conservation expenditures. Maintenance of watersheds needs to be considered in an integrated framework in order to assess the size of the problem and the potential gains from policy reforms. The overall objective of this paper is to combine existing hydrological, engineering, and economic knowledge in order to estimate efficient water use in the Honolulu aquifer zone on Oahu, HI. We compare welfare gains under efficient pricing and usage with welfare under current pricing and usage. In addition, we incorporate the effects of watershed conservation in the form of probabilistic changes in recharge. We then compare the welfare gains from efficient pricing without water conservation to that with watershed conservation. Finally, we articulate practical pricing schemes (particularly block pricing) for achieving efficient use with return of water pricing revenue back to the consumers. We derive efficient water use and prices over time for the study area with and without the watershed conservation plan proposed by the state Department of Land and Natural Resource (DLNR). Present values of status-quo (pricing-at-cost), <b>efficiency</b> <b>pricing</b> alone, and <b>efficiency</b> <b>pricing</b> with additional conservation spending are compared. We show that <b>efficiency</b> <b>pricing</b> alone provides substantial welfare gains over status-quo. <b>Efficiency</b> <b>pricing</b> combined with watershed conservation improves the welfare further. Under plausible parameter values, the fall in <b>efficiency</b> <b>prices</b> afforded by conservation is more than enough to finance the conservation expenditures. This is a 'win-win-win' for water consumers, taxpayers, and environment. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is to better explore and {{understand}} the effects of agent interactions, information feedback, and adaptive learning in a repeated game of bidding in farmland auction markets. This thesis will develop a multi-agent model of farm-land auction markets {{based on data from}} the Saskatchewan Dark Brown Soil Zone of the Canadian Prairies. Several auction types will be modeled and data will be gathered on land transactions between farm agents to ascertain which auction type (if any) is best suited for farmland markets. Specifically, the model gathers information for 3 types of sealed-bid auctions, and 1 English auction and compares them on the basis of <b>efficiency,</b> <b>price</b> information revelation, stability, and with respect to repeated bidding and agent learning. The effects of auction choice on macro-level indicators, such as farm exits, retirement, financial stability, average productivity, farm size, and participation were unknown at the outset of this thesis because of the complex dynamic nature of the environment. I find that the chosen learning mechanism employed here affects both price and variance of prices in all auctions. I also find that the second-price-sealed-bid auction generates the most perceived surplus, most equitable share of surplus, and also decreases uncertainty in the common-value element of prices. A priori it was believed that auction choice would have an impact on pricing <b>efficiency,</b> <b>price</b> levels, and shares of surplus generated from auctions as predicted by theoretical works.

Also {{available by}} subscription via World Wide Webxii, 120 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThis dissertation addresses examines {{the issues involved}} in integrating the efficient use of resources and resulting revenues. Three essays in this dissertation focus on groundwater resources {{on the island of}} Oahu (Hawaii) to demonstrate the complexity of efficient resource use and its dependence on the use of resource management revenues and changes in other resources. First essay addresses welfare effects and political feasibility of efficient groundwater usage and pricing. Proposals for marginal cost water pricing have often been found to be politically infeasible because current users lose welfare through higher prices though future users gain and overall welfare increases. The essay shows how <b>efficiency</b> <b>pricing</b> can be rendered Pareto-improving, and thus politically feasible, by using the <b>efficiency</b> <b>pricing</b> revenue to compensate the users who suffer a loss. A method is also provided for determining efficient spatial and inter-temporal water management, and resulting welfare effects, for a system with consumption at significantly different elevations supplied from a renewable coastal aquifer, which is subject to salinity if over-extracted. Second essay examines the interrelationship between efficient groundwater usage and watershed conservation. Since <b>efficiency</b> <b>prices</b> are politically unattractive due to being generally higher than inefficient, status quo prices, watershed conservation may be considered as an alternative that can help to preserve the groundwater supplies by avoiding loss of recharge. By simulating the two pricing policies under alternate watershed conservation scenarios, the essay finds that watershed conservation {{is not likely to be}} beneficial without pricing reform. In addition, delay in adopting pricing reform substantially reduces the resulting gains. Third essay addresses the issue of optimally recycling of corrective revenues in a general equilibrium framework. The double dividend literature, which explores the issue of the effect of recycling of corrective revenues on the size of the corrective price or tax, makes highly restrictive assumptions that compromise the applicability of its results. Using a generalized framework, this essay seeks to clarify the double dividend issue by examining the conditions under which environmental tax may be a better or worse instrument to raise revenue compared with non-environmental taxes...|$|R
