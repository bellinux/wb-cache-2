40|$|In this Comment, {{the author}} {{examines}} {{the consequences of}} using substantially identical rules to govern <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> in both private employers and private schools. The author explores the law that governs private <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> and the justifications that courts have accepted <b>for</b> private <b>affirmative</b> <b>action,</b> focusing on whether these justifications are internal or external to the defendant. The author contends that the Supreme Court’s dicta in Johnson v.

In contrast to private employers and private colleges, the author proposes that K- 12 private schools {{be able to use}} external imbalances to justify their <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> policies because such <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> benefits society more than currently permitted forms of <b>affirmative</b> <b>action...</b>|$|R

Bollinger {{confirms that the}} Court applies a different strict scrutiny test <b>for</b> challenges to <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> programs aimed at improving diversity in the classroom than the test it applies to challenges to programs aimed at achieving racial equality in the workplace. In reviewing challenges to two <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> admissions policies, the Court confirmed {{that there is a}} compelling governmental interest in achieving diversity in the classroom. The Court also articulated a “narrowly tailored” test that is arguably more appropriate for evaluating challenges to <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> programs aimed at achieving diversity in the classroom than those designed to increase racial equality in the workplace. The Court has since required that a race-conscious program not be upheld under the Constitution unless it passes the “strict scrutiny test,” first articulated by Justice Powell in Regents of the University of California at Davis v. Bakke. Post-Bakke challenges more clearly defined the test, requiring state or federal entities defending any race-conscious program to demonstrate that there was a compelling governmental interest in the program, and to establish that the program was narrowly tailored to meet that interest. This article identifies the new strict scrutiny test and considers the reason for creating a separate definition of strict scrutiny <b>for</b> evaluating <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> policies that achieve diversity in the classroom.

While practising as a doctor in Alor Setar, Mahathir became active in UMNO; by the time of the first general election for the independent state of Malaya in 1959, he was the chairman of the party in Kedah. Despite his prominence in UMNO, Mahathir was not a candidate in the 1959 election, ruling himself out following a disagreement with then Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman. The relationship between the two Kedahans had been strained since Mahathir had criticised Abdul Rahman's agreement to the retention of British and Commonwealth forces in Malaya after independence. Now Abdul Rahman opposed Mahathir's plans to introduce minimum educational qualifications for UMNO candidates. For Mahathir this was a significant enough slight to delay his entry into national politics in protest. The delay did not last for long. In the following general election in 1964, he was elected as the federal parliamentarian for the Alor Setar-based seat of Kota Setar Selatan.|$|E
