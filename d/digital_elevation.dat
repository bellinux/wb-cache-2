500|$|The team's {{goal was}} to create the [...] "best, most {{realistic}} civilian flight simulator", which would provide an immersive world for the player. Radio communications between ATCs, AI planes and the player occur in real-time: a [...] "sophisticated audio splicing system" [...] gathers pre-recorded voice fragments into contextually appropriate sentences. The team recorded the engine noise {{of each of the}} game's planes, and they designed cockpits more interactive than those in Flight Unlimited. Roughly 300 times more terrain area was included in Flight Unlimited II than in its predecessor. To generate the terrain, the team combined <b>digital</b> <b>elevation</b> maps with satellite imagery rendered at four square meters per pixel. The images were taken at 9:30am, because the long shadows provided an illusion of depth. 3D models were used for all buildings taller than nine stories. Because of the terrain detail, the game was the first to allow players to follow VFR. Initially, the team planned to include only VFR flight, but they later enabled IFR to [...] "ease navigation". The team hoped to add more terrain and planes and a multiplayer feature after the game's release.|$|E

Our objective was to determine if landscape features could be used to determine model parameters that could successfully be transferred to ungauged basins and the uncertainty of such estimates be simultaneously assessed. Here we report preliminary results where calibrated model parameters from a variety of mountain watersheds are compared to basin area, drainage density and other attributes derived from <b>digital</b> <b>elevations</b> models. These results indicate that some model parameters exhibit a relation to basin characteristics.

40|$|Using {{different}} combinations of 29 Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) images, 43 <b>Digital</b> <b>Elevations</b> Models (DEM) were generated adopting SAR Interferometry (InSAR) technique. Due to sand movement in desert terrain, there is a poor phase correlation between different SAR images. Therefore, suitable methodology for generating DEMs of Kuwait desert terrain using InSAR technique were worked out. Time series analysis was adopted to derive the best DEM out of 43 DEMs. The problems related to phase de-correlation over desert terrain are discussed. Various errors associated with the DEM generation are discussed which include atmospheric effects, penetration into soil medium, sand movement.

2500|$|Geodetic {{methods are}} an {{indirect}} method for {{the determination of}} mass balance of glacier. Maps of a glacier made at two different points in time can be compared and the difference in glacier thickness observed {{used to determine the}} mass balance over a span of years. This is best accomplished today using Differential Global Positioning System. Sometimes the earliest data for the glacier surface profiles is from images that are used to make topographical maps and <b>digital</b> <b>elevation</b> models. Aerial mapping or photogrammetry is now used to cover larger glaciers and icecaps such found in Antarctica and Greenland, however, because of the problems of establishing accurate ground control points in mountainous terrain, and correlating features in snow and where shading is common, elevation errors are typically not less than 10m (32ft). Laser altimetry provides a measurement of the elevation of a glacier along a specific path, e.g., the glacier centerline. The difference of two such measurements is the change in thickness, which provides mass balance over the time interval between the measurements. [...] Again a good method over a span of time but not for annual change detection. The value of geodetic programs is providing an independent check of traditional mass balance work, by comparing the cumulative changes over ten or more years.|$|E

40|$|This paper compares {{precision}} field-strength measurements {{taken by}} a Rohde & Schwarz FSH- 3 portable spectrum analyzer with simulation results derived from the ITM coverage prediction model (Irregular Terrain Model), also known as NTIA-ITS Longley-Rice model, {{in conjunction with the}} 3 -arc-second SRTM (Satellite Radar Topography Mission) geographical data, the propagation predictions of ITU-R Recommendation P. 1546 and those of the empirical Hata-Davidson model using HAAT. ITU-R P. 1546 and Hata-Davidson models exhibit higher errors at longer distances and therefore necessary corrections should be introduced in the models in order to increase propagation prediction accuracy. Especially, measurements results show that ITU-R P. 1546, on average, underestimates the field strength at distances longer than 50 km. The Longley-Rice model using the terrain <b>digital</b> <b>elevations</b> is more accurate, as expected, and its results are closer to the measurement data...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} and evaluates {{a new approach}} for modeling pixel level error in fine-resolution <b>digital</b> <b>elevations</b> models (DEMs), addressing shortcomings of previous studies related to: (1) the assumption of normality for pixel level errors; (2) the scale-dependence {{of the relationship between}} local topographic roughness (LTR) and error; and (3) the spatial autocorrelation of error. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and spatial lag (SL) regression are used to predict DEM errors for integration into geomorphic change detection analyses. The modeling approach is tested using two terrestrial LiDAR datasets. Pixel level errors prove predominantly non-normally distributed and a new measure for summarizing asymmetric error distributions is introduced. Smaller radii LTR are found to produce better fit models, but also incomplete and less conservative error grids. Lastly, although SL models account for spatial autocorrelation of errors better than OLS models, they prove overly conservative and inferior to at predicting DEM error grids...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: All {{digital data}} contain error {{and many are}} uncertain. <b>Digital</b> models of <b>elevation</b> {{surfaces}} consist of files containing large numbers of measurements representing {{the height of the}} surface of the earth, and therefore a proportion of those measurements are very likely to be subject to some level of error and uncertainty. The collection and handling of such data and their associated uncertainties has been a subject of considerable research, which has focused largely upon the description of the effects of interpolation and resolution uncertainties, as well as modelling the occurrence of errors. However, <b>digital</b> models of <b>elevation</b> derived from new technologies employing active methods of laser and radar ranging are becoming more widespread, and past research will need to be re-evaluated in the near future to accommodate such new data products. In this paper we review the source and nature of errors in <b>digital</b> models of <b>elevation,</b> and in the derivatives of such models. We examine the correction of errors and assessment of fitness for use, and finally we identify some priorities for future research...|$|R
