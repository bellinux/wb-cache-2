5|$|Unemployment {{had more}} than tripled by late November 2008, with over 7000 {{registered}} jobseekers (about 4% of the workforce) compared to just 2136 {{at the end of}} August 2008. As 80% of household debt is indexed and another 13% denominated in foreign currencies, debt payment is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> costly. Since October 2008, 14% of the workforce have experienced reductions in pay, and around 7% have had their working hours reduced. According {{to the president of the}} Icelandic Federation of Labour (ASÍ), Gylfi Arnbjörnsson, these figures are lower than expected. 85% of those registered as unemployed in Iceland stated that they lost their job in October, after the economic collapse.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} design {{decision}} Wertich made {{related to the}} complexity of the game's economic system. Due to the innovations he planned to introduce to the mechanics, and because the supply and demand-based gameplay of Settlers III was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> intricate than in previous titles, he felt that forcing players to concentrate too much on logistics would serve as an unwelcome distraction, and so decided to remove the need for a road network. Instead, settlers would have the freedom to move anywhere within the player's settlement, with the AI handling pathfinding. Another early decision was that the different races in Settlers III wouldn't just look different, they would have different abilities, different economic models and certain buildings unique to each one. Wertich, in consultation with Hertzler, also decided to create the game in high color, a first for the series, which had used 8-bit color for previous titles.|$|E

25|$|At 3:30pm two umpires {{emerged from}} the players' race leading from the {{dressing}} rooms. The crowd roared its approval. It seemed there was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> play. The cordon of policemen, reinforced after the spectator intrusions of the first day, respectfully made way to allow the umpires to pass. But wait! Surely Tom Brooks {{does not have a}} beard. Robin Bailhache, slight in build though he is, is slightly more substantial than the youthful beanpole figure making his way to the centre. It took Bill Watkins, the groundsman at the M.C.G. to detect the impersonation. He hurried from his post by the covers in the centre of the ground to intercept the impostors and turn them back from whence they came. In tribute to a skilful piece of improvised humour, police sergeant Brian Watkins allowed them to make good their escape, instead of conducting them to the local lock-up.|$|E
25|$|Den Watts {{was one of}} the {{original}} twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. The character of Den was originally going to be named Jack and he, his wife and adopted daughter were to be the occupants of the soap's local pub, now famously known as The Queen Vic. Holland, who had worked as a barman in his youth, called upon his own personal experiences to invent the Watts family and the pub they lived in. Holland and Smith had always been critical of the way pubs had been portrayed on television feeling they lacked vitality and life, so they were determined that their pub and occupants were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> realistic. The Watts were seen by Holland as integral to the show's success, partly because he had already guessed that the pub {{was going to be a}} monstrous battleground where emotions would run high on a regular basis, and also because the occupants would be providing the majority of the drama.|$|E
25|$|With the new ball due six overs {{into the}} fourth day Sri Lankan wickets fell thick and fast, half the team falling before lunch, the last of which being opener Michael Vandort who {{narrowly}} missed out on being the fifth batsmen ever to hold his wicket throughout an entire innings. England took to the crease just before lunch with a very slow run rate that came only from Strauss - Trescothick fell after nine runs, none of them contributed by him. The third man, Alastair Cook held out {{for the rest of}} the innings though achieving 34 not out; during this time Strauss fell to a controversial catch, replays showed it popped off his pads. Pietersen, wanting to end the Test quickly, took the wicket with his usual speed, taking 13 runs off 25 balls his confidence assured by a catch by the tourists' skipper to be called a no ball, and a further two no balls which he took boundaries off. However, his cockiness proved his downfall as he lashed out at a ball from Murali, the only bowler to take wickets in the second innings, and was caught plumb. Collingwood soon fell for 3 and it seemed as if the easy target of 78 was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> of a struggle but Cook, remaining from the second partnership, took two runs and two byes and skipper Flintoff, who done nothing with his first three balls, drove Murali down the ground to long on for four on his fourth ball to win the match, and his third in a row as English skipper.|$|E

[...] Nearly two-thirds of the Marines, {{including}} their commanders James T. Conway and James Mattis, {{had participated in the}} invasion in 2003. [...] Conway planned on gradually reestablishing control over Anbar Province using a methodical counterinsurgency program, showing respect for the population and training the Iraqi Army and police using military transition teams (based on the Combined Action Program used by the Marines during the Vietnam War). During the transition of authority between the MEF and the 82nd Airborne it became obvious that western Iraq was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> problematic for the Marines than southern Iraq had been.|$|E

But {{there were a couple}} of things that we admit could have been done better". A demo of the game showed a more open gameplay style and a better AI for the enemies, who would actively go after the player. There are a set number of enemies set on the map that will begin reacting to the player's presence once the first shot has been fired. Groups of enemies farther away send units up to see what is happening and add to the combat while enemies directly in front of the player will join in and take cover quickly.|$|E

500|$|On February 21, 2014, Mayor Harpole {{spoke about}} the refugee {{population}} in Amarillo. According to 2007-2012 State Department data from U.S. Representative Mac Thornberry, Amarillo received {{the highest number of}} refugees per capita than any other Texas city. According to Harpole, the city has struggled with accommodating a high number of foreign language speakers in areas like education and 911 response. Harpole told the Texas Tribune, [...] "We’ve raised some red flags and said this isn’t good for some entities in the city or for the refugees themselves". Many refugees worked in meatpacking plants in the area, but Harpole expressed concern that jobs were declining and believed [...] "it’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> difficult for the refugees to do well" [...] in Amarillo. After requests from Harpole, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission agreed with various refugee resettlement organizations in late 2013 that new placements in Amarillo would be limited to family reunification. However, Harpole wished to make clear, [...] "We don’t want to get the idea out that we are not supportive of refugees. We’ve been very accepting. But we also need to keep it in a ratio that's healthy for the refugees as well as the residents".|$|E

500|$|In November 2003, Barry Weiss {{spoke to}} Billboard {{and said that}} In the Zone was being {{promoted}} in a worldwide level, exhausting areas such as print and electronic media, television, radio and video {{to raise awareness of}} the album's release. In addition, Jive worked with lifestyle marketer the Karpel Group to market the album to the gay community. Other broader-based marketing efforts included a tie-in with marketing company LidRock, where after ordering a soda at Sbarro, customers received a cup featuring the artwork and a three-inch disc in the lid featuring [...] "Brave New Girl" [...] and songs by two other artists. In December 2003, an updated LidRock disc included a remix of [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] without Madonna, as well as songs by fellow Jive acts Nick Cannon and Bowling for Soup. Regal Theaters also showed a short film that included footage of the making of Spears's music videos. Two national TV advertising campaigns began on November 1, 2003, one with a teaser ad in American comedy show Saturday Night Live and another exclusively on MTV. No sponsored cross-marketing campaigns were planned, as Larry Rudolph explained, [...] " [...] it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> about the music than about corporate tie-ins."
