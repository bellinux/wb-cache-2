5|$|The {{following}} {{night on}} Raw, Lesnar challenged Goldberg {{to a final}} match at WrestleMania 33. On the February 6 episode of Raw, Goldberg would accept Lesnar's challenge whilst also being named number one contender for Kevin Owens' Universal Championship, which he won at Fastlane thus turning his match with Lesnar into a title match. At WrestleMania 33, Lesnar beat Goldberg to win his fifth world title in WWE and {{the first man to}} have won both the WWE Championship and Universal Championship. Lesnar also became the second person to <b>kick-out</b> from Goldberg's Jackhammer and gave him the first clean singles loss of his professional wrestling career. After several weeks of feuding, Lesnar's first title defense came at the inaugural Great Balls of Fire event on July 9, 2017, where he successfully retained against Samoa Joe, before defeating him a second time for the title at a live event.|$|E
25|$|He joined Raith Rovers in {{the close}} season of 1986, helping them win {{promotion}} from the Scottish Second Division {{in his first}} season. In September 1987, McAlpine added a fourth goal to his career total, scoring directly from a <b>kick-out</b> for Raith against Kilmarnock. He left Raith after two seasons, McAlpine had intended to retire.|$|E
25|$|After that, Goldberg {{defended the}} Universal Championship against Brock Lesnar. Lesnar {{performed}} three German suplexes on Goldberg, who quickly recovered and performed two spears on Lesnar, who then {{rolled out of}} the ring. Goldberg then performed a spear on Lesnar through the barricade into the timekeepers area. Goldberg got Lesnar back into the ring and attempted a Jackhammer, but Lesnar countered and attempted an F-5 on Goldberg, who also countered and performed another spear, followed by a Jackhammer on Lesnar, who became {{the first man to}} <b>kick-out</b> of the spear-Jackhammer combo. Goldberg attempted a fifth spear, but Lesnar avoided Goldberg and performed seven more German suplexes on him. Lesnar then performed an F-5 on Goldberg to win his first Universal Championship and gave Goldberg his first clean singles loss of his career. This win also made Lesnar the first wrestler to win both the WWE Championship and Universal Championship.|$|E
50|$|In 1987, Millane won {{the best}} and fairest award. He found his place on the wing and was a footballer known for his {{toughness}} and attitude towards the game. He was most likely the recipient {{on the end of}} the <b>kick-outs</b> because of his strength. Although his skills were occasionally poor, at his best he found and used the football well, and became a favourite to fans at Victoria Park.|$|R
50|$|As an arcade game, TWC offers {{instant play}} but lacks {{longevity}} features {{found in many}} later soccer games (particularly those designed for the home market) {{such as the ability}} to influence the careers of individual players, league formats or multi-season planning. Neither does it incorporate a management dimension that typically includes injuries, player markets and gate receipts. Energy levels are not simulated and so players never tire. Although in Single-Player mode the strength of the CPU teams increases from round to round, individual player attributes are not supported and so all the players in a given team are identical in behavior and ability. Fouling is not possible in TWC and therefore there are no free kicks, penalty kicks, drop balls, yellow or red cards; all tackles are considered clean (although not all tackles are successful). However, the gameplay does feature goal kicks, corner kicks, throw-ins and goalkeeper <b>kick-outs.</b>|$|R
25|$|Parallel to {{this success}} ran Toyota’s feud with future tag-team partner Toshiyo Yamada. Initially, {{following}} Tokyo Sweethearts' success, the AJW braintrust {{felt they could}} well be the new Beauty Pair or Crush Gals. However, Toyota's real chemistry came not with Shimoda but with Yamada, whose style was unlike Toyota's and provided more of a contrast. Yamada was a slightly built, short-haired, kicking specialist, who idolized both Chigusa Nagayo and Akira Maeda. Unlike other wrestlers who rely on kicks and submissions, Yamada could also work the rapid-paced matches and was accomplished at building to near-falls with repeated <b>kick-outs</b> at the last possible moment. To begin with, however, Toyota and Yamada were opponents rather than partners. Between 1989 and 1991 they wrestled many times. At the start of 1992, the two won their first tag team championship when they defeated KAORU and Lady Apache in Tokyo on January 19 for the UWA Women's World Tag Team Championship.|$|R
25|$|However, {{after the}} second half began, the game took on a {{different}} complexion as Dublin seized the lead by scoring three consecutive points. However, Mayo reclaimed the lead early into the half as Lee Keegan scored a goal to put his team one point ahead. The talking point of the match occurred in the 48th minute, as Dublin's John Small, who had previously received a yellow card in the first half, was sent off for a foul on Colm Boyle. However, Donal Vaughan of Mayo was also sent off after striking Small in the face {{in retaliation for the}} foul. This left both teams reduced to fourteen men for the remaining duration of the game. After seventy minutes of the game had elapsed, the teams were tied at 1-16 apiece, and it appeared that the game was destined for a draw and replay. In the seventy-first minute, Mayo were awarded a kickable free and an opportunity to go ahead. Cillian O'Connor, who had missed a free under a similar scenario in the previous final, took the kick, and missed, having it strike the post and rebound away from goal. Ciarán Kilkenny was given a black card by the referee for cynical play. Then, with a mere minute of the six additional minutes remaining, Diarmuid Connolly was fouled approximately forty-five metres from the Mayo goal, leaving Dublin with a kick to win the game. Dean Rock, the son of Barney Rock, {{one of the most famous}} Gaelic footballers from the capital, took the free. Lee Keegan controversially threw a GPS device at Rock as he took the free, yet the Dubliner was undeterred and converted. This left the defending champions one point ahead, and after reclaiming the ball from the Mayo <b>kick-out,</b> Dublin maintained possession until the final whistle was blown. Stephen Cluxton, the Dublin captain, then lifted the Sam Maguire Cup for the fifth time in seven years.|$|E

5000|$|The Macy Program, [...] "begun in 1985 {{with funding}} from the Macy Foundation," [...] attracts intelligent, {{hard-working}} children and preparing them for exceptionally selective colleges. The Macy program has been expanded to serve 1,200 students. The current Macy coordinator is Ernesta Consolazio. The Macy Honors Gifted Program in the Sciences and Humanities has its own teachers, and a nine-period day compared to the regular New York City eight-period day. The program offers Specialized and Advanced Technology (SMT) courses, Science, Math, English, Law, Government, Philosophy and Great Books. All students in the program are required to have a minimum average of 80 and not to fail any courses. When Macy students are removed from the program, they are placed in Excel, a special Macy-run program just for its <b>kick-outs</b> and drop-outs, before getting fully demoted to the lower programs. From at least 1998 to 2002 some students went directly into the Excel program.|$|R
5000|$|James Caldwell of Pro Wrestling Torch {{said that}} it was [...] "unfortunate there were so many {{finisher}} <b>kick-outs</b> on this show, but {{that seems to be the}} trend these days". Caldwell rated the four-way match the best of the show at 4.5 stars out of 5, commenting that [...] "strong build-up" [...] resulted in a [...] "strong title match", with further positives including that the [...] "Owens-Zayn feud was enhanced, Cesaro's amazing in-ring skills were captured, and Miz's post-Mania resurgence continued". The next-best rated match was the main event at 3.75 stars: a [...] "very physical, PPV main event-worthy battle continuing to build up Styles's strong first year in WWE. Reigns plays the part well of a PPV main-eventer when matched up with the right opponent, like Styles, but not someone like Sheamus." [...] Also, Styles took a [...] "crazy amount of punishment" [...] during the match. The rest of the matches of the event were less well received, being rated either 2.25 or 2.5 stars. Corbin's pre-show performance showed he had [...] "a lot of work to do to belong" [...] on the main roster; the Tornado tag match was rushed and [...] "disorganized"; Rusev winning the U.S. Championship was a positive; the tag title match was mostly a [...] "basic TV-quality action" [...] except for a [...] "good nearfall for The Vaudevillains"; while the Asylum match had a [...] "good" [...] finish, but was dragged down by [...] "an overly-gimmicky WWE cage match concept" [...] and the [...] "middle portion being a big struggle trying to follow the four-way".|$|R

5000|$|Mayo manager Stephen Rochford {{speaking}} {{after the}} match said [...] "We did our analysis on Dublin. They had pushed with a {{formation in the}} first game, pushing four guys inside. They were trying to cut off our short <b>kick-out</b> and as the game developed in the drawn game they were getting more comfort or more reward and it was probably something {{they were going to}} try and maximise further. Robbie’s <b>kick-out</b> gave us a bit more length, a bit more option and that was the reason behind it, When you look at a one-point defeat you look at every single play, every single decision, every single moment in it and question what could have been. That’s just the way it is.” ...|$|E
