For a recent generation of I-O professionals, this was our introduction to the scientist-practitioner gap.

25|$|The {{reign of}} shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi after the {{deposition}} of Mossadegh in 1953, {{was the most}} prosperous era for the Jews of Iran. In the 1970s, only 10 percent of Iranian Jews were classified as impoverished; 80 percent were middle class and 10 percent wealthy. Although Jews accounted for {{only a small percentage}} of Iran's population, in 1979 two of the 18 members of the Iranian Academy of Sciences, 80 of the 4,000 university lecturers, and 600 of the 10,000 physicians in Iran were Jews. An important factor in economic improvement of the Jews was close relations between the Shah and the state of Israel.

25|$|Upon {{the death}} of Dost Muhammad in 1863, he was succeeded by his son, Sher Ali Khan. However, three years later, his older brother Mohammad Afzal Khan overthrew him. In 1868, Mohammad Afzal Khan was himself overthrown and {{replaced}} as Emir by Sher Ali, who returned to the Throne. Sher Ali had spent his <b>few</b> <b>short</b> <b>years</b> in exile in Russia. His return as Emir led to new conflicts with Britain. Subsequently, the British marched on 21 November 1878 into Afghanistan and Emir Sher Ali was forced to flee again to Russia, but he died in 1879 in Mazar-i-Sharif. His successor, Mohammad Yaqub Khan, sought solutions for peace with Russia and gave them a greater say in Afghanistan's foreign policy. However, when the British envoy Sir Louis Cavagnari was killed in Kabul on the 3 September 1879, the British offered to accept Abdur Rahman Khan as Emir. The British concluded a peace treaty with the Afghans in 1880, and withdrew again in 1881 from Afghanistan. The British in 1893 forced Afghanistan to consent to the Durand Line, which is still straight through the settlement area of the Pashtuns runs and {{about a third of}} Afghanistan to British India annexing.|$|E

5000|$|The series tells that, {{far back}} in prehistory, when the first primeval Vogons crawled out of the sea, {{evolution}} gave up on them. Through sheer obstinacy, though, the Vogons survived (partly by adapting a misplaced, badly malformed, and dyspeptic liver into a brain). As the radio show says: [...] "What nature refused to give to them, they did without. Until their myriad anatomical deficiencies could be rectified with surgery. They then emigrated en masse to the MeagaBrantis star cluster (although the film has them staying on Vogsphere), the political hub of the galaxy. They banish the ruling philosophers to the tax office to lick stamps and within a <b>few</b> <b>short</b> Voge <b>years</b> took over pretty much all of the galactic civil service. where they form most of the Galactic bureaucracy, most notably in the Vogon Constructor Fleets (which, despite their name, patrol the galaxy demolishing planets).

Eystein nonetheless gained the affection of his people, and was highly regarded by the saga writers for his deeds. Eystein and Sigurd's reign became the longest joint rule in Norwegian history.|$|R

In November, General Wedemeyer, the commander of the China Theater, who also served as a military advisor to Chiang Kai-shek, warned the Nationalist leader to secure his hold on the vital provinces of northeastern China, before entering Manchuria. However, in order to do this, the Nationalists required an [...] "overwhelmingly superior" [...] force. As result, Nationalist troops who had been stationed in Hopeh and Shantung Provinces were sent into battle, leaving large areas of the said provinces unprotected from Communist guerrillas. It wasn't very long before the Communists had taken control of the areas previously held by the Nationalists. Shaw says that the [...] "Nationalist's premature Manchuria operation contained within it the seeds of Nationalist destruction, and they ripened in a <b>few</b> <b>short</b> and bloody <b>years</b> into total defeat." ...|$|R

According to Bill Mankin, in their dawning age rock festivals were important socio-cultural milestones: [...] "… {{it would not be}} an exaggeration to say that, over a <b>few</b> <b>short</b> <b>years,</b> rock festivals played a unique, significant – and underappreciated – role in fueling the countercultural shift that swept not only America but many other countries [...] It seems fitting… {{that one of the most}} enduring labels for the entire generation of that era was derived from a rock festival: the ‘Woodstock Generation’." ...|$|E

This phenomenon, known as dual screening, has caused some concern amongst marketers and advertisers, who believed that this behaviour was having an overall negative impact on consumer engagement with television. This chapter attempts to address some of these concerns by providing evidence obtained from the neurosciences and from a case study. The evidence we present in this chapter demonstrates the opposite effect, whereby social media can actually be used to enhance viewer engagement...|$|R

25|$|Most {{scholars}} {{believe that}} Brahmi was likely derived from or {{influenced by a}} Semitic script model, with Aramaic being a leading candidate.

Virtually all authors accept that regardless of the origins, the degree of Indian development of the Brahmi script in both the graphic form and the structure has been extensive. It is also widely accepted that theories about the grammar of the Vedic language probably had a strong influence on this development. Some authors – both Western and Indian – suggest that Brahmi was borrowed or inspired by a Semitic script, invented in a <b>short</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> during the reign of Ashoka and then used widely for Ashokan inscriptions.
