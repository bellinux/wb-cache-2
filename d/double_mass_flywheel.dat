The nonlinearities of stiffness are investigated, deriving a nonlinear model to describe the rotational speed-dependent stiffness. In addition, Bouc–Wen model is used to model the hysteretic frictional torque. Thus, the nonlinear 2 -degree-of-freedom system of this dual <b>mass</b> <b>flywheel</b> is set up. Then, the Levenberg–Marquardt method is adopted for the parameter estimation of the frictional torque.

40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines produce a fluctuating torque due to discrete pistons combustion, {{as well as}} induced inertial imbalance of the reciprocating pistons. In standard operating conditions, the resulting torsional oscillations of the crankshaft are transferred to the gearbox, leading {{to a number of}} comfort problems. Rattle noise is one of these problems and it is caused by impulsive forces caused by clearances across the driveline and especially in the gearbox. In order to prevent rattle, dual <b>mass</b> <b>flywheels</b> may be used to reduce torsional oscillations in automotive powertrains. The present paper presents a 3 D nonlinear dynamic model of an automotive dual <b>mass</b> <b>flywheel.</b> The model is made of primary and secondary masses and the arc springs between them. Centrifugal effects and redirection forces acting on the springs as well as nonlinear contact forces due to stoppers and flanges bounding spring motion are accounted for. Moreover, friction occurring in seals and friction resulting from the spring radial forces are included. The developed dual <b>mass</b> <b>flywheel</b> model is included into a multi-body model of the vehicle powertrain to assess the effect of its main parameters on the driveline behaviour (e. g. modes of vibration, radial forces) ...|$|R

40|$|Heavy duty {{trucks are}} faced with strict {{requirements}} regarding exhaust emissions and fuel efficiency. The demands are achieved through downsizing and downspeeding. This introduces torsional vibrations in the powertrain which, if not dealt with, will decrease life and comfort. One solution that deals with these vibrations is the Dual <b>Mass</b> <b>Flywheel</b> that absorbs the vibrations. The goal of this thesis is to develop and verify different computational models of a Dual <b>Mass</b> <b>Flywheel</b> and in particular study how the friction between the arc-spring and the primary ywheel affects the system. Modelling is done in Python using the Newmark- method combined with Newton's method for numerical simulations. The same model is also created in AVL Excite for verification. The friction between the arc-spring and the primary flywheel channel is modelled using the Coulomb friction model or an inverse tangent function. It has been verified that the two computational models give similar results. A method to approximate Coulomb friction has been developed {{in order to make}} the computational model more stable. The friction depends on both spring compression and centripetal force due to the rotation of the Dual <b>Mass</b> <b>Flywheel.</b> For a truck's operating speed the spring compression is the largest factor to frictional losses with current selection of geometrical and structural parameters. The results show that with low friction and low viscous damping resonance is not a significant problem even if it occurs at low engine speed. A study about the number of masses needed to solve the friction model have been performed. It is concluded that the friction moment has not converged using five spring masses. A method of achieving accurate results with few masses is presented. For a final conclusion about the dynamics of the Dual <b>Mass</b> <b>Flywheel,</b> the developed computational models need to be validated using experimental data. Modifications of geometrical and structural parameters should be done to fit the experiments...|$|R

40|$|The damping {{characteristics}} of the traditional dual <b>mass</b> <b>flywheel</b> (DMF) cannot be changed and can only meet one of the damping requirements. Given that the traditional DMF cannot avoid the resonance interval in start/stop conditions, it tends to generate high-resonance amplitude, which reduces the lifetime of a vehicle’s parts and leads to vehicle vibration and noise. The {{problems associated with the}} traditional DMF can be solved through the magnetorheological fluid dual <b>mass</b> <b>flywheel</b> (MRF-DMF), which was designed in this study with adjustable damping performance under different conditions. The MRF-DMF is designed based on the rheological behavior of the magnetorheological fluid (MRF), which can be changed by magnetic field strength. The damping torque of the MRF-DMF, which is generated by the MRF effect, is derived in detail. Thus, the cosimulation between the drivetrain model built in AMESim and the control system model developed in Simulink is conducted. The controller of MRF-DMF is developed, after which the torsional vibration control test of drivetrain is carried out. The cosimulation and test results indicate that MRF-DMF with the controller effectively isolates torque fluctuation of the engine in the driving condition and exhibits high performance in suppressing the resonance amplitude in the start/stop conditions...|$|R

40|$|In the {{development}} and application of highly dynamic mechanical systems, major problems can arise from usually unwanted accompanying processes, such as torsional vibrations. The internal combustion engine is a typical dynamic system with a high probability of fracture of a system {{part due to the}} effects of torsional vibrations.

Today, a relevant part of the driveability process optimisation is realised by means of track tests, which require a considerable effort due {{to the number of}} parameters (such as stiffness and damping components) affecting this behaviour. The drawback of this approach is that it is carried on at a stage when a design iteration becomes very expensive in terms of time and cost. The objective of this work is to propose a light and accurate tool to represent the relevant quantities involved in the driveability analysis, and to understand which are the main vehicle parameters that influence the torsional vibrations transmitted to the driver.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a conference paper. Torsional {{oscillations}} {{generated by the}} internal combustion engine induce various NVH phenomena in the drivetrain system, one being transmission rattle. Palliatives devices such as the clutch predampers or dual <b>mass</b> <b>flywheel</b> have been used to mitigate these NVH phenomena. However, usually these devices are effective over a limited range of frequencies, and not so for broadband transient phenomenon, such as any impulsive actions. This paper considers the Targeted Energy Transfer (TET) method to mitigate torsional vibrations in automotive powertrains. TET is a concept which attempts to direct the mechanical (vibration) energy (in a nearly irreversible manner) from a source (primary system) to a strongly nonlinear attachment (Nonlinear Energy Sink – NES), where it is absorbed, redistributed and/or dissipated. In contrast to the classical powertrain palliative methods, NES should be capable of operating over a broader band of frequencies (with the additional aim of being lightweight and compact). Although the TET concept has been extensively studied for translational systems, there is a dearth of studies for rotational (torsional) ones. In the present work, preliminary parametric studies are performed on a reduced automotive powertrain model, incorporating a NES attachment. The NES parameters, including nonlinear stiffness, viscous linear damping and inertia are varied in order to determine NES effects on engine order (EO) vibration...|$|R
