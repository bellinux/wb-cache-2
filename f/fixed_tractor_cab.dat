A space too narrow is extremely dangerous in case of overturning, for the collisions with the internal parts of the cab, and it can favour unintentional use of the commands with consequences on the behaviour of the vehicle. This paper is focused on experimental analysis of the internal dimension of <b>tractor</b> <b>cabs.</b> The main goal is to verify the respect of “the least overall dimensions” of the driver (according to UNI EN ISO 3411 standard), calculated on the biggest driver size, corresponding to the internal cab surface with no visible deformation.

As a result of these findings, recommendations will be made concerning areas of needed future research. Finally, a prototype design of an air curtain tractor will be proposed. The study concludes that the application of an air curtain for a tractor to protect the operator appears feasible. It will deflect winds of up to 20 mph from the operator. Based on previous findings, the determined design air curtain velocities are more than enough to keep rain, dust, insects, etc. from penetrating the curtain. It will not reduce tractor noise, but if a suitable fan system can be designed, the air curtain will at least not increase the existing noise levels. It is evident that more research is needed.

40|$|An optimal thermal {{climate in}} a vehicle is an {{important}} determinant factor for the driver's health, performance and comfort A poor climate and its effects upon the driver may endanger traffic safety [4]. In the confmed space of a <b>tractor</b> <b>cab</b> the thermal environment becomes very complex. Driver sits close to walls and windows. Glass windows are large and poorly insulated. Radiative heat exchange caused by cold or solar load may locally be excessive. HVAC-systems are normally powerful to compensate for poor insulation and considerable temperature gradients may build up. In addition, air velocities may be locally very high. The thermal impact on the driver {{is not easy to}} evaluate. Spot measurements are difficult to interprete and most climate indices only account for the avernge or whole body effect of the thermal load. This is not sufficient, since man may feel thermoneutral but still suffer severely from local thermal disturbances and asymmetries.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the airborne noise reduction of agricultural <b>tractor</b> <b>cabs.</b> The characteristics of the noise radiated from a non-cab-equipped tractor have been evaluated and used in conjunction with the classical theories of airborne sound transmission loss to predict the airborne noise reductions of <b>tractor</b> <b>cabs.</b> An experimental cab has beep constructed and used to evaluate these predictions. The theoretical and experimental airborne noise reductions do not show a good agreement. This {{has been shown to be}} due to two ressons. Firstly, there are anomalies in the classical airborne sound transmission loss theory whereby the theoretical and experimental sound transmission loss spectra do not show good agreement. Secondly, one-dimensional standing wave resonances in the cab cavity have been shown to give rise to an irregular plateau in the experimental airborne noise reduction spectra. Anomalies have been shown to exist between airborne sound transmission loss theory and reverberant room transmission loss measurements. These have arisen because the theory has not hitherto considered panel flexure. Modifications have been introduced which take account of panel flexure and these show that the dependence of classical theory on the angle of incident excitation is false and angular dependence occurs on the transmitted side of the panel, giving rise to a coincidence effect on the transmitted side which is independent of the angle of incidence. These modifications give rise to complete qualitative explanation of the shape of empirical airborne sound transmission loss spectra. Quantitative modifications have not been introduced because of lack of information regarding the angular nature of the transmitted waves...|$|R

40|$|In this report, we {{describe}} {{the implementation of the}} virtual bumper collision avoidance algorithm for highway vehicles. We describe the results from a series of experiments using the virtual bumper collision avoidance algorithm implemented on a Navistar <b>tractor</b> <b>cab.</b> The virtual bumper combines longitudinal and lateral collision avoidance capabilities to control a vehicle in normal and emergency situations. A programmable boundary, the virtual bumper, defines a personal space around the host vehicle. A radar and a laser range sensor were used to sense the location of vehicles in the region in front of the truck. Incursions into the personal space by target vehicles impose a virtual ‘force’ on the host, which in turn modifies the vehicle’s trajectory in order to avoid collisions with objects in the field of view. The virtual bumper longitudinal controller was tested under several driving situations and at several speeds. The experiments included several scenarios: Adaptive Cruise Control, the truck performing a critical stop when the target vehicle ahead is stationary, and situations in which the target suddenly slows down and speeds up and others which simulate stop and go traffic. Results from the virtual bumper longitudinal experiments were favorable. The algorithm demonstrated robustness to sensor noise and the ability to maintain a safe headway for both normal and emergency driving scenarios. We are presently improving the sensing technology and incorporating a road database which contains roadside features in order to greatly reduce, if not eliminate, false target detection.
