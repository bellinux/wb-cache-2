25|$|The general {{appearance}} of the Sheltie {{is that of a}} miniature Rough Collie. They are a small, double coated, working dog, agile and sturdy. Blue merle Shelties may have blue eyes or one brown and one blue eye, but all others have dark colored eyes. Their expression should be that of alertness with a gentle and sometimes reserved nature. They are often very good with children. They carry their tail <b>down</b> <b>low,</b> only lifted when alert and never carried over the back. They are an intensely loyal breed, sometimes reserved with strangers but should not be shy or showing timidness as per the AKC breed standard.|$|E

Writers and Producers The <b>Down</b> <b>Low</b> Concept had named the dog after three infamous and controversial New Zealand murder cases, due to the character of Will's father, and the original owner of the dog being a high court judge. The dog's name referred to convicted multiple murderers Mark Lundy, Scott Watson and David Bain. Bain was later acquitted after spending 13 years in jail following numerous appeals from Karam resulting in his eventual release from prison in 2009.|$|E

25|$|Gunpowder smoke {{added to}} a blanket of fog soon after the battle began. This smoke and fog made it nearly {{impossible}} for the opposing forces {{to see each other}} except by crouching <b>down</b> <b>low.</b> This served to help the defenders more since they were mainly lying behind their works and not attempting to get to them through the mud as the Confederate attackers were attempting to do. They also could simply fire into a narrow area where the Confederates had to attack and achieve effective results. The mud and standing water prevented cavalry and artillery from participating much in the battle. In fact, the Confederates lost three artillery pieces to a charge by the 2nd Kansas Colored Infantry and the 29th Iowa Infantry regiments from their fortified positions.|$|E
25|$|In game five, four {{goals were}} {{scored in the}} first 5:06 of the game. Brent Burns started the scoring at 1:04 {{slipping}} it past the Penguins goaltender on the right post after receiving a pass from Melker Karlsson. For the Sharks, it was their first lead in the Finals during regulation. At 2:53, the Sharks scored their second goal; this time Logan Couture scored the goal, deflecting a shot by Justin Braun. Less than two minutes later, Sharks forward Dainius Zubrus got called for a delay of game after shooting the puck over the glass. On the ensuing power play, Evgeni Malkin's shot got deflected off Braun's skate, cutting the deficit to 2–1. Twenty-two seconds later, Brenden Dillon gave away the puck to Nick Bonino who shot it on goal then getting deflected in by Carl Hagelin. In {{the middle of the}} first period on the power play, the Penguins shot once on the crossbar and Phil Kessel's shot went off both posts but stayed out. Later in the period, Dillon passed <b>down</b> <b>low</b> for Couture who sauced a backhand pass for Karlsson's goal to regain the lead for the Sharks. The Sharks then played defensively throughout the second and third period with goaltender Martin Jones stopping all 31 shots. Joe Pavelski provided an empty-net goal to force a sixth game.|$|E

Spears sings about dancing and being in the {{spotlight}} in lyrics such as [...] "Make them other chicks so mad / I'm 'bout to shake my ass / Watch that boy". During the bridge, her vocals are pitched <b>down</b> <b>low,</b> making her sound masculine.

500|$|It was Jones who {{ultimately}} played {{most of the}} bass parts during the Bollocks recordings; Howard calls his rudimentary, rumbling approach the [...] "explosive missing ingredient" [...] of the Sex Pistols' sound. Vicious's bass is reportedly present on one track that appeared on the original album release, [...] "Bodies". Jones recalls, [...] "He played his farty old bass part and we just let him do it. When he left I dubbed another part on, leaving Sid's <b>down</b> <b>low.</b> I {{think it might be}} barely audible on the track." [...] Following [...] "God Save the Queen", two more singles were released: [...] "Pretty Vacant" [...] (largely written by Matlock) on 1 July and from the Bollocks sessions, [...] "Holidays in the Sun" [...] on 14 October. Each was a Top Ten hit.|$|E
500|$|Along with [...] "Brand New Day", [...] "Everyone" [...] and [...] "Glad Tidings" [...] form {{a closing}} trio of songs {{permeated}} by what John Tobler called [...] "a celebratory air, bordering on spiritual joy". Labes opened [...] "Everyone" [...] by playing a clavinet figure in [...] time. A flute comes in, playing the melody after Morrison has sung four lines, with Schroer playing the harmony underneath on soprano saxophone. Although Morrison says {{the song is}} just a song of hope, Hinton says its lyrics suggest a more troubled meaning, as [...] 1969 was {{the year in which}} The Troubles broke out in Belfast. The final track, [...] "Glad Tidings", has a bouncy beat but the lyrics, like [...] "Into the Mystic", remain largely impenetrable, according to Hinton. In his opinion, [...] "the opening line and closing line, 'and they'll lay you <b>down</b> <b>low</b> and easy', could be either about murder or an act of love." [...] In Hage's opinion, [...] "'Glad Tidings' was a premonition of the future, as for the next four decades, Morrison would continue to use a song here and there to vent about the evils of the music industry and the world of celebrity." ...|$|E
500|$|The Vulcans were {{intended}} to be equipped with the American Skybolt Air Launched Ballistic Missile to replace the Blue Steel, with Vulcan B.2s carrying two Skybolts under the wings; the last 28 B.2s were modified on the production line to fit pylons to carry the Skybolt. A B.3 variant with increased wingspan to carry up to six Skybolts was proposed in 1960. When the Skybolt missile system was cancelled by U.S. President John F. Kennedy {{on the recommendation of}} his Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara in 1962, Blue Steel was retained. To supplement it until the Royal Navy took on the deterrent role with Polaris ICBM-equipped submarines, the Vulcan bombers adopted a new mission profile of flying high during clear transit, dropping <b>down</b> <b>low</b> to avoid enemy defences on approach, and deploying a parachute-retarded bomb, the WE.177B. However, since the aircraft had been designed for high-altitude flight, at low altitudes it could not exceed 350 knots. RAF Air Vice Marshal Ron Dick, a former Vulcan pilot, said [...] "it is [...] questionable whether it could have been effective flying at low level in a war against ... the Soviet Union." ...|$|E

500|$|Keith Caufield of Billboard {{noted the}} song [...] "doesn't take itself too seriously. Halfway through the number, the luckiest rapper in the world, Sabi, appears, inexplicably rhyming 'sweatin' you' with 'vegetables'," [...] while Digital Spy's Robert Copsey {{considered}} it [...] "self-assured". The A.V. Clubs Genevieve Koski commented that [...] "inane lyrical premises like those" [...] on the song [...] "are salvaged by the mightiest of hooks, pummeling the listener into lobotomized musical escapism". David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound said both [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] and [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] "brings Dirty Vegas memories, plus phoning in that Far East Movement 'Like a G6' backing track {{would have been}} put to better use with Spears' producers". Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times noted Spears [...] "drags her <b>down</b> <b>low</b> as if she's Rihanna" [...] in the song. MTV writer Eliot Glazer said that, [...] "even as a mom with two kids, Britney still manages to ooze sex appeal in [...] "Beautiful," [...] cementing her place as the world's number one MILF". Hannah Rishel of The Daily Collegian said [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] was [...] "possibly [...] favorite song on the album", commenting that [...] "it's cheesy and ridiculous, but Spears makes it work in the song". Following the release of Femme Fatale, [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] reached number forty-one on South Korea's Gaon International Chart, after selling 7,500 digital units of the song alone. The song also appeared on Billboards Dance/Electronic Digital Songs chart on the week of April 23, 2011.|$|E
500|$|In {{an early}} promotional interview, Nas {{claimed that the}} name [...] "Illmatic" [...] (meaning [...] "beyond ill" [...] or [...] "the ultimate") was a {{reference}} to his incarcerated Queensbridge friend, Illmatic Ice.

[...] At {{the time of its}} recording, expectations in the hip hop scene were high for Illmatic.

[...] AZ recounted recording on the album, [...] "I got on Nas' album and did the 'Life's a Bitch' song, but even then I thought I was terrible on it, to be honest. But once people started hearing that and liking it, that's what built my confidence. I thought, 'OK, I can probably do this.' That record was everything. To be the only person featured on Illmatic when Nas {{is considered one of the}} top men in New York at that time, one of the freshest new artists, that was big."
