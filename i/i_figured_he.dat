After racing in fifth place he moved up to second on the final turn and stayed on strongly in the straight to win by a nose and a neck from Trail City and Rob 'n Gin. After the race the Gainsborough Farm manager Allen Kershaw said [...] "The old man's amazing, isn't he?

Mraz told Artist Direct: [...] "I met him at coffee shop gigs, open mic nights and songwriter nights. He and his wife would play and sing' they are adorable. I invited him to my house to help me change out a toilet, since <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>he</b> would know. He did and brought his guitar over. We change the toilet and he played his guitar. He had all these ideas and riffs that he has been playing for 35 years. He has never had an outlet. I am almost 35, so some of those ideas came into existing same time I was being conceived." ...|$|E

[...] Familiar with editor and chief writer Stan Lee's Marvel work, and feeling them [...] "the most vital comics around", Thomas [...] "just sat down one night at the hotel and - I wrote him a letter! Not applying for a job or anything so mundane as that - I just said that I admired his work, and would like to buy him a drink some time. <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>he</b> just might remember me from Alter Ego."

5000|$|A {{number of}} names were {{rumored to be}} in {{contention}} for the Raiders head coaching job, from Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi to Lou Agase, former coach of the Canadian Football League Toronto Argonauts. On January 1, 1963, Davis met with Valley and the other Raiders general partner, Ed McGah. According to witnesses present at the negotiations, Davis {{did not have a}} high opinion of Valley and McGah, indicating during their absence {{that they did not know}} the right questions to ask. They offered him a one-year contract as head coach. He declined, insisting on a multiyear deal as both head coach and general manager, with complete control over football operations. They settled on three years at a salary of $20,000 per annum. According to Davis biographer Ira Simmons, the date that Davis came to Oakland, January 18, 1963, [...] "was probably one of the three or four most important dates in AFL history. Maybe NFL history too." [...] Valley later stated, [...] "we needed someone who wanted to win so badly, he would do anything. Everywhere I went, people told me what a son of a bitch Al Davis was, so <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>he</b> must be doing something right." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The character's {{evolution}} {{over the}} season hasn't really surprised me,' he continues. 'I've been excited {{about what the}} writers have written for him, but it wasn't really surprising. I figured {{that was the only}} way he could go, which was to become a little bit lighter. Once in a while I kind of like it that he thinks he's got a place in life, that this is his journey and he's going to follow that journey, no questions asked. He's going to question everything else and defy all authority. I kind of like that, because even when he doesn't want to do something, <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>he</b> would go against his heart and do what he felt he was meant to do. In one sense it's admirable, but in another it's kind of ignorant and stupid. I kind of like that loyalty on his part, but that's slowly going to be broken down with the relationship with Maria and Max and Isabel, which will force him to kind of embrace the human side of life more. That's going to be the real ultimate struggle for him. I don't think you can ride the fence on that one; you're going to have to fully embrace your alienhood or kind of go the other way, and I don't think, mentally for the health of the character, that he can just stay with his alienhood. Overall, I think a choice will have to be made and that's what he'll struggle with." [...] Brendan Fehr, from [...] "Roswell: Brendan Fehr" [...] by Edward Gross ...|$|E

Determined to know the {{location}} of a 14-year-old girl that Davis has kidnapped and buried alive, Callahan then presses his foot onto Davis' leg wound, ignoring Davis's pleas for a doctor and a lawyer until Davis gives up the location of the kidnapped girl. Callahan is later informed by the District Attorney that because Callahan kicked in the door of Davis's residence without a warrant, and because Davis's confession of the girl's location was made under the duress of torture, the evidence against him is inadmissible, and Davis has been released without charges filed against him. Callahan explains his outlook to the Mayor of San Francisco, who asks how Callahan ascertains that a man he had shot was intending to commit rape; the inspector responds, [...] "When a naked man is chasing a woman through an alley with a butcher knife and a hard-on, <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> <b>he</b> isn't out collecting for the Red Cross." ...|$|R

[...] Speaking of Milton Brown and himself—working with popular songs done by Jimmie Davis, the Skillet Lickers, Jimmie Rodgers, songs he had learned from his father and others—Wills said, [...] "We'd...pull these tunes down an set 'em in a dance category. ...They wouldn't be a runaway...and just lay a real beat behind it an' the people would began to really like it. ...It was nobody intended to start anything in the world.

I’d Google “How {{to break out of}} prison.” So, that’s exactly what I did. I went on and Googled “How to break out of prison,” “How to break into a car,” and found these fascinating things, and I just used them. <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> that’s what <b>he</b> would do. I also knew I would fail spectacularly, at least at first. But then I would continue. And I’d get the shit beat out of me, and I would trust the wrong people, and I would do the wrong things. I’d start to feel really good about myself, that I’d figured the whole thing out, and then something would go wrong. I would just keep going until I either was caught or we got out or something happened. That’s what he does. So, I just tried to make him an everyman. I loved the fact that this guy was also an English teacher, so he was a romantic. He was talking about Don Quixote. He’s got this whole romanticized vision of how you sacrifice yourself for a woman, how you go about something like this. It’s terribly romanticized and so completely impractical.|$|R
40|$|Travelling features: Multiple sources, {{multiple}} destinations The formal {{features that}} are traditionally taken to define grammatical categories can be exchanged between categories. This implies that grammatical categories at best represent clusters of recurrently, but neither exclusively nor consistently, co-occurring features (in line with Croft 2001; Bickel 2010; De Smet 2010). The reason behind the promiscuous behaviour of formal features is that diachronically, the categories characterized by these features often derive from multiple source constructions (see Van de Velde et al. 2013). In this paper, we present two case studies that demonstrate feature exchange between historically distinct, but related categories. The first case study is on Dutch auxiliaries. Like in English, Dutch auxiliaries fall into two categories, depending on whether they take the ‘long’ infinitive (with te, cognate of English to) (1) or the bare infinitive (2). (1) 	hij lijkt *(te) werken (‘he seems to work’) (2) 	hij mag (*te) werken (‘he may work’) However, both categories contaminated each other. These contamination effects are strongest in constructions that distinguish both categories of auxiliaries from ordinary verbs, such as the infinitivus-pro-participium (IPP) (Schmid 2005). Thus, the bare infinitive construction has extended to auxiliaries traditionally patterning with the te-infinitive, starting in the IPP construction and later extending to new contexts, more specifically those contexts that superficially resemble IPP. The process can be shown to display lexical diffusion effects. The extension is illustrated in (3) -(4) with durative-aspectual auxiliary zitten (Haeseryn et al. 1997 : 970). (3) 	Hij zit de hele dag *(te) werken (‘he is working all day’) [no IPP] (4) 	Hij heeft de hele dag zitten (te) werken (‘he has been working all day’) [IPP] (5) 	omdat ze de hele dag zitten (te) werken (‘they have been working all day’) [no IPP, but superficially similar] The second case study deals with English quantifiers. As a lot grammaticalized and entered the category of quantifiers (Brems 2003; Traugott 2008), the behaviour of core members like some, many or a few also changed. Specifically, as a quantifier, a lot retained the possibility of combining with the degree modifier quite – a feature carried over from its historical origins as a noun phrase. Subsequently, quite also spread to a few and (marginally) some and many. In other words, a distributional feature travelled from nouns to quantifiers. This is illustrated in (6) -(8). (6) 	The fugitive had run quite a distance (1862, COHA) (7) 	We saw {{quite a lot of}} folks from East Wellmouth (1869, COHA) (8) 	so <b>I</b> <b>figures</b> <b>he's</b> been there quite some time.
