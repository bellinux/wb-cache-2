5|$|Despite {{the very}} <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> 11,970 yen (about 100 US dollars), Dragon Quest VI sold 3.2 {{million copies in}} Japan, of which 2.5 million were sold in December alone, {{resulting}} in it becoming the best selling game of 1995. In 2010, Dragon Quest VI for the Nintendo DS sold almost a million copies in Japan in its first week. The game sold over 1.2 million copies by March 2010.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, the <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> nickel {{has led to}} some {{replacement}} of the metal in coins around the world. Coins still made with nickel alloys include one- and two-euro coins, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢ and 50¢ U.S. coins, and 20p, 50p, £1 and £2 UK coins. Nickel-alloy in 5p and 10p UK coins was replaced with nickel-plated steel began in 2012, causing allergy problems for some people and public controversy.|$|E
5|$|WebObjects {{failed to}} achieve wide {{popularity}} {{partly because of the}} initial <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> US$50,000, but it remains the first and most prominent early example of a web application server that enabled dynamic page generation based on user interactions as opposed to static content.

5|$|Although 247Bk is {{the most}} stable isotope of berkelium, its {{production}} in nuclear reactors is very inefficient due to the long half-life of its potential progenitor curium-247, which does not allow it sufficient time to beta decay before capturing another neutron. Thus, 249Bk {{is the most}} accessible isotope of berkelium, which still, is available only in small quantities (only 0.66grams have been produced in the US over the period 1967–1983) at a <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> the order 185 USD per microgram.|$|E
5|$|Curium is {{produced}} in small quantities in nuclear reactors, and by now only kilograms of it have been accumulated for the 242Cm and 244Cm and grams or even milligrams for heavier isotopes. This explains the <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> curium, which has been quoted at 160–185 USD per milligram, with a more recent estimate at 2,000 USD/g for 242Cm and 170 USD/g for 244Cm. In nuclear reactors, curium is formed from 238U {{in a series of}} nuclear reactions. In the first chain, 238U captures a neutron and converts into 239U, which via β− decay transforms into 239Np and 239Pu.|$|E
5|$|NeXT later {{released}} {{much of the}} NeXTSTEP {{system as}} a programming environment standard called OpenStep. NeXT withdrew from the hardware business in 1993 to concentrate on marketing OPENSTEP for Mach, its own OpenStep implementation, for several OEMs. NeXT also developed WebObjects, {{one of the first}} enterprise Web application frameworks. WebObjects never became very popular because of its initial <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> $50,000, but it remains a prominent early example of a Web server based on dynamic page generation rather than on static content.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} few years Bryan used his {{influence}} to rename, in memory of his homeland, both the town and the river, much to the disgust of Lyttleton. It was reported in 1831 newspapers that the road from Launceston to Carrick had been opened. The path of the road was announced in April 1831, and it was opened for public traffic in June. The State Government sold town allotments in late 1838, obtaining what was noted as a <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> £45 (A$8,100 in 2005) per acre.|$|E
5|$|Robert {{went on to}} rent further {{land around}} the north of Plas Mawr. The land {{at the south end}} of the burgage, however, facing onto the High Street, belonged to a Robert Laythwood, who had a house there. Wynne {{purchased}} this in 1585, probably for the relatively <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> £40, and demolished it to enable the final phase of development, using the space to build a gatehouse that formed the new entrance to Plas Mawr. Further small pieces of land were bought on the north-west side of the house and converted into an ornamental garden, bringing the total cost of the land to around £300. The result was the grandest Elizabethan town house in Wales at the time.|$|E
5|$|The AirTrain JFK {{was mostly}} routed along {{existing}} rights-of-way, but three commercial properties, including {{a gas station}} and a vacant building, were seized and demolished {{to make way for}} the AirTrain alignment. Members of the New York City Planning Commission approved the condemnation of several buildings along the route in May 1999, but voiced concerns about the logistics of the project. The commission's concerns included the projected <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> the tickets; ridership demand; and unwieldy transfers at Jamaica.|$|E

The <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> coal {{at the end of the}} 19th century persuaded the newly created Fine Cotton Spinners and Doublers Association to mitigate the effects on its members by purchasing the colliery in 1900, thus ensuring a cheap supply of fuel for their steam-powered mills.|$|E
5|$|The initial vigour and {{excitement}} {{he brought to}} the job began to fade as administration, commuting and office life became tedious. At {{the same time as}} Wilde's interest flagged, the publishers became concerned anew about circulation: sales, at the relatively <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> one shilling, remained low. Increasingly sending instructions to the magazine by letter, he began a new period of creative work and his own column appeared less regularly. In October 1889, Wilde had finally found his voice in prose and, {{at the end of the}} second volume, Wilde left The Woman's World. The magazine outlasted him by one issue.|$|E
5|$|The {{major change}} in {{agriculture}} in Kerala occurred in the 1970s when production of rice fell due to increased availability of rice all over India and decreased availability of labour. Consequently, investment in rice production decreased and {{a major portion of}} the land shifted to the cultivation of perennial tree crops and seasonal crops. Profitability of crops fell due to a shortage of farm labour, the <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> land, and the uneconomic size of operational holdings.|$|E

5|$|Americium {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1944 {{by the group}} of Glenn T. Seaborg from Berkeley, California, at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago, {{a part of the}} Manhattan Project. Although it is the third element in the transuranic series, it was discovered fourth, after the heavier curium. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most americium is produced by uranium or plutonium being bombarded with neutrons in nuclear reactors – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100grams of americium. It is widely used in commercial ionization chamber smoke detectors, as well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges. Several unusual applications, such as nuclear batteries or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion, have been proposed for the isotope 242mAm, but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> this nuclear isomer.|$|E
5|$|As {{the sixth}} {{installment}} to the Dragon Quest series, the graphics and gameplay remain {{close to the}} other games, with minor additions and upgrades. The graphics were vastly improved from , which was also for the SNES, but had rather unimpressive graphics due to being an early game on the console. Navigation remains largely unchanged from the previous games and the turn-based battles are still in first-person. The class system from Dragon Quest III returns, with minor adjustments. The large cartridge ROM used by the game resulted in an extremely <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> 11,970 yen (about 137 dollars), Dragon Quest VI sold 3.2 million copies in Japan, becoming the best selling game of 1995. The DS version sold an additional one million copies by March 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 1805 or 1806 {{the last}} bull-baiting {{in the town}} took place. On 7 July 1839, a severe fire {{destroyed}} many houses in Cullompton. About {{two thirds of the}} town burnt with 145 houses and other buildings being destroyed. A subscription for rebuilding was set and donations of £5 were made by Barne and Son, tanners of Tiverton, and Cullompton tanners Mortimore and Selwood. In 1847 a riot occurred in the town due to the <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> wheat. Three houses were attacked, including one in Pound Square belonging to Mr Selwood, the owner of a local tannery and also a maltster. He was accused of speculatively buying 2000 bushels of corn and when his house was attacked, almost all the windows were broken and his furniture was also damaged.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{comparative}} analysis of gross margins in 2006 and 2011, {{the economic impact}} of winter wheat production on farms in the Republic of Serbia was estimated. The subject of the analysis was variable costs for purchased seed, fertilizers, pesticides, and contract harvesting services. Based on the analysis of the gross margin for winter wheat, it was noted that the value of production (VP), total variable costs (TVC) and gross margin (GM) were significantly higher in 2011 than in 2006. In 2011, VP was higher due to a significantly higher yield and the <b>higher</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> winter wheat grain. In addition to <b>higher</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> all inputs, the increase in variable costs was mostly influenced by the <b>higher</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> fertilizer. Comparing the two time periods in winter wheat production, it was concluded that the value of GM in 2011 increased by 30 %...|$|R

5|$|Lander's Peak was an {{immediate}} success; twelve hundred people were invited for the exhibition, and almost a thousand showed up. Bierstadt was a shrewd self-promoter {{as well as a}} gifted artist, and this was the first of his paintings to be widely promoted with a single-picture exhibition, accompanied by a pamphlet, engravings and a tour. The painting, with its ten-foot width, was intended both for exhibition halls and the homes of America's emergent millionaire class. In 1865 it was purchased by British railway entrepreneur James McHenry for the (at the time) <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> $25,000. Bierstadt later bought it back, and gave or sold it to his brother Edward, before it was eventually acquired for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1907.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 October, a young woman struck a marching drum {{at the edge of}} a group of market-women who were infuriated by the chronic {{shortage}} and <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> bread. From their starting point in the markets of the eastern section of Paris then known as the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, the angry women forced a nearby church to toll its bells. Their numbers continued to grow and with restless energy the group began to march. More women from other nearby marketplaces joined in, many bearing kitchen blades and other makeshift weapons, as the tocsins rang from church towers throughout several districts. Driven by a variety of agitators, the mob converged on the Hôtel de Ville where they demanded not only bread, but arms. As more and more women – and men – arrived, the crowd outside the city hall reached between six and seven thousand, and perhaps as many as ten thousand.|$|E
5|$|Two drains were built, {{of which}} the most {{successful}} was the Swinefleet Warping Drain, pioneered by Ralph Creyke and T.H.S. Sotheron, and authorised by an Act of Parliament. Opened in 1821, poor-quality land was reclaimed for around forty years. The other scheme was Durham's Warping Drain, {{to the north of}} Thorne, which ran westwards to a sluice on the River Don. The drain was completed in 1856 by Makin Durham, but he failed to achieve much reclamation of the peat moors. He died in 1882, just as ideas to use the peat commercially began to replace the concept of attempting to make the moors suitable for agriculture. The change was brought about by an agricultural depression and the <b>high</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> straw for animal bedding.|$|E
