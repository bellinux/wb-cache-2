30|$|The {{application}} of end eccentricities at column ends changed the strain distribution along the column cross-section at the mid-height point, where tensile strain maybe developed based <b>on</b> the <b>end</b> eccentricity value {{as well as}} the curvature mode. For columns bent in single curvature modes, tensile strain could be developed at the mid-height section since this section is the maximum stressed section for the case of equal end eccentricities. While, for unequal end eccentricities, the maximum stressed section could be shifted based <b>on</b> the <b>end</b> eccentricities <b>combinations.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, for the columns bent in double curvature modes, the mid-height section could develop the lowest strain for the case of equal end eccentricities and higher values but not the maximum ones for the case of unequal end eccentricities.|$|R

40|$|AbstractEnd {{reflection}} {{phenomenon in}} a semi-infinitely long layered piezoelectric circular cylinder is constructed with modal {{data from a}} spectral decomposition of the differential operator governing its natural vibrations. These modal data consist of all propagating modes and edge vibrations and they constitute {{the basis for a}} wave function expansion of the reflection of waves arriving at the traction-free end of the cylinder. Without any other external stimulus, a passive reflection event occurs. This traction-free end condition is enforced at the Gaussian integration points over the <b>end</b> cross-section <b>on</b> the <b>combination</b> of incoming and reflected wave fields. Reflections due to monochromatic incoming axisymmetric (m= 0) and flexural (m= 1) waves are studied and two numerical examples are presented. For an incoming axisymmetric wave, there is a particular frequency that induces an end resonance, which is characterized by high (but finite) amplitudes of end displacements vis-a-vis those of neighboring (i. e., slightly different) frequencies. This phenomenon is illustrated in the two cylinder examples. It is possible to modify the passive reflection event by imposing some voltage distribution over the free end. For an oscillating end voltage that is out-of-phase with the incoming wave, it is possible to extract electrical energy from it, i. e., energy harvesting. Examples of such an oscillating voltage with a particular radial distribution are given, that illustrate the amount of extracted energy {{as a function of the}} frequency of the incident monochromatic wave...|$|R
