50|$|<b>Hamycin</b> is {{obtained}} from a strain of streptomyces bacteria growing in soil i.e., Streptomyces pimprina. This compound is being produced in India by Hindustan Antibiotics Limited, located at Pimpri, Pune, Maharashtra, India. It is similar to nystatin and it is more water-soluble.|$|E
50|$|Mandayam Jeersannidhi Thirumalachar (14 September 1914 - 21 April 1999) was an Indian mycologist, microbiologist, plant {{pathologist}} and the co-founder of Jeersannidhi-Anderson Institute, California. He {{was the head}} of R&D at Hindustan Antibiotics Limited and a professor at Banaras Hindu University as well as the Central College of Bangalore. He was known for the development of antifungal antibiotics such as <b>Hamycin,</b> Dermostatin, Aureofungin, MYc-4 and Tetraenenin and was an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to Medical Sciences in 1967.|$|E
5000|$|During {{his days}} at Hindustan Antibiotics Limited, Thirumalachar focused on medical {{mycology}} and plant disease control. [...] As {{the head of the}} research and development division, he led a team of scientists who developed a number antibiotic preparations, including Antiamoebin of Emericellopsis sp, an antimicrobial polypeptide which has reported use as a carrier, as a pore-forming peptaibol, as a de-worming agent, and as a yield-enhancing supplement in dairy and poultry industries. Antifungal antibiotics, such as <b>Hamycin,</b> Dermostatin, Aureofungin, MYc-4 and Tetraenenin are some of the other products developed by his team at Hindustan Antibiotics. At Wisconsin, he developed a set of chemicals, New chemotherapeutic agents for the control of plant and animal diseases, which has since been put to use as a product, Phyton-27, by Phyton Corporation. He documented his researches by way of several monographs and articles published in peer-reviewed journals and his work has been cited by a number of authors and researchers. The monographs and other edited books published by him include Ustilaginales of India, Revisions of and additions to Indian fungi : I, Revisions of and additions to Indian fungi : II, Revisions of and additions to Indian fungi : III, Check list of Cercospora species in India, Plant disease problems : proceedings of the First International Symposium on Plant Pathology, 27, 1966 - January 1, 1967, Studies on some stripe smuts of grasses in Wisconsin, Puccinia Droogensis Butler on Berberis Aristata and Tuberculina on Uromyces Hobsoni Vize. He also held a number of US patents which included Synthesis of pharmaceutical compositions with lactams and [...]beta.-lactams/oxo thia azabicyclo compounds, Microbial degradation of petroleum materials, Method, compound and composition for effecting degradation of crude petroleum and petroleum products in an environment,Process for the production of insulin by genetically transformed fungal cells, Process of producing <b>hamycin</b> antibiotic and product produced and N,N'Dibenzylethylenediamine-diacetylsalicylate, a novel chemotherapeutic agent for pain relief by external application, several of them for processes he developed jointly with his father and son. Many of the chemotherapeutants developed by him are in commercial use under various names such as Jai-Pro, MJN-1891 and Gopi-80. He also mentored many students and B. G. L. Swamy was one among them.|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{responses}} {{of patients with}} blastomycosis to treatment with <b>hamycin</b> have been variable. An explanation for this was sought {{in a series of}} studies in which in vitro and in vivo susceptibilities to <b>hamycin</b> of five strains of Blastomyces dermatitidis were compared. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of <b>hamycin</b> for the five strains indicated uniformly high levels of in vitro susceptibility (0. 008 to 0. 016 μg/ml). In vivo activity was measured in infected mice treated intraperitoneally for a period of 28 days with doses of the drug ranging from 0. 001 to 0. 030 mg per mouse. Significant differences in response to treatment among the five strains were noted (P 0. 030 mg per mouse per day. Further observations of infected mice after treatment revealed marked rates of relapsing infection, and several strains caused death. Persistent inapparent infections were also detected on culture of selected organs. Toxicity due to <b>hamycin</b> alone was not observed. These results suggest that variations in clinical responses to <b>hamycin</b> therapy in treatment of blastomycosis reflect differences in pathogenesis and host response in vivo to the infecting organism rather than differences in susceptibility of B. dermatitidis to <b>hamycin...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Hamycin,</b> a polyene antibiotic, now in {{extensive}} {{use in the}} treatment of candidiasis and otomycosis, is found to be remarkably effective in killing Leishmania donovani promastigotes in a liquid medium at a concentration of 0. 2 g/ml. The glucose stimulated respiration and the uptake of 2 -deoxy-D[U- 14 C] -glucose was inhibited in cells treated with the drug at a growth inhibitory concentration. An immediate release of isotopic glucose from preloaded cells could be demonstrated after exposure to <b>hamycin.</b> All the above effects could be effectively prevented in the presence of ergosterol. The primary site of action of <b>hamycin</b> on L. donovani promastigote cells appears to be membrane sterols that resu-i-t in the loss of the permeability barrier to small metabolites. The lower minimum inhibitory concentration of <b>hamycin</b> compared to other established drugs warrants further study in the context of increasing reports of clinical resistance to pentavalent antimonials...|$|E
40|$|Disks of beet {{root and}} potato tuber {{exhibited}} increased efflux of betacyanin, carbohydrates, and amino acids on treatment with the polyene antibiotics aureofungin [8065 -​ 41 -​ 6] and <b>hamycin</b> [1403 -​ 71 -​ 0]​. The effect of aureofungin was reversed by calcium [7440 -​ 70 -​ 2] ions {{in the case}} of beet root; but calcium ions did not antagonize the effect of <b>hamycin.</b> The effect of calcium ions against aureofungin was not obsd. in potato tuber disks. A combination of aureofungin or <b>hamycin</b> with EDTA [60 -​ 00 -​ 4] caused greater permeability of the membranes than the antibiotics (aureofungin or <b>hamycin)</b> alone, and this effect of the chelating agent was reversed by both calcium and magnesium [7439 -​ 95 -​ 4] ions.

40|$|Fourteen polyene {{antibiotics}} and six of their semisynthetic derivatives were compared for {{their effects on}} potassium (K+) leakage and lethality or hemolysis of either Saccharomyces cerevisiae or mouse erythrocytes. These polyene antibiotics fell into two groups. Group I antibiotics caused K+ leakage and cell death or hemolysis at the same concentrations of added polyene. In this group fungistatic and fungicidal levels were indistinguishable. Group I drugs included one triene (trienin); tetraenes (pimaricin and etruscomycin); pentaenes (filipin and chainin); one hexaene (dermostatin); and one polyene antibiotic with unknown chemical structure (lymphosarcin). Group II antibiotics caused considerable K+ leakage at low concentrations and cell death or hemolysis at high concentrations. The fungistatic levels were clearly separable from fungicidal. This group included the heptaenes (amphotericin B, candicidin, aureofungin A and B, <b>hamycin</b> A and B), and five of their semisynthetic derivatives (amphotericin B methyl ester, N-acetyl-amphotericin B, <b>hamycin</b> A and B methyl esters, and N-acetyl-candicidin). Nystatin, classified as a tetraene, and its derivative, N-acetyl nystatin, also were in this group...|$|E
40|$|A 36 -year-old female was {{admitted}} to hospital for debridement of chronically inflamed tendon sheaths and adjacent tissues near the left ankle. Despite antibiotic therapy and initial surgical interventions, the inflammation had progressed slowly over 16 months. Histopathological examination of excised tissues in September 1973 revealed a chronic granulomatous inflammation of tendon sheaths and muscle. Many branched hyphal segments, intercalary swollen cells, and a few conidia-like bodies were seen in sections, and also in KOH- and PAS-stained slides prepared from homogenized tissues. Culture of homogenized tissues yielded pure colonies of Scopulariopsis brevicaulis. Sensitivity tests were initially begun with amphotericin B, potassium iodide, and potassium tartrate (0 · 05 - 15 μg/ml of the phytone-yeast extract agar), and no inhibitory effect was observed. Subsequently, amphotericin B, antimony, 5 -fluorocytosine (5 -FC), griseofulvin, <b>hamycin,</b> and mycostatin were tested (25 - 300 μg/ml of the phytone-yeast extract agar). Of these chemicals, griseofulvin and <b>hamycin</b> proved to be most effective. Antimony and 5 -FC were ineffective, and mycostatin produced a negligible effect on growth.

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} <b>hamycin</b> is 5 to 10 times more active in vitro than amphotericin B against Cryptococcus neoformans, whereas 5 -fluorocytosine is approximately 15 times less active. Present studies are concerned with a comparison of these drugs in vivo. Three strains of C. neoformans which varied in both their virulence for mice and their susceptibilities to the antifungal agents were studied. Acute experimental infections were established in mice by using inocula containing approximately 4 × 106 cells. The mice were treated by gastric intubation for 28 days; daily dosages of the three drugs ranged from 12. 5 to 250 mg/kg. The polyenes were suspended in 5 % dimethyl sulfoxide, whereas 5 -fluorocytosine was suspended in saline. Amphotericin B was the most effective drug, with almost complete absence of toxic deaths in control mice and increased survival in mice infected {{with two of the}} three strains and treated with 25 mg/kg per day or more. 5 -Fluorocytosine was nontoxic but provided protection against only one strain. <b>Hamycin</b> was both the least effective and the most toxic compound, providing only slight protection at doses of 12. 5 or 25 mg/kg per day and causing toxic deaths in over 50 % of uninfected mice at doses above 25 mg/kg per day...|$|E

Since the antibiotic is absorbed when given orally and maintains prolonged therapeutic blood levels, protection studies {{were carried out}} in mice experimentally infected by the yeast phase of B. dermatitidis, noculated intravenously. Oral <b>hamycin</b> administered daily at a level of 20 mg. /kg, body weight for 20 days, the first treatment starting on the fourth day after inoculation, completely eliminated infection with B. dare,it/d/s, while in the controls there was 100 % infection and death of the mice from 40 th day onwards.

40|$|About 50 polyenic {{antifungal}} antibiotics {{produced by}} actinomycetes have been isolated and described. Among {{these are the}} most effective antimonilial agents so far known. These polyenes can be classified into four broad groups depending on the number of conjugated carbon-to-carbon double bonds that are present in their chromophores. Only some of the tetraenes (four conjugated double bonds), such as nystatin and pimaricin, and a few heptaenes (seven conjugated double bonds), such as amphotericin B, Trichomycin candicidin and <b>hamycin,</b> have found practical application in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by fungi. Nystatin and pimaricin show the least in vitro activity against fungi, while trichomycin and candicidin are the most active.

40|$|The {{antifungal}} {{activity of}} pyrrolnitrin, previously {{shown to be}} effective against superficial infections, was evaluated against experimental systemic mycoses. Pyrrolnitrin was inhibitory in vitro at < 0. 78 to 100 μg/ml to Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Sporotrichum schenckii, and Histoplasma capsulatum. Pyrrolnitrin activity was reduced about 90 % in sera. After multiple subcutaneous doses of pyrrolnitrin at 20 mg/kg, activity was recovered in mouse blood and urine as well as kidney, liver, and brain homogenates. Multiple daily doses (50 mg/kg) of this antibiotic were effective in reducing by 74 % the number of viable cells of C. albicans recovered from kidney homogenates. Multiple doses (15 mg/kg) resulted in a 74 % {{reduction in the number}} of C. neoformans from brain homogenates. Pyrrolnitrin was ineffective in reducing the recovery of B. dermatitidis or H. capsulatum from liver or spleen homogenates of infected mice.
