5|$|Celestial bodies {{interior}} to {{the orbit}} of Mercury have been hypothesized, and searched <b>for,</b> <b>for</b> centuries. The German astronomer Christoph Scheiner thought he had seen small bodies passing {{in front of the}} Sun in 1611, but these were later shown to be sunspots. In the 1850s, Urbain Le Verrier made detailed calculations of Mercury's orbit and found a small discrepancy in the planet's perihelion precession from predicted values. He postulated that the gravitational influence of a small planet or ring of asteroids within {{the orbit of}} Mercury would explain the deviation. Shortly afterward, an amateur astronomer named Edmond Lescarbault claimed to have seen Le Verrier's proposed planet transit the Sun. The new planet was quickly named Vulcan but was never seen again, and the anomalous behaviour of Mercury's orbit was explained by Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1915. The vulcanoids take their name from this hypothetical planet. What Lescarbault saw was probably another sunspot.|$|E

Instead, the script was re-written so that the character is said to be on leave, letting Chief of Staff Bill Tanner takes over the role as acting head of MI6 and briefing Bond alongside the Minister of Defence.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} David C. Large wrote that, {{like any}} public pronouncements, these bylaws {{did not tell}} the full story about HIAG's real goals. By investigating how these statutes were applied in practice, he was able to tease out what the organisation stood <b>for.</b> <b>For</b> example, HIAG claimed to represent the entire Waffen-SS membership, surviving and fallen, as well as their families: 500,000 in total. In reality, the organisation's rolls did not exceed 20,000. HIAG attained this number in the late 1950s, and held it until the early 1960s.|$|E

25|$|In earlier {{computers}} and video game systems, sound effects were typically produced using sound synthesis. In modern systems, {{the increases in}} storage capacity and playback quality has allowed sampled sound to be used. The modern systems also frequently utilize positional audio, often with hardware acceleration, and real-time audio post-processing, which can also be tied to the 3D graphics development. Based on the internal state of the game, multiple different calculations can be made. This will allow <b>for,</b> <b>for</b> example, realistic sound dampening, echoes and doppler effect.|$|E
25|$|Cinema first {{appeared}} in Greece in 1896, but the first actual cine-theatre was opened in 1907 in Athens.

Golfo (Γκόλφω), a well known traditional love story, is considered the first Greek feature film, although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this. In 1931 Orestis Laskos directed Daphnis and Chloe (Δάφνις και Χλόη), containing one of the first nude scene in the history of European cinema; it was also the first Greek movie which was played abroad.

Approximately £15,000,000 worth of diamonds were used. It was modelled on an 18th-century skull, but the only surviving human {{part of the original}} is the teeth. The asking price <b>for</b> <b>For</b> the Love of God was £50,000,000 ($100million or 75million euros).

The poster caused some furor—largely in the US—with The Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times edited out everything above the knee, while the Pittsburgh Press editors painted a pair of shorts over the legs.

25|$|Many file systems, {{including}} FAT, NTFS, and VMS systems, allow a {{filename extension}} {{that consists of}} one or more characters following the last period in the filename, dividing the filename into two parts: a base name or stem and an extension or suffix used by some applications to indicate the file type. Multiple output files created by an application use the same basename and various extensions. For example, a compiler might use the extension <b>FOR</b> <b>for</b> source input file (for Fortran code), OBJ for the object output and LST for the listing. Although there are some common extensions, they are arbitrary and a different application might use REL and RPT. On filesystems that do not segregate the extension, files will often have a longer extension such as html.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{guitar and}} {{electric}} bass players who perform concerts may use electronic tuners built into an effects pedal, often called a stomp box. These tuners have a rugged metal or heavy-duty plastic housing and a foot-operated switch to toggle between the tuner and a bypass mode. Professional guitarists may use {{a more expensive}} version of the LED tuner mounted in a rack-mount case with a larger range of LEDs for more accurate pitch display. Many models let the user select reference pitches other than A440. On many electronic tuners, the user can select a different note—useful <b>for,</b> <b>for</b> example, dropping a guitar's tuning to a lower pitch (e.g., Dropped tuning). Some models are adjustable standards other than A=440. This is useful to some Baroque musicians who play period instruments at lower reference pitches—such as A=435. Some higher-priced electronic tuners support tuning {{to a range of}} different temperaments—a feature useful to some guitarists and harpsichord players.|$|E
