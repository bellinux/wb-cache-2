50|$|Recently, {{physostigmine}} {{has been}} proposed as an antidote for intoxication with <b>gamma</b> <b>hydroxybutyrate</b> (GHB, a potent sedative-hypnotic agent that can cause loss of consciousness, loss of muscle control, and death). Physostigmine may counteract GHB by producing a nonspecific state of arousal. However, not enough scientific evidence shows physostigmine properly treats GHB toxicity. Furthermore, lower doses of GHB produce a stronger action at the GHB receptor than at the GABAB-receptor, resulting in a stimulating effect which would act synergistically with physostigmine and produce hyperstimulation when the GHB blood levels begin to drop.|$|E

Those with cataplexy have spells of muscle weakness precipitated by strong emotions, especially laughter or surprise. Cataplexy treatments include antidepressants or a GABA-B agonist, <b>gamma</b> <b>hydroxybutyrate</b> (GHB). GHB {{is the most}} effective treatment for cataplexy, but is expensive and can have significant side effects. A recent report of a murine model of narcolepsy-cataplexy suggests R-baclofen has potential efficacy against cataplexy. We report on two narcolepsy patients with multiple daily cataplexy episodes, one of whom had been effectively treated with GHB, but had to discontinue it for unrelated medical reasons. Both subsequently tried baclofen and experienced almost complete resolution of cataplexy. This report suggests baclofen can be an effective treatment for cataplexy in humans and warrants further study.

40|$|Club drugs † are a {{pharmacologically}} heterogeneous {{group of}} psychoactive compounds {{that tend to}} be abused by teens and young adults at a nightclub, bar, rave, or trance scene. <b>Gamma</b> <b>hydroxybutyrate</b> (GHB), Rohypnol, and ketamine {{are some of the}} drugs in this group; so are MDMA (ecstasy) and methamphetamine, which are featured in a separate InfoFacts. GHB (Xyrem) is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2002 for use in the treatment of narcolepsy (a sleep disorder). This approval came with severe restrictions, including its use only for the treatment of narcolepsy, and the requirement for a patient registry monitored by the FDA. GHB is also a metabolite of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA); thus, it is found naturally in the brain, but at concentrations much lower than doses that are abused. Rohypnol (flunitrazepam) started appearing in the United States in the early 1990 s. It is a benzodiazepine (chemically similar to Valium or Xanax), but it is not approved for medical use in this country, and its importation is banned.

40|$|Abstract. Club {{drugs such}} as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy), <b>gamma</b> <b>hydroxybutyrate</b> (GHB), and {{ketamine}} are among the fastest-growing drugs of abuse in the United States. Reports have shown that some gay and bisexual men are {{likely to engage in}} club-drug use in a myriad of venues. This is concerning given that the use of club drugs has been linked to high-risk sexual behaviors. Further, the use of club drugs by HIV-seropositive individuals may have detrimental outcomes on disease progression by either influencing adherence, resulting in drug-drug interactions with antiretrovirals, or potentially compounding immune suppression. Clinicians caring for HIV-seropositive and-seronegative individuals {{should be aware of the}} clinical effects and management guidelines associated with these chemicals. This article reviews the available literature with regard to the use of club drugs by HIV-seropositive and-seronegative gay and bisexual men. Although club-drug use may be associated with many risk behaviors for HIV infection, this review focuses on risk behavior among gay and bisexual men since this is the group for which the most data have been reported. The clinical effects and management guidelines associated with these agents are described, and the potential detrimental effects of these substances on HIV disease are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{decline in}} MDMA-like {{substances}} in ecstasy tablets {{has been reported}} {{by a number of}} countries in the European Union. This study describes the instability of the ecstasy market in The Netherlands during 2008 and 2009, and investigates whether this had any impact on drug testing or patterns of drug use. The health concerns of drug users handing in drug samples at drug testing facilities was measured using intervention time-series analysis. In addition, these ecstasy users were asked about changes in their drug use. Nationally, the unstable market situation for ecstasy has increased the number of users handing in ecstasy tablets for testing because of health concern. There was no change in the number of users handing in cocaine or <b>gamma</b> <b>hydroxybutyrate</b> (GHB). Respondents reported no major changes in their drug use resulting from the shortage of MDMA-like substances. These findings provide further insight in drug policy based on both harm reduction and use reduction. In the event of reduced ecstasy quality, ecstasy users in The Netherlands have increasingly used drug testing as a potential harm reduction tool, rather than changing their patterns of drug use. This might indicate that a transient reduction of drug quality does not serve as a good drug use reduction strategy for ecstasy user...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} characteristics {{of gay and}} bisexual men who attend circuit parties, frequency of and motivations for attending parties, drug use and sexual behavior during circuit party weekends, and use of risk reduction materials available at parties. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 295 gay and bisexual men from the San Francisco Bay Area who had attended a circuit party in the previous year. RESULTS: One fourth of the men reported a drug "overuse" incident in the previous year. Nearly all respondents reported use of drugs during circuit party weekends, including ecstasy (75 %), ketamine (58 %), crystal methamphetamine (36 %), <b>gamma</b> <b>hydroxybutyrate</b> or gamma butyrolactone (25 %), and Viagra (12 %). Two thirds of the men reported having sex (oral or anal), 49 % reported having anal sex, and 28 % reported having unprotected anal sex during the 3 -day period. An association was found between use of drugs and sexual risk behavior. Prevention materials were observed at party events by some men; however, relatively few men used the materials. Common motivations for attending the parties were "to listen to music and dance" and "to be with friends.

40|$|Abstract I In recent years, {{the use of}} <b>gamma.</b> <b>hydroxybutyrate</b> (GHB), as a {{recreational}} drug has prompted forensic toxicology laboratories to incorporate the analysis for GHB into their routine screening procedures. GHB, being a natural occurring constituent of the human body, presents a challenge for forensic toxicologists in that endogenous levels and exogenous levels of GHB need to be differentiated in case samples. This {{study was designed to}} determine lypical urinary endogenous levels of GHB in humans based on the analysis of urine samples voluntarily provided by 55 male and female subjects ranging in age from 6 to 59 years. All samples were initially screened for the presence of GHB utilizing a hydrolysis method designed to quantitatively convert the GHB in urine samples to gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) followed by the liquid-liquid extraction and analysis of any GBL present by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). As a confirmation test, samples were then extracted by a solid-phase extraction technique, derivatized to GHB di-TMS, and analyzed by GC-MS. The median concentration determined for the 55 subjects was 1. 3 mg/mt (mean = 1. 65 pg/mL, range 0. 9 pg/mL to 3. 5 pg/mL, standard deviation 0. 68 pg/mL). The results of this study confirm the previously suggested cutoff of 10 IJg/mL for routine forensic analyses...|$|E
40|$|Because {{illicit drugs}} are now widely consumed, every doctor {{needs to know}} their acute medical {{consequences}} and complications. Here, we review {{the problems associated with}} the different drugs from a systems-based viewpoint. Apart from the respiratory depressant effect of opioids, crack cocaine is {{the most common cause of}} respiratory complications, mainly linked with its mode of use, with airway burns, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and lung syndromes being well-recognised sequelae. Because of its marked cardiovascular effects, cocaine is also a major cause of coronary syndromes and myocardial infarction. Amphetamines may produce similar effects less commonly. Hyperthermia may occur with cocaine toxicity or with 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) due to exertion or from serotonin syndrome. Cerebral haemorrhage may result from the use of amphetamines or cocaine. Hallucinations may follow consumption of LSD, amphetamines, or cocaine. MDMA is a major cause of acute severe hyponatraemia and also has been linked with hepatic syndromes. Collapse, convulsions, or coma may be caused in different circumstances by opioids, MDMA, or <b>gamma</b> <b>hydroxybutyrate</b> and may be aggravated by other sedatives, especially alcohol and benzodiazepines. Recognition of these acute complications is urgent, and treatment must be based on an understanding of the likely underlying problem as well as on basic principles of supportive care...|$|E
40|$|<b>Gamma</b> <b>hydroxybutyrate</b> (GHB) is {{a central}} nervous system {{depressant}} with euphoric and relaxant effects. Documentation of GHB prevalence and the underreporting of abuse remains problematic, given the availability of GHB and its precursors γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and 1, 4 -butanediol (1, 4 -BD) and the ease of synthesis from kits available on the Internet. The continued abuse of and dependence on GHB, and associated fatalities, present an on-going public health problem. As the drug GHB remains an underresearched topic, a scoping review was chosen as a technique to map the available literature into a descriptive summarized account. PRISMA was used to assist in data retrieval, with subsequent data charting into three key themes (pharmacology and toxicology, outcomes, and user groups). Administered orally, GHB is dose-dependent and popular for certain uses (therapeutic, body enhancement, sexual assault) and amongst user sub groups (recreational party drug users, homosexual men). Despite the low prevalence of use in comparison to other club drugs, rising abuse of the drug is associated with dependence, withdrawal, acute toxicity, and fatal overdose. Clinical diagnosis and treatment is complicated by the co-ingestion of alcohol and other drugs. Limitations of the scoping review and potential for further research and harm reduction initiatives are discussed...|$|E
40|$|We enjoyed reading Hailer et al. recent {{evaluation}} of a novel assay to detect urine <b>gamma</b> <b>hydroxybutyrate</b> (GHB) concentrations (1). Although this study was well-designed, using a double-blind, four-arm, crossover design, we have some concerns over their results. Specifically, the authors note that GHB disappears from the urine more rapidly than previously noted. The study used sodium oxybate, a solid salt, whereas street GHB is a colorless, poorly charged liquid. These two formulations have different pharmacokinetic properties and may exhibit different urinary assay results. Furthermore, the interactions of these two forms of GHB with ethanol may be distinct. Also, we question whether the ingested dose may alter the results. Though we recognize the limitation of a human volunteer study, it is striking that the authors do not provide a clinical description of the subjects. The absence of significant sedation following the co-ingestion of ethanol and GHB suggests that the dose is small in relation to street doses. This {{could lead to a}} shorter detection window. Finally, the authors raise {{the question of whether or}} not the co-ingestion ofethanol and GHB reduces urine GHB levels. The current study esign allows the use of each subject as their own control.

40|$|Introduction: {{misuse of}} <b>gamma</b> <b>hydroxybutyrate</b> (GHB) and gamma {{butyrolactone}} (GBL) increased in Western countries {{from the early}} 1990 s. The period since has seen a rising numbers of deaths. This presentation outlines the evolution and principal characteristics of United Kingdom (UK) fatalities. Methods: analysis of trends and principal characteristics in such deaths using information mainly extracted from the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths database, which receives information voluntarily from coroners and other sources on drug-related deaths in the UK and the Islands. Relevant cases associated with use of GHB, GBL and 1, 4 - BD were identified by searching the database with the following terms - 'GHB', 'GBH', ???GBL???, ??? 1, 4 -BD???, ???BDO???, 'gamma hydroxybutyrate', ???gamma butyrolactone??? and 'sodium oxybate'. The exact number of GHB-related fatalities is unknown due to its endogenous nature and rapid elimination, limiting toxicological detection. Results: by September 2013, 159 relevant fatalities were reported; rising from 1 in 1995 to peak at 25 in 2009. Principal characteristics: White; young (mean age: 32 years); male (82 %); drug misuse history (70 %). Most deaths (79 %) were accidental or related to drug use, the remainder being (potential) suicides. GHB/GBL alone was implicated in 37 % of cases. Commonest co-ingested substances were alcohol, diazepam, stimulants, opioids, and ketamine. Post mortem blood levels tend to be twice that of deaths involving GHB/GBL on its own compared with co-ingestion. Conclusions: the data suggest a significant level of caution when ingesting GHB/GBL, particularly with CNS depressants and/or stimulants. Deaths still occur despite legal controls on GHB and its analogues...|$|E

Until now, treatment seeking GHB users have hardly been studied. This study characterizes inpatients in treatment for GHB dependence in terms of sociodemographics, motives for substance use and reasons for seeking treatment. In addition, variables associated with dependence severity are identified. Patients were recruited by their therapists at 4 different addiction treatment centers dispersed throughout the Netherlands. They were asked {{to fill out the}} questionnaire, including sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, GHB and other drug use, and {{a modified version of the}} Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT) to screen for GHB dependence. The associations of relevant variables with dependence severity were determined using multiple regression analysis. A total of 75 inpatients (response rate 90. 4 %) participated in the study. Most patients were young (mean 26. 8 ± 9. 1) males (73 %) with low education (78 %) and not employed (48 %). Most of them (75 %) had started using GHB the year before treatment admission, 42 (56 %) frequently combined GHB with sedatives and 26 (35 %) frequently combined GHB with stimulants. Dependence severity was strongly associated with sleep problems and the combined use of GHB and stimulants.

40|$|Epidemiology: Date-rape drugs cause {{sedation}} and amnesia to {{the extent}} that their victims cannot resist or may not be aware of a sexual assault. About 25 % of the 1400 women who contact the Canadian Sexual Assault Centre each year report that drugs were a factor in a rape. 1 Drug-facilitated rape is most commonly linked to the surreptitious administration of flunitrazepam (Ro-hypnol) or of a newer arrival, <b>gamma</b> <b>hydroxybutyrate</b> acid (GHB). Reports from the police and emergency depart-ments suggest that use of these drugs, particularly GHB, in sexual assaults is increasing. 2 Routine tests to detect the drugs are not widely available, prompt-ing one Ontario Liberal MPP to push the province to provide immediate test-ing for women who suspect they have been victims of date rape. Well intentioned though that initia-tive may be, widespread testing is al-ready available for the drugs most com-monly used in date rape: alcohol, marijuana, benzodiazepines, cocaine, heroin and amphetamines. Any sub-stance that is administered to lower sex-ual inhibition and enhance the possibil-ity of unwanted sexual intercourse is potentially a date-rape drug. Of 2003 urine samples submitted by rape treat-ment centres across the United States within 72 hours of a suspected drug-facilitated rape, GHB was detected in only 3 % of the samples and fluni-trazepam in less than 1 %; alcohol was detected in 69 % of the samples, mari-juana in 18 % and cocaine in 5 %. 3 Physicians {{should be aware of the}} mechanisms and clinical management of flunitrazepam and GHB intoxication, but they should also be aware that, when a drug-facilitated rape is suspect-ed, alcohol is the substance most likely involved...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Gay and {{bisexual}} men (GBM) with undiagnosed HIV {{are believed to}} contribute disproportionately to HIV transmission in Australia but national prevalence estimates have been lacking. Methods: From November 2013 to November 2014, we recruited men at gay venues and events in six Australian states and territories. Of 7291 survey participants, 3071 men also provided an oral fluid sample for testing and decided whether to receive their test results or not. We calculated raw and population-weighted prevalence estimates and identified associations with undiagnosed infection using logistic regression. Results: Of 3071 participants, 213 men tested HIV-positive (6. 9 %, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 6. 0 to 7. 8 %), of whom 19 (8. 9 %, 95 % CI 5. 8 to 13. 5 %) were previously undiagnosed. After weighting for {{the size of the}} gay {{and bisexual}} male population in each state or territory, national HIV prevalence was estimated to be 7. 2 % (95 % CI 6. 3 to 8. 1), of which 9. 1 % (95 % CI 6. 0 to 13. 6 %) were estimated to be undiagnosed. Compared with HIV-negative participants, men with undiagnosed HIV {{were more likely to report}} meeting partners at sex venues, using antiretroviral drugs as pre-exposure prophylaxis, condomless anal intercourse with casual partners, using party drugs for sex, injecting drugs and using amyl nitrite, crystal methamphetamine or <b>gamma</b> <b>hydroxybutyrate</b> in the six months prior to the survey.

40|$|Recent media {{coverage}} has raised {{awareness of the}} involvement of drugs, both licit and illicit, in the crime of ‘date ’ or ‘acquaintance ’ rape. The term ‘date rape drug ’ has been coined and {{has been used to}} label a few specific drugs because of their alleged properties. These include flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), <b>gamma</b> <b>hydroxybutyrate</b> (GHB) and ketamine. Concerns over reports of flunitrazepam in connection with ‘date rape ’ led to action by the manufacturer of Rohypnol (flunitrazepam), F. Homan-La Roche Ltd. who undertook an educational campaign warning of the dangers of drug-assisted sexual assault, and changed their drug’s formulation internationally to prevent its clandestine use. Despite the media interest, there has been little evidence and no systematic investigation to date of the incidence of drug use in the crime of sexual assault. The present study, from the USA, was therefore instigated to assess the extent to which dierent drugs were present in the urinalysis of samples supplied by victims of rape where drugs were allegedly involved. The study was so designed as to examine any changes over time in the patterns of drug use in sexual assault. Between June 1996 and May 1998, 1033 samples were tested. Nearly 20 dierent substances were detected among the 611 specimens that tested positive. Of these, 382 (37 per cent of all specimens) were positive for alcohol and 191 (18. 5 per cent) were positive for cannabinoids. GHB was detected in 4. 4 per cent of samples. Only six (50. 6 per cent) specimens showed evidence of flunitrazepam, and four of those contained other substances including cocaine, alcohol and/or morphine. Thus, only 0. 2 per cent of all samples were positive for flunitrazepam alone. These data clearly indicate that {{there is no evidence of}} widespread misuse of flunitrazepam in sexual assault.

40|$|Introduction: Transmission of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) among HIV-positive men {{who have}} sex with men (MSM) in the United Kingdom is ongoing. We explore {{associations}} between self-reported sexual behaviours and drug use with cumulative HCV prevalence, as well as new HCV diagnosis. Methods: ASTRA is a cross-sectional questionnaire study including 2, 248 HIV-diagnosed MSM under care in the United Kingdom during 2011 – 2012. Socio-demographic, lifestyle, HIV-related and sexual behaviour data were collected during the study. One thousand seven hundred and fifty two (≥ 70 %) of the MSM who consented to linkage of ASTRA and clinical information (prior to and post questionnaire) were included. Cumulative prevalence of HCV was defined as any positive anti-HCV or HCV-RNA test result at any point prior to questionnaire completion. We excluded 536 participants with clinical records only after questionnaire completion. Among the remaining 1, 216 MSM, we describe associations of self-reported sexual behaviours and recreational drug use in the three months prior to ASTRA with cumulative HCV prevalence, using modified Poisson regression with robust error variances. New HCV was defined as any positive anti-HCV or HCV-RNA after questionnaire completion. We excluded 591 MSM who reported ever having a HCV diagnosis at questionnaire, any positive HCV result prior to questionnaire or did not have any HCV tests after the questionnaire. Among the remaining 1, 195 MSM, we describe occurrence of new HCV diagnosis during follow-up according to self-reported sexual behaviours and recreational drug use three months prior to questionnaire (Fisher's exact test). Results: Cumulative HCV prevalence among MSM prior to ASTRA was 13. 3 % (95 % CI 11. 5 – 15. 4). Clinic- and age-adjusted prevalence ratios (95 % CI) for cumulative HCV prevalence were 4. 6 (3. 1 – 6. 7) for methamphetamine, 6. 5 (3. 5 – 12. 1) for injection drugs, 2. 3 (1. 6 – 3. 4) for <b>gamma</b> <b>hydroxybutyrate</b> (GHB), 1. 6 (1. 3 – 2. 0) for nitrites, 1. 7 (1. 5 – 2. 0) for all condom-less sex (CLS), 2. 1 (1. 7 – 2. 5) for CLS-HIV-seroconcordant, 1. 3 (0. 9 – 1. 9) for CLS-HIV-serodiscordant, 2. 0 (1. 6 – 2. 5) for group sex, 1. 5 (1. 2 – 1. 9) for more than 10 new sexual partners in the past year. Among 1, 195 MSM with 2. 2 years [IQR 1. 5 – 2. 4] median follow-up, there were 7 new HCV cases during 2, 033 person-years at risk. Incidence was 3. 5 per 1, 000 person-years (95 % CI 1. 6 – 7. 2). New HCV was recorded in 1. 3 % MSM who used methamphetamine versus 0. 5 % MSM who did not (p= 0. 385); 3. 7 % MSM who injected recreational drugs versus 0. 5 % MSM who did not (p= 0. 148); 2. 9 % MSM who used GHB versus 0. 4 % MSM who did not (p= 0. 003); 1. 5 % MSM who used nitrites versus 0. 2 % MSM who did not (p= 0. 019); 1. 1 % MSM having CLS versus 0. 3 % MSM who did not (p= 0. 084); 1. 7 % MSM having CLS-HIV-serodiscordant versus 0. 4 % MSM who did not (p= 0. 069); 0. 9 % MSM who had CLS-HIV-seroconcordant versus 0. 5 % MSM who did not (p= 0. 318); 0. 8 % MSM who had group sex versus 0. 5 % MSM who did not (p= 0. 463); and 1. 6 % MSM with = 10 new sexual partners in the previous year versus 0. 2 % MSM with no or up to 9 new partners (p= 0. 015). Conclusions: Self-reported recent use of recreational and injection drugs, condom-less sex and multiple new sexual partners are associated with pre-existing HCV infection and, with the exception of injection drugs, appear to be predictive of new HCV co-infection among HIV-diagnosed MSM...|$|E
