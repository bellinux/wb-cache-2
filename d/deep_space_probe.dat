An acquisition and tracking point design to support a high bandwidth downlink from a 20 -cm optical terminal on an orbiting Mars spacecraft typically calls for 2. 5 kW of 1030 -nm uplink optical power in 40 micro-radians divergent beams. 2 The NOHD (nominal ocular hazard distance) of the 1030 nm uplink is in excess of 2 E 5 km, approximately half {{the distance to the}} moon.

In terms of space activities {{only a small number}} of sub-orbital sounding rocket tests are conducted. In June 2010, however, Woomera hosted the return of the Hayabusa <b>Deep</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Probe.</b> This was the first planned space re-entry to Australian soil and created another milestone for the Range (See Woomera Test Range for more information).|$|E
50|$|On 19 March 1991, aerobraking was {{demonstrated}} by the Hiten spacecraft. This was the first aerobraking maneuver by a <b>deep</b> <b>space</b> <b>probe.</b> Hiten (a.k.a. MUSES-A) was launched by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) of Japan. Hiten flew by the Earth {{at an altitude of}} 125.5 km over the Pacific at 11.0 km/s. Atmospheric drag lowered the velocity by 1.712 m/s and the apogee altitude by 8665 km. Another aerobraking maneuver was conducted on 30 March.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the first}} lunar swing-by, Hiten {{released}} a small orbiter, Hagoromo (はごろも, {{named after the}} feather mantle of Hiten), into lunar orbit. The transmitter on Hagoromo failed, but its orbit was visually confirmed from Earth. After the eighth swing-by, Hiten successfully demonstrated the aerobraking technique on March 19, 1991. This was the first aerobraking maneuver by a <b>deep</b> <b>space</b> <b>probe.</b> [...] After the ninth lunar swing-by and second aero-braking maneuver on March 30, 1991, the primary mission of the probe was concluded.|$|E

40|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>space</b> <b>probes</b> and {{planetary}} exploration missions require electrical power {{management and control}} systems {{that are capable of}} efficient and reliable operation in very cold temperature environments. Typically, in <b>deep</b> <b>space</b> <b>probes,</b> heating elements are used to keep the spacecraft electronics near room temperature. The utilization of power electronics designed for and operated at low temperature will contribute to increasing efficiency and improving reliability of space power systems. At NASA Glenn Research Center, commercial-off-the-shelf devices as well as developed components are being investigated for potential use at low temperatures. These devices include semiconductor switching devices, magnetics, and capacitors. Integrated circuits such as digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters, DC/DC converters, operational amplifiers, and oscillators are also being evaluated. In this paper, results will be presented for selected analog-to-digital converters, oscillators, DC/DC converters, and pulse width modulation (PWM) controllers...|$|R
30|$|To improve this inversion, {{additional}} constraints can {{be found}} in ZL surveys from <b>deep</b> <b>space</b> <b>probes.</b> We show that both the Pioneer 10 (Toller and Weinberg, 1985) and (despite their lack of in-ecliptic scans) the Helios (Leinert et al., 1982) data imply the phase function to weakly depart from isotropy, at least in the 30 °– 150 ° range.|$|R

He detailed {{the space shuttle}} program from its infancy, although he was in Pasadena covering <b>deep</b> <b>space</b> <b>probe</b> Voyager's encounter with Uranus when the shuttle Challenger blew up in January 1986. The Washington Post published a book later that year called Challengers: The Inspiring Life Stories of the Seven Brave Astronauts of Shuttle Mission 51-L, with 12 Post reporters contributing. O'Toole wrote Chapter One.|$|E
5000|$|Sakigake (lit.

It aimed to demonstrate {{the performance of the}} new launch vehicle, test the schemes of the first escape from the Earth gravitation for Japan on engineering basis, and observe space plasma and magnetic field in interplanetary space. Sakigake was also supposed to get references for scientists. Early measurements would be used to improve the mission of the Suisei probe several months later.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s, she {{switched}} to software testing and subsystem engineering for the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN). A systems engineer {{in the context}} of NASA “encourages the use of tools and methods to better comprehend and manage complexity in systems”. The DSN is used to track and communicate with every <b>deep</b> <b>space</b> <b>probe</b> sponsored by NASA as well as non-US space missions. The research group tracked the Russian spacecraft Vega which carried a French balloon to Venus on its journey to Halley’s comet. Although working with the Russians was difficult during this Cold War time period, her team was able to collaborate well with the French and they successfully delivered tracking data for the French balloon to route toward the comet. Finley considers this project the most memorable of her many years at NASA.|$|E
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{was developed}} in the design bureau then known as OKB-1, under Chief Designer Sergei Korolev (who had died before the launch). The first 11 launches were unsuccessful due to different reasons and finally it was ready for a successful launch. At that time the project was transferred to Lavochkin design bureau since OKB-1 was busy with a manned expedition to the Moon. Luna 9 was the twelfth attempt at a soft-landing by the Soviet Union; it was also the first successful <b>deep</b> <b>space</b> <b>probe</b> built by the Lavochkin design bureau, which ultimately would design and build almost all Soviet (later Russian) lunar and interplanetary spacecraft. All operations prior to landing occurred without fault, and the 58 cm spheroid ALS capsule landed on the Moon at 18:45:30 UT on 3 February 1966 west of the craters Reiner and Marius in the Ocean of Storms (at 7°8' north latitude and 64°22' west longitude). Approximately five minutes after touchdown, Luna 9 began transmitting data to Earth, but it was seven hours (after the Sun had climbed to 7° elevation) before the probe began sending the first of nine images (including five panoramas) of the surface of the Moon.|$|E
5000|$|Note however, {{that all}} these {{spacecraft}} suffer from Earth blockage to varying degrees. Also, the more sophisticated the [...] "staring" [...] instrument, the lower the sky coverage. Randomly occurring GRBs {{are more likely to}} be missed, or detected at low resolution only. The use of non-directional <b>deep</b> <b>space</b> <b>probes,</b> such as MESSENGER and BepiColombo, will continue.|$|R

40|$|Electric Propulsion (EP) is that {{in which}} {{electrical}} energy, rather than chemical energy, is used to accelerate a propellant to produce thrust.

The very high specific impulse that can be generated by an EP system offers the potential of greatly expanding the scope of missions that can be ac~ieved by small spacecraft.

Obstacles included large expected fluctuations in ambient temperature, variations in voltage supply levels outgassing concerns, heater circuit design, materials selection, and power control options. Successful resolution of these issues helped to establish a methodology which {{can be applied to}} many of the heater design challenges found in thermally actuated mechanisms...|$|E
