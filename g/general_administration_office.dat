5000|$|The 13th ordynat, Konstanty Zamoyski, {{introduced}} several {{changes to}} the estate. In 1833, he created the Central Office of Goods and Businesses of the Zamoyski Family, as well as <b>General</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>Office</b> in Zwierzyniec. Zamoyski divided the office into four departments (legal, administrative, political and economic), {{each with its own}} manager. [...] At the same time, serfdom was gradually withdrawn and replaced by money wages (15 grosz per one day of work). Furthermore, to increase profits several folwarks were rented to private owners, and the management of the forests took on a planned shape. In the mid-19th century, the estate had an area of 373,723 hectares, and its population was 107,764, with nine towns, 291 villages, 116 folwarks, 41 mills, eight breweries, seven distilleries and several other enterprises. Altogether, the profits of the fee tail were estimated at 1.4 million zlotys annually.|$|E
40|$|Using {{data from}} a logging {{experiment}} in the eastern Brazilian Amazon region, we develop a matrix growth and yield model that captures the dynamic effects of harvest system choice on forest structure and composition. Multinomial logistic regression is used to estimate the growth transition parameters for a 10 -year time step, while a Poisson regression model is used to estimate recruitment parameters. The model {{is designed to be}} easily integrated with an economic model of decisionmaking to perform tropical forest policy analysis. The model is used to compare the long-run structure and composition of a stand arising from the choice of implementing either conventional logging techniques or more carefully planned and executed reduced-impact logging (RIL) techniques, contrasted against a baseline projection of an unlogged forest. Results from log and leave scenarios show that a stand logged according to Brazilian management requirements will require well over 120 years to recover its initial commercial volume, regardless of logging technique employed. Implementing RIL, however, accelerates this recovery. Scenarios imposing a 40 -year cutting cycle raise the possibility of sustainable harvest volumes, although at significantly lower levels than is implied by current regulations. Meeting current Brazilian forest policy goals may require an increase in the planned total area of permanent production forest or the widespread adoption of silvicultural practices that increase stand recovery and volume accumulation rates after RIL harvests.

5000|$|The {{transition}} {{process begins}} as leading presidential contenders begin making preliminary plans for building an administration and assuming the presidency {{should they be}} elected. Candidate Mitt Romney established a transition team in June 2012 (after some preparatory work in April and May), which was before he became the Republican Party nominee. Barack Obama followed a similar timeline for establishing his transition team in 2008. During the most recent presidential election cycle, in 2016, Donald Trump began assembling his transition team in May, after he became the presumptive Republican nominee. His fall campaign opponent, Hillary Clinton, lagged behind in this regard, not forming a transition team until August, which was after she became the Democratic Party nominee. [...] Key activities in this pre-election phase include: setting goals for the transition; assembling and organizing the key transition team staff; allocating responsibilities among the team and allocating resources and personnel for each core work stream; developing an overall management work plan to guide the team through the entire transition process; and establishing relationships with Congress, the outgoing <b>administration,</b> <b>General</b> Services <b>Administration,</b> the <b>Office</b> of Government Ethics, the FBI and the Office of Personnel Management to encourage information sharing and to begin the security clearance process for select personnel.|$|R
