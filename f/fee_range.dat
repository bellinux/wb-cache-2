50|$|Most public {{adjusters}} {{are paid}} {{based on a}} percentage of the total settlement. For example, one Georgia company states their fee is between 5% and 10% based on the type and amount of the insurance claim. However, lower percentages are used for larger losses. Higher percentages are needed for smaller losses. Smaller insurance claims can have similar costs as larger claims, but because the recovery is less on smaller claims the <b>fee</b> <b>range</b> must be adjusted to compensate the operating costs. Fees of 10% to 12% are ordinary and typical for losses of $100,000 or greater when handled by standard-rated public adjusters. Expert-rated public adjusters get a higher fee than standard-rated adjusters. For example, an expert public adjuster can charge 12% to 15% on a loss that exceeds $100,000. However, experts possess capabilities to obtain the most effective results. Therefore, highly qualified adjusters can be expected to be better skilled at achieving a better increased settlement amount than an adjuster who is not an expert. Adjusters who are experts must be classified and registered as an expert by the judicial system. Most public adjusters are not court-registered expert adjusters. Some public adjusters charge a flat percentage, while others use a regressive scale. For example, 25% of the first $100,000, 15% between $100,001 and $200,000, and 10% of any amount beyond that. Claims that are less than $50,000 are considered small losses. There are Public Adjusters who will not service smaller claims at all, while other public adjusters charge a normal range of a 30% to 35% fee rate for insurance claims with a settlement value that is less than $50,000. Public adjusters can charge a lower fee on the total settlement value of the claim, or they can charge a higher fee on an improved settlement amount that is beyond the initial settlement originally offered by the insuring organization. For example, for a $100,000 loss, a fee can be 12% on the whole claim value, where the risk is shared but for a lower fee; or alternatively, if the initial settlement was $50,000, then a public adjuster might accept a 25% fee not on the initial $50,000 but on any additional recovery settlement, a partial amount, exceeding the initial $50,000 regardless of the additional amount. However, this additional recovery method means that the public adjuster takes all of the risk, hence the higher fee. It's important to note that some states cap public adjuster fees at levels such as 10% or 20%, and some consumers opine that normal public adjuster fees are standardized, citing 10% on any claim regardless of its value. This is incorrect, and also because such limitations can cause public adjusters to avoid smaller claims altogether, since the services' costs can be a liability without providing a fair, reasonable and necessary business profit. Most states do not cap fees for this reason. Higher fees on smaller claims can provide the adequate compensation that a public adjuster needs to accept the costs of providing full services. Regardless of the fee structure, the fee may be offset by an increase in the settlement amount. In many jurisdictions, the fee structure must be disclosed up front. It {{is important to note that}} a public adjuster cannot obtain more than the policyholder is legitimately entitled to. However, the full potential recovery value of an insurance claim is often not obtained without professional assistance like that which comes from a very capable public adjuster.|$|E

For example, one Georgia company states their fee is between 5% and 10% based on the type and amount of the insurance claim.

All public adjusters are not equal in their abilities to secure policy benefits. Skills of performance can vary significantly between public adjusters ranging from basic to elite expert. Fees of 10% to 12% are ordinary and typical for claimed losses of $100,000 or greater when handled by standard-rated public adjusters. Expert-rated public adjusters get a higher fee than standard-rated adjusters. For example, an expert public adjuster can charge 12% to 15% on a loss that exceeds $100,000. However, superior experts possess capabilities to obtain the most effective results. Therefore, highly qualified adjusters can be expected to be better skilled at achieving a greater increased benefits settlement amount than an adjuster who is not an actual expert. Adjusters who are experts must be classified and registered as an expert by the judicial system. Public adjusters declaring themselves to be experts should be verified, because such notice is not always factual. For those public adjusters who proclaim to be actual experts, it's highly recommended that their credentials be validated to prove such qualifications. Most public adjusters are not court-registered experts, but instead just have claims experience. Experience is often not expertise. Some public adjusters charge a flat percentage or a flat fee set price, while others use a regressive scale. It depends, in part, on the State Law where the loss occurred. For example, a regressive scale can be 25% of the first $100,000, 15% between $100,001 and $200,000, and 10% of any amount beyond that. Claims that are less than $50,000 are considered small claim losses. There are Public Adjusters who will not service smaller claims at all, while other public adjusters charge a normal range of a 30% to 35% fee rate for insurance claims with a settlement value that is less than $50,000. Public adjusters can charge a lower fee on the total settlement value of the claim, or they can charge a higher fee on an improved settlement amount that is beyond the initial settlement originally offered by the insuring organization. For example, for a $100,000 loss, a fee can be 12% on the whole claim value, where the cost risk can be a shared expense with the client, but for a lower fee which is a benefit for the client; or alternatively, if the initial settlement was $50,000, then a public adjuster might accept a 25% fee —not on the initial $50,000― but on any additional recovery settlement referred to as [...] "new money", being a partial claim value of an amount which exceeds the initial $50,000 settlement, where fees apply exclusively to only the additional amount recovered. However, this additional recovery method of [...] "new money only" [...] means that the public adjuster assumes all of the cost risk and expense, with no cost risk shared by the client, hence the higher fee. (For a claim not covered by the Policy, the public adjuster could experience a business loss from operating expenses spent on [...] "new money only" [...] claims that are limited to only improved settlement recovery services). There are public adjusters who contract for [...] "new money only" [...] services but charge fees of 40% and 50% to accept that high risk, where any improved settlement benefit, or the new money recovered, is essentially split about evenly between the public adjuster and the client. It's important to note that some states cap public adjuster fees at levels such as 10% or 20%, and some consumers opine that normal public adjuster fees are standardized, citing 10% on any claim regardless of its value. This is not accurate and cannot work. Such limitations can cause public adjusters to avoid helping consumers with smaller claims altogether when the services' costs can actually become a financial loss if not providing a fair, reasonable and necessary business earnings' margin needed by public adjuster firms in order to operate, just as with any business. Most states do not cap fees for this reason, while nearly all states welcome public adjuster services for their insuring public. Professional fees must be adequate for public adjusters to cover operating and business costs while still providing sufficient business income returns on those costs. Higher fees on smaller claims having low recovery values are necessary to provide the adequate compensation that a public adjuster needs to accept the costs of providing full services. Regardless of the fee structure, the public adjuster professional fee may, and will likely, be offset by an increase in the settlement amount on a covered claim. In many jurisdictions, the fee structure must be disclosed up front. It {{is important to note that}} a public adjuster cannot obtain more than the policyholder is legitimately entitled to, but public adjusters ―especially experts― generally recover a better financial settlement benefit than the fees charged to their clients, thereby leaving their clients with a net financial improvement of benefits recovery after fees are paid. The indemnity promised and provided for by an insurance policy, or the full potential financial recovery value of an insurance claim, is often not obtainable without professional assistance like that which comes from a very capable public adjuster.|$|E

40|$|Because of {{the cost}} and {{environmental}} issues, {{what to do with}} the waste, mainly sludge, from wastewater treatment is a critical issue to make a cleaner and more sustainable world. Thermal hydrolysis process (THP) before anaerobic digestion of the sludge is getting attention because of its simple implementation and advantages for both economic and environmental aspects. THP needs energy and additional cost, but more benefit can be gained by using sludge as a renewable energy source, fertilizer or feedstock for the monetization strategy because of reduction of operating cost and Green House Gas (GHG) emission. Since GHG is a primary reason of climate change which raises the devastation of sustainability of the world, it is momentous to make an effort to reduce the emission of GHG. In the eco-industrial park (EIP), for more process water reuse and water disposal under the stricter regulation, the need for wastewater treatment facilities is growing. Also, there is surplus energy from the processes that can be used to operate the THP, so the EIP can serve as a ?sustainable center? where GHG emission is reduced by treating bio-waste in the centralized structure with its surplus heat. By having THP, EIP can improve its sustainability and economy while preparing for the impact of a carbon tax in the near future. In this study, economic feasibility of THP, impact of carbon tax on the economy of the biological wastewater treatment system with THP, adequate tipping <b>fee</b> <b>range</b> for the outer bio-waste, sensitivity analysis on the characteristic of bio-waste, and impact of THP within EIP having a centralized water exchange network were investigated to assess the possibility of EIP as a sustainable center.

40|$|The tobacco {{industry}} {{has been active in}} Texas politics for over 25 years. It spends money on lobbying, campaign contributions, legislative events and gifts in order to gain favor with the legislature and attempt to control the agenda set for tobacco control efforts. Political campaign contributions–reported only by Philip Morris–have remained high throughout the 1990 s. Philip Morris reported contributing $ 556, 250 to legislative, judicial and statewide candidates between 1988 and 2001. In recent years, their contributions to statewide officeholders and judicial candidates have decreased as their legislative contributions have increased. In each election cycle, 1998 - 1999 and 2000 - 2001, Philip Morris contributed $ 51, 000 to legislative candidates. The 3 largest lifetime recipients of campaign contributions in the legislature were all Senators: David Cain ($ 8, 250, D-Mesquite), Ken Armbrister ($ 5, 500, D-Victoria), and Chris Harris ($ 5, 500, R-Arlington). The largest recipient of tobacco money from the statewide offices was former Lt. Governor Bob Bullock who received $ 36, 500 from the {{tobacco industry}} from 1988 - 1996. The tobacco industry has also spent heavily on lobbying, although it is impossible to calculate the exact amounts. When lobbyists’ report their fees to the Texas Ethics Commission, they are only required to report a <b>fee</b> <b>range</b> for each of their clients, not the exact amount that they were paid by each client. For example, a lobbyist would select between the ranges of $ 0 -$ 10, 000, $ 10 -$ 25, 000, $ 25 -$ 50, 000, etc. However, given these estimates, we can determine that from 1993 - 2001, the tobacco industry spent between $ 4, 660, 000 -$ 9, 640, 000 on lobbyists’ fees to influence the legislature. Texas’ only statewide tobacco control laws are Senate Bill 55 (by Senator Zaffarini, DLaredo) and House Bill 119 (by Rep. Hirschi, D-Wichita Falls), both passed during the 1997 legislative session. SB 55 is the “Texas Tobacco Law” which establishes strict penalties for retailers who sell tobacco to minors and for minors in possession of tobacco products. The tobacco industry fought heavily against the legislation. The provisions in SB 55 which impose penalties upon minors are controversial among public health advocates because they distract attention from retailers and clerks who sell tobacco to minors. HB 119 is an ingredient disclosure bill, requiring manufacturers who sell tobacco products in Texas to report their ingredients to the Texas Department of Health. The tobacco industry uses allies like the Texas Restaurant Association, the Texas Retailers Association and the Texas Association of Business and Chambers of Commerce (TABCC) in order to shield its involvement in tobacco control issues. Restaurant owners are mobilized to oppose smoking restrictions and retailers testify against youth access and advertising restrictions. The TABCC opposed the state’s lawsuit against the tobacco industry, with coaching on the issue from tobacco industry lobbyists. The tobacco industry has partnered with and heavily sponsored the activities of the Texas Civil Justice League (TCJL) in order to enact tort reform legislation which protects the industry from prosecution. In the tort reform and products liability legislation during the 1993 and 1995 sessions, the tobacco industry and TCJL limited punitive damage awards and the rights of plaintiffs to sue the tobacco industry for smoking-related illnesses. In 1996, then- Attorney General Dan Morales was the third Attorney General to sue the tobacco industry. He settled the case in 1998, prior to the 46 state settlement known as the Master Settlement Agreement. Texas’ suit against the industry resulted in a $ 17. 3 billion dollar settlement. From the money that the state has received as of 2001 ($ 1. 8 billion), only $ 30 million has been spent on tobacco control programs from 1999 - 2001. In 1999, the state legislature deposited $ 200 million into a tobacco trust fund to be used for statewide tobacco control programs. However, the legislature only allowed for the interest on that money to be spent for tobacco control (about $ 9 million annually). The Texas Department of Health, charged with developing a tobacco control program with that small amount of money, was required to focus their efforts in East Texas. The Texas Department of Health comprehensive tobacco control program has been very successful, however, their attempts to secure more funding and expand the program statewide have failed. In 2001, the Legislature only increased funding for the program to $ 12 million annually. The Centers for Disease Control’s Best Practices recommends that a state with the size and population of Texas should spend between $ 103 million - $ 180 million annually for an effective tobacco control program. Texas’ only statewide smoking regulations, the 1975 Clean Indoor Air Act, sets up minimum standards for smoke-free public places. All of the state’s effective smoking regulations have been passed by local governments. Most of the regulations simply establish smoking and nonsmoking sections in workplaces and restaurants. In recent years, several communities, including some surrounding the state capitol in Austin and the West Texas town of El Paso, establish 100 % smoke-free public places, including workplaces and restaurants. El Paso’s smoking ordinance, passed in 2001, also establishes smoke-free bars, the first ordinance of its kind in Texas. Beginning with the initiative of a sixth grade student, Lubbock enacted a strong clean indoor air ordinance. The tobacco industry, working with the Restaurant Association and Libertarians, opposed the ordinance. After the city council enacted the ordinance, the Libertarians forced a referendum. Tobacco control advocates mounted a vigorous defense and the ordinance was ratified by voters in May, 2002, with 64 % voting for it. While tobacco control advocates, generally working through the voluntary health agencies, are showing increasing aggressiveness and effectiveness in working at the local level, they are still unwilling to confront the tobacco industry’s allies in the state legislature, which explains their failure to force Texas to mount a strong state tobacco control program despite the millions of dollars made available by the state’s tobacco settlement...|$|E
