5|$|We played Birmingham City in {{pre-season}} {{and he got}} {{a lovely}} ovation from their supporters and it was the same at Yeovil last year. He got a lovely clap at Northampton a few weeks ago when he was taken off. I don't think that happened by coincidence. And I've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if he comes back with another club. Supporters recognise him and they see the whole-heartedness and the commitment and the ability that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Mercedes gets held to ransom by Clare Devine (Gemma Bissix) {{and wants}} £200,000 Jacqui decides she must do {{whatever}} she {{can to help}} save her. She decides to sell a man, Trevor, an empty van supposing to have vodka in while she gets nana McQueen to sell the actual vodka for £50,000 but this plan backfires when Phoebe decides {{to go with her}} – and find five illegal immigrants in the van. Jacqui lets them free but then has her life threatened by Trevor. Jacqui gets detained by police but it's Trudy they're after so Jacqui pretends to be her. But then Trudy gets arrested for human trafficking and leaves the village. With Trevor still after her, Jacqui realises she is no longer safe in Hollyoaks and must leave. But when she finds a stash of money in the loft at Trudy's office and Trevor walks in, Jacqui is visibly scared. As he advances she manages to knock him to the floor but isn't quick enough as he gets up and grabs her but Tony comes to the rescue by smashing a monitor over his head. As Jacqui and Tony escape with the money, She kicks an unconscious Trevor and legs it. As she says an emotional goodbye to Phoebe, she has a chat with John Paul and leaves the bag at the stairs for the family to find. As Tony finds Jacqui and tells her <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> Diane O'Connor (Alexandra Fletcher) pregnant Jacqui gets upset and tells Tony It's not going to be with her and makes him stick by Diane but Tony proposes to Jacqui who turns him down and gets in the taxi leaving Tony devastated.|$|E
25|$|What <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> to {{understand}} is that we were speaking the truth for 23 years and apologies have only started to come today from them because of yesterday. It's too little, too late. It's fine to apologise afterwards. They just don't want their names in any more sleaze. No, his apology doesn't mean a thing to me.|$|E

6000|$|Lucilla and I happened, on that evening, to be {{guests at}} the rectory table. It {{was one of the}} regular {{occasions}} on which we left our own side of the house, and joined the family at (what Mr. Finch called) [...] "the pastor's evening meal." [...] <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> his wife; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> his eldest daughter; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> your humble servant. A horrid smile of enjoyment overspread the reverend gentleman's face, as he surveyed us from {{the opposite end of the}} room, and opened his vocal fire on his audience of three.|$|R

25|$|Langer impresses {{me because}} he has proven himself as a {{consistent}} batsmen {{over the past few}} years. I've always believed that it takes 3-4 years to prove yourself as a Shield batsman, and Langer has achieved that. He is more of a grafting batsman than any of his rivals and that should definitely count in his favour, given the current state of Australian batting. He probably doesn't have as much natural ability as some others around, but he has proved that he can make best use of what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got.</b> He's prepared to work hard, and has tightened his game a lot since he came into first class cricket. His ability to get his head down and his tight defence will both be strong assets in England.|$|E
25|$|Jacqui {{then begins}} working for Trudy again {{to get money}} as Mercedes is kidnapped by Clare Devine (Gemma Bissix) and Clare demands £200,000 or she will kill Mercedes. However Tony is furious when he finds this out and tells Jacqui that if she {{continues}} to work for Trudy then he will leave her and Jacqui agrees not to work for Trudy anymore. Tony then plans to propose to Jacqui although when she doesn't show up, Tony realises that she is still working for Trudy and tells her that they are over. Trudy then gives Jacqui £200,000 to release Mercedes although Trevor Royle (Greg Wood) wants this money and attempts to kill Jacqui for it. Tony then saves Jacqui and him and they plan to escape together in case Trevor comes after her. Tony is shocked when he finds out that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> Diane O'Connor (Alex Fletcher) pregnant with twins and when Jacqui hears this, she leaves Hollyoaks Village by herself. Tony then lets Diane move in with him along with her stepchildren, Sinead (Stephanie Davis) and Finn (Keith Rice).|$|E
500|$|Several {{witnesses}} were LaRouche followers who testified under immunity from prosecution. A former fundraiser {{testified that he}} was told, [...] "No matter what the person you are talking to says, get the money. [...] If you are talking to an unemployed worker who says <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> to feed ... a dozen children, forget it. Get the money. Most {{of these people are}} immoral anyway. This is the most moral thing they have ever done is to give you money." ...|$|E

500|$|Kohli {{is noted}} for his on-field {{aggression}} and {{was described in}} the media as [...] "brash" [...] and [...] "arrogant" [...] during his early career. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> into confrontations with players and umpires on several occasions. While many former cricketers have backed his aggressive attitude, some have criticised it. In 2012, Kohli had stated that he tries to limit his aggressive behaviour but [...] "the build-up and the pressure or the special occasions make it tough to control the aggression." ...|$|E
500|$|Describing Hughes's {{attributes}} in January 2013, former Notts County coach Dave Kevan {{said that}} he was a [...] "fantastic finisher... a clever player whose movement is good, whose intelligence is good, who uses his body well and who uses his strength well... he plays with his brain and he's adapted his game as <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> older... he's also clever enough to create opportunities for others". He maintained a [...] "natural goalscoring instinct" [...] throughout his career, and has said [...] "I always fancy myself to stick the ball {{in the back of the}} net if I get a chance". He ended the 2013–14 season with eight goals in 21 appearances for Rovers.|$|E

500|$|Pleased {{with his}} success in London, Clarke {{returned}} to Lisbon on [...] posing as a journalist for The Times named [...] "Wrangal Craker". His aim was {{to carry on the}} semi-undercover work of spreading rumours and misinformation to the Germans. Later that month, in Madrid, he was arrested while dressed as a woman. Guy Liddell, wartime counter-espionage head at MI5, said of the incident: [...] "I'm afraid to say that after his stay in Lisbon as a bogus journalist <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> rather over-confident about his powers as an agent." [...] Clarke was released, apparently at the behest of a German contact who believed him to be [...] "an important agent who was ready to assist the Germans", and made his way to Gibraltar.|$|E
500|$|Before Christmas in 1972, {{she met the}} then-divorced Cynthia at {{the funeral}} of Mimi's sister, Harriet, in Liverpool. Mimi sternly criticised Cynthia for divorcing Lennon—and letting him start a {{relationship}} with Yoko Ono—by saying she should have stopped him from making [...] "an idiot of himself". Even though Mimi was described as domineering, Ono later compared herself to her when describing her own relationship with Lennon. She later admitted that Ono was a good wife and mother. After Lennon's death, Ono and Sean Lennon visited Mimi in Liverpool, where she was staying at her sister Anne's house because of a heart condition. She said, [...] "Sean is like John in every way—looks and manner—and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> John's sense of humour. As long as he keeps away from music, he will be all right".|$|E
500|$|He has, at times, been criticised for {{his passing}} ability. As well {{as not being}} able to channel his {{aggression}} into a more productive manner, he has also been criticised for his disciplinary record due to his tough tackling style and his lack of goalscoring since joining Celtic. The Daily Telegraph noted in the lead-up to the 2011 Scottish Cup Final that Brown had only scored six goals in the previous two seasons, but had received eighteen yellow cards and two red cards. After captaining Scotland to an away win over Poland in March 2014, the Scotland national manager described Brown as [...] "fantastic", adding [...] "He's ungainly in a way but he does what all good midfielders do: pass the ball, keep it, move it on. But then <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> the power to win the ball back." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite his success, Homer {{notices that}} his team members are {{starting}} to get overworked. He decides that the solution is to get them hammocks and visits Scorpio to ask where he can purchase some. Scorpio begins to tell Homer of [...] "the Hammock district", but he is interrupted by some urgent business. It turns out that Scorpio is a criminal mastermind formulating a plot to take over the East Coast of the United States with a doomsday device, as he turns to a screen and threatens the United Nations Security Council by declaring that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> hold of the doomsday device and that they have 72 hours to meet his demand of gold. To prove his intent, he blows up the 59th Street Bridge. Despite being in the same room, Homer appears oblivious to Scorpio's nefarious plan as he was looking outside the window.|$|E
500|$|Diana asks Paul {{to prove}} to her how far he is {{prepared}} to go to create an alliance between them and to prove his loyalty he proposes that they sleep together. Diana suspects that Paul is not being genuine, but Paul insists that he is and describes Rebecca as [...] "collateral damage." [...] Paul believes that sleeping with Diana is the only option <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> to keep her on side. Dennis added that Paul feels guilty when he takes off his wedding ring and terrible about betraying Rebecca. Badler said that the situation is an [...] "ego thing" [...] for Diana and afterwards she makes it clear that her plans to destroy Paul have not changed. Badler said she enjoyed working with Stefan Dennis and said he is [...] "fantastic" [...] and that she felt comfortable with him. She said [...] "I kind of felt like it was a well-played tennis match – every time you zing him something, he zings it right back. He's right there for you, so I absolutely loved working with him.|$|E
500|$|In the World Championship, O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Craig Steadman 10–3 in {{the first}} round and Matthew Stevens 13–5 in the second round, but suffered a surprise 9–13 defeat to Stuart Bingham in the quarter-finals. O'Sullivan was involved in many incidents during the tournament. While playing Steadman, he breached snooker's dress code when he removed a pair of uncomfortable shoes and played briefly in his socks, before borrowing shoes from tournament director Mike Ganley. In his match with Stevens, frustrated at missing a shot, he almost snapped his cue in half by hitting it against the table. In his quarter-final match, O'Sullivan placed his chalk on the table and used it to line up a shot. Controversially, referee Terry Camilleri did not penalize him for the incident, even though many commentators, including former world champion Ken Doherty and former tour referee Michaela Tabb, argued that under the rules of snooker the referee should have called a 7-point foul. These incidents led Stephen Hendry to say that O'Sullivan was not fully focused. [...] "Personally I think it is a sign <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> other things on his mind," [...] said Hendry. [...] "He is not focused properly on winning the World Championship." ...|$|E

500|$|In Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, Clarke infuses her dry wit with prosaic quaintness. For example, {{the narrator}} notes: [...] "It has been remarked (by a lady {{infinitely}} cleverer {{than the present}} author) how kindly disposed the world in general feels to young people who either die or marry. Imagine then the interest that surrounded Miss Wintertowne! No young lady ever had such advantages before: for she died upon the Tuesday, was raised {{to life in the}} early hours of Wednesday morning, and was married upon the Thursday; which some people thought too much excitement for one week." [...] As Michel Faber explains in his review for The Guardian, [...] "here we have all the defining features of Clarke's style simultaneously: the archly Austenesque tone, the somewhat overdone quaintness ("upon the Tuesday"), the winningly matter-of-fact use of the supernatural, and drollness to spare." [...] Gregory Maguire notes in The New York Times that Clarke even gently ridicules the genre of the novel itself: [...] " [...] picks up a book and begins to read...but he is not attending to what he reads and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> to Page 22 before he discovers it is a novel– the sort of work which above all others he most despises– and he puts it down in disgust." [...] Elsewhere, the narrator remarks, [...] "Dear Emma does not waste her energies upon novels like other young women." [...] The narrator's identity has been a topic of discussion, with Clarke declaring that said narrator is female and omniscient rather than a future scholar from within the real storyline as some had suggested.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal faced West Ham United in {{the first}} weekend of October. Dixon, Nigel Winterburn and Overmars were rested for the match, {{replaced}} by Oleh Luzhny, Slyvinho and Davor Šuker. In spite of general dominance from Arsenal, West Ham striker Paolo di Canio scored in each half to win his team the match. Patrick Vieira was dismissed during play for a foul on Di Canio. A confrontation soon after occurred between the player and Neil Ruddock. Vieira was subsequently charged, banned for six matches and fined a record £45,000 by The Football Association. Šuker scored twice against Everton at Highbury on 16 October 1999. Arsenal then travelled to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea. Goals from Tore André Flo and Dan Petrescu seemed to have given the home side victory, before Kanu scored a hat-trick {{in the space of}} 15 minutes. His first involved extending his legs and stabbing the ball past goalkeeper Ed de Goey, once it fell kindly in his direction. The equaliser came in the 83rd minute: Kanu received the ball from Overmars, which took him away from goal but hit the ball to the left of De Goey’s dive. In injury time Kanu, in the downpour, chased down the ball and dribbled past the stranded Chelsea goalkeeper on the byline, before curling the ball over Frank Leboeuf and into {{the far corner of the}} goal net. Kanu's teammate Šuker described the third goal as [...] "beautiful", while Bergkamp added: [...] "The skills <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>got,</b> the moves he makes, are something you like to watch and learn from. I watch him in training and it is a joy." [...] The month ended with a goalless draw at home to Newcastle United, which left Arsenal fourth, three points behind league leaders Leeds United.|$|E
