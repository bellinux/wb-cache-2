5|$|Gandhi {{called his}} ideas Nai Talim (literally, 'new {{education}}'). <b>He</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Western style education violated and destroyed the indigenous cultures.

5|$|<b>He</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> First Amendment {{erected a}} metaphorical wall of {{separation}} {{between church and}} state.

Board of Education (1947), which held that the establishment clause was applicable not only to the federal government, but also to the states.|$|E
5|$|Nash himself {{claimed that}} he could have ended Bodyline in two overs without needing to resort to a leg field, as <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> English batsman could not hook and a few overs of sustained, fast short pitched bowling would have caused England to abandon their Bodyline tactics.|$|E
5|$|On 24 October 2007, Secretary of the Air Force Wynne {{told the}} House Armed Services Committee that <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 5th Bomb Wing could be recertified and could resume {{ferrying}} the AGM-129 cruise missiles to Barksdale for retirement. He {{did not provide}} a timeline for that recertification process. On 1 November 2007 Colonel Joel Westa took command of the 5th Bomb Wing.

5|$|On caste, <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Kural {{illustrates}} how Vedic laws of Manu were against the Sudras and other {{communities of the}} Dravidian race. On the other hand, Periyar opined that the ethics from the Kural was comparable to the Christian Bible. The Dravidar Kazhagam adopted the Thirukkural and advocated that Thiruvalluvar's Kural alone was enough to educate {{the people of the}} country.|$|E
5|$|The poem also {{contains}} many of Southey's {{views on the}} Catholic Church and how it influenced his political views. Part of this comes from Southey's trip to Lisbon and Madrid in 1795 where he was exposed to what he believed as Catholic superstition. <b>He</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> church and the Catholic leaders kept the people ignorant, and <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Muslims that were cast out of Spain were more tolerant. Many of these ideas are repeated in a speech within the work by Henry V, and the character attributes ignorance and vice to oppression. Southey believed {{that the only way}} to escape from these problems was for people to believe they were part of one universal family. His enemies later described Southey's as holding Jacobin belief and claimed he supported the extremism of Robbespierre, when his sympathies laid to a larger extent with the Girondins that were replaced by the Jacobins. However, the poem is still subversive since it described a French patriot fighting against the English that parallels the strife during Southey's time.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{contains}} Southey's {{bias against}} superstition, whether Catholic, Protestant, or pagan. <b>He</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> work itself was more historical than epic, and it contained many of Southey's political views. Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with many {{saying that there}} were beautiful scenes, but many feeling that the language fell short of being adequate for the subject matter. One review went so far to mock Southey's reliance on Welsh and Aztec names.|$|E

5|$|White {{would later}} {{confirm that the}} killings were premeditated. In 1984, he told former police Inspector Frank Falzon that not only had he planned to kill Moscone and Milk, but also had plans to kill Assemblyman Willie Brown and Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver. <b>He</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> four {{politicians}} were attempting to block his reinstatement as Supervisor.|$|E
5|$|As the Philadelphia Council's newly hired field {{executive}} in 1915, one of Goodman's assignments was {{to serve as}} director of the council's summer camp at Treasure Island Scout Reservation on the Delaware River. <b>He</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> summer camp experience should do more than just teach proficiency in Scoutcraft skills; rather, the principles embodied in the Scout Oath and Scout Law should become realities in the lives of Scouts. Along with his assistant camp director, Carroll A. Edson, he started an experimental program to recognize those Scouts best exemplifying those traits as an example to their peers.|$|E
5|$|Booth co-authored Cricket and Christianity with Paul White {{and wrote}} Hockey Fundamentals and Booth to Bat. In 1998 he wrote Sport and sportsmanship: a Christian {{perspective}} towards 2000 for the Australian Christian Forum on Education. <b>He</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> foundations of sport were courtesy and fairness, and he condemned {{the prevalence of}} verbal jousting in the modern game. During his career, Booth often spoke at religious functions {{in combination with other}} Christian cricketers. He appeared with the English Test opener Reverend David Sheppard at Sydney Town Hall and preached with Conrad Hunte in the West Indies.|$|E

5|$|Day {{focussed}} on the girls' education, in {{the style}} of Emile. He expanded on the teaching they had received from the Foundling Hospital in reading and basic arithmetic, and also taught them how to write. <b>He</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> girls should be able to manage the house, so they were charged with cooking and cleaning as well as other housework. Finally, he {{wanted to be able to}} debate complex concepts with them, so he taught them rudimentary theories in physics and geography, tasking them with observing the changing of the seasons, and recording details of sunrises and sunsets. He also imparted to them Rousseau's philosophical contempt for luxury.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though in}} his 1955 book Egypt's Destiny, Naguib wrote that his brigade's {{successful}} stand was a glorious victory with few consequences, estimating 450 Israeli dead (out of a perceived 4,000 attackers), a logbook captured by Israel {{during the war}} revealed that he was extremely worried about the future fate of his forces. He requested immediate assistance, including air support to determine {{the location of the}} Israeli cannons, a medevac unit, reinforcements, munitions and communication wires. It is also likely that <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 53rd Battalion's force blocking the road from Majdal was still in place, and therefore thought that he was surrounded.|$|E
5|$|However, Sitchin, {{who died}} in 2010, denied any {{connection}} between his work and Lieder's claims. In 2007, partly in response to Lieder's proclamations, Sitchin published a book, The End of Days, which set {{the time for the}} last passing of Nibiru by Earth at 556 BC, which would mean, given the object's supposed 3,600-year orbit, that it would return sometime around AD 2900. He did however say that <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Annunaki might return earlier by spaceship, and that the timing of their return would coincide with the shift from the astrological Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius, sometime between 2090 and 2370.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Capello {{returned}} to Milan, subsequently stating Baggio {{was not a}} part of his plans with the club. Baggio chose to move to Parma, but the manager at the time, Carlo Ancelotti, impeded the transfer, as he also did not feel Baggio would fit into his tactical plans. Ancelotti would later state he regretted this decision, stating that in his naïveté, <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 4–4–2 formation was the ideal formation for success, and he felt that at the time, creative players such as Gianfranco Zola and Baggio were not compatible with this system.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Whig {{interpretation}} of Magna Carta {{and its role}} in constitutional history remained dominant during the 19th century. The historian William Stubbs's Constitutional History of England, published in the 1870s, formed the high-water mark of this view. Stubbs argued that Magna Carta had been a major step in the shaping of the English nation, and <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> barons at Runnymede in 1215 were not just representing the nobility, but the people of England as a whole, standing up to a tyrannical ruler in the form of King John.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's works, {{especially}} his Lives of the Poets series, describe various features of excellent writing. <b>He</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> best poetry relied on contemporary language, and he disliked {{the use of}} decorative or purposefully archaic language. He was suspicious of the poetic language used by Milton, whose blank verse he believed would inspire many bad imitations. Also, Johnson opposed the poetic language of his contemporary Thomas Gray. His greatest complaint was that obscure allusions found in works like Milton's Lycidas were overused; he preferred poetry that could be easily read and understood. In addition to his views on language, Johnson believed that a good poem incorporated new and unique imagery.|$|E
