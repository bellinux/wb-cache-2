Ao se partir da premissa de que um contrato administrativo, tal como qualquer outro ato jurídico, introduz normas jurídicas no sistema jurídico-positivo, será preciso antes de tudo saber quando uma norma existe para o ordenamento jurídico, bem como quando ela será considerada válida ou inválida. Além disso, será importante apontar o sentido do termo eficácia. Em seguida, indicar-se-á o conceito de contrato administrativo a ser adotado neste trabalho, procurando analisá-lo a partir dos elementos e pressupostos do ato administrativo, o que se revelará bastante útil ao se estudar a convalidação dos contratos administrativos inválidos. Depois de se apresentar o conceito de invalidade e suas espécies no direito brasileiro, abordar-se-á as hipóteses de manutenção, no direito positivo, dos contratos administrativos inválidos, quais sejam, a convalidação, a conversão e o saneamento.

40|$|In {{the first}} book of the Transcendental Dialectic we find Kant’s {{criticism}} of four syllogistic proofs about the soul. On his view the proofs are <b>formally</b> <b>invalid.</b> Hence, {{as opposed to the}} view of their proponents – the rational psychologists – the inferences do not establish: (i) that the soul is a substance; (ii) that the soul is simple; (iii) that the soul is a person; (iv) that the soul can exist independently of material beings. Kant calls these fallacious proofs transcendental paralogisms. The second paralogism, as presented and discussed by Kant in the A-edition of the KrV, is particularly intriguing and difficult. It is particularly intriguing because it is the most powerful and convincing of the paralogisms. It is to wit “the Achilles of all the dialectical inferences of the pure doctrine of the soul, nothing like a mere sophistical play that a dogmatist devised in order to give his assertions a fleeting plausibility, but an inference that seems to withstand even the sharpest testing and the greatest scruples of inquiry. ” (KrV A 351) It is particularly difficult because Kant’s dismissal of it is notoriously complex and suggests that the rational psychologist makes a number of quite different kinds of mistakes. Thus it is unclear how Kant’s critique of the second paralogism in the A-edition is supposed to fits with his general description of a transcendental paralogism in the same edition. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show that one can nevertheless extract a line of criticism against the rational psychologist, which shows that the rational psychologist involves himself in a formal fallacy that accords with the general description of a transcendental paralogism. My argument will be developed in five steps. In the first step I argue that both of the two standard ways of rendering the logical form of the second paralogism in the A-edition are problematic since they overlook that the middle term of the proof involves a negation. Since for Kant negation can be of two kinds: finite or infinite, I present the hypothesis that the second paralogism is a <b>formally</b> <b>invalid</b> inference because of an ambiguity pertaining to the logical operation of negation. In the second step, I present the historical background of infinite negation and Kant’s version of it. In both versions, the crucial difference is that only mere negation (i. e., negative judgment in Kant’s parlor) is compatible with empty terms. In the third step, I use the distinction between negative and infinite judgment to present four different possible interpretations of the second paralogism. In the fourth step, I argue that according to Kant’s reconstruction of the rational psychologist’s argument he (the rational psychologist) in fact helps himself to a valid form of the proof that has an infinite judgment in the Minor. I then suggest that Kant’s critique of the rational psychologist is that he is not justified in using this valid form. Thus, contrary to his own assumption, the rational psychologist has at his disposal only the <b>formally</b> <b>invalid</b> form of the inference with a negative Minor. In the fifth step, I first show that my reading accords with Kant’s general description of a transcendental paralogism. I then argue that the error which underlies and indeed conceals the syllogistic fallacy, is that the rational psychologist assumes but has not shown that the soul as an object of pure rational psychology exists...|$|R
50|$|The inverse gambler's fallacy {{is unquestionably}} a fallacy, {{but there is}} {{disagreement}} over whether and {{where it has been}} committed in practice. In his original paper, Hacking takes as his main example a certain response to the argument from design. The argument from design asserts, first, that the universe is fine tuned to support life, and second, that this fine tuning points to the existence of an intelligent designer. The rebuttal attacked by Hacking consists of accepting the first premise, but rejecting the second on the grounds that our (big bang) universe is just one in a long sequence of universes, and that the fine tuning merely shows that there have been many other (poorly tuned) universes preceding this one. Hacking draws a sharp distinction between this argument and the argument that all possible worlds coexist in some non-temporal sense. He proposes that these arguments, often treated as minor variations of one another, should be considered fundamentally different because one is <b>formally</b> <b>invalid</b> while the other is not.|$|R

40|$|Mixing in the abyssal {{ocean is}} known to play an {{important}} role in controlling the large-scale ocean circulation. In the search for sources of mechanical energy for mixing, internal tides generated by the interaction of the barotropic tide with bottom topography (mode conversion) have been implicated. However, estimates of the rate at which barotropic tidal energy is converted into the internal wave field are quite uncertain. Here, I present analytical and numerical calculations of internal tide generation in a fluid layer of finite depth to better understand the energetics of the wave generation process. Previous theoretical models of wave generation have assumed an upper radiation boundary condition (BC) appropriate for an ocean of infinite depth. But recent observations of internal tides at significant distances from their generation region indicate that this BC is not always valid, and that reflection from the upper surface is important. I show that the presence of an upper free-surface reduces the rate at which energy is fed into the internal wave field (the power) and thus the energy available for mixing. This reduction increases with the horizontal extent of the topography (relative to the wavelength of a mode- 1 internal wave). Fully nonhydrostatic, nonlinear numerical calculations are used to both test the theory and to explore more realistic parameters for which linear theories are <b>formally</b> <b>invalid.</b> As bottom topography becomes steeper, linear theory underestimates mode conversion by an increasing amount, although even at critical slope the difference is quite small (O(20 %)).

It was a claim made for ecclesiastical purposes, as it was required by {{the traditions of the}} Church of England. The Letters Patent also established St Saviour's Church as the Cathedral Church of the diocese. This was the last instance in which Letters Patent were used in this manner in the British Empire, as they had been significantly discredited for use in the colonies, and were soon to be declared <b>formally</b> <b>invalid</b> and unenforceable in this context. [...] Several legal cases over the preceding decade in particular had already established that the monarch had no ecclesiastical jurisdiction in colonies possessing responsible government.

Changes concern both defects and remedies. Along with traditional defects provided for by the civil code (i. e. incapacity, mistake, duress, and fraudolent misrepresentation), new rules have introduced protections to safeguard the weak contracting party’s carefulness, freedom and information. New duties to inform are placed on businesses in contracts negotiated away from business premises; distance selling, distance selling of financial services, and timeshare contracts; contracts for the purchase of package holidays; consumer credit, and electricity and gas supply contracts, {{as well as in the}} labelling of non-food products, and in the sale of dangerous products.

40|$|Aims. The {{determination}} of {{the location of the}} theoretical ZZ Ceti instability strip in the log g − Teff diagram has remained a challenge over the years {{due to the lack of}} a suitable treatment for convection in these stars. For the first time, a full nonadiabatic approach including time-dependent convection is applied to ZZ Ceti pulsators, and we provide the appropriate details related to the inner work- ings of the driving mechanism at work. Methods. We used the nonadiabatic pulsation code MAD with a representative evolutionary sequence of a 0. 6 M⊙ DA white dwarf. This sequence is made of state-of-the-art models that include a detailed modeling of the feedback of convection on the atmospheric structure. The assumed convective efficiency in these models is the so-called ML 2 /α = 1. 0 version. We also carried out, for comparison purposes, nonadiabatic computations within the frozen convection approximation, as well as calculations based on models with standard grey atmospheres. Results. We find that pulsational driving in ZZ Ceti stars is concentrated at the base of the superficial H convection zone, but at depths, near the blue edge of the instability strip, somewhat larger than those obtained with the frozen convection approach. Despite the fact that this approach is <b>formally</b> <b>invalid</b> in such stars, particularly near the blue edge of the instability strip, the predicted boundaries are not dramatically different in both cases. The revised blue edge for a 0. 6 M⊙ model is found to be around Teff = 11, 970 K, some 240 K hotter than the value predicted within the frozen convection approximation, in rather good agreement with the empirical value. On the other hand, our predicted red edge temperature for the same stellar mass is only about 5600 K (80 K hotter than with the frozen convection approach), much lower than the observed value. Conclusions. We correctly understand the development of pulsational instabilities of a white dwarf as it cools at the blue edge of the ZZ Ceti instability strip. Our current implementation of time-dependent convection however still lacks important ingredients to fully account for the observed red edge of the strip. We will explore a number of possibilities in the future papers of this series. Peer reviewe...|$|R
