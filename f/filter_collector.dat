40|$|Over {{the past}} decade {{increasing}} concern over the potential environmental impact associated with the emissions of both gaseous and particulate pollutants {{has resulted in the}} promulgation of strict regulatory standards governing such emissions. In this regard, particular attention has been placed upon the control of sulfur dioxide (SO 2) from major fuel burning installations. The provisions of the 1977 Amendments to the Clean Air Act which relate to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) have made consideration of this problem of significant additional importance in the context of increased coal utilization. There exist three general methods for the control of sulfur dioxide emissions from pulverized coal-fired boiler equipment. These are: (1) coal cleaning to remove pyritic sulfur, (2) conventional wet, nonregenerable scrubbing with alkaline slurry and solution processes, and (3) dry processes which involve direct introduction of lime or limestone into the firebox, or a spray dryer operated with nonregenerable alkaline sorbents coupled with a fabric <b>filter</b> <b>collector.</b> Equipment requirements, SO 2 removal criteria, general economics, and potential applications of these latter two approaches within category (3) will be discussed...|$|E

In various studies, {{the effects of}} fumes, gases, and vapors on workers and environment have been proved. Meanwhile, cutting alloying plates with plasma cutting machine due to containing various alloy materials produces a lot of air pollution. Therefore, using the ventilation system to remove the mentioned pollution has always been noteworthy. Method: This study was performed on plasma cutting machine at Mobarakeh Steel Company. At first, according to ASTM the elements from alloy plates with optical emission spectrometry crm- 35000 -quantometery were detected, the air pollution from cutting the mentioned plates was sampled and measured using NIOSH 7300 method {{and according to the}} ACGIH:VS- 72 - 20, VS- 70 - 12, VS- 70 - 11 VS- 916 push-pull ventilation with bag <b>filter</b> <b>collector</b> was designed.

These species belong to three functional feeding groups: scrapers, <b>filtering</b> <b>collectors</b> and shredders. The abundance and species richness were not affected by water quality, but habitat quality related to presence of riparian vegetation had positive effects on the abundance of shredders.

In order to investigate changes in the taxa abundance composition and feeding groups of the benthic macroinvertebrates, twelve-time sampling was carried out at nine stations along three different sites: (1) before, (2) into, and (3) after Amol City. Results showed impacts of anthropogenic activities caused by the urbanization and development on the occurrence of benthic macroinvertebrates taxa.

40|$|Understanding organic aerosol (OA) {{sources and}} {{secondary}} OA (SOA) formation {{is crucial to}} elucidate their human health and climate change effects, but has been limited by lack of instrumentation capable of in-situ measurements of organic speciation in the atmosphere across the vapor pressure range of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and OA. This dissertation describes 1) {{the development of a}} novel instrument based on a thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatograph (TAG), called semi-volatile TAG (SV-TAG) which enables quantitative measurements of specific chemical tracers in SVOCs and OA and 2) application of this new instrument to investigate the various source contributions to OA and SOA formation. The development of the SV-TAG was initiated by employing a denuder difference method to improve the capability of the TAG for quantitative gas/particle separation. Using this technique, hourly time resolution in-situ measurements of organic species were made and then used to investigate the pathways of gas-to-particle partitioning for oxygenated compounds and particle-phase organics were used for source apportionment calculations. The measurements of gas/particle partitioning of phthalic acid, pinonaldehyde and 6, 10, 14 -trimethyl- 2 -pentadecanone were explored to elucidate the pathways of gas-to-particle partitioning whereby SOA was formed. The observations show that multiple pathways of gas-to-particle partitioning contribute to formation of SOA in the atmosphere and the dominance of different pathways are compound-dependent. Absorption into particles is shown to be the dominant pathway for 6, 10, 14 -trimethyl- 2 -pentadecanone to contribute to SOA in Bakersfield, CA. The major pathway to form particle-phase phthalic acid is likely attributed to formation of condensable salts through reactions between phthalic acid and gas-phase ammonia. The observations of pinonaldehyde in particles while inorganic acids in particles were fully neutralized suggest that the occurrence of reactive uptake of pinonaldehyde onto particles does not require the presence of inorganic acids. The relationship between particle-phase pinonaldehyde and RH suggests that aerosol water content plays {{a significant role in the}} formation of particle-phase pinonaldehyde. To investigate the contributions of various sources to OA in Bakersfield, CA, positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis was performed on a subset of the measured particle-phase organic compounds. Six OA source factors were identified, including one representing primary organic aerosol (POA), four different types of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) representing local, regional, and nighttime production, and one representing a complex mixture of additional OA sources that were not further resolvable. POA accounted for 15 % of OA on average with a significant contribution from local vehicles. SOA was the dominant contributor to OA, accounting for on average 72 % of OA. The rest of OA was unresolved as a mixture of OA sources. Both local and regional SOA had a significant contribution to OA during the day but regional SOA was the largest contributor to OA during the afternoon. SOA formed from the oxidation of biogenic SOA precursors substantially contributed to OA at night. The absorption of organic compounds into particles is suggested to be the major pathway to form SOA, although other pathways also played significant roles. To achieve quantitative collection of SVOCs following improved gas/particle separation, a new collection and thermal desorption system was developed with the key component being a passivated metal fiber <b>filter</b> <b>collector.</b> This final configuration of the SV-TAG enabled in-situ quantitative measurements of speciated SVOCs with vapor pressures lower than n-tetradecane (C 14). The capability for measurements of gas/particle partitioning was demonstrated by measurements of n-alkanes in both gas and particle phases. Organic tracers in both gas and particle phases can be quantified. Percentages of speciated organic compounds in total measured organics can be estimated. For example, ~ 7 % and less than 1 % of total measured organics in the same retention range of n-alkanes (C 14 -C 20) in the atmosphere in Berkeley, CA were accounted for by the sum of measured n-alkanes (C 14 -C 20) and the sum of n alkylcyclohexanes (C 14 -C 20). The SV-TAG has been demonstrated to enable investigation of the pathways of gas-to-particle partitioning and source apportionment of OA with hourly time resolution. The SV-TAG is also capable of quantitative measurements of speciated SVOCs, defining their gas/particle partitioning in-situ for the first time, and providing observational constraints on the abundance of SVOCs with which to investigate their primary emissions, chemical transformation, and fate...|$|E

Species composition patterns were mainly influenced by both the gradient of physicochemical variables (e. g., altitude, slope, conductivity) {{and the proportion of}} forest area. Community structure patterns were further correlated to the proportion of urbanization and to biological indices (e. g., diversity, number of species). Land use preferences of benthic species were identified based on the indicator values and weighted averaging regression models. Plecoptera species were representative of undisturbed streams in forest areas, whereas Tubificidae species and <b>filtering</b> <b>collector</b> caddis flies were indicator taxa in severely polluted and agricultural areas, respectively.

Despite many attempts to include the crenic fauna in the classification of springs, there is no faunistic crenon typology. Over a three-year period we investigated the macroinvertebrate assemblages and the physical, chemical and ecomorphological conditions of 82 springs in the Swiss Jura Mountains, north-western Switzerland. Based on these data we selected the 25 least-disturbed springs to develop a faunistic crenon classification. Based on functional feeding groups we differentiated three crenon groups. An analysis of similarities and nonmetric multidimensional scaling for the substratum types supported the crenon groupings. In general we can distinguish between springs that are dominated by scrapers and characterized by a lotic environment, {{and those that are}} mostly inhabited by <b>filtering</b> <b>collectors,</b> associated with a lentic environment. Those two crenon types are the extremes of a continuum. Particular crenon forms, such as those with extensive carbonate deposits, lie between these extremes. This third group is characterized by gathering collectors and shredders. Using this approach we can distinguish faunistic crenon types, based on functional feeding groups, which reflect the abiotic conditions within the springs. We provide a foundation for a faunistic crenon typology which now can be tested in other landscapes and will then be applicable to other low mountain ranges in Europe...|$|R

40|$|Over {{fifty years}} of {{research}} on freshwater macroinvertebrates has been driven largely {{by the state of}} the taxonomy of these organisms. Significant advances have been and continue to be made in developing ever more refined keys to macroinvertebrate groups. When advances in macroinvertebrate ecological research are restricted by the level of detail in identifications, then analysis by function is a viable alternative. The focus on function, namely adaptations of macroinvertebrates to habitats and the utilization of food resources, has facilitated ecological evaluation of freshwater ecosystems. This classification is based not on what insects eat, but how they obtain their food. These categories are called 'functional feeding groups', as the name implies, denoting their functional role when describing how and where they feed. This is the basis for the functional feeding group (FFG) method that was initially developed in the early 1960 s. Taxonomy is applied only to the level of detail that allows assignment to one of five functional feeding group categories: detrital shredders, scrapers, <b>filtering</b> <b>collectors,</b> gatherers, and predators. The aim of this short communication, originating from the presentation of R. W.

The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the composition and structure of benthic and drift, upstream and downstream of the Achiras dam before and after construction. Sampling of benthos (Surber nets, 0. 09 m 2 and 300 μ) and drift (nets 1 m long, 300 μ and 0. 0192 m 2) were performed in high water and low water periods. The organisms were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and benthic Feeding Functional Groups were identified. Density, taxonomic richness, Shannon diversity and evenness for benthos and drift were calculated. Data were compared by three-way ANOVAs. The structure of both assemblages varied spatially and temporally. Benthic community showed a total of 110 taxa, corresponding to 8 phyla, while drift assemblage 55 taxa corresponding to 6 phyla. In both assemblages, the phylum Arthropoda was the most abundant. In the site below the dam and in the post-construction period, the benthos richness was greater, while drift evenness exhibited the highest value at the site below the dam during low water period. The <b>filtering</b> <b>collectors</b> and scrapers showed significant differences between year, site and hydrological period. The chironomids Tanytarsus sp. and Rheotanytarsus sp. were the most abundant among <b>collectors</b> while <b>filtering</b> Camelobaetidius penai and Stenophysa sp. among the scrapers.

Data-rich restoration experiments offer {{opportunities to}} test the ability of bioassessment tools, such as those currently {{used to assess the}} ‘ecological status’ of waterbodies targeted by the European Water Framework Directive, to detect observed ecological changes. 2. Minimum flow increases in four regulated reaches of the French Rho^ne River modified the inverte- brate and fish communities in a predictable way, as detailed in other articles of this Special Issue. We tested the ability of several fish and macroinvertebrate metrics currently used in bioassessment to detect these changes. In addition, we considered changes in metrics that are expected to respond specifically to flow increase. These metrics were related to the habitat requirements of species, the ecological specialisation of communities and the abundance of macroinvertebrate functional groups (seen as surrogates for ecosystem attributes). 3. For invertebrate communities, bioassessment metrics based on richness had equivocal responses to restoration and the Potamon-Type Index demonstrated no or contradictory responses to restoration. The French biotic index was not sensitive to restoration and instead depicted spatial differences in biological quality. For fish communities, the French fish index was marginally sensitive in the reach with the largest minimum flow increase and some of its metrics were sensitive in other reaches. 4. Contrasting with commonly used bioassessment indices and metrics, several metrics related to habitat requirements appropriately indicated the observed changes in community structure. Large flow changes increased the proportion of fish and macroinvertebrate individuals with preferences for midstream habitats, fast currents, deep waters and/or coarse substrates. However, these changes did not translate into the expected increase in ecological specialisation. In addition, functional metrics indicated that restoration led to higher proportions of grazers and higher availability of suspended food for <b>filtering</b> <b>collectors,</b> suggesting a return to the ecological conditions of a large river. 5.

The forest fire caused energy which entered into the river changed from allochtonous coarse particulat organic matter (CPOM) to fine particulat organic matter (FPOM).

This study describes the settlement patterns of brachyuran crabs at Ponta Rasa mangrove swamp, Inhaca Island, in order to assess if settlement patterns reflect adult distribution. Hoghair <b>filter</b> <b>collectors</b> were deployed at different strata within the mangrove, and at the adjacent intertidal flat as control. Sampling was conducted daily for a period of 82 days. The collected megalopae were reared in the laboratory to assess their moulting competency and to enable identification. Settlement intensity was tested for association with wind stress, from different directions and averaged over time lags up to 6 days. A total of 960 megalopae settled during this study. Only 8 % of the megalopae that settled at the control site belonged to mangrove dwelling species. Settlers inside Ponta Rasa swamp were exclusively mangrove species. Ilyograpsus paludicola settled mainly among Rhizophora mucronata and the mixed area of Ceriops tagal and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, where adults occur, and Perisesarma guttatum, the most abundant sesarmid at Ponta Rasa, settled mainly at the creek. Neosarmatium meinerti settled among Avicennia marina pnematophores, very close to the adult populations. Megalopae of mangrove taxa that settled outside the mangrove took longer to moult than the ones settling inside the swamp. In the intertidal areas of the mangrove, settlers took an average of 1 – 2 days to moult, whereas in subtidal areas time to moult was on an average 3 – 5 days. Thus, both distribution of settlers and moulting competency suggest that settling follows adult distribution. Tides have a strong influence on settlement at Ponta Rasa, with the effect that, due to the high sill at the entrance, neap tides do not penetrate the mangrove. The analysis of settlement data suggested a significant effect of wind-driven transport on onshore migration. There is however no obvious interpretation for the pattern observed.

40|$|Over {{the last}} fifty years, {{research}} on freshwater macroinvertebrates has been driven largely {{by the state of}} the taxonomy of these animals. In the great majority of studies conducted during the 2000 s macroinvertebrates have been operationally defined by investigators as invertebrates retained by a 250 μ mesh in field sampling devices. Significant advances have been and continue to be made in developing ever more refined keys to macroinvertebrate groups. The analysis by function is a viable alternative when advances in macroinvertebrate ecological research is restricted by the level of detail in identifications. Focus on function, namely adaptations of macroinvertebrates to habitats and the utilization of food resources, has facilitated ecological evaluation of freshwater ecosystems (Functional feeding groups; FFG). As the great stream ecologist Noel Hynes observed, aquatic insects around the world exhibit similar morphologies and behaviors, even though they are in very different taxonomic groups. This is the basis for the FFG analysis that was initially developed in the early 1970 s. FFG analysis applies taxonomy only to the level of detail that allows assignment to one of six FFG categories: scrapers adapted to feed on periphyton, detrital shredders adapted to feed on coarse (CPOM) riparian-derived plant litter that has been colonized by microbes, herbivore shredders that feed on live, rooted aquatic vascular plants, <b>filtering</b> <b>collectors</b> adapted to remove fine particle detritus (FPOM) from the water column, gathering collectors adapted to feed on FPOM where it is deposited on surfaces or in crevices in the sediments, and predators that capture live prey. The interacting roles of these FFGs in stream ecosystems were originally depicted in a conceptual model. Thus, there are a limited number of adaptations exhibited by stream macroinvertebrates that exploit these habitats and food resources. This accounts for the wide range of macroinvertebrate taxa in freshwater ecosystems found in different geographical settings that are represented by a much smaller number of FFGs. An example of the generality of the functional group concept is the presence of detrital shredders that are dependent upon riparian plant litter inputs being found in essentially all forested streams world-wide (e. g., across the USA and Canada, Chile, Brazil, West Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Thailand; Cummins, unpublished). Freshwater macroinvertebrate taxonomic determinations, especially at the species level, may be the best basis for developing specific indices of pollution (tolerance values in ecological tables). However, the FFG method appears to provide better indicators of overall freshwater ecosystem condition. </p...|$|R

OSHA's grain handling standard requires that belts for these bucket elevators purchased after March 30, 1988 are conductive and have a surface electrical resistance not exceeding 300 megohms. Bucket elevators must have an opening to the head pulley section and boot section to allow for inspection, maintenance, and cleaning. Bearings must be mounted externally to the leg casing or the employer must provide vibration, temperature, or other monitoring of the conditions of the bearings if the bearings are mounted inside or partially inside the leg casing.

Initial penetration and initial pressure drop (after 180 s) were measured and compared for different variables used in this study.

A removal efficiency of more than 99 % was obtained. The results show that 0. 4 % of cement dust still adheres on the quartz sand bed after 5 min of cleaning cycle. The presence of 0. 4 % of pre-load dust on the quartz sand filter enhanced the efficiency and low initial penetration, moderate initial pressure drop was obtained. At given Empty Bed Contact Time (EBCT), with different filter diameters 30 and 15 cm, a sharp decrease in initial penetration from 0. 41 - 0. 03 was obtained respectively. A nonlinear relationship between penetration and temperature was found. The initial penetration can be reduced by using smaller <b>filter</b> diameter, small <b>collector</b> size and collector with pre-load dust with 0. 4 %. The experiment that operates at a filter diameter of 15 cm and temperature of 25 Â°C represent the minimum penetration among all the experiments...|$|R
40|$|At the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE) {{the use of}} Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to aid the {{digitisation}} {{process has}} been investigated. This was tested using a herbarium specimen digitisation process with two stages of data entry. Records were initially batch-processed to add data extracted from the OCR text prior to being sorted based on Collector and/or Country. Using images of the specimens, a team of six digitisers then added data to the specimen records. To investigate whether the data from OCR aid the digitisation process, they completed a series of trials which compared the efficiency of data entry between sorted and unsorted batches of specimens. A survey was carried out to explore {{the opinion of the}} digitisation staff to the different sorting options. In total 7, 200 specimens were processed. When compared to an unsorted, random set of specimens, those which were sorted based on data added from the OCR were quicker to digitise. Of the methods tested here, the most successful in terms of efficiency used a protocol which required entering data into a limited set of fields and where the records were <b>filtered</b> by <b>Collector</b> and Country. The survey and subsequent discussions with the digitisation staff highlighted their preference for working with sorted specimens, in which label layout, locations and handwriting are likely to be similar, and so a familiarity with the Collector or Country is rapidly established...|$|R
40|$|Cathode erosion {{under the}} action of an {{electric}} arc {{is a major problem}} in plasma torches. The reduction of cathode erosion through the development of superior cathode materials would result in more economical operation of plasma torches. Carbon nanotubes have favorable electron emission properties; they are studied here for the fabrication of superior cathode materials. In this work, the growth of carbon nanotubes (CNT) using thermal CVD is studied on different metal and metal alloy electrodes. Electroless Ni coated on Monel substrates and Ni deposited Si wafer substrates with 20 nm Cr under layer gave the highest density of CNT growth. Variations of the CNT coverage density was observed when varying the surface roughness on pure Ni and Monel with various degree of polishing prior to the CNT growth. Cupro-Nickel alloys and electroless Ni plated Cu did not show to be favorable for the growth of CNT. Tests on the growth of CNT in a PECVD reactor were not successful; the transport of the carbon precursor to the electrodes still needs further study. Other applications {{such as the use of}} the CNT layer as a nanoparticle <b>filter</b> and <b>collector,</b> the formation of a CNT-nanoparticle composite film, the growth of a 3 D structure of a multi-branched CNT, and the growth of CNT on alloy meshes were also studied and discussed in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|Deterioration in {{the filter}} removal {{efficiency}} of submicron particles (l/l 0) under unfavorable surface conditions {{is affected by}} the number of deposited particles per filter grain. In the case of above micron particles, the deterioration of filter removal efficiency has been mainly due to the blocking effect of deposited particles and not by the number of deposited particles. Deposition of large numbers of submicron particles changed the surface characteristics of <b>collectors</b> (<b>filter</b> grain associated with deposited particles) and enhanced unfavorable surface conditions. Filtration experiments were conducted with monodispersed suspensions of known sizes of submicron latex particles at different ionic strengths, using glass beads as filter grains. The filtration performance was predicted using a mathematical model assuming a linear relationship between L/L 0 and s (i. e. L/L 0 = 1 -ks). For both particles, k was found to decrease and l 0 was found to increase with the increase in the ionic strength. Charge accumulation on the filter grain for deposition of submicron particles was calculated and was found significant at all the ionic strengths studied. For monodispersed suspensions of 0. 816 um particles, charge accumulation was found to decrease with the increase in the ionic strength of the suspensions. A comparison was made on the relative importance of blocking effect and charge accumulation for the filtration of submicron particles. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor some years, the {{degradation}} of homes by the dry rot fungus Serpula lacrymans increased. This study described, for the first time, the fungal contamination in homes located in Low–Normandy (France) and damaged by Serpula lacrymans. Wood–decaying fungi, airborne molds, fungal species growing on building materials were investigated by cultural and molecular methods. Mycotoxins in the air were quantified by HPLC–MS/MS and the mutagenicity of fungal aerosols was also evaluated using the Ames test. The results showed that Serpula lacrymans was detected {{in the air for}} one third of homes with sometimes the co–occurrence of other ligninolytic basidiomycetes species like Donkioporia expansa. Various molds in the air and on materials (117 and 103 species, respectively) were also identified indicating the complexity of indoor mycoflora. Certain recurrent species like Aspergillus versicolor and Penicillium fellutanum were observed both on building materials and in the air. The presence of cellulolytic molds in fungal aerosols and on building materials could be used as an indicator of home degradation. Airborne culturable fungal levels were measured up to 5. 8 x 105 Colony Forming Units (CFU) per cubic meter of the air (CFU/m 3) depending on the home. Fungal concentrations also depended on the type of <b>collector</b> (<b>filter</b> or liquid) and were significantly correlated with the median of particles between 2 – 15 μm in size. Two mycotoxins (alternariol and/or ochratoxin A) were observed in 4 homes but no mutagenic activity was found...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} content of oxygenated and nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OPAHs and NPAHs) in airborne particulate matter (PM 2. 5 and PM 10), and tree barks. For PM 2. 5 and PM 10 collection different approaches were followed using different type of <b>filters</b> and sample <b>collectors.</b> Samples of PM 2. 5 were collected on glass fiber filters during one month with a medium volume sampler. For PM 10, glass and quartz fiber filters were used and samples were collected simultaneously for one week using a high volume sampler. In addition, bark samples were collected at the same sites. Ultra high performance liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-APCI-MS/MS) was used for PAHs derivatives quantification. Data acquisition under MS/MS was achieved by applying multiple reaction monitoring to provide {{a high degree of}} sensitivity and specificity. Chromatographic separation was performed on a reverse phase rapid resolution column using a gradient mode (total run time: 5. 0 min). The study evidenced that in airborne particles matter, four PAHs derivatives were detected at concentrations from 0. 01 to 240. 62 ng m- 3 (or 0. 3 µg g- 1 to 30 mg g- 1). Meanwhile, in tree barks, only OPAHs were detected at concentrations varying from 0. 18 to 0. 72 µg g- 1. Fil: Fujiwara, Fabián Guillermo. Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas.

40|$|Land use {{change is}} an {{important}} human force causing modifications in the structure and quality of freshwater ecosystems worldwide. Multiple stressors have affected the Ayuquila-Armeria River in Jalisco, the third largest rivers and second in biodiversity in that Mexican state. Despite an on-going monitoring program focused on water quality, no evidence exists on how land use activities have affected its aquatic communities. I characterized the invertebrate and fish communities using the functional feeding group approach. Abundance, functional diversity, richness, and pollution tolerance were compared spatially and temporally using various multivariate metrics and were related to water chemical variables. Stable carbon and nitrogen analyses, and trace metal characterization were performed to biological and sediment samples from 17 sites in this River to determine sources of organic matter and to look for associations with surrounding land uses. <b>Filter</b> and gatherer <b>collector</b> invertebrates and fish omnivores dominated the community composition, which reflected the amount of suspended sediments in the water column. The presence of exotic species, fecal coliforms and total nitrogen above Mexican guidelines, were additional evidence of disturbance that contrasts the quality given by biotic indices. Spatial differences in diversity and composition were significant between agricultural and forested sites. Surrounding agricultural vegetation did not influence the d 13 C values in river components which were influenced by either riparian vegetation or autochthonous carbon sources, while d 15 N values in sediment and animal tissues confirmed the influence sewage and animal-derived organic matter has in the river 2 ̆ 7 s structure.

40|$|The {{provision}} {{of drinking water}} {{turns out to be}} one of the great challenges for the future because central water supply systems cannot technically or logistically be implemented. FogHive©'s main aim is stopping desertification by repairing endangered fog oases ecosystems, and harvesting water for drinking and irrigation and fostering potential inhabitation in many arid coasts such as Chile, Peru and others latitudes. FogHive© is resilient to different climatic contexts and can dynamically response to the different and intermittent prevailing wind directions by keeping the screen ratio of 1 : 1 or 1 : 2. It is an adaptable and lightweight design with emphasis in optimal frame types, forms, structural and surface sizes, structural and constructional specifications made with aluminium, galvanised steel or timber. FogHive© employs hydrophobic meshes and a deployable space-frame to intersect atmospheric water and then harvest it for drinking and irrigation. FogHive© has been tested throughout climatic simulations in the fog oasis of Alto Patache, Atacama Desert (2010). It also performs like a shading/cooling device and a soil humidifier for greenery or crop. Being a transformable construction, it can easily be transported and installed. Its footprint is hexagonal (6 m side) which is resistant against strong winds and ‘aerodynamic’ to the landscape. FogHive© consists of a water-repellent skin facing prevailing winds and a shading device facing the Equator. The water <b>collector,</b> <b>filtering</b> and irrigation network considers local structural materials and techniques. Regarding conventional two-dimensional fog collection, FogHive© upgrades the following aspects: 1. Increasing rate and yield of advection fog by taking into account harvesting rate and climatic parameters; 2. Structural reinforcement of fog collectors through lightweight and deployable space-frames; 3. Reducing installation and maintenance of fog collection; 4. Lowering physical impacts on surrounding...|$|R
40|$|The {{filtration}} Of SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 particles {{with average}} sizes of 4 and 40 mu m using a fluidized bed filter at 40 and 300 degrees C was studied. The collection mechanisms, interparticle forces and bounce-off effect between <b>filtered</b> particles and <b>collectors</b> were analyzed {{to determine their}} effect on particle filtration. Experimental {{results showed that the}} collection efficiency of 4 mu m SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 particles exceeded that of 40 mu m particles. Contrarily, the 40 mu m Fe 2 O 3 Particles were collected more efficiently than the 4 mu m particles, because {{of the differences between the}} microstructures of SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, and Fe 2 O 3 particles. The interaction between the particles affected the removal of mixed SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3. The particle size distribution (PSD) of the particles in the exit was governed by the operating temperature, the original size of the filtered particles. the interparticle force and the hardness of the particles and the collectors. The smallest particles were not those most easily elutriated from the fluidized bed filter because they agglomerated with each other or with large particles. The van der Waal's force dominated the forces between 4 and 40 mu m particles. The main collection mechanism for 4 and 40 mu m particles was direct interception. The effect of impaction increased with particle size above 40 mu m. The strong impaction and bounce-off effect reduced the collection efficiency of 40 mu m SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 particles. However, the strong interparticle force between Fe 2 O 3 particles and collectors contributed to the high collection efficiency of the Fe 2 O 3 particles. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Background/Aim. Trabeculectomy is a {{filtering}} antiglaucoma surgery {{performed to}} facilitate {{the formation of a}} drainage channel for the aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye to the subconjunctival space making a <b>collector,</b> <b>filtering</b> cushion of the eye liquid. The cause of unfavourable outcome of trabeculectomy is episcleral fibrosis which leads to the obstruction of the drainage channel. Inflammatory reaction is an initial, but, also, the key event in the process of fibrosis and directly proportional to it. A successful medicamentous suppression of inflammation could stop fibrosis. Arccordingly, the aim {{of this study was to}} comparatively evaluate suppressing effects of capecitabine and 5 -fluoroaracil upon inflammation, an initial fibrosis process after trabeculectomy. Methods. This study was performed on an experimental animal model, namely 24 rabbits (48 eyes), which were exposed to artificial cause of the tissue changes analogous to human subclinical inflammation. During the trabeculectomy, a 5 % solution of 5 - fluoroaracil was applied to the right eye sclera of a rabbit, while 2 % solution of kapecitabine was applied to the left eye sclera, thus making possible to evaluate the effects of different drugs to the same animal. Two weeks after the surgery the subconjunctival - episcleral tissue cuts were analyzed. Semiquantitative histologic test was used to compare the cellular elements of inflammatory (fibroblasts, mononuclears, plasmocytes, eosinophiles), as well as fibrosing (colagen, reticulin fibers) process, and, based on the differences in histopathologic score, suppressive efficacy of 5 -fluoroaracil and kapecitabine was evaluated and compared between the groups of the treated tissues. The results were shown as mean values ± standard deviation. Results. A statistically significantly lower score was revealed in the initial inflammatory cells - mononuclears and plasmocytes in the group of the tissues treated with kapecitabine, while there was no differences between the groups in the score of fibroblasts and colagen fibers. Conclusion. The suppression of the initial episcleral fibrosis process obtained by kapecitabine was more significant as compared to the suppression obtained by 5 -fluoroaracil, thus providing more favorable outcome of the trabeculectomy. ...|$|R
40|$|Benthic macroinvertebrates (aquatic insects) were {{collected}} from the Rio Grande upstream and downstream of Los Alamos Canyon (LAC), a major drainage that crosses Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) lands in northern New Mexico, USA. LAC contains legacy waste, including radionuclides and polychlorinated biphenyls, and occasionally discharges storm water and snowmelt flows to the Rio Grande. The Rio Grande is the major waterway that flows southward across the state. In 2009, rock baskets were placed in waters 61 - to 76 -cm-deep within each reach (five per reach), and, after approximately 6 weeks of colonization, the rock baskets were retrieved. All samples were sorted completely and organisms were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. Both reaches in 2009 were dominated by the <b>collector</b> <b>filtering</b> net-spinning caddisfly, Hydropsyche occidentalis. In 2011, benthic macroinvertebrates {{were collected}} using D kick nets from shallow riffle locations (15 - to 31 -cm depth) from each reach (six per reach). These samples were collected after post- (Las Conchas) fire flooding events moved sediment and ash through the two study areas—the downstream reach, however, was affected by higher flows and greater number of flooding events than those affecting the upstream reach. Each kick net sample consisted of ten 1 -m (kick) samples. The 10 subsamples were composited and organisms were picked from randomly selected cells in a sorting pan until 500 organisms had been identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. Both reaches in 2011 were dominated by the collector-gathering mayfly, Baetis tricaudatus. A bioassessment of the downstream reach compared with the upstream (reference) reach was conducted by scoring 10 metrics related to the structure and function of the benthic macroinvertebrate community. While 2009 ranked {{at the highest level}} (nonimpaired), 2011 ranked a level lower (slightly impaired). The slightly lower bioassessment score of the downstream reach in 2011 may be a result of flooding impacts following the Las Conchas fire rather than of LANL operations. Overall, based on the similarity of benthic macroinvertebrate metrics between reaches and the composition of benthic macroinvertebrates favoring pollution intolerant taxa, LANL influences, if any, via the LAC system to the Rio Grande are not significantly impacting water quality of the Rio Grande...|$|R
