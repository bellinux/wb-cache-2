50|$|One of the {{earliest}} was the One stage Orbital Space Truck (OOST) designed by Philip Bono, an engineer for Douglas Aircraft Company, which was a concept for an expendable booster stage which could deliver a payload to orbit in one stage. A reusable version named ROOST was also proposed. Another early SSTO design was a reusable launch vehicle named NEXUS which was designed by Krafft Arnold Ehricke in the early 1960s. It {{was one of the}} largest space craft ever conceptualized with a diameter of over fifty metres and the capability to lift up to two thousand short tons into Earth orbit, intended for missions to further out locations in the solar system such as Mars. The North American Air Augmented VTOVL from 1963 was a similarly large craft which would have used <b>external</b> <b>burning</b> ramjets to decrease the liftoff mass of the vehicle by removing the need for large amounts of liquid oxygen while travelling through the atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|Mercury was {{sacred to}} the Raseśvaras, {{so much so}} that they {{considered}} disparaging mercury blasphemy. Rasahṛidaya mentions mercury to be a creation by Shiva and Gauri whereas, Rasārṇava holds the worship of mercury to be more beatific than the worship of all symbols of supreme lord Shiva. Raseśvaras described eighteen methods of treating mercury — sweating, rubbing, swooning, fixing, dropping, coercion, restraining, kindling, going, falling into globules, pulverising, covering, internal flux, <b>external</b> flux, <b>burning,</b> colouring, pouring, and eating it by parting and piercing it.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} the successful application of CFD to modeling an <b>external</b> <b>burning</b> flowfield. The study used the 2 D, 3 D, and PNS {{versions of the}} SPARK code. Various grids, boundary conditions, and ignition methodologies have been employed. Flameholding was achieved {{through the use of}} a subsonic outflow condition and a hot block located behind the step to ignite the fuel. Since the resulting burning produces a large subsonic region downstream of the cowl, this entire surface can be pressurized to the level of the back pressure. An evaluation of interactions between the ramjet exhaust and the <b>external</b> <b>burning</b> products demonstrate the complexity of this design issue.

5000|$|During transition, {{fuel to the}} gas {{generator}} was not reduced, as in the Griffon 02 when the <b>external</b> flow was <b>burning,</b> but thrust available from the {{gas generator}} automatically decreased {{as a consequence of}} operating at a fixed turbine temperature limit and with increasing compressor inlet temperature. The gas generator RPM was kept at 100% to maintain maximum thrust. The transition to partial ramjet operation may be viewed as complete when, at cruise, the exhaust gas from the gas generator had no residual energy left for thrust production and all the engine thrust came from the afterburner. The afterburner may be viewed as a ramjet combustor with energy transfer from the turbine exhaust gas. In this characterization as a partial-ramjet the ram air burned in the combustor was about 8% of the turbine exhaust that was reheated (most of the 20% ram air was used for cooling [...] ). The airflow through the intake was being induced, or pumped, by the gas generator and heated with maximum afterburner, which gave a thrust distribution, at Mach 3+, of 54% inlet, 17.6% engine, 28.4% propelling nozzle.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The current {{management}} of vulvar cancer {{depends on the}} extension of disease, and includes primary tumor resection with safety margin as well as inguinofemoral lymph node staging. We report {{the case of the}} first leg videoendoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy performed in a woman with a squamous cell vulvar carcinoma. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 74 years old female referred to our institution complaining of vulvar mass associated with bleeding and swelling from <b>external</b> genitals, vaginal <b>burning</b> sensation and dysuria for 5 months. A vulvar-vaginal examination under narcosis reported a right major labium lesion of 5 cm with an irregular and ulcerated surface, easily bleeding on palpation, involving anteriorly the clitoral region and with a histological finding of a poorly differentiated squamous cell invasive carcinoma of the vulva ulcerating the surface epithelium. We performed, after adequate informed consent, a radical vulvectomy with a standard right inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy and a contralateral simultaneous video endoscopic inguinal lymphadenectomy-Leg procedure. DISCUSSION: Our minimally invasive VEIL-Leg approach, performed {{for the first time in}} literature in a woman with vulvar cancer, could reduce the presence of high risk factors represented by surgical incision and by procedure-related complications, including wound infection and breakdown, hematoma, cellulitis and hernia formation. CONCLUSION: A multicenter prospective randomized study will be helpful to clarify how this procedure could replace the standard laparotomic approach to inguinal lymphadenectomy in the vulvar cancer treatment and stagin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNowadays, the {{development}} of new power plants capable of effectively using non-conventional energy sources is strongly desirable in order to obtain a significant reduction in costs of energy. In this regard, this paper proposes a new small scale (about 100 kW) combined cycle plant which can be ﬁred externally by any kind of biomass. Particularly, the research activity presented here is concerned with the preliminary design of this innovative plant, which will be built, by means of a project funded by “Apulia Region”, at the LabZero Research Centre of Polytechnic University of Bari in the south of Italy. The goal of the paper is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the plant in terms of energy efficiency and availability and reliability of its components. The plant is mainly composed of a centrifugal compressor and a centripetal turbine of an automotive turbocharger, with the working fluid (clean air) being heated in a high temperature heat exchanger (HTHE) by using hot flue gases produced in an <b>external</b> combustion chamber <b>burning</b> biomass. The clean hot air expands in the turbine and then feeds the combustion chamber, where biomass is burned. In order to increase the efﬁciency, the flue gases exiting the HTHE are delivered into a heat recovery steam generator to generate water steam which can finally expand through a rotary actuator. Two configurations, employing an open Rankine cycle and a close one respectively, are analysed, and the use of biomass is compared with methane...|$|R

40|$|A {{computational}} {{investigation of}} the effects of <b>external</b> <b>burning</b> on the performance of single expansion ramp nozzles (SERN) operating at transonic speeds is presented. The study focuses on the effects of external heat addition and introduces a simplified injection and mixing model based on a control volume analysis. This simplified model permits parametric and scaling studies that would have been impossible to conduct with a detailed CFD analysis. The CFD model is validated by comparing the computed pressure distribution and thrust forces, for several nozzle configurations, with experimental data. Specific impulse calculations are also presented which indicate that <b>external</b> <b>burning</b> performance can be superior to other methods of thrust augmentation at transonic speeds. The effects of injection fuel pressure and nozzle pressure ratio on the performance of SERN nozzles with <b>external</b> <b>burning</b> are described. The results show trends similar to those reported in the experimental study, and provide additional information that complements the experimental data, improving our understanding of <b>external</b> <b>burning</b> flowfields.

40|$|The {{external}} combustion {{of hydrogen}} to reduce transonic drag was investigated. A control volume analysis is developed and {{indicates that the}} specific impulse performance of <b>external</b> <b>burning</b> is competitive with other forms of airbreathing propulsion and depends on the fuel-air ratio, freestream Mach number, and {{the severity of the}} base drag. A method is presented for sizing fuel injectors for a desired fuel-air ratio in the unconfined stream. A two-dimensional Euler analysis is also presented which indicates that the total axial force generated by <b>external</b> <b>burning</b> depends on the total amount of energy input and is independent of the transverse and streamwise distribution of heat addition. Good agreement between the Euler and control volume analysis is demonstrated. Features of the inviscid <b>external</b> <b>burning</b> flowfield are discussed. Most notably, a strong compression forms at the sonic line within the burning stream which may induce separation of the plume and prevent realization of the full performance potential. An experimental program was conducted in a Mach 1. 26 free-jet to demonstrate drag reduction on a simple expansion ramp geometry, and verify hydrogen-air stability limits at <b>external</b> <b>burning</b> conditions. Stable combustion appears feasible to Mach number of between 1. 4 and 2 depending on the vehicle flight trajectory. Drag reduction is demonstrated on the expansion ramp at Mach 1. 26; however, force levels showed little dependence on fuel pressure or altitude in contrast to control volume analysis predictions. Various facility interference mechanisms and scaling issues were studied and are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Main species {{yields of}} {{compartment}} fires can {{be correlated with}} the ventilation conditions of the compartment, a well known approach referred to as global equivalence ratio concept (GER-concept). From data of experiments in hoods and in a prototype compartment, Gottuk and Lattimer (SFPE 2002) have presented their idealised correlations of CO yields with the GER. The comparison of re-examined and amended data of ISO 9705 compartments shows reasonable agreement with these correlations; also the described temperature effect can be seen. An important extension of the GER-concept concerns upper layer (wood) pyrolysis as it provides an additional CO source also for well-ventilated conditions. A further extension of the GER-concept is made by the reduction of CO yields by external combustion either by flame extensions or by <b>external</b> <b>burning</b> from under-ventilated conditions. The occurrence of flame extensions can be assessed by CFD fire models; for <b>external</b> <b>burning</b> from under-ventilated conditions Beyler’s ignition index is examined. His simple correlation of a GER to allow for external combustion with the upper layer temperature is extended by the combustion efficiency inside the primary compartment and the overall combustion efficiency including external combustion. The results for the ignition criterion fit much better to given experimental data. The efficiency of external combustion to reduce CO yields depends {{on the amount of}} entrained oxygen and thus {{is a function of the}} exhaust vent configuration and the gas mixture in front of the vent...|$|E

40|$|The {{external}} combustion {{of hydrogen}} {{to reduce the}} transonic drag of aerospace vehicles is currently being investigated.

30|$|The fire is {{generally}} regarded as well-ventilated when values of ϕ[*]<[*] 0.3 [*]−[*] 0.5. The combustion within this compartment is of a high efficiency and the yields of soot and carbon monoxide (CO) are low (Pitts 1994). The fire {{is considered to be}} under-ventilated at higher values of ϕ[*]>[*] 1.0. Typically, flashover occurs at a ϕ[*]=[*] 1.0 (Wieczorek et al. 2004). Gottuk (1992) reports sustained <b>external</b> <b>burning</b> occurring at ϕ values around 1.4 +/− 0.4, but other research has reported extension of flames outside the compartment starting at ϕ values of 0.7 (Wieczorek et al. 2004). Gottuk’s (1992) results were gases from the layer burning and escaping, while Wieczorek et al. (2004) had flames resulting from a lack of mixing within the compartment, which has also been identified in compartments with combustible linings (Drysdale 2011). As the combustion zone is not attached to a fuel item or fuel package any longer, it becomes more difficult for the fire investigator to evaluate whether the damage was caused by a flame plume burning attached to a fuel item or if it is the UHCs burning detached from a fuel item due to ventilation-controlled conditions. Therefore, determining if and when the fire transitions from a fuel-controlled to a ventilation-controlled condition is an important distinction.|$|E
40|$|This work is an {{experimental}} and theoretical analysis of factors and conditions affecting smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) production in corridor-like enclosure fires. Thirty eight experiments were {{performed in a}} three metre long corridor-like enclosure having a cross section 0. 5 m x 0. 5 m, door-like openings in the front panel and a propane gas burner located near the closed end. Measurements of smoke and carbon monoxide concentrations were performed at locations inside the enclosure {{and also in the}} exhaust duct of a hood collecting the combustion products. The main conclusion of this work is that smoke production depends not only on the fuel and Global Equivalence Ratio (GER) - as is reported in the literature - but also on the temperatures and residence time inside the enclosure, at least for the experimental conditions examined in this study. Additionaly, it was found that smoke concentration inside the enclosure was increasing during the ventilation controlled regime even after <b>external</b> <b>burning</b> started. Such increase was verified by temperature, smoke and velocity measurements inside the enclosure. The increase was due to reverse flow behind the flames travelling along the corridor. Namely, the gases reversed direction behind the flames with hot gases travelling in the upper layer backwards towards the closed end of the corridor in contrast to hot gas movements towards the opening in front of the flames. This recirculation was confirmed by velocity and oxygen concentration measurements in the upper and lower layers inside the enclosure. In addition, the present results show that the relationship reported in the literature between smoke and carbon monoxide production during overventilated conditions Yco/Ys = constant, is no longer valid during an underventilated enclosure fire. The ratio Yco/Ys increases for the Global Equivalence Ratios of the enclosure greater than one. The obtained results are useful for CFD validation and specifically applicable for assessing smoke hazards in corridor fires in buildings where smoke concentrations can be much larger than anticipated owing to leakage to adjacent rooms behind travelling flames.

40|$|High density fluid {{within the}} {{combustion}} chamber {{of a traditional}} scramjet generates substantial viscous drag, arguably posing {{one of the greatest}} impediments to the attainment of sustained hypersonic flight. This crippling effect could be allayed, therefore, by reducing the quantity of the combustion surfaces, such that burning is allowed to occur without any physical containment. Although unconfined burning has been successfully applied in transonic and supersonic flows to reduce drag and enhance lift, its application to hypersonic flight has been largely unexplored. The potential of implementing <b>external</b> <b>burning</b> for propulsion is herein investigated experimentally. This process contrasts to that used in ducted scramjets because fuel is intentionally burnt on the compressive forebody. The experimental results conclude that thrust production using unconfined supersonic combustion differs fundamentally from the confined burning achieved routinely in ducted scramjet engines. It is found that the unducted scramjet generates thrust primarily via a reduction in Mach number due to burning on the forebody, prior to expanding the flow onto a thrust surface. Any pressure increase produced on the forebody due to unconfined burning is a second order effect. In contrast, a traditional ducted scramjet generates thrust primarily by increasing the pressure in the combustion chamber prior to expanding the higher pressure flow onto a thrust surface; the decrease in Mach number within the combustion chamber due to the burning process is generally a second order effect. A simple double-wedge configuration, comprised of a forebody surface and a thrust surface, was used to demonstrate the principles of thrust production via external combustion. In practice, a more isentropic compression would be used, albeit with a total deflection angle approximating the single wedge angle used here. The wedge compression angle is necessary to achieve the flow temperatures required for auto-ignition. The experiments were conducted in a shock tunnel using hydrogen fuel and a Mach 7. 6 freestream. Pressure and heat flux signals were recorded along the compression and expansion surfaces and were combined with holographic interferometry to investigate the mode, extent and efficacy of the unconfined burning. A thrust surface pressure three times higher with heat addition than without was consistently generated across the test matrix. Modes of heat release on the forebody, other than constant pressure, were also observed. These included both the extremes of delayed, gradual combustion and sudden, rapid heat release. The experimental results are compared with quasi one-dimensional, analytical predictions. The results indicate that external combustion on a forebody, or other compression surface, could be applied to hypersonic flows to generate thrust, lift or a change in pitching moment...|$|E
