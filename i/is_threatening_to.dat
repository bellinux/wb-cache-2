5|$|After {{consulting}} with Deep Throat, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) travels to Townsend and takes {{photos of the}} crash site, only to be captured. After being interrogated by Henderson, Mulder is detained alongside an eccentric NICAP member named Max Fenig (Scott Bellis), who was also captured in the woods. The next morning, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrives to retrieve Mulder, telling him that FBI Section Chief Joseph McGrath <b>is</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> shut down the X-Files because of his behavior. She also claims that the wreckage {{has been identified as}} a downed Libyan fighter jet; Mulder dismisses this explanation. Meanwhile, the invisible occupant of the UFO passes through an electronic fence set up around the crash site, escaping into the outside world.|$|E
5|$|The final level {{takes place}} in Washington, D.C. again, where the two antagonists attempt to flee after {{escaping}} from prison. The player must destroy both Kilbaba and Ortega and stop four trucks carrying nuclear bombs from blowing up the White House. The PC version also extends the storyline with an extra level set in Alaska, in which the player must wipe out the remainder of Ortega's forces {{under the command of}} a Russian defector named Ptofski, who has taken control of oil tankers and <b>is</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> destroy the ecosystem with crude oil if his demands are not met. Once all levels are complete, the ending sequence begins and depicts the protagonist and his co-pilot in an open-topped car in front of cheering crowds.|$|E
5|$|As the {{expansion}} of the Schwarzwelt <b>is</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> destroy Earth, the United Nations send in multiple teams, led by Gore, to investigate and eradicate the phenomenon. During their attempt to enter the Schwarzwelt, all ships but the Red Sprite are destroyed. During their missions, the crew is helped by Arthur, who gradually accumulates knowledge of the Schwarzwelt and develops a personality. During an early mission within the Schwarzwelt, Gore is killed. As the protagonist and members of the Red Sprite's crew explore the regions of the Schwarzwelt, they slowly uncover the truth behind its existence. In ancient times, humans were controlled by the forces of God. His rule over them was broken when the Mother Goddess Mem Aleph destroyed him, breaking his hold on Earth. Residing within the Schwarzwelt, Mem Aleph saw humans abusing Earth's environment and consequently corrupting her dimension. Determined to remove those humans responsible for the corruption and return the world to its ancient state, Mem Aleph unleashed the Schwarzwelt. The remaining forces of God, mainly represented by Mastema, intend to use the Schwarzwelt to spread their influence across the world, removing free will to create a united utopia. Key items are the Cosmic Eggs, objects created by Mem Aleph that can reshape the world when combined by the core of the Schwarzwelt.|$|E

25|$|The {{case has}} even {{involved}} both Manohara biological father and stepfather when Daisy informed Indonesian media that Pinot is in Jakarta to {{lend support to}} Manohara over recent reports that Manz had sided with Tengku Temenggong Muhammad Fakhry, 32, who is Manohara's husband. Pinot also planned to take Manohara to Europe to further her education in arts and economics. Manohara's biological father George Manz believed {{that it is a}} bad idea as Pinot is convicted for sexual haressment and <b>is</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> get the US State Department involved because 17-year-old Manohara is a US citizen.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} diagram below, it is White's turn. White must prevent Black from {{connecting}} the marked stones {{to the others}} by playing at a. The second diagram shows White's move. White <b>is</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> kill the marked black stones by playing at b. In the third diagram, Black plays at b to prevent this, capturing White 1. However, by playing at a again, White can capture Black 2's group. This is not barred by the ko rule because the resulting position, shown in the fourth diagram, differs from the one after White 1 {{by the absence of}} the marked black stones. This kind of capture is called a snapback.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, all {{regional}} branches of DVG were dissolved, {{and for a}} while it appeared the association itself would disappear, but partially due to the rise of Islam, especially after the September 11 attacks, there was once again a need for a firmly atheistic stance in society. DVG joined the Humanistische Alliantie ("Humanist Alliance"), a national umbrella for humanist organisations founded in 2001, but because they found this coalition much too postmodernist and moderate, the freethinkers were hardly involved in its activities. Under chairship of Anton van Hooff, who opined that the 'combativeness against religion and other unscientific quackery' <b>is</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> disappear with the 'softened' humanist groups, they left the Alliantie in 2014, and instead sought to work with amongst others Stichting Skepsis and the Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij.|$|E

25|$|Ipomadon {{travels the}} world, {{fighting}} in tournaments, becomes King of Apulia following his father's death, and hears {{one day that}} the Proud is being besieged in her city by a knight called Lyoline. This ugly knight <b>is</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> take her away with him to India. Ipomadon {{makes his way to}} King Maleager's court once again, just in time to witness the arrival of the Proud's messenger, begging for some assistance for her lady. But curiously, Ipomadon has chosen to arrive at King Maleager's court {{in such a way that}} he is not recognised, not even by the queen. He pretends to be a fool, and the reader (or listener) is treated to a comic scene in which the fool Ipomadon is first ridiculed and then accepted by the knights and noblemen, little knowing who he really is. Cabanus is conveniently absent from court on this occasion. The maiden who has been sent as a messenger by the Proud is mightily unimpressed that a fool should wish to take on the challenge, but since nobody else in the court seems at all inclined to offer their services, the king allows Ipomadon the fool to take it up.|$|E

[...] Prior to the 2005 general election, Gallagher stated that he was still supporting the Labour government partly because of his concern that [...] "Phil Collins <b>is</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> come back and live here.

500|$|The Enterprise is soon {{met by a}} Klingon battlecruiser, captained by Commander K'Nera (David Froman), who {{demands the}} return of the {{fugitive}} Klingons. Knowing that Korris and Konmel will be tried and executed if they are returned, Worf argues instead for their exile to a hostile planet, but K'Nera refuses. Korris and Konmel use parts secreted on their uniforms to assemble a disruptor pistol and escape from the brig; Konmel is killed as Korris takes over the Engineering deck. Picard and Worf race to Engineering, and Worf tries to reason with Korris who <b>is</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> destroy the warp core and take the Enterprise with him. Korris attempts to persuade Worf to come with him and conquer the galaxy as a true Klingon and then accuses Worf of being weak when he refuses. Worf fires on Korris, killing him. K'Nera is told of the deaths of the fugitives, and Worf declares that they [...] "died well" [...] when asked of their manner of death. Worf agrees to consider an offer to serve aboard the Klingon battlecruiser after his service aboard the Enterprise is complete, but when communications with K'Nera are broken off, assures the bridge crew he was just being polite.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{starts with}} Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) announcing to her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), {{that she needs}} to go to Chicago for jury duty because she is still {{registered}} to vote there. Jack gives Liz a powerful sedative for the trip. Later, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) walks in on a meeting between Jack and the American silver medalist in tetherball, Tyler Brody (Remy Auberjonois). Tyler is angry at Jack for not selecting him as the gold medalist, and <b>is</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> go public with the revelation that there was no Olympic tetherball competition during the 2008 Summer Olympics, as it was staged to boost NBC's ratings. To keep him quiet, Jack tells him that he can [...] "be the voice of Knight Rider" [...] in a film adaptation, which Tyler considers. Afterwards, Kenneth tells Jack that he [...] "lost two heroes today", as he looked up to both Jack and Tyler. As a result, Jack wants to be in Kenneth's good side, but wants to break his moral absolutism, after Kenneth did not hesitate to attempt to kill himself when he believed the air in a stalled elevator was about to run out. Jack finally succeeds when he supplies Kenneth with a big screen television, but no cable hookup. Kenneth steals cable and later confesses to Jack, asking if SpongeBob SquarePants [...] "is supposed to be terrifying".|$|E
