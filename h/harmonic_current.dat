When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E

Therefore, the only product terms that have a nonzero average are those where the frequency of voltage and current match.

Furthermore, if we assume the voltage of the mains supply is a single frequency (which it usually is), this shows that <b>harmonic</b> <b>currents</b> are a bad thing. They will increase the rms current (since there will be non-zero terms added) and therefore apparent power, but they will have no effect on the active power transferred. Hence, <b>harmonic</b> <b>currents</b> will reduce the power factor. <b>Harmonic</b> <b>currents</b> can be reduced by a filter placed at the input of the device.

The ARMA-based predictor obtains poor performance on some harmonic orders due to the stochastic characteristics of <b>harmonic</b> <b>current</b> caused by the variations of wind speed.
