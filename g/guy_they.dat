In a bonus mission at Fogwell's Gym, Wolverine and Jean Grey {{are looking for}} new {{recruits}} to help the X-Men battle Magneto and his Brotherhood to get back the Tessaract they stole from X-Mansion. Blob is the only available <b>guy</b> <b>they</b> could find, but he has his objections to it. Wolverine and Jean Grey forge different foods from Lego pieces which tire out Blob, which forces him to surrender and accept their proposal.|$|E

Regarding his preparation for the role, Sarsgaard stated, [...] "I actually did hang with this biologist from Tulane that was I think just the most eccentric <b>guy</b> <b>they</b> could find. He was entertaining, and he and I actually worked on my lecture that I give in [...]" [...] About his character Sarsgaard remarked, [...] "He's got shades of gray. It's eccentricity on top of eccentricity".|$|E

The new team head {{to the top of}} Booster Tower where they evade Booster, but he manages to escape with Toadstool. After {{defeating}} his henchmen, Knife Guy and Grate <b>Guy,</b> <b>they</b> follow Booster to Marymore. They enter the church and intercept the princess, just before she is forcibly married to Booster, but Chef Torte and his apprentice attempt to prevent their escape. While fighting them, the wedding cake that they made comes to life, forcing the chefs to flee, leaving Mario and friends to deal with the living cake (who name is Bundt). Booster helps defeat Bundt by swallowing it whole and now satisfied and no longer needing Toadstool, he returns to his tower in hopes a new wife will come to him overtime.|$|E

500|$|The {{cultural}} references {{featured in}} the episode have attracted both criticism and praise. The parody of Next Media Animation has been commended by several reviewers. [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club commented that the episode [...] "features a couple of quite funny sight gags, like the fresco on Moe's ceiling and the delightful Taiwanese dramatization of certain events", but further wrote that the [...] "rest of the jokes and references clang away without being too funny or too insulting, and that {{is probably the best}} that any viewers can ask of The Simpsons in its advanced age." [...] Television Blend's Steve West commented that the episode was the worst of the Animation Domination lineup that week and further elaborated that the cultural references [...] "are always a year behind, and the smart writers who used classic American culture to bring wit to the series have been replaced by those who want to mimic South Park and Family <b>Guy.</b> <b>They</b> fail miserably, and it's gotten so bad that I now no longer care about the relationship between Marge and Homer." ...|$|E
500|$|Langford {{later said}} that Neighbours {{is doing a}} [...] "fairly decent job" [...] with Chris's coming out story. He wished that viewers got {{to see more of}} Chris's {{thoughts}} and feelings and less of how his situation affected the people around him. Langford added [...] "I do like that Chris isn't a perfect kid. Many shows tend to make gay teens near saints. Instead, he's a fairly average kid who makes mistakes and messes up, like starting a fight at a basketball game. In July 2011, Langford revealed that he had seen some comments from people thinking that Lucas and Chris should be paired up. He opined {{that there is not a}} hint of romance between the two and wondered why people assumed that if a gay character shares a scene with another <b>guy,</b> <b>they</b> must get together. Langford revealed that he liked Chris and Lucas's mentor and mentee relationship as it is. The writer also commented on the introduction of Chris's father and said that he was [...] "delighted" [...] that Chris was finally getting his own drama, that was [...] "pretty realistic." [...] He added [...] "It's nice to see the father/son dynamic play out. I have the feeling that a lot of Chris's dad's issues stem from the fact that his son is gay and I hope the show will delve into those unresoved issues." ...|$|E

Garrett further revealed about his collaboration with the group, [...] "I loved how Destiny's Child evolved and became this really incredible pop group but I wanted to introduce them to the hood {{from the perspective of}} having the world look at them in a different way... What was great about that was they all liked guys from the streets. Each verse was a representation of the <b>guy</b> <b>they</b> were actually into." [...] During an interview with MTV News, Rowland said that with [...] "Soldier" [...] each member wanted to talk about their preference for a man during their solo verses, the place where he lives and his physical appearance. Beyoncé stated that as the song had a [...] "Southern feel" [...] and beat, they wanted to collaborate with Lil Wayne and T.I. who according to her added [...] "rawness, realness and edge to the song". During an interview in 2014, Lil Wayne discussed his contribution in the song, [...] "That set me off. Them little eight bars right there, that got me there boy. If you ask me why, it was Beyoncé. That shit was big." [...] "Soldier" [...] was included on the group's compilation albums #1's (2005) and [...] (2012).|$|E

2500|$|Nimoy {{spoke about}} their mutual rivalry during the Star Trek years: [...] "Very competitive, sibling rivalry up to here. After the show {{had been on}} the air a few weeks and they started getting so much mail for Spock, then the dictum came down from NBC: 'Give us more of that <b>guy,</b> <b>they</b> love that guy, you know?' Well, that can be ... that can be a problem for the leading man who was hired as the star of the show; and suddenly, here's this guy with ears – 'What's this, you know?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Her next {{appearance}} was arguably more significant. Mickey's Follies (June 26, 1929), featured the first {{performance of the}} song [...] "Minnie's Yoo-Hoo".

Mickey then proceeds in explaining his reaction to Minnie's call. The song firmly establishes Mickey and Minnie as a couple and expresses the importance Minnie holds for her male partner.|$|E
2500|$|Vanity Fair {{magazine}} {{revealed that}} Felt was Deep Throat on May 31, 2005, when it {{published an article}} (eventually appearing in the July issue of the magazine) on its website by John D. O'Connor, an attorney acting on Felt's behalf, in which Felt said, [...] "I'm the <b>guy</b> <b>they</b> used to call Deep Throat." [...] After the Vanity Fair story broke, Benjamin C. Bradlee, the Editor of the Washington Post during Watergate, confirmed that Felt was Deep Throat. According to the Vanity Fair article, Felt was persuaded to come out by his family, who wanted {{to capitalize on the}} book deals and other lucrative opportunities that Felt would inevitably be offered in order, at least in part, to pay off his grandchildren's education. His family was unaware that he was Deep Throat for many years, and only realized the truth after his retirement, when they became aware of his close friendship with Bob Woodward.|$|E

Concurrently, Sportsnet announced that Tim & Sid would be re-launched as a television program, premiering on July 1, 2015. Scott Moore, president of Sportsnet and NHL properties at Rogers, likened Tim & Sid to being a [...] "sports content factory" [...] operating across multiple platforms (including television and social media), and explained that Micallef and Seixeiro [...] "are not just highlight <b>guys,</b> <b>they</b> know how to engage on any sports topic and {{the great thing about}} these <b>guys</b> is <b>they</b> can connect with sports fans on any number of levels." ...|$|R
2500|$|Relationship {{between the}} king and Guy became tense during the {{following}} months. Baldwin convoked the barons of the realm to an assembly to discuss {{the future of the}} administration of the kingdom. Raymond, Bohemond, Reginald of Sidon and the Ibelin brothers easily persuaded him to dismiss <b>Guy.</b> <b>They</b> also convinced the king to make Guy's infant stepson, Baldwin of Montferrat, his heir. The child was crowned on 20 November 1183. William of Tyre recorded that it was [...] "the general wish" [...] that the king should also appoint a regent and most barons said that only Raymond [...] "was suited to hold this office". The assembly was soon dissolved, because news about Saladin's sudden attack against Châtillon's Kerak Castle reached Jerusalem. The king mustered an army, but he could not personally participate in the campaign for long, thus he appointed Raymond to command it before the army crossed the Jordan. On learning of the arrival of the relief army, Saladin lifted the siege on 3 or 4 December.|$|E

60|$|Her little {{heart was}} soon open. It {{appeared}} that Felix {{was the last}} who had died, the nearest in age to Marianne, and her favourite playfellow. She told {{of some of their}} sports in their London home, speaking of them with eagerness and fondness that showed what joys they had been, though to <b>Guy</b> <b>they</b> seemed but the very proof of dreariness and dinginess. She talked of walks to school, when Felix would tell what he would do when he was a man, and how he took care of her at the crossings, and how rude boys used to drive them, and how they would look in at the shop windows and settle what they would buy if they were rich. Then she talked of his being ill--ill so very long; how he sat in his little chair, and could not play, and then always lay in bed, and she liked to sit by him, there; but at last he died, and they carried him away in a great black coffin, and he would never come back again. But it was so dull now, {{there was no one to}} play with her.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was after}} the children's dinner, which was also their mother's, but which their aunt mostly {{contrived}} to keep from ever becoming her own luncheon; and the two young women {{were still in the}} presence of the crumpled table-cloth, the dispersed pinafores, the scraped dishes, the lingering odour of boiled food. Kate had asked, with ceremony, if she might put up a window a little, and Mrs. Condrip had replied without it that she might do as she liked. She often received such inquiries as if they reflected in a manner on the pure essence of her little ones. The four had retired, with much movement and noise, under imperfect control of the small Irish governess whom their aunt had hunted out for them and whose brooding resolve not to prolong so uncrowned a martyrdom she already more than suspected. Their mother had become for Kate--who took it just for the effect of being their mother--quite a different thing from the mild Marian of the past: Mr. Condrip's widow expansively obscured that image. She was little more than a ragged relic, a plain, prosaic result of him, as if she had somehow been pulled through him as through an obstinate funnel, only to be left crumpled and useless and with nothing in her but what he accounted for. She had grown red and almost fat, which were not happy signs of mourning; less and less like any Croy, particularly a Croy in trouble, and sensibly like her husband's two unmarried sisters, who came to see her, in Kate's view, much too often and stayed too long, with the consequence of inroads upon the tea and bread-and-butter--matters as to which Kate, not unconcerned with the tradesmen's books, had feelings. About them, moreover, Marian was touchy, and her nearer relative, who observed and weighed things, noted as an oddity that she would have taken any reflection on them as a reflection on herself. If that was what marriage necessarily did to you, Kate Croy would have questioned marriage. It was a grave example, at any rate, of what a man--and such a man!--might make of a woman. She could see how the Condrip pair pressed their brother's widow on the subject of Aunt Maud--who wasn't, after all, their aunt; made her, over their interminable cups, chatter and even swagger about Lancaster Gate, made her more vulgar than it had seemed written that any Croy could possibly become on such a subject. They laid it down, they rubbed it in, that Lancaster Gate was to be kept in sight, and that she, Kate, was to keep it; so that, curiously, or at all events sadly, our young woman was sure of being, in her own person, more permitted to them as an object of comment than they would in turn ever be permitted to herself. The beauty of which, too, was that Marian didn't love them. But they were Condrips--they had grown near the rose; they were almost like Bertie and Maudie, like Kitty and <b>Guy.</b> <b>They</b> talked of the dead to her, which Kate never did; it being a relation in which Kate could but mutely listen. She couldn't indeed too often say to herself that if that was what marriage did to you----! It may easily be guessed, therefore, that the ironic light of such reserves fell straight across the field of Marian's warning. [...] "I don't quite see," [...] she answered, [...] "where, in particular, it strikes you that my danger lies. I'm not conscious, I assure you, of the least 'disposition' to throw myself anywhere. I feel as if, for the present, I have been quite sufficiently thrown." ...|$|E
