A great variety of bit rates are used on the Internet. A bit rate of 128kbit/s {{is commonly used}}, at a compression ratio of 11:1, offering adequate audio quality in a relatively small space.

[...] "We needed somebody who <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> {{of rock and roll}} sensibility in him", Andrew Lloyd Webber explained.

The change in style was largely adopted so they could challenge themselves musically, but not specifically to be heavier: [...] "I don't think we go in wanting to write a heavier record," [...] guitarist Dan Watchorn stated. [...] "I don't think we have a preconceived notion of what we want, the riffs and melodies just kind of come.

500|$|The {{narrative}} of the School Rumble anime is designed to mirror that of the manga, which results in multiple short story segments with no significant connection. Shown {{from the perspective of}} its characters—notably Tenma and Harima as they attempt similar ploys to get their crush to notice their affection—the anime uses absurdist humor which often combines elements of popular culture to explore the love-triangle, with jokes that work on multiple levels. One such example, highlighted by Lisa Marie, reviewer for Anime Today, is the bike chase scene in episode1 of season one. She notes that while anyone can appreciate the chase's inherent humor, those familiar with Initial D will find another level of appreciation that nevertheless does not interfere with viewers who do not catch the deeper reference. Lisa Marie comments [...] "I certainly admit watching an insane bike chase cross paths with Initial Ds famous AE86 <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more [...] when you know why there's a cheesily rendered race car in slow moving Eurobeat." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{seeing the}} {{portrayal}} of Yellowjacket in Ant-Man, the antagonist of the film, McMillian noted, It's hardly a secret that Marvel Studios <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a problem {{when it comes to}} offering up exciting characters for their heroes to fight against ... villains generally fall into one of two camps. There's the Unstoppable Monster ... or there's the Professional White Guy In A Suit With An Ego ... No matter which of the groups the above villains fall into, they share one common purpose: evil. The motivations for evil likely differ—although, invariably, they fall under the umbrella of 'misguided belief in a greater good that doesn't exist'—but that really doesn't matter, because without fail, there will be so little time in the movie to actually properly explore those motivations, meaning that to all intents and purposes, the villain is being evil for reasons of plot necessity and little else ... The strange thing about this is that Marvel's comic books offer a number of wonderful, colorful bad guys who could step outside the above parameters and offer an alternative to the formulaic villains audiences have gotten used to (and arguably bored with) ... In future movies, we can only hope [...] treated {{in such a way that}} their freak flags are allowed to fly free.|$|E

Years later, Jeffrey Henderson, {{who worked on}} the storyboards for the cancelled Spider-Man 4 movie, released information regarding which villains would appear within the movie. One of those included Bruce Campbell's character's progression into Quentin Beck / Mysterio. Ted Raimi, Sam Raimi's actor brother, plays a small role as editor's assistant [...] "Hoffman". Sam Raimi himself appeared off-screen, throwing popcorn at Peter as he enters the arena to wrestle Bonesaw McGraw. Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee also has a cameo, in which he asks Peter, [...] "Hey kid, would you like a pair of these glasses? They're the kind they wore in X-Men." [...] The scene was cut, and Lee only briefly appears in the film to grab a young girl from falling debris during the battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin in Times Square. R/soul singer Macy Gray appears as herself. One of the stunt performers in the film is actor Johnny Tri Nguyen. Robert Kerman, best known for his performances in pornographic and exploitation films, <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> part as a tugboat captain. Lucy Lawless makes a cameo as a punk rock girl. It was also intended for Hugh Jackman to make an appearance in the film as Logan / Wolverine, reprising the role from 2000's X-Men, but a dispute between Sony and 20th Century Fox over the characters' film rights prevented it from happening.

He first played this role in 1901 and {{eventually}} played it thousands of times onstage, often at benefits, and twice on film: the 1913 silent film Scrooge and the 1935 film Scrooge, produced in England. In 1926, Pathé Pictures released the 1913 film in America under the title Old Scrooge. This 1926 print has been released on DVD. [...] The 1935 Scrooge was the first feature-length film {{version of the story}} with sound.

Donald Calthrop portrays Bob Cratchit, and Maurice Evans <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> part as one of Scrooge's debtors. Most prints in circulation are of the abridged, six-reel (hour-long) version. The film was seldom seen due to the popularity of the 1938 and the 1951 film versions of Dickens's novel. Poor-quality prints were shown on television in the 1980s, but in 2002 the film was restored to its original eight-reel length and issued on DVD. In 2007 the hour-long version was issued in a colourised edition.|$|E

Nancy knows Mercedes has set Mitzeee up as she has threatened her on a couple of occasions, even saying [...] "something bad might happen to Nancy's baby if she doesn't get her nose out and that's made Nancy more determined". Fox said that Nancy's attitude towards Mitzeee's situation stems from when Becca was wrongly accused, sent to prison and murdered in jail which makes her [...] "really desperate to get this right for Mitzeee - to get her out and take Mercedes down!" [...] Explaining why Nancy and Mitzeee are such good friends, Fox said: [...] "They're such different people on the surface, but deep down Ann Minniver - Mitzeee's alter ego - is very moral, kind and caring and she's a very clever girl. I think those are all things that Nancy responds to and enjoys. Also, I think Mitzeee just makes Nancy laugh. Mitzeee can be a bit silly sometimes, and that makes Nancy smile". During the storyline, Nancy feuds with Mercedes. Fox said that Nancy <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a [...] "bad girl" [...] in her which she shows during her confrontations with Mercedes, adding that the character has got [...] "more fire in her belly than maybe we'd realised".|$|E

Whereas Slade had been a huge influence on Kiss, the favor was now returned, as Whatever <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of the Hotter Than Hell, early-Kiss sound, which the band has acknowledged. It's still pure Slade, though. The songs and playing here are pretty much out of sight, with monster riffs and a different production style. For the Slade fan, {{this is a great}} record, and one you probably never heard. Rectify that." [...] Joe Geesin of Get Ready to Rock! said of the 2007 Salvo remaster: [...] "legendarily titled after a genuine piece of graffiti, the album is a return to the band's skinhead roots. It was also their first album since leaving Polydor. Some rough Slade style rock'n'roll, but gone was the glam (largely) and the kitsch. Still very much Slade, but if you're only familiar with the early 70s hits this is a very different beast. There's some great rough guitar." [...] In 2010, Classic Rock considered the album [...] "superior: reputation cementing" [...] and wrote: [...] "Viewed with hindsight as the band's 'lost' album, Whatever Happened to Slade was buried by punk, yet praised by many punk musicians. But however marginalised, a world-beating band doesn't become shit overnight, and Whatever Happened to Slade tempers their established qualities with righteous indignation." [...] Colin Harper of Record Collector said: [...] "Returning from their lengthy attempt to crack America, Whatever Happened to Slade showed muscle, but the prime influence was US stadium boogie, paired with Noddy's least charming lyrics." ...|$|E
