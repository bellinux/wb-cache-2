40|$|Abstract. <b>Exploded</b> <b>views</b> {{are often}} used in {{illustration}} to overcome the problem of occlusion when depicting complex structures. In this paper, we propose a volume visualization technique inspired by <b>exploded</b> <b>views</b> that partitions the volume {{into a number of}} parallel slabs and shows them apart from each other. The thickness of slabs is driven by the similarity between partitions. We use an information-theoretic technique for the generation of <b>exploded</b> <b>views.</b> First, the algorithm identifies the viewpoint which gives the most structured view of the data. Then, the partition of the volume into the most informative slabs for exploding is obtained using two complementary similarity-based strategies. The number of slabs and the similarity parameter are freely adjustable by the user. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Exploded</b> <b>views</b> are an {{illustration}} technique where an object is partitioned into several segments. These segments are displaced to reveal otherwise hidden detail. In this paper we apply {{the concept of}} <b>exploded</b> <b>views</b> to volumetric data in order to solve the general problem of occlusion. In many cases an object of interest is occluded by other structures. While transparency or cutaways {{can be used to}} reveal a focus object, these techniques remove parts of the context information. <b>Exploded</b> <b>views,</b> on the other hand, do not suffer from this drawback. Our approach employs a force-based model: the volume is divided into a part configuration controlled by a number of forces and constraints. The focus object exerts an explosion force causing the parts to arrange according to the given constraints. We show that this novel and flexible approach allows {{for a wide variety of}} explosion-based visualizations including view-dependent explosions. Furthermore, we present a high-quality GPU-based volume ray casting algorithm for <b>exploded</b> <b>views</b> which allows rendering and interaction at several frames per second...|$|R

40|$|<b>Exploded</b> <b>views</b> and cutaway views {{have been}} {{demonstrated}} to be powerful visualization techniques to explore the complex internal structures in 3 D volume data. Current approaches for creating them are mainly based on algorithms with very limited user controls. This paper proposes a novel set of whole-hand multitouch gestures for interactive creation and manipulation of these views on 3 D volume data. Moreover, users can also interactively perform bimanual ‘V’-shape cut and volume exploding, remove unwanted volume partitions to effectively create cutaway views, and create threshold-based volume segmentation and <b>exploded</b> <b>views.</b> Our proposed interaction design was also tried out by eight participants in a preliminary pilot study.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} for visualizing complicated mathematical surfaces that {{is inspired by}} hand-designed topological illustrations. Our approach generates <b>exploded</b> <b>views</b> that expose the internal structure of such a surface by partitioning it into parallel slices, which are separated from each other along a single linear explosion axis. Our contributions include a set of simple, prescriptive design rules for choosing an explosion axis and placing cutting planes, as well as automatic algorithms for applying these rules. First we analyze the input shape to select the explosion axis based on the detected rotational and reflective symmetries of the input model. We then partition the shape into slices {{that are designed to}} help viewers better understand how the shape of the surface and its cross-sections vary along the explosion axis. Our algorithms work directly on triangle meshes, and do not depend on any specific parameterization of the surface.
