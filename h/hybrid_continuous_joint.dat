However, this kind of prestress loss is not considered in design and construction processes. This study proves that prestress loss occurs at the <b>continuous</b> <b>joint</b> due to local bending of the tendon which is induced by construction error or the radius of curvature. The result shows that a maximum 3 % of prestress loss occurs at the <b>continuous</b> <b>joint</b> for a single tendon...|$|R

The proposed technique allows intraoral welding of titanium in order to obtain the solidarization of dental implants for improving their primary stability. Commercially pure titanium (c. p.

A metallographic and mechanical evaluation of the joining area was performed by electronic and optical microscopy, as well as by hardness measurements. The welding has been realized in different conditions by a circumferential pulse welding machine, in order to investigate the eventual drawbacks and to optimise the welding procedure. Moreover, the attention was focused on the use of a flux of argon during the procedure, in order to avoid oxidation and to improve the microstructural characteristics of the joint. The characterization of various welded Ti wires led to the individuation of the optimal conditions to obtain a <b>continuous</b> <b>joint</b> without alterations or oxidations.

This modeling approach achieves efficient event-based scheduling by executing only necessary agent interactions.
