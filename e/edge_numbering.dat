ABSTRACT: An edge {{geodetic}} set of a {{connected graph}} G of order p ≥ 2 {{is a set}} [formula] such that every edge of G is contained in a geodesic joining some pair of vertices in S. The <b>edge</b> geodetic <b>number</b> g 1 (G) of G is the minimum cardinality of its edge geodetic sets and any edge geodetic set of cardinality g 1 (G) is a minimum edge geodetic set of G or an edge geodetic basis of G. An edge geodetic set S in a connected graph G is a minimal edge geodetic set if no proper subset of S is an edge geodetic set of G. The upper <b>edge</b> geodetic <b>number</b> g 1 +(G) of G is the maximum cardinality of a minimal edge geodetic set of G. The upper <b>edge</b> geodetic <b>number</b> of certain classes of graphs are determined. It is shown that for every two integers a and b such that 2 ≤ a ≤ b, there exists a connected graph G with g 1 (G) = a and g 1 +(G) = b. For an edge geodetic basis S of G, a subset [formula] is called a forcing subset for S if S is the unique edge geodetic basis containing T. A forcing subset for S of minimum cardinality is a minimum forcing subset of S. The forcing <b>edge</b> geodetic <b>number</b> of S denoted by ƒ 1 (S), is the cardinality of a minimum forcing subset of S. The forcing <b>edge</b> geodetic <b>number</b> of G, denoted by ƒ 1 (G), is ƒ 1 (G) = min{ ƒ 1 (S) }, where the minimum is taken over all edge geodetic bases S in G. Some general properties satisfied by this concept are studied. The forcing <b>edge</b> geodetic <b>number</b> of certain classes of graphs are determined. It is shown that for every pair a, b of integers with 0 ≤ a b and b ≥ 2, there exists a connected graph G such thatƒ 1 (G) = a and g 1 (G) = b.
