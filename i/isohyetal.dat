40|$|Meteorological data play a {{particularly}} {{important role in}} hydrologic research because the climate and weather of an area exert a profound influence on most hydrologic processes. Meanwhile, hydrological data are critical for performing a range of purposes, including water resources assessment, impacts of climate change and flood forecasting and warning. It {{can be said that}} the prevention of disasters caused by floods and droughts would be impossible without rational forecasting technology based on an understanding of the rainfall-runoff phenomenon and statistical analysis of past hydrological data, which cannot be achieved without meteo-hydrological observations. The lack of adequate meteo-hydrological data affects the ability to model, predict and plan for catastrophic events such as floods and droughts which have obvious negative impacts on public health and socio-economic aspects. The accurate estimation of the spatial distribution of meteorological and hydrological parameters requires a dense network of instruments, which entails large installation and operational costs. It is thus necessary to optimize the number and location of meteo-hydrological stations. This paper presents a GIS-based approach to establishing an optimal meteo-hydrological station network on Vu Gia- Thu Bon river basin for developing an up-to-date real time flood warning system. Based on statistical analysis of the annual rainfall total data at 9 existing gauges in the study area from 1980 to 2013, it showed that the error of the existing network was about 7. 47 %. Considering 9 rain gauges as a standard representative of rainfall over the region, if the error decreases from 7. 47 % to 5 %, the number of additional rain gauges should be 20. For adequate and economical network design, these additional rain gauges were spatially distributed between the different <b>isohyetals</b> after considering the relative distances between rain gauges, their accessibility, personnel required for making observations using multi-layers analysis and spatial interpolation. For hydrological stations, based on consideration existing network with the requirements set out by the flood warning system, the number of stations should be five. In terms of spatial distribution, three stations were distributed across two main tributaries of Vu Gia- Thu Bon river basin, behind the dams for water discharge calibration and the others were located on downstream for water stage calibration. The results of the study provided a scientific approach can be applied to optimizing the meteo-hydrological station network over the river basin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: For {{computation}} of weighted rainfall for any catchment area, methods {{being followed}} are Arithmetic mean method, Theissen polygon method and <b>Isohyetal</b> method. The simplest method is Arithmetic mean method {{which gives the}} values {{which may not be}} accurate when compared to Theissen polygon and <b>Isohyetal</b> methods when the rain gauge stations are unevenly distributed and station rain fall values are uneven.

The aim of this work was to choose suitable methods for the calculation of areal rainfall and subsequently to create those methods. Most methods were developed in the GIS program. The next objective was to explore differences in monthly precipitation from hydrological years 2006 and 2007 calculated in the catchment by chosen methods. Chosen methods for the {{calculation of the}} spatial distribution of precipitation in the catchment were: arithmetic mean, Thiessen polygons, <b>isohyetal</b> method and inverse distance weighting method.

During the solution of this thesis the area of interest had to be extended by the area between the used rain gauges which was delimited in the GIS program.

DAD curves exhibit the depth and the area covered by the rainfall with a particular duration. DAD analysis is widely used in characterization of precipitation extremes for specification of so-called design storms. In this study the DAD curves for the Kurdistan province were prepared and investigated. To obtain the rainfall rate for different parts of the region for time durations of 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours, the daily rainfall data from the stations of the Ministry of Energy were studied first and the rainfall data for durations of one to four days were extracted afterward. 19 storms were then selected for the four time durations according to the rule of extensive rainfalls. The rainfall data from the interior meteorology stations and from some of the stations of the neighborhood provinces at the same occurrence time of the last storms were extracted and recorded according to their termination time. In order to determine the average of maximum rainfall depths for different durations for each storm, calculations were performed using <b>isohyetal</b> maps which were prepared by ‘Moving Average ’ method. The initial DAD curves were then prepared using those calculations. Since the maximum rainfall is needed, the initial DAD curves for each duration were combined to obtain a final DAD curve, which is basically the envelope depth-area curve for the corresponding duration. This procedure was performed for all four time durations and ultimately four final DAD curves, one per each time duration, were produced.

It will be help to realize the spatial distribution of soil and water resources and movement of sedimentation for our homeland by studying the spatial variations of typhoon rainfall. Watershed is a unit of topography and an elementary area that applied for the topics of spatial hydrology and sediment movement. This study first used the first law of geography and nonparametric statistics test, and then chose 19 rain gauge stations to analyze the spatial variations of typhoon rainfalls by areal reduction factor curves in the Nam Shih Creek watershed of Northern Taiwan for different durations and return periods. The results of typhoon rainfall spatial distribution from semivariograms analysis of different durations and return periods showed that the range is about 7. 4 km, and the spatial variation increasing by durations and return periods under the range in this site. The semivariogram models built by former analysis used as the input functions for Kriging that making <b>isohyetal</b> maps by integrating GIS. From the <b>isohyetal</b> maps, we can display the spatial distribution of rainfall caused by typhoons in Nan Shih Creek watershed. The spatial distributions of typhoon rainfall lessen gradually from east to west and south to north in this area. Such being the cases, the apparent spatial variations of typhoon rainfall is in the eastern and southern parts of this watershed. For the sake of understanding the relationship between typhoon rainfall degradation and area of distribution, this study applied the <b>isohyetal</b> maps that drawn in the former part to extract areal reduction factors of different durations and return periods, and forming the areal reduction factor curves. As a result of areal reduction factor curves, the areal reduction factors of typhoon rainfalls decayed with accumulative areas of spatial distribution by the power law. The areal reduction factor curves decrease mildly with the rainfall durations on increasing in the fixed return period. In the condition of fixed durations, the areal reduction factor curves also grow less mildly with the return periods extend. In previously description, it shows that the spatial variations of typhoon rainfall trend unvarying in Nan Shih Creek watershed. 颱風為台灣夏秋兩季常見的天氣現象，其所引發之大量降雨除了為台灣地區每年重要之水資源收獲外，亦為擾動該區水土資源空間分布之主因，同時也是此區域大規模土砂災害如山崩、土石流之啟動因子。故探討並瞭解颱風降雨之空間分布的變異性質，對於台灣水土資源之空間分配，以及土砂運動之掌握皆會有所助益。 集水區為地形劃分之單元，常被作為水文、土砂運動分析等研究之單位區域，故本研究亦以集水區為對象，進行颱風降雨空間變異特性之探討。本研究選擇位於台灣北部地區的南勢溪集水區，並依地理學第一定律，挑選鄰接本區之雨量站，以無母數統計進行檢定篩選後，計選取 19 個雨量站，以其所紀錄之歷年 1 小時最大颱風降雨量為基準，推求 2 、 6 、 12 、 18 及 24 小時等不同延時之最大颱風降雨量，再應用甘保氏極端值第一類分布分析重現期距為 5 、 10 、 25 及 50 年等不同頻率年之降雨量，所得結果以地理統計進行分析並建立區域型降雨面積遞減因子曲線，藉以探討集水區颱風降雨量空間分布之變異特性。 由地理統計之半變異函數分析結果顯示，南勢溪集水區颱風降雨空間分布之影響範圍為 7. 4 公里，即各雨量站彼此間的距離如超過此範圍，其雨量資料之空間變異性不隨距離增加而變化；而在影響範圍之內，本區之颱風降雨空間分布會隨降雨延時及重現期距的增加而加大其空間變異程度。 為具體表現本區之颱風降雨空間分布之情形，遂以前項所得之半變異函數作為克利金推估之輸入函數，並應用地理資訊系統建立等雨量線分布圖。由等雨量線圖顯示，南勢溪集水區颱風降雨之分布分別由東向西以及南向北之方向遞減；颱風降雨中心多發生於福山雨量站所在之區域，降雨量則由福山雨量站向東朝下盆雨量站方向遞減；另外，位於本區北端之大桶山雨量所處之區域，則是另一處發生明顯降雨空間變化的地區，故颱風降雨在南勢溪集水區內的分布具有空間變異之特性。 有關颱風降雨量遞減程度如何隨降雨分布面積的改變而變化，遂以所得之等雨量線圖進行不同延時及重現期距之颱風降雨面積遞減因子分析，並建立其隨累積分布面積百分比而變化之降雨面積遞減因子曲線。結果顯示颱風降雨面積遞減因子會隨累積分布面積之增加，依冪定律模式呈現曲線型態之衰減。目次 圖目次	III 表目次	V 摘要	VII 第一章 前言	 1 1. 1 研究緣起	 1 1. 2 研究動機與目的	 3 第二章 文獻回顧	 5 2. 1 空間降雨分析	 5 2. 2 降雨面積遞減因子曲線 	 7 第三章 研究資料與方法 12 3. 1 研究流程	 12 3. 2 南勢溪集水區及其雨量站概況 14 3. 3 無母數統計之檢定	 18 3. 4 水文頻率分析－甘保氏極端值第一類分布	 20 3. 5 地理統計	 22 3. 6 圖層套疊分析	 40 3. 7 降雨面積遞減因子 41 第四章 結果與討論	 43 4. 1 雨量站挑選檢定作業	 43 4. 2 颱風降雨頻率分析	 49 4. 3 半變異函數模式分析與等雨量圖	 52 4. 4 降雨面積遞減因子曲線	 74 第五章 結論與建議	 85 5. 1 結論	 85 5. 2 建議	 87 參考文獻 	 89 附錄	 94 A. 拉格蘭日(LAGRANGIAN) 函數法	 94 B. 共變異數與半變異數之關係	 9...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Shallow, {{translational}} landslides occur naturally and are {{the dominant}} form of erosion in the Pacific Northwest and the Oregon Coast Range. These landslides are triggered during large, infrequent storms. Forest management activities, such as timber harvesting, can exacerbate the occurrence of these landslides. Understanding {{the relationship between the}} occurrence of shallow, translational landslides and the temporal and spatial variability of short duration, high intensity rainfall is an important step to understanding how to manage landslide-prone forested terrain. Rainfall intensity data collected during the last 14 years from a network of 13 tipping bucket rain gauges were analyzed to characterize the rainfall regime of the central Oregon Coast Range. Partial duration analysis was carried out to determine the 2 -, 5 -, 10 -, 25 -, 50 -, and 100 -year return period antecedent precipitation index (API) and rainfall intensities for the 30 -minute, 1 -, 2 -, 6 -, 12 -, and 24 -hour rainfall durations. The Spearman Rank Correlation method was used to determine if patterns existed in the relative rank of rainfall intensities across the study area. <b>Isohyetal</b> maps of rainfall intensity for each unique combination of rainfall duration and return period were also developed. Analysis of the rainfall intensity data showed that rainfall intensity was highly variable across the study area, although the variability across the study area was fairly constant. The coefficient of variation in average rainfall intensity across the study area was approximately 20 percent. The Spearman Rank Correlation method showed that patterns in rainfall occurred across the study area and that these patterns were consistent for all rainfall durations and return periods. In other words, the rain gauge locations that got the most rainfall were the wettest regardless of rainfall duration or return period and {{the same is true for}} the rain gauge locations that received the least amount of rainfall. Examination of the <b>isohyetal</b> maps showed that all of the variability in rainfall intensity occurred within the minimum distances between rain gauge locations, which is 10 to 15 km.

This opinion is also backed by both Lettenmaier (1985) who urged that “regionalisation is the most appropriate method of improving flood quantile estimation,” and Hosking and Wallis (2005) who, after a review of the recent literature, advocated the use of regional frequency analysis {{based on the belief that}} a “well conducted regional frequency analysis will yield quantile estimates accurate enough to be useful in many realistic applications.” Rainfall data of various durations were plotted on the map to study the spatial distribution of the mean annual rainfall values and their ratios to the daily rainfall values. Data of the selected stations were plotted (using Grapher software) to obtain <b>isohyetal</b> maps to find out the similarity of rainfall pattern within the study area.|$|E

The simulation's sensitivity and accuracy were checked against the official <b>isohyetal</b> map of Arizona (Univ. of Arizona, 1965) by changing the density of the interpolation nodes. The simulation was found to be in good agreement with the official map. The average areal-rainfall was calculated by integration. Cumulative rainfall amounts were assumed to be stochastically independent from one season to another. The seasonal precipitations of forty years (1932 - 1972) were subdivided into five groups. to check for binomial distribution. The binomial model fits the historical data adequately. The binomial model for cumulative seasonal areal-precipitation provides one way to compute the return period. This information will be necessary for decision-makers and hydrologists to predict the area's future water balance...|$|E
40|$|Rainfall {{frequency}} analysis and rainfall maps for short storm durations and various return periods pertaining to Central and South Florida {{are used for}} design, regulatory and hydrologic applications. Periodic updating of these analyses and maps is essential when additional data and new technologies become available. The objective {{of this study is}} to update the existing rainfall {{frequency analysis}} by using up-to-date data and detailed analysis, and to prepare maps showing contours of rainfall depths (<b>isohyetal</b> maps) for selected durations and return periods. The South Florida Water Management District collects and archives rainfall data from various rain gages. The daily rainfall data collected between January 1, 1900 to December 31, 1999, a period of 100 years, were used for this study. Three sets of rainfall gage records for one-day, three-day and five-day durations were used in determining the maximum rainfall over their respective period-of-record. The maximum recorded rainfall varied from four to 18 inches for the one-day duration; six to 20 inches for the three-day duration; and eight to 22 inches for the five-day duration. Central and South Florida was affected by 38 hurricanes and 23 tropical storms from 1900 to 1999. Of these 61 rainfal...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the general principles {{of water resources}} management namely assessment, planning, development, allocation, protection, conservation and monitoring; and examines their implementation in the Lake Chilwa catchment area. The water balance equation {{has been used as}} a basis for assessing the availability of water resources in the Basin. Mean values of rainfall, surface runoff and baseflow and evapotranspiration have been computed using the Thiessen and <b>Isohyetal</b> methods, the HYDATA software and CROPWAT package respectively. Results obtained from the evaluation of the water balance equation indicate that evapotranspiration values exceed the amount of annual rainfall, prompting the suggestion that water demand for evapotranspiration processes are met from water in storage. General circulation models suggest that the continued emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere will lead to an increase in temperature by 2. 6 - 4. 7 oC by the year 2075, whereas rainfall will continue to show variability with floods and droughts wrecking havoc in the Basin. For the sustainable management of water resources in the catchment area, the study has recommended the development of a water resources master plan. The responsible water authorit...|$|E
40|$|The hydrologic {{characteristics}} of watersheds in semiarid regions are dependent upon many variable and often interrelated factors. A quantitative {{knowledge of these}} factors and of their relative influence upon {{the system as a}} whole is needed in order to improve the efficiency of watershed management in these areas. In an attempt to develop a comprehensive simulation model of a semiarid watershed, research workers in the Agricultural Research Service considered the electronic quently signed with Utah State University. Analog modeling concepts are based upon the development of basic relationships which describe the various processes which occur within the surface hydrologic system of a semiarid watershed. Once established, the model is applicable to any particular geographic unit by determining the appropriate constants of the hydrologic equations. The analog computer is ideally suited to the many time-dependent differential equations which are encountered in hydrologic systems. To test individual equations and to verify the model, a subbasin of Walnut Gulch watershed in southern Arizona was simulated. In preliminary tests, close agreement was achieved between the observed and computed runoff hydrographs for a single storm. Some progress is also reported in the development of an analog technique to plot <b>isohyetal</b> lines corresponding to selected time intervals {{during the course of a}} storm...|$|E
40|$|A common {{existing}} {{approach to}} modeling rainfall extremes employs a spatial Bayesian hierarchical model, where latent Gaussian processes are specified on distributional parameters {{in order to}} pool spatial information. The data are taken to be conditionally independent given the latent processes, and so spatial dependence arises only through this conditional structure. This methodology can be extended by incorporating an explicit max-stable dependence structure, which therefore produces more realistic spatial surfaces, and removes the assumption of conditional independence. We further extend the max-stable methodology to incorporate the joint modeling of rainfall data at different accumulation durations. We therefore pool information across both space and accumulation duration within a broad framework which includes an explicit specification of spatial dependence. Our model {{can be used to}} derive inferences at ungauged sites, and easily incorporates missing values. Our methodology is applied to a dataset of pluviometer records recorded at 182 meteorological stations located on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia. For each station, rainfall data are accumulated over 16 different durations ranging from 5  min to 7 days. The model is fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, employing auxiliary variables so that exact Bayesian inference can be performed. We present estimated parameters and posterior inferences for <b>isohyetal</b> maps and intensity-duration-frequency curves at selected sites of interest, and compare our inferences with those derived from the standard latent variable model...|$|E
40|$|Average global {{temperatures}} {{are higher than}} they have ever been during the past millennium and the levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere have crossed all previous records. The earth’s climate is most affected by difference in temperatures on land, sea, water and topography. Climate is the average weather conditions with a minimum period of 30 years including temperature, rainfall, and wind. The present study aims to generate the primary data to map the rainfall trends {{and its impact on}} groundwater level fluctuation through geomatics techniques. Efforts have been made to evaluate a total of 40 representative rain gauge station samples and analyzed the seasonal rainfall variation over a period of 32 years (1983 - 2014). 50 representative groundwater well samples are collected to study the season-wise groundwater fluctuation of about 14 years (2001 - 2014). Rain gauge stations are plotted on a base map with their respective amount of rainfall, and then the contours of equal rainfall (isohyetes) are drawn using GIS software. The average rainfall between the successive isohyets taken as the average of two <b>isohyetal</b> values is weighed with the area between the isohyets. Climate change and certain human activities threatened directly the groundwater resources globally. The final results highlight the capability of geomatics technique in analyses of impacts of climate over groundwater level fluctuation in typical Precambrian rocks of Mysuru District, Karnataka, which is a suitable model in similar geological conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} monitored {{network of}} rapid-response Raymond-Wilson rainfall intensity gauges is operating at the Cloud Physics Observatory (CPO), on the windward {{coast of the}} island of Hawaii, recording the passage of both warm and cold cloud rain showers. During a one-year (1 July 1973 to 30 June 1974) monitoring period, 57 rainfall events were recorded with intensities {{greater than or equal}} to 95 mm/hr. Four of these events exhibited rainfall rates greater than 250 mm/hr. Each of these events is analyzed as a case study documenting the network rainfall intensity records, the associated local variations in potential gradient, surface wind velocity and atmospheric pressure, rawinsonde soundings of temperature, dew point and winds, satellite and 250 -mb wind data, and an <b>isohyetal</b> presentation of the accumulated rainfall over the island. Of the four cases studied, three were clearly of cold cloud origin, two being synoptic-scale events associated with low pressure centers west of Hawaii and the third a highly localized thunderstorm related to an upper level trough. The most interesting case was a 268 mm/hr rainfall intensity event almost certainly of warm cloud origin. This case (22 June 1974) may represent a record high rainfall rate from clouds known to lie entirely beneath the freezing level. Finally, a comparison is made of the winds aloft with a calculated disturbance velocity indicating, in most cases, that the surface wind gust occurring just before the onset of rainfall is approximately equal to the wind vector at cloud level. Two anomalous cases are discussed briefly. U. S. Department of the Interior, Water Resources Research Act Grant/Contract No. 14 - 31 - 0001 - 5011 Project No. B- 032 -H...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{describe}} an objective classification scheme for extreme UK daily precipitation {{to be used in}} flood risk analysis applications. We create a simplified representation of the spatial layout of extreme events based on a new digital archive of UK rainfall. This simplification allows a Bayesian clustering algorithm to compress these representations down to eight prototypical patterns of extreme falls. These patterns are then verified against a five-class, manual, subjective typing scheme, produced independently using known meteorological mechanisms, <b>isohyetal</b> maps and additional descriptive text from the archive. Compared against the manual scheme, the new objective scheme can reproduce the known meteorological conditions, both in terms of spatial layout and seasonal timing, and is shown to be of hydrological relevance when matched to several notable flooding events in the past century. Furthermore, it is computationally simple and straightforward to apply in classifying future extreme rainfall events. We discuss the practical use of this new typing scheme in flood simulations and climate change applications. Citation: Little, M. A., Rodda, H. J. E. & McSharry, P. E. (2008).
