50|$|The BMD was {{originally}} dropped under the MKS-350-9 multi-canopy parachute with a <b>descending</b> <b>speed</b> between 15 m/s and 20 m/s. The {{intention was to}} drop the vehicle without the crew. This proved to be very problematic, since the crew frequently landed at a considerable distance from the vehicle and often had trouble finding it. Also, the vehicle itself could easily land in a location from which it couldn't be extracted (either {{because of a lack}} of suitable equipment or because of the location being virtually inaccessible). Several experiments were done in the 1970s in order to find a way to circumvent these limitations, including dropping the BMD with the two key crew members, the driver and gunner, seated inside the vehicle during the descent. The first such test took place in January 1973, and the concept was proved to be valid in a subsequent series of tests.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{stability}} of reservoir landslide would be influenced obviously by {{the fluctuation of}} water level, especially when the water descends, which is different from common landslide. Due to the unsteady seepage of underground water inside slope caused by the change of water level, the stability analysis of reservoir landslide through fluid-solid coupling is very complicated. At present, most people hold the view qualitatively that the less the permeability coefficient is and the faster the water level changes, the more unfavorable {{it is to the}} stability. This view lacks quantitative basis. Based on FEM strength reduction, the paper analyzes the influence of different sets of <b>descending</b> <b>speed</b> and permeability coefficient on the {{stability of}} reservoir landslide through fluid-solid coupling analysis.

Study {{about the}} {{performance}} of the service brakes and the retardation systems of commercial vehicles during the <b>descending</b> <b>speed</b> control on roads with long length steep inclination in Brazil. Mathematical models, based in the equations of the energy balance during the vehicle braking process are used. The thermal performance of the service braking system, of the engine cooling system, and of retarders, are verified for the established maximum safety speeds for a vehicle traveling downhill. The simulations are performed with programs elaborated in the Matlab-Simulink platform and with the vehicles as per the European norm ECE R 13 requirements (test type II A) and the Brazilian norm requirement (NBR 10967) for the downhill functional test (test type III). The obtained results show {{that it is possible to}} have a forecast of the dissipated power in the engine and the retarder, of the capacity of dissipated heat of the radiator, and other parameters to guarantee the effective speed control of the vehicle, as per the requirements of the norms, even before the road test are performed...|$|E
40|$|Coronal rain clumps and {{prominence}} knots are dense condensations with chromospheric {{to transition}} region temperatures that fall {{down in the}} much hotter corona. Their typical speeds {{are in the range}} 30 [...] 150 km s^- 1 and of the order of 10 [...] 30 km s^- 1, respectively, i. e., they are considerably smaller than free fall velocities. These cold blobs contain a mixture of ionized and neutral material that must be dynamically coupled in order to fall together, as observed. We investigate this coupling by means of hydrodynamic simulations in which the coupling arises from the friction between ions and neutrals. The numerical simulations presented here are an extension of those of oliver 2014 to the partially ionized case. We find that, although the relative drift speed between the two species is smaller than 1 m s^- 1 at the blob center, it is sufficient to produce the forces required to strongly couple charged particles and neutrals. The ionization degree has no discernible effect on the main results of our previous work for a fully ionized plasma: the condensation has an initial acceleration phase followed by a period with roughly constant velocity and, in addition, the maximum <b>descending</b> <b>speed</b> is clearly correlated with the ratio of initial blob to environment density...|$|E

In this paper, we analyze the EE of downlink multi-cell massive MIMO systems under spatially correlated channel model, where both transmit and circuit power consumptions, training overhead, channel estimation and pilot contamination (PC) are taken into account. We obtain the maximal EE for the systems with maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) for given number of antennas and users by optimizing the transmit power. The closed-form expressions of approximated optimal transmit power and maximal EE, and their scaling laws with the number of antennas M are derived for the systems with MRT and ZFBF. Our analysis shows that the maximal EE decreases with M for both systems with and without PC, but with different <b>descending</b> <b>speeds.</b> For the system without PC, the optimal transmit power should be configured to increases with M, while for the system with PC, the optimal transmit power should be configured as a constant independent from M.

40|$|The {{finite element}} (FE) {{investigation}} on the {{load carrying capacity}} of corroded RC beam is carried out based on the bond-slip between the steel bars and concrete. In the numerical simulation, several FE models of RC simply supported beam with different corrosion ratios were built using ANSYS. In these FE models, element of Solid 65 was used to simulate concrete, element of Link 8 was used for bars and element of Combin 39 was adopted to simulate the bond and bond-slip between bars and concrete. The effect of corrosion ratio on bonding force between bars and concrete was simulated by adjusting the parameter of Combin 39. Besides, the reduction of bars section area and decrease of bars yielding stress were also considered for calculating the load carrying capacity of corroded RC beam with different corrosion ratios. The results show that as the corrosion ratio increases the stiffness of corroded beam would decrease, slip between bars and concrete would be larger and ductile failure of RC beam would turn to brittle failure. The load carrying capacity of corroded RC beam would obviously deteriorate and <b>descending</b> <b>speed</b> is the fastest when the corrosion rate falls {{in the range of}} 4 %- 7 %...|$|E

The spatio-temporal variation characteristics of annually- and seasonally-averaged PAR spatial data over China in recent 50 years were analyzed with Mann-Kendall trend analysis method and GIS spatial analysis techniques. The results show that: (1) As a whole, the {{spatial distribution of}} PAR is complex and inhomogeneous across China, with lower PAR in the eastern and southern parts of China and higher PAR in the western part. Mean annual PAR over China ranges from 17. 7 mol m(- 2) d(- 1) to 39. 5 mol m(- 2) d(- 1). (2) Annually- and seasonally-averaged PAR of each pixel over China are averaged {{as a whole and}} the mean values decline visibly with fluctuant processes, and the changing rate of annually-averaged PAR is - 0. 138 mol m(- 2) d(- 1) / 10 a.

(3) The analysis by each pixel shows that PAR declines significantly (alpha= 0. 05) in most parts of China. Summer and winter play more important roles in the interannual variability of PAR. North China is always a decreasing zone in four seasons, while the northwest of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau turns to be an increasing zone in four seasons. (4) The spatial distributions of the interannual variability of PAR vary among different periods. The interannual variabilities of PAR in a certain region are different not only among four seasons, but also among different periods...|$|E

40|$|The {{blast furnace}} (BF) that {{converts}} iron ore into molten iron {{is an important}} component in iron-steel making. An improvement of the blast furnace fuel efficiency contributes to the reduction of energy consumption in the steel industry because this process represents about 70 % of the total energy input to this industry. The goal of the research is to improve the competitive edge of steel mills by developing the advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model to optimize the gas and burden distributions inside a blast furnace for achieving the best gas utilization. A state-of-the-art 3 -D CFD model has been developed for simulating the gas distribution inside a blast furnace at given burden conditions, burden distribution and blast parameters. The comprehensive 3 -D CFD model has been validated by plant measurement data from an actual blast furnace. Validations of the sub-models are also achieved. ^ The burden distribution is direct related to efficiency and stable blast furnace operation. In this research, a mathematical model for estimating the burden distribution was developed with the combination of the falling curve sub-model, stock-line profile formation sub-model and burden descending sub-model. In a blast furnace, the burden descending velocity may be non-uniform along the radial direction due to the shaft angle and non-uniform consumption. The modifications on two existing burden descending models, i. e., geometric profile (GP) model and potential flow (PF) model are proposed to consider the non-uniform <b>descending</b> <b>speed.</b> The proposed non-uniform descending models are validated with published scaled blast furnace model results. Comparing to the original uniform descending model, the accuracy increases notably for the modified models with the non-uniform descending velocity. ^ The blast furnace burden consists of alternative layers of iron ore and coke. A novel methodology is proposed to efficiently model the effects of alternative burden layer structure on gas flow, heat transfer, mass transfer and chemical reactions. Different reactions and heat transfer characteristics are applied for difference types of layer. ^ In addition, the layered CFD model accurately predicts the Cohesive Zone (CZ) shape where the melting of solid burden taking place. The shape and location of the CZ are determined by an iterative method based on the ore temperature distribution. A new methodology has been developed to determine the location and shape of the CZ, based on the burden temperature distribution and composition. In addition, an under-relaxation scheme has been developed to obtain layered CZ shape which explicitly considered the layer structure inside the CZ. ^ The user friendly software package named Blast Furnace Shaft Simulator (BFSS) has been developed to simulate the blast furnace shaft process. The BFSS software package has been used for the optimization of burden and gas distributions to maximize gas utilization with proper furnace permeability for given burden materials, productivities, and blast furnaces; and also to optimize the burden and gas distributions for high fuel injection rate and low coke rate. The research has significant benefits to the steel industry with high productivity, low energy consumption, and improved environment. Using the BFSS, it is possible to design, optimize, and trouble shoot the blast furnace operation. ...|$|E
