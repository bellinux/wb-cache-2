40|$|The {{hypothesis}} was tested that ant <b>dispersed</b> plant species are {{adapted to the}} seasonal variation in ant activity, i. e. that ant <b>dispersed</b> plant species produce ripe fruits when the activity of their seed dispersers is especially high. Two testable predictions of this hypothesis exist: 1. Ant <b>dispersed</b> and differently <b>dispersed</b> plant species differ in their seasonal development, i. e. ant <b>dispersed</b> plant species fruit (flower) earlier or {{later in the year}} than other plant species. Floristic investigations yielded ant <b>dispersed</b> plant species to flower and fruit 1. 5 - 2 month earlier than non-ant <b>dispersed</b> plant species. Since other factors such as growth form, seed size or pollination mode may have caused this seasonal difference, multivariate analyses were performed. The results demonstrated that these additional factors had only little influence on the seasonal difference and that the effect was mainly due to the mode of seed dispersal. 2. At times when ant <b>dispersed</b> plant species produce ripe fruits the ant activity must be higher than at times when non-ant <b>dispersed</b> plant species do. Investigations of seasonal frequencies of ant individuals and of seasonal seed removal rates revealed ant activity to be especially high from May to July. Mean fruiting time of ant <b>dispersed</b> plant species was the beginning of July. Mean fruiting time of non-ant <b>dispersed</b> plant species was end of August / beginning of September. Statistical tests revealed that if ant <b>dispersed</b> plants had fruited as late as the other plants, they would have suffered a significant loss in seed removal. These results support the hypothesis drawn up in the beginning. The early fruiting times of ant <b>dispersed</b> plants appear to be an adaptation to the seasonal variation in ant activity...|$|R

In this paper, the {{influences}} of abrasive size, abrasive concentration and admixture way on the abrasive <b>dispersing</b> of the sintered ultra-fine diamond tool were systemically investigated.

The abrasive <b>dispersing</b> was quantitatively evaluated by the statistic laws of grit spacing in a certain area. Experimental results indicated that the <b>dispersing</b> was mainly influenced by the abrasive size. The ultra-fine abrasive tended to agglomerate with the decrease of grit sizes due to the increase of surface energies.

40|$|A Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS) is an imaging {{spectrometer}} which can acquire a hyper-spectral data {{set in a}} single snapshot (one focal plane array integration time) with no moving parts. A specially designed <b>dispersing</b> element, which separates light from the three-dimensional object cube into a grid of two-dimensional prismatic diffraction orders, is the key element in the instrument. The capabilities of the CTIS instrument can be improved by employing a more optimized grating design. There were two main goals to this research: (1) to design a novel CTIS <b>disperser</b> that will improve CTIS capabilities over the previous 5 x 5 <b>disperser</b> and (2) to integrate the new <b>disperser</b> into the CTIS and evaluate its performance compared to the 5 x 5 <b>disperser.</b> Six new <b>disperser</b> ideas were evaluated based on their performance {{in a number of}} computer simulations to determine the most optimal dispersion pattern.
