40|$|Spot welds {{are widely}} used to <b>join</b> <b>plate</b> {{structures}} such as an automotive body and the vibration characteristics of the 	whole structure {{are affected by the}} spot welded joints. For the spot welded structure, the actual spot welding location is 	often misaligned from the design specific location. In this paper, we investigate the effect of welding location variability 	on the vibration characteristics of plate structures based on Fuzzy finite element method (FFEM) with Monte Carlo 	simulation. From the membership functions of the natural frequencies from the FFEM and the histograms of the natural 	frequencies from the interval analysis in the FFEM, we examine the modes that are strongly affected by welding 	location variability and the locations that strongly affect the vibration characteristics. As an example structure, the 	structure consisting of hat section steel plates joined together by 20 spot welds at the flanges is used...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical joints such as bolted {{and spot}} welded joints {{are widely used}} to <b>join</b> <b>plate</b> structures. The {{existence}} of contact 	interface in the joint increases the vibration damping in the structure because the energy dissipation due to friction occurs at 	the interface. In this paper, we propose a procedure for calculating the energy dissipation at the interface using finite element 	analysis to estimate the damping for the fundamental and the higher modes. We use the static contact analysis instead of the 	dynamic contact analysis to reduce computational effort and use the mode shapes of linear FE model of the joined plate 	structure as the forced displacement in the static contact analysis. This enables us to obtain the energy dissipation depending 	on the mode shape for each mode. To improve the calculation accuracy of the energy dissipation, we apply a surface load on 	the overlap (interface) region and find the necessary value of surface load. To validate the proposed procedure, the modal 	damping ratios estimated from the dissipated energy are compared with the measured damping ratios. The results show that 	the proposed procedure enables to accurately estimate the energy dissipation of the joined plate structure. The necessary 	surface load increases with increasing mode number and varies almost proportionally with {{the square of the}} angular 	frequency...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringThis work {{documents}} {{the development of}} a novel finite element. This element introduces parameters that allow more accurate modeling for the specific application of mechanically fastened lap joints. The research here bridges the gap between two traditional methods commonly used in industry today. The novel element is more accurate than the first traditional method, by using a single-beam element to <b>join</b> <b>plate</b> elements with a linear solution. It is also more computationally compact than the second traditional method, which consists of an assembly of solid, three-dimensional elements with a non-linear solution. The case studies used are specifically limited to mechanically fastened lap joints pulled in tension, also referred to as "secondary bending. " The plates joined together with these fasteners are loaded up to a fraction of a yielding load of the plate material in order to maintain linearity. Isotropic materials are used exclusively for both the plates and fasteners. Ultimately, the fastening element created in this study is intended strictly for a linear calculation. The calculation contains a one-dimensional beam element with two nodes that connects two, two-dimensional plate elements together. To match the problem more accurately, this research introduces the principle of finite element Hertzian contact mechanics, which is specifically applied to mechanically fastened lap joints. This addition to the existing beam finite element allows for a more accurate simulation while holding to the simplicity of a linear solution of a single element with two nodes in a plate/beam/plate element modeling scheme. Transverse deflections resulting from the applied loading in this new finite element are first compared to the two baseline finite element models that the new element is intended to bridge. The new model is also compared to the deflections calculated from empirically formulated stiffness values generated for the neutral line model...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Resistance {{spot welding}} (RSW) is vastly used in {{automobile}} industries to cut weight {{and lower the}} cost. It is necessary to improve ultimate strength of spot-welded joints for safety of automotive. The Spot weld joints provide localized connection which leads to high stress concentration in the <b>joined</b> <b>plates.</b> Also due to improper design excessive stresses and premature failure occurs in <b>joined</b> <b>plates.</b> A designer should have concentration {{on the strength of}} component by introducing the changes in its geometry and weld patterns that will reduce the vibration and noise of the structural models. Also increases the strength of the structures. The optimum design of geometry and weld patterns will give optimal performance i. e. good strength to the composed structures. The aim {{of this study is to}} find out the effect of spot weld parameters on the strength of spot weld. The effect factors of multiple spot-welded joints strength are analyzed including spot weld arrangement, distance between two spot welds, spot weld diameter and thickness based on finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental results. The study shows that weld diameter and thickness are primary factors affecting the strength of the joints for a given material. On the basis of effect factor analysis the optimized parameters are also discussed to improve the strength of structure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMagnesium is {{flammable}} {{material and}} to avoid its limitation of fusion welding solid state welding process, called friction stir welding (FSW), is applied for <b>joining</b> two <b>plates</b> together. The friction stir welding uses a non-consumable tool for <b>joining</b> abutting <b>plates</b> of magnesium alloy AZ 91 having 6 mm thickness. FSW process <b>joins</b> the <b>plates</b> with advantages such as low distortion, no shielding gas required, and fine recrystallized microstructure. In Friction stir welding, process parameters such as welding speed, tool rotation speed, tool dimensions and axial force {{play an important role}} during welding. In the present work, the 6 mm thick plates of the said alloy are joined at welding speed of 28 mm/min to 56 mm/min with tool rotation speed ranging from 710 rpm to 1400 rpm. Tensile testing was carried out to know the best parameter from the selected ones. Observations are also made for any defects by using fluorescent penetrant testing and photo micrographs...|$|R
