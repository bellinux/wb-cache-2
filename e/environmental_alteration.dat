5000|$|A {{number of}} criticisms of DIT {{have been put}} forward. From some points of view, {{use of the term}} ‘dual inheritance’ to refer to both what is {{transmitted}} genetically and what is transmitted culturally is technically misleading. Many opponents cite horizontal transmission of ideas to be so [...] "different" [...] from the typical vertical transmission (reproduction) in genetic evolution that it is not evolution. However, 1) even genetic evolution uses non-vertical transmission through the <b>environmental</b> <b>alteration</b> of the genome during life by acquired circumstance: epigenetics, and 2) genetic evolution is also affected by direct horizontal transmission between separate species of plants and strains of bacteria: horizontal gene transfer. Other critics argue {{that there can be no}} [...] "dual" [...] inheritance without cultural inheritance being [...] "sequestered" [...] by the biotic genome. [...] Evidence for this process is scarce and controversial. Why this is a demand of critics, however, can be considered unclear as it refutes none of the central claims laid down by proponents of DIT.|$|E

The study, carried out in 9 months, aimed at establishing a database for statistical analyses to define a novel index of water quality, specifically calibrated for moss bags, and suitable for bio-monitoring purposes where autochthonous bryophytes are not available. The background level was estimated for each element, the ratio between sample and background concentration was adopted as measure of <b>environmental</b> <b>alteration</b> and a five-class interpretation scale was defined. The 73. 8 % of measured concentrations reflected a condition of naturality, 16. 6 % suspect of alteration, 7. 6 % sure alteration, 1. 6 % severe alteration and < 0. 5 % extreme alteration. The condition of global <b>environmental</b> <b>alteration</b> (all contaminants) at each station was also defined. Forty-four stations presented absence or suspect of alteration, 39 sure alteration for one or more elements.

The lichen biodiversity showed a general condition of moderate <b>environmental</b> <b>alteration</b> around the geothermal power plants, contrasting with the low <b>environmental</b> <b>alteration</b> of the remaining sites investigated. According to the accumulated Hg in lichen thalli, {{it was possible to}} estimate mean Hg and H 2 S concentrations in the air, which resulted in very good agreement with values measured instrumentally.

We implemented a before-after, control-impact (BACI) designed experiment in a high-elevation, old-growth spruce {{forest in the}} eastern Tibetan Plateau to understand the response in cover and species richness of the understory plant community and its assemblages, {{as well as the}} driving roles of <b>environmental</b> <b>alteration</b> (e. g., radiation, temperature, humidity, and nutrients), physical disturbance (e. g., direct damage by trampling and tree-felling), and interplay effects (e. g., shading or burial from logging residue) during a 2 -year period. The decrease in cover for the understory vegetation was predominantly due to a decrease in bryophytes; the grass cover, however, increased. While bryophyte species richness decreased, the total number of understory and vascular plants changed minimally. Furthermore, the <b>environmental</b> <b>alteration</b> drove the increase in grass cover, as well as the cover and species richness decline for bryophytes and its two species groups. It was also found that physical disturbances and interplay effects caused the decrease in cover for bryophytes. The total effects influenced the understory community and bryophytes in terms of cover, but not in terms of species richness. We conclude that the short-term responses of understory vegetation to clear-cutting are distinct across different assemblages due to various mechanisms. Bryophytes are more sensitive than vascular plants, and cover percentage responded more swiftly than species richness to clear-cutting...|$|E

40|$|Changes in {{the cell}} growth rate of an in vitro {{cellular}} system in Arabidopsis thaliana induced by short exposure to an altered gravity environment have been estimated by a novel approach. The method consisted of defining three structural nucleolar types which are easy and reliable indicators of the ribosome biogenesis activity and, consequently, of protein biosynthesis, a parameter strictly correlated to cell growth in this cellular system. The relative abundance of each nucleolar type was statistically assessed in different conditions of gravity. Samples exposed to simulated microgravity for 200 min showed {{a significant decrease in}} nucleolar activity compared to 1 g controls, whereas samples exposed to hypergravity (2 g) for the same period showed nucleolar activity slightly increased,. These effects could be considered as an early cellular response to the <b>environmental</b> <b>alteration,</b> given the short duration of the treatment. The functional significance of the structural data was validated by a combination of several different well-known parameters, using microscopical, flow cytometry, qPCR and proteomic approaches, which showed that the decreased cell growth rate was decoupled from an increased cell proliferation rate under simulated microgravity, and the opposite trend was observed under hypergravity. Actually, not all parameters tested showed the same quantitative changes, indicating that the response to the <b>environmental</b> <b>alteration</b> is time-dependent.

Declines in species richness are well documented for many taxonomic groups, but less is known about how and why species composition and beta diversity (β) change in response to environmental degradation in freshwater environments. Location The Mid-Atlantic Highlands region of the USA (36 – 42 °[*]N, 74 – 82 °[*]E) and Finland in northern Europe (60 – 68 °[*]N, 20 – 32 °[*]E). Methods We used null models, occupancy analyses, ordinations and multitaxon niche models to assess how β of stream macroinvertebrate assemblages in two biogeographically distinct regions responded to <b>environmental</b> <b>alteration</b> and what mechanisms were most likely to have caused the observed differences in β. Results Macroinvertebrate assemblages at anthropogenically disturbed sites were significantly more dissimilar from one another than were reference sites, a result contrary to those reported in several other studies. In this study, anthropogenic disturbances decreased the regional prevalence of most common taxa and increased the prevalence of several less common taxa. These differences in taxon occupancies and β between the reference condition and disturbed streams are unlikely {{to be the result of}} a single mechanism, although environmental filtering was probably of primary importance. Main conclusions The effects of anthropogenic disturbance on assemblage composition can be variable and probably depend on: initial ecological conditions; the magnitude, type and uniformity of <b>environmental</b> <b>alteration</b> occurring in a region; and the sensitivity of individual taxa. It is unlikely that β is controlled by a single mechanism, and these variable mechanisms may have diverse effects on taxon occupancies and hence β.

Food-borne trematodiases usually occur focally, are still per-sistently endemic {{in some parts of}} the world, and are most prevalent in remote rural places among school-age children, low-wage earners, and women of child-bearing age. Intestinal fluke diseases are aggravated by socio-economic factors such as poverty, malnutrition, an explosively growing free-food market, a lack of sufficient food inspection and sanitation, other helminthiases, and declining economic conditions. Control programs implemented for food-borne zoonoses and sustained in endemic areas are not fully successful for intestinal food-borne trematodiases because of centuries-old traditions of eating raw or insufficiently cooked food, widespread zoonotic reservoirs, promiscuous defecation, and the use of ‘‘night soil’ ’ (human excrement collected from la-trines) as fertilizer.
