40|$|Background. Legumes {{are usually}} {{consumed}} when physiologically mature, as dry seeds, however, <b>flageolet</b> <b>beans</b> seeds are also consumed immature. They are harvested when {{dry matter content}} is about 40 %, pods are filled, grown, seeds succulent, showing green or light green colour and do not require lengthy thermal processing when prepared for con-sumption. Material and methods. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate vitamin C content in imma-ture seeds of five bean cultivars harvested when dry matter content was 40 %. The analysis included raw, blanched and cooked fresh seeds and three products prepared for consump-tion after 0, 4, 8 and 12 months of storage: frozen products obtained using the traditional method (blanching–freezing–frozen storage–cooking), frozen products obtained using a modified method (cooking–freezing–frozen storage–thawing and heating in a micro-wave oven), a ready-to-eat product to consumption at ambient temperature, and canned products obtained by sterilization. Results. The application of technological processes, frozen and sterilized products stor-age, and the preparation for consumption had a cumulative effect in retention vitamin C content on final products. Conclusion. Comparing frozen seeds obtained by modified method with seeds treated by traditional method, generally, this one could retain more vitamin C. Canned seeds retained significantly less vitamin C than other frozen products. Key words: flageolet bean seeds, vitamin C, cooking, freezing, frozen storage, cannin...|$|E
50|$|The <b>flageolet</b> <b>bean</b> is {{a variety}} of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) {{originating}} from France. The flageolet is picked before full maturity and dried in the shade to retain its green color. The bean is small, light green, and kidney-shaped. The texture is firm and creamy when shelled and cooked.|$|R
5000|$|Phaseolus vulgaris, {{the common}} bean (also {{known as the}} string <b>bean,</b> field <b>bean,</b> <b>flageolet</b> <b>bean,</b> French bean, garden bean, green bean, haricot bean, pop bean, snap bean, or snap), is a {{herbaceous}} annual plant grown worldwide for its edible dry seed (known as just [...] "beans") or unripe fruit (green beans). The main categories of common beans, {{on the basis of}} uses, are dry beans (seeds harvested at complete maturity), snap beans (tender pods with reduced fibre harvested before the seed development phase) and shell beans (seeds harvested at physiological maturity). Its leaf is also occasionally used as a vegetable and the straw as fodder. Its botanical classification, along with other Phaseolus species, is {{as a member of the}} legume family Fabaceae, most of whose members acquire the nitrogen they require through an association with rhizobia, a species of nitrogen-fixing bacteria.|$|R
40|$|The {{flageolet}} {{is a type}} {{of common}} bean that was originally developed in France, in the 18 th century. It is known as Flageolet "vert" of Green Flageolet and it was first obtained by a French grower called Chevrier, in Brétigny-sur-Orge, a suburb of Paris, around 1878 (Porcher, 2005). Its most remarkable feature is its seed, smaller than other kidney bean seeds, and of an attractive pale green color, a rare trait within the common bean germplasm. The objective of this research was to evaluate the agronomic performance of local varieties of <b>flageolet</b> <b>bean</b> as the beginning of a breeding program focused to the selection of breeding lines to be grown by farmers in Northwestern Spain as new commercial varieties under the regulation of "Dessignation of Origin - Lourenzá" (Anonymous, 2004). This research was supported by the grants PGIDIT 02 RAG 40301 PR (Galician Government) and AGL 2005 - 01268 /AGR (Spanish Government). Peer reviewe...|$|R
