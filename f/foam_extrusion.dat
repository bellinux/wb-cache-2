40|$|Abstract. <b>Foaming</b> <b>extrusion</b> {{has been}} used to produce loose-fill starch-based {{packaging}} materials, in a similar way to the production of extruded expanded snack foods. Native starches are non-plastic due to the intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups in starch molecules, which represent their crystallinity. Thermal processing is used to disrupt and transform the semi-crystalline structure of starch granules to form a homogeneous and amorphous material. This transformation is usually accomplished using small amounts of molecular substances commonly known as gelatinization agents or plasticizers. This paper presents some results obtained during researches conducted in order to obtain a biodegradable starch-based loose-fill by thermoplastic extrusion, when using in different ratios between starch and plasticizers in the formula.

40|$|Today, <b>foam</b> <b>extrusion</b> {{is a well}} {{established}} polymer processing technology. Generally oil-based polystyrene (PS) is one standard material used for producing thermoformable extruded foam sheets with physical blowing agents (PBA).

40|$|Abstract. The use of {{polyolefin}} flexible foams {{with typical}} thicknesses between 1 and 3 mm {{produced by a}} physical <b>foaming</b> <b>extrusion</b> process is nowadays quite widespread in the packaging sector. Their high flexibility and closed-cell structure allows them to show good energy absorption properties under low loading conditions. Although the compressive response of these materials is well known, the inner microstructure developed during processing induce a high anisotropy {{that is responsible for}} their direction-dependent tensile and fracture behaviours. In this work, two different polyolefin-based foams, with densities ranging from 20 to 45 kg/m 3, were studied. The induced microstructure anisotropy was characterized by micro-Raman.

40|$|ABSTRACT: During the {{microcellular}} <b>foaming</b> <b>extrusion</b> process, {{the cell}} density in the foam could be increased by shear effects due to improved shear energy, which {{contributes to the}} free energy for bubble nucleation. However, the cells might also be deformed when the shear stress is high. In order to increase the cell density without destroying the cell structure, mechanical vibration induced by electromagnetic field is introduced into the foaming process. A novel electromagnetic dynamic foaming simulator {{has been designed to}} investigate the effects of vibration amplitude and frequency on cell density and cell morphology of foam samples during the dynamic foaming process for polystyrene (PS) microcellular plastics when using supercritical carbon dioxide (ScCO 2) as a blowing agent. Optimal foaming temperature, gas mixing time, and appropriate shear rate are also investigated when using the dynamic foaming simulator. It was found that excessive shear effects in the stable foaming process will stretch the cells in the direction of shear stress and decrease the cell density. However, when the vibration is introduced into the foaming process at optimal foamin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{experimental}} study {{deals with the}} effect of modification of the surface layer by irradiation cross-linking on the micromechanical properties of the low-density polyethylene (LDPE) tested using the instrumented nanohardness test. The surface layer of LDPE specimen made by injection technology was modified by irradiation cross-linking using beta irradiation, which significantly influences micromechanical properties of the surface layer. Compared to the heat and chemical-heat treatment of metal materials (e. g. hardening, nitridation, case hardening), cross-linking in polymers affects the surfaces in micro layers. These micromechanical changes of the surface layer are observed in the instrumented microhardness test.
