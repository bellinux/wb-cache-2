40|$|Background. The {{notion of}} the affective system as being {{composed}} of two dimensions led Archer and colleagues {{to the development of}} the affective profiles model. The model consists of four different profiles based on combinations of individuals’ experience of high/low positive and negative affect: self-fulfilling, low affective, high affective, and self-destructive. During the past 10 years, an increasing number of studies have used this person-centered model as the backdrop for the investigation of between and within individual differences in ill-being and well-being. The most common approach to this profiling is by dividing individuals’ scores of self-reported affect using the median of the population as reference for high/low splits. However, scores just-above and just-below the median might become high and low by arbitrariness, not by reality. Thus, it is plausible to criticize the validity of this variable-oriented approach. Our aim was to compare the median splits approach with a person-oriented approach, namely, cluster analysis. Method. The participants (N = 2, 225) were recruited through Amazons’ Mechanical Turk and asked to self-report affect using the Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule. We compared the profiles’ <b>homogeneity</b> and Silhouette <b>coefficients</b> to discern differences in homogeneity and heterogeneity between approaches. We also conducted exact cell-wise analyses matching the profiles from both approaches and matching profiles and gender to investigate profiling agreement with respect to affectivity levels and affectivity and gender. All analyses were conducted using the ROPstat software. Results. The cluster approach (weighted average of cluster <b>homogeneity</b> <b>coefficients</b> = 0. 62, Silhouette coefficients = 0. 68) generated profiles with greater homogeneity and more distinctive from each other compared to the median splits approach (weighted average of cluster <b>homogeneity</b> <b>coefficients</b> = 0. 75, Silhouette coefficients = 0. 59). Most of the participants (n = 1, 736, 78. 0 %) were allocated to the same profile (Rand Index =. 83), however, 489 (21. 98 %) were allocated to different profiles depending on the approach. Both approaches allocated females and males similarly in three of the four profiles. Only the cluster analysis approach classified men significantly more often than chance to a self-fulfilling profile (type) and females less often than chance to this very same profile (antitype). Conclusions. Although the question whether one approach is more appropriate than the other is still without answer, the cluster method allocated individuals to profiles that are more in accordance with the conceptual basis of the model and also to expected gender differences. More importantly, regardless of the approach, our findings suggest that the model mirrors a complex and dynamic adaptive system...|$|R

The main {{purpose of the present study}} was to test the hypothesis that distraction is adaptive when combined with active acceptance, but maladaptive when combined with avoidant strategies. A non-clinical community sample of adults (N = 638) and a clinical sample (N = 172) completed measures of emotion regulation and well-being. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to identify subgroups with different profiles on six emotion regulation variables, and these subgroups were then compared on well-being (positive and negative emotionality, and life quality) and on clinical status. A nine-cluster solution was chosen on the basis of explained variance and <b>homogeneity</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Two of these clusters had almost identical scores on distraction, but showed otherwise very different profiles (distraction combined with acceptance vs. distraction combined with avoidance). The distraction-acceptance cluster scored significantly higher than the distraction-avoidance cluster on all measures of well-being; it was also under-represented in the clinical sample, whereas the distraction-avoidance cluster was over-represented.

The rate {{of growth}} of data in an {{information}} system is exponential every year, hence data base of an information system become huge, and the number of association rules extracted from these data bases is too many.

Prior to the knowledge extraction from a set of association rules, determination of their interest plays a vital role. Since quality rules can only lead to extract implicit knowledge.

40|$|Purpose: This work {{investigated}} several topics {{related to}} dosimetry in soft tissue from fluoroscopic X-ray beams; first, it investigated the X-ray beam spectra and air kerma rates available {{for clinical use}} on state-of-the-art fluoroscopes using spectral (copper [Cu]) filtration; second, it investigated the fluoroscopic X-ray beam characteristics of first half-value layer (HVL), second HVL, <b>homogeneity</b> <b>coefficients</b> (HCs), and backscatter factors (BSFs) across {{the full range of}} available beam qualities; and third, it investigated the energy dependence of kerma-area-product (KAP) -meters measuring the radiation output of the fluoroscope. Materials and Methods: A state-of-the-art Siemens Artis Zee fluoroscope was operated in the service mode to allow for manual control of the technique factors (kVp, mA, ms, and Cu). Free-in-air measurements were made to determine HVLs and KAP-meter accuracy. BSFs were determined across a large range of X-ray field sizes and beam spectra with polymethyl-methacrylate. Percent depth doses (PDDs) and X-ray beam profiles were acquired across a similar range of X-ray beam spectra using a PTW water tank and a Spokas ionization chamber for the PDD measurements and a solid state dosimeter for the beam profile measurements. Results: Fluoroscopic dose rate and technique parameter curves are reported for several state-of-the-art fluoroscopes, illustrating differences in approach among vendors and establishing the basis for investigation of the X-ray beam characteristics (HVLs, HCs, BSFs, and PDDs). These X-ray beam characteristics are reported across a large range of clinically available X-ray beam spectra, providing the necessary foundation for dosimetry in soft tissue from these beams. Additionally, the accuracy of the displayed Ka,r and correction coefficients determined using the American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group 190 methodology is reported across a similar range of X-ray beam spectra. Conclusion: The content of this research provides the necessary foundation for determining radiation dose at depth in soft tissue from state-of-the-art fluoroscopes. The results from this research can be used to assess dose at depth in soft tissue from fluoroscopically guided interventions, to determine fetal dosimetry from fluoroscopically guided interventions, and to validate dose modeling software...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} <b>homogeneity</b> of <b>coefficients</b> in high-dimensional regression, which extends the {{sparsity}} concept {{and is more}} general and suitable for many applications. Homogeneity arises when one expects regression coefficients corresponding to neighboring geographical regions or a similar cluster of covariates to be approximately the same.

In this article, we propose a new method called clustering algorithm in regression via data-driven segmentation (CARDS) to explore homogeneity. New mathematics are provided on the gain {{that can be achieved}} by exploring homogeneity. Statistical properties of two versions of CARDS are analyzed. In particular, the asymptotic normality of our proposed CARDS estimator is established, which reveals better estimation accuracy for homogeneous parameters than that without homogeneity exploration. When our methods are combined with sparsity exploration, further efficiency can be achieved beyond the exploration of sparsity alone. This provides additional insights into the power of exploring low-dimensional strucuture in high-dimensional regression: homogeneity and sparsity.

Quality of the X-ray beam that can be expressed by Half-Value Layer (HVL), are important indices for this type of treatment effective energy of photon and <b>Homogeneity</b> <b>Coefficient</b> (HC). Materials and Methods The HC of the superficial X-ray machine at 180 kVp was determined by an experimental method and also by simulation (EGSnrc code) and the results were compared. The exposure after the first (0. 5 mmCu) and second (1 mmCu) attenuation layers were measured by Farmer dosimeter for three different field sizes. The HC was derived from these experimental data and was compared with corresponding results acquired by EGSnrc code package. The BEAMnrc code was used to transport photons and electrons at exit level of the applicator, DOSXYZnrc code for calculation of absorbed dose in the phantom, and BEAMDP for drawing the output spectra. Results Results showed that the mean percentage difference of errors obtained by experimental data and simulation method is 3. 3 % and the average energy of output spectra in 180 kVp after passing through filters and attenuation layers increases to 15. 3 % to 25. 4 %. Conclusion The maximum percentage difference of errors for the applied methods is higher than analogous devolves elsewhere reports which could be due to setup parameters such as SSD and field size.

40|$|Actuality of {{this work}} is related to human {{radiation}} safety during tuning and regulation of X-ray devices {{in the process of}} their development and production. The more precise the calculations for the device are, the less time is required for its tuning and regulation, and thus people are less exposed to radiation. When developing an X-ray device, it is necessary to choose an X-ray tube and filters taking into account the application domain of the device. In order to do this, one should know anode voltage, X-ray tube anode current, material and thickness of filters, i. e. to calculate these characteristics at the set quality of X-ray radiation. The known published studies do not give any solution to this problem. The scientific novelty {{of this work}} is that it establishes the interdependence between main characteristics of the X-ray device: the function of the device defines the quality of X-ray radiation (mean photon energy and air kerma power); mean photon energy depends on the X-ray anode tube voltage and spectral resolution; air kerma power depends on anode tube voltage, current of X-ray tube anode, spectral resolution, thicknesses of the filters and their materials; spectral resolution depends on thicknesses of filters and their materials; thickness of filters depends on the material of the filter (the linear coefficient of weakening of X-ray radiation). Knowledge of interdependence of basic characteristics of the X-ray devices allowes developing simple algorithm for their calculation at the values of <b>homogeneity</b> <b>coefficient</b> from 0, 8 to 1, which makes it possible to choose an X-ray tube and filters with the purpose of obtaining X-ray radiation of the set quality...|$|E

Measurement of such impact can be performed by means of questionnaires, such as the Kohnen Restless Legs Syndrome–Quality of Life questionnaire (KRLS-QoL), a specific 12 -item instrument that is self-applied by patients. The present study is aimed at performing a first formal validation study of this instrument. MethodsEight hundred ninety-one patients were included for analysis. RLS severity was assessed by the International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS), Restless Legs Syndrome- 6 scales (RLS- 6), and Clinical Global Impression of Severity. In addition the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was assessed. Acceptability, dimensionality, scaling assumptions, reliability, precision, hypotheses-related validity, and responsiveness were tested. ResultsThere were missing data in 3. 58 % patients. Floor and ceiling effects were low for the subscales, global evaluation, and summary index derived from items 1 to 11 after checking that scaling assumptions were met. Exploratory parallel factor analysis showed that the KRLS-QoL may be deemed unidimensional, ie, that all components of the scale are part of one overall general quality of life factor. Indexes of internal consistency (alpha[*]=[*] 0. 88), item-total correlation (rS[*]=[*] 0. 32 – 0. 71), item <b>homogeneity</b> <b>coefficient</b> (0. 41), and scale stability (ICC[*]=[*] 0. 73) demonstrated a satisfactory reliability of the KRLS-QoL.

40|$|The RS 2400 {{irradiator}} {{has been}} looked to {{as a replacement}} for discontinued gamma irradiators. The RS 2400 has a cylindrical, rather than point, x-ray source, which yields higher dose rates. The irradiator unit allows the user to set the current, voltage, and time for which the sample is to be irradiated, but gives no conversion between these values and the dose delivered. Working with Mississippi State University?s Experimental Seafood Processing Laboratory (ESPL), the purpose of this research was to characterize the dose delivered by the RS 2400 for typical operating conditions. The RS 2400 exposure rate increases, as expected, as the current and voltage are increased. The x-ray beam is uniform within 10 % at the surface of the x-ray tube over a wide range of voltages, {{with the exception of the}} leftmost 5 cm of the tube, where structural supports are located. At the maximum operating parameters (150 kV and 45 mA), the beam has a first half value layer (HVL 1) of 13. 66 mm aluminum, a <b>homogeneity</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 0. 47, and equivalent photon energy (hveq) of 88. 5 keV. This suggests a broad energy x-ray beam. The maximum deliverable dose rate to tissue at the surface of the x-ray tube is 65 Gy min- 1 ? 3. 1 %, but it is unlikely that any sample will ever be irradiated this close to the x-ray tube. The standard sample canisters are 7. 62 cm in diameter and the maximum deliverable dose rate to tissue at the canister location (with no canister present) is 37 Gy min- 1 ? 3. 1 %. This is similar to the 45 Gy min- 1 value that Rad Source Technologies, Inc. gives for the irradiator. Irradiation of live oysters is of primary interest to the ESPL. For irradiation, oysters will most likely be placed in the 10. 2 cm diameter plastic canisters since the 7. 62 cm diameter canisters are not wide enough to hold larger oysters. The oyster shells and increased distance from the x-ray source reduce the maximum deliverable dose rate to 14. 1 Gy min- 1 ? 6. 5 % for thin-shelled oysters and 12. 3 Gy min- 1 ? 6. 2 % for thick-shelled oysters...|$|E

For both species, the same proportion of the observed variability for ring density {{can be explained by}} growth traits and genetic origin (respectively 54 % and 57 %). But the most explanatory factors are very different among the species: in Norway spruce, the ring width variable explains most part of the density variation, while in Douglas-fir the weight of genetic variability of ring density itself is much bigger. To explore such a relationship, we used a more refined description of the ring density profile than the usual earlywood-latewood model. This method was based on wavelets decom-position.

The present study confirmed a correlation between carbapenem use and carbapenem resistance rates at the hospital and regional levels. The impact of diversifying the range of antibiotics used against P. aeruginosa resistance was suggested by (i) a positive correlation in multivariate analysis between the above-mentioned resistance and the proportion of consumed antibiotics having a very broad spectrum of activity (coefficient = 1. 77; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 58 to 2. 96; P < 0. 01) and (ii) a negative correlation between the resistance and diversity of antibiotic use as measured by the Peterson <b>homogeneity</b> index (<b>coefficient</b> = - 0. 52; P < 0. 05).

Some simulations investigating the finite sample performance of the estimation and test procedures are reported. Copyright Royal Economic Society, 2003...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{hierarchical}} scale that measures activity limitations in walking {{in patients with}} lower-extremity disorders who live at home. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Orthopedic workshops and outpatient clinics of secondary and tertiary care centers. Participants: Patients (N= 981; mean +/- age standard deviation, 58. 6 +/- 15. 4 y; 46 % men) living at home, with different lower-extremity disorders: stroke, poliomyelitis, osteoarthritis, amputation, complex regional pain syndrome type 1, and diabetic and degenerative foot disorders. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: (1) Fit of the monotone homogeneity model, indicating whether items {{can be used for}} measuring patients; (2) fit of the double monotorricity model, indicating invariant (hierarchical) item ordering; (3) intratest reliability, indicating repeatability of the sum score; (4) robustness, addressing the clinimetric properties within subgroups of patients; and (5) differential item functioning, addressing the validity of comparisons between subgroups of patients. Results: Thirty-five of 41 dichotomous items had (1) good fit of the monotone <b>homogeneity</b> model (<b>coefficient</b> H=. 50), (2) good fit of the double monotorricity model (coefficient H-T=. 33), (3) good intratest reliability (coefficient p=. 95), (4) satisfactory robustness (within subgroups of patients defined by age, sex, and diagnosis), and (5) some differential item functioning (6 items in amputees compared with nonamputees). Conclusions: A hierarchical scale, with excellent scaling characteristics, was developed to measure activity limitations in walking in patients with lower-extremity disorders who live at home. The measurements should be interpreted cautiously when making comparisons between amputees and nonamputees...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken to demonstrate, with correlational evidence, that presenting the rod-and-fi’ame test (RFT) with either limited (tachistoscopic) or unlimited (Oltman’s, 1968, porta-ble RFT) exposure time does not significantly affect the ranking of subjects. The underlying hypothesiis {{is that the}} intersubject variability of performance on the portable RFT is due essen-tially to differences in sensitivity to the optostatic vection that appears automatically and almost immediately. Results of the tachistoscopic test show {{that the effect of}} angular size of the stimu-lus is similar to that described in the literature for unlimited time situations, and that subjects’ ranking is very similar regardless of the exposure time (W =. 80). However, although a differ-ence is observed between the means of low and high achievers in beth types of RFT, intraindividual intertask <b>homogeneity</b> (correlation <b>coefficient)</b> is not verified in each of these subgroups. From these results, one can distinguish two processes in the RFT: the first, vections, {{has to do with the}} subject’s postural orientation and seems to play a great role in organizing interindividual differences. The second process, a more cognitive one, has a less striking effect and has to do with the selection of reference frames in perceptual organization. The vertical adjustment of a rod inside a tilted frame (rod-and-frame test, or RFT) produces deviations in the same direction as the orientation of the frame (Witkin & Asch, 1948).

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 6 th Annual Symposium on Graduate Research and Scholarly Projects (GRASP) held at the Hughes Metropolitan Complex, Wichita State University, April 23, 2010. Research completed at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, College of Liberal Arts and SciencesA multivariate linear regression model Y~N (βM',Σ) is considered {{where some of the}} rows in the coefficient matrix β are constrained by synchronized order restrictions. A test scheme is derived for the <b>homogeneity</b> of the <b>coefficient</b> matrix using the likelihood-ratio test procedure under the assumption that the coefficient matrix Σ is known. When Σ is unknown, a new ad-hoc test statistic TH(Y) is proposed by replacing the covariance matrix with its estimator, where H is a non-empty subset of the row-index space { 1, 2, [...] .,p}. The properties of TH(Y) are studied and a theorem is also stated on the distribution of TH(Y) which eventually helps us to estimate p-values using the Monte-Carlo method by simulation...|$|R
40|$|Bismuth {{telluride}} is the state-of-the-art thermoelectric (TE) {{material for}} cooling applications with {{a figure of}} merit of 1 at 300 K. There {{is a need for}} the development of TE materials based on the concept of thick films for miniaturized devices due to mechanical and manufacturing constraints for the thermoelement dimensions. We have reported earlier a method for the fabrication of high quality nanostructured bismuth telluride thick films with thickness from 100 to 350 μm based on electrochemical deposition techniques. In this paper, annealing is performed to further improve the TE performance of the nanostructured bismuth telluride thick films and n/p-type solid solutions are successfully fabricated by doping Se and Sb, respectively. The conditions for both annealing and doping for the thick films are investigated and the effects of annealing and doping on morphology, crystalline phase, grain size, Seebeck <b>coefficient,</b> <b>homogeneity,</b> electrical conductivity, and power factor of the bismuth telluride thick films have been studied...|$|R
40|$|Least squares bias in {{autoregression}} {{and dynamic}} panel regression {{is shown to}} be exacerbated in case of cross section dependence. The bias is substantial and is shown to have serious effects in applications like HAC estimation and dynamic half-life response estimation. To address the bias problem, this paper develops a panel approach to median unbiased estimation {{that takes into account}} cross section dependence. The new estimators given here considerably reduce the effects of bias and gain precision from estimating cross section error correlation. The paper also develops an asymptotic theory for tests of <b>coefficient</b> <b>homogeneity</b> under cross section dependence, and proposes a modiÞed Hausman test to test for the presence of homogeneous unit roots. An orthogonalization procedure is developed to remove cross section dependence and permit the use of conventional and meta unit root tests with panel data.
