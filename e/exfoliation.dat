5|$|Psoriasis vulgaris (also {{known as}} chronic {{stationary}} psoriasis or plaque-like psoriasis) {{is the most}} common form and affects 85%–90% of people with psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis typically appears as raised areas of inflamed skin covered with silvery-white scaly skin. These areas are called plaques and are most commonly found on the elbows, knees, scalp, and back. Psoriatic erythroderma (erythrodermic psoriasis) involves widespread inflammation and <b>exfoliation</b> of the skin over most of the body surface. It may be accompanied by severe itching, swelling, and pain. It is often the result of an exacerbation of unstable plaque psoriasis, particularly following the abrupt withdrawal of systemic glucocorticoids. This form of psoriasis can be fatal as the extreme inflammation and <b>exfoliation</b> disrupt the body's ability to regulate temperature and perform barrier functions.|$|E
5|$|The {{uplifting}} {{and increased}} erosion exposed granitic {{rocks in the}} area to surface pressures, resulting in <b>exfoliation</b> (responsible for the rounded shape of the many domes in the park) and mass wasting following the numerous fracture joint planes (cracks; especially vertical ones) in the now solidified plutons. Pleistocene glaciers further accelerated this process and the larger ones transported the resulting talus and till from valley floors.|$|E
5|$|Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, {{are created}} by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is {{responsible}} for creating valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force {{over the last few}} million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). <b>Exfoliation</b> (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and inset arches like Royal Arches.|$|E
5|$|Such large {{temperature}} variations have {{a destructive}} {{effect on the}} exposed rocky surfaces. The repeated fluctuations put a strain on exposed rock and the flanks of mountains crack and shatter. Fragmented strata slide down into the valleys where they continue to break into pieces due to the relentless sun by day and chill by night. Successive strata are exposed to further weathering. The relief of the internal pressure that has built up in rocks that have been underground for aeons can cause them to shatter. <b>Exfoliation</b> also occurs when the outer surfaces of rocks split off in flat flakes. This {{is believed to be}} caused by the stresses put on the rock by repeated expansions and contractions which induces fracturing parallel to the original surface. Chemical weathering processes probably play a more important role in deserts than was previously thought. The necessary moisture may be present in the form of dew or mist. Ground water may be drawn to the surface by evaporation and the formation of salt crystals may dislodge rock particles as sand or disintegrate rocks by <b>exfoliation.</b> Shallow caves are sometimes formed at the base of cliffs by this means.|$|E
5|$|The main {{disadvantage}} to {{die casting}} {{is the very}} high capital cost. Both the casting equipment required and the dies and related components are very costly, as compared to most other casting processes. Therefore, to make die casting an economic process, a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages are that the process is limited to high-fluidity metals, and casting weights must be between 30grams (1oz) and 10kg (20lb). In the standard die casting process the final casting will have {{a small amount of}} porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and <b>exfoliation</b> of the surface. Thus a related disadvantage of die casting is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable. Parts needing hardening (through hardening or case hardening) and tempering are not cast in dies.|$|E
25|$|One {{disadvantage}} to <b>exfoliation</b> is {{the high}} price of some of the products and methods used to achieve it. <b>Exfoliation</b> will lead to some initial redness to the skin. Near the end of chemical peels, the skin will frost, with colors varying from a bright white to grey on the skin surface.|$|E
25|$|<b>Exfoliation</b> is {{achieved}} through either mechanical or chemical means.|$|E
25|$|Daily extreme {{temperature}} variations create fractures by repeated expansion and contraction {{of the rock}} in a process called thermal stress weathering. The thermal stresses can cause deep cracks that split the rock into separate pieces in an erosional process called thermal <b>exfoliation.</b> Precipitation causes dissolution of the fine crystalline grains that bind the larger particles together, which is known as chemical weathering. Freezing water expands in fractures making them wider and deeper in a process called frost weathering. Gravity exerts a constant downward force that creates new fractures and separates the formations along existing fractures in a process called stress relief <b>exfoliation.</b> High speed winds remove any loose grains from the formations and wind-borne particulates sandblast the surfaces making them smoother.|$|E
25|$|These {{molecular}} simulations {{have been}} used to understand the material removal mechanisms, effects of tool geometry, temperature, and process parameters such as cutting speed and cutting forces. It was also used to investigate the mechanisms behind the <b>exfoliation</b> of few layers of graphene and carbon nanoscrolls.|$|E
25|$|Vermiculite is a hydrous {{phyllosilicate}} mineral. It undergoes significant expansion when heated. <b>Exfoliation</b> {{occurs when}} the mineral is heated sufficiently, and the effect is routinely produced in commercial furnaces. Vermiculite is formed by weathering or hydrothermal alteration of biotite or phlogopite. Large commercial vermiculite mines currently exist in Russia, South Africa, China, and Brazil.|$|E
25|$|In its {{soundbite}} diffusion {{through the}} channels of marketeers and popular media, who eagerly and constantly reminded their audience that the metrosexual was straight, the metrosexual has congealed {{into something more}} digestible for consumers: a heterosexual male who is {{in touch with his}} feminine side—he color-coordinates, cares deeply about <b>exfoliation,</b> and has perhaps manscaped.|$|E
25|$|Chemical peels are {{chemicals}} which {{destroy the}} epidermis {{in a controlled}} manner, leading to <b>exfoliation</b> and the alleviation of certain skin conditions, including superficial acne scars. Various chemicals can be used depending upon {{the depth of the}} peel, and caution should be used, particularly for dark-skinned individuals and those individuals susceptible to keloid formation or with active infections.|$|E
25|$|Rice bran is {{sometimes}} {{added to the}} guano {{for the purpose of}} <b>exfoliation.</b> The powder is mixed with water yielding a paste. The paste is massaged into the skin {{for a few minutes and}} then it is rinsed off. The facial is usually rather odorless and sanitized. The added rice bran can also neutralize the slight musky odor.|$|E
25|$|High-frequency {{treatment}} uses low-current high-frequency alternating currents, delivered via a glass electrode. Because {{the high}} frequency current converts {{some of the}} oxygen in the air into ozone, the treatment has a germicidal action, and is also drying and warming. Consequently, the treatment is used to aid healing and also to help desquamation (the skin's natural <b>exfoliation)</b> and stimulate sweat and sebaceous glands.|$|E
25|$|As {{microbead}} particles used {{in mechanical}} <b>exfoliation</b> {{are too small}} (less than 1mm) to be caught by sewage works, this results in tonnes of microbeads being released into the environment, which damages marine ecosystems. Consequently, in June 2014 the US state Illinois became the first to ban the use of microbeads, and cosmetics manufacturers such as L'Oreal, Johnson & Johnson, and Colgate agreed to use more natural ingredients.|$|E
25|$|The Chief's rock faces, {{especially}} the Grand Wall, exhibit the unique textural patterns which {{result from the}} process of granitic <b>exfoliation.</b> This is the natural means by which large, high-quality granite formations weather, erode, and age. Rather than crumbling and slowly wearing away, large flakes of granite tend to shear off and drop from the face in layers. On impact with the ground below, the shattered flakes become boulders and talus.|$|E
25|$|Just {{like the}} {{cornified}} layer of epidermis and of any mammalian nail, the hoof capsule is created only from epidermis, the outer living {{layer of the}} skin. From a microscopic point of view, epidermis is a multi-layered, specialised cornifying epithelium. It overlays the dermis, and it is separated from it by a basal lamina. It has no blood vessels and living cells acquire their oxygen and nutrients by fluid exchanges and molecular diffusion, from underlying dermis, flowing into microscopical spaces among individual cells. Products of metabolism are cleared by a reverse of this process. Epidermis growth take place by mitotic activity in its deepest layer, into the basal layer, with slow outward migration and maturation of cells. As these cells approach the surface, special proteins accumulate into their cytoplasm, then the cells die and 'dry', into microscopic, tightly-connected individual layers, composed mainly of keratin. The resulting 'dead' superficial layer serves a protective function, saving underlying living tissues from injury, from dehydration and from fungal and bacterial attack. The constant thickness of the cornified layer results most commonly from regular superficial <b>exfoliation.</b> When a specialised cornified structure has a particular toughness, as in nails and hair, little or no <b>exfoliation</b> occurs and the cornified structures must slowly migrate away from their original position.|$|E
25|$|While {{the basic}} setup is simple {{relative}} {{to many other}} deposition techniques, the physical phenomena of laser-target interaction and film growth are quite complex (see Process below). When the laser pulse is absorbed by the target, energy is first converted to electronic excitation and then into thermal, chemical and mechanical energy resulting in evaporation, ablation, plasma formation and even <b>exfoliation.</b> The ejected species expand into the surrounding vacuum {{in the form of}} a plume containing many energetic species including atoms, molecules, electrons, ions, clusters, particulates and molten globules, before depositing on the typically hot substrate.|$|E
25|$|Metastasis in {{ovarian cancer}} {{is very common}} in the abdomen, and occurs via <b>exfoliation,</b> where cancer cells burst through the ovarian capsule {{and are able to}} move freely {{throughout}} the peritoneal cavity. Ovarian cancer metastases usually grow on the surface of organs rather than the inside; they are also common on the omentum and the peritoneal lining. Cancer cells can also travel through the lymphatic system and metastasize to lymph nodes connected to the ovaries via blood vessels; i.e. the lymph nodes along the infundibulopelvic ligament, the broad ligament, and the round ligament. The most commonly affected groups include the paraaortic, hypogastric, external iliac, obturator, and inguinal lymph nodes. Usually, ovarian cancer does not metastasize to the liver, lung, brain, or kidneys unless it is recurrent disease; this differentiates ovarian cancer from many other forms of cancer.|$|E

500|$|The public baths served hygienic, {{social and}} {{cultural}} functions. Bathing {{was the focus of}} daily socializing in the late afternoon before dinner. Roman baths were distinguished by a series of rooms that offered communal bathing in three temperatures, with varying amenities that might include an exercise and weight-training room, sauna, <b>exfoliation</b> spa (where oils were massaged into the skin and scraped from the body with a strigil), ball court, or outdoor swimming pool. Baths had hypocaust heating: the floors were suspended over hot-air channels that circulated warmth. Mixed nude bathing was not unusual in the early Empire, though some baths may have offered separate facilities or hours for men and women. Public baths were a part of urban culture throughout the provinces, but in the late 4th century, individual tubs began to replace communal bathing. Christians were advised to go to the baths for health and cleanliness, not pleasure, but to avoid the games (ludi), which were part of religious festivals they considered [...] "pagan". Tertullian says that otherwise Christians not only availed themselves of the baths, but participated fully in commerce and society.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Exfoliation</b> {{involves}} {{the removal of}} the oldest dead skin cells on the skin's outermost surface. [...] <b>Exfoliation</b> is involved in the process of all facials, during microdermabrasion or chemical peels. <b>Exfoliation</b> can be achieved through mechanical or chemical means.|$|E

2500|$|Credit {{is given}} to the ancient Egyptians for the {{practice}} of <b>exfoliation.</b> In the Middle Ages, wine was used as a chemical exfoliant, with tartaric acid as the active agent. [...] In Asia, the practice of <b>exfoliation</b> started hundreds of years ago. The etymology of the word exfoliate comes from the Latin exfoliare (to strip off leaves).|$|E

2500|$|This process {{involves}} physically {{scrubbing the}} skin with an abrasive. [...] Mechanical exfoliants include microfiber cloths, adhesive <b>exfoliation</b> sheets, micro-bead facial scrubs, crepe paper, crushed apricot kernel or almond shells, sugar or salt crystals, pumice, and abrasive {{materials such as}} sponges, loofahs, brushes, and simply fingernails. [...] Facial scrubs are available in over-the-counter products for application by the user. [...] People with dry skin should avoid exfoliants which include {{a significant portion of}} pumice, or crushed volcanic rock. Pumice is considered a good material to exfoliate the skin of the feet. [...] Microdermabrasion is another mechanical method of <b>exfoliation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Chemical exfoliants include scrubs {{containing}} salicylic acid, glycolic acid, fruit enzymes, citric acid, or {{malic acid}} {{which may be}} applied in high concentrations by a medical professional, or in lower concentrations in over-the-counter products. Chemical <b>exfoliation</b> may involve the use of products that contain alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), or enzymes that act to loosen the glue-like substance that holds the cells together, allowing them to ease away. This type of <b>exfoliation</b> is recommended for people treating acne. [...] In beauty spa treatment on continental Europe, the chemical properties of wine producing grapes are exploited {{in the practice of}} vinotherapy which is becoming increasingly popular.|$|E
2500|$|In pseudoexfoliation {{glaucoma}} (also, PEX, <b>exfoliation</b> glaucoma) {{the pressure}} {{is due to the}} accumulation of microscopic granular protein fibers, which can block normal drainage of the aqueous humor. [...] PEX is prevalent in Scandinavia, primarily in those over 70, and more commonly in women.|$|E
2500|$|Sand or pumice may {{be added}} to produce a [...] soap. The {{scouring}} agents serve to remove dead cells from the skin surface being cleaned. This process is called <b>exfoliation.</b> Many newer materials that are effective, yet {{do not have the}} sharp edges and poor particle size distribution of pumice, are used for exfoliating soaps.|$|E
2500|$|The {{similarities}} to graphite {{also include the}} possibility of scotch-tape delamination (<b>exfoliation),</b> resulting in phosphorene, an anisotropic, graphene-like material with excellent charge transport properties [...] and high (~100 Wm−1K−1) thermal conductivity. Exfoliated black phosphorus sublimes at 400°C in vacuum. It gradually oxidizes when exposed to water {{in the presence of}} oxygen, which is a concern when contemplating it as a material for the manufacture of transistors, for example.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{significant}} glacial {{features include}} Tehipite Dome, the largest granite dome in the Sierra, rising [...] {{above the floor}} of Tehipite Valley. In Kings Canyon and across the high country, such sheer granite cliffs are subject to <b>exfoliation,</b> frost weathering and earthquakes which cause sudden and dramatic rockfalls. Over thousands of years, cliff collapses have built up large talus piles or scree slopes at their bases along almost every glacial valley in the park.|$|E
2500|$|Regular use of {{lip balm}} and moisturizer is {{recommended}} throughout {{a course of}} treatment to reduce these problems. The dose {{may need to be}} decreased to reduce the severity of these side effects. [...] The skin becomes more fragile—especially to frictional forces—and may not heal as quickly as normal. For this reason waxing of hair, tattooing, tattoo removal, piercings, dermabrasion, <b>exfoliation,</b> etc. are not recommended. Treatment of acne scars is generally deferred until 12 months after completion of a course of isotretinoin.|$|E
2500|$|Enchanted Rock is a {{geographical}} landmark [...] north of Fredericksburg in Llano County. The rock is a huge, pink granite <b>exfoliation</b> dome that rises [...] above the surrounding land, has a summit elevation of [...] above sea level, and covers [...] It {{is one of}} the largest batholiths (underground rock formation uncovered by erosion) in the United States, and was declared a National Natural Landmark in 1970. In 1994, the State of Texas opened it as Enchanted Rock State Natural Area after adding facilities. The same year, Enchanted Rock was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
2500|$|The north wall of Little Yosemite has {{not been}} {{subject to the same}} kinds of glacial planing as the south wall because the granite rocks of Moraine Dome and Sugar Bowl Dome are tougher and more resistant. [...] This is {{remarkable}} considering that it is likely that Little Yosemite was not only scoured repeatedly by glaciers that were wholly contained by the canyon, but also overrun by glaciers that overflowed the Merced canyon and spread widely into surrounding uplands with occasional surges of ice contributed over the pass from the overflowing Tuolumne River basin. [...] These rocks were thus subject to tremendous gravitational and flow forces yet retain a remarkable degree of integrity, eroding almost exclusively and superficially along <b>exfoliation</b> joints.|$|E
2500|$|Cascade Cliffs is {{a wall of}} {{unjointed}} granite {{that rises}} to [...] AMSL, [...] above the Merced River and make up the southern wall of Little Yosemite Valley at , [...] southwest of Bunnell Point and [...] northeast of Mount Starr King, of which Cascade Cliffs comprises the northern flank. [...] In few {{other places in the}} Yosemite region is the granite more continuously massive than in the Cascade Cliffs. Only one horizontal master joint divides the rock (in the lower left) The scales on the cliffs are merely surficial features due to <b>exfoliation.</b> The dark streaks indicate the paths followed by the ribbon cascades which descend from the upland in the spring, when the snow is melting, and from which the cliffs take their name.
