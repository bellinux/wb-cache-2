40|$|AbstractRural {{education}} {{is one of}} the important factors in regional development supported by the central government. Implementing policies, it facilitates the effective functioning of the new roles assumed by other actors. With decentralization, local governments will have to assume greater responsibilities and would become the focal centres for local development. Local governments have to be effectively linked with national levels as well as with local communities. They would be expected to undertake certain activities hitherto performed the central government, such as certain legal and regulatory functions and the provision of services like extension. In addition, especially with increased demand and diversification of economic activities mainly due to the growing emphasis on globalization and associated changes, they would be entrusted with extra responsibilities. As a result, these may include guiding local communities, especially at the take-off stage, facilitating the capacity-building of local communities, catalyzing the interactions between the community organizations and the organized private sector, installation of monitoring mechanisms, etc. In order to do this, we summarized critical points in rural education development. We proposed an <b>informatics</b> <b>programme</b> able to analyze the performance of the education system in regional development based on major indicators of efficiency and effectiveness...|$|R

Decisions regarding grants currently made available from the Italian Government are taken by the Steering Committee, which will operate for a period of two years in order to carry out the project goals. An Africain Committee was set up for the approval of all actions to be taken in order to get the best advantage of the available funds; the African Committee, which is destinated to survive to the RINAF project, will represent a forum whereby the African regions define the status of utilisation of information technology means in their countries along with the requirements within the RINAF project. Stefano Trumpy, Director of the CNUCE Institute of the Italian National Council of Research (CNR), has been nominated Technical Coordinator of the RINAF Project.

An inventory of Swedish Systems Science and <b>Informatics</b> <b>programmes</b> has been conducted. The inventory has identified over 60 educational programmes within the field {{with a wide variety of}} labels. The field is quite broad and education can lead to a number of different professional roles.

All Swedish universities providing Systems Science education has been invited to participate in the network. In addition to the universities initially participating, another eight universities have elected to join the network. During the network project, three physical meetings have taken place, focussing on student mobility, learning outcomes, differences and likenesses between different educational programmes, strategies for Bologna-adaption, cooperation between universities, the common master´s programme and the continued existence of the network. The common master´s programme (120 ECTS) started for the first time in the fall of 2007. It attracted a sufficient number of Swedish and international students.

40|$|Sirtuins, NAD-dependent deacetylases, {{are present}} in all organisms playing {{a central role in}} many {{metabolic}} pathways such as cell survival, energy metabolism, lifespan and ageing. Among the seven human sirtuins, SIRT 4 and SIRT 6 share conserved domains with the two sirtuins present in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, named SRT 1 and SRT 2. In particular SRT 1 has sequence homology to nuclear SIRT 6 while SRT 2 to mithochondrial SIRT 4. Several roles for SIRT 4 are known but recently its engagement in DNA Damage Response (DDR) has been proposed. Among metabolic pathways that limit proliferation under damage, the repression of glutamine metabolism has been demonstrated. In human cells, the transcriptional activation of Sirt 4 gene, in response to DNA-damaging agents, inhibits both glutamine entry into the cells and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity, decreasing the production of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and reducing energy for proliferation (Jeong et al, 2013). Few and contrasting data are until now available on plant SRT 2. A lysine deacetylase activity and an involvement in energy metabolism and pathogen defense have been reported for this sirtuin. In a project to search for equivalent functions of conserved genes deriving from phylogenetically distant organisms, here we present an analysis to verify if SRT 2 displays in plant the same role observed for SIRT 4 in human cells. We have evidenced by <b>informatic</b> <b>programmes</b> that the two sirtuins SIRT 4 and SRT 2 share not only aminoacid sequence but also tridimensional structure. Then we have developed an in vivo assay in Arabidopsis to monitor SRT 2 expression, cell proliferation and viability, and to evaluate glutamine metabolism. We demonstrate, in Arabidopsis seedlings, after a DNA damage treatment with camptothecin (CPT), a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor, a time and dose-dependent transcriptional activation of SRT 2 gene. In parallel, we observe an inhibited cell proliferation and a decreased GDH activity. These data suggest that SRT 2 is not only activated in the DDR, but it is also implicated in the glutamine regulation. The same parameters will be evaluated in the selected SRT 2 mutant plants obtained by TDNA insertional technique...|$|R

Aberystwyth: Department of Information Studies, University of Wales Aberystwyth Sponsorship: National Library for Health (NHS Information Authority) Executive summary The aim was to {{provide an overview of}} current training provision and CPD needs of NHS library staff, professional and paraprofessional. The project was largely conducted through desk research, with two workshops held to elicit views on training priorities and formats of training. The objectives were to: ? Synthesise lessons learned from previous training needs analyses ? Identify what worked, and what best practice might be ? Identify current and future needs. Key messages Future training needs analyses Future training needs analyses for healthcare library staff should: ? Be based on the Knowledge and Skills Framework as a competency framework, but with a vision {{similar to that of the}} Special Libraries Association (USA). ? Use a variety of methods informal focus groups or workshops to encourage interest in training, with more objective methods to identify the type of learning and skills actually required, and the appropriate level. Training provision Formal training provision should: ? Offer variety e-learning needs to be complemented by national and local provision of face-to-face training. ? Exploit opportunities for cross-sector training within the library and information sector ? Allow the trainee to build on existing skills and competencies more explicit scaffolding is required, rather than the 'quick fix?. ? Be accredited if possible Training priorities The training priorities for health library staff are: ? Research and information retrieval skills for more advanced, specialist practitioners ? Technical and knowledge management skills for those involved in intranets and outreach activities ? Leadership and strategic management skills for the managers ? More specific, specialist training for some paraprofessionals Getting skills into practice Getting skills into practice requires: ? Mentoring schemes with trained mentors, with more opportunities for health library staff to team up with those working in patient information services ? Coaching schemes for the leadership skills required, with more opportunities for health librarians to team up with health professionals ? More emphasis on action learning, and reflection on learning, to support organisational learning as well as personal learning ? More emphasis on capability, rather than just demonstration of competence NLH initiatives As general awareness of the CILIP framework and UKCHIP activities was limited, the NLH might: ? Provide briefings on the pros and cons of the CILIP framework, and UKCHIP for library staff. The workshops confirmed considerable interest in knowledge management initiatives in the NHS, but also some confusion about the way library staff could make useful contributions and plan for the future.

40|$|Background and aim To {{investigate}} {{the use of}} animation tools to aid visualisation of problems for discussion within focus groups, {{in the context of}} healthcare workers discussing electronic health records (EHRs). Method Ten healthcare staff focus groups, held in a range of organisational contexts. Each focus group was in four stages: baseline discussion, animator presentation, post-animator discussion and questionnaire. Audio recordings of the focus groups were transcribed and coded and the emergent analytic themes analysed for issues relating to EHR design and implementation. The data allowed a comparison of baseline and post-animator discussion. Results The animator facilitated discussion about EHR issues and these were thematically coded as: Workload; Sharing Information; Access to Information; Record Content; Confidentiality; Patient Consent; and Implementation. Conclusion We illustrate that use of the animator in focus groups is one means to raise understanding about a proposed EHR development. The animator provided a visual 'probe' to support a more proactive and discursive localised approach to end-user concerns, which could be part of an effective stakeholder engagement and communication strategy crucial in any EHR or health <b>informatics</b> implementation <b>programme.</b> The results of the focus groups were to raise salient issues and concerns, many of which anticipated those that have emerged in the current NHS Connecting for Health Care Records programme in England.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to suggest}} that the concept of {{clinical}} governance goes beyond a bureaucratic accountability structure and {{can be viewed as a}} negotiated balance between imperfectly aligned and sometimes conflicting goals within a complex adaptive system. On this view, the information system cannot be separated conceptually from the system of governance it supports or the people whose work it facilitates or hinders. Design/methodology/approach – The study, located within the English National Health Service (NHS) between 1999 and 2005, is case study based using a multi method approach to data collection within two primary care organisations (PCOs). The research strategy is conducted within a social constructionist ontological perspective. Findings – The findings reflect the following broad-based themes: mutual adjustment of a plurality of stakeholder perceptions, preferences and priorities; the development of information and communication systems, empowered by informatics; an emphasis on education and training to build capacity and capability. Research limitations/implications – Limitations of case study methodology include a tendency to provide selected accounts. These are potentially biased and risk trivialising findings. Rooted in specific context, their generalisability to other contexts is limited by the extent to which contexts are similar. Reasonable attempts were made to minimise any bias. The diversity of data collection methods used in the study was an attempt to counterbalance the limitations highlighted in one method by strength from alternative techniques. Practical implications – The paper makes recommendations in two key governance areas: education and learning to manage health information. In practice, the lessons learned provide opportunities to inform future approaches to health <b>informatics</b> educational <b>programmes.</b> Originality/value – With regard to topicality, it is suggested that many of the developmental issues highlighted during the establishment of quality improvement programmes within primary care organisations (PCGs/PCTs) are relevant in the light of current NHS reforms and move towards commissioning consortia...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Scottish Morbidity Database (SMR) consists of the following datasets linked together&# 58; 1981 onwards&# 58; SMR 01 – Episode level data on acute hospital admissions. 1981 onwards&# 58; SMR 04 – Episode level data on psychiatric admissions. 1980 onwards&# 58; SMR 06 – Cancer registrations. 1980 onwards&# 58; National Records of Scotland Death Records. The datasets are permanently linked together and continuously updated allowing a more comprehensive overview of aspects of their health and NHS healthcare. Records relating to the same person are held together in patient groups. There are over 37 million records held in the database. The Scottish Morbidity Database covers all patients in Scotland with non-obstetric hospital admissions together with any cancer registration and corresponding death records. The ISD holds data from 1980 onwards. Some of the datasets began prior to this time. The Scottish Morbidity Database is continuously updated when new records or episodes are generated. The dataset {{is part of a}} wide range of health related administrative data collected by the Information Services Division (ISD), on behalf of the NHS National Services Scotland (part of NHS Scotland). ISD has been the authoritative source of Scottish national healthcare statistics for over 50 years. The data is used to enhance decisions about Scottish health care to improve the health of the people of Scotland. ISD is part of the SHIP (ScottisH <b>Informatics</b> <b>Programme),</b> a Scotland wide research platform for the collation, management, dissemination and analysis of Electronic Patient Records. As part of SHIP, ISD delivers Electronic Data Research and Innovation Service (eDRIS), a one stop shop for health research designed to provide a single point of contact and to assist researchers in study design, approvals and data (non-patient or patient identifiable) access in a secure environment (the NSS National Safe Haven). The Scottish Morbidity Database data quality is of a high standard and is well populated with patients CHI numbers to allow for effective linkage to other data sources. The ISD Data Quality Assurance team is responsible for and ensuring SMR datasets are accurate, consistent and comparable across time and between sources. Information on the completeness and timeliness of all hospital activity SMR datasets is available in the Documentation section. In April 1996 diagnostic codes changed from ICD 9 to ICD 10. Further information on ICD 10 is available in the Documentation section. Research Usage and Linkage The Scottish Morbidity Database is used by NHS Scotland and the Scottish Government for planning, epidemiology, provision of service and providing comparative information to help improve efficiencies in health care services. The database is an extremely useful research tool for looking at patient pathways and follow-up, such as readmission to hospital and survival. Its public health uses also include looking at co-morbidity and relationships between diseases. The database also has the potential to be used to estimate the incidence and prevalence for a wide range of diseases involving hospital admission and/or death. The different datasets held in the Scottish Morbidity Database are linked together by ISD. Records are updated continuously using a combination of deterministic and probability matching. The Scottish Morbidity Database and the Maternity and Neonatal Linked Database can be linked together. In this way, those patients with a particular diagnosis or any other event that might be of interest can be linked to either of these databases to identify other previous or subsequent hospital activity such as admissions, deaths, cancers and pregnancies. The Scottish Morbidity Database is also linked to the Scottish Health Survey and approximately 92 % of survey respondents have given their consent to link to their health records. A variety of different linked datasets are available. An example of research using the linked Scottish Health Survey to the Scottish Morbidity Database is given in Gray et al. (2010). </div...|$|R
