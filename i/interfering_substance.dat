40|$|Infrared {{spectroscopy}} is {{the analytical}} principle incorporated into {{many of the}} latest generation of evidential breath-alcohol instruments. In Sweden, for example, the instrument approved for legal purposes is the Evidenzer, which measures a person’s breath-ethanol concentration (BEC) by means of 4 -infrared filters (3. 3 to 3. 5 micron). However, this kind of infrared technology is not completely specific for identification of ethanol and the claim is sometimes made that other volatiles present in the breath sample caused a falsely high reading. This defense argument relates to the specificity of the infrared analysis and its response to interfering substances. The volatile organic substances (VOCs) most frequently identified in blood when an <b>interfering</b> <b>substance</b> was indicated in breath were acetone, isopropanol and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK). However, {{in most of these}} cases the blood and breath samples also contained appreciable concentrations of ethanol above the legal limit for driving. Acetone and isopropanol might arise during ketogenesis in people suffering form diabetes or after eating low carbohydrate diets. Consumption of denatured alcohol spiked with acetone and other ketones can also trigger the Evidenzer to flag for an <b>interfering</b> <b>substance.</b> The evidential breath tests with Evidenzer were aborted only 27 times owing to an <b>interfering</b> <b>substance</b> (N = 24, 072 tests). Elevated concentrations of ethanol, acetone, isopropanol and/or MEK were present in most blood samples and arose from drinking denatured alcohol. The defense argument that substances in breath other than ethanol are a common occurrence in connection with evidential breath-alcohol instruments was not supported by this investigation...|$|E

Healthcare associated infections are a global issue and the need for new methods to reduce contamination and evaluate efficiency of disinfection is increasingly recognized in scientific, clinical and political communities. In order to evaluate the antibacterial efficiency of cleaning and disinfecting products, test floorings were inoculated with bacterial suspensions and an <b>interfering</b> <b>substance,</b> and wiped with a product. A unitary weight was used to standardize the wiping. The bacteria load on the surface was swabbed after wiping and the remaining bacterial load was evaluated after plate cultivation. The ATP bioluminescence analysis was used during a similar procedure to replace the plate cultivation method. The enzyme luciferase provided light emission while degrading the ATP contained into bacteria. The light emission is measured to determine the bacterial load on the surface. The compatibility of wiping materials and cleaning agents was also tested with a test suspension of S. aureus. The recovery of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa after different drying times on surfaces was studied. The results show that three disinfectants meet the requirements of the standard FprEN 1661 : DES 45, Rely+On™ Virkon® and Wet Wipe. Input was transmitted to the standard committee, especially regarding the need to sterilize the wipes, to standardize and improve the release of bacteria from the swab, and to decrease the weight of the granite block for more clinical relevance.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this project, {{real time}} {{polymerase}} chain reaction (PCR) was utilized to study the mechanism of PCR inhibition through exami-nation {{of the effect of}} amplicon length, melting temperature, and sequence. Specifically designed primers with three different amplicon lengths and three different melting temperatures were used to target a single homozygous allele in the HUMTH 01 locus. The effect on amplification efficiency for each primer pair was determined by adding different concentrations of various PCR inhibitors to the reaction mixture. The results show that a variety of inhibition mechanisms can occur during the PCR process {{depending on the type of}} co-extracted inhibitor. These include Taq inhibition, DNA template binding, and effects on reaction efficiency. In addition, some inhibitors appear to affect the reaction in more than one manner.

40|$|A simple {{procedure}} {{was developed for}} the fabrication of electrochemical glucose biosensors using glucose oxidase (GOx), with graphene or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Graphene and MWCNTs were dispersed in 0. 25 % 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and drop cast on 1 % KOH-pre-treated glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs). The EDC (1 -ethyl-(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide) -activated GOx was then bound covalently on the graphene- or MWCNT-modified GCE. Both the graphene- and MWCNT-based biosensors detected the entire pathophysiological range of blood glucose in humans, 1. 4 – 27. 9 mM.

In experiments performed following adducts were focused: deprotonated analyte adduct with sodium acetate, deprotonated analyte dimer adduct with sodium and deprotonated analyte adduct with two molecules of sodium acetate. α-hydroxybutyrate, β-hydroxybutyrate and γ-hydroxybutyrate were used as model drugs since their effective separation and detection are a real analytical challenge when γ-hydroxybutyrate is the analyte of interest.

However, β-hydroxybutyrate is not a potential <b>interfering</b> <b>substance</b> for γ-hydroxybutyrate analysis other than α-hydroxybutyrate.
