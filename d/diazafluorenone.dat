25|$|Some {{of these}} techniques, such as ninhydrin, <b>diazafluorenone</b> and vacuum metal deposition, show great {{sensitivity}} {{and are used}} operationally. Some fingerprint reagents are specific, for example ninhydrin or <b>diazafluorenone</b> reacting with amino acids. Others such as ethyl cyanoacrylate polymerisation, work apparently by water-based catalysis and polymer growth. Vacuum metal deposition using gold and zinc {{has been shown to}} be non-specific, but can detect fat layers as thin as one molecule.|$|E

Zinc complexes containing <b>diazafluorenone</b> ligands {{have been studied}} and the localisation of the single electron on the metal atom in the mono-ligated complex has been demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{introduction}} of nitrogen atoms upon the triplet excited state reactivity of 1, 4 -diaza- 9 -fluorenone (1) and 1, 4 -diaza- 9 -benz[b]fluorenone (2), in acetonitrile, was investigated employing the nanosecond laser flash photolysis technique. The intersystem crossing quantum yield (&# 934;ces) for 1 and 2 was determined using 9 -fluorenone as a secondary standard (&# 934;ces= 0. 48, in acetonitrile) and for both <b>diazafluorenones</b> a value of &# 934;ces= 0. 28 was found. Quenching rate constants ranged from 8. 17 x 10 (4) L mol- 1 s- 1 (2 -propanol) to 1. 02 x 10 (10) L mol- 1 s- 1 (DABCO) for 1, 4 -diaza- 9 -fluorenone and from 6. 95 x 10 (5) L mol- 1 s- 1 (2 -propanol) to 5. 94 x 10 (9) L mol- 1 s- 1 (DABCO) for 1, 4 -diaza- 9 -benz[b]fluorenone, depending if the quenching process involves energy, hydrogen or electron transfer. A comparison between quenching rate constants for both diazaflurenones and the parent compound, i. e. 9 -fluorenone, a ketone with lowest triple state of &# 960;&# 960;* configuration, lead {{to the conclusion that}} the reactive triplet excited state for 1, 4 -diaza- 9 -fluorenone and 1, 4 -diaza- 9 -benz[b]fluorenone has &# 960;&# 960;* configuration...|$|R
