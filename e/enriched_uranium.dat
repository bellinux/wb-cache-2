5|$|Kerst {{designed}} an aqueous {{homogeneous reactor}} in which <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> {{in the form of}} soluble uranium sulfate, was dissolved in water, and surrounded by a beryllium oxide neutron reflector. It was the first reactor to employ <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> as a fuel, and required most of the world's meager supply at the time. A sufficient quantity of <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> arrived at Los Alamos by April 1944, and the Water Boiler commenced operation in May. By the end of June it had achieved all of its design goals.|$|E
5|$|Frank Spedding's Ames Project had {{developed}} the Ames process, {{a method of}} producing uranium metal on an industrial scale, but Cyril Stanley Smith, the CM Division's associate leader in charge of metallurgy, was concerned about using it with highly <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> due to the danger of forming a critical mass. Highly <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> was also far more valuable than natural uranium, {{and he wanted to}} avoid the loss of even a milligram. He recruited Richard D. Baker, a chemist who had worked with Spedding, and together they adapted the Ames Process for use at the Los Alamos laboratory. In February Baker and his group made twenty 360 gram reductions and twenty-seven 500 gram reductions with highly <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> tetrafluoride.|$|E

5|$|Following Oppenheimer's {{reorganization}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory in July 1944, {{the work on the}} uranium gun-type weapon was concentrated in Francis Birch's O-1 (Gun) Group. The concept was pursued so that in case of a failure to develop an implosion bomb, at least the <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> could be used. Henceforth the gun-type had to work with <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted, one short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay. The new design was called Little Boy.|$|E
5|$|The S-50 Project was the Manhattan Project's {{effort to}} produce <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> by liquid thermal {{diffusion}} during World War II. It {{was one of}} three technologies for uranium enrichment pursued by the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|For a while, the calutrons {{suffered}} {{from a series of}} debilitating breakdowns and equipment failures, exacerbated by a shortage of spare parts. Hopes that the Alpha II racetracks would be more reliable soon faded, as they were plagued by insulator failures. These problems were gradually overcome. The first shipments of <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory were made in March 1944, consisting of Alpha product enriched to 13 to 15 percent uranium-235. While of no use in a bomb, it was urgently required for experiments with <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium.</b> The last shipment of Alpha product was made on 11 May 1944. On 7 June 1944, Y-12 made its first delivery of weapons-grade Beta product, enriched to as high as 89% uranium-235.|$|E

5|$|The impracticability of a gun-type bomb using {{plutonium}} {{was agreed}} {{at a meeting}} in Los Alamos on July 17, 1944. All gun-type work in the Manhattan Project was directed at the Little Boy <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> gun design, and almost all of the research at the Los Alamos Laboratory was re-oriented around the problems of implosion for the Fat Man bomb.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{four more}} gaseous {{diffusion}} plants {{were added to}} the site, named K-27, K-29, K-31 and K-33. The K-25 site was renamed the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant in 1955. Production of <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> ended in 1964, and gaseous diffusion finally ceased on the site on 27 August 1985. The Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant was renamed the Oak Ridge K-25 Site in 1989, and the East Tennessee Technology Park in 1996. Demolition of all five gaseous diffusion plants was completed in February 2017.|$|E
5|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that {{spent nuclear fuel}} and high-level reprocessing and plutonium wastes require well-designed storage for periods ranging from tens of thousands to a million years, to minimize releases of the contained radioactivity into the environment. Safeguards are also required to ensure that neither plutonium nor highly <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> is diverted to weapon use. There is general agreement that placing spent nuclear fuel in repositories hundreds of meters below the surface would be safer than indefinite storage of spent fuel on the surface.|$|E

5|$|The Smithsonian Institution {{displayed}} a Little Boy (complete, except for <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium),</b> until 1986. The Department of Energy took the weapon {{from the museum}} to remove its inner components, so the bombs could not be stolen and detonated with fissile material. The government returned the emptied casing to the Smithsonian in 1993. Three other disarmed bombs are {{on display in the}} United States; another is at the Imperial War Museum in London.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{possible}} sources for natural promethium: rare decays of natural europium-151 (producing promethium-147), and uranium (various isotopes). Practical applications exist only for chemical compounds of promethium-147, {{which are used}} in luminous paint, atomic batteries and thickness measurement devices, even though promethium-145 is the most stable promethium isotope. Because natural promethium is exceedingly scarce, it is typically synthesized by bombarding uranium-235 (<b>enriched</b> <b>uranium)</b> with thermal neutrons to produce promethium-147 as a fission product.|$|E
5|$|A {{calutron}} is a {{mass spectrometer}} originally designed {{and used for}} separating the isotopes of uranium. It was developed by Ernest Lawrence during the Manhattan Project and was based on his earlier invention, the cyclotron. Its name was derived from California University Cyclotron, in tribute to Lawrence's institution, the University of California, where it was invented. Calutrons {{were used in the}} industrial-scale Y-12 uranium enrichment plant at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> produced was used in the Little Boy atomic bomb that was detonated over Hiroshima on 6 August 1945.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} much {{controversy}} surrounding Iran and its nuclear program {{in the past few}} years. The controversy centers on the Iranian enrichment of uranium. Iran officials have stated that they are <b>enriching</b> the <b>uranium</b> to fuel civilian reactors as permitted under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and other international agreements, but the processes that Iran has been developing to reprocess and <b>enrich</b> <b>uranium</b> are also critical components {{for the development of a}} nuclear weapon.|$|R
25|$|In August 2010, the IAEA said Iran {{has started}} using {{a second set}} of 164 {{centrifuges}} linked in a cascade, or string of machines, to <b>enrich</b> <b>uranium</b> to up to 20% at its Natanz pilot fuel enrichment plan.|$|R
50|$|The Port Hope Families Against Radiation Exposure group {{consists}} of 1570 concerned residents of Port Hope who are monitoring {{the activities of}} the nuclear industry, following a 16-month campaign against the plans of Cameco Corporation to <b>enrich</b> <b>uranium.</b>|$|R
5|$|Because {{uranium-235}} {{was known}} to be fissionable, it was the first material pursued in the approach to bomb development. As the first design developed (as well as the first deployed for combat), it is sometimes known as the Mark I. The vast majority of the work {{came in the form of}} the isotope enrichment of the uranium necessary for the weapon, since uranium-235 makes up only 1 part in 140 of natural uranium. Enrichment was performed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the electromagnetic separation plant, known as Y-12, became fully operational in March 1944. The first shipments of highly <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> were sent to the Los Alamos Laboratory in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon and the plutonium gun-type fission weapon, the uranium gun-type weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design. The concept was pursued so that {{in case of a}} failure to develop a plutonium bomb, it would still be possible to use the gun principle. The gun-type design henceforth had to work with <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted. The simplified weapon was short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay.|$|E
5|$|In early 1944 the Currans {{were part}} of a group of British {{scientists}} invited to go to the US to take part in the Manhattan Project – the Allied project to develop an atomic bomb. They joined the British Mission at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory in California, headed by Mark Oliphant, a distinguished Australian scientist that Joan knew from the Cavendish Laboratory. Oliphant also acted as de facto deputy to Ernest Lawrence, the director of the Radiation Laboratory. The mission of the laboratory was to develop the electromagnetic isotope separation process to create <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> for use in atomic bombs.|$|E

25|$|Iran also {{believes}} {{it has a}} legal right to <b>enrich</b> <b>uranium</b> for peaceful purposes under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), a right which in 2005 the U.S. and the EU-3 began to assert had been forfeited by a clandestine nuclear program that came to light in 2002.|$|R
5|$|Pilot {{plants were}} {{built at the}} Anacostia Naval Air Station and the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and a {{production}} facility at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This was the only production-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant ever built. It could not enrich uranium sufficiently for use in an atomic bomb, but it could provide slightly enriched feed for the Y-12 calutrons and the K-25 gaseous diffusion plants. It was estimated that the S-50 plant had sped up production of <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> used in the Little Boy bomb employed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by a week.|$|E
5|$|Starting May 1946, the S-50 plant {{buildings}} were utilised, {{not as a}} production facility, but by the United States Army Air Forces' Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft (NEPA) project. Fairchild Aircraft {{conducted a series of}} experiments there involving beryllium. Workers also fabricated blocks of <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> and graphite. NEPA operated until May 1951, when it was superseded by the joint Atomic Energy Commission-United States Air Force Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion project. The S-50 plant was disassembled in the late 1940s. Equipment was taken to the K-25 powerhouse area, where it was stored before being salvaged or buried.|$|E
5|$|The S-1 Section of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, as the Advisory Committee on Uranium was now known, met on 18 December 1941, {{with the}} U.S. now engaged in World War II, making its work urgent. Most {{of the effort}} {{sponsored}} by the Committee had been directed at producing <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium,</b> but Committee member Arthur Compton determined that a feasible alternative was plutonium, which could be mass-produced in nuclear reactors {{by the end of}} 1944. He decided to concentrate the plutonium work at the University of Chicago. Fermi reluctantly moved, and his team became part of the new Metallurgical Laboratory there.|$|E
