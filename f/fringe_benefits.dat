5|$|The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System {{was built}} entirely with unionized labor. Because {{construction}} was slumping in the United States at large, the pipeline drew workers {{from across the}} country. These workers had to follow a strict hiring process based on union seniority and the labor that was needed. Priority was given to hiring Alaska residents and Alaska Natives, and no strikes were permitted by a labor agreement between Alyeska and the unions. In exchange for abiding by these restrictions, workers were paid extremely well and received <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits.</b> According to the labor contract, every worker was guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week, even if weather made work impossible. In addition, subcontractors had cost-plus contracts with Alyeska for staffing, {{so there was no}} incentive to keep staffing levels low. These factors often led to more people being assigned to a job than there was work to do in an attempt to make up time lost to weather delays. At the peak of construction in fall 1975, more than 28,000 people were working on the pipeline. Fourteen to 19 percent of the workers were minorities, and 5 to 10 percent were women. Because of the high turnover on the project, more than 70,000 people worked on at least a part of the pipeline.|$|E

25|$|Organizational {{reward systems}} have a {{significant}} impact on employees' level of motivation. Rewards can be either tangible or intangible. Various forms of pay, such as salary, commissions, bonuses, employee ownership programs and various types of profit or gain sharing programs, are all important tangible rewards. While <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> have a positive impact on attraction and retention, their direct impact on motivation and performance is not well-defined.|$|E

5000|$|The {{methods of}} valuing the <b>fringe</b> <b>benefit</b> {{for a car}} or other motor vehicle allow a {{contribution}} from the employee toward the running costs to offset the <b>fringe</b> <b>benefit.</b> [...] Since the employee is now directly paying {{for some of the}} costs, this reduces the income tax and GST benefits, but because FBT, equivalent to the highest marginal tax rate, is eliminated, the net cost to the employee of the arrangement is less. The employee contribution can take either the form of direct payment for expenses or can be paid to the employer. Since the maximum benefit is obtained by making a contribution of exactly the amount of the <b>fringe</b> <b>benefit</b> (eliminating all FBT), usually the latter is used. In this case, the employer must remit GST on the employee contribution to the ATO. Thus the reduction in employee salary becomes equal to the total running costs paid by the employer, less GST on those costs, less the employee contribution, plus GST on the employee contribution. In addition, the employee contribution is paid to the employer from the salary on which income tax has already been paid.|$|R
50|$|One {{consequence}} of the wage stabilization under the Act was that employers, unable to provide higher salaries to attract or retain employees, began to offer insurance plans, including health care packages, as a <b>fringe</b> <b>benefit,</b> thereby beginning the practice of employer-sponsored health insurance.|$|R
25|$|In February 1994, {{an audit}} {{committee}} headed by future political candidate Bruce Lunsford revealed TARC had been mismanaging funds {{and was on}} pace to deplete its once-large trust fund due to skyrocketting expenses such as door-to-door services for the disabled as well as rates of spending on personal services and <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> for administrators that was much higher than in transit companies for similar sized cities. In the fallout of the audit, TARC's executive director resigned and fares were nearly doubled before year's end.|$|E
25|$|Pushes for {{a charity}} {{commission}} in Australia have stemmed from claims that religious organisations like Hillsong pay their staff in <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits.</b> Criticisms have been levelled at Hillsong {{in regard to}} its finances, especially its use of government grants when it reportedly made $40 million in 2004 and $50 million in 2010. It was alleged that Hillsong had paid staff members with money given as a government grant for {{the assistance of the}} Riverstone Aboriginal community. This appears to have been refuted by letters of apology, published on the Hillsong website, from both the Riverstone Aboriginal Community and from the Minister of Justice and Customs.|$|E
25|$|The Lackawanna Steel plant stopped {{most of its}} {{operations}} on October 15, 1982. The company laid off workers in waves before the final closure, and transferred many others. On the day the plant stopped most of {{its operations}}, more than 6,000 workers lost their jobs (most of them high-paying). The city of Lackawanna's 22,700 people faced extremely large tax increases just to maintain basic services, {{as the amount of}} taxes paid by Bethlehem Steel fell from 66 percent of the city's revenue to just 8 percent. In addition, the city owed the company more than $5 million in tax overcharges. The United Steelworkers later successfully sued Bethlehem Steel for prematurely terminating the <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> of the laid-off steelworkers.|$|E

25|$|Eisenhower set {{in motion}} the Taft-Hartley {{machinery}} on October 9, and appointed a Board of Inquiry. However, Eisenhower limited the Board to clarifying the issues rather than recommending a settlement. Realizing that the strike could linger despite the provisions of Taft-Hartley, management offered a three-year contract with small improvements in pay and <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> and binding arbitration over Section 2(b). McDonald rejected the offer. He proposed a contract similar to his proposal of early July, but reduced the union's wage and benefit demand and limited the contract to two rather than three years. Working off a plan devised by Goldberg, McDonald also proposed a nine-member committee consisting of three members from labor, management, and the public to study and resolve work-rule issues. Management rejected the new proposal.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} found that Americans have six {{lifestyle}} choices as they age: continuing to work full-time, continuing to work part-time, retiring from work and becoming engaged in a variety of leisure activities, retiring from work and becoming involved in a variety of recreational and leisure activities, retiring from work and later returning to work part-time, and retiring from work and later returning to work full-time. An important note to make from these lifestyle definitions are that four of the six involve working. America is facing an important demographic change in that the Baby Boomer generation is now reaching retirement age. This poses two challenges: whether there will be a sufficient number of skilled workers in the work force, and whether the current pension programs will be sufficient to support the growing number of retired people. The reasons that some people choose to never retire, or to return to work after retiring include not only the difficulty of planning for retirement but also wages and <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits,</b> expenditure of physical and mental energy, production of goods and services, social interaction, and social status may interact to influence an individual’s work force participation decision.|$|E
25|$|It is {{impossible}} to discuss motivation and job attributes in I–O psychology without crediting Frederick Herzberg's Motivator–Hygiene Theory (also referred to as Herzberg's Two-factor theory). Published in 1968, Herzberg's Motivator–Hygiene Theory holds that the content of a person's job is {{the primary source of}} motivation. In other words, he argued against the commonly held belief that money and other compensation is the most effective form of motivation to an employee. Instead, Herzberg posed that high levels of what he dubbed hygiene factors (pay, job security, status, working conditions, <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits,</b> job policies, and relations with co-workers) could only reduce employee dissatisfaction (not create satisfaction). Motivation factors (level of challenge, the work itself, responsibility, recognition, advancement, intrinsic interest, autonomy, and opportunities for creativity) however, could stimulate satisfaction within the employee, provided that minimum levels of the hygiene factors were reached. For an organization {{to take full advantage of}} Herzberg's theory, they must design jobs in such a way that motivators are built in, and thus are intrinsically rewarding. While the Motivation–Hygiene Theory was the first to focus on job content, it has not been strongly supported through empirical studies.|$|E
