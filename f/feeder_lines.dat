5|$|The Premetro was {{originally}} intended to include a number of <b>feeder</b> <b>lines</b> to the Underground network, including a second one to Line E and ones on lines C and D. The Premetro project was largely abandoned since it occurred in Argentina's transition to democracy from the military junta and then the privatisation of the railways, which was a difficult time economically for the country, and only Line E2 was built. New Premetro <b>feeder</b> <b>lines</b> have been proposed in recent years, however, {{the role of the}} network has given way to the new Metrobus network which covers many of the same routes originally intended for the Premetro.|$|E
5|$|Hays {{made the}} {{construction}} of the mainline his priority, failing to develop <b>feeder</b> <b>lines.</b> CNoR and CPR joined forces to gain control of the prairie traffic. The competition among the three railroads led to Canada's ending up with three transcontinental railways instead of one. This was to result in the GTP's being starved of traffic; even though it was arguably the best of the three, it ultimately failed to attract enough freight to make it profitable.|$|E
50|$|Siu Sai Wan {{residents}} {{using this}} <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> {{will need to}} interchange at Heng Fa Chuen Station to the Island Line. This is similar to other road-based transport systems. While reclamation might not be required, private land and land for recreational purposes {{will need to be}} used for the construction of the <b>feeder</b> <b>line.</b> As the <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> is built {{in the form of a}} viaduct, it will create permanent visual and noise impacts to nearby buildings.|$|R

30|$|A {{current loop}} is added and many {{benefits}} are gained. Firstly, it can avoid unwanted inflow and outflow between the SC and the <b>feeder</b> <b>line.</b> Secondly, it can decide the voltage dynamic value and the static value.

5|$|In 1979, SBA became Subterráneos de Buenos Aires Sociedad del Estado (SBASE) under Buenos Aires mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore of the National Reorganisation Process {{military}} junta. After a {{long period}} of stagnation, the Underground began to be expanded again with Lines B and E within the scope of these plans, though only the extension of Line E was commenced and completed before the transition to democracy where expansion was once again stalled. During this time, four Premetro <b>feeder</b> <b>lines</b> were planned leading out from the western termini of Lines D and E as well as one in Puerto Madero, however only Line E2 was completed in 1987 and these plans were scrapped in 1994 when operation of the Underground changed hands.|$|E
5|$|Sewage outfalls {{into the}} lake are {{proposed}} to be completely stopped by the interception and diversion of <b>feeder</b> <b>lines.</b> Lining the main feeders {{into the lake}} and setting up water treatment plants to continuously treat and recirculate the lake water are also envisioned. Conservation measures proposed for adoption to clean the lake are by way of desilting and deweeding, water treatment at inlet of feeders into the lake, construction of check dams, conservation of ghats, afforestation of denuded hills in the catchment, soil moisture conservation measures, stabilization of sand dunes by planting vegetation of suitable species of plants and restriction of cultivation {{in the bed of}} feeder channels. In addition, the institutional measures considered for effecting improvement of the lake are mass awareness programmes with the population's participation as well as the control of fish proliferation {{to reduce the risk of}} death of fishes during periods of inadequate water depth in the lake.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} current {{challenges}} to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states {{in the middle of}} the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances. However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so. Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow <b>feeder</b> <b>lines</b> to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.|$|E
50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, a <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> {{is a type}} {{of transmission}} line. In radio engineering, a feeder connects radio equipment to an antenna, usually open wire (air-insulated wire line) or twin-lead from a shortwave transmitter. In power engineering, a <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> is part of an electric distribution network, usually a radial circuit of intermediate voltage.|$|R

In 1907 the NP {{purchased}} the A&CR to be a <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> {{for the new}} Spokane Portland and Seattle Railway. To help the new <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> handle increasing freight traffic, an NP Switcher was sold to the A&CR on August 7, 1907. The SP&S took over the A&CR and on February 24, 1911, obtained all A&CR locomotives. The former A&CR switch locomotive number 1 became SP&S number 6.|$|R

40|$|Railway {{traction}} {{systems are}} highly susceptible to severe harmonic distortion, poor voltage regulation and line resonances. Electric locomotives, which are concentrated high power loads, move continuously along the supply line, rendering the topography {{of the supply}} system, a time-variable. Under those conditions, the resonant impedances vary as the traction vehicle moves along the track. Parallel resonances with <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> inductance and capacitance between <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> and earth, cause harmonic magnification. This paper will examine the use of small retrofit converters to improve the performance of multiphase PWM rectifiers as found in locomotive applications...|$|R

25|$|In {{the last}} year {{before the end of}} the war, the Confederate {{railroad}} system stood permanently on the verge of collapse. There was no new equipment and raids on both sides systematically destroyed key bridges, as well as locomotives and freight cars. Spare parts were cannibalized; <b>feeder</b> <b>lines</b> were torn up to get replacement rails for trunk lines, and rolling stock wore out through heavy use.|$|E
25|$|The Metro did not {{immediately}} win the approval from inhabitants of eastern Helsinki, whose direct bus links to the city centre had now been turned into <b>feeder</b> <b>lines</b> for the Metro.

Subsequently the timetables of the feeder services were adjusted and opposition to the Metro mostly died down.|$|E
5000|$|Bohunice NPP {{comprises}} two plants: V1 and V2. Both plants contain two reactor units. The {{plant was}} connected to the national power network in stages in the period between 1978 and 1985. The four power reactors are pressurized water reactors of the Soviet VVER-440 design. [...] Annual electricity generation averages about 12,000 GWh. Upon development of a district heating supply network in the town of Trnava near Bohunice NPP, V2 switched to co-generation. Part of this system is a heat <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> commissioned in 1987. In 1997 a heat <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> to Leopoldov and Hlohovec was begun, branching off from the Trnava line.|$|R
50|$|On February 1, 1872, Hughitt {{was named}} General Superintendent of the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad (CNW). He also closely worked with James Henry Howe, {{the manager of}} the line, who was {{generally}} unfamiliar with railroads. When Howe resigned, and following a short term by Henry H. Porter, Hughitt was named General Manager of the line in 1876. Four years later, the board of directors elected him Second Vice President. In 1882, he was named president of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway, a <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> to the CNW. Two years later he accepted the presidency of the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad, another <b>feeder</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|Originally Seligman {{was called}} “Prescott Junction” {{because it was}} the {{railroad}} stop on the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad mainline junction with the Prescott and Arizona Central Railway Company <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> running to Prescott, in the Arizona Territory. The Santa Fe had reached it in 1882. In 1886 it was renamed Seligman, after Jesse Seligman, {{one of the founders of}} J.W. Seligman Co. of New York, who helped finance the railroad lines in the area. The original <b>feeder</b> <b>line</b> to Prescott was replaced in 1891 by the Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railway with the Santa Fe mainline junction at Ash Fork instead.|$|R
