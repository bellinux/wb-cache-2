50|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which excess money might be translated into inflation are examined below. Individuals can also spend their excess money balances directly on goods and services. This has {{a direct impact on}} inflation by raising aggregate demand. Also, the increase in the demand for labour resulting from higher demands for goods and services will cause a rise in money wages and unit labour costs. The more inelastic the aggregate supply in the economy, the greater the impact on inflation. The increase in demand for goods and services may cause a rise in imports. Although this leakage from the domestic economy reduces the money supply, it also increases the supply of money on the foreign exchange market thus applying downward pressure on the exchange rate.

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of the paper has been to assess {{the relationship between the}} real exchange rate and inflation in Nigeria. Using data covering the period between 1970 and 2010, the cointegration test result shows a long run relationship between inflation and the real exchange rate. The satisfactory speed of adjustment indicated by the error correction model further supports this long run relationship. The result showed that both domestic and <b>imported</b> <b>inflation</b> appreciated the real exchange rate. The ARCH result indicates the persistence of volatility between the rate of inflation and the real exchange rate. An indication that the real exchange rate in Nigeria has been susceptible to fluctuations in the rate of inflation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the real {{purchasing}} power of OPEC Member Countries' oil revenues, which are subject to "the value of the US dollar vis-à-vis other major currencies" and "world imported inflation". The exponential weighting average formula with a broad basket of currencies is suggested. The basket of currencies is labelled as a broad currency basket and includes the major trading partners of OPEC Member Countries. The weights are normalized OPEC import shares of the countries of the basket and are updated and adjusted every year to incorporate a gradual change in the trade pattern. In other words, the dynamic trade pattern approach is incorporated in the calculations. The nominal dollar oil revenues of OPEC Member Countries are about $ 5, 099 billion during 1970 to 2004, of which $ 3, 725 bn (73 per cent) have been lost due to <b>imported</b> <b>inflation</b> and the dollar's depreciation. <b>Imported</b> <b>inflation</b> and dollar depreciation have had a respective 78. 6 per cent and 21. 4 per cent contribution to the losses of the purchasing power of OPEC Member Countries. The <b>imported</b> <b>inflation</b> rate approaches a stable low level, but OPEC still has a lot of concerns on dollar swings. The euro offers opportunities for many oil-exporting nations that have extensive trade relations with Euro-zone countries. Payments for oil exports can be invoked in euros at the prevailing dollar-euro rate on the day of a given contract, or any other trigger formula. This would immunize a major portion of OPEC oil revenues from dollar depreciation. Copyright 2005 Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. ...|$|E

40|$|In the {{backdrop}} of recent developments in global commodity prices, this study provides analytical and empirical perspectives on <b>imported</b> <b>inflation</b> in the Indian context. Sources and commodity-wise trends in <b>imported</b> <b>inflation</b> are analysed during the last four decades. Empirical analysis suggests that at the global level, export of inflation from oil exporting countries is significantly {{higher than that of}} industrial and non-oil developing countries including Asia. At the same time, despite low domestic inflation, export of inflation from industrial countries is significantly higher than that of non-oil developing countries. Inflation in India is positively influenced by import price, capital flows and exchange rate. Based on a non-parametric approach, import price inflation on an average accounts for about 1 to 2 percentage points increase in domestic inflation. Within the framework of the vector error correction and cointegration model, about 5 percentage points increase in import prices contribute to 1 to 1. 5 percentage points increase in domestic prices. In terms of variance decomposition analysis, capital flows have a greater impact on domestic inflation, deriving from the former’s association with exchange rate and import prices...|$|E

The model is estimated using Bayesian techniques on data of Czech economy. Estimated values of structural parameters are economically interpreted. Assessing of model fit to data {{is carried out}} along several dimensions. Firstly, the fitted series are compared with observed series. Secondly, the volatility and the autocorrelations implied by the model are compared with the statistics calculated from the data. And thirdly, estimated unobserved shocks give picture of important events in the Czech economy. The results of the analysis show that model has problem in replicating <b>import</b> <b>inflation</b> and hours worked. Besides visual assessment, calculated standard deviations of model variables and observed variables indicate that volatility of wage inflation is higher in the model and volatility of <b>import</b> <b>inflation</b> is lower in the model than in the data. The auto correlations of nominal interest rate, CPI inflation and output growth are not matched well by the model. Estimates of unobserved shocks show that period of recession in 1997 had many sources. High nominal interest rates can be ascribed to monetary policy and risk premium shocks, decline in output growth is consequence of negative productivity shock. High inflation in late 90 's is partly explained as rise in markups of domestic producers. Despite few failures, overall fit of the model to the data {{can be considered as}} satisfactory.

This evidence suggests that the impact of Chinese exports on global import prices has been, while non- negligible, fairly modest. We identify a statistically significant effect of US imports from China on US import prices, but given the size of this effect and the relatively low share of imports in US GDP, the ultimate impact on US consumer prices has likely been quite small. Moreover, imports from China had little apparent effect on US producer prices. Finally, using a multi-country database of trade transactions, we estimate that, since 1993, Chinese exports lowered annual <b>import</b> <b>inflation</b> in a large set of economies by 0. 25 percentage point or less on average.
