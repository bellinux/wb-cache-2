40|$|In {{order to}} perform Quantum Cryptography {{procedures}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> often <b>essencial</b> to ensure <b>that</b> the {{parties of the}} communication are authentic. Such task is accomplished by quantum authentication protocols which are distributed algorithms based on the intrinsic properties of Quantum Mechanics. The choice of an authentication protocol must consider that quantum states are very delicate and that the channel is subject to eavesdropping. However, even in face of the various existing definitions of quantum authentication protocols in the literature, {{little is known about}} them in this perspective, and this lack of knowledge may unfavor comparisons and wise choices. In the attempt to overcome this limitation, in the present work we aim at showing an approach to evaluate quantum authentication protocols based on the determination of their quantum communication complexity. Based on our investigation, no similar methods to analyze quantum authentication protocols were found in the literature. Pursuing this further, our approach has advantages that need to <b>be</b> highlighted: <b>it</b> characterizes a systematic procedure to evaluate quantum authentication protocols; its evaluation is intuitive, based only on the protocol execution; the resulting measure is a concise notation of what resources a quantum authentication protocol demands and how many communications <b>are</b> performed; <b>it</b> allows comparisons between protocols; it makes possible to analyze the communication effort when an eavesdropping occurs; and, lastly, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> likely to be applied in almost any quantum authentication protocol. To illustrate the proposed approach, we also bring results about its application in ten existing quantum authentication protocols (data origin authentication and identity authentication). Such evaluations increase the knowledge about the existing protocols, presenting its advantages, limitations and contrasts. Comment: 7 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
40|$|Tese de mestrado, Bioética, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, 2014 A prática da Medicina é feita de opções, a maior parte de natureza clínica, algumas envolvendo problemas éticos prementes, {{principal}}mente nos dois momentos cruciais da Vida do Homem: o seu nascimento e a sua morte. A Ética, como foi definida por Théo Klein, representa um delicadíssimo equilíbrio “que nos convida à inquietude do questionamento e à procura da boa resposta”. A Cirurgia, mais do que qualquer outra especialidade, requer um comportamento ético inquestionável. É um facto que propicia um relacionamento privilegiado entre médico e doente, sendo também uma especialidade muito pragmática, de decisões difíceis e muito rápidas, especialmente em contexto de Urgência. A cirurgia (e a anestesia) representam um stress enorme do ponto de vista físico e uma intrusão dolorosa no íntimo do doente. Por isso, as decisões de operar ou não, em determinadas circunstâncias têm que ser muito bem ponderadas e analisadas senão corre-se o risco de nos obstinarmos em terapêuticas fúteis, que não só não trarão benefícios ao doente mas serão fonte de dor, desconforto e sofrimento. O objectivo desta dissertação é duplo: 1. Avaliar o conhecimento de um grupo de cirurgiões sobre os problemas éticos levantados pelas decisões em fim de vida 2. Avaliar as atitudes, do ponto de vista ético e deontológico, desse mesmo grupo de cirurgiões, face ao doente em fim de vida. Foi utilizada metodologia de investigação qualitativa, tendo sido efectuado um estudo qualitativo exploratório descritivo baseado em entrevistas não estruturadas, com uma única pergunta à qual os entrevistados, oito médicos, responderam livremente. Apesar das dimensões da amostra não permitirem a extrapolação dos resultados a populações maiores, os objectivos propostos foram plenamente cumpridos. A análise das entrevistas revelou diferenças subtis entre os vários grupos, relacionadas com a diferenciação profissional e a especialidade dos entrevistados. Estas diferenças são conceptuais porque na prática as atitudes são correctas e demonstram grande compreensão e compaixão por estes doentes, nomeadamente: - É indispensável que todas as decisões sejam partilhadas (por todos os envolvidos), mas individualizadas (para cada doente), tendo como principal finalidade o conforto e o alívio da sintomatologia com especial destaque para a dor. - Negar a obstinação terapêutica e ter a coragem de não-iniciar/suspender terapêuticas que não tenham qualquer utilidade, de modo a obter uma morte digna e livre de dor, assegurando o máximo respeito e dignidade durante todo o processo do morrer. Medical {{practice is}} made of choices, most of them, clinical in its nature, some of them concerning challenging ethical problems, mainly in the two most crucial moments of Man’s Life: his birth and his death. Ethics, as defined by Théo Klein represents a very delicate balance “which invites you to the restlessness of inquiry {{and the quest for}} the best solution”. Surgery, more than any other medical speciality demands an unquestionable ethical behavior. It creates a very special bond between doctor and patient, being also a very pragmatic speciality, as it needs very difficult and very fast decisions, specially in the Emergency Room. Surgical (and anesthetic) procedures represent an huge physical stress and a painful intrusion into the patient´s intimacy. So, decisions to operate, or not, in very specific circunstances must be very well weighted and analysed, or else we take the risk of therapeutic obstinacy, which is not beneficial for the patient and will be a source of pain, discomfort and suffering. The dissertation´s purpose is a double one: 1. To evaluate a group of surgeons knowledge on the ethical problems of end-of-life decisions. 2. To evaluate, that same group of surgeons attitudes, concerning the terminal patient, from an ethical and deontological point of view. Qualitative research methodology was used, in elaborating a qualitative, exploratory, descriptive study based on non-structured interviews given by eight doctors, comprising a single question, freely answered by the participants. In spite of the small dimension of the sample, not allowing extrapolation of results to a wider population, the goals were fully attained. The interview`s analysis revealed subtle differences between the groups that are related with professional grade and the interviewd speciality. These are conceptual differences because the attitudes are correct and reveal a great understanding and compassion to these patients, namely: - <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>essencial</b> to share all decisions (with all envolved persons), but individualizing them (to each patient), being the main goal the confort and symptomatic relief, specially regarding pain. - To deny therapeutical obstinacy and have the courage to withhold/withdraw futile therapeuthics, to obtain a dignified, free of pain death, assuring the greatest respect and dignity, throughout all the dying process.

In this work we use C 57 Bl/ 6 mice congenitally deficient in the IFN-g gene (IFN-g KO) to address this issue. We found that IFN-g KO mice were as resistant as their wild-type (WT) counterparts at least during the first two months of infection. Afterwards, whereas WT mice maintained lesion growth under control, IFN-g KO mice developed devastating lesions. At day 97 of infection, their lesions were 9 -fold larger than WT controls, concomitant with an increased parasite burden. At this stage, lesion-draining cells from IFN-g KO mice had impaired capacity to produce interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) and tumour necrosis factor-a in response to parasite antigens whereas IL- 4 was slightly increased in comparison to infected WT mice. Together, these results show that IFN-g is not critical for the initial control of L. amazonensis infection in C 57 Bl/ 6 mice, but <b>is</b> <b>essencial</b> for the developmente of a protective Th 1 type immune response in the later stages...|$|R

Objective: This study {{was based on the}} retrospective and quantitative analysis of the post-analytical phase indicators from the internal quality monitoring (IQM) program for cytopathology laboratories, such as: positivity rate, atypical squamous cell (ASC) /satisfactory exams ratio, ASC/abnormal test results ratio, ASC/squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) ratio, percentage of tests compatible with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), and total of false negative. Materials and methods: The information was extracted from the computerized system of the Section for Integrated Technology in Cytopathology (Se&# 231;&# 227;o Integrada de Tecnologia em Citopatologia [SITEC]), a reference institution for cancer cytopathology, from July 2013 to June 2014. From a total of 156, 888 Pap smears, 157, 454 were considered satisfactory for indicator analysis and 566 were excluded because they were considered unsatisfactory and/or rejected for analysis. The data was organized in tables using Microsoft Excel 2010 software, and categorized as indicators. Results: The averages for the indicators were: 7. 2 % for positivity rate, 56. 9 for ASC/abnormal test ratio, 4. 1 for ASC/satisfactory tests ratio, 1. 4 for ASC/SIL ratio, 0. 6 % percentage for tests compatible with HSIL, and 2. 1 % for false-negative rate.

40|$|Background and Goal of Study: The current {{definition}} of delirium comprises acute change or fluctuation in mental status and inattention, accompanied by either altered level of consciousness or disorganized thinking. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> a frequent condition in the ICU and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> associated with longer hospital stay, increase in mortality at 6 months and long-term cognitive impairment, but remains under diagnosed. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) has been validated and implemented in many ICUs {{and its use}} is recommended by the Society of Critical Care Medicine. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> our purpose to evaluate the individual perspective and the objective knowledge of our staf f about delirium before {{the implementation of the}} CAM-ICU. Materials and Methods: Anonymous survey to our ICU clinical staf f which contained subjective and ‘true or false’ questions. Data was analised with the sof tware SPSS version 17. 0. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare autoperception of knowledge about delirium and the content of answers regarding its definiton. Results: Forty two questionnaires were returned (participation rate of 73 %), 11 from physicians and 31 from nurses. Overall, 61, 9 % of inquiries think they can give a definition for delirium in the ICU and 50 % claim to be able to evaluate delirium. 28, 6 % of the respondents - 63, 6 % of the physicians and 16, 1 % of the nurses - know the CAM-ICU. From these only a quarter has received education on this method, 75 % think it’s easy to apply and 66 % don’t see its use as an increase in the daily workload. We found a high rate of wrong and ‘I don’t know’ answers to questions about operationalization, diagnosis and outcome. The subjects’ auto-perception on their knowledge about delirium [Likert scale] was compared to their ability to answer questions related to its definiton - ‘attention deficit <b>is</b> <b>essencial</b> for diagnosis’ [true], Wilcoxon test Z=- 4, 699 (p< 0, 001); ‘disorganized thinking is essential for diagnosis’ [false], Wilcoxon test Z=- 4, 437 (p< 0, 001). Conclusions: The respondents’ auto perception of knowledge about delirium doesn’t translate in the ability of giving an appropriate definition and making an adequate evaluation. Most of the inquiries don’t know the CAM-ICU, but those who do believe it’s easy to apply and its use won’t increase the workload.

The Rule of Law is part of the 2 ̆ 2 software 2 ̆ 2 of governmental regulation that is needed to operate the 2 ̆ 2 hardware 2 ̆ 2 of free markets. Its promotion can make a major contribution to economic growth, and an infrastructure that creates and promites legal rights is an essential platform for economic development. The cumulative costs of doing without the Rule of Law in a modern economy are enormous. Establishing a firmly rooted system of the Rule of Law is unfinished business in the countries participating in the Central American Free Trade Agreement (2 ̆ 2 CAFTA 2 ̆ 2). Building an effective Rule of Law <b>is</b> <b>essencial</b> to the promotion of a free market economic system that fosters transparency in business transactions and operations. The Rule of Law in the commercial sector promotes economic stability and growth, encourages investors to make investments, creates jobs, increases the standard of living, and promotes prosperity. The Rule of Law requirements for a market economy differ rather substantially from the Rule of Law requirements for other types of social needs. The purpose of this comment is to outline those Rule of Law features that are essential to the proper functioning of a free market economy and {{to call attention to the}} unique characteristics of these legal features.

Porém, trato de aprendizagem de um grupo específico: alunos com Transtornos Globais de Desenvolvimento (autistas e psicóticos). Com base nisso, este estudo teve por objetivo identificar as Representações Sociais de professores de uma escola de Santa Maria-RS acerca da aprendizagem desses alunos. O referencial teórico utilizado foi a teoria psicanalítica e a teoria das Representações Sociais. Através da articulação entre estágio do espelho e representações sociais estabeleceu-se o diálogo entre as teorias. Assim, o mapeamento das representações sociais estabeleceu o campo no qual o sujeito da aprendizagem é antecipado pelo professor. Em uma abordagem qualitativa, foram utilizados como instrumentos de coleta de dados entrevistas, examinadas através da análise de conteúdo, e observações participantes na escola. A análise dos dados mostrou que a socialização é vista pela maior parte dos professores como o objetivo {{principal}} da escolarização desses alunos. Além disso, revelou a influência das representações sociais acerca da capacidade de aprender desses sujeitos no processo de ensino-aprendizagem. Sendo assim, poder ressignificar as representações sociais que apontam para a direção da incapacidade de aprender desses alunos e a própria representação de socialização é essencial para seu processo de escolarização.

Otherwise, I treat about the learning of a specific group: students with Pervasive Developmental Disorders (authists and psychotics). Based on that, this study has as objective to identify the Social Representations of teachers of a school from Santa Maria/RS, about the learning of those students. The theoretical referents used here, were the psychanalist theory and the social representations theory. Throught the analisys of the mirror phase and social representation, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> stablished a relation between both theories.

Programa de Pós-Graduação em EcologiaAtualmente são registradas na costa brasileira 18 espécies de escleractínios zooxantelados, 06 escleractínios azooxantelados de água rasa, e 05 hidrocorais. Santa Catarina é o estado mais ao sul no Brasil com ocorrência de costões rochosos, que proveem hábitat para a fauna séssil, no entanto, a fauna dos escleractínios de água rasa (50 m) scleractinian fauna remains poorly studied. To better {{understand}} shallow-water corals in souther Brazil, I conducted a literature review, consulted museum collections, and sampled at Reserva Biológica Marinha do Arvoredo (REBIO Marinha do Arvoredo) and adjacent island to Florianópolis. The results revealed {{the occurrence of}} five species of the order Scleractinia (Astrangia rathbuni, Phyllangia americana, Madracis decactis, Paracyathus pulchellus and Tubastraea coccinea), including the new record of the species P. pulchellus at shallow waters in Brazil, and the occurrence of the invasive coral T. coccinea at Arvoredo Island. Madracis decatis is the only zooxanthellate species confirmed to occur south {{of the state of}} São Paulo, forming at Galé Island (SC) the only free-living coral formatiom known in the Tropical South Atlantic. This study presents data on the spatial and temporal structure of this free-living coral bed, which occupies an area of about 3. 400 m 2 between 05 and 15 meters depth in the western portion of Galé Island. A distribution pattern is observed according to size, with smaller colonies in the shallower regions (07 m) and the larger colonies in the deeper regions (09 to 10 m) of the bed. This pattern could indicate that free-living colonies originated from fragmentation of encrusted colonies, and keep growing while rolling upon the substrate. Throughout the year there was a decrease in the density of colonies, probably resulting from burial and transport out of the sampled area. The actions of currents and bioturbators are the main factors responsible for the distribution and movement of colonies. This study reveals the presence of a unique, vulnerable and highly dynamic environment at the souther limit of reef species distribution in the Atlantic Ocean, and warns about the lack of data on the benthic fauna in southern Brazil. Specific inventories and extensive monitoring projects <b>are</b> <b>essencial</b> for understanding the responses of the southernmost reef coral environment in the Atlantic Oceanin a scenario of climate change and support future ecological studies...|$|R

For the Manufacturers that seek to manage its alliances and recognize the importance of partners interdependence, and the eventual need to initiate and or terminate certain alliances, comprehend the implications of reseller interaction with its agents <b>is</b> <b>essencial</b> for the portfolio management. After having investigated the dealership network of an Information Technology (IT) Company, the author of this dissertation formulates hypotheses and tests the impact of dealers network centrality over the number of new customers in the subsequent period. The empirical results evidence that the social relations created by previous business of resellers with the sales elite were correlated with joint business development in new customers in the following year, and that the strong commitment signalized by the reseller also gave positive contribution to the number of new common customers. This work contributes to interorganizational network researches, and offer a contruct that could be integrated on analisys models of alliance performance management, in the fields of sales & marketing, competitive strategy and corporate strategyEstabelecer uma aliança com um fabricante relevante não é suficiente para o desempenho de negócios conjuntos, conhecer e ter relacionamento com os principais agentes decisores de iniciativas conjuntas pode ter impacto positivo. Para os fabricantes que buscam a gestão de alianças e reconhecem a importância das interdependências entre os parceiros e a eventual necessidade de iniciar e ou terminar determinadas alianças, compreender as implicações das interações de seus aliados com seus agentes é essencial para a gestão do portfólio. Após ter investigado uma rede de revendedores de uma empresa do setor de tecnologia da informação (TI), o autor desta dissertação formula hipóteses e testa o impacto da centralidade de rede de revendedores na obtenção de novos clientes no período subsequente. Os resultados empíricos sugerem que as relações sociais, geradas a partir de negócios passados, das revendas com a elite de vendas do fabricante, estavam correlacionadas com negócios conjuntos em novos clientes no ano seguinte, e que a sinalização de forte comprometimento da revenda contribuiu também positivamente para o numero de novos clientes comuns.

40|$|Compal was a {{well-known}} Portuguese {{company in the}} industry of soft drinks. It launched Compal Essencial in 2006, which introduced consumers to a new category of fruit portions. <b>Essencial</b> <b>was</b> equivalent to a fruit portion and aimed to improve people’s fruit consumption habits by providing a quality and convenient product. This dissertation {{provides an overview of}} how Compal Essencial’s development process led to its success, translated in high sales levels, penetration rates and market share. Nevertheless, over the years new competitors emerged and the success of Compal Essencial seemed to vanish. In 2012 consumers appeared to understand the product concept and most of its important features, but this did not translate into high levels of consumption, as it did during the initial years of Essencial in the market. To give a broader overview of the product management, this work also contemplates a brief analysis of Compal Essencial’s internationalization strategy. Compal <b>Essencial</b> <b>was</b> exported to foreign partners with the ultimate goal of achieving numerical distribution and volume generation. Partnerships gave most control to the host country entity, which was responsible for most of the marketing decisions of placement, pricing and promotion. Compal’s contribution was mostly in providing the product along with general guidelines of communication content. The result was an expansion over nine new markets, though in some of them Essencial pulled out because the partnerships broke down. This dissertation provides material that allows an analysis over the factors that contributed to Compal Essencial’s brand extension success, as an example of innovation in the soft drinks industry. Furthermore, Compal Essencial’s case study allows an overview on how the process of strategic decision making and product management take place in the real world...|$|R

This study objectives assess the effect of residual organic fertilization on the income of mass drought and absorption of nutrient by sorghum grown in Entisol which for six years has received application of caprine manure or green fertilization with crotalaria and cultivated with potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). In the cultivation of potato annually the treatments consisted of planting and incorporation of the Crotalaria juncea L. {{at the time of}} flowering (C); addition of 15 t ha- 1 of caprine manure (E); Planting and incorporation of crotalaria + 7, 5 t ha- 1 manure (CE); and witness without crotalaria or manure (T) with four repetitions. The treatments receiving application of manure provided the largest accumulations of N, P and K by sorghum. The effect of residual organic fertilization favored larger increase in the production of dry sorghum in the crops first and second. The annual organic fertilization of potato increased the levels of P and K in the soil swappable which influenced the growth of sorghum in subsequent cultivation. The manure shows high potential to be used as organic fertilizer in the region.
