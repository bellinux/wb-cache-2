The regional conflict also had much to do {{with the emergence}} of a new tin-mining elite based in La Paz and Oruro, to the detriment of the old silver-mining establishment based in Sucre and Potosi, as symbolized by Conservative leaders such as Arce and Pacheco (both silver tycoons). To add fuel to the fire, the Liberals called for a <b>federal</b> <b>decentralization</b> of power, thus garnering further support from outlying regions of the country.|$|E
40|$|Constitutional law {{relies on}} the {{diffusion}} of powers among different institutions {{to ensure that no}} one person or faction controls power. Federalism and the separation of powers have been presented as the primary institutional arrangements generating this diffusion. Scholars and jurists alike, though, have largely neglected to consider another form of diffusion: <b>federal</b> <b>decentralization.</b> Federal power cannot be appropriately diffused if it is geographically concentrated in those in a single place. <b>Federal</b> <b>decentralization</b> ensures that federal officials in Washington and in places distant and therefore different from Washington compete with and constrain one another. This Article identifies and evaluates <b>federal</b> <b>decentralization</b> as a dimension of constitutional law. This Article first uncovers the long but lost history of <b>federal</b> <b>decentralization,</b> and places it at the core of our constitutional experience from the Founding to its current moment on constitutional center stage. The First Congress located important federal officials in a different metropolitan area than the President and Congress, and arranged for the Congress and the White House to operate in different buildings in different neighborhoods. The current Congress is considering legislation proposed by both parties that would increase <b>federal</b> <b>decentralization.</b> This Article then argues that <b>federal</b> <b>decentralization</b> makes visible the diffusions of power that federalism and separation of powers cannot provide, and executed properly attempts to provide them. It gives federalism the voice it needs, and separation of powers the exit it lacks. Federalism aspires to empower local majorities, and <b>federal</b> <b>decentralization</b> enhances the voice of local majorities by making them empowered neighbors rather than unfamiliar strangers to federal officials—or even permits local majorities to act as federal officials themselves. The separation of powers aspires to generate rivalrous branches, but rival interests can only be generated by ensuring that sometimes federal officials exit Washington rather than operate in it. <b>Federal</b> <b>decentralization,</b> though, risks injecting excessive diffusion into the American system. It therefore requires its own vocabulary to recognize and resolve the persistent set of institutional design challenges that it raises...|$|E

Amidst {{the implementation of}} <b>federal</b> <b>decentralization</b> in Ethiopia from the early 1990 s onwards, Oromo politicians and nationalists have decried continuing practical centralization of power under Tigrayan leadership (Jalata, 2001). Over the past two years, these discontents have fed large-scale protests in Ethiopia’s Oromia Regional State. It is ‘common knowledge’ in Ethiopia that these protests are supported by diaspora political leaders, especially diaspora activists connected to media outlets such as the Oromia Media Network. Quantitative data are scant, but an analysis of multiple ethnicities leads to tentative observations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the case for}} fiscal federal transfers in a Monetary Union. Looking at the labor market structure, it emphasizes the incentive effect of any federal transfer scheme insuring workers against bad draws. When the wage negociation process occurs {{at the national level}} and the federal government has incomplete information on the bargaining process, workers have an incentive to ask ex-ante for higher wages. This may negatively affect the macroeconomic performance in the federation. The First Best solution consists in shifting the wage bargaining process from the national to the <b>federal</b> level. <b>Decentralization</b> of fiscal policy would solve the incentive problem. However, looking at the fiscal federalism issue, we show that it is always optimal to keep federal transfers. Moreover, decentralized policies are only effective when access to financial markets is imperfect. Thus the paper makes a strong case in favor of centralization. ...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{research}} on party aggregation {{focuses on the}} national level, relating it {{to changes in the}} federal distribution of powers. I argue that party aggregation also affects sub-national party systems, and therefore that study of party aggregation needs to extend beyond the national level. A comparative analysis reveals that party aggregation at the Indian sub-national (state) level does not respond uniformly to changes in the federal distribution of powers. While federal centralization has positive and significant effects on the number of parties in Indian states, the effects of <b>federal</b> <b>decentralization</b> are relatively less important. Further-more, Indian states that are highly dependent on the national govern-ment have fewer parties and a higher degree of party aggregation. I conclude that existing analysis of party aggregation is simplistic, and that we need to develop a more comprehensive set of explanatory factors by which to study this phenomenon and to extend research in this area to the sub-national level.

40|$|Abstract: Citizens {{in stable}} democracies value {{democracy}} and take costly actions {{to defend its}} institutions. The design of optimal political institutions and a governance structure becomes important {{and the rule of}} law is a central feature of limited government. Inter temporal commitment of government is crucial and successful democracies satisfy the limit condition. There is a coordination dilemma about the appropriate limits on the state. Therefore, an alternative strategy is to initiate democracy at the local level, since <b>federal</b> <b>decentralization</b> of authority places limits on the center. This paper analyses democracy, democratic stability and the role of political parties in Argentina and Australia from 1880 to 1940 s. The states’ ability to coordinate is critical to confront the central government opportunism. The experience of Australia and Argentina reveals that different institutional environments have consequences for social consensus and collective action. The paper describes the evolution of federalism in both countries, in particular focusing in the imposition of income tax. Fil: Saporiti, Patricia A. Universidad Católica Argentina.

40|$|Decentralization {{reflects}} a global trend {{to increase the}} responsiveness {{of state and local}} governments to economic forces, but it raises the challenge of how to secure redistributive goals. Theoretically, as the equalizing impact of federal aid declines under devolution, we expect subnational state-level government policy to become more important, and geographic diversity in local governments’ efforts to raise revenue to increase. In this paper we explore the impact of state fiscal centralization and intergovernmental aid on local revenue effort with the aid of Census of Governments data for county areas from 1987 for the Mid-Atlantic and East North Central region of the United States, with particular attention paid to rural counties. The 1987 period was chosen because it is the first year in which state policy trends diverged from <b>federal</b> <b>decentralization</b> trends and both state aid and state centralization increased while federal aid to localities continued to decline. Using a neural-network approach, we explore the spatially differentiated impact of state policy and find complementary responses in effort among some localities and substitution responses among others. Classification-tree analysis of this diversity suggests that decentralization and the competitive government it promotes are likely to exacerbate inequality among local governments. ...|$|E
40|$|Summary In this study, {{we present}} {{evidence}} from Mexico regarding the weak effectiveness of federal transfers and low absorption capacity of sub-national governments in poor areas, when political opportunistic behavior is present. We {{show that the}} distribution of conditional transfers is discretionary, due to a monitoring problem, and deficiency in institutional frameworks. This may be the cause for opportunistic behavior by political elites. The results suggest that more funds are distributed to areas with more voters. In addition, localities with a higher number of swing voters also receive more resources.

40|$|The "third wave of democratization" has {{produced}} different experiences {{and results in}} countries that have participated in it. In some, redemocratization has meant the drafting of "refounding" constitutions, generating new political and social pacts and commitments. In others, redemocratization {{has been accompanied by}} policy-making and financial decentralization to sub-national governmental levels. In many <b>federal</b> countries, redemocratization, <b>decentralization,</b> and new constitutions have changed the role of federative bodies. In Brazil, all these factors have occurred simultaneously. This article analyzes the decision-making process in the National Constituent Assembly vis-à-vis changes in the Federation and the decision to decentralize policy-making and financial power to the sub-national levels. The (re) construction of a federal system focused on the division of political and fiscal power without leading to an imbalance between the federative bodies is an intrinsically contradictory task, thereby generating conflicts and tensions. Based on empirical data, the study seeks to understand a) the paradox of a country with an agenda of problems that require national policies in the decision to decentralize political and financial power and b) the conflicts, alliances, and contradictions generated by the decisions made by members of the Constituent Assembly in relation to the Federation at that specific moment in history...|$|R
40|$|The Russian federal {{government}} has recently initiated a fundamental reform of its budget system, encompassing important policy, procedural, and institutional changes. This paper reviews this reform agenda {{with reference to the}} experience of industrial countries that over the past two to three decades have followed a similar reform path toward a more devolved budget management system. From this perspective, the importance of the strength of existing public expenditure management systems to accommodate increased devolution and the scope for employing decentralized agencies is explored. An assessment of the present Russian reform plans in light of this review reveals a number of concerns. First, the speed of the reforms contemplated appears overly ambitious when judged by the experience of other countries. Second, the preparedness of budget institutions is questionable. Third, change management capacity needs strengthening with a more carefully defined strategy. Last, in light of these concerns, it is argued that the scope and "big-bang" approach of the current reform plans may need reformulation into a more sequenced strategy with clearer reform priorities.

40|$|What is {{it about}} federal {{governance}} that makes it so attractive to economists, political philosophers and legal scholars {{and is there any}} evidence that would suggest all this attention is warranted? Proponents see federalism as a means to more efficient public and private economies, as the foundation for increased political participation and democratic stability and as an important check on governmental abuses of personal rights and liberties. This study provides a working definition of federal governance and classifies a sample of 73 countries as either a constitutionally based federal democracy, an administratively based federal democracy, a unitary democracy, a federal dictatorship or a unitary dictatorship. Governance is then related to 11 measures of economic, democratic, and rights performance. Three conclusions follow. First, decentralized policy-making does have a unique contribution to make to a society 2 ̆ 7 s ability to enforce property rights, to protect political and civil rights, and then because of such rights protections, to enhance private sector economic performance. Second, while policy decentralization is the key to federalism 2 ̆ 7 s strong rights and economic performance and can be achieved within a unitary government by fiat, constitutionally established provincial (or state) governments provide an extra and important protective barrier for policy <b>decentralization.</b> <b>Federal</b> institutions protect policy decentralization, and policy decentralization provides federalism 2 ̆ 7 s valued outcomes.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} history of regions, centralism and {{regionalism}} in Italy - a highly controversial political field of state reorganization over 150 years. Focusing {{on the status of}} regions within Italy's political power structure and the development of the multi-level governance system, the article draws a line from the foundation of the Italian national state in 1860 / 61 to the immediate present. It examines political aspirations for decentralized structures and changing perceptions of how to reorganize the state to create efficient structures in different eras as well as power shifts between the different political levels. The article shows that Italian politics oscillated between centralism and regionalism. Reforms took place against the backdrop of different political systems and public debates in a heterogonous country. Since the mid-nineteenth century, the Italian public discussed a <b>federal</b> structure and <b>decentralization.</b> Altogether, reforms were implemented inconsistently, slowly and gradually: The long-term analysis highlights the complexity of constitutional reforms within the background of a set of actor’s including regionalist movements, political parties and traditionalist and regionalist sentiments. What we observe is a highly ideological debate on decentralization followed by reservations and resistances across the state. The article concludes that looking at today’s Italian politics, attempts for recentralization are gaining ground again. However, the article identifies several dimensions of state transformation. Notions of efficiency and legitimacy have to be taken in account just as much as regional self-interests, diverse structures inherited from the past and the asymmetry of the Italian federalist system. The author stresses the need for a more holistic approach, for a detailed examination of the relationship between those dimensions together with a shift in global power structures. The contribution thus proceeds to develop a multifaceted framework in order to facilitate further research, to understand more fully the shift of power within the Italian multi-level system...|$|R
40|$|Building up {{a rule of}} law is one of the {{objectives}} of transition. This objective, however, cannot be separated from the other main objectives, namely a market economy and democracy. These have all been developed simultaneously in Russia and the failure of one task affects the others. "Rebuilding a ship at sea" is an unavoidable vicious circle, but it is the only possible way of transition for Russia, even if it means constant failures and setbacks. The Constitution of the Russian Federation from 1993 technically contains all the bricks needed to build constitutionalism. The separation of powers between the state organs is established as well as a judicial body to guard the Constitution. Newly gained independence of the courts is an important prerequisite for developing the rule of law. There is, however, an institutional setup hindering this development. The political culture {{still has a long way}} to develop to the stage of constitutionalism. Authoritarian presidential power, which was the result of the hectic power struggle between the legislative and the executive after separation of powers, enabled an excessively powerful presidency to be the winner of the struggle. A weak party system and an underdeveloped civil society allow authoritarian rule of the president to go even further than the constitution permits. For the same reason corrupted politics can continue. The development of the rule of law has largely been left to the courts and lawyers. The Constitutional Court has, however, chosen a cautious attitude towards presidential power after having supported the legislative in the power struggle and being suspended by the President. If the balance between federal state organs is not yet found, the question of federalism is at an even more underdeveloped stage. Federalism is not developed in an open, transparent and democratic way, but in a power struggle between the center and the powers including fiscal federalism. The center has tried to regain the power, which was given to the regions during the power struggle at the federal center. This is done with the help of new federal laws increasing the powers of the federal center. The Presidential Administration has extended the federal executive power and the President has tried to change regionalist governors into "his own men". The Constitutional Court has repeatedly interpreted the Constitution in favor of the <b>federal</b> center. <b>Decentralization</b> has been developed through the back door with administrative treaties between the federation and different subjects of the federation. These treaties all differ from each other and usually contradict the federal constitution. They also contain secret provisions. These treaties have been a political necessity to prevent the federation from falling apart. In the hierarchy legal norms they are, however, submitted under the Constitution, which makes them vulnerable from the legal point of view. ...|$|R
