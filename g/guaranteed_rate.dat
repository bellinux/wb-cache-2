If one wants to compare their change in purchasing power, then they should use the real interest rate (nominal interest rate minus inflation rate).|$|E

The Chicago Cubs of the National League play in the second-oldest major league stadium (Wrigley Field) and are widely known for having the longest {{championship}} drought in all of major American sport: not winning the World Series since 1908. That drought finally came to an end when the Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians in seven games to win the 2016 World Series.

25|$|The {{city has}} two Major League Baseball (MLB) teams: the Chicago Cubs of the National League play in Wrigley Field on the North Side; and the Chicago White Sox of the American League play in <b>Guaranteed</b> <b>Rate</b> Field on the South Side. Chicago {{is the only}} city that has {{had more than one}} MLB {{franchise}} every year since the AL began in 1901 (New York hosted only one between 1958 and early 1962). The Cubs are the oldest Major League Baseball team to have never changed their city; they have played in Chicago since 1871, and continuously so since 1874 due to the Great Chicago Fire. They have played more games and have more wins than any other team in Major League baseball since 1876. They have won three World Series titles, including the 2016 World Series, but had the dubious honor of having the two longest droughts in American professional sports: They had not won their sport's title since 1908, and had not participated in a World Series since 1945, both records, until they beat the Cleveland Indians in the 2016 World Series.|$|E

500|$|The {{symbolism}} of the flag now serves {{a wide variety of}} purposes. [...] It is commonly reproduced in [...] dimensions, and car flag versions are also sold. [...] The flag is also available in [...] dimension versions. [...] The flag has become a celebratory symbol for Chicago Cubs fans who purchase reproductions and take them to games at home and on the road to show support. The fans wave them after victories at Wrigley Field, and they hang them in the stands during playoff series. [...] Some fans fly a win flag in place of or in addition to the Flag of the United States on days when the Cubs win. Since 1998, the flags have become ever more popular, with demand reaching a level where they are sold at Wrigley Field. In 2007, with the Cubs in playoff contention {{for the first time in}} 3 years, the Cubs' victory tune, Go Cubs Go! became more popular among the fans. Due to the song's growing popularity, after wins at home, Cubs TV broadcasters Len Kasper and Bob Brenly would have their microphones shut off, while the camera pans around the stadium to view the jubilant fans as Go Cubs Go! plays in the background. After fans discovered this, they started purchasing [...] "W" [...] flags and waving them after wins at home as an attempt to get on TV. However, in seasons when the Cubs are performing poorly the tradition has led to parody and satire, such as stories of the Cubs retiring the win flag due to signs of neglect. While not having the popularity of the Win Flag, the Loss Flag has become increasingly popular with clubs who traditionally have rivalries with the Cubs, such as the St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, or Chicago White Sox. Fans of those teams wave the blue flag after their team defeats the Cubs at Busch Stadium or <b>Guaranteed</b> <b>Rate</b> Field. However, because of the enormous fan base that the Cubs hold, it isn't uncommon to see fans at games on the road waving their [...] "W" [...] flags during Cubs wins on the road.|$|E

Belle later moved to the White Sox in 1997, making the rivalry even more intense.|$|E

In the following game, Bellinger became the first Dodgers rookie to hit for the cycle and Wood pitched six shutout innings to become the first pitcher in franchise history to win his first 11 decisions as the Dodgers won the game 7–1. The Dodgers finished off their third straight series sweep with a 3–2 win over the Marlins.

[...] In the second game, Kenta Maeda allowed one run in five innings while the Dodgers hit four home runs (two by Kike Hernández) en route to a rain shortened 9–1 win.
