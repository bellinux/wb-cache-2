40|$|Feedback is a {{constituent}} part of three assessment approaches: assessment for/as/of learning. Feedback about students’ learning and performance differs {{in the three}} approaches with respect to manner and purpose. Feedback associated with assessment of learning {{is representative of the}} traditional way of teaching, its role reduced to mere reporting of a score or grade. However, in the context of assessment for learning and assessment as learning, feedback plays a more significant role. It implies having a clear understanding of how, when and why <b>feedback</b> is <b>given</b> <b>in</b> addition to involving students <b>in</b> <b>giving</b> <b>feedback.</b> This preliminary research on a sample of primary school English language teachers in Croatia focuses on tendencies <b>in</b> <b>giving</b> <b>feedback</b> and some general characteristics of feedback given to students within the assessment for learning approach.

40|$|Theoretical {{results that}} enable {{rigorous}} statements of convergence and exponential stability of Galerkin approximations of LQR controls for infinite dimensional, or distributed parameter, systems have proliferated {{over the past}} ten years. In addition, extensive progress has been made over the same time period in the derivation of robust control design strategies for finite dimensional systems. However, the study of the convergence of robust finite dimensional controllers to robust controllers for infinite dimensional systems remains an active area of research. We consider a class of soft-constrained differential games evolving in a Hilbert space. Under certain conditions, a saddle point control can be <b>given</b> <b>in</b> <b>feedback</b> form in terms of a solution to a Riccati equation. By considering a related LQR problem, we can show a convergence result for finite dimensional approximations of this differential game. This yields a computational algorithm for the feedback gain that can be derived from similar strategies employed in infinite dimensional LQR control design problems. The approach described in this paper also inherits the additional properties of stability robustness common to game theoretic methods in finite dimensional analysis. These theoretical convergence and stability results are verified in several numerical experiments...|$|E

Four research questions were formulated in this study. They are (1) What types of feedback does the teacher <b>give</b> <b>in</b> the speaking activities? (2) What categories of feedback does the teacher <b>give</b> <b>in</b> the speaking activities? (3) What are the teacher’s purposes <b>in</b> <b>giving</b> such <b>feedback</b> <b>in</b> the speaking activities and (4) What are the students’ perceptions of teacher’s <b>feedback</b> <b>in</b> the speaking activities? This research used a descriptive qualitative design. It applied an observational method to collect the data. It means that the data of the research were obtained through careful observations in the natural setting where the research was conducted. The study involved {{the teacher and the}} students of the ninth grade of SMP N 2 Depok in the first term of the academic year of 2011. Observations were done by attending the speaking classes and making field notes of all what happened in the classroom setting during the speaking learning and teaching process. With the help of audio recorder, the researcher recorded all the speech events of the classroom community members under observation. This audio recording technique enabled the researcher to preserve the authenticity of the data. To gain comprehensive and accurate data, the researcher crosschecked the data obtained by comparing these data with those which were obtained by interviewing some of the students and the English teacher involved in the research. The researcher also distributed the questionnaire to all {{of the students in the}} class. These accurate data where then (1) transcribed, (2) read, (3) identified, (4) categorized, and (5) analyzed to answer the research questions as those which were mentioned in the formulation of the problem. To check the trustworthiness of the data, triangulation was also used. The researcher compared the gathered data with other relevant researches and theories and consulted the lecturers involved in the study. Based on the analysis of teacher’s feedback, it is figured out that the teacher mostly <b>gave</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>in</b> the form of explicit corrections. Also, the teacher’s feedback focused more on the phonological errors, especially pronunciation. The teacher’s purposes <b>in</b> <b>giving</b> <b>feedback</b> were (1) providing information for teacher and students, (2) providing advice to the students, (3) providing students with language input, (4) motivating the students, and (5) leading students toward autonomy.

What is the relationship of teachers 2 ̆ 7 self-efficacy <b>in</b> <b>giving</b> student <b>feedback</b> to the following demographic variables: years of teaching experience and content area of teaching? 3.

Responses were received from participants (N= 77) representing staff at an inner city public high school in New England. ^ Quantitatively, the most significant findings included: the highest ratings were found for confidence <b>in</b> <b>giving</b> oral <b>feedback</b> (M= 4. 41); teachers with three or less years of teaching experienced lower confidence levels for all elements of Feedback By Years of Teaching (M= 3. 53); inspection of the data for Clear Expectations by Years of Teaching indicated teachers with one to three years experience reported less confidence than teachers with four or more years of teaching experience on the item clear expectations to impact student achievement (M= 3. 80). In analyzing the qualitative data, using the long table approach (Krueger 2 ̆ 6 Casey, 2009), five major themes that emerged regarding teacher self efficacy <b>in</b> <b>giving</b> <b>feedback</b> to students: motivation to improve, deepen understanding, accepting constructive feedback, time, and language barrier for English Language Learners and special education students. ^ The findings of this study may benefit educational leaders in strengthening teacher self-efficacy <b>in</b> <b>giving</b> effective <b>feedback</b> to students as part of classroom culture in the school setting. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to {{investigate}} two aspects, first to explore written academic feedback as a genre and second, to use corpus approaches to investigate any significant strategy revealed by the genre study. Feedback reports were gathered from two Humanities departments from undergraduate students who were doing an English programme in a UK higher education institution.
