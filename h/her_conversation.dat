5|$|Unless {{the player}} imports a Mass Effect 2 saved game where Tali cannot appear in Mass Effect 3, Tali shows when the Commander moves to recruit the quarian fleet {{in the fight}} against the Reapers, {{powerful}} sapient cyborgs with intentions to destroy all life. Tali joins the squad, and <b>her</b> <b>conversation</b> options tell of the quarians' new attack on the now Reaper-allied geth, in a bid by the quarians to try and reclaim their homeworld. Depending on the player's choices in the second game, Tali may either be an Admiral or merely an advisor on how to defeat the geth. Eventually, the player must choose between saving the geth or the quarians, or, if certain conditions are fulfilled, negotiating a stand-down and saving both parties. If the player sides with the geth and lets the quarians die, Tali kills herself; otherwise, she fully joins the squad and can be found interacting with other Normandy crew members. Admiral Shala'Raan vas Tonbay fulfills Tali's role in saved games where Tali cannot appear in-game. Shala'Raan does not join Shepard's squad.|$|E

She would go see him sing {{and after a few}} drinks, <b>her</b> <b>conversation</b> would turn to things she and Clark were doing. Murray was alarmed and implied that he might tell the police. In order to avoid this from happening, in August 1980, Bundy lured Murray into his van after a show to have sex. Once they were inside, she shot him and decapitated him. She left various clues behind, however, such as the fact {{that the two of them}} were seen together in the bar, and she had left shell casings in the van. Bundy couldn't take the pressure and two days later she confessed to her co-workers that she had killed Murray. They called the police and she began to give them a full and to-the-point confession about her and Clark's crimes.|$|E
25|$|Ettinger had a solo {{project at}} the Pompidou Centre in 1987, and a solo {{exhibition}} at the Museum of Calais in 1988. In 1995 she had a solo exhibition at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, and in 1996 she participated in the Contemporary art section of Face à l'Histoire. 1933–1996 exhibition in the Pompidou Centre. In 2000 she had a mid-life retrospective at the Centre for Fine Arts (The Palais des Beaux Arts) in Brussels, and in 2001 a solo exhibition at the Drawing Center in New York. As well as working as an artist, Ettinger continued to train as psychoanalyst with Françoise Dolto, Piera Auglanier, Pierre Fedida, and Jacques-Alain Miller, and has become an influential contemporary French feminist. Around 1988 Ettinger began <b>her</b> <b>Conversation</b> and Photography project. Her personal art notebooks have become source for theoretical articulations, and her art has inspired art historians (among them the distinguished art historian Griselda Pollock and international curator Catherine de Zegher) and philosophers (like Jean-François Lyotard, Christine Buci-Glucksmann and Brian Massumi) who dedicated a number of essays to her painting.|$|E
25|$|As {{the year}} moves on, Den decides {{that he wants}} to leave Angie so he can marry Jan. He finally gets round to telling Angie his {{intentions}} in October, after which Angie becomes distraught. Desperate to hold on to her husband, she announces that she is terminally ill and only has six months to live. Upon hearing this, Den becomes wracked with guilt, and so decides to revise his plans and stay with Angie. He sets about organising a second honeymoon for them in Venice. However, their holiday is ruined when Jan arrives, and upon seeing her and Den together, Angie starts drinking again having not long given up. On the way home from Venice on the Orient Express, a drunk Angie tells the barman all about her big lie. Unfortunately for Angie, Den overhears every word, and from that moment on he reverts to his original plan to leave her, although he decides to wait a while before letting Angie know that he knows about her lie. On Christmas Day that year, Den decides to get his revenge. Thinking that her marriage is safe, Angie is happier than ever - until Den informs her that he'd overheard <b>her</b> <b>conversation</b> with the barman, and he then serves her divorce papers as a Christmas present. This episode had the highest number of viewers the show has ever seen - with more than 30 million viewers (more than half of the British population) tuning in to see it. In response, Angie and Sharon pack their bags and walk out of the pub, choosing to take the route through the public area to cause Den the most embarrassment possible.|$|E

Peter tells Fauxlivia that living with Walter is like a bad buddy cop movie, referring to a genre of movies that have two men of very different and conflicting personalities forced to work together.|$|E

[...] She confirmed that the incident further inspired [...] "Swine", saying, [...] "I wrote a song called 'Swine'; the song is about rape. The song is about demoralization.

500|$|A {{major theme}} of the episode is the humanization of [...] "Caprica-Six" [...] while Caprica-Six shows her {{manipulative}} streak {{in parts of the}} episode, in particular during <b>her</b> <b>conversation</b> in the beach-side house with Boomer, the destruction of the Twelve Colonies and her love of Baltar have somewhat changed her psychology. Conversely, Boomer shows resistance to her Cylon nature. Series creator Ronald D. Moore found the scene that took place in Boomer's apartment interesting as it showed a major amount of her backstory. It also serves the purpose of Boomer's denial that her memories were manufactured, and that the Cylons are more passive than humans. Another major subplot is the [...] "Virtual Baltar" [...] only visible by Caprica-Six, which Moore commented was a [...] "delicious symmetry" [...] to Baltar's [...] "Virtual Six". Both were intended to show how the couple had been changed through experience, in particular, the events of the miniseries.|$|E

She does not, however, see theory as confined to academic literature and <b>her</b> <b>conversations</b> extend into poetry as well.

5000|$|After {{some time}} and {{detailed}} examinations, the Holy See has, however, recognized a few post-Ascension conversations with Jesus as valid. In his 1928 encyclical Miserentissimus Redemptor Pope Pius XI stated that Jesus Christ had [...] "manifested Himself" [...] to Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque in the 17th Century. The encyclical refers to the conversation between Jesus and Saint Margaret Mary several times. The Vatican biography of Saint Teresa of Ávila refers to her gift of interior locution and <b>her</b> <b>conversations</b> with Jesus. The Vatican biography of Saint Juan Diego discusses his conversation with the Virgin Mary.

500|$|She {{was also}} an {{inspiration}} to poet Walt Whitman, who believed in her call for the forging of a new national identity and a truly American literature. Elizabeth Barrett Browning was also a strong admirer, but believed that Fuller's unconventional views were unappreciated in the United States and, therefore, she was better off dead. She also said that Fuller's history of the Roman Republic would have been her greatest work: [...] "The work she was preparing upon Italy {{would probably have been}} more equal to her faculty than anything previously produced by her pen (her other writings being curiously inferior to the impressions <b>her</b> <b>conversation</b> gave you)". An 1860 essay collection, Historical Pictures Retouched, by Caroline Healey Dall, called Fuller's Woman in the Nineteenth Century [...] "doubtless the most brilliant, complete, and scholarly statement ever made on the subject". Despite his personal issues with Fuller, the typically harsh literary critic Edgar Allan Poe wrote of the work as [...] "a book which few women in the country could have written, and no woman in the country would have published, with the exception of Miss Fuller", noting its [...] "independence" [...] and [...] "unmitigated radicalism". Thoreau also thought highly of the book, suggesting that its strength came in part from Fuller's conversational ability. As he called it, it was [...] "rich extempore writing, talking with pen in hand".|$|E
500|$|American {{officials}} said {{according to the}} New York Times that Hillary Clinton's increasingly cordial relationship with the young Pakistani foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar paid dividends in resolving the dispute between both countries over the Salala incident. A final agreement on the wording of Clinton's statement of <b>her</b> <b>conversation</b> with Khar came {{after a week of}} marathon talks that included two trips to Islamabad by General John R. Allen, the US commander in Afghanistan, and a quickly arranged weekend trip by Thomas R. Nides, the deputy secretary of state for management and resources. In recent weeks Nides and Pakistani Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh had spearheaded the negotiations to reopen the supply lines. After weeks of behind-the-scenes phone calls, e-mails and meetings between Nides and Abdul Hafeez Shaikh reached an agreement on the terms for the reopening of the NATO supply lines. Besides the US apology both sides agreed to the following: After initially demanding as much as $5,000 for each truck Pakistan dropped its insistence on a higher transit fee for each truck carrying NATO’s nonlethal supplies from Pakistan into Afghanistan and agreed to keep the fee at the current rate of $250. The Obama Administration will ask Congress to reimburse Pakistan about $1.2 billion for costs incurred by 150,000 Pakistani troops carrying out counterinsurgency operations along the border with Afghanistan. [...] "With the GLOCs open, we will look to pay past coalition support fund claims," [...] Pentagon spokesman Captain John Kirby said, using a Pentagon acronym for the supply routes. The United States military reimburses by [...] "coalition support funds" [...] Pakistan for logistical, military and other support provided to American military operations against militants, but these payments have been suspended since Pakistan shut off the routes. More precisely the US halted paying the bills from Pakistan as tension rose between the two countries.|$|E
