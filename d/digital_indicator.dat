This indicator displays the deviation from the preset dimension and the indicator may have high and low tolerance limits marked by means of two extra needles, alteration of the dial face, or programming into an electronic indicator.

This [...] manual recording of long columns of numbers, which not only reduces the risk of the operator introducing errors (such as digit [...] ) but also greatly improves the productivity of the process by freeing the human from time-consuming data recording and copying tasks. Another advantage is that they can be switched between metric and inch units with the press of a button, thus [...] a separate unit conversion step of typing into a calculator or web browser and then typing the results.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the Information Communication Technology (ICT) era, {{teachers}} {{will have to}} wisely use the online environment in order to realize a new pedagogy. We developed a <b>digital</b> <b>indicator</b> for examining {{the extent to which}} technological knowledge is integrated with pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK). This indicator is used to examine online tasks developed by teachers in different subjects over time. It enables quantitative measurement of the integration of technological knowledge with content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge and thus affords a measure for the extent of integration. The <b>digital</b> <b>indicator</b> can be used to plan online tasks {{as well as for the}} teachers to test their own professional development in integrating technology in teaching. Use of the <b>digital</b> <b>indicator</b> can be implemented when training student teachers as well as in in-service training for teachers. Fifty-three online tasks developed by 14 high school teachers in different subjects were evaluated between 2001 and 2007. Evaluation of the online tasks was performed quantitatively using the digital evaluation instrument after it was validated and its reliability was examined. We examined the change and progress which took place in the integration of technological knowledge with pedagogical content knowledge over time as well as the contribution of guidance to the teachers’ professional development for integration of technology in teaching. The findings indicate that the effect of time, which is expressed by the acquisition of experience, contributes to the integration of the technological knowledge with the teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge. The findings also indicate that guidance plays a significant role in the implementation of the integration of technological knowledge with the teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge. We recommend that correct integration of TPACK should be emphasized when planning professional development for teachers in the field of online tasks. We also recommend the development of models for teachers’ professional development for integration of technology in teaching, with reference to the teachers’ professional knowledge, i. e. their pedagogical content knowledge. The best ways for integrating the technological knowledge must be examined, such that the focus will not be on learning technological tools, but rather on the integration of pedagogy in technology. It is necessary to start from the field of knowledge and the teaching methods appropriate for this particular field of knowledge, and there to integrate technology. Optimal integration will lead to a change in teaching, to relevance for the students and to meaningful learning...|$|E

The penetration of the internet into different fields of teaching and learning may {{have a significant effect on}} the quality of teaching. Numerous researchers claim that time is needed in order to examine the real effects of technology on pedagogy (Gao et al. 2006; Hui et al. 2005) and on the teachers in the field "to harness the horses of technology to the cart of pedagogy" (Noski et al. 2006). However, the new learning environment must be created on a rational pedagogical basis and not only on a technological basis (Salomon 2000). The theoretical part of this article describes online learning, the characteristics of knowledge required of teachers who integrate technology in teaching, the characteristics of an online task, and various indicators for evaluating an online task. Because we did not find a dynamic and <b>digital</b> <b>indicator</b> for evaluating the quality of online tasks which encompasses all of the aspects which in our opinion should be expressed in an indicator, such as PK, PCK, TK and TPACK, which is actually the space expected to be expressed in an online task, we developed a <b>digital</b> <b>indicator</b> that evaluates the quality of online tasks.

Acrylic resin mandibular overdentures were fabricated and provision was made to receive three different overdenture attachment systems, prefabricated ball/o-ring attachment (Lifecare Biosystems, Thane, India), Hader bar and clip attachment (Sterngold, Attleboro, MA), and Locator ® implant overdenture attachment stud type (Zest Anchors LLC, USA).
