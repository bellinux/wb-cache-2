40|$|The {{concept of}} {{integrated}} seed sector development (ISSD) for sweetpotato was tested in Shinyanga and Meatu districts of the Lake Zone of Tanzania. Agricultural Research Institute (ARI) –Ukiriguru documented the informal system. It comprised male and <b>female</b> <b>vine</b> multipliers with land close to water sources growing sweetpotato {{during the dry}} season. They sold vines during the rainy season, with male multipliers and those with larger crops selling more. The average multiplier supplied approximately 50 farmers who commonly travelled 20 km, each buying approximately 1 – 2 bundles of vine and provided an entry point for disseminating technologies. ARI–Ukiriguru organized demonstrations of rapid multiplication, inorganic and organic fertilizers and new cultivars on multipliers’ land. Fertilizer could economically more than double vine yields with huge potential benefits for an area where production is constrained by planting material; some multipliers immediately began using it. Multipliers took rapid multiplication and new cultivars to their home gardens for further experimentation, seeming likely to adopt especially the cultivar NASPOT 1. A strategy of growing large quantities of irrigated sweetpotato in Misungwi and selling the vines long-distance in Shinyanga, a marketing strategy derived from Uganda, was also adopted. These successes confirm the value of formal-informal seed sector interactions in ISSD...|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the plants}} require a male plant to {{pollinate}} a female plant for the female plant to produce fruit (dioecious). For a good yield of fruit, one male vine for every three to eight <b>female</b> <b>vines</b> is required. Other varieties can self pollinate, but they produce a greater and more reliable yield when pollinated by male kiwifruit vines.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} act of cultivation {{appears to}} have been the favoring of hermaphroditic members of the Vitis vinifera species over the barren male <b>vines</b> and the <b>female</b> <b>vines,</b> which were dependent on a nearby male for pollination. With the ability to pollinate itself, over time the hermaphroditic vines were able to sire offspring that were consistently hermaphroditic.|$|R

40|$|Presence of Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), {{the causal}} agent of {{bacterial}} canker of kiwifruit, in pollen samples collected from infected and non infected orchards in Italy and in New Zealand {{was determined by}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and by direct bacterial isolation. Psa was isolated only from pollen samples collected in Italy, including pollen collected from two uninfected orchards, which the following year showed signs of infection. Psa was also detected in pollen collected from male and <b>female</b> <b>vines</b> in an Italian infected orchard. Pollen samples from Italy, but not from New Zealand, were collected with a vacuum device. Psa could not be isolated {{from any of the}} 25 New Zealand pollen samples analysed. This is the first report of Psa being associated with pollen. There is currently no evidence that artificial pollination leads to increased infection or that pollen has been responsible for the introduction of Psa in a previously Psa-free are...|$|R
2500|$|The Zagros Mountains, which {{separate}} {{modern day}} Iran from Armenia, Iraq and Turkey, {{is home to}} many wild species of grapevines in the Vitis family. While wild vines are distinguished by separate male and <b>female</b> <b>vines,</b> the potential for pollination {{and the production of}} grapes could have easily happened, providing the Aryan inhabitants access to grapes. Several archaeological sites in the Zagros Mountains have uncovered similar findings as Hajji Firuz Tepe of jars containing tartaric deposits and wine residues. South of Hajji Firuz Tepe is Godin Tepe, a site that appears to have been inhabited just after the neolithic period (around 3500–3000 BC). Archaeologists there have discovered even more evidence of large scale winemaking with [...] and [...] wine jars as well as large basins containing wine residue, indicating that they might have been used for treading grapes as an early wine press. The residue on the jars was also found {{on the side of the}} containers, rather than the bottom, indicating that these jars were kept on their side, most likely for long term storage.|$|R
40|$|Bacterial canker of kiwifruit, {{caused by}} Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) biovar 3, was first {{recorded}} in New Zealand in November 2010 and quickly made {{production of the}} goldfleshed kiwifruit cultivar, ‘Hort 16 A’, which is highly susceptible to Psa, no longer viable in the Bay of Plenty region. Production of the green-fleshed cultivar, ‘Hayward’ has remained viable but there is uncertainty around its long-term productivity. This thesis investigated aspects of Psa in commercial ‘Hayward’ orchards using observational studies. The aims were to: 1) quantify a change in productivity associated with disease; 2) determine the prevalence of disease in orchards; 3) identify factors that altered the initial development of disease and 4) identify factors that impact {{on the presence of}} severe disease. Severe disease was defined as 5 % or more <b>female</b> <b>vines</b> in a block showing the systemic symptoms of green shoot wilt and cane dieback. To determine Psa effects on productivity historical data from 2599 ‘Hayward’ orchards were analysed. No reduction in productivity was found until 1 year after initial detection of Psa, after controlling for other orchard inputs that affect productivity. A crosssectional survey was sent to all Psa confirmed ‘Hayward’ orchards and 430 growers provided information about one of their ‘Hayward’ orchard blocks. The survey found 84 % of orchard blocks were affected by disease and 57 % had green shoot-wilt and/or cane dieback reported. Blocks typically had a low within block prevalence of systemic symptoms (Median = 5 % of vines). In 194 orchards that were asymptomatic {{at the start of the}} study period the probability of disease developing in a block increased in association with use of Psa protectant sprays immediately post-pruning and using artificial pollination. A lower probability of disease developing was associated with undertaking summer girdling and with the presence of older male vines. The probability of developing severe disease was investigated in 331 orchard blocks that were symptomatic. The probability increased with time after Psa was first detected in a block and was highest when frost damage occurred, when poplar, cypress or pine shelter belts were present and when artificial pollination was used. The probability of severe bacterial canker was lower when spring girdling of <b>female</b> <b>vines</b> was undertaken. The results of this study can be used to prioritise future research. The thesis has also demonstrated the utility of observational studies for plant disease research...|$|R

40|$|Kiwifruit {{breeding}} programmes in New Zealand {{have produced a}} large number of seedling populations. Effective methods are required to assess seedlings, and knowledge of phenotypic and genotypic variation would facilitate the design of {{breeding programmes}}. 1. Multivariate analyses of phenotypic data Multivariate analyses were used to quantify the characters most powerful in distinguishing between seedlings and between crosses, and to examine their relationships. Seedlings and crosses were placed in order of their overall merit, and the best ones were determined. Bruno was a superior female parent for producing both floriferous male <b>vines</b> and productive <b>female</b> <b>vines</b> with high fruit vitamin C content, and D 1 - 20 was the better male parent in all crosses. Multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant analysis were more suitable to sort cross combinations, while factor analysis was more efficient for screening single seedlings within a population. Factor patterns varied between crosses, and between years for the same cross. Canonical correlation analysis proved a useful tool to obtain better understanding of the aggregates of useful vine characters and the relationship between them in fruit breeding. 2. Quantitative genetics studies Relatively high heritability was shown for the beginning date of bloom (0. 48) and flowering duration (0. 50) in male vines, and total crop weight (0. 46), percentage of shoots flowering (0. 54), fruit elongation (0. 65), and mean fruit weight (0. 52) in <b>female</b> <b>vines.</b> For these traits, the selection of superior seedlings as parent could therefore lead to rapid genetic improvement to their subsequent generations. Hairiness of fruit (- 0. 07) and percentage soluble solids in fruit (- 0. 19) gave negative heritability value, thus could not be improved efficiently by individual selection. However, their broad sense heritability was reasonably high (0. 22 and 0. 37 respectively), showing there were some dominant and/or epistatic effects involved. This indicates a possible chance improvement may occur in a large seedling population. Fruit vitamin C content (0. 22), fruit symmetry (0. 30) and relative core size (0. 13) gave moderate or low heritability values, indicating that individual selection may have only moderate success in improving these traits. Simple recurrent individual selection was shown to be an effective breeding strategy for characters of high heritability. For characters of low heritability, the family selection methods yielded a greater rate of genetic gain. Selection indices were constructed to provide a technique for improving several traits simultaneously. 3. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of leaf proteins Three regions of the protein profile were found useful for the characterisation of cultivars and seedlings. The banding patterns found in seedlings provided evidence that in the hexaploid kiwifruit the inheritance of these polypeptides occurred {{in a manner similar to}} that of a diploid. Hence the kiwifruit may have arisen as a diploidized polyploid and it is proposed the kiwifruit may be considered as allohexaploid. Progressive changes of some bands with leaf growth and development may be of interest in the study of leaf development. The possible application of leaf protein analysis to kiwifruit breeding was discussed...|$|R

40|$|In 1988 and 1989, {{flowers were}} removed before opening from all pollenizers (male vines) except that {{closest to the}} middle of an orchard block 76 m long and 24 m wide, {{containing}} 140 vines at 4 m X 4 m spacing. Fruit set decreased from 100 % in vines nearest the central male to 17 % in 1988 and to only 7 % in 1989 in the most distant vines. Mean fruit weight for each vine decreased from 110 to 34 g in 1988 and from 113 to 37 g in 1989, fruit weight decreasing the further the vine was from the pollen source. As a consequence, yield progressively decreased from vines adjacent to the pollenizer (54. 9 and 58. 9 kg per vine in 1988 and 1989, respectively) to those most distant (3. 7 and 1. 9 kg per vine in 1988 and 1989, respectively). The area covered by a pollenizer, i. e. the area within which plants produce at least half the number of seeds of those closest to the pollenizer, was 229 m 2 in 1988 and 103 m 2 in 1989. Since pollen transfer, rather than its availability, is the main factor limiting pollination, to achieve full pollination about 118 pollen sources ha- 1 must be provided in kiwifruit orchards, without regard to planting distances and canopy sizes. Male vines occupy too much canopy space and it is suggested that they be eliminated; instead, sectors of <b>female</b> <b>vines</b> at appropriate positions in the orchard should be grafted with male scionwood...|$|R
5000|$|Trichosanthes dioica, {{also known}} as parval or pointed gourd, is a vine plant in the Cucurbitaceae family, similar to {{cucumber}} and squash, though unlike those it is perennial. It is a dioecious (male and <b>female</b> plants) <b>vine</b> (creeper) plant with heart-shaped leaves (cordate) and is grown on a trellis. The fruits are green with white or no stripes.
