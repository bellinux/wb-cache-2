5|$|Individual {{athletes have}} {{also used the}} Olympic stage to promote their own {{political}} agenda. At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, two American track and field athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who finished first and third in the 200metres, performed the Black Power salute on the victory stand. The second-place finisher, Peter Norman of Australia, wore an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge in support of Smith and Carlos. In response to the protest, IOC president Avery Brundage told the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) to either send the two athletes home or withdraw the track and field team. The USOC opted for the former. During the same Olympics, Czechoslovakian gymnast Věra Čáslavská announced her protest to the Soviet-led invasion of her home country after controversially receiving Silver on the Beam and a shared Gold on the Floor. During the Soviet anthem, Čáslavská turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> {{and to the right}} of the Soviet flag in order to make a statement over the invasion and the Soviet influence of the sport of Gymnastics. Returning home, Čáslavská was made an outcast by the Soviet government and was banned from competition and travelling.|$|E
25|$|As {{the young}} queen larva pupates with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> the workers cap the queen cell with beeswax. When ready to emerge, the virgin queen will chew a {{circular}} cut around the cap of her cell. Often the cap swings open {{when most of}} the cut is made, so as to appear like a hinged lid.|$|E
25|$|At the Olympics, {{where she}} once again faced Soviet opposition, Čáslavská {{continued}} to subtly voice her views. After {{she appeared to}} have {{won the gold medal}} on floor outright, the judging panel curiously upgraded the preliminary scores of Soviet Larisa Petrik, and declared a tie for the gold instead. All of this occurred on the heels of another very controversial judging decision that cost Čáslavská the gold on beam, instead awarding the title to Soviet rival Natalia Kuchinskaya. Clearly disheartened and angered by the politics that favored the USSR, she protested during both medal ceremonies by quietly turning <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> and away during the playing of the Soviet national anthem.|$|E

60|$|The {{supposed}} child kept <b>her</b> <b>head</b> drooped <b>down,</b> {{and kept}} her form close at Maggy's side.|$|R
25|$|Crisólogo and Legasto {{began the}} novena, {{and on the}} third and fourth day, Legasto {{reported}} that she experienced a very strange feeling. This sensation, she said, was as though something heavy was moving from the top of <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> through her body before leaving her. Her health then gradually improved to the point that she travelled to the United States for further treatment. Before she left, she had a checkup; no pleurisy was found but the doctors found a benign tumor. She reported that she still felt some pain; despite the discomfort, she considers the pains she suffers as a blessing, an offering to our Lord in atonement for her sins.|$|E
500|$|They wrote, [...] "There was one lift {{that was}} truly {{spectacular}} – Frank {{would pick up}} Yolanda, spin her with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> then throw her out where she landed on one knee in a low lunge, back leg extended. They never did any thing acrobatic, but this lift was spectacular." ...|$|E
500|$|I went to New York to meet (Madonna), begrudgingly, {{and showed}} up at an address at SoHo, {{which turned out to}} be a squat basically. Madonna was scantily clad, working out to a massive disco track. She was charismatic. She kept putting <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> on the table and talking to me, very flirtatious, and that gave me the idea for the scene in [...] "burning up", where her face is on the road, and the camera's really low and close.|$|E
60|$|She turned <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> glanced <b>down,</b> waved <b>her</b> hand {{to someone}} on the terrace below, and stood up.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she went}} in to breakfast and sat toying with her food, keeping <b>her</b> <b>head</b> bent <b>down,</b> <b>her</b> face hidden.|$|R

500|$|After Nancy Reagan {{accepted}} the flag, {{she approached the}} casket and spent several minutes patting and stroking it. She laid <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> on the casket, before breaking down and crying; The Washington Post described Nancy as having been [...] "stoic through nearly a week of somber rituals" [...] but she [...] "surrendered to her grief after being handed the flag that had covered her husband's coffin." [...] While she cried, she kissed the casket and said [...] "I love you". Her children surrounded her, and attempted to console her. Nancy then walked away with her military escort, clutching the folded flag. The military band began to play the Victorian hymn [...] "My Faith Looks Up to Thee" [...] as the Reagan children said their goodbyes. Funeral attendees {{had an opportunity to}} file past the coffin.|$|E
500|$|More than a {{thousand}} young actresses were considered for the part of Max. Cameron started reviewing audition tapes when the field had been narrowed down to twenty or thirty applicants. He was initially not impressed with Alba's audition tape, saying [...] "she had <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> she was reading out of the script... she didn't present herself all that well. But {{there was something about}} the way she read the script that copped an attitude that I liked." [...] Cameron continually reviewed the audition tapes but kept coming back to Alba's, eventually deciding that he needed to meet her. Alba was hired for the role before the script was written. Eglee said: [...] "We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backwards, we were writing for this actress, with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang." [...] To train for the role, Alba spent a year doing martial arts and gymnastics and riding motorcycles.|$|E
2500|$|Ester Percivati, a young Turkish woman, {{recalled}} guards {{calling her}} a whore {{as she was}} marched to the toilet, where a woman officer forced <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> into the bowl and a male jeered [...] "Nice arse! Would you like a truncheon up it?" [...] Several women reported threats of rape. Finally, the police forced their captives to sign statements, waiving all their legal rights. One man, David Larroquelle, testified that he refused to sign the statements. Police broke three of his ribs for his disobedience.|$|E
60|$|He {{stood before}} <b>her,</b> with his <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> and sighed bitterly.|$|R
60|$|She {{was not at}} work; she was not pausing over it. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> hung <b>down</b> over <b>her</b> breast; {{her hands}} and arms lay {{helpless}} on the desk.|$|R

2500|$|Prior to her trial, Siddiqui {{said she}} was {{innocent}} of all charges. She maintained she could prove she was innocent but refused {{to do so in}} court. On 11 January 2010, Siddiqui told the judge that she would not co-operate with her attorneys and wanted to fire them. She said she did not trust the judge and added, [...] "I'm boycotting the trial, just to let all of you know. There's too many injustices." [...] She then put <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> on the defence table as the prosecution proceeded.|$|E
2500|$|In 1800, the Duchess {{prepared}} Little G for her {{presentation at}} court. The task was difficult; débutantes {{were expected to}} display grace and dignity or face the ruin of their first London season. However, young Georgiana had not inherited her mother's poise and ease of movement, and tended to keep <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>down.</b> Her court dress, complemented with the Cavendish diamonds, was considered a dramatic success [...] Soon after, she came out in society during a ball held in her honour. Lady Holland observed Georgiana and described her as [...] "a most charming girl–sensible, pleasing, full of information and totally without a particle of affectation, and if she bestows herself upon a man equal to her situation, I have no doubt she will make a most delightful wife".|$|E
60|$|She laid <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> beside {{mine for}} a moment and then she kissed my hand.|$|E

60|$|MARGARET. Shut up, Daddy. (She waggles <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and <b>down</b> comes <b>her</b> hair.) Daddy, I {{know what}} you are {{thinking}} of. You are thinking what a handful she is going to be.|$|R

60|$|Mary Erskine shook <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{but did not}} reply. She seemed, however, to be regaining her composure.

60|$|With <b>her</b> <b>head</b> bowed <b>down,</b> cowering like a sulky animal, {{she looked}} at him under her brows. He stared {{fiercely}} back at her, but beneath her steady, glowering gaze he shrank, then turned aside.|$|R
60|$|Nanina's hands {{dropped on}} the priest's knees. She bent <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> on them, and began to weep bitterly.|$|E
60|$|Then he laid <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>down</b> {{again on}} the pillow and, {{kneeling}} beside her, held her hand in his.|$|E
60|$|Phoebe trembled, {{and said}} nothing. She sat with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>down,</b> and her hands, fast clasped together, {{resting on her}} lap.|$|E
