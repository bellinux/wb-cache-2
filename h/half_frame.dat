2500|$|Lenses with {{apertures}} opening 2.8 or wider {{are referred}} to as [...] "fast" [...] lenses, although the specific point has changed over time (for example, in the early 20th century aperture openings wider than 6 were considered fast). The fastest lenses for the common 35 mm film format in general production have apertures of 1.2 or 1.4, with more at 1.8 and 2.0, and many at 2.8 or slower; 1.0 is unusual, though sees some use. When comparing [...] "fast" [...] lenses, the image format used must be considered. Lenses designed for a small format such as <b>half</b> <b>frame</b> or APS-C need to project a much smaller image circle than a lens used for large format photography. Thus the optical elements built into the lens can be far smaller and cheaper.|$|E

50|$|Maitani joined Olympus in 1956 {{and worked}} for them for 40 years. He was {{involved}} with the design {{of many of the}} company's most well-known cameras, including the Pen and the Pen F <b>half</b> <b>frame</b> cameras, the OM System, the XA and later the Stylus.|$|E
50|$|Another {{process called}} Techniscope was {{developed}} by Technicolor Inc. in the early 1960s, using normal 35 mm cameras modified for two perforations per (<b>half)</b> <b>frame</b> instead of the regular four and later converted into an anamorphic print. Techniscope was mostly used in Europe, especially with low-budget films.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s cameras {{came out}} that were {{intended}} to make stereo pairs, specifically designed to use print film, producing a <b>half</b> <b>frame</b> format that could be viewed using freevision or the included print viewer, directly as {{it came from a}} standard processing lab. The original Loreo was the pioneer, but it was followed by several other cameras, including some designed to take macro shots.|$|E

40|$|The use of hexapod {{circular}} external fixators has simplified {{the ability}} to correct complex limb deformities without cumbersome frame reconfigurations. These frames are applied primarily using half pin mountings and {{may be difficult to}} utilize given the constraints of traditional half pin constructs. We compared the biomechanical performance of simplified divergent <b>half</b> pin <b>frames</b> to mountings currently being utilized for application of hexapod frames. Three 6 -mm half pins per limb segment were placed into sawbones at 60 ° divergent angles in both the sagittal and coronal planes in a 2 -cm diaphyseal fracture gap model. Pin mountings were attached to a standardized four-ring construct. This was compared to similar four-ring frames with two differing pin/wire configurations: (1) two tensioned wires per ring placed at 90 ° angles, a total eight wires; and (2) two 5 -mm half pins per ring placed at 90 ° angles, a total eight half pins. The divergent 6 -mm <b>half</b> pin <b>frames</b> demonstrated similar performance compared the standardized tensioned wire and 5 -mm <b>half</b> pin <b>frames</b> in terms of axial micromotion and angular deflection. Based on the mechanical performance of these divergent <b>half</b> pin <b>frames</b> we believe they can be used clinically without detrimental consequences...|$|R

50|$|<b>Half</b> <b>frame</b> {{meant that}} the camera used an 18&times;24 mm {{vertical}} (portrait) format, producing twice the pictures on a roll of 135 film as the regular 36&times;24 mm format. The smaller image format also allowed for a smaller camera and lenses, making the Pen F system {{one of the smallest}} SLR systems ever made; the Pentax Auto 110 was smaller, but with a much more limited range of lenses and accessories, and smaller 110 film.|$|E
50|$|A Phase Alternating Line (PAL)-based {{television}} set display, for example, scans 50 fields every second (25 odd and 25 even). The {{two sets of}} 25 fields work {{together to create a}} full frame every 1/25 of a second (or 25 frames per second), but with interlacing create a new <b>half</b> <b>frame</b> every 1/50 of a second (or 50 fields per second). To display interlaced video on progressive scan displays, playback applies deinterlacing to the video signal (which adds input lag).|$|E
5000|$|Another {{supporting}} structure at Corotoman {{was known as}} the [...] "Spinster's House." [...] The house was constructed in either the late 17th century or the early 18th century. The [...] "Spinster's House" [...] was a one-story and a <b>half</b> <b>frame</b> house adorned with a gabled roof with large end chimneys. It lay in ruins for years before finally disappearing around 1930. Before its disappearance, the [...] "Spinster's House" [...] was the last remaining {{supporting structure}} of the original Corotoman plantation.|$|E
50|$|For {{playback}} and view-through purposes, circuits read {{image data}} from either a recorded cassette or the CCD and fill <b>half</b> a digital <b>frame</b> store at the PXL reduced rate, while scanning other <b>half</b> of the <b>frame</b> store at normal NTSC rates. Since each <b>half</b> of the <b>frame</b> store includes only 10800 pixels in its 120 by 90 array, {{the same as}} the CCD, the display resolution was deemed to be marginal, and black borders were added around the picture, squashing the framestore image content {{into the middle of the}} frame, preserving pixels which would otherwise be lost in overscan. An anti-aliasing low-pass filter is included in the final video output circuit.|$|R

25|$|The vessel {{contained}} framing {{composed of}} various elements (keel, fore foot, stempost, cutwater, sternpost, inner post, false post), double planking (assembled entirely by mortise-and-tenon joints pegged from the inside) and {{was covered with}} a sheet of lead. What is referred to as a large keelson is actually a 7.5m long mast-step timber made of oak which doubles the axial frame. The stringers, nailed onto the frames, reinforced the hull longitudinally. Regularly alternated floor timbers and <b>half</b> <b>frames</b> comprised the framing of the vessel. The wreck indicates the vessel was about 40m long (35.10m remains preserved on the seabed), 9m wide, and 4.5m deep with a length-to-beam coefficient of 4.4(if L=40m, L/W=4.4). This coefficient of elongation-rate of length to width allows the ship to be much faster than those with a lower coefficient.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{somewhat}} [...] "retro" [...] development, many stereo photography buffs used the Nimslo to take stereo slides which were mounted in [...] "4P" [...] (<b>half</b> <b>frame)</b> slide mounts. This {{was done by}} using either slip in cardboard mounts, some specially labeled with the Nimslo name or aluminum masks such as the Realist [...] "closeup" [...] mask. These masks were sometimes put in metal frames and placed between glass, much like Realist format slides. The resulting stereo slides could then be viewed using conventional Realist format viewers or even projected with stereo projectors.|$|E
50|$|Semicircular rotary {{shutters}} {{also have}} the advantage of unlimited X-sync speed, but all rotary FP shutters have the disadvantage of the bulk required for the plate spin. The Univex Mercury (1938, USA) <b>half</b> <b>frame</b> 35 mm camera had a very large dome protruding out the top of the main body to accommodate its 1/1000 s rotary shutter. They also produce very unusual distortion at very high speed because of the angular sweep of the exposure wipe. Bulk can be reduced by substituting blade sheaves for the plate, but then the rotary FP shutter essentially becomes a regular bladed FP shutter.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} the camera is {{reminiscent}} of the Olympus Pen <b>half</b> <b>frame</b> film cameras and is marketed as the Olympus digital PEN. The model presented on 16 June 2009 was very similar in looks to the Olympus Pen F. Initially, two micro 4/3 lenses were available from Olympus, one 14-42 mm f/3.5-5.6 zoom and a 17 mm f/2.8 [...] pancake prime lens. Remarkably, {{with the exception of the}} optical viewfinder, the E-P1 seemed to fit most of the features found on the Olympus E-620, a larger Four Thirds system DSLR, into the small, compact MFT form factor.|$|E
50|$|Saturday Club is a {{historic}} women's club clubhouse located at Wayne, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. It was built in 1899, and is a 1 1/2-story, English <b>Half</b> Timber <b>frame</b> building. It measures approximately 55 feet by 75 feet, and has a gable roof with three gabled dormers. Its appearance is patterned after Shakespeare's Birthplace in Stratford-on-Avon, England.|$|R
50|$|The one <b>half</b> story <b>frame</b> {{house with}} a {{partially}} exposed cellar and interior end chimneys was constructed c.1835 on a site overlooking the Shawangunk Kill.

The center entry, framed by pilasters which support a full entablature, has three-paned sidelights.|$|R
50|$|Zecca had filmed {{himself in}} the strange contraption {{suspended}} from the studio roof with the camera having <b>half</b> the <b>frame</b> blocked. The film was then rewound and the Belleville, Paris city landscape {{was shot in the}} previously blacked-out portion, creating the first split-screen effect. The entire film only has a running time of approximately one minute.|$|R
50|$|Frames {{can be made}} to {{hold the}} lenses in several {{different}} ways. There are three common styles: full frame, <b>half</b> <b>frame,</b> and frameless. Full frame glasses have the frame go all around the lenses. Half frames go around only half the lens; typically the frames attach {{to the top of the}} lenses and on the side near the top. Frameless glasses have no frame around the lenses and the ear stems are attached directly to the lenses. There are two styles of frameless glasses: those that have a piece of frame material connecting the two lenses, and those that are a single lens with ear stems on each side.|$|E
50|$|The ZT 300 series {{tractors}} {{construction is}} based on a combination of the frameless block construction for the rear part and a <b>half</b> <b>frame</b> for the front. This makes the rear axle a rigid axle, while the front axle is a rigid swing axle. The ZT 300 has a three-point-linkage with a lifting force of 17,65 kN and a PTO as well as a hydraulic system. Starting in 1974, an optimised hydraulic system was used, that automatically increased the weight on the rear axle by slightly lifting the farm implement attached to the three-point linkage. This resulted in better traction and therefore greater drawbar pull force.|$|E
50|$|The Tessar was the {{standard}} high-quality, moderate-aperture, normal-perspective {{lens of the}} twentieth century. The Kodak Anastigmat Special 100mm f/3.5 on the Kodak Super Six-20 (1938, USA), the first autoexposure still camera, was a Tessar, as was the D. Zuiko 2.8 cm f/3.5 on the Olympus Pen (1959, Japan), the original Pen <b>half</b> <b>frame</b> camera; the Schneider S-Xenar 40mm f/3.5 on the late version of the Rollei 35 (1974, West Germany/Singapore); and the AF Nikkor D 45mm f/2.8P Special Edition for the Nikon FM3A (2001, Japan), the last manual focus 35mm SLR released by a major maker. It was fitting that the Zeiss Stiftung's last camera, the Zeiss Ikon S 312, had a Zeiss Tessar 40mm f/2.8 (1972, West Germany).|$|E
5000|$|Stend Station {{has been}} {{converted}} to a railway museum {{and is the only}} station building to remain in its original design. In the 1980s, the building had fallen into disrepair, but from 1987, Friends of the Os Line started renovating it. It has a small display of artifacts from the railway, including old pictures, a film and items, including tools from the workshop. Outside there is a 70 m long railway line. On it is a draisine from 1925, a combined third-class and post wagon from 1894. It consists of two <b>half</b> <b>frames</b> that were welded together, with bogies bought from Poland. It is the smallest bogies wagon in Norway. The station also features a water station. The museum also has a diesel locomotive which dates from 1967. It was used by Fana and later Bergen Municipality in the sewer tunnels, and was given to the museum in 1995. It features [...] gauge, but otherwise has no resemblance with the material used on the Nesttun-Os Line.|$|R
50|$|Jackson-Aitken Farm is a {{historic}} farm house, dairy barn and farm fields located at Andes in Delaware County, New York, United States. The farmhouse was built about 1850 and is a one and one <b>half</b> wood <b>frame</b> structure in a vernacular Greek Revival style. The barn is a large three story wooden building with a cross gabled banked entrance built in 1896. It features a distinctive cupola.|$|R
40|$|Interlacing is {{a widely}} used technique, for {{television}} broadcast and video recording, to double the perceived frame rate without increasing the bandwidth. But it presents annoying visual artifacts, such as flickering and silhouette "serration," during the playback. Existing state-of-the-art deinterlacing methods either ignore the temporal information to provide real-time performance but lower visual quality, or estimate the motion for better deinterlacing but with a trade-off of higher computational cost. In this paper, we present the first and novel deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) based method to deinterlace with high visual quality and real-time performance. Unlike existing models for super-resolution problems which relies on the translation-invariant assumption, our proposed DCNN model utilizes the temporal information from both the odd and even <b>half</b> <b>frames</b> to reconstruct only the missing scanlines, and retains the given odd and even scanlines for producing the full deinterlaced frames. By further introducing a layer-sharable architecture, our system can achieve real-time performance on a single GPU. Experiments shows that our method outperforms all existing methods, in terms of reconstruction accuracy and computational performance. Comment: 9 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
