50|$|The <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> was {{hydraulic}} tensioned and had {{a ratchet}} mechanism to keep the <b>chain</b> tight. The <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> rode on one pivoting chain guide resting on the ratchet tensioner and one fixed guide attached to the engine block and cylinder head. The 1991 to 1998 DOHC engine had an upper <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> <b>guide</b> in between the camshaft sprockets. The <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> was lubricated via cast-off {{from the top of}} the cylinder head and one 'squirter' on the oil pump housing. The SOHC and DOHC engines used different <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> sets.|$|R

50|$|The VH41DE {{also used}} a double row <b>timing</b> <b>chain,</b> {{compared}} to the VH45DE that used a single row <b>timing</b> <b>chain.</b> Its alternator is also located {{at the top of}} the engine which creates an overall narrower engine package which can be handy in engine conversions where it may otherwise foul on the chassis rails.|$|R
50|$|A <b>timing</b> <b>chain,</b> {{also called}} a sync chain, {{is used on}} tandem bicycles, to {{synchronize}} crank movement between the captain (front rider) and stoker (rear rider). As with auto engines, proper tension of the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> is necessary to prevent premature wear of the drivetrain components. Tension is adjusted {{by means of an}} eccentric bottom bracket.|$|R
50|$|To {{maintain}} the necessary {{tension on the}} <b>timing</b> <b>chain,</b> many tandems use an eccentric that {{is placed in the}} front rider's bottom bracket shell. An alternate solution is to implement a pulley, or idler, {{on the bottom of the}} <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> to take up slack. Idlers add friction and a potential point of failure to the drive train.|$|R

50|$|The {{second most}} popular solution, due to not {{requiring}} tandem-specific cranks is called single side rear drive. The forward crankset is {{connected by a}} right-side <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> to the rear crankset, {{which in turn is}} connected by a right-side chain to the rear wheel. This requires that one of the rear chainrings be devoted to the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> and limits shifting options.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] in {{the block}} {{in place of}} the {{camshaft}} was driven by the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> and drove the distributor and oil pump in conventional fashion. An additional sprocket on this shaft drove a second [...] "serpentine" [...] <b>timing</b> <b>chain,</b> 6 ft long, which drove both overhead camshafts. The length of this <b>chain</b> made precision <b>timing</b> of the camshafts an issue at high rpms.|$|R

50|$|Other {{changes to}} the engine were related to ease of {{manufacture}} and improved reliability. This led to elimination of coolant flowing through the intake manifold to prevent unnecessary heat transfer. To perform this change, {{the front of the}} engine block was extended to include provisions for the coolant to flow through a cross over in the block. This extension also acted as an integrated <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> housing. The <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> housing was covered with flat steel that was easier to seal than the typical large <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> cover used on other Ford V8s. These changes resulted in a bigger and heavier engine block than the Windsor V8s. The 351 Cleveland was not an all-new design, but a development of the 351W into a higher-performance variation.|$|R
50|$|A <b>timing</b> belt, <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> or cambelt {{is a part}} of an {{internal}} combustion engine that synchronizes the rotation of the crankshaft and the camshaft(s) so that the engine's valves open and close at the proper times during each cylinder's intake and exhaust strokes. In an interference engine the <b>timing</b> belt or <b>chain</b> is also critical to preventing the piston from striking the valves. A timing belt is usually a toothed belt -- a drive belt with teeth on the inside surface. A <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> is a roller chain.|$|R
50|$|Indicators {{that the}} <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> {{may need to}} be {{replaced}} include a rattling noise {{from the front of the}} engine.|$|R
50|$|The 116.960 {{engine was}} {{introduced}} in 1979 featuring 8.3:1 compression with 158 PS (116 kW; 155 hp) @ 4750rpm and 266 N·m (196 lb·ft) @ 2750rpm. This engine reached North America later for the 1981 380SL. There were 116.961, 116.962, and 116.963 versions of this engine. Early models came with a single row <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> until 1983 and were plagued with chain failure problems which Mercedes-Benz would repair free of charge, changing the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> to a dual row thus resolved the problem making these engine as durable and reliable as any other Mercedes V8. All 1984+ models came with a double row <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> from the factory to prevent this failure, however this engine was replaced for the 1986 model year by its larger 4.2 litre variant.|$|R
50|$|BMW {{engineers}} used a 4-valve {{head and}} a single-row <b>timing</b> <b>chain.</b> Kugelfischer fuel injection was used with individual throttle valves and the distinctive six inlet pipes.|$|R
50|$|The S38B35 {{was based}} on the M88/3, but with changes {{including}} a dual-row <b>timing</b> <b>chain,</b> camshaft, compression ratio lowered to 9.8:1 and fitted with a catalytic converter.|$|R
50|$|The 223 was a side-valve engine, {{and used}} a <b>timing</b> <b>chain.</b> The 223 CID L straight-6 was used in Pontiac {{automobiles}} (1937-40) and GMC trucks (1938 only).|$|R

50|$|Designated EGA, the 3.3 {{was built}} at Trenton Engine in Trenton, Michigan. It uses SFI fuel injection, has roller tappets and {{features}} forged steel connecting rods, a one-piece cast camshaft, and either a cast aluminum or reinforced plastic intake manifold. The 3.3 has a <b>timing</b> <b>chain,</b> {{and is an}} interference engine meaning that the valves will collide with the pistons {{in the event of}} a <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> failure. Unlike the 3.5 on which the water pump is driven by the timing belt, on the 3.3, the accessory belt drives the water pump.|$|R

50|$|The Hyundai Lambda {{engine family}} is the company's modern all-aluminum V6. It is {{manufactured}} at Hyundai's HMMA plant in Montgomery, Alabama, United States. All versions of this engine use a <b>timing</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Early {{models of}} the M42 {{experienced}} failures of a profile gasket sealing the lower cam chain case to {{the underside of the}} cylinder head. [...] This gasket seals the primary coolant passage within the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> case. A significant failure would thus discharge pressurized steam and hot coolant into the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> case. In many cases this coolant rapidly contaminates the motor oil in the sump, causing main bearing failure. BMW updated the profile gasket material and instituted a program to repair motors under warranty. In extreme cases, the aluminum mating surfaces in the head and chain case would corrode.|$|R
50|$|The team's 1985 season {{started off}} in January with the Wellington 500 and Pukekohe 500 races in New Zealand where Brock and Perkins failed to {{figure in the}} results their {{under-developed}} Group A Commodore. Despite only one win during the 1985 season in the cars Australian debut which saw Brock win Round 2 of the 1985 ATCC at Sandown (the team missed the opening round at Winton as the car was still in transit from NZ), Brock nearly pulled off an upset podium at Bathurst, retiring due to a broken <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> three laps {{from the end of}} the race while running a strong second behind the much more powerful, V12 Jaguar XJS, driven by 1974 Bathurst winner John Goss and German Armin Hahne entered by European Touring Car Championship winners Tom Walkinshaw Racing (TWR). The single-row <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> had been shown up throughout the year as a weak point of the Commodore's, something which would not cause a problem with the upgraded 1986 car which would have the more durable double-row <b>timing</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|R
50|$|For the UAZ-3159 'BARS' a new {{range of}} 16-valve ZMZ-406 engine {{has been used}} with {{electronic}} controlled fuel injection. The engine design comprises cast iron cylinder block, two camshafts in the engine head and <b>timing</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|R
50|$|For the 1992 model year, the 4.3L had its {{block design}} {{modified}} {{to allow a}} balance shaft to be installed. Even though the 4.3L is an even fire V6, the 90-degree block layout is not ideal for smoothness. The balance shaft on the 4.3L is installed above the top timing gear, and runs through {{the top of the}} lifter valley. It is gear driven off the <b>timing</b> <b>chain,</b> and therefore a new <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> cover was designed for these balanced 4.3L V6s. Balance shaft engines do not have provisions for a mechanical fuel pump unlike the non-balance shaft motors which retained the cast in boss.|$|R
5000|$|The SOHC {{version was}} {{introduced}} in 1997 in the Ford Explorer, alongside the original pushrod version. It features a variable length intake manifold and produces [...] and 254 lbft Nmf. It uses a jackshaft {{in place of a}} camshaft to drive a <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> to each cylinder head. Three <b>timing</b> <b>chains</b> are used, one from the crank to the jackshaft, one {{in the front of the}} engine to drive the cam for the left bank, and one on the back of the engine to drive the cam for the right bank. Ford has since phased out the engine in favor of the more powerful and efficient Duratec 37.|$|R
5000|$|Compared {{with the}} M40, the M42 {{features}} a DOHC valvetrain, a <b>timing</b> <b>chain,</b> hydraulic valve lifters {{and an increased}} 10:1 compression ratio. Later versions of the M42 also feature a dual length intake manifold (called [...] "DISA").|$|R
5000|$|Compared {{with its}} M40 predecessor, it {{features}} a dual length intake manifold (called [...] "DISA" [...] by BMW) to provide torque across a wider rev range, knock sensing and a <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> (instead of the M40's timing belt).|$|R
