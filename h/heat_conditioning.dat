40|$|Abstract: The {{beneficial}} effect of raising ambient temperature at early age, some feeding programs and their combination in improving productivity of broiler chicks under summer season stress conditions was examined. A total of 144 one-day-old commercial broiler chicks {{were used in}} the present study. They were divided into two groups of 72 birds each. The first group was subjected to 38 °C ± 1 ° for 24 hrs at day 5 post-hatching (<b>heat</b> <b>conditioning</b> group, H. C) while the second group was kept as a control (non <b>heat</b> <b>conditioning</b> group, N. H. C). At day 7 birds were individually weighed, wing banded and then divided into four sub groups with approximately similar initial body weight. The sub groups were 1 - qualitative (70 %) feed restriction (F. R) on days 7, 8 and 9 post-hatching, 2 - feed withdrawal (F. W. D) for 24 hrs on day 9, 3 - supplemental vitamin C (Vit. C) from 21 to 42 day of age and then 4 -the control group. Results indicate that average body weight, weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio were significantly affected at 42 days old. It is concluded from the present results that subjecting broiler chicks to early age <b>heat</b> <b>conditioning</b> at 5 days old or using some feeding programs (F. R, F. W. D and Vit.

Two of these CHO sublines are characterized by an increased heat sensitivity and impaired cellular capacity for thermotolerance development. The data show that thermotolerance development after heat condition-ing in the heat-sensitive, thermotolerance-deficient mutants was accompanied by reduced labeling of a Ai,. 50 000 glycoprotein (GP 50), in both soluble and insoluble cell fractions. Similarly, activation of UDP-JV-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (Gal-NAcT) after hyperthermia was almost completely abolished in these cell lines. Both of these endpoints have been correlated previously with thermotoler-ance expression. The data are consistent with the glycosylation hypothesis that attributes increased heat resistance of thermotolerant cells, at least in part, to enhanced glycosylation and accumulation of endogenous glycoproteins, such as GP 50.

The mechanical performance of rovings and single fibres of well-defined silane sized and water sized E-glass fibre samples was investigated at room temperature after thermal conditioning at temperatures up to 400 °C. Thermal conditioning for 15 minutes led to strength degradation of greater than 50 % at higher temperatures. The tensile strength of silane coated fibres was relatively stable up to 300 °C but exhibited a precipitous drop at higher conditioning temperatures. The water sized fibres exhibited an approximately linear decrease in strength with increasing conditioning temperature. The strength distribution of the water sized fibres could be well represented by a unimodal three parameter Weibull distribution.

The epigenome is therefore an essential contributor to phenotypic plasticity, and learning how environmental exposures translate into persisting epigenetic changes may open new doors to improve robustness and resilience of developing animals. Birds are agronomic species of choice to directly manipulate the embryonic environment and study its consequences on the developing animal. We previously showed that the heat tolerance of male commercial chickens was improved by cyclically elevating the egg incubation temperature. This treatment named embryonic <b>heat</b> <b>conditioning</b> (HC) was associated with changes in gene expression that persisted during the development of chickens and enhanced gene expression response in case of heat challenge at slaughter age, 35 days post-hatch. To further explore the molecular basis of heat acclimation, we took advantage of an inbred line of japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) to investigate the impact of HC on bird methylome.

We performed a characterization of HC on quail phenotype in interaction with a post-hatch heat stress at the onset of sexual maturity. Several parameters such as weight of the animals, temperature, egg laying for females, hormone levels and blood gas characteristics were measured.

40|$|In {{commercial}} poultry husbandry practice, the hatchery {{takes over the}} incubation of bird eggs {{in order to provide}} as many day-old chicks as needed at any time to farmers. The main bottleneck for poultry industry development in Togo is the lack of day-old chick supply. Indeed, there is no proficient hatchery which can cover the needs of the farmers because of lack of information about hatchery management or people trained as hatchery managers. Also, there is lack of information about management practice aspects, etc. With the aim to promote poultry industry in Togo, an interuniversity project [Catholic University of Leuven (KUL) and University of Lome (UL) ] as a model of poultry industry development was implemented.

40|$|The {{needs for}} food {{with a growing}} world {{population}} have increased genetic selection for a more efficient bird, affecting parameters such as resistant to diseases and/or heat stress.

Different approaches {{have been used to}} increase thermotolerance in layers and broilers such as <b>heat</b> <b>conditioning,</b> manipulation of diet composition and feed deprivation, but usually these adjustments are not easy to apply and tend to require trained personnel. In this research a series of studies was done to evaluate productive, physiological and metabolic parameters, and the effect of addition of excess dietary vitamin D 3 as a management adjustment in three varieties of laying hens (Hy-Line® Browns, W 98, and W 36) exposed to HS. In general, the three strains responded in the same manner to HS (thermal panting, respiratory alkalosis, increase in fat metabolism, reduction of feed intake, intestinal calcium uptake (CaT), egg production (EP), reproductive hormone levels, and increase in liver expression of heat shock protein- 70), but there were differences in the degree of the response being elucidated. The W 36 s were more resistant to HS in term of survivability, but PP were highly affected in this strain. The W 36 s expressed the highest rate of CaT, but calcium utilization (CaU) was greatly affected with a reduction in eggshell quality (EQ). Brown birds expressed the worst performance in survivability and PP during HS. W 98 birds showed an intermediate mortality rate but expressed along with the W 36 s the highest PP during HS. However, the W 98 s showed the least reduction in EQ during HS. Vitamin D 3 during HS was able to improved survivability, EP and CaT; however, CaU was not improved, as was noted by a poor EQ in white birds.

40|$|Promyelocytic Leukaemia {{proteins}} (PML), {{the core}} component of PML nuclear bodies (NB), are implicated in many critical cellular functions. One {{of those is}} confronting virus infection: DNA and RNA viruses target PML-NB and interact with PML proteins and this is thought to facilitate efficient replication by interfering with their antiviral functions. One of those viruses is human adenovirus type 5 (Ad 5). Its early E 4 Orf 3 protein interacts specifically with PML isoform II (PML-II), disrupting PML-NB into track-like structures to inhibit PML- antiviral responses. PML-II {{has been shown to}} be a positive regulator of type I interferon responses, as are typically induced by virus infection, through regulating the transcription factors that control this innate immune response. Given this role of PML-II and its interaction with Ad 5 E 4 Orf 3, the first question that addressed here is how does PML-II affect the progress of Ad 5 infection under normal conditions? PML-NBs are also involved in cellular stress responses, being disrupted by heat shock and other stresses. Thermo-tolerance due to mild <b>heat</b> <b>conditioning</b> protects cells from more aggressive stresses such as higher temperatures through triggering the heat shock response, which helps in re-folding the affected cellular proteins. Interferon and other cellular cytokines are also induced in response to heat shock, suggesting a mechanism whereby heat stress might affect infection, possibly dependent on PML-NBs. The second question addressed here was whether cells became more resistant to infection by pre- stressing them and if so would PML-II have a role in that resistance? To address these questions, PML-II-depleted cells were first engineered by lentiviral vector delivery of specific shRNA. Physical and functional knock-down was confirmed by measuring mRNA levels for PML-II and for genes normally induced by NF-kB activation. The biology of Ad 5 infection in these cells was then assessed in comparison with control cells. Ad 5 gene expression displayed substantial increases with the transient or permanent depletion of PML-II in HeLa and MRC 5 cells. This effect was particularly marked for late gene expression; hexon mRNA and all other late proteins showed substantial increase in PML-II depleted cells compared to several distinct control cell lines.

40|$|Previously, we {{reported}} that thermal conditioning at 39 degreesC on days 13 - 17 of incubation of broiler eggs enabled thermotolerance during post-hatch growth (J. Therm. Biol. 28 (2003) 133). Tolerance to {{a temperature of}} 30 degreesC was accompanied by changes in thyroid hormones and metabolic parameters. In the current study, we determined the mechanism of epigenetic heat adaptation during embryonic age by measuring blood physiological parameters that {{may be associated with}} the ultimate effects of thermal conditioning. Hatching eggs from Ross breeders were subjected to heat treatment of 39 degreesC at days 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 of incubation for 2 h per day. Control eggs were incubated at 37. 6 degreesC. Samples of eggs were withdrawn on each day of thermal conditioning and at internal pipping (IP) to obtain blood samples from embryos. The remaining eggs were weighed at day 18 and transferred to hatchers. The timing of IP, external pipping (EP) and hatching were monitored every 2 h. At hatch, chicks were weighed and hatchability was determined. Blood samples were obtained from samples of day-old chicks. T 3, T 4, corticosterone, pCO(2), pO(2) levels were determined in the blood. Blood pH was measured and T 3 /T 4 ratios were calculated. <b>Heat</b> <b>conditioning</b> significantly increased corticosterone and pO(2) levels and blood pH but depressed pCO(2) at day 14. These were followed by a significant depression of T 4 level on day 15. Remarkably, at day 16, all these parameters were back to normal as in the control embryos. Hatching was delayed by thermal conditioning probably {{as a result of the}} depressed corticosterone levels at IP. Hatchability was also lower in the heat-treated group but 1 -day old chick weights were comparable to those of the controls. The result suggests that epigenetic thermal conditioning involves changes in these physiological parameters and probably serve as a method for epigenetic temperature adaptation since the same mechanisms are employed for coping with heat during post-embryonic growth. It also suggests that days 14 - 15 may be the optimal and most sensitive timing for evoking this mechanism during embryonic development. The adverse effects of heat treatment observed in this study may have been due to the continued exposure to heat until day 17. Fine-tuning thermal conditioning to days 14 - 15 only may improve these production parameters. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test the effect of pre- and post-hatch temperature conditioning or a combination of both, on the acquisition of heat tolerance during the adult life of broiler chickens. Nine hundred hatching eggs produced by Cobb broiler breeders were incubated at standard incubation conditions until d 16. Half of the eggs were subjected to temperature conditioning for 3 h/day (39. 5 degrees C, 65 % relative humidity (RH)) at d 16, 17 and 18 of incubation (T group) while the other half Control group (C group) were kept at standard incubation conditions. From the end of d 18 until end of incubation, embryo heat production (HP), gas partial pressure in the air chamber at IP, and blood parameters (T- 3 and corticosterone) were measured. Also, hatching time for individual chick, body temperature (Tb) and body weight (BW) and the number of hatched chicks were recorded. Hatched chicks were raised under regular conditions. At the age of 3 d, the chicks of each incubation condition group were divided into 2 groups: half of the chicks of each group (C and T) were subjected to thermal conditioning (41. 0 degrees C for 6 hours). The other half of the chicks was used as control. The 4 groups of broilers were reared until 42 d of age. During post-hatch period, Tb, blood parameters and BW were again measured. At 42 d all broilers were heat challenged at 35 degrees C for 6 h. After heat challenge, mortality was recorded and blood samples were collected. The results indicate that thermal conditioning during incubation had no effect on hatchability of eggs but prolonged incubation duration, decreased T 3 (at IP), corticosterone (at IP and hatch), HP and Tb. Overall, at 3 d post-hatch, prenatal condition increased while post-natal conditioning decreased corticosterone levels. Heat challenge at 42 d post-hatch decreased T 3 levels in the TC group and increased corticosterone levels in postnatally conditioned group. Differences between BW become obvious from 28 d post-hatch and were in the following order: TT > CC = CT > TC. At 42, the highest BW was obtained in the broilers of TC group. <b>Heat</b> <b>conditioning</b> at 3 d of age improved heat tolerance in response to heat challenge at 42 d. post-hatch whereas prenatal treatment had a strong negative effect.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of end-of-life composite products in an environmentally friendly manner {{is one of}} the most important challenges facing the industry and community. In this presentation we will introduce two recently initiated EPSRC funded projects focussed on the cost effective recycling of end-of-life glass fibre composites from automotive and wind energy applications. The ultimate goal of these projects is to enable cost-effective regeneration of the mechanical properties of glass fibres which have been produced from thermal recycling of glass reinforced structural composites. This project has the potential to totally transform the economics of recycling GRP composites which would otherwise most likely be disposed of to landfill. A breakthrough in this field will enable such recycled fibres to compete with pristine materials in many large volume composite applications. The development of an economically viable process for regenerating the properties of thermally recycled glass fibres would have major technological, societal, economic, environmental impacts. Conservative estimates indicate that there is a potential to generate a global industry with an annual production of 1 million Tons of reusable regenerated glass fibres with a market value order of magnitude of £ 1, 000 M. The reuse of these materials could result in a huge reduction in the environmental impact of the glass-fibre industry where the replacement of pristine glass fibre products would equate to a global reduction in CO 2 production of 400, 000 Tons/annum from reduced melting energy requirements alone. Furthermore, such a technological development would also reduce the need for an annual landfill {{disposal of}} 2 million Tons of composite materials. These developments would clearly be in line with the growing societal and environmental pressure to reduce the use of landfill disposal, increase the reuse of valuable raw materials resources, and reduce the release of CO 2 to the atmosphere. The results of a study of the properties of glass fibres after thermal conditioning will be presented. The mechanical performance of rovings and single fibres of well-defined silane sized and unsized E-glass fibre samples was investigated at room temperature after thermal conditioning at temperatures up to 600 °C. Thermal conditioning for only 15 minutes led to strength degradation of greater than 80 % at higher temperatures. The room temperature strength of silane coated fibres was relatively stable up to 300 °C but exhibited a precipitous drop at higher conditioning temperatures. Unsized fibres exhibited an approximately linear decrease in strength with increasing conditioning temperature.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{reports on}} the results of a {{selection}} experiment using Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) with the aim of assessing the impact of a number of selection regimes on tolerance to heat stress as measured by growth rate. Four lines were selected for six generations for increased weight gain from 14 - 28 days of age under either high (W, 32 ºC) or normal (C, 25 ºC) temperature conditions on either a high (H, 250 g/kg) or low (L, 150 g/kg) protein diet. Both diets contained 13. 0 MJ ME/kg. The four selected lines were thus designated WH, CH, WL and CL. Fortnightly hatches were produced each generation from matings between 12 males and 36 females per line, with the parents of the next generation selected from approximately 100 birds per sex per line. A randomly selected control line (line C) of similar size was also maintained and reared in all cages with the selected line birds. Each generation, a third hatch of birds was reared and approximately 20 birds per line per environment were placed in single-bird cages to measure correlated responses in weight gain and feed efficiency in all four temperature/ dietary protein environments. In addition, correlated responses were measured in body composition and an assessment of the relative responses of the lines to early post-hatch epigenetic <b>heat</b> <b>conditioning</b> and to dietary addition of betaine (an osmolyte) were undertaken. The final study involved measurement of correlated response in the lines in the components of reproductive performance. On the high protein diet, response in growth rate relative to the control line in all selected lines was positive under both temperature environments, and by generations 5 and 6 growth rate was higher in the WH than in the CH line birds in both temperature environments. As weight gain was the selection criterion, these results suggest that selection for increased growth rate under high temperature conditions may not only be beneficial for progeny reared under high temperature conditions, but might also be at least as effective as selection under normal temperatures for progeny reared under normal temperature conditions. Whilst there was no equivalent advantage in feed efficiency in the WH line birds in either temperature environment, and the results arise from a comparison between un-replicated lines, they certainly indicate that such a selection approach is unlikely to have deleterious consequences. There was no benefit in either growth rate or feed efficiency under either temperature environments achieved through selection of birds on a low protein diet, irrespective of the selection temperature conditions. This indicates that irrespective of environmental temperature either during selection or subsequently, any possible advantage obtained through a reduction in the protein breakdown rate conferred through selection on a diet limiting in protein is outweighed by other factors contributing to a lower heritability and poorer response in these lines. In contrast to the WH line, the CH line birds in the normal temperature conditions were significantly (...|$|E
