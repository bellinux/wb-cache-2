25|$|During the {{fighting}} to secure Guantánamo Bay harbor in Cuba, the light {{weight of the}} 6mm Lee Navy cartridge enabled individual Marines to carry extra ammunition without an undue weight penalty, an advantage when pursuing an enemy over mountainous and difficult ground. The extra cartridges proved useful when <b>early</b> ammunition <b>resupply</b> from Navy ships was disrupted {{at the outset of}} the Guantanamo operation, allowing Marines to continue their assault even while individually resupplying Cuban rebels who had run short of ammunition.|$|R
50|$|Frowd {{was in the}} Caribbean in his 8-gun 60-man {{brigantine}} alongside Englishman William Moody’s 36-gun 130-man Rising Sun {{and another}} ship in 1718. There they captured several ships near St. Christopher’s, looting some and burning others, continuing through <b>early</b> 1719 after <b>resupplying</b> at St. Thomas in December. Their aggression prompted Governor Hamilton to request assignment of a warship from England for protection. Frowd acted as a ship’s tender to Moody’s Rising Sun but also took ships on his own, including a pink from Belfast near the Carolinas in January 1719.|$|R
40|$|SummarySteroid hormones are {{systemic}} signaling {{molecules that}} regulate juvenile-adult transitions in both insects and mammals. In insects, pulses of the steroid hormone 20 -hydroxyecdysone (20 E) are generated by increased biosynthesis followed by inactivation/clearance. Although mechanisms that control 20 E synthesis have received considerable recent attention, the physiological significance of 20 E inactivation remains largely unknown. We {{show that the}} cytochrome P 450 Cyp 18 a 1 lowers 20 E titer during the Drosophila prepupal to pupal transition. Furthermore, this reduction of 20 E levels is a prerequisite to induce βFTZ-F 1, {{a key factor in}} the genetic hierarchy that controls <b>early</b> metamorphosis. <b>Resupplying</b> βFTZ-F 1 rescues Cyp 18 a 1 -deficient prepupae. Because Cyp 18 a 1 is 20 E-inducible, it appears that the increased production of steroid is responsible for its eventual decline, thereby generating the regulatory pulse required for proper temporal progression of metamorphosis. The coupling of hormone clearance to βFTZ-F 1 expression suggests a general mechanism by which transient signaling drives unidirectional progression through a multistep process...|$|R
50|$|In <b>early</b> November, Komet <b>resupplied</b> and refueled in Japan, was {{disguised}} as the Japanese merchantman Manio Maru. She operated with the Orion, {{disguised as}} Mayebashi Maru and the supply ship Kulmerland, posing as the Tokio Maru. During December, Komet and Orion sank five Allied merchant ships, {{with a combined}} tonnage of about 41,000 tons, that had been waiting off the island of Nauru to load phosphate (of which Komet sank three). On 27 December 1940 she shelled the phosphate processing and loading facilities on Nauru. Cooperating with the Orion, she sank two more British ships in August 1941 and captured the Dutch 7,300 ton freighter Kota Nopan, which was sent as a prize to Bordeaux.|$|R
25|$|The {{first major}} combat {{use of the}} M1895 {{occurred}} during the land campaign to capture Guantánamo Bay, Cuba from June 9–14, 1898 with the First Marine Battalion, in particular at the battles of Camp McCalla and Cuzco Wells. During the battle of Cuzco Wells, Marines using the M1895 Lee effectively engaged concentrations of Spanish troops at ranges up to 1,200 yards, using volley fire against groups of enemy soldiers while their officers called out the range settings. Though some problems were noted with the new rifle, the flat ballistics, accuracy and rate of fire of the M1895 and the light weight of its 6mm ammunition proved to be of considerable benefit during offensive infantry operations over mountainous and jungled terrain against both Spanish regulars and loyalist guerrilla forces. The extra cartridges proved useful when <b>early</b> ammunition <b>resupply</b> from Navy ships was disrupted {{at the outset of}} the Guantanamo operation, allowing Marines to continue their assault even while individually resupplying Cuban rebels who had run short of ammunition. After the battle of Cuzco Wells, the surviving members of the retreating Spanish garrison informed the Spanish General Pareja at Ciudad Guantánamo that they had been attacked by 10,000 Americans.|$|R
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of April 1806, Strachan was the only British admiral still hunting for Willaumez's squadron, following the withdrawal of Duckworth and Warren. Strachan's squadron was hampered in its movements {{by the presence of}} the 98-gun , which was much too slow to operate effectively with Strachan's fast response force. Returning to Britain in <b>early</b> April to <b>resupply,</b> Strachan detached St George and [...] (the new flagship of the Rochefort blockade) at Plymouth and was joined by three additional ships of the line and two frigates, all fast ships capable of extended operations. In early May, news reached Britain of Willaumez's stay at Salvador and his subsequent departure in mid-April, and Strachan was again ordered in pursuit, sailing for the West Indies.|$|R
25|$|The {{culmination}} of the three-day Battle of Gettysburg was the massive infantry assault known as Pickett's Charge, in which the Confederate attack against {{the center of the}} Union line on Cemetery Ridge was repulsed with significant losses. The Confederates returned to their positions on Seminary Ridge and prepared to receive a counterattack. When the Union attack had not occurred by the evening of July 4, Lee realized that he could accomplish nothing more in his Gettysburg Campaign and that he had to return his battered army to Virginia. His ability to supply his army by living off the Pennsylvania countryside was now significantly reduced and the Union could easily bring up additional reinforcements as time passed, whereas he could not. Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton, Lee's artillery chief, reported to him that all of his long-range artillery ammunition had been expended and there were no <b>early</b> prospects for <b>resupply.</b> However, despite casualties of over 20,000 officers and men, including a number of senior officers, the morale of Lee's army remained high and their respect for the commanding general was not diminished by their reverses.|$|R
2500|$|C-46 Commandos {{also went}} back to war. A dozen surplus C-46's were {{purchased}} in the US covertly for use in Israel's 1948 war for independence and flown to Czechoslovakia in a circuitous route along South America and then across to Africa. [...] The type's long range proved invaluable flying cargo, including desperately needed dismantled S-199 fighters from Czechoslovakia {{as well as other}} weapons and military supplies. On the return flight the C-46's would dump bombs out the cargo door on various targets at night, including Gaza, El Arish, Majdal, and Faluja (Both Egypt and Israel would also use C-47's as bombers and transports locally). [...] C-46's served both Korea and Vietnam for various USAF operations, including resupply missions, paratroop drops, and clandestine agent transportation. The C-46 was not officially retired from service with the U.S. Air Force until 1968. The type also served under a U.S. civilian agency, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The C-46 played a supporting role in many clandestine operations during the late 1940s and <b>early</b> 1950s, including <b>resupply</b> efforts to Chiang Kai-Shek's troops battling Mao's Communists in China as well as flying cargoes of military and medical supplies to French forces via Gialam Airfield in Hanoi and other bases in French Indochina. The CIA operated its own [...] "airline" [...] for these operations, Civil Air Transport (CAT), which was eventually renamed Air America in 1959. An Air America C-46 was the last fixed-wing aircraft flown out of Vietnam [...] at the close of hostilities there. On 29 April 1975, Capt. E. G. Adams flew a 52-seat version, with 152 people on board, to Bangkok, Thailand. The C-46 was also employed in the abortive U.S.-supported Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. The Republic of China Air Force operated the C-46 up until 1982 at which time it was retired from service.|$|R
