40|$|The study {{performed}} in Phase 1 {{of this program}} applies only to a T 700 /CT 7 <b>engine</b> <b>family</b> <b>type</b> combustor functioning in the engine as defined and does not necessarily apply to other cycles or combustors of differing stoichiometry. The study was not extended {{to any of the}} fuel delivery accessories such as pumps or control systems, nor was there any investigation of potential systems problems which might arise as a consequence of abnormal properties such as density which might affect delivery schedules or aromatics content which might affect fuel system seals. The T 700 /CT 7 engine is a front drive turboshaft or turboprop engine in the 1500 - 1800 shp (1120 - 1340 kW) class as currently configured with highpower core flows of about 10 lb/sec (4. 5 kg/sec). It employs a straight-through annular combustion system less than 5 in. (12. 5 cm) in length utilizing a machined ring film cooled construction and twelve low-pressure air blast fuel injectors. Commercial and Naval versions employ two 0. 5 Joule capacitive discharge surface gap ignitors...|$|R

50|$|Inherent safety: Because a bell-type expander-cycle {{engine is}} thrust limited, it {{can easily be}} {{designed}} to withstand its maximum thrust conditions. In other <b>engine</b> <b>types,</b> a stuck fuel valve or similar problem can lead to engine thrust spiraling out of control due to unintended feedback systems. Other <b>engine</b> <b>types</b> require complex mechanical or electronic controllers to ensure this does not happen. Expander cycles are by design incapable of malfunctioning that way.|$|R
