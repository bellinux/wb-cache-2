5|$|This {{species is}} often {{confused}} with the copperhead, A. contortrix. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> juveniles, but differences exist. A. piscivorus has broad, dark stripes {{on the sides of}} its head that extend back from the eye, whereas A. contortrix has only a thin, dark line that divides the pale supralabials from the somewhat darker color of the head. The watersnakes of the genus Nerodia are also similar in appearance, being thick-bodied with large heads, but they have round pupils, no loreal pit, a single anal plate, subcaudal scales that are divided throughout, and a distinctive overall color pattern.|$|E

30|$|The rare {{aggressive}} NK-cell leukemia (ANKL) {{is primarily}} described in Asian and South American populations (Lima 2013). The disease entity {{is described in}} the World Health Organization (WHO) classification for hematopoietic tumors and lymphoid tissues in 2008 but remains poorly characterized as the majority of publications comprise sporadic case reports. This <b>especially</b> holds <b>true</b> <b>for</b> European cases. The course of the disease is rapidly aggravating and nearly always fatal since the neoplastic cells respond poorly to therapy.|$|R
5|$|In tsunami prone regions, strong {{earthquakes}} {{serve as}} familiar warnings, {{and this is}} <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> earthquakes in Indonesia. Previous estimates of the tsunami hazard for the Java coastline may have minimized the risk to the area, and to the northwest along the Sumatran coast, the risk is substantially higher for tsunami, especially near Padang. Previous events {{along the coast of}} Java in 1921 and again in 1994 illustrate the need for an accurate assessment of the threat. The July 2006 earthquake had an unusually slow rupture velocity which resulted in minor shaking on land for around three minutes, but the intensity was very light relative {{to the size of the}} tsunami that followed.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{areas are}} the poorest. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> Topaana, in Čair municipality, and for Šuto Orizari municipality, {{which are the}} two main Roma neighbourhoods. They are made of many illegal constructions not connected to electricity and water supply, which are passed from a generation to the other. Topaana, located close to the Old Bazaar, is a very old area: it was first mentioned as a Roma neighbourhood {{in the beginning of}} the 14th century. It has between 3,000 and 5,000 inhabitants. Šuto Orizari, located on the northern edge of the city, is a municipality of its own, with Romani as its local official language. It was developed after the 1963 earthquake to accommodate Roma who had lost their house.|$|E
5|$|The loss of so {{many young}} men during the Second World War made it {{difficult}} for clubs to retain their former status. This was <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>for</b> Millwall, who appeared to suffer more than most. From being one of the country's biggest clubs before the war, Millwall were reduced to one of its smallest afterward. The Den sustained severe bomb damage on 19 April 1943, and one week later a fire, determined to have been caused by a discarded cigarette, also destroyed an entire stand. The club accepted offers from neighbours Charlton Athletic, Crystal Palace and West Ham United to stage games at their grounds. On 24 February 1944, Millwall returned to The Den, to play in an all-standing stadium. This was achieved with considerable volunteer labour by Lions fans. One of the biggest Cup upsets came in the fourth round of the 1956–57 FA Cup on 26 January 1957, when Millwall beat Newcastle United 2–1 in front of a crowd of 45,646. At the time the club was fighting for Third Division survival.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In a {{world where}} {{continuous}} operations are essential for business survival, action {{must be taken to}} ensure information and the business processes that use the information are continuously available. This usually involves the selection and implementation of a suitable Business Continuity Planning (BCP) methodology. Implementing a methodology is however not always a simple task. This <b>especially</b> holds <b>true</b> <b>for</b> small to medium sized organizations. Methodologies do not always specify how they are to be implemented. An implementation method that could be applied to virtually any BCP methodology would therefore be a welcome tool for organizations. 1...|$|R

To do so, it is also necessary to train researchers in performing research according to the best practice. This <b>especially</b> holds <b>true</b> <b>for</b> research working with humans or biological material, but also with any data related to humans. There has to be a standardised training structure also reflecting the actual state of the art for research procedures with the goal of fostering the efficiency of projects reflecting the research topics identified above especially in terms of optimal patient care and radiation protection.|$|R
30|$|We found a large {{discrepancy}} between preferred instruction style and reported instruction style. In particular, preferences for instruction style lean toward more active approaches. We note this preference for more active teaching is present across all demographic groups. We see that female leavers and leavers of color {{were the most}} likely to prefer active instruction styles but were the least likely to report experiencing it. This finding suggests that students from underrepresented groups who are leaving may have been affected by a mismatch in their preferred instruction style and the instruction styles they perceived in STEM courses. This may <b>especially</b> be <b>true</b> <b>for</b> women of color.|$|R

5000|$|The use of {{the amino}} acid {{glutamine}} as an energy source is facilitated by the multistep catabolism of glutamine called glutaminolysis. This energy pathway is upregulated in cancer, which may represent a therapeutic target as cancer cells {{are thought to be}} more dependent on glutamine than healthy cells. This <b>especially</b> holds <b>true</b> <b>for</b> specific tumor types that are metabolically dysregulated, such as malignant brain tumors (i.e. glioblastoma) that carry mutations in the IDH1 gene. These tumors use glutamine or the structurally related amino acid glutamate as an energy source and a chemotactic sensor in the brain, which increases their malignancy and may explain why these tumors grow so invasive.910 ...|$|R

30|$|This {{study found}} that athletes in younger to middle age groups (i.e. 25 – 35 to 50 – 65 years) {{depending}} upon sex and race distance seemed to have reached their limits due to a non-linear increase in running speed whereas runners in older age groups (i.e. older than 50 – 65 years) depending upon sex and race distance might still improve their performance due to a linear increase in running speed. However, very young ultra-marathoners (i.e. younger than 25 – 35 years) might also still be improving their performance. This might <b>especially</b> be <b>true</b> <b>for</b> female (i.e. age groups 25 – 29 and 30 – 34 years) and male (i.e. age group 18 – 24 years) 100 miles ultra-marathoners.|$|R

50|$|Conventional {{baseball}} wisdom suggests that, when {{a pitcher}} and a hitter pitch or bat {{with the same}} hand, the pitcher typically has the advantage. This <b>especially</b> holds <b>true</b> <b>for</b> left-handed pitchers, as lefties are less common in a major-league lineup than righties. As a result, the most common use of the lefty-righty switch is when a right-handed pitcher is facing a left-handed batter. The manager of the defensive team will sometimes go to the bullpen, especially in close games where a reliever has already entered the game, and pull out a left-handed specialist to face the left-handed batter. The new pitcher will then attempt to get the batter out. Whether he succeeds or fails, the pitcher will often be replaced after the at-bat.|$|R

40|$|This article explores whether {{employment}} insecurity (i. e. {{unemployment and}} fl exible employment) at labour market entry {{has a negative}} impact on parental home leaving and family formation. To answer this question, data from a large-scale European graduate survey carried out in 1998 were analysed. The results show that graduates with an insecure employment status at labour market entry are indeed less likely to leave the parental home and establish a nuclear household and family than those with stable fi rst employment. With regard to entry into marriage and parenthood, these results <b>especially</b> hold <b>true</b> <b>for</b> men. Furthermore, it is found that in European countries in which unemployment among tertiary education graduates is high, the likelihood of leaving the parental home and starting a nuclear household and family is smaller than in European countries where such unemployment is low. ...|$|R
