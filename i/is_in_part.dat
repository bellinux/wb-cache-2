5|$|Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, near Dania Beach, Florida, is the city's main {{airport and}} is the {{fastest-growing}} major airport in the country.

The disputes triggered by this teaching of Mahavira are those related to gender and whether a female mendicant (sadhvi) can achieve spiritual liberation just like a male mendicant (sadhu) through Jain ascetic practices.|$|E

5|$|Sources {{differ on}} the year of Linda Syddick's birth. The Art Gallery of South Australia {{suggests}} 1941; Birnberg and Kreczmanski's biographical survey suggests circa 1937. The ambiguity around the year of birth <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> because Indigenous Australians operate using a different conception of time, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events. She was born near Western Australia's Wilkinkarra, or Lake Mackay, northeast of Kiwirrkurra Community, Western Australia and northwest of Kintore, Northern Territory.|$|E

The ambiguity around the year of birth <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> because Indigenous Australians operate using a different conception of time, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events.

5|$|The Dole {{is thought}} to have {{originated}} in the Gudbrandsdal, an inland valley in the county of Oppland. It is likely that the Dole <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> a descendant of the Friesian, as the two breeds are similar in conformation, and the Frisian people were known traders in the area between 400 and 800 AD. There was also equine movement between western Norway and northern England during the 9th century through the mid-11th century; this extended period of trade between these areas likely influenced the strong resemblance between the Dole, Friesian, Fell Pony and Dale Pony breeds.|$|E

5|$|The charismatic {{movement}} {{forced a}} reevaluation {{of what it}} was to be Pentecostal. The Assemblies of God understood Spirit baptism in the context of baptistic evangelical theology and, by the 1950s, emphasized certain doctrines and practices as requisite for Spirit baptism. Charismatics challenged these views by claiming to receive Holy Spirit baptism outside of this context (such as remaining in liturgical churches, failing to reject sacramental theologies, and not adopting Pentecostal taboos on dancing, drinking, smoking, etc.). On the local level, Assemblies of God churches were influenced by the charismatic movement. Some charismatics left their original churches and joined less formal Assemblies of God congregations. In addition, the contemporary decreased emphasis on traditional Pentecostal taboos in the AG <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> attributable to the charismatic movement, which accelerated a trend already in existence.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} (shape) {{of volcanic}} ash {{is controlled by}} a plethora of different eruption and kinematic processes. Eruptions of low-viscosity magmas (e.g., basalt) typically form droplet shaped particles. This droplet shape <b>is,</b> <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> controlled by surface tension, acceleration of the droplets after they leave the vent, and air friction. Shapes range from perfect spheres {{to a variety of}} twisted, elongate droplets with smooth, fluidal surfaces.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{uncertainty about the}} identities of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania between Traidenis' death in 1282 and Vytenis' assumption of power in 1295. This <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> because the two main sources for Lithuanian history in the 13th century, the Hypatian Codex and the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, end in the early 1290s. In 1285, one chronicle mentions Daumantas as Grand Duke. He attacked the Bishop of Tver and was severely wounded or even killed in the battle. However, that is the only information about him.|$|E
