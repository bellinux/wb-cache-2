5|$|Equestrians {{by birth}} would {{normally}} begin their military careers at c. 30 years of age. An axillary {{had to do}} 25 years of service before joining the army. Commands were held <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> sequence, each held for 3–4 years: prefect of an auxiliary cohors, tribunus militum in a legion and finally prefect of an auxiliary ala. In Hadrian's time, a fourth command was added, for exceptionally able officers, of prefect of an ala milliaria. Like officers senatorial rank, hereditary equestrians held civilian posts before and after their decade of military service, whereas non-hereditary officers tended {{to remain in the}} army, commanding various units in various provinces. By the 3rd century, most auxiliary prefects had exclusively military careers.|$|E

Circinus was given its current name in 1763, when Lacaille published an updated sky map with Latin names for the constellations he introduced.|$|E

Addition of liothyronine should be regarded as experimental, initially only for a trial period of 3 months, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> ratio to the current dose of levothyroxine. The guideline explicitly aims to enhance the safety of this approach and to counter its indiscriminate use.|$|E

The performance was included <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of multiple songs off of Killer Love, and was sung in order to celebrate the shopping centre's opening. Scherzinger began her performance with a fringed leather coat in red and black, the colours of the Westfield logo, a cutaway black bodycon dress and purple platform heels which she whipped off to reveal an even racier outfit underneath. She than wore a black leather number covered in tassels and chains. Scherzinger's performance was accompanied onstage by several dancers, whom were wearing shiny metallic trousers, as she performed in front of thousands of fans. The song was also performed in 2012 on her first solo tour, the Killer Love Tour.|$|E

The pictures, when viewed from afar, blend to form the No Code triangle/eyeball logo that is the theme throughout the album.

5|$|Torque {{generated}} by the drive causes the induction motor to run at synchronous speed less the slip. If the load drives the motor faster than synchronous speed, the motor acts as a generator, converting mechanical power back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's DC link element (capacitor or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or braking DC chopper controls dissipation of this power as heat <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of resistors. Cooling fans {{may be used to}} prevent resistor overheating.|$|E
5|$|Zero is a number, {{and numbers}} {{are used for}} counting. Given a set of objects, one uses a number to {{describe}} how many objects are in the set. Zero is the count of no objects; in more formal terms, it {{is the number of}} objects in the empty set. The concept of parity is used for making groups of two objects. If the objects <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> can be marked off into groups of two, with none left over, then the number of objects is even. If an object is left over, then the number of objects is odd. The empty set contains zero groups of two, and no object is left over from this grouping, so zero is even.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{began working}} on The Dry Salvages during World War II {{at a time when}} London was {{experiencing}} air-raids near the end of 1940. During the time, he moved around often and spent his time writing mostly lectures or tiny poems. However, he was able to find time to work on the third poem that would become part of the Four Quartets: Eliot envisioned that Burnt Norton, East Coker, The Dry Salvages, and a fourth, yet uncreated poem would be united <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>set.</b> Eliot wrote the poem quickly and sent the first draft off on 1 January 1941 to John Hayward. After Hayward received the draft, the two began corresponding about corrections and alterations to the poem. Geoffrey Faber joined in and then the poem was soon finished. It was published in the February 1941 issue of the New English Weekly.|$|E
