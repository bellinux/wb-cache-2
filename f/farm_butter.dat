40|$|TypescriptIncludes bibliographical referencesM. S. University of Missouri 1911 Butter {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{articles}} of diet which is being manufactured today. Hayward, in collecting data concerning the history of butter, found it mentioned in the Vedas - written 2, 000 to 1, 400 B. C. Its importance at that time is uncertain but reports show that later its manufacture was practiced in countries which today have but few dairy interests. It has been used during the past for various purposes but probably never reached the importance commercially that it has at present. In addition to being a food, it was formerly used as an object for sacrifice in worship, a remedy for injuries to the skin, a hair dressing, an ointment for the body, an oil for lamps, and as an indication of wealth. It was not, however, until recent years that dairy farming and manufacture of butter took the important place that it now holds in agricultural science and practice. It was not until the establishment of agricultural schools and colleges that an effort was made to improve methods and product. The effort is now being made in all dairy sections and is due largely to the advance of agricultural science and the dissemination of knowledge through colleges, agricultural newspapers, bulletins and circulars. The present demand for butter as a food is such that it has proven profitable to increase the study of conditions affecting its quality and to improve methods in order that a better and more uniform product may be offered to the market and consumer. The demands of that market and its resulting classification of butter will enable a better understanding of the importance and position of dairy or <b>farm</b> <b>butter</b> on the American markets. The demands of the leading butter markets of the United States vary but little and are largely determined by the requirements as stated by the New York Merchantile Exchange.

50|$|When people didn't get {{the help}} they wanted from the priests or doctors, or if they couldn't afford to see a doctor, they would turn to Biddy. Her cures did not only consist of {{applying}} herbs to a wound or feeding a recipe to the sick. She was insightful and intuitive, which helped her to recognise and understand people's needs and choose appropriate yet creative measures to address them. Biddy was also called upon occasionally to treat animals. During her time, {{the death of an}} animal could lead to an inability to complete required tasks and cause a farm to fail. This was important because it could, in turn, lead to eviction and poverty and, in extreme cases, loss of human life. For the same reasons, farmers also asked Biddy to help with other problems related to daily life, such as restoring a spring well or fixing a problem with the <b>farm's</b> <b>butter</b> production.|$|R

25|$|Until the 19th century, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of butter was made by hand, on <b>farms.</b> The first <b>butter</b> factories appeared in the United States in the early 1860s, after the successful introduction of cheese factories a decade earlier. In the late 1870s, the centrifugal cream separator was introduced, marketed most successfully by Swedish engineer Carl Gustaf Patrik de Laval. This dramatically sped up the butter-making process by eliminating the slow step of letting cream naturally rise to the top of milk. Initially, whole milk was shipped to the butter factories, and the cream separation took place there. Soon, though, cream-separation technology became small and inexpensive enough to introduce an additional efficiency: the separation was accomplished on the farm, and the cream alone shipped to the factory. By 1900, more than half the butter produced in the United States was factory made; Europe followed suit shortly after.|$|R
50|$|The {{evolution}} of modern farming in Ireland in the 20th century is {{closely linked to}} the activities of Horace Plunkett, founder of the co-operative movement and the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland in 1899.As the co-operative movement evolved largely to support dairy <b>farming</b> and <b>butter</b> production {{in the early part of}} the 20th century, it was natural that pig farming would continue to develop alongside it as the by-products of dairy (whey from cheese andcasein production, and skim milk) provided an excellent and cheap source of feed for pigs. Significant pork production facilities were established, for example, in the town of Mitchelstown, County Cork, which was also a major centre of dairy and cheese production.The modern pig industry began to take shape from the 1960s, when the first large pig units were developed and coincided with introduction of the Landrace breed, which had its origins in Denmark, from the 1950s onward. The Landrace and the Large White are, today, the dominant breed of pig in commercial production in Ireland. In the decades 1960 to 1990, a government breeding programme brought about rapid improvements in carcass leanness in both, a process further supported by importation of high-quality breeding stock.From the 1990s onward, a new breeding model has emerged reflecting the disappearance of traditional small breeders and the large-scale uptake of artificial insemination (AI) in the commercial sector. The majority of pig units now use almost 100 per cent AI.Internationally, there are three main models for pig production: vertical integration; co-operative ownership; and independent producer. The majority of pig production units in Ireland are of the third kind, independently operated and family owned.Today, there are approximately 440 commercial pig units in Ireland, of which some 290 are fully integrated breeding to finishing units. Areas where pig production is particularly concentrated include Cavan, Cork and South Tipperary. Though pig farming is, in the majority of cases, a farm-family operated business it is also predominantly a specialised undertaking, i.e., the sole or main enterprise on the farm.|$|R
40|$|Cumberland County, Kentucky, is {{situated}} on the Tennessee line just at {{the western edge of}} the Appalachian Mountains. The county 2 ̆ 7 s terrain is typical of land in the foothills of a mountain range and varies from flat farmland and good bottomland along the Cumberland River to steep, wooded hillsides and rough, rocky ridge tops. Areas often take part of their names from outstanding topographic features of the land. Community names such as White 2 ̆ 7 s Bottom, Howard 2 ̆ 7 s Bottom, Cherry Tree Ridge and Bow Schoolhouse Ridge are common in Cumberland County. On Pea Ridge, which runs along the north shore of Dale Hollow Lake, is the small community of Peytonsburg. To the casual observer, Peytonsburg would probably appear similar to other small communities scattered upon the countryside, but a closer examination of the area 2 ̆ 7 s culture will show that the people of Peytonsburg still cling to a lifestyle that disappeared in most of the United States more than half a century ago. A farmer who uses only mules as a source of power splits fence rails from hickory logs; two women still spin wool on their spinning wheels, and most of the women in the area make patchwork quilts, one man makes his living by such traditional activities as digging ginseng and sassafras roots and hunting and trapping; a traditional chairmaker and several broommakers still practice their crafts, a <b>farm</b> wife makes <b>butter</b> by hand in an old crock churn with a wooden dasher; and one family operates a sorghum mill to make molasses for community members each fall. A community in which people still retain this many elements of traditional lifestyles is unique, indeed. But even more remarkable is the fact that they all live on a one-mile strip of Pea Ridge, starting just above the Peytonsburg Post Office and extending to the backwaters of the lake. (Appendix one on page sixty-nine contains a map of this section of Pea Ridge.) The purpose of this study is to document the unusually rich folk culture of this small community and to discuss the reasons for the tenacity with which the folk cling to their traditional way of life...|$|R
