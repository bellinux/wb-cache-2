One of these was the [...] "omnitonic" [...] horn invented by Hermann Prager in 1918 and built by Knopf of Markneukirchen, but its complicated mechanism made the instrument very heavy. A more successful model which added a valve to lower {{both sides of the}} instrument by a semitone (from B to A and from F to <b>E)</b> <b>was</b> patented by <b>Paul</b> Geyer of Schwerin in 1924. The extra valve not only made playing difficult passages in sharp keys easier, but also acted as a [...] "compensating" [...] mechanism for the otherwise sharp pitch of stopped notes on the B side.|$|R

5000|$|Edward Paul Waggoner, {{best known}} as <b>E.</b> <b>Paul,</b> <b>was</b> born in 1889 to Ella (Halsell) and William Thomas Waggoner. Tom Waggoner was an infant when his father Daniel Waggoner {{acquired}} land south of the Red River near Vernon, Texas and started a ranch with a few hundred head of longhorn cattle and some horses. [...] At the time, the Red River separated Texas from what was known as Indian Territory; it was {{an area where the}} Comanche and Kiowa made frequent raids. Tom was instrumental in expanding their land holdings into what became the sprawling Waggoner Ranch, the largest ranch under one fence in the United States. E. Paul had two siblings, a brother Guy Waggoner and sister Electra Waggoner. They were raised in the Waggoner Mansion (a.k.a. 'El Castile') in Decatur, Texas but also spent time on the Waggoner Ranch which was headquartered near Vernon, Texas. Their horse program headquarters was referred to as Whiteface.|$|R
