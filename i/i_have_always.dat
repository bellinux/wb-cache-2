5|$|I {{have been}} {{thinking}} how very gently <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been dealt with. I {{have never had a}} violent shove all my life. The only desire which I can have is like David to serve my own generation by the will of God, and then fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|While <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> {{believed}} {{that under the}} First and Fourteenth Amendments neither the State nor the Federal Government has any authority to regulate or censor the content of speech, I have never {{believed that}} any person {{has a right to}} give speeches or engage in demonstrations where he pleases and when he pleases.|$|E
5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
60|$|This was {{my first}} conviction; made by the shock of my childish {{emotions}} meeting the modern creed in mid-career. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> vaguely felt facts to be miracles {{in the sense that}} they are wonderful: now I began to think them miracles in the stricter sense that they were WILFUL. I mean that they were, or might be, repeated exercises of some will. In short, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> believed that the world involved magic: now I thought that perhaps it involved a magician. And this pointed a profound emotion always present and sub-conscious; that this world of ours has some purpose; and if there is a purpose, there is a person. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> felt life first as a story: and if there is a story there is a story-teller.|$|R
60|$|I {{thought him}} a terribly slow, stupid old body, and {{wondered}} how <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> entertained so high an opinion of his sense.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{no doubt}} he {{knew there would be}} {{something}} in the simple image of the poor afflicted creature that would fall like a gentle lesson on my mind at that time. I felt it as he spoke to me. I could not tell him heartily enough how ready I was to receive her. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> pitied her, never so much as now. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been glad of my little power to soothe her under her calamity, but never, never, half so glad before.|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> urged {{fighting}} {{wars and}} other contentions with might and main till overwhelming victory and then extending {{the hand of}} friendship to the vanquished. Thus <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been against the Pacifists during the quarrel and the Jingoist at its close...I thought we should have conquered the Irish then given them Home Rule...and that after smashing the General Strike we should have met the grievances of the miners.|$|E
25|$|On the {{occasion}} of my 27th birthday I decided to do a tape that chronicled my passage through time. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been clumsy, tripping, dropping, falling with alarming regularity. This tape accepts {{the extent of the}} consequences.|$|E
25|$|This conduct {{upon his}} part seems {{perfectly}} unaccountable...You know that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> counselled you to bear everything and remain to the last. I thought {{it for the}} best. I am afraid {{it is no longer}} possible. Open breaches of this kind are always to be lamented, but you have the consolation that you have done your utmost to stave this extremity off as long as possible.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was most}} {{fortunate}} {{to get the}} house," [...] she answered. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> grown to love it. Sometimes {{it seems as though}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> lived here." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> {{liked the}} young woman. Mr. Quincey had {{suggested}} my waiting till after Wednesday. But {{there seemed to}} me no particular object in delay.|$|R
60|$|I {{said that}} such a hope was most {{delightful}} to my feelings, but that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> regarded the indulgence {{of it as a}} dangerous one.|$|R
25|$|My son! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been a {{careless}} and injudicious mother to you, and I {{am about to}} propose a most imprudent step. You are now of age, and it's high time you {{began to think of}} taking a wife. Several old and hideous princesses who are enormously poor have proposed for your hand, and I think it high time you began to think of making one of them unhappy.|$|E
25|$|Post this intimation, I was {{informed}} {{for the first}} time yesterday by the BCCI that the Captain had reservations with my 'style' and about my continuing as the Head Coach. I was surprised since <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> respected the role boundaries between Captain and Coach. Though the BCCI attempted to resolve the misunderstandings between the Captain and me, it was apparent that the partnership was untenable, and I therefore believe it is best for me to move on.|$|E
25|$|I {{think it}} is up to the states to work out their social {{problems}} if possible, and while <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been interested in seeing that the Negro has a square deal, I have never dissipated my strength against the particular stone wall of segregation. I believe that wall will crumble when the Negro has brought himself to a high educational and economic status…. Moreover, while there are no segregation laws in the North, there is segregation in fact and we might as well recognize this.|$|E
60|$|Surprised, and {{a little}} uncomfortable at this {{evidence}} of intuition, I started to protest. It seemed to me then as though <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> wanted her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then he did {{see things}} {{differently}} at last?" [...] I said, {{hoping to find}} that the sentiments <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> heard condemned <b>had</b> not been perpetuated.|$|R
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 The {{sky was a}} dark and gloomy gray; I {{expected}} the rain to start falling at any moment. I stared at my father 2 ̆ 7 s unmoving body, draped in his best suit. His face bore the same unhappy look that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been accustomed to. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> felt that my father would rather be dead, because he never really seemed to enjoy life. 2 ̆...|$|R
25|$|There {{have been}} no designs made for this {{elevation}} (Bedford Avenue), but the aim has been to have a central tower on the same axis as that on Flatbush Avenue, through the archway {{in the base of}} which will be afforded a view of the ‘quad’ with its greensward, trees, shrubs and vines. What the ultimate design of the various buildings going to make up the group may be, it is, of course, impossible to say, but in designing and planning that portion which you now see approaching completion, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> intended that the whole should be a graphic illustration of the various phases of the so-called Gothic movement, from the Round Arch to the Flamboyant and on through its later transitional stage.|$|E
25|$|The Cheyennes do {{not fight}} {{at all this}} side of the Arkansas; they do not trouble Texas, but north of the Arkansas they are almost always at war. When lately north of the Arkansas, some young Cheyennes were fired upon and then the fight began. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> done my best to keep my young men quiet, but some will not listen, and since the {{fighting}} began I {{have not been able to}} keep them all at home. But we all want peace, and I would be glad to move all my people down this way; I could then keep them all quietly near camp. My camp is now on the Washita, 40 miles east of the Antelope Hills, and I have there about 180 lodges. I speak only for my own people; I cannot speak nor control the Cheyennes north of the Arkansas.|$|E
25|$|I {{will say}} {{to you and to}} the colored race that men who bore arms and {{followed}} the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E
6000|$|... "Silence, dear friends," [...] said she. [...] "Would that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> {{counsellors}} {{who would}} deal with me with such honour and disinterestedness. Then should I not be here." ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> {{known that}} this was the one flaw in my dedication, but how could <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{expected}} her to have the wit to see it? I was very depressed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I {{was pleased}} to hear this. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been pretty sharp in the office, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never dreamed that I was {{talked about in the}} City in this fashion.|$|R
500|$|... "The {{hundreds}} of interviews I have conducted {{over the past}} 40 years have been utilised. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> been a hoarder of clippings in addition to collecting magazines, fanzines, newspapers and books. I'll never tire of it." ...|$|E
500|$|On 6 December 1829, the House of Representatives of Buenos Aires elected Rosas {{governor}} and granted him facultades extraordinarias (extraordinary powers). This {{marked the beginning}} of his regime, described by historians as a dictatorship. He saw himself as a benevolent dictator, saying: [...] "For me the ideal of good government would be paternal autocracy, intelligent, disinterested and indefatigable... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> admired the autocratic dictators who have been the first servants of their people. That is my great title: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> sought to serve the country." [...] He used his power to censor his critics and banish his enemies. He later justified these measures, stating: [...] "When I took over the government I found the government in anarchy, divided into warring factions, reduced to pure chaos, a hell in miniature..." ...|$|E
500|$|With his {{military}} background, Morgan was {{appalled at the}} corruption, inefficiency and political diversion of UNRRA. A member of his staff said that [...] "to serve such an outfit is degradation beyond description. [...] In fact, , to have been rejected for such service <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> felt {{to have been a}} high honour." ...|$|E
40|$|Fear can {{interrupt}} {{the continuum of}} memory <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> thought {{that the existence of}} post-traumatic amnesia, characterised by gaps in the patient’s memory of events after an accident, particularly if the remaining “snapshots ” of memory were particularly vivid, meant that the patient must have been knocked out, albeit briefly. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> rejected the concept that fear, acute anxiety, panic, that which the layman calls “shock”, could be responsible for the phenomena of post-traumatic amnesia. That is until about 6 months ago. I was driving in the wet, too fast, in a con...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> {{lived alone}} with Hester. I did not {{remember}} our parents, {{who had died in}} my babyhood. Hester was fifteen years older than <b>I,</b> and she <b>had</b> <b>always</b> seemed more like a mother than a sister. She had been very good to me and had never denied me anything I wanted, save the one thing that mattered.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> {{regarded}} “Two Lovely Black Eyes” as {{rather a}} commonplace tune until that evening. The rich vein of sadness that George extracted from it quite surprised me.|$|R
500|$|In 2005, O'Brien {{started writing}} a book on Madonna, where she wanted to look at her life and work, as the artist was {{approaching}} the age of fifty. She believed that the general public was eager to know the real-self of Madonna, and she concentrated on finding that out. According to her, [...] "the popular negative stereotype about the artist is that of a publicity-hungry, manipulative ball-breaker, while for many woman she is a beacon of feminism. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> found her work clear and autobiographical, but her personality complex and disarmingly changeable." ...|$|E
500|$|Two years later, in November 1974, Chatwin {{flew out}} to Lima in Peru, and reached Patagonia a month later. He would later {{claim that he}} sent a {{telegram}} to Wyndham merely stating: [...] "Have gone to Patagonia." [...] Actually he sent a letter: [...] "I am doing a story there for myself, something <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> wanted to write up." [...] This {{marked the end of}} Chatwin's role as a regular writer for [...] The Sunday Times Magazine, although in subsequent years he contributed occasional pieces, including a profile of Indira Gandhi.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} any hard feelings, Voorhis sent Nixon {{a letter of}} {{congratulations}} in early December 1946. The two men met for an hour at Voorhis's office and parted, according to Voorhis, as friends. Voorhis's final letter as a congressman, on December 31, was to his father, who had been his political adviser throughout his congressional career, [...] "It has been primarily due to your help, your confidence, your advice... above all to a feeling <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> had that your hand was on my shoulder. Thanks... God bless you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O yes, indeed! It's a {{beautiful}} old town, with {{everything in it}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> read about and never expected to see. You know it's a walled city." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> {{wanted to}} be a {{dramatic}} critic. A taste for sitting back and watching other people work, so essential to the make-up of this sub-species of humanity, <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been one of the leading traits in my character.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{never before}} {{known that the}} human leg did unscrew. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> {{thought it was a}} fixture. But the man showed me how to undo them, and I found that they came off quite easily.|$|R
