25|$|Bud Moore Engineering took {{a three-year}} hiatus until 1972, when David Pearson piloted the No. 15 Ford to a 26th-place finish at Riverside. LeeRoy Yarbrough, Dick Brooks, and Donnie Allison also drove that year. In 1973, Bobby Isaac climbed {{on board with}} Sta-Power Industries sponsoring. Isaac had six top-ten {{finishes}} until the Talladega 500, when he radioed in to Moore {{and told him he}} was quitting. When he <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> Isaac announced he was retiring. Some reports surfaced saying Isaac quit because voices in his head had told him to. His replacement was an unpolished rookie named Darrell Waltrip, who had a top-ten at Darlington Raceway.|$|E

500|$|Afework Hagos, a {{computer}} programmer, {{was on his}} way to work and stuck in a traffic jam near the Pentagon when the airplane flew over. [...] "There was a huge screaming noise and I <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> as the plane came over. Everybody was running away in different directions.

500|$|Adam {{later told}} UK daily {{newspaper}} The Guardian: [...] "No one was allowed in Fort Knox but because [...] Cubby Broccoli {{had some good}} connections and the Kennedys loved Ian Fleming's books I was allowed to fly over it once. It was quite frightening - they had machine guns on the roof. I was also allowed to drive around the perimeter but if you <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> there was a loudspeaker warning you to keep away. There was not a chance of going in it, and I was delighted because I knew from going to the Bank of England vaults that gold isn't stacked very high and it's all underwhelming. It gave me the chance to show the biggest gold repository {{in the world as}} I imagined it, with gold going up to heaven. I came up with this cathedral-type design. I had a big job to persuade Cubby and the director Guy Hamilton at first." ...|$|E
500|$|Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and {{frontman}} Pete Shelley {{have both}} been credited with suggesting the band name [...] "Stiff Kittens", but settled on [...] "Warsaw" [...] shortly before their first gig, referencing David Bowie's song [...] "Warszawa". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. They received immediate national exposure due to reviews of the gig in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Mason was soon made the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. During his tenure with Warsaw, Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik and even got Curtis to audition for the band. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded a set of five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the demo sessions. Driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> they sped off.|$|E

Since then I've usually waited outside in the car and she's handled everything herself." ...|$|E

As they were drawing up to the stop, Straffen saw some men in uniform and asked whether they were police; on {{learning}} that they were, he swiftly <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and ran away. Kenyon told the men (who were actually Broadmoor nurses) of the suspicious behaviour of her passenger, and Straffen was recaptured a few minutes later.

2500|$|The Guardian {{published}} on 30 March 2007 a story detailing inconsistencies between an account Blair gave of {{his involvement in}} the Balcombe Street Siege on the night of 6 December 1975, and the recollections of others involved at the time. In a 2006 interview, Blair had stated: [...] "We turned the corner, and there is the car ... It was a very defining moment. I think I spent the next half an hour pretending to be a bush. They <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and started firing at us. It is an interesting experience being fired at when you have absolutely nothing to fire back with ... I loved it.

Purnell said: [...] "I've never for one second associated Ian Blair with Balcombe Street in any shape or form, and his account of seeing [...] {{get out of the}} car and being shot at as they <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> is totally impossible." [...] Blair admitted he had not personally seen the IRA men getting out of their car and opening fire, and stated: [...] "I didn't see it and I didn't say I saw it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sutcliffe {{assaulted}} {{a prostitute}} {{he had met}} whilst searching {{for a woman who}} had tricked him out of money. He left his friend's minivan and walked up St Paul's Road in Bradford until he was out of sight. When he returned, he was out of breath, {{as if he had been}} running. He told his friend Trevor Birdsall to drive off quickly. Sutcliffe said he had followed a prostitute into a garage and hit her over the head with a stone in a sock. According to his statement, Sutcliffe said, [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> went across the road and hit her. The force of the impact tore the toe off the sock and whatever was in it came out. I went back to the car and got in it".|$|E
2500|$|A BBC Inside Story episode, [...] "Chappaquiddick," [...] {{broadcast}} on the 25th {{anniversary of the}} death of Mary Jo Kopechne, advanced a theory that Kennedy and Kopechne had gone out from the party in Kennedy's car, but when Kennedy saw an off-duty policeman in his patrol car, he <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> fearing the political consequences of being discovered by the police late at night with an attractive woman. According to the theory, Kennedy then returned to the party, and Kopechne, unfamiliar both with the large car and the local area, drove the wrong way and crashed off the bridge. The episode argued that the explanation would account for Kennedy's lack of concern the next morning, as he was unaware of the crash, and for the forensic evidence of the injuries to Kopechne being inconsistent with her sitting in the passenger seat.|$|E
2500|$|A {{dark green}} Jeep Cherokee, {{registration}} number L808 RDT, travelling {{at a speed}} estimated by a witness as about 30mph (48km/h), struck security bollards in a terror ramming attack at the main entrance to Glasgow Airport. The vehicle {{was reported to have}} several petrol containers and propane gas canisters on board. One eyewitness said flames issued from beneath the car when it hit the building, while another eyewitness said it appeared the driver was trying to drive through the terminal doors. According to reports, the car was occupied by two [...] "Asian-looking" [...] men. When the Jeep failed to explode, one man (later identified as Abdulla) threw petrol bombs from the passenger seat and the other (Ahmed) doused himself in petrol and set it alight. Police indicated the vehicle burst into flames when it was driven at the terminal. An eyewitness noted that a man <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and began to fight with police. Another eyewitness said that the man was throwing punches and repeatedly shouting [...] "Allah". The man was arrested and later identified as Bilal Abdulla, a UK-born doctor of Iraqi descent who was working at the Royal Alexandra Hospital. Another man exited the car and ran into the terminal building while he was on fire and began writhing on the ground, before being kicked in the testicles by an airport employee, John Smeaton, who was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal for his heroism. Sky News reported that petrol was spread from containers by the occupants when they <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> During the subsequent investigation propane gas canisters were removed from the car. A Strathclyde Police spokesman confirmed the two men in the car were arrested, one of them badly burned. The man was initially taken to Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley before being transferred to the intensive care unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary due to it having a specialist burns unit, where he died on 2 August. The Jeep was removed early on the morning of Sunday 1 July before flights resumed and the airport was partially reopened.|$|E
