5|$|However, while {{pleasing}} to Riker's mind, the passionate dreams only worsen Riker's condition, as the virus feeds {{on the positive}} endorphins his brain is creating. Pulaski and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) therefore agree {{to try to make}} the machine <b>evoke</b> negative dreams instead. Thus Riker dreams of Lieutenant Tasha Yar's (Denise Crosby) death, or the apparent death of Deanna Troi's child (R. J. Williams). This has the desired effect, as the negative endorphins drive the virus away, but the endorphins are not strong enough. As a last resort, Pulaski uses the machine to <b>evoke</b> dreams of raw, primitive feelings of fear and survival. Thus Riker dreams of fighting the tar creature Armus (Mart McChesney), the alien-controlled Admiral Gregory Quinn (Ward Costello), and the Klingon officer Klag (Brian Thompson) on board the warship Pagh. Seeing that the raw emotions work best, Pulaski intensifies the dreams to come at a more rapid pace. This finally kills the virus and Riker recovers.|$|E

Binaural interaction of the early- (0 - 10 ms), middle- (10 - 50 ms) and long-latency (50 - 200 ms) auditory <b>evoked</b> potentials was studied in 17 normal young adults. For the early components, binaural interaction was maximal at 7. 35 ms accounting for a reduction of 21 % of the amplitude of the binaural <b>evoked</b> potentials. For the middle latency auditory <b>evoked</b> potentials, binaural interaction was maximal at 39. 6 ms accounting for a reduction of 48 % of the binaural <b>evoked</b> potential. For the long-latency auditory <b>evoked</b> potentials, binaural interaction was maximal at 145 ms accounting for a reduction of 38 % of the binaural <b>evoked</b> potential.

In this review, the principal indications and limitations of monitoring various <b>evoked</b> responses during surgery on the brain and spinal cord are discussed.

40|$|Background: There {{has been}} little enthusiasm for {{somatosensory}} <b>evoked</b> potential monitoring in cervical spine sur-gery as a result, in part, of the increased risk of motor tract injury at this level, to which somatosensory monitoring may be insensitive. Transcranial electric motor <b>evoked</b> potential monitoring allows assessment of the motor tracts; therefore, we compared transcranial electric motor <b>evoked</b> potential and somatosensory <b>evoked</b> potential monitoring during cervical spine surgery to determine the temporal relationship between {{the changes in the}} potentials demon-strated by each type of monitoring and neurological sequelae and to identify patient-related and surgical factors asso-ciated with intraoperative neurophysiological changes. Methods: Somatosensory <b>evoked</b> potential and transcranial electric motor <b>evoked</b> potential data recorded for 427 patients undergoing anterior or posterior cervical spine surgery between January 1999 and March 2001 were ana-lyzed. All patients who showed substantial (at least 60 %) or complete unilateral or bilateral amplitude loss, for at least ten minutes, during the transcranial electric motor <b>evoked</b> potential and/or somatosensory <b>evoked</b> potential monitoring were identified.

40|$|The {{properties}} of eye movements <b>evoked</b> by cerebellar microstimulation were investigated in alert, encephale isole cats. Repetitive stimuli (20 - 500 Hz, 20 - 500 μA) {{were applied to}} the vermis, lobules V-VII with tungsten microelectrodes. Horizontal and vertical DC-EOGs were recorded with a rectigraph. In many cases, the <b>evoked</b> eye movements were also recorded two-dimensionally with an XY-recorder. We analyzed the dependence of the <b>evoked</b> eye movements on the stimulus parameter, stimulus sites and initial eye positions. 1) Two types of eye movements, saccades and smooth eye movements were <b>evoked.</b> The sites for the lowest stimulus threshold (about 20 μA) were both in the Purkinje cell layer and the deep layer of the white matter. The types of the <b>evoked</b> eye movements were not dependent upon the stimulus sites. Directions of the <b>evoked</b> eye movements were contingent on the stimulus sites. Horizontal eye movements were <b>evoked</b> by the stimulation of the lobule VI. The eye movements <b>evoked</b> by the stimulation of the lobule V and VII contained predominantly upward and downward components respectively. Straight upward and downward eye movements were induced by the stimulation of the midline vermis. 2) The velocity and amplitude of the <b>evoked</b> eye movements were not dependent on the stimulus parameters. The peak velocities of saccades increased {{in proportion to the}} amplitude of the <b>evoked</b> eye movements. The amplitude of the <b>evoked</b> eye movements depended upon the initial positions of the eye in the orbit, and the <b>evoked</b> eye movements tended to reach the same final goal in the orbit regardless of initial eye positions. 3) Such goal-directed eye movements were <b>evoked</b> in 80 % of all the stimulus sites. In 70 % of those sites the movements were goal-directed both horizontally and vertically. In the remaining 30 % the movements were goal-directed either horizontally or vertically. The eccentricities of the goal positions increased with stimulus intensity and frequency. The goal positions of the movements <b>evoked</b> by the simultaneous stimuli of the two different sites were obtained by vectorial addition of the two eye movements <b>evoked</b> by the stimulation of each site.
