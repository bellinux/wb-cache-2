40|$|The EU protects EU growers of 15 {{kinds of}} {{fresh fruits and}} {{vegetables}} against international competition by the <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> <b>system</b> (EPS), which is designed to restrict imports below the product-specific, politically designated entry price level. This study investigates the relevance of the EPS per product and country of origin. We develop two indicators for the effectiveness of the EPS, which serve as variables in a cluster analysis identifying four classes differing in the relevance of the EPS. The relevance of the EPS is found to be heterogeneous among products as well as countries of origin. It is highest for artichokes, courgettes, cucumbers, lemons, plums and tomatoes. The influence of the EPS on apples, clementines and pears is significantly lower, and of least relevance for apricots, mandarins, oranges, peaches and nectarines and table grapes. The EPS has the greatest effect on countries which neighbour the EU, whereas it is of minor importance for exports from far-away countries with the exception of China and South Africa. <b>Entry</b> <b>price</b> <b>system</b> Fruits and vegetables Import policy EU Non-tariff barriers Minimum import price...|$|E
40|$|China's {{exports of}} {{apples and pears}} to the EU have {{increased}} substantially, although the EU production of apples and pears is protected by the EU <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> <b>system</b> (EPS), aiming to protect EU producers against international competition by restricting imports below a minimum import price. This study investigates {{the relevance of the}} EPS for Chinese exports of apples and pears to the EU accounting for changes over time and seasonal variation. Our results suggest that the high relevance of the EPS for apples originating in China was of temporary nature, whereas the relevance of the EPS for pears originating in China is of a more general nature. In addition, the relevance of the EPS varies seasonally. Finally, we find that the production of pears in China is more competitive than the production of apples vis-à-vis the EU. Therefore, China's fresh fruit and vegetable (FFV) producers would benefit more from an improved EU market access for pears than for apples. Thus, China should put more effort in negotiating improved EU market access conditions for pears rather than for apples.

40|$|The <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> {{regime in}} the European Union (EU) applies to several products, mainly fresh fruits and vegetables. The {{complexity}} of the system with endogenous applied tariffs makes the evaluation of different alternatives of tariff cuts more challenging than for other regimes. The challenge applies to academics with interest on estimating market impacts, to WTO negotiators that need to evaluate proposals and to policy-makers that may need to take decisions on options such as the declaration of a sensitive product. This paper develops a methodology to compare different tariff cuts alternatives, including the URAA method that implies reductions {{in the level of}} the <b>entry</b> <b>price,</b> constant <b>entry</b> <b>price,</b> and Tariff Rate Quotas expansion. Uncertainty about international prices plays a central role on the estimated impacts on market access of different options. Reducing the level of <b>entry</b> <b>prices</b> can have relatively large impacts on market access for some products. The sensitive product treatment with TRQs may generate larger market access than the normal treatment. The proposed methodology proofs to be able to quantify the economic impacts of tariff cuts under EU <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> regime. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

40|$|EU {{imports of}} oranges are {{restricted}} {{not only by}} ad valorem tariffs {{but also by the}} <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> <b>system</b> establishing a minimum import price. In addition, the EU applies a comprehensive system of trade preferences. The hypothesis of this paper is that, in contrast to its complexity, the effectiveness of the EU import system for oranges is low with respect to its goals, i. e. protecting EU producers and creating imports from preference receiving countries. The comparison of import prices for oranges from extra-EU countries with the EU entry price shows that the former are about 40 % higher than the latter on average. Also, it is pointed out that at least 72 % of extra-EU orange imports during the EU harvest season enter the EU tariff free. As a conclusion, the contribution of the import regime to the protection of EU producers is low. Concordantly, the preferential entry price is not utilized by orange preference receiving countries. Besides, although orange quotas increased from 1991 to 2003, actual exports from Mediterranean countries and thus quota filling rates have decreased over the same period. It is shown that EU trade preferences for oranges were not decisive for the development of Mediterranean countries' orange exports to the EU. In the light of the low effectiveness of the <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> <b>system</b> for oranges along with high transaction costs involved, its abolishment should be considered. Yet, results cannot be generalized, even not for citrus fruit, as is demonstrated for mandarins. trade preferences, oranges, tariff rate quota, entry price, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
40|$|The {{complexity}} {{derived from}} the bilateral trade liberalisation process in the Mediterranean region is difficult to represent in a trade model, {{not only because of}} the range of instruments still constraining trade but also because of the special nature of the most important traded goods (product differentiation and seasonality). Tariff-rate quotas (TRQ's) and the <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> <b>system</b> are clearly defined on a monthly basis for the fruits and vegetables trade flows towards the European Union (EU). This point makes efforts to model such a trade in yearly basis not representative of reality. We propose a static partial equilibrium model tailored to model trade impacts of specific policy instruments which considers imports from different sources as imperfect substitutes, following the non-linear Armington type model. Different policy scenarios have been run using the model, considering changes in TRQ's and Entry Price regimes, its tariffication and preference erosion. The results of model runs show that, as regards to EU producers, bilateral trade liberalisation with extension of TRQs would be the least dramatic scenario. By contrast, the phasing out of the <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> <b>system</b> would have serious consequences on EU producers. The model has also given detailed information on Morocco's interests in the negotiation, although it could easily include a larger number of suppliers. Morocco appears to be interested in multilateral liberalisation as well as in bilateral liberalisation. In fact, multilateral liberalisation will not cause a great deal of preference erosion against Moroccan exporters, unless tariff reductions only affect MFN suppliers.

Surprisingly, however, in 2007 / 08 it managed to more than halve its amber box {{compared with that of}} the previous year, easily achieving the reduction targets being touted in the Doha Round.

The model shows that when prices of tomato imports are below the trigger entry prices the EU tomato market becomes isolated. However, the contribution of the import regime on price stabilization is rather limited. Since tomato imports from Morocco are granted zero tariff if their price is higher than the trigger entry price within a yearly quota that is completely filled, the largest contribution to market stabilization may well come from the size of the quota. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of two {{important}} non-tariff measures presumed to simultaneously affect firms' decisions to export to the European Union (EU). As a novelty to the literature, we analyse the impacts of EU pesticide standards on African exports alongside a complementary non-tariff measure {{in the form of a}} minimum entry price control measure which aims to protect EU growers of certain fruits and vegetables against international competition. We represent these trade costs in the context of a Melitz firm heterogeneity framework using Helpman, Melitz and Rubenstein (2008) method. Analysis was based on Africa's exports of tomatoes to the EU from 2008 to 2013, using the gravity model of trade. Our results show that at both the extensive and intensive margins of trade, the high stringency of EU pesticide standard prevents new entry into the EU market, drives less productive firms away, and discourages existing exporters from expanding their market base. Furthermore, we find the EU <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> <b>system</b> acts like an export tax, inhibiting tomatoes export to the EU, but only at the intensive margin...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the access of Eastern and Southern Mediterranean countries to the EU {{fruit and vegetables}} market and provides {{a measure of the}} level of preferences from which they benefit. To take into account the complexity of EU protection in the F&V sector, in particular the seasonality of protection and the <b>Entry</b> <b>Price</b> <b>System,</b> we conducted our analysis at a very disaggregated level (eight digits of the nomenclature, monthly data). We showed that, on average, Mediterranean countries do have significant preferences compared to other countries exporting to the EU. However, the magnitude of the preferences differs among countries; Morocco has the highest preference, while Syria and Israel have the lowest. We simulated a multilateral reduction in the MFN tariffs (as planned in the Doha Round) and showed that this would reduce the heterogeneity within the zone by more strongly eroding the preferences of the most advantaged countries. The classification of Entry Price products as sensitive products would either benefit or have no effect on most Mediterranean countries.

40|$|The EU protects {{some of its}} {{fruits and}} {{vegetables}} through the <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> <b>system.</b> This system consists on a two-tiered tariff, with high-priced exports paying an ad valorem tariff, whereas low-priced exports pay also a supplementary specific tariff. The breaking point {{between high and low}} export prices is the entry price level decided by the EU, generally the same level for all third countries. In a few cases, some Southern Mediterranean partners of the EU have agreed a reduced entry price for their exports, together with the more common ad valorem tariff reduction. Among the indicators used for gauge the value of preferences, there is no one devoted to this case of reduced entry price, hence we develop a new indicator that allows to split which part of the preferential gains corresponds to the entry price reduction and which part corresponds to the "usual" ad valorem tariff reduction. We apply this methodology to Moroccan clementines trade flows, with two main findings: 1) The entry price reduction ranges up to 39 % of the economic value of preferences in some months; 2) Morocco is not maximizing the gains due to this reduction, and could take some trade and policy lessons, mainly trying to better fit to the concession or, if impossible, use it as negotiating capital in future reviews of the agreement.

40|$|The EU {{has signed}} new {{agreements}} with Ukraine, Moldavia, and Ukraine, the so-called Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA). This policy brief only focuses on Georgia to exemplify the mythology and some important {{specifics of the}} participating countries that differ somewhat, but are important for assessing the impact. The agreement with Georgia became effective in September 2016; therefore, accurate estimation of the quantified effects was delayed for some time. This policy brief focusses on {{the free trade agreement}} on agricultural products. Georgia benefits from trade preferences for import to the EU and the EU likewise from exports to Georgia. It is foreseen that tariffs will be abolished completely in the future, but at present it is only Georgia which has abolished tariffs for imports from the EU. The EU has only reduced the World Trade Organization (WTO) bounded rates and, in addition, it still applies the socalled <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> <b>system</b> and even quotas for imports of garlic. Effects on trade might be important because the EU still highly protects agricultural imports and thus the standard of living for the 50 percent of Georgians living mainly from farming may improve. The findings are that Georgia may gain in total, if traders live in Georgia. The gain results from both redirection of Georgian exports from other destinations and additional exports of Georgian products.
