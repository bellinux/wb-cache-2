5|$|The eggs hatch after 53 to 60days of {{incubation}} by both parents. Chicks {{are born}} with their <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> sometimes {{can take up to}} a week to leave the shell completely. The young are covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after five to six months, but continue to roost and forage with their parents until they are in their second year, at which point the parents typically turn their energies to a new nest. Ravens are the main predatory threat to condor eggs, while golden eagles and bears are potential predators of condor offspring.|$|E
5|$|Rodents may be born either altricial (blind, hairless and {{relatively}} underdeveloped) or precocial (mostly furred, <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> fairly developed) {{depending on the}} species. The altricial state is typical for squirrels and mice, while the precocial state usually occurs in species like guinea pigs and porcupines. Females with altricial young typically build elaborate nests before they give birth and maintain them until their offspring are weaned. The female gives birth sitting or lying down and the young emerge in the direction she is facing. The newborns first venture out of the nest {{a few days after}} they have opened their eyes and initially keep returning regularly. As they get older and more developed, they visit the nest less often and leave permanently when weaned.|$|E
5|$|The UK Album Downloads Chart is {{a weekly}} music chart that ranks the most {{downloaded}} albums in the United Kingdom. During the 2000s, the chart was {{compiled by the}} Official Charts Company (OCC) on behalf on the British music industry, and was based solely on Sunday-to-Saturday sales of non-subscription music downloads from selected online stores. The most successful artist of the decade was the British band Snow Patrol, who spent eight weeks at number one with their albums <b>Eyes</b> <b>Open</b> <b>and</b> A Hundred Million Suns. The record label that spent the most weeks at number one was Island Records â€“ with an artist roster that included Florence and the Machine, Amy Winehouse and Keane, Island spent 22 weeks at number one with nine different albums.|$|E

25|$|Mating between hyenas {{involves}} {{a number of}} short copulations with brief intervals, unlike canids, who generally engage in a single, drawn out copulation. Spotted hyena cubs are born almost fully developed, with their <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> erupting incisors and canines, though lacking adult markings. In contrast, striped hyena cubs are born with adult markings, closed eyes and small ears. Hyenas do not regurgitate food for their young and male spotted hyenas play no part in raising their cubs, though male striped hyenas do so.|$|E
25|$|The Gaze of the Gorgon (1992): a poem-film for BBC {{television}} by British poet Tony Harrison. The film {{examines the}} politics of conflict in the 20th century using the Gorgon as a metaphor. The imaginary narration {{of the film is}} done through the mouth of Jewish poet Heinrich Heine. The film describes the connection between the Corfu Gorgon at the Artemis Temple of Corfu and Kaiser Wilhelm II. Harrison concludes his 1992 film-poem by making a proposal that in the 1994 European Union summit in Corfu, Heine's statue be returned to Corfu on time to preside over the new Europe so that EU can keep its <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> not turn to stone from the Gorgon's gaze.|$|E
25|$|Sandhill cranes raise one brood per year. In nonmigratory populations, laying begins between December and August. In migratory populations, laying usually {{begins in}} April or May. Both {{members of a}} {{breeding}} pair build the nest using plant material from the surrounding area. Nest sites are usually marshes, bogs, or swales, though occasionally on dry land. Females lay one to three (usually two) oval, dull brown eggs with reddish markings. Both parents incubate the eggs for about 30 days. The chicks are precocial; they hatch covered in down, with their <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> able to leave the nest within a day. The parents brood the chicks {{for up to three}} weeks after hatching, feeding them intensively for the first few weeks, then gradually less frequently until they reach independence at 9 to 10 months old.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to an abnormally short gestation period, ruffed lemurs share another feature with small, nocturnal lemurs by producing the largest litters of the family Lemuridae.

[...] Sally's mouth movements [...] "were animated through the replacement method. During the animation process, [...] only Sally's face 'mask' was removed in order to preserve the order of her long, red hair. Sally had ten types of faces, each made with a series of eleven expressions (e.g. <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> closed, and various facial poses) and synchronized mouth movements." [...] The stop motion figurine of Jack was reused in James and the Giant Peach (also directed by Selick) as Captain Jack.|$|E
500|$|In the borderlands {{south of}} Tombstone {{there was only}} one {{passable}} route between Arizona and Mexico, a passage known as Guadalupe Canyon. In August 1881, 15 Mexicans carrying gold, coins and bullion to make their purchases were ambushed and killed in Skeleton Canyon. The next month Mexican Commandant Felipe Neri dispatched troops to the border, where they killed five Cowboys, including Old Man Clanton, in Guadalupe Canyon. The Earps knew that the McLaurys and Clantons were reputed to be mixed up in the robbery and murder in Skeleton Canyon. Wyatt Earp said in his testimony after the shootout, [...] "I naturally kept my <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> did not intend that any of the gang should get the drop on me if I could help it." ...|$|E

500|$|Beatles biographer Bob Spitz {{described}} Starkey's upbringing as [...] "a Dickensian {{chronicle of}} misfortune". Houses {{in the area}} were [...] "poorly ventilated, postage-stamp-sized ... patched together by crumbling plaster walls, with a rear door that opened onto an outhouse." [...] Crawford commented: [...] "Like all of the families {{who lived in the}} Dingle, he was part of an ongoing struggle to survive." [...] The children who lived there spent much of their time at Princes Park, escaping the soot-filled air of their coal-fuelled neighbourhood. Adding to their difficult circumstances, violent crime was an almost constant concern for people living in {{one of the oldest and}} poorest inner-city districts in Liverpool. Starkey later commented: [...] "You kept your head down, your <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> you didn't get in anybody's way." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{compound}} 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile (also called o-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile; chemical formula: C10H5ClN2), a cyanocarbon, is {{the defining}} {{component of a}} tear gas {{commonly referred to as}} CS gas, which is used as a riot control agent. [...] Exposure causes a burning sensation and tearing of the eyes {{to the extent that the}} subject cannot keep their <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> a burning irritation of the nose, mouth and throat mucous membranes causing profuse coughing, mucous nasal discharge, disorientation, and difficulty breathing, partially incapacitating the subject. [...] CS gas is an aerosol of a volatile solvent (a substance that dissolves other active substances and that easily evaporates) and 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile, which is a solid compound at room temperature. CS gas is generally accepted as being non-lethal. It was first synthesized by two Americans, Ben Corson and Roger Stoughton, at Middlebury College in 1928, and the chemical's name is derived from the first letters of the scientists' surnames.|$|E
500|$|The film {{industry}} is a subject of satire as well. For example, Japanese censorship often involved masking prohibited sections of the screen. Here Suzuki preemptively masked his own compositions but animated them and incorporated them into the film's design. In the story, after Hanada finds {{he is unable to}} kill Misako he wanders the streets in a state of confusion. The screen is obscured by animated images with accompanying sounds associated to her. The effects contributed to the eclectic visual and sound design while signifying his obsessive love. Author Stephen Teo proposed that the antagonistic relationship between Hanada and Number One may have been analogous of Suzuki's relationship with studio president KyÅ«saku Hori. He compared Hanada's antagonizers to those who had been pressuring Suzuki to rein in his style over the previous two years. Teo cited Number One's sleeping with his <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> urinating where he sits, which the character explains as techniques one must master to become a [...] "top professional." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder, {{and it was the}} last episode Mark Kirkland {{directed}} during his first year on the show. Kirkland and his animation team were relatively new to animation when they began working on the show, and to make the animation in this episode the best they had ever done, they incorporated all the techniques they had learned during their first year into it. Kirkland said animating Homer drunk was a challenge for him as he had to analyze how people behave when they are intoxicated by alcohol. He said of the animation: [...] "I shifted [...] <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> close, they're not working in sync. And of course Homer can't keep his balance so that's why he's shifting back and forth." [...] Kirkland was raised in New York City in an environment similar to the one where the marriage retreat was held. He therefore enjoyed drawing and overseeing the scenery for the episode, and the bait shop was based on the bait shops he visited when he grew up. Snake Jailbird, Springfield's resident recidivist felon, appeared {{for the first time on}} the show in this episode, though he was not named until season three's [...] "Black Widower". He appears at Bart and Lisa's wild house party. A woman named Gloria who seeks marriage counseling at the retreat was voiced by Julie Kavner. It is one of the few times in the history of the show that Kavner has voiced a character other than Marge and her relatives. Gloria's hair was based on Kirkland's assistant director Susie Dietter's hair.|$|E
500|$|Cubs {{are born}} with soft, {{brownish}} black hair, and weigh 1.5kg on average. Unique among carnivorous mammals, spotted hyenas are also born with their <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> with 6â€“7mm long canine teeth and 4mm long incisors. Also, cubs will attack each other shortly after birth. This is particularly apparent in same sexed litters, and can result {{in the death of}} the weaker cub. This neonatal siblicide kills an estimated 25% of all hyenas in their first month. Male cubs which survive grow faster and are likelier to achieve reproductive dominance, while female survivors eliminate rivals for dominance in their natal clan. Lactating females can carry [...] of milk in their udders. Spotted hyena milk has the highest protein and fat content of any terrestrial carnivore. Cubs will nurse from their mother for 12â€“16 months, though they can process solid food as early as three months. Mothers do not regurgitate food for their young. Females are very protective of their cubs, and will not tolerate other adults, particularly males, approaching them. Spotted hyenas exhibit adult behaviours very early in life; cubs have been observed to ritually sniff each other and mark their living space before the age of one month. Within ten days of birth, they are able to move at considerable speed. Cubs begin to lose the black coat and develop the spotted, lighter coloured pelage of the adults at 2â€“3 months. They begin to exhibit hunting behaviours at the age of eight months, and will begin fully participating in group hunts after their first year. Spotted hyenas reach sexual maturity at the age of three years. The average lifespan in zoos is 12 years, with a maximum of 25 years.|$|E
500|$|One {{to three}} eggs, {{normally}} two, are laid, {{with the second}} egg being laid between 24 and 48hours after the first. The eggs are variable in coloration and can be a light yellow-brown with dark brown blotches, creamy white with dark brown or grey blotches, or pale grey with brown mottling. The eggs weigh about [...] and have an average size of [...] by [...] The rockfowl begins to incubate after both eggs are laid. The time the rockfowl spends incubating varies greatly, though it is mostly for {{less than five minutes}} at a time with nearly two hours between sessions. Both the male and female rockfowl incubate. When the incubating bird's mate comes, it gives a brief call that causes the incubating bird to leave the nest. In the two days prior to hatching, the adult rockfowl prods at the eggs, sometimes with food in its beak. Incubation lasts for 21 to 24 days. When the infants hatch, they hatch about a day apart. The adult rockfowl quickly remove the eggshell fragments from the nest. The newborn weighs only [...] after hatching, but it quickly gains weight. The <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> the tail begins to grow on the fifth day. During the first couple of days, food is brought to the nestlings three to six times an hour, peaking in the evening. Begging nestlings expose their beak and gape to their parent, though they do not make a sound. The second-hatched nestling often fails to gain weight and dies, and there is evidence suggesting that the adults cannibalize the remains. For the first ten days after hatching, one adult rockfowl stays and guards the nestlings while the other collects food; despite this, nests have been destroyed by chimpanzees and drills. The chicks leave the nest after 24 days. Infanticide has been recorded in this species, with rockfowl killing other rockfowl's young. In one case, a second pair of rockfowl moved onto a nest after killing the first pair's nestlings.|$|E
