5|$|Although {{specimens}} of M.griveaudi differ by only 0.6% in their cytb sequences, analysis of D-loop data does show some differentiation between the island populations. These <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> species originated on Madagascar, where a large, stable population persists, and independently colonized Grande Comore and Anjouan; subsequently, the Grande Comore and Anjouan populations came into contact, resulting in inter-island gene flow.|$|E
5|$|On this hypothesis, the {{molecular}} <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bombini are 25 to 40 million years old, while the Meliponini (and thus the clade {{that includes the}} Bombini and Meliponini) are 81 to 96 million years old, {{about the same age}} as the corbiculate group.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, matter {{itself is}} {{expected}} to come {{under the influence of}} radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. Current <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> universe has a flat geometry (or very close to flat), and thus, will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.|$|E

5|$|Voalavo is a genus of rodent in the {{subfamily}} Nesomyinae, {{found only}} in Madagascar. Two species are known, both of which occur in mountain forest above 1250m (4100ft) altitude; the northern voalavo lives in northern Madagascar and eastern voalavo is restricted to a small area in {{the central part of}} the island. The genus was discovered in 1994 and formally described in 1998. Within Nesomyinae, it is most closely related to the genus Eliurus, and DNA sequence <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> current definitions of these two genera need to be changed.|$|E

25|$|Industry {{contributes}} a {{large portion}} of Karachi's economy, with the city home to several of Pakistan's largest companies dealing in textiles, cement, steel, heavy machinery, chemicals, and food products. The city is home to approximately 30 percent of Pakistan's manufacturing sector, and produces approximately 42 percent of Pakistan's value added in large scale manufacturing. At least 4500 industrial units form Karachi's formal industrial economy. Karachi's informal manufacturing sector employs far more people than the formal sector, though proxy <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> capital employed and value added from such informal enterprises is far smaller than that offormal sector enterprises.|$|E
25|$|High {{levels of}} {{inflation}} {{have also been}} associated with a growth in Iran's money supply. The Central Bank's <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> money supply growth has been about 40% annually. The rapid {{growth of money supply}} came from high demands for borrowing capital at the rate of 12% the banks offer, imposed by the Government to make credit accessible to average Iranians and small entrepreneurs. However, this rate is lower than the rate of inflation. This makes the cost of borrowing less than free market cost as determined by supply and demand, based on the inflation rate and investment risk.|$|E

25|$|Machado–Joseph disease (MJD) is a triplet repeat disease {{characterized}} by cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal signs, ophthalmoplegia, and polyneuropathy. Since muscle cramps are a frequent occurrence in MJD, axonal hyperexcitability {{has been considered}} {{to play a role}} in the disease. Research has demonstrated that the strength-duration time constant in MJD patients is significantly longer than in controls, and this corresponds to a significant reduction in rheobase. Combined with findings on Na+ channel blockers, these <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cramps in MJD are likely caused by the increased persistent Na+ channel conductance that may be unregulated during axonal reinnervation (which results from long-term axonal degeneration).|$|E
25|$|The endocannabinoid system {{appears to}} play a {{significant}} role in the mechanism of action of clinically effective and potential antidepressants and may serve as a target for drug design and discovery. The endocannabinoid-induced modulation of stress-related behaviors appears to be mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of the serotoninergic system, by which cannabinoid CB1 receptors modulate the excitability of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons. <b>Data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> endocannabinoid system in cortical and subcortical structures is differentially altered in an animal model of depression and that the effects of chronic, unpredictable stress (CUS) on CB1 receptor binding site density are attenuated by antidepressant treatment while those on endocannabinoid content are not.|$|E
25|$|From {{the point}} of view of human archaeology, it falls in the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods. When the {{glaciation}} event started, Homo sapiens were confined to lower lattitudes and used tools comparable to those used by Neanderthals in western and central Eurasia and by Homo erectus in Asia. Near the end of the event, Homo sapiens invaded Eurasia and Australia. Archaeological and genetic <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> source populations of Paleolithic humans survived the last glacial period in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest cover. The retreat of the glaciers 15,000 years ago allowed groups of humans from Asia to migrate to the Americas.|$|E

25|$|Humankind {{gradually}} {{evolved from}} early {{members of the}} genus Homo—such as Homo habilis, who used simple stone tools—into fully behaviorally and anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) during the Paleolithic era. During {{the end of the}} Paleolithic, specifically the Middle and or Upper Paleolithic, humans began to produce the earliest works of art and engage in religious and spiritual behavior such as burial and ritual. The climate during the Paleolithic consisted of a set of glacial and interglacial periods in which the climate periodically fluctuated between warm and cool temperatures. Archaeological and genetic <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> source populations of Paleolithic humans survived in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest cover.|$|E
25|$|Phenotypic {{and genetic}} <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> red {{imported}} fire ant {{and the black}} imported fire ant (Solenopsis richteri) differ from each other, but they do share a close genetic relationship. Hybridisation between the two ants occurs in areas where they make contact, with the hybrid zone located in Mississippi. Such hybridisation has resulted from secondary contact between these two ants several decades ago, when they first encountered each other in southern Alabama. Based on mitochondrial DNA, examined haplotypes do not form a monophyletic clade. Some of the examined haplotypes form a closer relationship to S. megergates, S. quinquecuspis and S. richteri than they do with other S. invicta haplotypes. The occurrence of a possible paraphyletic grouping suggests that the red imported fire ant and S. quinquecuspis are possible cryptic species groups composed of several species that cannot be distinguished morphologically.|$|E
25|$|Modern humans spread rapidly from Africa {{into the}} {{frost-free}} zones of Europe and Asia around 60,000 years ago. The {{rapid expansion of}} humankind to North America and Oceania {{took place at the}} climax of the most recent ice age, when temperate regions of today were extremely inhospitable. Yet, humans had colonized nearly all the ice-free parts of the globe {{by the end of the}} Ice Age, some 12,000 years ago. Other hominids such as Homo erectus had been using simple wood and stone tools for millennia, but as time progressed, tools became far more refined and complex. Perhaps as early as 1.8 million years ago, but certainly by 500,000 years ago, humans began using fire for heat and cooking. They also developed language in the Paleolithic period and a conceptual repertoire that included systematic burial of the dead and adornment of the living. Early artistic expression can be found in the form of cave paintings and sculptures made from ivory, stone, and bone, showing a spirituality generally interpreted as animism, or even shamanism. During this period, all humans lived as hunter-gatherers, and were generally nomadic. Archaeological and genetic <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> source populations of Paleolithic hunter-gatherers survived in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest cover.|$|E

500|$|Fortuitously, Cassini {{flew through}} this gas cloud during the July 14 encounter, {{allowing}} instruments {{such as the}} ion and neutral mass spectrometer (INMS) and the cosmic dust analyzer (CDA) to directly sample the plume.

500|$|The {{original}} {{model for}} how the respiratory chain complexes are organized was that they diffuse freely and independently in the mitochondrial membrane. However, recent <b>data</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> complexes might form higher-order structures called supercomplexes or [...] "respirasomes". In this model, the various complexes exist as organized sets of interacting enzymes. These associations might allow channeling of substrates between the various enzyme complexes, increasing the rate and efficiency of electron transfer. Within such mammalian supercomplexes, some components would be present in higher amounts than others, with some data suggesting a ratio between complexes I/II/III/IV and the ATP synthase of approximately 1:1:3:7:4. However, the debate over this supercomplex hypothesis is not completely resolved, as some data {{do not appear to}} fit with this model.|$|E
