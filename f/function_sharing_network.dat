40|$|Inspired by {{multifunctional}} {{neural networks}} in biological brain, {{this paper is}} concerned with building multifunctional learning ability for artificial neural networks. A multiagent based evolutionary artificial neural network with lifetime learning (MENL) is used to learn two kinds of navigation abilities together: to explore unknown environments {{as far as possible}} and to reach designated goals in the environments. Because these two <b>functions</b> <b>share</b> the same <b>network</b> mechanism and the common knowledge about subject behavior decision and environmental information processing, the learning of one function can benefit the learning of another. This concept has been demonstrated by satisfactory experimental results. Detailed discussion has concluded that the strategies of evolutionary multiagents and lifetime learning used in MENL are beneficial to the successful multifunctional learning of MENL. 1 Introduction As the understanding of brain mechanism has increased, multifunctional neural ne [...] ...|$|R

We {{focus on the}} fact that it takes a significant number of users to saturate a link, ne-cessitating the inclusion of individual rate constraints. In particular we extend work of Reed & Zwart on fluid models of bandwidth sharing with rate constraints under Markovian assumptions: we consider a bandwidth <b>sharing</b> <b>network</b> with rate constraints, where job sizes and deadlines have a general joint distribution. We introduce a fluid model and investi-gate several of its properties. In particular we show that its invariant point approximates the invariant distribution of the bandwidth <b>sharing</b> <b>network</b> if capacities are large...|$|R

40|$|Unauthorized copying {{of movies}} {{is a major}} concern for the motion picture industry. While {{unauthorized}} copies of movies have been distributed via portable physical media for some time, low-cost, high-bandwidth Internet connections and peer-topeer file <b>sharing</b> <b>networks</b> provide highly efficient distribution media. Many movies are showing up on file <b>sharing</b> <b>networks</b> shortly after, and in some cases prior to, theatrical release. It has been argued that the availability of unauthorized copies directly affects theater attendance and DVD sales, and hence represents a major financial threat to the movie industry. Our research attempts to determine the source of unauthorized copies by studying the availability and characteristics of recent popular movies in file <b>sharing</b> <b>networks.</b> We developed a data set of 312 popular movies and located one or more samples of 183 of these movies on file <b>sharing</b> <b>networks,</b> for a total of 285 movie samples. 77 % of these samples appear to have been leaked by industry insiders. Most of our samples appeared on file <b>sharing</b> <b>networks</b> prior to their official consumer DVD release date. Indeed, of the movies that had been released on DVD as of the time of our study, only 5 % first appeared after their DVD release date on a web site that indexes file <b>sharing</b> <b>networks,</b> indicating that consumer DVD copying currently represents a relatively minor factor compared with insider leaks. We perform a brief analysis of the movie production and distribution process and identify potential security vulnerabilities that may lead to unauthorized copies becom...|$|R
