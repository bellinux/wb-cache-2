5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> change my life.|$|E
500|$|In a September 3, 2000 1211 {{win over}} the Baltimore Orioles, Lofton tied a MLB record {{previously}} held by Red Rolfe when he scored in [...] 18 consecutive games. The winning margin was provided by Lofton's 13th-inning home run and in the game he tied an Indians' franchise single-game record with five stolen bases. He finished the 2000 season batting [...]278, recording 30 stolen bases and 107 runs (the sixth time crossing home plate 100 times or more in nine seasons). The Indians finished the regular season 9072 and one game out of the wild card. After missing the post-season in 2000, the Indians returned in 2001 after winning the AL Central with a 9171 regular season record. Before winning the division, however, Lofton scored the game-winning run during an August 5 game against the Seattle Mariners;the Indians were down by 12 runs, and became just the third team in MLB history to overcome such a deficit, winning 1514 in 11 innings. Indians catcher Eddie Taubensee, {{who was involved in}} the trade which sent Lofton from Houston to Cleveland {{at the beginning of his}} major league career, caught Lofton after he slid into home plate and jumped with excitement after discovering he had just scored the game-winning run. [...] "I caught him and wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> go", Taubensee said. Cleveland won that game against Seattle but lost their match-up with the 116-win Mariners in the 2001 ALDS. He hit 66 RBIs on the regular season (second-most in his career) but failed to record 20 stolen bases for the first time in his major league career and batted a career-low [...]261. Lofton had been treated for a rib cage problem that had impacted his play before the All-Star break. His second stint with Cleveland lasted through 2001 in which his salary was for $8 million in his final contract year with the club. He became a free agent following the conclusion of the season.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{said after}} the fight [...] "Bruno did his {{homework}} and kept me from throwing my right hand early... but he must have forgotten I have a terrific left hook. I said to myself, 'I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> see my hook'". Bruno's manager, Mickey Duff, said [...] "Frank (Bruno) has no chin... once he gets hit clean on the button, he goes".|$|E

2500|$|Having seen Nixon's remarks, Brown {{was quoted}} as stating [...] "That's {{something}} Nixon's going to regret all his life. The press is never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> forget it." [...] As described in his obituary in The New York Times, Nixon's farewell-to-politics speech made him {{appear to be a}} sore loser violating a cardinal rule of U.S. politics, so that it seemed to indicate [...] "that his political career was over".|$|E
2500|$|On {{his journey}} Anderson {{is haunted by}} dreams of his father's murder as a child. He recalls that while the two were camping out in the wild, an unknown assailant shot his father in his sleep, but left young James alive, telling him [...] "to keep that fear , kid". After {{questioning}} more and more outlaws, Anderson is confronted by Dr. Death in an old mine. Anderson eventually gets the drop on him; he gets tangled up in a rope above a deep mine shaft. Dr. Death tells him that his daughter is hidden in an old Indian cliff village. After finding out that Anderson is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> out of the pit, he teases Anderson about {{the murder of his}} wife. Anderson is enraged and puts his cigar in the pulley from which the rope is hanging, eventually burning up the rope and sending Dr. Death plummeting to his demise {{at the bottom of the}} shaft.|$|E
2500|$|Asquith {{was one of}} {{five people}} given a free pass by the Coalition but the East Fife Unionist Association defied {{national}} instructions and put up a candidate, Sprot, against him. Sprot was refused a Coalition [...] "coupon." [...] Asquith assumed his own seat would be safe and spent only two and half days there, speaking only to closed meetings; in one speech there on 11 December he conceded {{that he did not}} want to [...] "displace" [...] the current government. He scoffed at press rumours that he was being barracked by a gang of discharged soldiers. Postwar reconstruction, the desire for harsh peace terms, and Asquith's desire to attend the peace talks, were campaign issues, with posters asking: [...] "Asquith nearly lost you the War. Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> spoil the Peace?" [...] James Scott, his chairman at East Fife, wrote of [...] "a swarm of women going from door to door indulging in a slander for which they had not a shadow of proof. This was used for such a purpose as to influence the female vote very much against you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You think there's something? You don't believe I've {{come up for}} {{rest over}} Sunday?

There is something. Think of {{the worst thing you}} can, Cynthy!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Fitzpiers, now {{thoroughly}} excited, was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> {{her escape}} <b>him</b> thus. He approached, {{and set about}} turning over the heaps one by one.

5000|$|A {{couple months}} later, Canadian Greg Schlosser drew Bodacious in San Antonio, Texas. He recalls Cody Lambert's warning, [...] "I don’t {{want to scare}} you or nothin’, but that bull {{is one of the}} baddest son of a guns I’ve ever been on." [...] Since Greg had flown all the way from Calgary, Alberta, Canada, he wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> that stop <b>him.</b> He made the whistle and 82 points on Bodacious.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, mother." [...] Then, after a moment, she said, with a rush: [...] "Did {{you think}} I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> suppose we were piqued at his not coming? Did you suppose I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> patronize us, or {{think that we}} were in the least {{dependent}} on his favor or friendship?" ...|$|E

50|$|Bow was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> {{anything}} stop <b>him</b> {{from pursuing}} his dream {{and goals of}} becoming the best mixed martial artists that he could be. He {{was able to find}} other professional MMA organizations that would allow him to strive towards his goals. Bow became a veteran in a handful of other organizations known as Shooto, BodogFight and DEEP where he tallied up more victories and recognition. While participating in these three organizations, Bow opened up his own gym from 2005-2009 called Kaminari Dojo Mixed Martial Arts Academy.|$|R
60|$|JUDITH. You {{must not}} ask {{questions}} about him, Essie. You {{are too young to}} {{know what it is to}} be a bad man. But he is a smuggler; and he lives with gypsies; and he has no love for his mother and his family; and he wrestles and plays games on Sunday instead of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> church. Never <b>let</b> <b>him</b> into your presence, if you can help it, Essie; and try to keep yourself and all womanhood unspotted by contact with such men.|$|R
6000|$|In his chilly cot, {{turning from}} aching side to side, he pondered of Tanis. [...] "He'd been {{a fool to}} lose her. He had to have {{somebody}} he could really talk to. He'd--oh, he'd BUST if he went on stewing about things by himself. And Myra, useless to expect her to understand. Well, rats, no use dodging the issue. Darn shame for two married people to drift apart after all these years; darn rotten shame; but nothing could bring them together now, {{as long as he}} refused <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Zenith bully <b>him</b> into taking orders--and he was by golly not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> anybody bully <b>him</b> into anything, or wheedle him or coax him either!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, don't be nonsensical," [...] she said. [...] "Your father isn't {{the only}} man married to a woman not as clever as himself. He isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> that stop <b>him.</b> And your mother's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> learn to be {{the wife of a}} great man and do the best she can. And if they don't like her they've got to put up with her. I shall talk to the both of them." [...] A wave of motherliness towards the entire Phillips family passed over her. It {{included}} Hilda. She caught the child to her and gave her a hug. [...] "You go back to school," [...] she said, [...] "and get on as fast as you can, so that you'll be able to be useful to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But my life isn't {{for you to}} give to others, {{and your}} life is mine, and I think I have some right to say what shall be done with it, and I don't choose to have it used up on old Hilbrook." [...] It passed through Ewbert's languid thought, which it stirred to a vague amusement, that {{the son of an}} older church than the Rixonite might have found in this {{thoroughly}} terrestrial attitude of his wife a potent argument for sacerdotal celibacy; but he did not attempt to formulate it, and he listened submissively while she went on: [...] "One thing: I am certainly not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> you see <b>him</b> again till you've seen the doctor, and I hope he won't come about. If he does, I shall see him." ...|$|R
5000|$|On January 9, 2009, Patterson was {{the lone}} House vote (114-1) against impeaching Governor Rod Blagojevich on {{corruption}} charges and committing abuses of power. In the roll call, Patterson said he didn't feel {{it was his job}} to vote to impeach the governor. He declined to comment on whether he approved of Blagojevich's performance. Patterson defended his vote against impeachment by stating that [...] "I have no firsthand knowledge of any of the evidence," [...] "I went by my own gut feeling, as simple as that," [...] and also that [...] "I read the report. If the government is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> indict <b>him,</b> <b>let</b> them go ahead and do that. That's their job and I'm doing my job." ...|$|R

40|$|Look, {{there he}} is!" Andy shouted to his sister. Lynne dropped the beach ball {{and ran to}} the end of the short drive.

"We're just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the playground, Dad," shouted Lynne. "Okay, but don't speak to any strangers - and no more than half an hour. It's almost bed time. " Breathless, the two children arrived at the open space. Where had he gone? Lynne was shivering. The sea breeze was a little cool. But he wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> that bother <b>him.</b> "There!" called Lynne suddenly. She was pointing to the path which lead to the main road. That was him again - dressed all in red and making his way along the path which lead to the main road. "Come on. race you," shouted Andy...|$|R
5000|$|Veach {{left the}} {{hospital}} {{and went to the}} county jail to interview Jean Delaney. He asked her if she had a message to take back to Carroll. [...] "Tell him that I said not to die and that they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> me see <b>him</b> in the hospital. Tell him that I love him. He was always good and kind to me, and the things they say about him aren't true. We just stopped in Waterloo to get my glasses fitted." [...] Veach told her he would deliver the message. When he arrived back at the hospital, he learned that Carroll had died just before he got there, about six p.m. He returned to the jail and told Delaney that her message had been delivered, [...] "thinking it might soften the blow somewhat." [...] Two days after Carroll's death Delaney was sentenced to a year and a day for violating her parole, and later miscarried their child. Carroll was given a Catholic funeral at the Church of the Assumption in St. Paul and was buried in Oakland Cemetery, St. Paul, Lot 279, Block 71. Carroll's grave marker has long been missing.|$|R

50|$|Benson, Halstead and Lindsay {{go back to}} {{the center}} to pick up Turner for questioning. He tries to run from them, and in the ensuing {{struggle}} Lindsay is injured by a passing bicyclist and hospitalized. When she awakes, Voight is at her bedside, telling her to go back to Chicago and vowing to help Teddy. Voight later shows up at SVU and immediately bursts into the interrogation room, where Amaro and Rollins are trying to question Turner. Voight threatens Turner, causing Benson to intervene; she threatens to have Voight arrested if he touches Turner again. However, Benson lets Turner believe that she is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Voight hurt <b>him</b> in order to scare him into revealing what he knows. Turner tells them some details involving toll fees that their prime suspect had to pay in order {{to get back into the}} city. Voight and Benson go to Teddy, who still refuses to remember that part of his life, so they go back to Jocelyn, undercover as Henry's parents in order to get her to talk. They take her back to SVU, where the detectives put her in an interrogation room with Teddy and a live feed of Henry. She remembers that they drove her across a long bridge, that she was blindfolded, and that she heard the sound of tires on metal. She and Teddy also remember a name: Bob Clinton (Mark H. Dold).|$|R
