World War I saw {{the development of the}} flamethrower, a modern version of the Byzantine siphons, which used gas under pressure to squirt a mixture of <b>inflammable</b> oil and petrol, ignited by a burning taper. Similarly, the carcass projectile found new use in the Livens Projector, a primitive mortar that could throw a large canister of <b>inflammable</b> liquid (it was soon used for poison gas instead).|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{warships}} of Antiquity, Byzantine and Arab ships did not feature rams, and {{the primary}} means of ship-to-ship combat were boarding actions and missile fire, {{as well as the}} use of <b>inflammable</b> materials such as Greek fire. Despite the fearsome reputation of the latter, it was only effective under certain circumstances, and not the decisive anti-ship weapon that the ram had been in the hands of experienced crews.|$|E
40|$|A {{literature}} {{survey was conducted}} to determine the relation between aircraft ignition sources and <b>inflammables.</b> Available literature applicable {{to the problem of}} aircraft fire hazards is analyzed and discussed. Data pertaining to the effect of many variables on ignition temperatures, minimum ignition pressures, minimum spark-ignition energies of <b>inflammables,</b> quenching distances of electrode configurations, and size of openings through which flame will not propagate are presented and discussed. Ignition temperatures and limits of inflammability of gasoline in air in different test environments, and the minimum ignition pressures and minimum size of opening for flame propagation in gasoline-air mixtures are included; inerting of gasoline-air mixtures is discussed...|$|R

60|$|We are to remark, however, {{that of all}} districts, this of Bouille's {{seems the}} <b>inflammablest.</b> It was always to Bouille and Metz that Royalty would fly: Austria lies near; here more than {{elsewhere}} must the disunited People look over the borders, into a dim sea of Foreign Politics and Diplomacies, with hope or apprehension, with mutual exasperation.|$|R
5|$|Billiard balls {{have been}} made from many {{different}} materials {{throughout the history of}} the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, Bakelite, crystalate, and phenolic resin, polyester and acrylic) and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid billiard balls, invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile and highly <b>inflammable,</b> sometimes exploding during manufacture.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of 1978, they toured with the Tom Robinson Band, and in 1979, they {{released}} their first album on the Rough Trade Label, <b>Inflammable</b> Material. The band signed a contract with Island Records, but it fell through, leaving the band to release the album on their existing label. Despite the album's independent release, it reached number 14 in the UK Albums Chart and reached Silver status, selling over 100,000 copies. <b>Inflammable</b> Material was the first album distributed by Rough Trade records, and the first independent album to chart in the UK.|$|E
25|$|Fires {{start when}} a <b>inflammable</b> or a {{combustible}} material, {{in combination with}} a sufficient quantity of an oxidizer such as oxygen gas or another oxygen-rich compound (though non-oxygen oxidizers exist), is exposed to a source of heat or ambient temperature above the flash point for the fuel/oxidizer mix, {{and is able to}} sustain a rate of rapid oxidation that produces a chain reaction. This is commonly called the fire tetrahedron. Fire cannot exist without all of these elements in place and in the right proportions. For example, an <b>inflammable</b> liquid will start burning only if the fuel and oxygen are in the right proportions. Some fuel-oxygen mixes may require a catalyst, a substance that is not consumed, when added, in any chemical reaction during combustion, but which enables the reactants to combust more readily.|$|E
50|$|Although {{most of the}} {{buildings}} that were on site during the Second World War have been removed, those remaining are indicative {{of the types of}} buildings and facilities constructed and which were necessary for the operation of a wartime air base. These include a hangar, flight office, field hospital, parachute packing shed, motor transport garage, <b>inflammables</b> store and latrines. In conjunction with wartime records and plans these buildings demonstrate the function of the aerodrome.|$|R
60|$|Cuban scouts {{reported}} to Colonel Huntington on Guantanamo Bay that {{the streets of}} Caimanera have been covered with straw saturated in oil, in order that the city may be destroyed when the Americans evince any disposition to take possession.

Of course, suspended from the rings, are the illuminators, and when they have run down the stays fifty feet the lines will automatically bring them to rest. Then all the main deck between the poop and the mizzen-mast will be flooded with light, while we shall be in comparative darkness.|$|R
25|$|Prosecutor General's {{technical}} juridical expertise, released {{three months}} after the fire, revealed that no control of Sector 4's City Hall took place in five years.

Civil Aviation elected to retain the hospital, motor transport garages, two hangars, a flight office, a workshop, store, <b>inflammables</b> store and two latrines. One of the hangars was later removed, though most of the selected buildings remain on site. Some concrete slabs and other traces of RAAF buildings can still be seen dotted about the airport. The runways have been resurfaced and the third cross strip existing during the war has gone. The tree lined entrance drive is still the main access to the airport.|$|R
60|$|Let the Reader confess too that, {{taking one}} thing with another, perhaps few {{terrestrial}} Appearances are better worth considering than mobs. Your mob {{is a genuine}} outburst of Nature; issuing from, or communicating with, the deepest deep of Nature.

Such a Complex of human Forces and Individualities hurled forth, in their transcendental mood, to act and react, on circumstances and on one another; to work {{out what it is}} in them to work.

60|$|For {{it is with}} Bouille as {{with all}} French Commanding Officers; only in a more {{emphatic}} degree. The grand National Federation, we already guess, was but empty sound, or worse: a last loudest universal Hep-hep-hurrah, with full bumpers, in that National Lapithae-feast of Constitution-making; as in loud denial of the palpably existing; as if, with hurrahings, you would shut out notice of the inevitable already knocking at the gates! Which new National bumper, one may say, can but deepen the drunkenness; and so, the louder it swears Brotherhood, will the sooner and the more surely lead to Cannibalism. Ah, under that fraternal shine and clangour, what a deep world of irreconcileable discords lie momentarily assuaged, damped down for one moment! Respectable military Federates have barely got home to their quarters; and the <b>inflammablest,</b> 'dying, burnt up with liquors, and kindness,' has not yet got extinct; the shine is hardly out of men's eyes, and still blazes filling all men's memories,--when your discords burst forth again very considerably darker than ever. Let us look at Bouille, and see how.|$|R
25|$|A study {{conducted}} by the Gujarat Forensic Science Laboratory report states that 60 liters of <b>inflammable</b> liquid had been poured into coach S-6 of the train using a wide mouthed container.

The report also concluded that there had been heavy stone pelting on the train.|$|E
25|$|This fire {{is made by}} the {{following}} arts. From the pine and the certain such evergreen trees <b>inflammable</b> resin is collected. This is rubbed with sulfur and put into tubes of reed, and is blown by men using it with violent and continuous breath. Then in this manner it meets the fire on the tip and catches light and falls like a fiery whirlwind {{on the faces of}} the enemies. At the same time, the reports by Western chroniclers of the famed ignis graecus are largely unreliable, since they apply the name to any and all sorts of incendiary substances.|$|E
25|$|Developed under Johann Joachim Becher and Georg Ernst Stahl, phlogiston {{theory was}} an attempt to account for {{products}} of combustion. According to the theory, a substance called phlogiston was released from <b>inflammable</b> materials through burning. The resulting product was termed calx, which was considered a 'dephlogisticated' substance in its 'true' form. The first strong evidence against phlogiston theory came from pneumatic chemists in Britain during the later half of the 18th century. Joseph Black, Joseph Priestley and Henry Cavendish all identified different gases that composed air; however, it was not until Antoine Lavoisier discovered in the fall of 1772 that, when burned, sulphur and phosphorus “gain in weight” that the phlogiston theory began to unravel.|$|E
50|$|Friedrichstadt was {{severely}} damaged in the widespread destruction which accompanied World War II, {{especially in the}} first area bombardment organised and {{carried out by the}} United States Air Force on the morning of February 3, 1945. The bombs consisted mostly of <b>inflammables,</b> hardly explosives. The bombing was so dense that it caused a city fire spreading eastwards, driven by the wind, over the centre and south of Friedrichstadt and the northwest of neighboured Luisenstadt. The fire lasted for four days until it had burnt everything combustible in its range to ashes and after it had reached waterways, and large thoroughfares, parks and the like over which the fire could not jump any further. Many of the historic buildings in the neighbourhood were so badly damaged that they had to be condemned or torn down. The construction of the Berlin Wall directly through the neighbourhood brought only more destruction. In the northern portion of the neighbourhood, which lay within the boundaries of Mitte Borough, which was part of East Berlin, systematic rebuilding began in 1970. Along Leipzig Street, which had been almost completely flattened, high-rise apartment buildings were constructed. In the southern half of Friedrichstadt, which was located in the West Berlin borough of Kreuzberg, a more historically accurate reconstruction of the neighbourhood occurred. The neighbourhood was reconstructed, block by block, according to the original street plan, in a historically accurate manner.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, Gameforge founded {{its first}} foreign branch, Gameforge SARL, {{established}} in Paris. After buying French development studio Nevrax, the subsidiary was commissioned {{to market the}} game “The Saga of Ryzom”. It was only a moderate success, leading to the sale of Ryzom in 2009. Gameforge owned other offices abroad, including Gameforge Holding Malta Ltd. with headquarters in Pietà. In November 2007, Gameforge ventured into the U.S. market as the first German online games company and founded Gameforge Productions Inc. based in San Francisco. Lars Koschin was placed in charge of branch management overseas.On April 23, 2008, Gameforge announced the establishment of four development studios. “Ticking Bomb Games”, based in Hamburg, was to develop several PC games, then be marketed by Gameforge. Managing directors were Tobias Severin and Marco Schultz; who both already had many {{years of experience in}} the game development field. Ralf C. Adam was introduced as a consultant, allowing them to make use of his 16 years’ professional experience. Their first game, Gilde1400, a browser game based on PC game “The Guild”, was released late October 2009. The beta phase ran for two weeks before it was published.The end of January 2009 brought the establishment of the second developer, “Rough Sea Games”, based in Mannheim, Germany. Just like Ticking Bomb, the studio was to take over development of PC and browser games. Matthias Schindler was elected CEO. He had been working in the game development for 15 years.In addition to the Hamburg and Mannheim studios, the company also co-operated with two other development studios: “Steroid Interactive” (Mainz) and “Inflammables” (Heidelberg). All four studios were gradually decommissioned: the offices in Hamburg, Mainz and Mannheim were sold on 1 January 2011; <b>Inflammables</b> closed with the end of Hellbreed in late 2011.At the end of 2008, the foundation of a subsidiary in the United States together with Frogster Interactive Pictures AG was unveiled. Gameforge was to be the primary stakeholder with 75 percent and following the purchase of 470,000 shares it was to then have acquired a stake of up to 20 percent from Frogster. However this joint venture was not achieved: conflicts of interest arose regarding the details. The company chose instead to become active with its own subsidiary, Frogster America Inc.|$|R
5000|$|Only one {{sabotage}} {{mission is}} known to have been launched in England. Sometime after his arrival in Paris, Silas Deane was visited by a young man named James Aitken, recently returned from America. Aitken produced crudely drawn but accurate plans of the Royal Navy Dockyards in England and proposed to sabotage them by utilizing a unique incendiary device of his own design. Deane engaged his services and issued Aitken a passport signed by French Foreign Minister Vergennes with instructions to French officials: [...] "We will and command you very expressly to let pass safely and freely, Mr. James Actzen, going to England, without giving him or suffering him any hindrance; but on the contrary giving every aid and assistance that he shall want or occasion for." [...] In late November 1776, Aitken landed at Dover, and on December 7 he ignited a fire at the Portsmouth dockyard that burned from late in the afternoon until the following morning, destroying twenty tons of hemp, ten one-hundred-fathom (183 m) cables, and six tons of ship cordage. After failing to penetrate the security at Plymouth, Aitken proceeded to Bristol, where he destroyed two warehouses and several houses. On January 16, 1777, the British cabinet met in emergency session and urged immediate measures to locate the mysterious [...] "John the Painter" [...] (Aitken was a house painter). Guards were augmented at all military facilities and arsenals, and a reward was posted. By January 20 the cabinet, again in extraordinary session, discussed suspending habeas corpus and placing the country under martial law. Five days later the reward was increased to one thousand pounds, and newspapers reported panic throughout England. Aitken was soon apprehended, with a pistol and <b>inflammables</b> in his possession. He would not admit to the sabotage when interrogated, but eventually confided in a friendly American visitor who was secretly in the pay of the British. Based on these confidences, personal effects, including the passport from Vergennes, were located. His trial was speedy, and on March 10, 1777, Aitken went to the gallows at Portsmouth Dockyard, where his exploits had begun.|$|R

25|$|Sipsop the Pythagorean – Geoffrey Keynes {{suggests}} that Sipsop {{is based on}} the neoplatonist Thomas Taylor with whose work Blake was familiar. Keynes is supported in this by Alicia Ostriker. However, David V. Erdman, disputes this theory and instead {{suggests that}} Sipsop is based on William Henry Mathew, eldest son of Anthony Stephen Mathew. Erdman bases this argument on the fact that William Henry was apprenticed to the surgeon John Hunter, who is represented in An Island by Jack Tearguts, to whom Sipsop is apprenticed. On the other hand, Nancy Bogen believes that Sipsop is based on John Abernethy. Sipsop is often posited as representing the science rejected by Suction, but Damon argues this cannot be so, as such science is represented by <b>Inflammable</b> Gass. To Damon's mind, this leaves Sipsop with something of an undefined role. As a Pythagorean, Sipsop is ideologically the opposite of Suction the Epicurean; Pythagoreanism embraces the mysticism that Epicureanism explicitly rejects.|$|E
25|$|The Philippine Department Air Force {{was formed}} on 6 May 1941 as the War Department hastily {{reversed}} course {{and attempted to}} upgrade its air defenses in the Philippines. The general officer requested by Grunert arrived on May 4 {{in the person of}} , who had just completed a three-week air defense course taught at Mitchel Field, New York, to familiarize him with the concepts of integrating Signal Corps radars, radio communications, and interceptor forces. Marshall had also given Clagett a top-secret mission to go to China in mid-May for a month of observation and assessment of Japanese tactics. The PDAF's only major unit, the 4th Composite Group, consisted of five squadrons based at two grass fields: Clark and Nichols. A third airfield, Nielson Field, lacked facilities and was used primarily as an administrative strip for nearby Fort McKinley. An isolated sod auxiliary strip at Iba on the west coast was used for gunnery training. PDAF's materiel was centrally located in the Philippine Air Depot at Nichols Field, easily targeted from the air and highly <b>inflammable.</b> The only existing antiaircraft defenses were a single battery of four 3-inch gun M1903 guns and a searchlight platoon at Fort Wint at the entrance to Subic Bay, which would only be marginally reinforced in September.|$|E
40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{are widely}} used as flame retardants in <b>inflammables</b> to ensure the life and property safety by decreasing the risk of fire accidents. PBDEs have been detected in human, wildlife, marine, and freshwater sediments. PBDEs become important environmental organic pollutants but the degradation studies of PBDEs in the environment are still limited. In this study, the chemical debromination of DBDE (Decabrominated diphenyl ether) by zero-valent iron (ZVI) was studied. A scanning electron microscopy and a photon correlation spectroscopy were performed to characterize the surface properties and particle size of nanoscale ZVI, respectively. The nanoscale ZVI existed as spherical particles averaging 20 ~ 50 nm in diameter and its surface area was 52. 0 m 2 /g. Within 40 minutes over 80 % of DBDE was transformed into lower bromo congeners by nanoscale ZVI under ambient conditions. During the initial reaction period (< 20 minutes), nonabromo BDEs were the most abundant products but hexa to heptabromo congeners were dominant after 130 minutes. The effects of particle sizes of zero-valent iron, temperature (5, 25, and 45 ℃), pH value (5, 7, 8, and 10), {{and the existence of}} inorganic anions (Cl-, HCO 3 -, and H 2 PO 4 -) and cations (Na+, Cu 2 +, and Fe 3 +) in solutions on the dehalogenation were evaluated. For nanoscale ZVI, the pseudo-first-order DBDE debromination rate constant (0. 0583 min- 1) was significantly faster than that of microscale ZVI (0. 0077 min- 1) due to the higher surface area and reactivity of nanoscale iron particles. The debromination rate constants of DBDE increased with the decreasing of aqueous pH values and with the increase of temperature. For anions, a high concentration of chloride ions enhanced the debromination of DBDE, whereas phosphate and carbonate ions hindered the debromination process. The cation species also affected the reduction reaction by ZVI except Na+. The debromination rate constants of DBDE increased in the presence of Cu 2 + and decreased in the presence of Fe 3 +. Lugang and Longgang soil solutions and Lugang and Longgang soils were chose as soil systems to evaluate the debromination rate of DBDE by nanoscale ZVI. The reduction rates of DBDE by nanoscale ZVI in soil solutions and soils were slower than those in pure water. Comparing the reaction rates between Longgang and Lugang soils, the reduction rate of DBDE in Longgang soil was faster than that in Lugang soil probably due to the lower pH of Loggang soil. The debromination pathway of DBDE by nanoscale ZVI was proposed via the analysis of byproducts. Nanoscale ZVI has the high potential values to remediate PBDEs in the environment. 多溴聯苯醚過去廣泛應用在易燃的工業製品上以降低其起火燃燒的可能性及保障人類生命財產的安全。過去已在人體，野生動物，自然水體以及底泥中檢測到多溴聯苯醚的存在，且其在環境中以及人類食物中的濃度都有隨時間上升的趨勢，而歐盟因此自 2003 年起就全面禁止了部份多溴聯苯醚物種的使用。 本研究以化學還原處理的方式來對十溴聯苯醚進行試驗。本實驗以化學還原法所自行合成之奈米零價鐵作為反應物，經掃描式電子顯微鏡(scanning electron microscopy) 以及雷射粒徑分析儀(photon correlation spectroscopy) 測定後得知其直徑介於 20 ~ 50 nm。經BET比表面積分析得知其比表面積為 52. 0 m 2 /g。本實驗的結果顯示，DBDE經奈米零價鐵處理 40 分鐘後就超過 80 % 的降解效率。反應初期(< 20 分鐘) ，含九溴的物種為主要的產物，而六溴以及七溴的產物在零價鐵反應 130 分鐘後已逐漸取代九溴的物種。本實驗亦探討零價鐵粒徑大小的影響、污染物濃度效應、溫渡(5 、 25 、以及 50 ℃) 、以及pH值(pH 5 、 7 、 8 以及pH 10) 對奈米零價鐵還原處理DBDE之影響。結果顯示，由於奈米零價鐵的顆粒小且比表面積大，有助於還原反應的進行，因此其反應速率常數(0. 0583 min- 1) 較為微米零價鐵(0. 0077 min- 1) 來的大。結果亦指出奈米零價鐵的反應過程中會隨著系統pH值的下降其反應速率有上升的趨勢;對於溫度而言，提高系統反應溫度有助於加速反應。 本實驗選用各三種不同的陰離子(Cl-, HCO 3 -, and H 2 PO 4 -) 以及陽離子(Na+, Cu 2 +, and Fe 3 +) ，藉以探討溶液中離子的效應。就陰離子部份，結果顯示高濃度的氯離子(10 mM) 有助於加速奈米零價鐵還原降解DBDE的反應，反觀磷酸根以及碳酸氫根則使得反應過程受到阻礙。陽離子的部份除了鈉離子對於零價鐵的反應性沒有顯著的影響外，二價銅離子以及三價鐵離子分別對於奈米零價鐵有促進以及抑制的作用。本實驗亦以鹿港系與龍岡系之土壤溶液以及稀泥漿狀之土壤作為反應進行的系統。結果顯示不論是土壤溶液或是土壤，奈米零價鐵在其中的反應速率都較單純水溶液相來的差，且龍岡系土壤中奈米零價鐵對DBDE之降解反應速率較鹿港系土壤來的快。本實驗亦利用氣相層析儀分析產物並試圖推測出DBDE的降解反應的過程以釐清產物間彼此間的關係。摘要	iii Abstract	iii 目錄	v 圖目錄	vii 表目錄	ix 第ㄧ章 前言	 1 一、研究源起	 1 二、研究內容	 2 第二章 文獻回顧	 4 一、阻燃劑	 4 (一) 溴化阻燃劑	 5 (二) 十溴聯苯醚的製造與使用	 7 (三) 多溴聨苯醚之環境樣品濃度	 8 1. 非生物樣品	 8 2. 生物樣品	 9 3. 食物	 10 4. 人體組織	 11 (四) PBDE之轉化及分解	 11 (五) 對人體的健康與環境的威脅	 13 1. 多溴聨苯醚之毒性	 13 2. 毒性試驗	 14 二、零價金屬處理技術緣起與發展	 16 (一) 	奈米粒子簡介	 16 (二) 零價金屬之環境汙染復育	 17 (三) 零價鐵與有機化合物之反應機制	 18 (四) 奈米零價鐵應用於土壤及地下水之研究	 20 (五) 影響零價鐵去除有機污染物之因素	 23 1. pH值	 23 2. 溫度	 24 3. 陰陽離子	 25 第三章 材料與方法	 27 一、藥品	 27 二、土壤及土壤溶液性質及分析	 30 三、多溴聯苯醚萃取方法與分析條件建立	 31 四、奈米零價鐵之合成	 34 (一) 奈米零價鐵之表面特性及形態	 34 1. 掃描式電子顯微鏡觀測表面型態	 34 2.

6000|$|The {{money was}} far too much even for a fee in a fairy-tale, {{and in the absence}} of Mrs. Beale, who, though the hour was now late, had not yet {{returned}} to the Regent's Park, Susan Ash, in the hall, as loud as Maisie was low and as bold as she was bland, produced, on the exhibition offered under the dim vigil of the lamp that made the place a contrast to the child's recent scene of light, the half-crown that an unsophisticated cabman could pronounce to be the least he would take. It was apparently long before Mrs. Beale would arrive, and in the interval Maisie had been induced by the prompt Susan not only to go to bed like a darling dear, but, in still richer expression of that character, to devote to the repayment of obligations general as well as particular one of the sovereigns in the ordered array that, on the dressing-table upstairs, was naturally not less dazzling to a lone orphan of a housemaid than to the subject of the manoeuvres of a quartette. This subject went to sleep with her property gathered into a knotted handkerchief, the largest that could be produced and lodged under her pillow; but the explanations that on the morrow were inevitably more complete with Mrs. Beale than they had been with her humble friend found their climax in a surrender also more becomingly free. There were explanations indeed that Mrs. Beale had to give as well as to ask, and the most striking of these was to the effect that it was dreadful for a little girl to take money from a woman who was simply the vilest of their sex. The sovereigns were examined with some attention, the result of which, however, was to make the author of that statement desire to know what, if one really went into the matter, they could be called but the wages of sin. Her companion went into it merely so far as the question of what then they were to do with them; on which Mrs. Beale, who had by this time put them into her pocket, replied with dignity and with her hand on the place: [...] "We're to send them back on the spot!" [...] Susan, the child soon afterwards learnt, had been invited to contribute to this act of restitution her one appropriated coin; but a closer clutch of the treasure showed in her private assurance to Maisie that there was a limit to the way she could be [...] "done." [...] Maisie had been open with Mrs. Beale about the whole of last night's transaction; but she now found herself on the part of their indignant inferior a recipient of remarks that were so many ringing tokens of that lady's own suppressions. One of these bore upon the extraordinary hour--it was three in the morning if she really wanted to know--at which Mrs. Beale had re-entered the house; another, in accents as to which Maisie's criticism was still intensely tacit, characterised her appeal as such a [...] "gime," [...] such a [...] "shime," [...] as one had never had to put up with; a third treated with some vigour the question of the enormous sums due belowstairs, in every department, for gratuitous labour and wasted zeal. Our young lady's consciousness was indeed mainly filled for several days with the apprehension created by the too slow subsidence of her attendant's sense of wrong. These days would become terrific like the Revolutions she had learnt by heart in Histories if an outbreak in the kitchen should crown them; and to promote that prospect she had through Susan's eyes more than one glimpse of the way in which Revolutions are prepared. To listen to Susan was to gather that the spark applied to the <b>inflammables</b> and already causing them to crackle would prove to have been the circumstance of one's being called a horrid low thief for refusing to part with one's own. The redeeming point of this tension was, on the fifth day, that it actually appeared to have had to do with a breathless perception in our heroine's breast that scarcely more as the centre of Sir Claude's than as that of Susan's energies she had soon after breakfast been conveyed from London to Folkestone and established at a lovely hotel. These agents, before her wondering eyes, had combined to carry through the adventure and to give it the air of having owed its success to the fact that Mrs. Beale had, as Susan said, but just stepped out. When Sir Claude, watch in hand, had met this fact with the exclamation [...] "Then pack Miss Farange and come off with us!" [...] there had ensued on the stairs a series of gymnastics of a nature to bring Miss Farange's heart into Miss Farange's mouth. She sat with Sir Claude in a four-wheeler while he still held his watch; held it longer than any doctor who had ever felt her pulse; long enough to give her a vision of something like the ecstasy of neglecting such an opportunity to show impatience. The ecstasy had begun in the schoolroom and over the Berceuse, quite in the manner of the same foretaste on the day, a little while back, when Susan had panted up and she herself, after the hint about the duchess, had sailed down; for what harm then had there been in drops and disappointments if she could still have, even only a moment, the sensation of such a name [...] "brought up"? It had remained with her that her father had foretold her she would some day be in the street, but it clearly wouldn't be this day, and she felt justified of the preference betrayed to that parent as soon as her visitor had set Susan in motion and laid his hand, while she waited with him, kindly on her own. This was what the Captain, in Kensington Gardens, had done; her present situation reminded her a little of that one and renewed the dim wonder of the fashion after which, from the first, such pats and pulls had struck her as the steps and signs of other people's business and even a little as the wriggle or the overflow of their difficulties. What had failed her and what had frightened her on the night of the Exhibition lost themselves at present alike in the impression that any [...] "surprise" [...] now about to burst from Sir Claude would be too big to burst all at once. Any awe that might have sprung from his air of leaving out her stepmother was corrected by the force of a general rule, the odd truth that if Mrs. Beale now never came nor went without making her think of him, it was never, to balance that, the main mark of his own renewed reality to appear to be a reference to Mrs. Beale. To be with Sir Claude was to think of Sir Claude, and that law governed Maisie's mind until, through a sudden lurch of the cab, which had at last taken in Susan and ever so many bundles and almost reached Charing Cross, it popped again somehow into her dizzy head the long-lost image of Mrs. Wix.|$|R
