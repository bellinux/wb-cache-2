25|$|All {{four of the}} {{officers}} involved have since quit or have been fired from the LAPD. Officer Theodore Briseno left the LAPD after being acquitted on federal charges. Officer Timothy Wind, who was also acquitted a second time, was fired after the appointment of Willie L. Williams as Chief of Police. Chief Williams' tenure was also short-lived. The Los Angeles Police Commission declined to renew his contract, citing Williams' failure to fulfill his mandate to create meaningful change in the department {{in the wake of}} the Rodney King disaster. Susan Clemmer, an officer who gave crucial testimony for the defense at the initial trial, committed suicide in July 2009 in the lobby of a Los Angeles Sheriff's Station. She rode in the ambulance with King and testified that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> and spat blood on her uniform. She had remained in law enforcement and was a Sheriff's Detective at the time of her death.|$|E
500|$|... "Monkey Gone to Heaven"'s main {{theme is}} environmentalism. The song mainly deals with man's {{destruction}} {{of the ocean and}} [...] "confusion of man's place in the universe". [...] "On one hand, it's [...] this big organic toilet. Things get flushed and repurified or decomposed and it's this big, dark, mysterious place", Black later said, [...] "It's also a very mythological place where there are octopus's gardens, the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis, and mermaids." [...] Francis came up with the song's hook, [...] "this monkey's gone to heaven", long before the song itself was written. The line itself forms a basis for the song, which revolves around man's relationship with the divine and environmentalism. After Francis set the developing lyrics to music, he rushed to lead guitarist Joey Santiago's apartment to play it to him. Santiago later commented on the nascent performance: [...] "It was early in the morning, I was still so tired. [...] 'Hey Joe, I need to come over. I need to show you something.' [...] It was awesome, really good. He had the 'If man is five' part there, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing.</b> [...] It was hilarious".|$|E
500|$|The six {{finally agreed}} that Capper {{had to be}} removed from the house after Michelle Capper told them her {{stepfather}} was going to report her to the police as a missing person. In the early hours of 14 December 1992, Capper was forced into the boot of a stolen white Fiat Panda car and driven 15 miles (25 km) to a narrow lane at Werneth Low near Romiley, on the outskirts of Stockport. In the car were McNeilly, the Powells and Dudson. McNeilly [...] "giggled" [...] as they made the journey. Capper was pushed down an embankment into a patch of brambles and then McNeilly poured petrol over her. Powell stated: [...] "Suzanne was still wobbly and fell over. Bernie [...] said 'Get up.' Bernie pushed her down the hill and poured petrol on her." [...] When McNeilly had difficulty getting the petrol to ignite, Glyn Powell asked Dudson for some paper, who handed him a folded envelope which Powell then attempted to light and use as a taper. After three failed attempts, Dudson said: [...] "In the end he just went up to her with a lighter and lit her. He lit her on the back. She went straight up in flames and was screaming. The flames lit up the whole forest." [...] McNeilly began to sing [...] "Burn baby burn! Burn baby burn!" [...] from the Trammps' song Disco Inferno. [...] Believing Capper to be dead, the four returned to Jean Powell's house, stopping to buy canned drinks on the way. Both Leigh and Pook were at the house when they arrived and Dudson stated: [...] "Cliff [...] asked Glyn , 'Have you done it?' Glyn said 'Yes' and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing.</b> He gave Cliff his lighter back." ...|$|E

500|$|Also at San Diego Comic Con, Derrickson {{noted that}} there were still [...] "a couple pickup shoots" [...] {{to do for the}} film to [...] "clarify the logic". Further content for the film's {{training}} sequence was also shot during these reshoots, as early test audiences [...] "loved [...] and wanted more". Wong indicated that the reshoots had been completed in August. Dan Harmon wrote material for these additional scenes, which Derrickson described as [...] "script analysis and dialogue work", not enough to receive credit in the film. Feige said that in addition to any humor that Harmon could add to the film, he was brought on to [...] "give us his opinions on the sci-fi concepts." [...] Before the film's sets were demolished, [...] director Taika Waititi took advantage by writing and filming a scene featuring Strange meeting Chris Hemsworth's Thor. The scene was for Ragnarok and shot before that film began production. Derrickson and Marvel felt the scene was [...] "kind of perfect" [...] to show Strange joining the wider MCU after his stand alone introduction, and so added it to Doctor Strange as a mid-credits scene. A post-credits scene, directed by Derrickson, teases Mordo's role as an antagonist to Strange in a potential Doctor Strange sequel. Stan Lee's cameo in the film was directed by Gunn on the set of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. This was alongside several other Lee cameos, to limit the amount of travel he had to do for the next four MCU films. Gunn contacted Derrickson during the shoot to ensure that the shot matched up with the respective Doctor Strange scene, and [...] "kept throwing lines at" [...] Lee on the day to give Derrickson and Marvel plenty of options to choose from for the film. Additional options Gunn filmed included: Lee reading a book and asking a gentleman next to him if he knew what the word excelsior meant; Lee laughing really hard and stating <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> for no reason, being [...] "totally crazy"; and Lee laughing hysterically at a Garfield book, noting how the character [...] "HATES Mondays but he LOVES lasagna!". Gunn felt the Garfield option was originally meant to appear in {{the final version of the}} film, but ended up being too long for the scene. By October 10, 2016, Derrickson had completed the film.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughed</b> at by {{all except}} one quiet comrade who gazed thoughtfully eastward, {{back over the}} vast and rolling country. This man was {{thinking}} of home, of wife and little girl, of what pay-day meant for them.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing,</b> {{and the old}} look of boyish love of {{mischief}} illumined his haggard face.|$|E

60|$|When I {{had gone}} a little way, I {{looked back and}} saw that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing,</b> {{throwing}} up his staff as he laughed, and catching it again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll bear it in mind," [...] said Silver with {{an accent}} so curious that I could not, {{for the life}} of me, decide whether <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>laughing</b> at my request or had been favourably {{affected}} by my courage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{replied the}} Reverend Brown apologetically, [...] "not {{to put too}} fine a point on it, I think <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>laughing</b> at you. And indeed, I'm a little {{inclined}} to laugh at myself, now I know about it." ...|$|R
60|$|Thunderer came in third, and {{a couple}} of minutes afterwards, Diana;--and Pat Conner, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughed</b> at as to his place, truly boasted that at any rate <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the only one that had been able to ride round the course without a fall.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked to}} the door, gave her another bow, and left the room, and Jane Gladys could see that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> to himself as if very much amused.|$|E

50|$|Staples said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughed</b> at when <b>he</b> {{suggested}} {{to one of}} the gay rights organizations that they should foster dialogue with those opposed to gay rights, instead of attacking them. Four days later Staples founded ESF, a pacifist LGBT civil rights organization.|$|R
6000|$|Everybody laughed, for {{everybody}} knows that no one asks more questions than Peter Rabbit. Peter laughed with the rest, although he looked a wee bit foolish. But he didn't mean to give up just because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughed</b> at. Oh, my, no! ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughed</b> at by a friend, but logic was his {{as well as}} sentiment; an Italian savant {{maintained}} that the most beautiful combination of English sounds was cellar-door; no association of ideas here to help out! sensuous impression merely! the cellar-door is purely American.|$|R
6000|$|So {{we walked}} away, and I {{was not at}} ease, but was saying to myself, [...] "He told them <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>{{laughing}}</b> at them, {{but it was a}} lie--he was laughing at me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, no, no, papa! She cut {{him to the}} heart, poor boy! thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> at her--told him it had {{all been}} irony. He has no notion whether she will ever forgive him.' ...|$|E
60|$|Matteo {{surpassed the}} others in the outrageousness of his flattery; I thought she must see that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> at her, but she {{accepted}} everything he said quite seriously, and was evidently much pleased.|$|E
5000|$|Miyamoto used [...] "donkey" [...] {{to convey}} [...] "stubborn" [...] in English, the name Donkey Kong was {{intended}} to convey [...] "stubborn ape" [...] to the American audience.

50|$|As his age advanced, however, Haterius {{became less}} useful.

50|$|The Sheriff Callie's Wild West episode Peck Clowns Around had Peck {{dressed up}} as a rodeo clown riding a hobby horse instead of a real horse, like Sparky, that Sheriff Callie used in a rodeo. <b>He</b> thought it <b>was</b> humiliating, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughed</b> at by the entire audience, making Peck very angry.|$|R
60|$|Every instant Granny {{expected}} to hear that dreadful gun, and {{it seemed as if}} her heart would burst with fright as she ran, thinking each jump would be the last one. But the dreadful gun didn't bang, and after a little, when she felt she was safe, she turned to look back over her shoulder. Farmer Brown's boy was standing right where she had last seen him, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> harder than ever. Yes, Sir, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing,</b> and though Old Granny Fox didn't think so at the time, his laugh was good to hear, for it was good-natured and merry and all that an honest laugh should be.|$|E
60|$|Here Rollo's {{father had}} a hearty laugh; and he told Rollo {{that he thought that}} was rather wide shooting. Rollo wanted to know what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> at; and Nathan asked him what he meant by wide shooting.|$|E

25|$|Edward was shy, and {{classmates and}} {{teachers}} remembered him as having strange mannerisms, such as seemingly random laughter, as if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>laughing</b> {{at his own}} personal jokes. To make matters worse, his mother punished him whenever {{he tried to make}} friends. Despite his poor social development, he did fairly well in school, particularly in reading.|$|R
50|$|In {{an ironic}} twist Ziegler, a {{low-level}} municipal administrator, {{is the only}} one to realize that the 'project' was the work of a lunatic; <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>laughed</b> at and himself branded a lunatic.
