The impermeable covered electrode was produced using the commercial E 7018 formula. Preliminary tests with different polymers and formulation changes were realized to meet the satisfactory weld ability. The best covered electrode at the first stage was evaluated at the second stage. Weld metal diffusible hydrogen, microstructure and mechanical properties were evaluated and compared with traditional low <b>hydrogen</b> covered <b>electrodes.</b> In addition, it were made tests to evaluate the slag and fumes generated during the welding. The impermeable covered <b>electrode</b> diffusible <b>hydrogen</b> content was less than 4 mL/ 100 g of weld metal.

In this method molten a luminum was sprayed {{on both sides of}} a spongy plate of nickel as substrate with an acetylene-oxygen flame gun. Then, the spongy nickel electrodes were activated by alloying at a given temperature of from 550 ~ to 750 ~ and leaching the a luminum from the alloy in alkaline solution. This type of catalyst showed good thermal and electrical con-ductivity and also mechanical strength by itself. Its polarization resistance was very low, and the characteristics of the electrodes improved with increase in the temperature of heat-treatment for alloying. The finding that activity depended on the alloying temperature was consistent with observations by scanning electron microscope on the surface textures of cat-a]ysts alloyed at different emperatures.
