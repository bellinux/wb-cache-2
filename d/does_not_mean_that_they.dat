25|$|Peter Singer, a bioethicist {{and author}} of Animal Liberation {{published}} in 1975, suggested that consciousness {{is not necessarily the}} key issue: just because animals have smaller brains, or are ‘less conscious’ than humans, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not capable of feeling pain. He goes on further to argue that we do not assume newborn infants, people suffering from neurodegenerative brain diseases or people with learning disabilities experience less pain than we would.|$|E

Rather, just like Calvinists belief in predeterminism in Europe, the Ajivikas were optimists. The Ajivikas simply {{did not believe in}} the moral force of action, or in merits or demerits, or in after-life {{affected}} because of what one does or does not do. Actions had immediate effects in one's current life but without any moral traces, and both the action and the effect was predetermined, according to the Ajivikas.|$|E
25|$|The Toegye School, {{founded by}} Yi Hwang, {{believed}} that Li (rationality) was absolute, while Qi (material) was relative (this, however, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{believed that the}} Li was in any way superior to the Qi). They also believed that the Li and the Qi were completely different, and that the human ethics were Li (rational), while the human emotions were Qi (material). The latter idea was attacked by Yi I, who believed that ethics were just a positive side of the emotions. The Toegye School were {{the majority of the}} Southerners, and remained the contender of the Giho School to the eighteenth century.|$|E
25|$|This <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not {{purebred}} Chihuahuas; {{they just}} {{do not meet the}} requirements to enter a conformation show. Oversized Chihuahuas are seen in some of the best, and worst, bloodlines. Chihuahuas do not breed true for size, and puppies from the same litter can mature drastically different sizes from one another. As well, larger breeding females are less likely to experience dystocia. Typically, the breed standard for both the long and short coat Chihuahua will be identical except for the description of the coat. Chihuahuas have large, round eyes and large, erect ears, set in a high, dramatically rounded skull.|$|E

25|$|Bank of England {{notes are}} the only {{banknotes}} that are legal tender in England and Wales. Scottish and Northern Irish banknotes are not legal tender anywhere, and Jersey, Guernsey and Manx banknotes are only legal tender in their respective jurisdictions. Although these banknotes are not legal tender in the UK, this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are illegal under English law, and creditors and traders may accept them if they so choose. Traders may, on the other hand, choose not to accept banknotes as payment, as contract law across the United Kingdom allows parties {{not to engage in}} a transaction at the point of payment if they choose not to.|$|E
25|$|The 9th, 11th and 13th chords {{are known}} as {{extended}} tertian chords. As the scale repeats for every seven notes in the scale, these notes are enharmonically equivalent to the 2nd, 4th, and 6th– except they are more than an octave above the root. However, this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> must be played in the higher octave. Although changing the octave of certain notes in a chord (within reason) does {{change the way the}} chord sounds, it does not change the essential characteristics or tendency of it. Accordingly, using 9th, 11th and 13th in chord notation implies that the chord is an extended tertian chord rather than an added chord (see Added Chords below).|$|E
500|$|Several {{groups and}} {{persons in the}} Netherlands have called for legal action against Wilders, while others defended his right to free speech. On 15 August 2007, a {{representative}} of the Prosecutors' Office in Amsterdam declared that dozens of reports against Wilders had been filed, and that they were all being considered. Attempts to prosecute Wilders under Dutch anti-hate speech laws in June 2008 failed, with the public prosecutor's office stating that Wilders' comments contributed to the debate on Islam in Dutch society and also had been made outside parliament. The office released a statement reading: [...] "That comments are hurtful and offensive for a large number of Muslims <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are punishable. Freedom of expression fulfils an essential role in public debate in a democratic society. That means that offensive comments can be made in a political debate." ...|$|E

500|$|Many of the {{original}} characters graduated from McKinley High {{at the end of}} the third season. Murphy said, [...] "We didn't want to have a show where they were in high school for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience." [...] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—would likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are leaving, [...] "A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show. I think Amber was talking about that bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the choir room with that exact group of people.' At least that's what she told me ... When I read that [...] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them." [...] He then continued: [...] "They're all coming back. Anyone who is a regular is coming back. Everyone said yes." ...|$|E
500|$|The Inaccessible rail is {{endemic to}} the {{uninhabited}} Inaccessible Island in the Tristan da Cunha {{group in the}} mid-Atlantic Ocean. The island is [...] in area and has a temperate wet oceanic climate with high rainfall, limited sunshine and persistent westerly winds. The rail is found in almost all habitats {{on the island and}} at all altitudes, from sea-level to [...] It reaches its highest densities in fields of tussock grass (Spartina arundinacea), with 10 birds per hectare, and in tussock grass mixed with ferns (Blechnum penna-marina) and sedges, with 15 birds per hectare. This habitat is found close to the shore and surrounds most of the island on the steep cliffs. The Inaccessible Island rail can also be found in upland fern-bush heath, dominated by wind-stunted tree-ferns (Blechnum palmiforme) and in the island forest in the central plateau which is dominated by Island Cape myrtle (Phylica arborea)—which can reach [...] where sheltered—and Blechnum palmiforme. In both these habitats the population is estimated to be two birds per hectare. It will also forage among boulders on the beaches, but has not been found in the short dry grasses on the cinder cones (the scientists making the observations cautioned that this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> never use the habitat). It frequently uses natural cavities among boulders or tunnels through grasses created by frequent use to move around while concealed.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Murphy {{announced}} that the cast of Glee would be replaced {{at the end of}} the third season to coincide with their graduation. He said, [...] "Every year we're going to populate a new group. There's nothing more depressing than a high schooler with a bald spot." [...] He also revealed that some of the original cast would leave as early as 2012: [...] "I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives." [...] Murphy stated in July 2011 that Colfer would be one of the actors leaving {{at the end of the}} third season, and Colfer commented on the report, saying, [...] "We had kind of known since the beginning, since we started the show, that these characters were going to grow up and they were going to graduate eventually. I don't think I thought it was going to happen so soon, necessarily, but I think we knew something like this was coming." [...] However, Falchuk later said that while Colfer, along with Lea Michele and Cory Monteith, would graduate at the end of the third season, their graduation <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will leave the show.

2500|$|But {{if people}} with firmly held {{negative}} self-views seek self-verification, this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are masochistic or {{have no desire}} to be loved. In fact, even people with very low self-esteem want to be loved. What sets people with negative self-views apart is their ambivalence about the evaluations they receive. Just as positive evaluations foster joy and warmth initially, these feelings are later chilled by incredulity. And although negative evaluations may foster sadness that the [...] "truth" [...] could not be kinder, it will at least reassure them that they know themselves. Happily, people with negative self-views are {{the exception rather than the}} rule. That is, on the balance, most people tend to view themselves positively. Although this imbalance is adaptive for society at large, it poses a challenge to researchers interested in studying self-verification. That is, for theorists interested in determining if behavior is driven by self-verification or positivity strivings, participants with positive self-views will reveal nothing because both motives compel them to seek positive evaluations. If researchers want to learn if people prefer verification or positivity in a giving setting, they must study people with negative self-views.|$|E
