5|$|Frank Richards succeeded Watson as club {{secretary}} in 1911, {{and when the}} First World War broke out {{he took over the}} managerial reins as well. Under Richards Birmingham won the Second Division title in 1921 and signed players such as Joe Bradford, Johnny Crosbie and Dan Tremelling who did much to keep the club in the top flight through the 1920s. He also forgot to enter them in the 1922 FA Cup. Billy Beer and Bill Harvey <b>kept</b> <b>them</b> in the First Division, albeit in {{the lower half of the}} table, before former Arsenal manager Leslie Knighton took charge in 1928. He led them to their first FA Cup final in 1931 and a top-half league finish the following year, but left when Chelsea made him an offer Birmingham were unable to match. Former Birmingham defender George Liddell <b>kept</b> <b>them</b> in the top tier until they were relegated in the last season completed before the Second World War, resigning in September 1939 when league football was suspended. His tenure of just over six years made him the club's longest-serving team manager.|$|E

He also displayed great courage that day when he helped to carry eight British and Indian officers to safety while exposed to heavy fire.|$|E

5|$|The Morris Academy is {{entitled}} {{to be called a}} pioneer institution because of its 'open door' policy in coeducation.

A number of factors have been proposed, including competition and predation by introduced species, disease, deforestation and persecution by humans, who hunted it for food and as an alleged crop pest.|$|E

5|$|The prior era saw great {{military}} {{successes and}} great economic failures. The patriotism of the plebeians had <b>kept</b> <b>them</b> from seeking any new reforms.

Whippets are, like other sighthounds, intolerant of barbiturate anaesthetics. This is in part due to their low concentration of body fat and their liver's inability to metabolise the anaesthetics.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} toss, Northamptonshire captain Jim Watts opted to bowl first. Somerset scored 269 runs off their full {{allocation}} of 60 overs, during which West Indian batsman Viv Richards top-scored for the county, totalling 117 runs. In their response, Northamptonshire lost early wickets, but a partnership of 113 between Geoff Cook and Allan Lamb <b>kept</b> <b>them</b> in the game. Six wickets from Joel Garner helped Somerset bowl their opponents out for 224 with 3.3 overs remaining, earning the county the first trophy in their 104-year history.|$|E

They finished on the same number of points as Everton, whom they faced in the first competitive match at the newly built Reebok Stadium. The game finished 0–0, but a goal by Gerry Taggart for the Whites was mistakenly not given; the point swing in Bolton's favour would have <b>kept</b> <b>them</b> up. The following season they reached the 1999 Division One play-off Final but lost 2–0 to Watford.|$|E

Braun's dogs and Blondi's puppies were shot on 30 April by Hitler's dog handler, Fritz Tornow.|$|E
5|$|England and France {{were in the}} {{concluding}} stages of the Hundred Years War. The French {{did not wish to}} lose their advantage in the fight by sending knights and the English were in no position to do so. Spain was {{in the final stages of}} the Reconquista. The Holy Roman Empire, never centralized enough behind the Hohenstaufen to unite the principalities, had exhausted what could be spared at Varna. Further fighting among the German princes and the Hussite wars seriously reduced the willingness of most to perform a crusade. Poland and Hungary were key participants at Varna and the defeat there along with the Polish–Teutonic Wars <b>kept</b> <b>them</b> busy and unwilling for further commitments.|$|E

5|$|In July 1942 the U-boats {{became aware}} of Coastal Command {{aircraft}} using another innovation – sonobuoys, which were {{thought of as the}} air equivalent of the Navy's ASDIC. A U-boat reported them on 29 July being dropped in the north transit area, and they were thought by the enemy to be devices for preventing U-boats from travelling on the surface. They were, in fact, for detecting submerged U-boats, and were used by No. 210 Squadron RAF, operating Sunderlands. In operational records they were coded High Tea. Most crews were unaware of their existence. The devices stayed in use until 1998, when some wartime crews saw them for the first time. Until then the RAF had <b>kept</b> <b>them</b> secret.|$|E

5|$|Just before half time, a try by Newport's Jack Wetter was {{disallowed}} for {{a forward}} pass. The ball was then worked back to Fred Birt, standing within range {{in front of}} the posts, and he kicked a drop-goal, putting the home side 4–0 ahead at the break. In the second half, the Springboks repeatedly attacked but the Newport defence <b>kept</b> <b>them</b> from crossing the line, although a break from Dick Luyt, the South African centre, left Douglas Morkel to score under the posts. Luyt failed to convert and Newport remained a point ahead. Newport scored again through a cross-kick from Wetter, which Birt jumped on over the line for a try, which he then converted.|$|E
