5|$|The {{proportion}} of cell volume that is cytosol varies: for example while this compartment forms {{the bulk of}} cell structure in bacteria, in plant cells the main compartment is the large central vacuole. The cytosol consists mostly of water, dissolved ions, small molecules, and large water-soluble molecules (such as proteins). The majority of these non-protein molecules have a molecular mass of less than 300Da. This mixture of small molecules is extraordinarily complex, as the variety of molecules {{that are involved in}} metabolism (the metabolites) <b>is</b> <b>immense.</b> For example, up to 200,000 different small molecules might be made in plants, although not all these will be present in the same species, or in a single cell. Estimates of the number of metabolites in single cells such as E. coli and baker's yeast predict that under 1,000 are made.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Moscow Helsinki Group {{chairwoman}} Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests <b>is</b> <b>immense.</b> Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E

By nature Munch was very introvert, and not one who would easily connect with other people. He insisted on always using the most formal forms of address, and even with friends he didn't use first-names. This is also the reason why he became known only as P. Munch.

25|$|The free {{practice}} of eugenics could lead {{not only to}} the development of stronger individuals, but also of strains endowed with more endurance, intelligence, and courage. These strains should constitute an aristocracy, from which great men would probably appear. Modern society must promote, by all possible means, the formation of better human stock. No financial or moral rewards should be too great for those who, through the wisdom of their marriage, would engender geniuses. The complexity of our civilization <b>is</b> <b>immense.</b> No one can master all its mechanisms. However, these mechanisms have to be mastered. There is need today of men of larger mental and moral size, capable of accomplishing such a task. The establishment of a hereditary biological aristocracy through voluntary eugenics would be an important step toward the solution of our present problems.|$|E

25|$|This {{bibliography}} of George Washington {{is a comprehensive}} list of written and published works about George Washington, first President of the United States, his life in general or in part and includes primary sources containing Washington's works, letters, records, diaries, etc. The literature on Washington <b>is</b> <b>immense,</b> his biographers and editors having lived in four separate centuries. Many of the publications listed here lend themselves to Washington in a biographical capacity, while many cover specific events and other topics where Washington is the central or an important figure. Publications covering subjects such as 'The Winter at Valley Forge', 'The Battle of Brooklyn' and Washington's farewell address are well placed {{and can be found}} in this bibliography. Washington was diligent about keeping records, maintained many dairies throughout his adult life, and corresponded with many prominent figures, family members and friends. At this late date nearly all of Washington's writings have been studied, transcribed, organized, edited and published by a good number of historians over the years, providing the basis by which the many biographical accounts of Washington's life have been written.|$|E

500|$|The {{influence}} of the Canon of Polykleitos <b>is</b> <b>immense</b> in Classical Greek, Roman, and Renaissance sculpture, many sculptors following Polykleitos's prescription. While none of Polykleitos's original works survive, Roman copies demonstrate his ideal of physical perfection and mathematical precision. Some scholars argue that Pythagorean thought influenced the Canon of Polykleitos. The Canon applies the basic mathematical concepts of Greek geometry, such as the ratio, proportion, and symmetria (Greek for [...] "harmonious proportions") and turns it into a system capable of describing the human form {{through a series of}} continuous geometric progressions.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{remains of}} Homo sapiens {{date back to}} approximately 195 thousand years ago in eastern Africa. In the archaeological record of both eastern Africa and southern Africa, there <b>is</b> <b>immense</b> variability associated with Homo sapiens sites, and it is during this time that we see evidence {{of the origins of}} modern human behavior. According to McBrearty and Brooks, there are four features that are characteristic of modern human behavior: abstract thinking, the ability to plan and strategize, [...] "behavioral, economic and technological innovativeness," [...] and symbolic behavior. Many of these aspects of modern human behavior can be broken down into more specific categories, including art, personal adornment, technological advancement, yet these four overarching categories allow for a thorough, albeit significantly overlapping, discussion of behavioral modernity.|$|E

[...] "His work and Foster's created the visual standard by which all such comic strips would henceforth be measured." [...] Biographer Tom Roberts also believes Raymond's work on Rip Kirby [...] "inspired all the soap opera style strips of the fifties and sixties". Roberts argues that strips such as Apartment 3-G [...] "can trace their origins to the success of Raymond's strip". Although his work was rarely seen outside of the newspaper [...] "funny pages", as Raymond preferred to focus his energies on strip work, he also produced a number of [...] "illustrations for Blue Book, Look, Collier's and Cosmopolitan". as well as Esquire.|$|E
