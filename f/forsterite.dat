Thermally and photometrically corrected reflectance spectra display low geometric albedo, different red VIS and IR spectral slopes, and a complex broad absorption band centered at 3. 2 μm. The low albedo {{and the structure}} of the ubiquitous 3. 2 μm band suggest that the cometary surface is homogeneously enriched in refractory organic materials and darkening phases (Capaccioni et al., 2015). Detailed studies of laboratory analogue materials are necessary to disentangle different interfering factors that influence the appearance of reflectance spectra. Thus, such investigations are indispensable for reliable compositional analysis of remote sensing data. Here we present 0. 25 - 5 μm laboratory reflectance spectra of well-characterized terrestrial hydrocarbon materials (solid oil bitumens, coals) and discuss their relevance as spectral analogues for 67 P/CG refractory organics. In addition, the possible contribution of inorganic matter to spectral characteristics of 67 P/CG should be understood based on laboratory reflectance measurements. Although a wide range of silicate compositions was found in cometary dust and anhydrous IDPs of presumably cometary origin, Mg-rich crystalline mafic minerals are dominant silicate components. A large fraction of silicate grains are Fe-free pyroxenes and olivines (<b>forsterites)</b> that are not found in terrestrial rocks but can be synthesized in order to provide a basis for laboratory studies and comparison with VIRTIS data. We report the results of the synthesis, analyses, and/or spectral reflectance measurements of Fe-free low-Ca pyroxenes (ortho- and clinoenstatites), <b>forsterites,</b> and a high-Ca pyroxene (diopside). Finally, fine-grained opaque refractory phases (e. g. iron sulfides, Fe-Ni alloys) are likely responsible for the low IR reflectance and low contrast of the 3. 2 μm absorption band. Therefore, we present and discuss 0. 25 – 5 μm reflectance spectra of pure Fe-sulfides (troilites, pyrrhotites) and their intimate mixtures with organic and inorganic analogue materials. Based on the reported laboratory data, we discuss the ability of iron sulfides to suppress absorption bands of other cometary refractory components and to affect the spectral slopes and reflectance values of the 67 P/CG surface at different wavelengths from the near-UV to the IR. Summarizing these results, we discuss some prospects for future spectral studies...|$|R

30|$|Among {{recent reports}} on the {{hydrogen}} incorporation mechanisms in olivine, the presence of clinohumite-type OH defects has been proposed {{as one of the}} critical natural incorporation mechanisms (Miller et al. 1987; Berry et al. 2005; Mosenfelder et al. 2006 b; Berry et al. 2007; Walker et al. 2007). Our IR characterization should not be applied to the investigation of olivine point defect structures because the reported IR spectra in olivine are suggestive of dissimilarities between TiChu structures and TiChu-like defects. For instance, <b>forsterites</b> synthesized under an MgO and TiO 2 buffer (Berry et al. 2005) show stronger IR absorption peaks at 3, 572 and 3, 525 than around 3, 415 to 3, 390, whereas our results consistently showed stronger peaks around the 3, 415 to 3, 390 region than either of the peaks at 3, 572 or 3, 525. In Berry et al. (2005), the 3, 572 and 3, 525 peaks are attributed to TiChu-like OH-incorporating defects. We note that the TiChu OH stretching peaks are at 3, 565 and 3, 528, offsets of - 7 and + 3  cm- 1 from that of the OH defect in olivine. Looking at the spectra qualitatively (Figure  1 in Berry et al. 2005), the defect peaks are similar to the clinohumite peaks, but these offsets are significantly beyond the uncertainty of the instrument. These disparities point {{to the fact that the}} casually termed ‘titanian clinohumite-like defect’ is structurally dissimilar to TiChu minerals apart from the fact that both have Ti in the sixfold coordinate site. Mosenfelder et al. (2006 b) presents a similar conclusion based on the inconsistency of peak intensities found in experimental and natural olivine crystals with TiChu-like defects.|$|R

Thermally corrected reflectance spectra display a low albedo of 0. 06 at 0. 65 µm, different red VIS and IR spectral slopes, {{and a broad}} 3. 2 µm band. This absorption feature is due to refractory surface constituents attributed to organic components, but other refractory constituents influence albedo and spectral slopes. Possible contributions of inorganic components to spectral characteristics and spectral variations across the surface should be understood based on laboratory studies and spectral modeling. Although {{a wide range of}} silicate compositions was found in "cometary" anhydrous IDPs and cometary dust, Mg-rich crystalline mafic minerals are dominant silicate components. A large fraction of silicate grains are Fe-free enstatites and <b>forsterites</b> that are not found in terrestrial rocks but can be synthesized in order to provide a basis for laboratory studies and comparison with VIRTIS data. We report the results of the synthesis, analyses, and spectral reflectance measurements of Fe-free low-Ca pyroxenes (ortho- and clinoenstatites). These minerals are generally very bright and almost spectrally featureless. However, even trace amounts of Fe-ions produce a significant decrease in the near-UV reflectance and hence can contribute to slope variations. Iron sulfides (troilite, pyrrhotite) are among the most plausible phases responsible for the low reflectance of 67 P's surface from the VIS to the NIR. The darkening efficiency of these opaque phases is strongly particle-size dependent. Here we present a series of reflectance spectra of fine-grained synthetic enstatite powders mixed in various proportions with iron sulfide powders.

40|$|Analysis of 0. 25 - 5 μm {{reflectance}} spectra {{acquired by}} the Visible and InfraRed Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) onboard Rosetta orbiter revealed that the surface of comet 67 P/CG is dark from the near-UV to the IR and is enriched in refractory phases such as organic and opaque components. The broadness {{and complexity of the}} ubiquitous absorption feature around 3. 2 μm suggest a variety of cometary organic constituents. For example, complex hydrocarbons can contribute to the feature between 3. 2 and 3. 5 μm and to the low reflectance of the surface in the visible. Relevance of natural macromolecular solids, such as solid oil bitumens (asphaltites, kerites, anthraxolites) and coals as spectral analogs for the hydrocarbon part of cometary refractory organics were discussed in detail in the literature. Fine-grained opaque refractory phases (e. g. iron sulfides, Fe-Ni alloys) are likely responsible for the low IR reflectance and low contrast of the 3. 2 μm absorption band. Other non-icy constituents that may contribute to spectral reflectance properties of the 67 P surface include amorphous and crystalline silicates. Here we report and discuss the 0. 3 - 5 μm reflectance spectra of relevant Fe-sulfides (meteoritic troilite and several terrestrial pyrrhotites) ground and sieved to various particle sizes. We report the results of the synthesis, analyses, and/or spectral reflectance measurements of Fe-free low-Ca pyroxenes (ortho- and clinoenstatites), <b>forsterites,</b> and a high-Ca pyroxene (diopside). We present reflectance spectra of intimate mixtures of powdered Fe-sulfides with kerite (as an example of a relevant macromolecular organic solid) and synthetic orthoenstatite. We investigate and discuss the ability of Fe-sulfides to suppress absorption bands of other cometary refractory components and to affect the spectral slopes and reflectance values of the 67 P/CG surface at different wavelengths from the near-UV to the IR. Finally, we discuss the evolution of organic absorption bands as a function of sulfide content in the mixtures and the possibility for detection of individual C-H stretching bands in the VIRTIS spectra of 67 P/CG. We show that spectral reflectance of the ubiquitous dark material on the surface of 67 P is mostly controlled by fine-grained opaques and organic refractories, while silicate components play a less significant role and are unlikely to contribute significantly to the VIRTIS spectra and to the observed spectral variations across the 67 P surface. We demonstrate that fine-grained Fe-sulfides (troilite and pyrrhotite) are effective darkening agents from the near UV to IR that can explain the very low IR reflectance of the 67 P nucleus. The shape of the VIRTIS spectra in the visible range is consistent with the presence of polyaromatic-rich organics together with Fe-sulfides. Fe-sulfides intimately mixed with other components significantly influence shapes and relative contrasts of absorption bands of other phases. If real, the fine structure in the VIRTIS spectra between 3. 2 and 3. 5 μm could be indicative of individual C-H absorption bands in aromatic structures, methyl and methylene groups. Further work is needed to clarify which species contribute to the broad complex 3. 2 -μm band in the VIRTIS spectra and to the spectral shape between 1. 5 and 2. 5 μm...|$|R
