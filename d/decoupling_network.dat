Parallel coupled lines (PCLs) and transmission lines (TLs) with different electrical lengths {{are considered to}} control the magnitude and phase of this <b>decoupling</b> <b>network,</b> respectively. The coupling coefficient of the PCLs is adjusted with various line widths and coupled gaps so that {{the magnitude of this}} network will be equal to that of the coupled antennas.

Thus, the mutual coupling between the coupled antennas can be canceled. A prototype is fabricated on a RO 4003 print circuit board (PCB) for demonstration.

40|$|Abstract—In {{radio-frequency}} {{systems that}} drive coupled dis-sipative loads, the matching network between the amplifiers and their loads needs {{to account for}} the coupling. With N amplifiers driving N loads, a favorite choice is a “decoupling ” network, which is a lossless reciprocal network that has N input ports connected to the sources and N output ports connected to the loads. The <b>decoupling</b> <b>network</b> transforms the coupled impedance of the loads into the uncoupled characteristic impedance of the sources. Any incident signal at the input ports of the network is transferred, without reflection, to the loads. Decoupling net-works can be realized by generalized Π-networks of lumped and distributed impedances, depending on the design frequency. Although the impedance requirements of the network are unique, its realization is not, and networks that involve many impedances can be complex to lay out on circuit boards.

We conjecture that both simulated annealing and SGD converge to the band of low critical points, and that all critical points found there are local minima of high quality measured by the test error. This emphasizes a major difference between large- and small-size networks where for the latter poor quality local minima have non-zero probability of being recovered.

The random key predistribution ðRKPÞ protocol has been well accepted in achieving secure communications in WSNs. A host of key management protocols have been proposed based on the RKP protocol.
