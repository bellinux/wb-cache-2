30|$|A {{source model}} of long-period {{volcanic}} earthquakes is presented. We {{consider that a}} fluid-filled spherical cavity surrounded by an infinite elastic medium is excited into resonance like the Earth’s free oscillations. The eigenequation of this system is derived <b>in</b> <b>a</b> general manner, making use of the spherical harmonic and spherical Bessel expansions. The solution is given as a complex number; its real part is the eigenfrequency and the imaginary part represents the attenuation coefficient of the oscillation. The eigenmodes are classified into five groups: (1) the compressional <b>modes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fluid sphere, (2) the compressional <b>modes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> solid medium, (3) the shear <b>modes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> solid medium, (4) the Stoneley modes, and (5) the torsional modes. We apply them to the long-period volcanic earthquake observed at Asama volcano, Japan. Estimating the characteristic frequencies and attenuation coefficients of the observed vibrations and assuming that the primary component (f = 1.73 Hz) corresponds to the fundamental translation mode of a fluid sphere {{as one of the}} compressional <b>modes</b> <b>in</b> fluid, we conclude that the resonator which is a spherical cavity of diameter 220 m filled with steam of temperature 500 °C and pressure 170 atm is favorable.|$|R
