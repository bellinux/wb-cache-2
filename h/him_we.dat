5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring <b>him,</b> <b>we</b> honor the best in ourselves.|$|E

25|$|We {{gave him}} Isaac and Jacob: all (three) guided: and before <b>him,</b> <b>We</b> guided Noah, and among his progeny, David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron: thus do We reward {{those who do}} good: And Zakariya and John, and Jesus and Elias: all {{in the ranks of}} the righteous: And Isma'il and Elisha, and Jonas, and Lot: and to all We gave favour above the nations.|$|E

25|$|The {{identification}} of the primitive form Eculisna then alternating the old forms -isna and -isma led Ernest Nègre to prefer the first with -isna. The first element would be Ecul-. According to <b>him,</b> <b>we</b> can neither affirm the Celticity of these two elements nor their meaning. The alteration in *Angulisma {{was caused by the}} attraction of the Germanic personal name Angelisma whose existence was confirmed by Marie-Thérèse Morlet.|$|E
25|$|Ten days later, on 6 November, Kiyoaki has {{dinner with}} his parents; they discuss his otachimachi (divination ritual), {{that had been}} held on 17 August 1909, and mention that Satoko has just {{rejected}} an offer of marriage. This explains her mysterious question. Kiyoaki and his father play billiards, then go for a stroll that reminds Kiyoaki of his father's former womanising. The marquis tries {{to persuade him to}} go with him to a brothel and he walks away in disgust. Later he cannot sleep, resolving to take revenge on Satoko for deliberately perplexing <b>him.</b> <b>We</b> are shown Kiyoaki's bedroom: a screen bearing poems of Han Shan, and a carved jade parrot. We can also see that Kiyoaki has three moles in a row {{on the left side of}} his torso, a fact that becomes important in later books.|$|E
25|$|Often we {{encompass}} {{the record of}} an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor {{has said that the}} defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate our defense we wish to remember this first point, we shall in our first background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. If we do not know <b>him,</b> <b>we</b> shall yet take some one to be our invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at once. And we shall place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left hand tablets, and on the fourth finger a ram's testicles (Latin testiculi suggests testes or witnesses). In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses.|$|E

6000|$|... "I see the Jew is dead; {{fell on his}} own knife. It is just as {{well for}} <b>him,</b> for <b>we</b> should have tied him to a tree, and made a bonfire of <b>him,</b> if <b>we</b> had caught him." ...|$|R
500|$|Several seconds later, West gave an on-the-spot {{account of}} the {{struggle}} with Sirhan in the hotel kitchen pantry, shouting at Rafer Johnson to [...] "Get the gun, Rafer, get the gun!" [...] and telling others to [...] "get a hold of [...] thumb and break it, if you have to! Get his thumb! [...] Hold him, hold <b>him!</b> <b>We</b> don't want another Oswald!" ...|$|E
500|$|Brown {{notes that}} Reynolds was not {{comfortable}} with the nickname because {{of the importance of}} the 'chief' title. He also explained that his teammates called him Chief. [...] "When we talked with <b>him,</b> <b>we</b> called him Allie... But when he wasn't in the room, he was referred to as the Chief, because we felt he was the one at the top, the real leader." ...|$|E
500|$|Ante Marković has {{described}} {{that after the}} Presidency meeting failed to achieve the results the Army wanted that Kadijević met with him with the proposed coup d'etat against the secessionist republics. During the meeting Marković responded to Kadijević {{by saying that the}} plan failed to arrest Milošević. Kadijević replied [...] "He is only one fighting for Yugoslavia. Without <b>him,</b> <b>we</b> could not be proposing this." [...] Marković rejected the plan and afterwards communication between Kadijević and Marković broke down.|$|E
6000|$|... "Like a fa—like a uncle, mum," [...] {{said the}} thoughtless Mr. Legge. [...] "Gave ’im a passage {{on the ship}} and fairly spoilt <b>’im.</b> <b>We</b> was all {{surprised}} at the fuss ’e made of ’im; wasn’t we, Harry?" ...|$|R

5000|$|And {{let them}} {{remember}} that prayer should accompany {{the reading of}} Sacred Scripture, so that God and man may talk together; for [...] "we speak to <b>Him</b> when <b>we</b> pray; <b>we</b> hear <b>Him</b> when <b>we</b> read the divine saying.|$|R
500|$|I {{talked to}} Yoko {{the day after}} he was killed, and the first thing she said was, [...] "John was really fond of you." [...] The last {{telephone}} conversation I had with <b>him</b> <b>we</b> were still the best of mates. He was always a very warm guy, John. His bluff was all on the surface. He used to take his glasses down, those granny glasses, and say, [...] "it's only me." [...] They were like a wall you know? A shield. Those are the moments I treasure.|$|E
500|$|The JFK tower {{controller}} {{asked the}} flight to climb to [...] and make a left turn. At 21:24:06, the captain asked the first officer to [...] "tell them we are in [...] emergency." [...] The first officer told the JFK tower controller that [...] "we'll try once again we're running out of fuel," [...] to which the controller replied, [...] "okay." [...] A few seconds later, the captain again told the first officer to [...] "advise <b>him</b> <b>we</b> are [...] emergency" [...] {{and asked if he}} did so. The first officer replied, [...] "Yes sir, I already advised him." [...] The JFK controller directed {{the flight to}} contact the NY TRACON approach controller once more at 21:24:39. The TRACON controller asked the flight to climb once more to [...] The captain asked the first officer again to [...] "advise <b>him</b> <b>we</b> don't have fuel." [...] The first officer replied, [...] "Climb and maintain three thousand and ah we're running out of fuel sir." [...] The captain once again asked whether the first officer had advised the controller of the fuel emergency, and the first officer replied, [...] "Yes sir. I already advise him hundred and eighty on the heading we are going to maintain three thousand feet and he's going to get us back." ...|$|E
500|$|Following his {{departure}} from the Grand Fleet, the king had a message sent to the officers and men of the ships he had just left. It began with a warm reference to the American squadron: [...] "I am happy to have found myself once more with the Grand Fleet, and this pleasure has been increased by the opportunity I have had of seeing the splendid ships of the United States in line with our own, and of meeting Admiral Rodman together with the officers and men under <b>him.</b> <b>We</b> value their comradeship and {{are proud of their}} achievements." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A great deal,' replied Kate; 'but not now. I {{would rather}} speak to <b>him</b> when <b>we</b> are alone;--it will save his time if I thank {{him and say}} what I wish to say to <b>him,</b> as <b>we</b> walk along.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The Fathers of the Church {{recommended}} this practice: St. Jerome {{says that}} when we pray we speak to God; but when we read, God speaks to us. St. Ambrose of Milan says the same: [...] "We address <b>him</b> when <b>we</b> pray; <b>we</b> hear <b>him</b> when <b>we</b> read." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{if we do}} our duty," [...] said Adela. And then as {{he looked}} as if he hadn't an idea of what that could be: [...] "You must speak to him--tell <b>him</b> how <b>we</b> feel; that we shall never forgive <b>him,</b> that <b>we</b> can't endure it." ...|$|R
500|$|SEAL Team 10's sniper. Wahlberg {{recommended}} Foster to Berg, as {{they had}} previously collaborated on Contraband (2012). Prior to filming, Foster met with the fallen serviceman's family and friends to understand the person he would be portraying. [...] "It was such a rich opportunity {{to listen to the}} Axelsons talk about their son. Their generosity and inclusiveness with me was so touching and open. They love to talk about their boy because they love him; so we, in turn, love <b>him.</b> <b>We</b> can’t bring him back, but what we can do is aim, every day, to do the best that we can to honor him." ...|$|E
500|$|... "My {{married name}} is Mrs. Lisa Marie Presley-Jackson. My {{marriage}} to Michael Jackson {{took place in}} a private ceremony outside the United States (11) weeks ago. It was not formally announced until now for several reasons; foremost being that we are both very private people living in the glare of the public media. We both wanted a private marriage ceremony without the distraction of a media circus. I am very much in love with Michael, I dedicate my life to being his wife. I understand and support <b>him.</b> <b>We</b> both look forward to raising a family and living happy, healthy lives together. We hope friends and fans will understand and respect our privacy." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics have}} been more skeptical {{of the concept of}} {{identifying}} the dreamer of the book's narrative. Clive Hart argues that [...] "hatever our conclusions about the identity of the dreamer, and no matter how many varied caricatures of <b>him</b> <b>we</b> may find projected into the dream, it is clear that he must always be considered as essentially external to the book, and should be left there. Speculation about the 'real person' behind the guises of the dream-surrogates or about the function of the dream in relation to the unresolved stresses of this hypothetical mind is fruitless, for the tensions and psychological problems in Finnegans Wake concern the dream-figures living within the book itself." ...|$|E
60|$|And yet we knew 'twas in <b>'im,</b> <b>we</b> knew as 'e could fly; But what we couldn't git at was 'ow to make 'im try. We'd almost {{turned the}} job up, {{until at last}} one day We got the last yard out of 'im in a most amazin' way.|$|R
60|$|But at {{last that}} which I had feared befell us. We were {{not more than}} a couple of hundred paces behind <b>him</b> when <b>we</b> lost all trace of him. He had {{vanished}} behind some rolling ground, and we could see nothing of <b>him</b> when <b>we</b> reached the summit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay--ay--my good fellow, I {{knew your}} father, {{and was in}} the third ship from him, in the action in which he fell," [...] {{returned}} the vice-admiral, kindly. [...] "Bluewater was just ahead of <b>him,</b> and <b>we</b> all loved <b>him,</b> as <b>we</b> did an elder brother. You were not promoted, then." ...|$|R
500|$|Rowland told MTV that [...] "working with David is amazing. We {{have a great}} relationship, it's so effortless. He's such {{a talented}} individual. But most {{importantly}} he's such a down to earth, nice guy and I really enjoy working with <b>him.</b> <b>We</b> have good musical chemistry together." [...] Guetta told Billboard that [...] "the track with Kelly has made him experiment with a more American urban influence. Musically, it's pure pop {{with a lot of}} detail." [...] Additionally British singer Cheryl Cole (of Girls Aloud) credited [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] for inspiring her taste and preference in dance music, which in turn influenced her second solo single [...] "3 Words" [...] (featuring will.i.am).|$|E
500|$|Following Roy Hodgson's {{appointment}} as Liverpool manager, Hodgson stated that Torres {{would not be}} sold by the club, saying, [...] "He is not for sale and we don't welcome any offers for <b>him.</b> <b>We</b> want to keep him." [...] Hodgson dismissed reports Torres was set to leave Liverpool by saying, [...] "He has {{told us that he}} is looking forward to Monday, to getting back to work and looking forward to playing for Liverpool next season. That is what I know so other reports, I would suggest, are erroneous." [...] Torres stated his commitment to Liverpool on 3 August: [...] "My commitment and loyalty to the club and to the fans is {{the same as it was}} on my first day when I signed." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{contributor}} to Bentley's Miscellany wrote in 1846: [...] "To those who never saw him, description is fruitless; {{to those who}} have, no praise comes up to their appreciation of <b>him.</b> <b>We</b> therefore shake our heads and say 'Ah! You should have seen Grimaldi!'" [...] Another writer commented that his performances elevated his role by [...] "acute observation upon the foibles and absurdities of society. ... He is the finest practical satyrist that ever existed. ... He was so extravagantly natural, that [...] ashamed to laugh till tears coursed down their cheeks at Joe and his comicalities." [...] The British dramatist James Planché worried, in a rhymed couplet, that Grimaldi's death meant {{the end of a}} genre: [...] "Pantomime's best days are fled; Grimaldi, Barnes, Bologna dead!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bullets {{will reach}} <b>him</b> if <b>we</b> can't, so blaze away, boys, and finish <b>him</b> off. <b>We</b> have fooled away time enough, and I {{want to get}} home to supper," [...] said the leader of the hunt, after many {{attempts}} had been made to lure or drive Tom from his shelter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Faith, Madame!"
