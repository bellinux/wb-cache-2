40|$|Non-destructive {{testing for}} drying defects in Eucalyptus grandis utility poles {{would be highly}} advantageous. These defects can {{negatively}} affect creosote preservative treatment and in-service performance. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess correlations between drying defects such as surface checking, honeycombing, collapse, their parameters and moisture content (MC) gradient in poles, to possibly find a simple and quick but reliable method to assess internal and external drying defects. Defects and moisture content gradients were measured in 39 kiln-dried E. grandis poles. After measuring surface check length, width and depth using a measuring tape, a ruler and a depth gauge, destructive sampling at the theoretical ground line (TGL) was done to measure the MC gradient between the shell and core of poles. Digital image analysis of cross-sections of discs cut at TGL was used to measure <b>honeycomb</b> <b>check</b> width, length and area, as well as counting individual closed surface checks. Collapse was assessed using qualitative methods. Results showed that honeycombing and collapse were positively, and surface checking and MC gradient were negatively correlated. Surface check width, length and depth were also correlated. Honeycomb count, check width, length and area were strongly correlated. It was concluded that measuring any of these surface check and/ or honeycomb parameters may give meaningful deductions about the extent of surface checking and honeycombing respectively...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{specific}} cases, kiln drying {{prior to}} preservative treatment is the prescribed method of utility pole seasoning in South Africa. The slow drying nature of Eucalyptus grandis poles makes rapid kiln drying potentially detrimen-tal due to development of defects such as excessive surface <b>checking,</b> <b>honeycomb</b> and collapse. To control these defects {{while maintaining the}} fastest drying rate possible, the effect of drying schedule on the drying quality of E. grandis poles was investigated. Full length pole drying was simulated in thirty 2. 1 m long butt sections of poles of which the top ends were end sealed. Three industrially used schedules that differed in dry and wet bulb temperature and duration of drying (Tdb, Twb and time) were chosen: 80 °C/ 59 °C/ 8 days, 80 °C/ 69 °C/ 10 days and 70 °C/ 59 °C/ 12 days. Surface check length of each pole was measured after drying. Cross-sections cut at the theoretical ground line (TGL), 1. 5 m from the butt end, were {{used to measure the}} moisture content (MC) gradient between the shell and core of poles. Digital image analysis of cross-sections of discs cut at TGL was used to measure the area of honeycomb and disc cross-section. Collapse was assessed qualitatively. With all three schedules, MC’s in the pole cores at the end of drying were still very high. Some poles were above 25 % in the outer 25 mm of the treatable zone. The 70 °C/ 59 °C/ 12 days schedule generated the highest surface check total length. A reduction in the wet bulb depression o...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{efficiency}} of a Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plant {{depends on the}} effectiveness of Thermal Energy Storage (TES) system. A Single tank TES system has potential to provide effective solution. In a single tank TES system, a thermocline region, which produces the temperature gradient between hot and cold storage fluid by density difference, is used. Preservation of this thermocline region in the tank during charging and discharging cycles depends on the uniformity of the velocity profile at any horizontal plane. One of the major challenges for the single tank thermocline is actually maintaining the thermocline region in the tank, so that it does not spread out to occupy the entire tank. Since the thermocline is a horizontal surface, the hot and cold fluid must be introduce {{in such a way that}} it does not disturb the thermocline. If the fluid is introduced in a jet stream, it will disturb the thermocline and mix the hot and cold fluids into a homogeneous medium. So the objective of this thesis is to preserve the thermocline region by maximizing the uniformity of the velocity distribution. An ideal distributor will minimize the thermocline spreading and hence maximize the useable form of thermal energy storage in a single tank system. The performance of two different types of distributors: pipe flow distributor and <b>honeycomb</b> distributor, were <b>checked.</b> The effectiveness of the pipe flow distributor was checked by varying the dimension of the geometry i. e. number of holes, distance between the holes, position of the holes and number of distributor pipes. ^ Thermal energy storage system from solar power relies on high temperature thermal storage units for continuous operation. The storage units should have facilitated with high thermal conductivity and heat capacity storage fluid. Hence it is necessary to find a better performing heat transfer fluid at higher operating temperature. Novel materials such as nanomaterial additives can become cost effective and can increase the operating range of the storage facilities to higher range of temperatures. In this work Hitec® molten salt is considered as the heat transfer fluid (HTF). The operating temperature of this HTF is 300 - 500 °C. So to increase the thermal properties of this HTF nanomaterial has been added. The effective thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of the nanofluid were calculated and the thermal effect of this nanofluid was observed from the simulation result. ...|$|R
