30|$|Electrochemical {{experiments}} and corrosion tests {{were carried out}} using an IVIUM potentiostat (IVIUM Technologies, Fernandina Beach, FL, USA) connected to a computer through a USB cable and a conventional three-electrode cell. The cell was equipped with a steel electrode as the working electrode (WE), and the counter and reference electrodes were platinum wire and saturated calomel electrodes (SCE), respectively. In order to establish a steady state from open circuit potential (OCP), the working electrodes were first immersed into the test solution for 30  min. The potentiodynamic polarization curves were recorded at a scan rate of 1  mV/s in the potential range from − 150 to + 150  mV relative to the OCP. For linear polarization resistance measurement, {{the potential of the}} electrodes was scanned from − 15 to + 15  mV around OCP with 0.5  mV/s scan rate. The EIS measurements were performed at corrosion potentials over a frequency range of 100 KHz to 0.1  Hz with AC signal amplitude perturbation of ± 10  mV. The electrochemical measurements in the hydrodynamic conditions were measured using an <b>electrode</b> <b>controller</b> (model: AFMSRCE, PINE Instruments Co., Durham, NC, USA) to control the rotation speed in the range (500 to 2, 000  rpm) in the absence and presence of the inhibitor of various concentrations. EIS Analyzer Software was used to fit the experimental results of EIS measurements using appropriate equivalent circuit. Each measurement data point as shown in the figures and tables was performed at least three times, and reproducibility was satisfactory.|$|E

40|$|This {{chapter is}} an attempt to {{illustrate}} the development of a mathematical model of an industrial process by combining analytical modelling techniques with a system identification study. Although both these approaches can often be applied in isolation to develop a mathematical description of a process the lack of detailed knowledge of the high power arc discharge suggests a combination of these techniques {{in the case of an}} electric arc furnace. The objective of the present study is to develop three-phase models of both arc impedance and arc current controlled electric arc furnaces. Initially, a single-phase model of the <b>electrode</b> position <b>controller,</b> arc discharge and furnace transmission system are developed for an arc impedance controlled furnace using analytical modelling techniques and assuming zero interaction between the three regulators. Th assumptions and approximations associated with this model are investigated by designing experiments and conducting tests on a production arc furnace. Properties of the arc discharge, interaction between the regulators and a pulse transfer function representation of the <b>electrode</b> position <b>controller</b> are identified. These results are extended and three-phase models of an arc impedance and arc current controlled electric arc furnace are derived...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{simplified}} {{model order}} reduction techniques relying solely on neglecting relatively large system poles is re-examined. The case is made that, whilst the limited {{success rate of}} such an approach may not {{in the past have}} justified the time spent in testing the performance of models so produced, the advent of fast, simple to use, interactive simulation languages now makes this simple method much more attractive as a first try. The good results which simple techniques can achieve is shown by application to a tenth order model of an electronic arc furnace <b>electrode</b> position <b>controller.</b> This is reduced to a sixth order model by the simple technique and also by a mathematically rigorous plane-projection method. A comparison of the resulting models shows that the one produced simply is just as good and avoids the mathematical complexity of other techniques...|$|R

40|$|There {{are several}} process {{variables}} which {{are crucial to}} the control of vacuum arc remelting of segregation sensitive alloys. These are: electrode gap, melt rate, cooling rate, furnace annulus, furnace atmosphere and electrode quality (i. e. cleanliness and integrity). Of these variables, active, closed loop control is usually applied only to electrode gap. Other variables are controlled by controlling furnace operational parameters to preset schedules (e. g. melting current is ramped or held constant to control melt rate in an open loop fashion), through proper maintenance and calibration of equipment (e. g. to ensure proper cooling water and gas flow rates, or to accomplish an acceptable vacuum leak rate), through proper practice of procedures, and by maintaining electrode quality control. Electrode gap control is accomplished by controlling an electrode gap indicator such as drip-short frequency (or period) to a specified set-point. This type of control, though often adequate, ignores information available from other electrode gap indicators and is susceptible to upsets. A multiple input <b>electrode</b> gap <b>controller</b> is described which uses optimal estimation techniques to address this problem...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} an {{efficient}} control strategy will usually require a suitable model representing both the steady-state and dynamic {{performance of the}} process. In most practical problems {{the complexity of the}} process usually dictates a complicated theoretical model which is not readily compatible with the need to design simple regulators. However, the majority of high order and stochastic effects that characterise the operation of a large dynamic complex system can frequently be represented in terms of simple dynamic models which can be readily used to design suitable controllers. Identification can often be used to estimate such models from input/output data records and gives further knowledge and insight of the process and its environment. Effective data handling and estimation programs are necessary for efficient identification and the present study describes the development of an identification package SPAID-Sheffield Package for the Analysis and Identification of Data. The package which has been written for a CONPAC 4020 process computer, consists of several suites of programs for logging, data handling and modification, parameter estimation, model validity tests, simulation and plotting. The programs are interactive via a graphics display terminal with user intervention to control the identification procedure.

50|$|Resistance {{seam welding}} {{is a process}} that {{produces}} a weld at the faying surfaces of two similar metals. The seam may be a butt joint or an overlap joint and is usually an automated process. It differs from butt welding in that butt welding typically welds the entire joint at once and seam welding forms the weld progressively, starting at one end. Like spot welding, seam welding relies on two electrodes, usually made from copper, to apply pressure and current. The electrodes are often disc shaped and rotate as the material passes between them. This allows the electrodes to stay in constant contact with the material to make long continuous welds. The electrodes may also move or assist the movement of the material. A transformer supplies energy to the weld joint in the form of low voltage, high current AC power. The joint of the work piece has high electrical resistance relative {{to the rest of the}} circuit and is heated to its melting point by the current. The semi-molten surfaces are pressed together by the welding pressure that creates a fusion bond, resulting in a uniformly welded structure. Most seam welders use water cooling through the <b>electrode,</b> transformer and <b>controller</b> assemblies due to the heat generated.|$|R
40|$|Machine {{collaboration}} with the biological body/brain by sending electrical information back and forth {{is one of the}} leading research areas in neuro-engineering during the twenty-first century. Hence, Brain-Machine-Brain Interface (BMBI) is a powerful tool for achieving such machine-brain/body collaboration. BMBI generally is a smart device (usually invasive) that can record, store, and analyze neural activities, and generate corresponding responses in the form of electrical pulses to stimulate specific brain regions. The Smart Brain-Machine-Brain-Interface (SBMBI) is a step forward with compared to the traditional BMBI by including smart functions, such as in-electrode local computing capabilities, and availability of cloud connectivity in the system to take the advantage of powerful cloud computation in decision making. In this dissertation work, we designed and developed an innovative form of Smart Brain-Machine-Brain Interface (SBMBI) and studied its feasibility in different biomedical applications. With respect to power management, the SBMBI is a semi-passive platform. The communication module is fully passive—powered by RF harvested energy; whereas, the signal processing core is battery-assisted. The efficiency of the implemented RF energy harvester was measured to be 0. 005 %. One of potential applications of SBMBI is to configure a Smart Deep-Brain-Stimulator (SDBS) based on the general SBMBI platform. The SDBS consists of brain-implantable smart electrodes and a wireless-connected external <b>controller.</b> The SDBS <b>electrodes</b> operate as completely autonomous electronic implants that are capable of sensing and recording neural activities in real time, performing local processing, and generating arbitrary waveforms for neuro-stimulation. A bidirectional, secure, fully-passive wireless communication backbone was designed and integrated into this smart electrode to maintain contact between the smart <b>electrodes</b> and the <b>controller.</b> The standard EPC-Global protocol has been modified and adopted as the communication protocol in this design. The proposed SDBS, by using a SBMBI platform, was demonstrated and tested through a hardware prototype. Additionally the SBMBI was employed to develop a low-power wireless ECG data acquisition device. This device captures cardiac pulses through a non-invasive magnetic resonance electrode, processes the signal and sends it to the backend computer through the SBMBI interface. Analysis was performed to verify the integrity of received ECG data...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: {{functional}} {{electrical stimulation}} (FES) has shown effectiveness in restoring movement post-stroke {{when applied to}} as-sist patients’ voluntary intention during repeated, motivating tasks. However, most commercial upper-limb FES prod-ucts assist only few muscles and do not use position sensor feedback to adjust the FES. Recent clinical trials have em-ployed advanced controllers that precisely adjust stimulation applied to three muscle groups in order to assist functional reach and grasp tasks, giving rise to statistically significant reduction in impairment. This paper describes the system, focusing on the innovative sensing technology, <b>electrode</b> array based <b>controller</b> and associated hardware. Methods: stroke participants (N= 4) undertook seventeen intervention sessions, each of one hour duration. During each session FES {{was applied to the}} anterior deltoid and triceps via single electrodes, and wrist/finger extensors via an electrode ar-ray to assist participants in performing functional tasks with real objects and virtual reality functional reaching tasks. These comprised: 1) pressing low or high light switches, 2) closing a drawer, 3) grasping-replacing-releasing an object. Kinematic data were extracted using a Microsoft Kinect and PrimeSense, and mechanical arm support was provided by a SaeboMAS. An advanced model-based iterative learning controller used kinematic data from previous attempts at each task to update the FES applied to each muscle on the subsequent trial. This produced stimulation profiles that facil-itate accurate completion of each task while encouraging voluntary effort by the participant. Participants completed clinical assessments (Fugl-Meyer and Action Research Arm Test) pre- and post-intervention, as well as FES-unassisted tasks during each intervention session. Results: feasibility was established in preliminary tests with unimpaired participants (N= 2) who provided no voluntary effort. These confirmed high levels of performance over a range of functional tasks. For the case of stroke participants, results showed that FES-assisted performance increased {{over the course of the}} intervention for a range of functional tasks. Sta-tistically significant improvements were also observed in FES-unassisted tasks over the course of the intervention. In particular, range of movement (ROM) increased at the shoulder, elbow, wrist and index finger joints over a range of tasks; the high light switch demonstrated the most significant gain in shoulder flexion ROM, the contralateral reach in elbow extension ROM, the near reach in wrist extension ROM and the far reach in index finger extension ROM. Conclusion: the feasibility of applying precisely controlled FES to multiple muscle groups in the upper limb using advanced sen-sors, controllers and array hardware was demonstrated. This technology is expected to lead to significant reductions in upper-limb impairment following chronic stroke. This compact low-cost rehabilitation technology also has potential for future transfer to patients’ homes...|$|R
