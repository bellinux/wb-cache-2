500|$|Stevens is {{a proponent}} of using {{statistical}} analysis to enhance his coaching decisions, spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film. [...] "I think it's a unique {{way of looking at}} the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players", he explains. For example, when Butler was slumping in late 2010, Stevens challenged his team: [...] "this [...] <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b> This isn't acceptable to get to where we want to go. But what does that really mean? It's not just get better defensively, it is, if we give up 3 less baskets a game, then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country". The team got the message, improved throughout the season, and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense. In 2012, Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff. If he had the resources, Stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the teams play.|$|E

6000|$|... {{like that}} wielded by the awful shape which Dion the Syracusan saw? I make the {{suggestion}} modestly, though somewhat encouraged by Mr. Masson's system of exegesis, which reminds {{one of the}} casuists' doctrine of probables, in virtue of which a man may be probabiliter obligatus and probabiliter deobligatus at the same time. But perhaps the most remarkable instance of Mr. Masson's figures of speech <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> told that the king might have established a bona fide government [...] "by giving public ascendency to the popular or Parliamentary element in his Council, and inducing the old leaven in it either to accept the new policy, or to withdraw and become inactive." [...] There is something consoling in the thought that yeast should be accessible to moral suasion. It is really too bad that bread should ever be heavy for want of such an appeal to its moral sense as should [...] "induce it to accept the new policy." [...] Of Mr. Masson's unhappy infection with the vivid style an instance or two shall be given in justification {{of what has been}} alleged against him in that particular. He says of London that [...] "he was committed to the Tower, where for more than two months he lay, with as near a prospect as ever prisoner had of a chop with the executioner's axe on a scaffold on Tower Hill." [...] I may be over-fastidious, but the word [...] "chop" [...] offends my ears with its coarseness, or if that be too strong, has certainly the unpleasant effect of an emphasis unduly placed. Old Auchinleck's saying of Cromwell, that [...] "he gart kings ken they had a lith in their necks," [...] {{is a good example of}} really vivid phrase, suggesting the axe and the block, and giving one of those dreadful hints to the imagination which are more powerful than any amount of detail, and whose skilful use is the only magic employed by the masters of truly picturesque writing. The sentence just quoted will serve also as an example of that tendency to surplusage, which adds to the bulk of Mr. Masson's sentences at the cost of their effectiveness. If he had said simply [...] "chop on Tower Hill" [...] (if chop there must be), it had been quite enough, for we all know that the executioner's axe and the scaffold are implied in it. Once more, and I have done with the least agreeable part of my business. Mr. Masson, after telling over again the story of Strafford with needless length of detail, ends thus: [...] "On Wednesday, the 12th of May, that proud curly head, the casket of that brain of power, rolled on the scaffold of Tower Hill." [...] Why curly? Surely it is here a ludicrous impertinence. This careful thrusting forward of outward and unmeaning particulars, in the hope of giving that reality to a picture which genius only has the art to do, is becoming a weariness in modern descriptive writing. It reminds one of the Mrs. Jarley expedient of dressing the waxen effigies of murderers in the very clothes they wore when they did the deed, or with the real halter round their necks wherewith they expiated it. It is probably very effective with the torpid sensibilities of the class who look upon wax figures as works of art. True imaginative power works with other material. Lady Macbeth striving to wash away from her hands the damned spot that is all the more there to the mind of the spectator because it is not there at all, is a type of the methods it employs and the intensity of their action.|$|E
