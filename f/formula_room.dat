40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for calculating fire resistance of axially loaded Concrete-Filled Steel Tube (CFST) columns with different section profiles, including circular and polygonal sections {{that can be}} solid and hollow. The uniqueness of this new method is that the fire resistance is calculated {{on the basis of}} the average temperature of the columns’ cross-sections. This is done by taking the bearing capacity of a CFST column at room temperature as a special case of the bearing capacity of the same column at the start of a fire. The equivalent strength and equivalent elastic modulus in relation to the average temperature of steel and concrete are investigated, and a unified method of calculation is proposed, by which the calculation of fire resistance of a CFST column can be divided into two steps, i. e. (a) calculation of the equivalent strength and elastic modulus of steel and concrete at elevated temperature based on the average temperature, and (b) calculation of fire resistance using the <b>formulas</b> at <b>room</b> temperature by replacing the equivalent material strength and elastic modulus at elevated temperature. The two sets of formulas for calculating fire resistance of CFST columns are given by combining the unified method, respectively, with Eurocode 4 and the authors’ previous work.

The molecular structure of 1 is made of a three-dimensional (3 D) anionic network [Mn 2 (C 2 O 4) 3]n 2 n− and tris-chelated cations [Cu(bpy) 3] 2 + occupying the vacancies of the framework. In compound 1 magnetic order is confirmed below 12. 8 K – magnetization measurements reveal an antiferromagnetic- like network of canted Mn 2 + spins with incorporated paramagnetic Cu 2 + centres. The ESR spectroscopy distinctly shows the phase transition; above T ≈ 13 K, single isotropic Lorentzian lines of Mn 2 + ions in the high spin state S = 5 / 2 were observed, while below this temperature, only characteristic Cu 2 + signals from cations were detected. Thermal decomposition residues of 1 at different temperatures (800 – 1000 °C) were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction; by heating the sample up to 1000 °C the spinel oxide CuMn 2 O 4 [94. 1 (2) wt%] was formed.

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on November 15, 2013). The thesis builds on recent ideas that combine work by C. B. Morrey (1955) and D. W.

In particular, it is shown that sufficient assumptions for rigorous, non phenomenological, macroscopic equations for mass and momentum as {{the limit of}} Hamiltonian dynamics are indeed satisfied by a class of initial conditions and rescalings of interaction potentials, including all 1 =rp, p > 3 potentials. The total energy equation is also obtained. The averages naturally defined by this method are shown to be abstract Reynolds averages {{in the sense of}} Kampe' de Feriet, Rota, and Moy, both in terms of abstract Reynolds properties and as conditional expectations with respect to the correct σ-algebra. Further, a close examination of the disintegration theorem provides justification for Reynolds's insistence on space averages. Finally, a certain approximation of the non-linear velocity term, close to equilibrium and in terms of Hermite polynomials, satisfi es Landau-Lifschitz type <b>formulas,</b> ostensibly leaving <b>room</b> for non-thermal fluctuations. With an eye to applications and insisting on space averages, the thesis avoids Gibbs ensembles and the Liouville equation, as well as the Boltzmann equation.

40|$|This work aims {{to cover}} a variety of aspects {{relating}} to the Higher Manganese Silicide (HMS) system, e. g. composites, substitutions, synthesis methods, and structural evolutions. The composites made of HMS-based compounds and nano-inclusions have been prepared via two different procedures, i. e. (i) solid state reaction, manually mixing, and hot pressing, or (ii) soft ball milling and reactive spark plasma sintering. The later approach has proved its effectiveness in preparing the multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) /HMS-based material composites mainly containing the HMS phases with a homogeneous distribution of MWCNTs. It was demonstrated that a fine distribution of the nano-inclusions {{played a crucial role}} in reducing thermal conductivity through enhancing phonon scattering in HMS-based materials, resulting in an improvement by about 20 % for the maximum efficiency for the MWCNT/HMS-based material composite with 1. 0 wt. -% MWCNTs. The substitution of molybdenum, tungsten, or silver at the Mn sites, and of germanium or aluminium at the Si sites has been studied for the HMS-based materials. The best thermoelectric efficiency among different Ge contents was achieved for the phase mixture of the non-stoichiometric composition MnSi 1. 75 Ge 0. 02, which was then chosen to be the base material for further substitutions. No crucial modification of the electrical properties of the base material was observed, but large decreases of lattice thermal conductivity were achieved because of enhanced phonon scattering, with the highest reduction up to 25 % for molybdenum substitution. The maximum figure of merit, ZT, value was approximately 0. 40 for the material with 2 at. -% molybdenum substitution at the Mn sites. The maximum ZT values ranging from 0. 31 to 0. 42 have been achieved for various compositions prepared by mechanical alloying, mechanical milling and heat treating in conventional furnace, as well as by solid state reaction, which could possibly be improved by completely eliminating the side products. Subsequently, a simple and effective process was used to synthesize undoped HMS, involving ball milling in n-hexane under soft conditions to obtain homogeneous mixtures of constituting elements, and subsequent spark plasma sintering for a direct solid state reaction. The obtained fine particles after the milling process in n-hexane helped to improve the reaction rate later on, resulting in pure HMS materials. As a consequence, the maximum thermoelectric figure of merit obtained was 0. 55 at 850 K, a high value for undoped HMS. Moreover, single crystals of HMS have been prepared using chemical vapor transport with very low yield, but their poor qualities resulted in low resolution in single crystal XRD. HMS-based materials including the ones with different Si/Mn atomic ratios and various dopants, e. g. Ge, Al, Cr, and Mo, have been prepared for the investigation of structural evolution upon heating up from room temperature to high temperature. The average structural <b>formula</b> at <b>room</b> temperature and its temperature dependence were strongly impacted by the phase compositions of the starting materials as well as the nature of dopants. Physical property measurements on the MnSi 1. 75 compound revealed that a correlation between the thermoelectric properties and the average structural formula of bulk HMS-based materials could be expected...|$|R
40|$| {{investigation}} and {{determination of the}} possible effects of different storage conditions, including on-going stability conditions and accelerated stability conditions, on the physicochemical properties of optimized S. argel tablets. In quality assurance studies, stability {{is defined as the}} extent to which a product retains, within specified limits, and through its period of storage and use, i. e. its shelflife, the same properties and characteristics that it possessed at the time of its manufacture. Accelerated stability testing are studies designed to increase the rate of chemical degradation and physical change of drug by using exaggerated storage conditions; they should be used consistentlythroughout a particular stability study. These stability tests were carried out by placing 100 tablets of each <b>formula</b> at <b>room</b> temperature at 30 o C± 15 o C and RH 60 %± 15 %; in an incubator at 37 o C± 2 o C and RH 70 %± 5 %; and in another incubator at 50 °C± 5 °C and RH 70 %± 5 %, for intervals extending from 6 months to 48 months. Evaluation of the physicochemical properties was done at zero time, and at the specified time intervals. The results were tabulated for each formula. Physicochemical characters and properties changes evaluated included: uniformity of weight, diameter, thickness, microbial growth, tablet hardness, friability, disintegration time, dissolution rate of tablet constituents, powder contents estimation with time, and mottling, capping, and lamination. In certain formulae of the tested tablets, there were changes in the hardness, odour, friability and powder contents. Questionnaire (II) was used to evaluate the practice of using herbal medicines as antispasmodic remedy, and revealed the effectiveness of the medicinal herbs used, with 60 % of the participants feeling completely relieved of pain after a single administration of the medicinal herb, and 26 % used the drug several times due to repeated attacks of pain. With regard to the types of herbal preparations used, 45 % used decoctions, 38 % used powder type, and 17 % used macerated plants preparations. Clinical investigations included evaluation of safety and efficacy of Solenostemma argel tablets, and determination of any possible side effects, adverse reactions or toxic manifestations at therapeutic dosage regimen in ten healthy male volunteers. This was followed by evaluation of therapeutic effectiveness and side effects of S. argeltablets in a group of hundred patients with different clinical complains mainly gastro-intestinal tract colics, or urinogenital tract spasms and menstrual pain. None of these subjects, healthy or patient, complained of any serious side effects or toxic reactions. XII Ten healthy male subjects participated in these clinical trials after signing a written consent, and were subjected to a medical examination and follow up by a clinician. The trials were started with low doses, e. g. one tablet three times daily, and gradually increased till the highest dose of four tablets three times a day for each of the leaves, extracts or alkaloids tablets was attained. The volunteers were monitored for the occurrence of any side effects or adverse reactions. None of the volunteers complained of blurred vision, dryness of the mouth, tachycardia or bradycardia, palpitation, headache or vomiting during the period of the trial. Only one of these subjects complained of dryness of the mouth and another subject complained of stomach upset felt at the time of administration ofSolenostemma argelleaves tablets. The clinical trials were organized in three teaching hospitals under the supervision of four clinicians. Randomly selected 100 patients, 20 - 70 years old and 40 males and 60 females, were complaining of abdominal disturbances, and diagnosed as having gastritis, indigestion, heartburn, flatulence, irritable bowel syndrome, renal colics, or colics due to menstrual pain. These patients were treated by using two tablets of Solenostemma argelleaves or extracts administered when necessary. They were followed up for therapeutic effectiveness of the administered tablets as indicated by the relief of pain and colics, and monitored for occurrence of side effects or adverse reactions. When necessary, another two-tablet dose was administered to patients when there was recurrence of pain or colics. The general observation in treatment of gastrointestinal disturbances with Solenostemma argeltablets was the quick suppression of symptoms and relief of pain occurring immediately following drug administration. However, in the case of renal colics, pain associated with menstrual disturbances, and irritable bowel syndrome, IBS, there might be a need for repetition of the treatment. In most cases, the pain was relieved without any pronounced side effects or adverse reactions. Different types of Solenostemma argeltablets showed a very good therapeutic effectiveness (71 %- 100 %), and a great margin of safety (98 %- 100 %). Forty patients with diagnosed irritable bowel syndrome were treated with placebo tablets (5 % pain relief), generic antispasmodic tablets (90 %), and Solenostemma argel leaves (71 %) or extract (88 %) tablets. Solenostemma argelextract tablets had a quicker onset of action and were more effective than the equivalent leaves tablets. No side effects were recorded with extract tablets, but in two patients mild stomach upset was recorded with leaves tablets. Accordingly, Solenostemma argeltablets, especially those of the extract or alkaloid, would be useful in relieving IBS associated pain by administering two tablets half an hour before meals. Success of the present project and implementation of its findings may pave the way for other projects to be designed and conducted for further utilization of other useful medicinal plants used in folkloric practices...|$|R
