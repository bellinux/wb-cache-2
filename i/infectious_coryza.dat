40|$|Objective: To characterise 18 {{isolates}} of Haemophilus paragallinarum {{isolated from}} chickens in Indonesia. Procedure: The isolates were identified to species level by traditional phenotypic methods. Six of the isolates were also identified by a species-specific polymerase chain reaction. Fourteen of the isolates were examined for resistance to {{a panel of}} seven antimicrobial agents using a disc diffusion method. All 18 isolates were serotyped according to the Page scheme using reference antisera in a haemagglutination inhibition test. Results: Four of the 18 isolates were obtained from indigenous (kampung) chickens, with the remainder being from typical intensive poultry production systems. The 18 isolates were obtained from 11 outbreaks that showed the typical clinical signs of <b>infectious</b> <b>coryza</b> and 11 of the isolates were obtained from chickens that had been vaccinated with <b>infectious</b> <b>coryza</b> vaccines. All 18 isolates were confirmed as H paragallinarumby biochemical testing and six isolates were also identified as H paragallinarum by the polymerase chain reaction test. Eleven isolates were resistant to erythromycin and streptomycin, 10 to neomycin, eight to oxytetracycline, five isolates to doxycycline, three to sulphamethoxazoltrimethoprim but only one to ampicillin. Seven isolates were Page serovar A, four were Page serovar B and seven were Page serovar C. Conclusion: The presence of all three Page serovars (A, B and C) has been confirmed {{for the first time}} in Indonesian chickens. As the majority of the <b>infectious</b> <b>coryza</b> vaccines in use in Indonesia contain only serovar A and C, the presence of serovar B in chickens indicates that the protection by these bivalent vaccines would be reduced.

Polyclonal antibody directed against A. paragallinarum strain 0083 (serovar A) was used as the target antibody and phage clones binding to this target were screened from the 12 -mer random peptide library. More than 50 % of the phage clones selected in the third round carried the consensus peptide motif sequence A-DP(M) L.

In order to detect antigenic changes between populations of H. paragallinarum isolated before the use of vaccines against <b>infectious</b> <b>coryza</b> in this country, and field isolates obtained after the introduction of <b>infectious</b> <b>coryza</b> vaccines, 106 different NAD-dependent isolates (of which 93 were identified as H. paragallinarum) from 63 different farms, and dating from 1972 to March 1995, were identified by means of rabbit antisera against serogroups A, B and C. Serogroup C isolates show weaker cross-protection, requiring the further subdivision of this serogroup into its four different serovars. The percentages of the different serovars obtained in the 1970 s, confirmed previously published data on South African isolates. A tendency towards {{a decrease in the}} number of serogroup A and serovar C- 2 isolates, and an increase in the percentage of serovar C- 3 isolates, was noted among isolates of the 1980 s. These changes were markedly enhanced in the isolates obtained from 1990 to March 1995. The percentage of serogroup A isolates decreased significantly from 34 % in the 1970 s to only 5 % in the 1990 s, and that of serovar C- 2 isolates, from 31 - 18 %, while the abundance of serovar C- 3 isolates increased significantly from 31 % in the 1970 s to 73 % in the 1990 s. Serogroup B remained more or less constant and never reached more than 10 % of the population. These results indicate the need for the incorporation of serovar C- 3 in a vaccine for use in South Africa, particularly in those areas of the country from which isolates were collected during this study.

Onderstepoort oil-adjuvanted vaccines have been formulated with the old Freund’s formulation, using surfactants that are not always compliant with current regulatory requirements. Other disadvantages associated with use of the traditional Freund’s formulation include safety in vaccinated animals, unavailability of certain reagents or components, as well as their impact to the cost of the final vaccine. The present study was designed to assess four oil-adjuvanted Onderstepoort vaccines, i. e. the E. coli, the enterotoxaemia or Pulpy kidney, the Vibrio or Campylobacter fetus and the <b>Infectious</b> <b>coryza</b> vaccines. The first three vaccines are formulated with a surfactant that is no longer readily available and is not registered by regulatory authorities, while the surfactant used in the <b>Infectious</b> <b>coryza</b> vaccine tends to result in adverse reactions in vaccinated chickens. The traditional liquid paraffin Marcol was compared to two new liquid paraffin white oils (PFP 8 and PFP 14), while the traditional emulsifiers Cirrasol EN-MP® and Arlacel® were compared to two new products, Montanide 103 ™ and Simulsol-P 2 ®. In addition, Cirrasol EN-MP® was compared to Arlacel®, {{given the fact that the}} latter is an approved emulsifier for use in animal vaccines. Two ready-to-use emulsifiers, i. e. Montanide™ ISA 70 VG and Montanide™ ISA 206, were also tested with the <b>Infectious</b> <b>coryza</b> vaccine. The three liquid paraffins and four surfactants were evaluated for their physical characteristics, as well as their ability to generate a safe and effective vaccine when formulated with the above four vaccine antigens. The safety and efficacy of the different formulations were evaluated in both laboratory animals and target animals, i. e. sheep, cattle and chicken. The results obtained can be summarized as follows. (i) The two new liquid paraffins had similar physical characteristics as the traditional Marcol, and they also did not cause adverse reactions in vaccinated animals; (ii) Simulsol-P 2 ® displayed a poor ability to form a stable emulsion for the above vaccines; (iii) Montanide 103 ™ was stable and was safe in most of the vaccines, but caused persistent local reactions in the E. coli vaccine; and (iv) the Arlacel® formulations were stable, safe and showed better immunogenicity profiles as compared to the other formulations.

40|$|Haemophilus paragallinarum causes <b>infectious</b> <b>coryza</b> in poultry, and a {{panel of}} {{monoclonal}} antibodies (Mabs) were established, which detect surface antigens of this bacterium. It was postulated that these Mabs {{could be used to}} detect antigenic differences between strains of H. paragallinarum used in <b>infectious</b> <b>coryza</b> (IC) vaccines, and isolates made from the field, from poultry vaccinated against IC. It has previously been reported that in South Africa there are three different Mab patterns that have been common to H. paragallinarum isolates for the past three decades. The effects of different growth conditions such as duration of incubation, inoculum size, levels of NAD or NaCI in the medium, and the pH of the medium on these Mab patterns were investigated. It was found that many different factors appear to influence the expression of the antigens detected by the panel of Mabs. It was found that at different stages during the growth cycles, the isolates could be classified into different Mab groups. It was also found that alteration of the inoculum size resulted in Mab-pattern switches. Addition of extra NaCI to the medium, in order to slow the growth rate, was found to result in Mab-pattern switches. pH was found to have signifcant effects on the levels of expression of the antigens detected by the Mabs, although these changes did not result in Mab-pattern switches. The effects of pH were also found to be highly strain dependent. The use of NAD, rather than sterile chicken serum, in the medium did not significantly alter the levels of expression of these antigens. Alterations of the growth conditions greatly affected the levels of expression of the antigens detected by the Mabs, and were highly strain dependent. It was not possible to predict the effects of a particular growth condition on a particular strain or isolate of H. paragallinarum.

40|$|There {{are four}} {{currently}} recognized taxa {{to accommodate the}} avian haemophili: Haemophilus paragallinarum, Pasteurella avium, Pasteurella volantium, and Pasteurella species A (the last three being formerly united as Haemophilus avium). A range of other taxa has also been recognized, {{but they have been}} neither named nor assigned to a genus. All of these various taxa, legitimate and otherwise, have the common characteristic of requiring V factor, but not X factor, for in vitro growth. Several recent studies have established the phenotypic properties that allow the differentiation of the recognized taxa, both named and unnamed. The serological properties of H. paragallinarum, the causative agent of <b>infectious</b> <b>coryza</b> of chickens, has received considerable recent attention. In contrast, many questions on the pathogenicity and virulence mechanisms of H. paragallinarum remain unanswered. Another area requiring further work is the identification of those antigens responsible for inducing protective immunity in vaccinated or naturally infected chickens...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{production}} and characterisation of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against Haemophilus paragallinarum, the causative agent of <b>infectious</b> <b>coryza.</b> A bank of 8 MAbs were produced by traditional techniques –– four against the reference strain for Page serovar A (0083) and four against the reference strain for Page serovar C (Modesto). Seven of the eight MAbs were shown to be IgG 1 with one being nontypable. None of the MAbs had HI activity and none gave any detectable reaction when examined by Western blotting. None of the MAbs gave a positive reaction in the indirect ELISA {{with any of the}} eight type strains of Pasteurella species or sub-species. None of our 8 MAbs gave serovar specific reactions when used in an indirect ELISA format. There was a trend for the serovar A MAbs to give a higher titre with serovar A isolates/strains and a similar trend for the serovar C MAbs to give higher titres with the serovar C isolates/strains. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Avibacterium paragallinarum, the causative {{agent of}} <b>infectious</b> <b>coryza,</b> {{is a highly}} {{contagious}} respiratory acute disease of poultry, which affects commercial chickens, laying hens and broilers worldwide. Methodology: In this study, we performed the whole genome sequencing, assembly and annotation of a Peruvian isolate of A. paragallinarum. Genome was sequenced in a 454 GS FLX Titanium system. De novo assembly was performed and annotation was completed with GS De Novo Assembler 2. 6 using the H. influenzae str. F 3031 gene model. Manual curation of the genome was performed with Artemis. Putative function of genes was predicted with Blast 2 GO. Virulence factors were identified by comparison with the Virulence Factor Database.
