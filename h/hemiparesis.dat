5|$|Subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} {{may also}} occur {{in people who}} have had a head injury. Symptoms may include headache, decreased level of consciousness and <b>hemiparesis</b> (weakness of one side of the body). SAH is a frequent occurrence in traumatic brain injury, and carries a poor prognosis if it is associated with deterioration in the level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Spinal cord {{injuries}} {{are most often}} caused by physical trauma. Forces involved can be hyperflexion (forward movement of the head); hyperextension (backward movement); lateral stress (sideways movement); rotation (twisting of the head); compression (force along the axis of the spine downward from the head or upward from the pelvis); or distraction (pulling apart of the vertebrae). Traumatic SCI can result in contusion, compression, or stretch injury. It is a major risk of many types of vertebral fracture. Pre-existing asymptomatic congenital anomalies can cause major neurological deficits, such as <b>hemiparesis,</b> to result from otherwise minor trauma.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{finding is}} a false localizing sign, the so-called Kernohan's notch, which results from compression of the contralateral cerebral crus containing descending corticospinal and some corticobulbar tract fibers. This leads to Ipsilateral <b>hemiparesis</b> {{in reference to the}} herniation and contralateral <b>hemiparesis</b> with reference to the cerebral crus.|$|E
25|$|A {{frequently}} occurring {{motor deficit}} is left-sided <b>hemiparesis</b> (in strokes affecting the motor cortex). A less common motor deficit {{in this population}} is dysphagia.|$|E
25|$|Size of lesion: Patients {{with smaller}} lesions {{typically}} recover faster from neglect and <b>hemiparesis</b> (unilateral body weakness) than patients with larger lesions (Hier et al., 1983).|$|E
25|$|Residual motor deficits are {{estimated}} to remain in about 8 to 30% of cases, the range in severity from mild clumsiness to ataxia and <b>hemiparesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since, {{hemimegalencephaly}} {{is associated}} with severe seizures, <b>hemiparesis</b> and mental retardation, {{the result is a}} poor prognosis. In most cases, those diagnosed with this type of megalencephaly usually do not survive through adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with transcortical {{motor aphasia}} have similar deficits as {{expressive}} aphasia, except repetition ability remains intact. Auditory comprehension is generally fine for simple conversations, but declines rapidly for more complex conversations. It {{is associated with}} right <b>hemiparesis,</b> meaning {{that there can be}} paralysis of the patient's right face and arm.|$|E
25|$|Mortality of {{this disease}} varies but is {{generally}} much higher in children. Transplacental spread has been noted. Lifelong neurological defects such as deafness, emotional lability and <b>hemiparesis</b> may occur in those who have had central nervous system involvement. In known cases, some effects also include nausea, headache, fever, vomiting and sometimes swelling of the testicles.|$|E
25|$|ADEM has {{an abrupt}} onset and a {{monophasic}} course. Symptoms usually begin 1–3 weeks after infection. Major symptoms include fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, confusion, vision impairment, drowsiness, seizures and coma. Although initially {{the symptoms are}} usually mild, they worsen rapidly {{over the course of}} hours to days, with the average time to maximum severity being about four and a half days. Additional symptoms include <b>hemiparesis,</b> paraparesis, and cranial nerve palsies.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the interscalene block — {{which results}} in diaphragmatic <b>hemiparesis</b> in all {{subjects}} — only half of those who undergo supraclavicular block experience this side effect. Disadvantages of the supraclavicular block include the risk of pneumothorax, which {{is estimated to be}} between 1%4% when using paresthesia or peripheral nerve stimulator guided techniques. Ultrasound guidance allows the operator to visualize the first rib and the pleura, thereby helping to ensure that the needle does not puncture the pleura; this presumably reduces the risk of pneumothorax.|$|E
25|$|Other {{neurological}} {{symptoms include}} confusion, tremor, general muscle weakness, <b>hemiparesis</b> and paralysis of a limb. Parkinson-like movements might arise due to non-specific movement disorders and speech disorders. Individuals may also exhibit psychiatric {{symptoms such as}} irritability, psychotic reactions, aggressive behaviour, or apathy which can sometimes dominate the clinical diagnosis. Without treatment, the disease is invariably fatal, with progressive mental deterioration leading to coma, systemic organ failure, and death. An untreated infection with T. b. rhodesiense will cause death within months whereas an untreated infection with T. b. gambiense will cause death after several years. Damage caused in the neurological phase is irreversible.|$|E
25|$|She also {{suffered}} a stroke while on the team. She suffered aftereffects, such as <b>hemiparesis,</b> partial memory loss, and aphasia, but was making great strides towards recovery Despite this, while only partially recovered, {{she was able to}} save numerous civilians in the battle against Albion by possessing one of Albion's evil Captain Britains. She was recently reunited with the Exiles, including her lover Thunderbird who is no longer comatose. However her return to the Exiles is short, because after defeating Mad Jim Jaspers, Nocturne and Thunderbird leave to help their relationship grow and to help Nocturne more fully recover from her stroke. Along with Blink, they go to Heather's reality so Heather can keep track of Nocturne's health as she continues to recover from her stroke.|$|E
25|$|FHM signs overlap {{significantly}} {{with those of}} migraine with aura. In short, FHM is typified by migraine with aura associated with <b>hemiparesis</b> and, in FHM1, cerebellar degeneration. This cerebellar degeneration can result in episodic or progressive ataxia. FHM can also present with the same signs as benign familial infantile convulsions (BFIC) and alternating hemiplegia of childhood. Other symptoms are altered consciousness (in fact, some cases seem related to head trauma), gaze-evoked nystagmus and coma. Aura symptoms, such as numbness and blurring of vision, typically persist for 30–60 minutes, but can last for weeks and months. An attack resembles a stroke, but unlike a stroke, it resolves in time. These signs typically first manifest themselves in {{the first or second}} decade of life.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{examinations}} {{can be used}} {{to determine the extent of}} the syndrome and its severity. Fluorescein angiography is quite useful in diagnosing the disease, and the use of ultrasonography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are helpful in confirming the disease. Neuro-ophthalmic examinations reveal pupillary defects (see Marcus Gunn Pupil). Funduscopic examinations, examinations of the fundus of the eye, allow detection of arteriovenous malformations. Neurological examinations can determine <b>hemiparesis</b> and paresthesias. Malformations in arteriovenous connections and irregular functions in the veins may be distinguished by fluorescein angiographies. Cerebral angiography examinations may expose AVMs in the cerebrum. MRIs are also used in imaging the brain and can allow visualization of the optic nerve and any possible atrophy. MRI, CT, and cerebral angiography are all useful for investigating the extent and location of any vascular lesions that are affecting the brain. This is helpful in determining the extent of the syndrome.|$|E
500|$|Focal {{injuries}} often produce symptoms {{related to}} {{the functions of the}} damaged area. Research shows that the most common areas to have focal lesions in non-penetrating traumatic brain injury are the orbitofrontal cortex (the lower surface of the frontal lobes) and the anterior temporal lobes, areas that are involved in social behavior, emotion regulation, olfaction, and decision-making, hence the common social/emotional and judgment deficits following moderate-severe TBI. [...] Symptoms such as <b>hemiparesis</b> or aphasia can also occur when less commonly affected areas such as motor or language areas are, respectively, damaged.|$|E
2500|$|Unilateral (...) : on {{one side}} of the body. For example, {{unilateral}} paresis is <b>hemiparesis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Progression to hemiconvulsions or {{generalised}} tonic–clonic seizures [...] {{occurs in}} around half {{of children and}} hemiconvulsions may be followed by postictal Todd’s <b>hemiparesis</b> [...]|$|E
2500|$|Though {{frequently}} underappreciated, unilateral neglect {{can have}} dramatic consequences. [...] It has more {{negative effect on}} functional ability, {{as measured by the}} Barthel ADL index, than age, sex, power, side of stroke, balance, proprioception, cognition, or premorbid ADL status. Its presence within the first 10 days of a stroke is a stronger predictor of poor functional recovery after one year than several other variables, including <b>hemiparesis,</b> hemianopsia, age, visual memory, verbal memory, or visuoconstructional ability. [...] Neglect is likely among the reasons that patients with right hemisphere damage {{are twice as likely to}} fall as those with left brain damage. Patients with neglect rehabilitate longer and make less daily progress than other patients with similar functional status. [...] And patients with neglect are less likely to live independently than even patients who have both severe aphasia and right <b>hemiparesis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Individuals {{with global}} aphasia have severe {{communication}} difficulties {{and will be}} extremely limited {{in their ability to}} speak or comprehend language. [...] They may be totally nonverbal, and/or use only facial expressions and gestures to communicate. It is associated with right <b>hemiparesis,</b> meaning that there can be paralysis of the patient's right face and arm.|$|E
2500|$|Severe rigors may {{mark the}} onset of this disease in humans. Fever, {{headache}} and malaise are other non-specific symptoms of this disease which may last {{for a period of}} between 1 and 6 days. Signs which develop during the acute encephalitic stage include neck rigidity, cachexia, <b>hemiparesis,</b> convulsions and a raised body temperature between [...] Mental retardation is usually developed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{disease is}} characterised by {{bilateral}} diffuse uveitis, with pain, redness and blurring of vision. The eye symptoms may {{be accompanied by}} a varying constellation of systemic symptoms, such as auditory (tinnitus, vertigo, and hypoacusis), neurological (meningismus, with malaise, fever, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, stiffness of the neck and back, or a combination of these factors; meningitis, CSF pleocytosis, cranial nerve palsies, <b>hemiparesis,</b> transverse myelitis and ciliary ganglionitis), and cutaneous manifestations, including [...] poliosis, vitiligo, and alopecia. The vitiligo often is found at the sacral region.|$|E
50|$|People with <b>hemiparesis</b> {{often have}} {{difficulties}} maintaining their balance due to limb weaknesses {{leading to an}} inability to properly shift body weight. This makes performing everyday activities such as dressing, eating, grabbing objects, or using the bathroom more difficult. <b>Hemiparesis</b> with origin in the lower section of the brain creates a condition known as ataxia, a loss of both gross and fine motor skills, often manifesting as staggering and stumbling. Pure Motor <b>Hemiparesis,</b> a form of <b>hemiparesis</b> characterized by sided weakness in the leg, arm, and face, is the most commonly diagnosed form of <b>hemiparesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Because of this anatomy, {{injuries}} to the pyramidal tract above the medulla generally cause contralateral <b>hemiparesis</b> (weakness {{on the opposite}} side as the injury). Injuries at the lower medulla, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves result in ipsilateral <b>hemiparesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} {{finding is}} a false localizing sign, the so-called Kernohan's notch, which results from compression of the contralateral cerebral crus containing descending corticospinal and some corticobulbar tract fibers. This leads to Ipsilateral <b>hemiparesis</b> {{in reference to the}} herniation and contralateral <b>hemiparesis</b> with reference to the cerebral crus.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hemiparesis,</b> or {{unilateral}} paresis, is {{weakness of}} one entire {{side of the}} body ( [...] means [...] "half"). Hemiplegia is, in its most severe form, complete paralysis of half of the body. <b>Hemiparesis</b> and hemiplegia can be caused by different medical conditions, including congenital causes, trauma, tumors, or stroke.|$|E

The authors hypothesize that brain reorganization after the initial injury led to more reliance on uncrossed motor pathways, and when these compensatory pathways were damaged by a second stroke, motor function worsened further.|$|E
