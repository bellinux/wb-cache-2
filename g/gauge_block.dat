5000|$|An {{important}} feature of <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> {{is that they can}} be joined together with very little dimensional uncertainty. The blocks are joined by a sliding process called wringing, which causes their ultra-flat surfaces to cling together. A small number of <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> can be used to create accurate lengths within a wide range. By using 3 blocks from a set of 30 blocks, one may create any of the 1000 lengths from 3.000 to 3.999 mm in 0.001 mm steps (or [...]3000 to [...]3999 inches in 0.0001 inch steps). <b>Gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> were invented in 1896 by Swedish machinist Carl Edvard Johansson. [...] They are used as a reference for the calibration of measuring equipment used in machine shops, such as micrometers, sine bars, calipers, and dial indicators (when used in an inspection role). <b>Gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> are the main means of length standardization used by industry.|$|R

5000|$|Johansson {{invented the}} <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> set, {{also known as}} [...] "Jo Blocks" [...] ("Johansson gauge blocks"). He was granted his first Swedish patent on 2 May 1901, Swedish patent No. 17017 called [...] "Gauge Block Sets for Precision Measurement". He formed the Swedish company CE Johansson AB (CEJ AB), Eskilstuna, Sweden in 1911. The first CEJ <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> set in America was sold to Henry M. Leland at Cadillac Automobile Co. around 1908.|$|E
50|$|One way to {{consider}} {{this is that the}} real value often has the characteristics of an irrational number. In real-world measuring situations, improving the measurement technique will eventually begin yielding unpredictable least significant digits. For example, a 1-inch long <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> will measure to be exactly 1 inch long until the measuring techniques reach a certain degree of precision. As techniques improve beyond this threshold, it will become clear that 1 inch is not the real value of the <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> length, but some other number approximates it.|$|E

5000|$|The ANSI/ASME {{standard}} {{follows a}} similar philosophy {{as set forth}} in ISO 3650. See the NIST reference below for more detailed information on tolerances for each grade and block size. Also consult page 2 of: Commercial <b>Gauge</b> <b>Block</b> Tolerances (Length refers to the calibrated thickness) ...|$|E
5000|$|There is {{a formal}} test to measure wringability. First, the block is {{prepared}} for wringing using the standard process. The block is then slid across a 2 in reference grade ( [...] flatness) quartz optical flat while applying moderate pressure. Then, {{the bottom of the}} <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> is observed (through the optical flat) for oil or color. For Federal Grades 0.5, 1, and 2 and ISO grades K, 00, and 0 no oil or color should be visible under the <b>gauge</b> <b>block.</b> For Federal Grade 3 and ISO grades 1 and 2, no more than 20% of the surface area should show oil or color. Note that this test is hard to perform on gauge blocks thinner than 0.1 in because they tend not to be flat in the relaxed state.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{wringing}} pads used {{to prepare}} a <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> for wringing. The first is an oil pad, which applies a light layer of oil to the block. The second is a dry pad, which removes any excess oil from the block after the oil pad has been used.|$|E
40|$|An {{interferometer}} is realized, {{based on}} the Twyman-Green Interferometer principle for the calibration of long <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> and length bars in the 100 - 1000 mm range with an uncertainty of 0. 02 micrometers + 0, 1 micrometers /m. Also the expansion coefficient of <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> and even of rod-shaped materials with non-optical flat faces can be calibrated in the 18 - 22 degrees C range with an uncertainty below 1 X 10 - 7 /K. The set-up basically follows {{the most commonly used}} interferometer arrangements for long <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> as they are described by Darnedde, Ikonen and Lewis where the most similarities with the latter occur. The set- up has some peculiarities which make the measurement straightforward, accurate and reliable...|$|R

50|$|Angles are {{measured}} using a sine bar {{with the help}} of <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> and a dial gauge or a spirit level. The aim of a measurement is to measure the surface on which the dial gauge or spirit level is placed horizontally. For example, to measure the angle of a wedge, the wedge is placed on a horizontal table. The sine bar is placed over the inclined surface of the wedge. At this position, the top surface of the sine bar is inclined the same amount as the wedge. Using <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks,</b> the top surface is made horizontal. The sine of the angle of inclination of the wedge is the ratio of the height of the <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> used and the distance between the centers of the cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|Gauge blocks (also {{known as}} gage blocks, Johansson gauges, slip gauges, or Jo blocks) are {{a system for}} {{producing}} precision lengths. The individual <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> is a metal or ceramic block that has been precision ground and lapped to a specific thickness. Gauge blocks come in sets of blocks {{with a range of}} standard lengths. In use, the blocks are stacked to make up a desired length.|$|E
5000|$|After use {{the blocks}} are re-oiled or greased {{to protect against}} corrosion. The ability for a given <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> to wring is called it is officially defined as [...] "the ability of two {{surfaces}} to adhere tightly {{to each other in}} the absence of external means." [...] The minimum conditions for wringability are a surface finish of [...] AA or better, and a flatness of at least [...]|$|E
50|$|Not all {{calibration}} is {{an affair}} for metrology labs. A micrometer can be calibrated on-site anytime, {{at least in}} the most basic and important way (if not comprehensively), by measuring a high-grade <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> and adjusting to match. Even gauges that are calibrated annually and within their expiration timeframe should be checked this way every month or two, if they are used daily. They usually will check out OK as needing no adjustment.|$|E

5000|$|Tungsten carbide is {{a common}} {{material}} used {{in the manufacture of}} <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks,</b> used as a system for producing precision lengths in dimensional metrology.|$|R
50|$|In use, {{the blocks}} {{are removed from}} the set, cleaned of their {{protective}} coating (petroleum jelly or oil) and wrung {{together to form a}} stack of the required dimension. <b>Gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> are calibrated to be accurate at 68 F and should be kept at this temperature when taking measurements. This mitigates the effects of thermal expansion. The wear blocks, made of a harder substance like tungsten carbide, are included {{at each end of the}} stack, whenever possible, to protect the <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> from being damaged in use.|$|R
5000|$|The pictured {{accessories}} {{provide a}} set of holders and tools to extend {{the usefulness of the}} <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> set. They provide a means of securely clamping large stacks together, along with reference points, scribers, and various shapes of blocks that act like caliper jaws, either external or internal. Conical-tip ones ease measurement of center-to-center distances between hole centers. A stack of gauge blocks with external caliper-jaw accessories, all clamped together, acts as a quickly assembled custom-size go or no-go gauge.|$|E
5000|$|Johansson {{spent many}} years in America; during his life he crossed the Atlantic 22 times. The first CEJ <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> set in America was sold to Henry M. Leland at the Cadillac Automobile Company around 1908. The first {{manufacturing}} plant in America for his <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> sets was established in Poughkeepsie, Dutchess County, New York, in 1919. The economic environment of the post-World War I recession and depression of 1920-21 did not turn out so well for the company, so in 1923 {{he wrote a letter}} to Henry Ford of the Ford Motor Company, where he proposed a cooperation in order to save his company. Henry Ford became interested, and on 18 November 1923 he began working for Henry Ford in Dearborn, Michigan. Hounshell (1984), citing Althin (1948) and various archive primary sources, says, [...] "Henry Ford purchased the famous gaugemaking operation of the Swede C. E. Johansson in 1923 and soon moved it into the laboratory facility in Dearborn. Between 1923 and 1927, the Johansson division supplied 'Jo-blocks' to the Ford toolroom and any manufacturer who could afford them. It also made some of the Ford 'go' and 'no-go' gauges used in production as well as other precision production devices." ...|$|E
5000|$|In machining, {{where the}} thou is often {{treated as a}} basic unit, 0.0001 inches can be {{referred}} to as [...] "one tenth", meaning [...] "one tenth of a thou". (The metric comparison is discussed below.) Machining [...] "to within a few tenths" [...] is often considered very accurate, and at or near the extreme limit of tolerance capability in most contexts. Greater accuracy (tolerance ranges inside one tenth) apply in only a few contexts: in plug gauge and <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> manufacturing or calibration, they are typically expressed in millionths of an inch or, alternatively, in micrometres; in nanotechnology, nanometres or picometres are used.|$|E
50|$|Molecular {{attraction}} {{occurs when}} two very flat surfaces are brought into contact. This force causes <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> to adhere even without surface lubricants, {{and in a}} vacuum.|$|R
50|$|Similar to <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks,</b> {{these are}} precision-ground {{cylindrical}} bars, {{for use as}} plug gauges to measure hole diameters, or as parts of go/no go gauges or similar applications.|$|R
50|$|Interferometry {{is used in}} the {{calibration}} of slip <b>gauges</b> (called <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> in the US) and in coordinate-measuring machines. It is {{also used}} in the testing of optical components.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> is a {{block of}} metal or ceramic with two {{opposing}} faces ground precisely flat and parallel, a precise distance apart. Standard grade blocks are made of a hardened steel alloy, while calibration grade blocks are often made of tungsten carbide or chromium carbide because it is harder and wears less. [...] Gauge blocks come in sets of blocks of various lengths, along with two wear blocks, to allow {{a wide variety of}} standard lengths to be made up by stacking them. The length of each block is actually slightly shorter than the nominal length stamped on it, because the stamped length includes the length of one wring film, a film of lubricant which separates adjacent block faces in normal use. The thickness of the wring film is about [...] The gauge's nominal length is also known as the interferometric length.|$|E
5000|$|The {{accuracy}} of micrometers is checked by {{using them to}} measure gauge blocks, rods, or similar standards whose lengths are precisely and accurately known. If the <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> {{is known to be}} 0.7500" [...] ± [...]00005" [...] ("seven-fifty plus or minus fifty millionths", that is, [...] "seven hundred fifty thou plus or minus half a tenth"), then the micrometer should measure it as 0.7500". If the micrometer measures 0.7503", then it is out of calibration. Cleanliness and low (but consistent) torque are especially important when calibrating—each tenth (that is, ten-thousandth of an inch), or hundredth of a millimeter, [...] "counts"; each is important. A mere spec of dirt, or a mere bit too much squeeze, obscure the truth of whether the instrument is able to read correctly. The solution is simply —cleaning, patience, due care and attention, and repeated measurements (good repeatability assures the calibrator that his/her technique is working correctly).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> set, {{also known}} as [...] "Jo Blocks", was {{developed}} by the Swedish inventor Carl Edvard Johansson. Johansson was employed in 1888 as an armourer inspector by the state arsenal Carl Gustafs stads Gevärsfaktori (Rifle Factory of Carl Gustaf's town) in the town of Eskilstuna, Sweden. He was concerned with the expensive tools for measuring parts for the Remington rifles then in production under license at Carl Gustaf. When Sweden adopted a tailored variant of the Mauser carbine in 1894, Johansson was very excited about the chance to study Mauser's methods of measuring, in preparation for production under license at Carl Gustaf (which began several years later). However, a visit to the Mauser factory in Oberndorf am Neckar, Germany, {{turned out to be a}} disappointment. On the train home, he thought about the problem, and he came up with the idea of a set of blocks that could be combined to make up any measure.|$|E

50|$|They {{are also}} trained {{to work with}} a wide array of {{precision}} tools, such as vernier calipers, micrometers, dial indicators, levels, <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks,</b> and optical and laser alignment tooling.|$|R
50|$|Another problem {{encountered}} is {{when the}} temperature is close to or below freezing. Rain may fall on the funnel and ice or snow may collect in the <b>gauge,</b> <b>blocking</b> subsequent rain.|$|R
