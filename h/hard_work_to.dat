[...] Unlike Jackson, who required numerous hip replacements, Emery had the benefit of advancements in modern medicine, undergoing a very specialized and complex procedure that involved removing 13 centimetres from his right fibula, and then grafting it to the femur to re-introduce a proper blood supply to the area. Holmgren said that while the surgery went better than expected, he did not know exactly how long Emery's recovery would take.|$|E

Gaskarth also said [...] "one of the big things that came along with this album ... a lot of anxiety. About where were we going to go".

[...] "How I Feel", a serene, smoky ballad, featured Norwood warning her mate that his busy life was slowly pushing her away. The song was blend of the adult-oriented urban pop of her former albums, and the more ambient, bluesy work she was dabbling with. [...] "Should I Go", based upon Coldplay's song [...] "Clocks", is built on percussive beats, syncopated handclaps and a piano riff.

They would take turns to urinate in the snow then pour plaster into the cavities. These casts were attached to pedestals that {{were based on a}} hyacinth bulb. The whole thing was then cast in bronze and enamelled white. The works are a result of her physical contact with the location, preserving a direct impact of reality. Chadwick describes the flowers as a [...] "metaphysical conceit for the union of two people expressing themselves bodily". The work utilises the pleasure of taboo; elevating the medium of urine that is generally regarded as polluting and marginal in a dynamic and playful way. [...] "It may have been mischievous to piss in the snow, but it was damn <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> end up with the 12 bronzes," [...] Chadwick recalled.
