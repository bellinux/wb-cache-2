40|$|Abstract] A supersymmetric {{model with}} U(1) <b>gauge</b> {{symmetry}} {{will be discussed}} in this paper. The model has strict U(1) <b>gauge</b> symmetry and supersymmetry simultaneously. Besides, there is a massive U(1) <b>gauge</b> field contained in the model. According to the conventional notion, if a system has strict <b>gauge</b> symmetry, the mass of <b>gauge</b> field in the lagrangian must be zero [1]. With the development of the <b>gauge</b> theory, this notion has already been changed. In the <b>gauge</b> theory developed by Wu [2], under the precondition that the system has strict <b>gauge</b> symmetry, the theory contains massive <b>gauge</b> bosons. In fact, this result holds not only in the usual quantum field theory, but also in the supersymmetric quantum field theory. In other words, we could construct a supersymmetric <b>gauge</b> field model with massive <b>gauge</b> bosons. Supersymmetric <b>gauge</b> field models have been extensively discussed in the literature [3 - 5]. Similar to the conventional <b>gauge</b> model, in all these supersymmetric <b>gauge</b> models, the masses of <b>gauge</b> fields is zero. In this paper, we will construct a <b>gauge</b> field model which has strict U(1) <b>gauge</b> symmetry, supersymmetry and one massive <b>gauge</b> field...|$|R

The book also discusses problems using large snow <b>gauges</b> made from bamboo situated in mountain passes and uplands which are speculated to be first referenced to snow measurement.

The rain <b>gauges</b> were conical or barrel-shaped with one being installed at each provincial and district capital in China. In the treatise, Qin Jiushao also discusses how point measurements were converted to real averages.
