Dividing wall column {{is one of the}} most promising technologies to minimize the energy consumption that leads to minimize the operating cost.

The health effect includes acute and chronic poisoning, and carcinogenic effect. In order to minimize the health effect, it should be efforted to reduce Cd heavy metal content in shellfish by soaking in weak acid solution as chelating agent such as <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> solution. Therefore {{the aim of this}} study was to measure effectivity of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> solution in reducing Cd heavy metal content in certain shellfish namely Kerang Bulu or Anadara indica. This study was an experimental study in laboratory, which was designed as pre-test and post-test with control group design. Twenty samples of Kerang Bulu from Kenjeran beach of Surabaya were included in this study. Each ten sample was divided into three parts and measured Cd heavy metal content before and after treatment by soaking in <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> solution 25 % and 12, 5 % for 1 and 2 hours. Average {{concentration of}} Cd heavy metal content in Kerang Bulu was 2, 47 ± 0, 79 ppm. It was extreemely higher compared to the threshold limit value recommeded by ILO/WHO i. e. 0. 1 ppm. Soaking in <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> solution 25 % for 1 and 2 hours significantly reduced (paired samples t test, p < 0, 01) Cd heavy metal content in Kerang Bulu 1, 71 ppm (63, 20 %) and 1, 96 ppm (77, 72 %) respectively. While soaking in <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> solution 12. 5 % for 1 and 2 hours significantly reduced (paired samples t test, p < 0, 01) Cd heavy metal content in Kerang Bulu 1, 35 ppm (51, 44 %) and 1, 71 ppm (65, 93 %) respectively. It is concluded that Kerang Bulu taken from Kenjeran beach of Surabaya have already polluted by high Cd <b>heavy</b> metal concentration. <b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> solution with 25 % and 12, 5 % concentration are considered as an effective chelating agent to reduce Cd heavy metal concentration in shellfish of Kerang Bulu.

In previous studies in CWBI, Acetobacter senegalensis was used for production of dried vinegar starters; however the impact of stressors (ethanol and <b>acetic</b> <b>acid)</b> on A. senegalensis remained unclear. In this study, different techniques such as flow cytometry, culturability on solid medium and 2 -DiGE were used comparatively to investigate the effect of carbon sources of inoculum media on the tolerance of A. senegalensis to stressors. Analysis of respiration system by flow cytometric methods showed {{that the presence of}} 2 % (v/v) <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> in inoculum medium, in one hand, causes 80 % of cells to continue to do respiration after a sudden exposure to 1 - 3 % (v/v) <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> in stress media while 89. 7 % of cells grown in glucose appeared as dead cells after an abrupt exposure to 3 %(v/v) of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> On the other hand, 59. 2 % and 49. 33 % of cells grown in the presence of 2 % (v/v) of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> could maintain their entire membrane integrity after exposure to 1 % and 3 % (v/v) of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> respectively. Inoculum medium contained 5 % (v/v) of ethanol as a carbon source enabled about 90 % of cells to keep their growing capacities after a sudden exposure to 3 % <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> In contrast, just 40 % of cells grown in glucose as a carbon source maintained their culturability on solid medium after exposure to 1 % <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> A similar profile of culturability was observed for the cells grown in 5 % (v/v) ethanol or 2 % (v/v) of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> A proteomic approach (2 -DiGE) was used to analyze proteins expressed in the presence of different carbon sources. Differentially expressed proteins were mainly associated with energy metabolism, carbohydrate metabolisms, folding, sorting and degradation processes. The relative abundance of proteins was extensively different for cell grown in glucose compared with protein contents of cells grown in ethanol or <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> In conclusion, production of a cost effective vinegar starter needs a qualified biomass which tolerates ethanol and <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> Tolerance of A. senegalensis to <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> depends to a great extent on the composition of the medium which cells grow in.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of ultrasound (US) -guided percutaneous <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (in concentrations of 15 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, and 50 %) injection for small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) for long-term prognosis, percutaneous <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> injection using 15 % to 50 % <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> was performed in 91 patients with one to four HCCs smaller than 3 cm during the past 6. 5 years. During the series of treatment sessions for each patient, the same concentration of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> was used. All tumors could be treated successfully with percutaneous <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> injection despite the differences in <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration used. The number of treatment sessions to treat similar size of tumor was less when the higher concentration of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> was used. No serious complications occurred as a direct sequela to percutaneous <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> injection. None of the tumor treated regrew. The 1 -, 2 -, 3 -, 4 -, and 5 -year survival rates for 91 patients were 95 %, 87 %, 80 %, 63 %, and 49 %, respectively. The 1 -, 2 -, 3 -, 4 -, and 5 -year cancer-free survival rates of these patients were 83 %, 54 %, 50 %, 37 %, and 29 %, respectively. Both liver function and size of tumor affected both survival rate and cancer-free survival rate significantly, {{but the number of}} tumors did not. The concentration of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> did not affect the survival rate. Percutaneous <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> using 15 % to 50 % <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> will be effective therapy for small HCCs for long-term prognosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{behavior of}} mild steel {{in the presence}} of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (CH 3 COOH) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) has been investi-gated using electrochemical techniques and weight-loss mea-surements. Electrochemical measurements have shown that the presence of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> affects predominantly the cathodic reaction. The <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> effect is much more pronounced at elevated temperatures when catastrophic corrosion rates may be encountered at high concentrations. The undissociated form of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> present at lower pH, is responsible for the increases seen in the corrosion rate.
