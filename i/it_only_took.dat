5|$|Calthrop {{appeared}} at the Light Railway Inquiry for the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway on 3–4 August 1897 and spoke particularly on the proposed open level crossings {{and the use of}} transporter wagons. Calthrop claimed <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>took</b> 3 minutes to transfer wagons, based on his experience on the Barsi Light Railway. However the Order was not made until 8 September 1899 and in early 1900 the proprietors reached agreement with the Cambrian Railways to build the line. Their engineer, Alfred J. Collins, took charge of the engineering requirements, with consequent conservative 4-wheel wagons and other provisions.|$|E

Although <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>took</b> 13 days to film, fellow cast member Howard Kaylan remembers Moon {{spending}} off-camera time at the Kensington Garden Hotel bar instead of sleeping. Moon's next film role was J.D. Clover, drummer for the fictional Stray Cats at a holiday camp during {{the early days of}} British rock 'n' roll, in 1973's That'll Be the Day. He reprised the role for the film's 1974 sequel, Stardust, and played Uncle Ernie in Ken Russell's 1975 film adaptation of Tommy. Moon's last film appearance was in 1978's Sextette with Starr and Alice Cooper. This was the last film to star Mae West.|$|E
5|$|From May No.80 Wing units {{participated in}} the Australian-led Borneo Campaign. No.457 Squadron was {{attached}} to No.81 Wing and deployed to Labuan on 18June {{as part of the}} Operation Oboe Six landings in the Brunei Bay region. The squadron provided air defence and flew close air support sorties alongside No.76 Squadron, and shot down a Japanese aircraft on 20June. In April No.452 Squadron was attached to No.78 Wing and took part in the landing at Tarakan in May. Delays in repairing Tarakan's airfield meant that it did not see any combat until 30June, however. The squadron subsequently supported the landing at Balikpapan in July, and one of its Spitfires shot down a Japanese aircraft {{in the early hours of}} 24July. During this period No.79 Squadron remained at Morotai and continued to fly ground attack sorties against Japanese positions on the nearby island of Halmahera. On 30July 1945 No. 80 Wing Headquarters was absorbed into the newly formed No.11 Group. While it was intended that the wing's three flying squadrons would come under the command of this group, in the event <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>took</b> operational control of No.79 Squadron before the war ended.|$|E

After an accident caused by Lilith, Rosie is hospitalized and Mark and Callie {{take on the task}} to raise Lilith. In just a few weeks, she is eighteen years old and has started dating Randall. Mark takes in Twayne for a session and finds out about his arranged marriage to Lilith, and that the marriage will be a televised sex ritual. Callie realizes that she is forcing Lilith to marry Twayne, just like her father forced her, and tells Lilith that she does not want her to marry him. Lilith, however, wants to the opposite of what Callie wants and tells her that she will marry him. Just before the ritual is about to commence, Lilith reveals to Mark that she plots to kill Callie and Twayne and instead join Mark at the sex altar. Mark informs Callie, who takes out her soul to transform into a more demonic figure. Following a battle between the two, Lilith falls down to a lower level of Hell. Later, Callie kicks Mark out of her apartment as she does not have to marry Twayne anymore.|$|E

25|$|During World War I, several {{ingredients}} of postage stamp ink {{that had previously}} been imported from Germany became unavailable, and the domestic materials that replaced them had significant gritty impurities, with the result that the stamp printing plates became worn much more quickly. In response to this problem, the U.S. Post Office employed the new offset printing process to produce several separate Washington-head issues. The offset method involved taking a photo of a die proof of the postage stamp and through a special process, transferring an image of its negative to a plate of glass, which became the actual printing plate. The set-up and development process was more involved in the preparation stages than the engraving process, but once the photo mask was made <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>took</b> about an hour to produce and replace a worn printing plate. The offset process produced an image of lesser quality with a smooth surface, as compared to that of an engraved stamp whose lines are raised above the surface of the paper. A stamp produced by the offset process almost always possesses a softer or grayish tone to its color and is usually easy to distinguish, especially when placed next to a similar stamp printed by the engraving process.|$|E

Six plays later, Joel Stave connected with fullback Derek Straus on a 3-yard touchdown pass. It was Straus' first career start and his first career touchdown. After two Tech punts and a Wisconsin punt, the Badgers took over at their own 24-yard line just under seven {{minutes left in the}} first quarter. After a Melvin Gordon 5-yard run, Gordon ripped off a 65-yard run and was pushed out-of-bounds at the Golden Eagles 6-yard line. The very next play, Joel Stave hit Jared Abbrederis with a 6-yard touchdown pass giving the Badgers a 14–0 lead. The first quarter end after a Tech punt and the Badgers driving into Tech territory. At the start of the second quarter, the Badgers got down to the Golden Eagles 37-yard line but Joel Stave threw an interception that was returned to Tech's 39-yard line. After a Tech punt, a Wisconsin punt and another Tech punt, the Badgers took over at their own 48-yard line. <b>It</b> <b>only</b> <b>took</b> Wisconsin three plays to drive 52 yards and score on a 37-yard touchdown run by Melvin Gordon stretching the lead to 21. After a Tech punt and Wisconsin penalty on the punt return, the Badgers were backed up at their own 6-yard line with 1:49 left until halftime. The Badgers put together an impressive 11-play 94-yard scoring drive that only took one minute and 37 seconds. Joel Stave was 10–10 passing during the drive and capped the drive with a 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Brian Wozniak. The Golden Eagles then took the kickoff to their own 19-yard line and took a knee on the final play of the half with the Badgers leading 28–0.|$|E
25|$|Oklahoma {{began the}} game with the ball and {{capitalized}} quickly. On the opening kickoff, Juaquin Iglesias returned the ball 47yards to the 50yard line. The Sooners relied on the running game throughout the entire game. The Sooners worked their way towards the endzone with nine plays, seven rushing and two passing, to take the early lead. Oklahoma State went three-and-out on their first possession and Oklahoma began their next possession on their own 42yard line. This time, <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>took</b> Oklahoma six plays, all rushing, {{to get back in}} the endzone. This included a 41yard run by Allen Patrick. Oklahoma State had more success on their next possession. Beginning on their own 13yard line, the Cowboys drove the 87yards on 13plays to get sevenpoints of their own on the board. Oklahoma answered with another touchdown on their next possession which included a 32yard run for Patrick. The Sooner defense was tested on the next possession. Again, the Cowboys started deep in their own territory. They drove nearly 60yards to Oklahoma's 13yard line. On the next play, the Cowboys got the first down when Dantrell Savage ran for 12yards before being tackled at Oklahoma's one-yard line. Oklahoma State tried threerushing plays up the middle but were stuffed by Oklahoma's defense. On the fourth attempt, rather than kick a field goal, the Cowboy offense tried one last time to get in the endzone. Rather than run straight up the middle as they had tried the previous three times, quarterback Zac Robinson rushed to the right but was tackled by Curtis Lofton. The ball popped loose and Oklahoma's D.J. Wolfe recovered it and was tackled at the Oklahoma 13yard line. Oklahoma followed with another touchdown that saw Bradford's two longest pass of the first half – a 24-yard throw to Jermaine Gresham and another of the same distance to Iglesias. Bradford completed a twoyard touchdown pass to Joe Jon Finley, his 30th touchdown pass of the season. That pass broke the NCAA record for most touchdown passes for a freshman quarterback. The previous record was set in 1998 by Nevada's David Neill and tied in 2006 by Texas's Colt McCoy. Oklahoma State managed to score a field goal in the closing seconds of the first half. Oklahoma had scored a touchdown on every possession in the first half to give them a 28–10 lead going into halftime.|$|E
