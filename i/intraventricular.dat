5|$|Hematomas, also focal lesions, are {{collections}} {{of blood in}} or around the brain that can result from hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage, with bleeding in the brain tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and <b>intraventricular</b> hemorrhage. Epidural hematoma involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the dura mater, the outermost of the three membranes surrounding the brain. In subdural hematoma, bleeding occurs between the dura and the arachnoid mater. Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding into {{the space between the}} arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. <b>Intraventricular</b> hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in the ventricles.|$|E
5|$|This {{scale has}} been {{modified}} by Claassen and coworkers, reflecting the additive risk from SAH size and accompanying <b>intraventricular</b> hemorrhage (0 - none; 1 - minimal SAH w/o IVH; 2 - minimal SAH with IVH; 3 - thick SAH w/o IVH; 4 - thick SAH with IVH);.|$|E
5|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a common}} condition (prevalence >1:500) characterized by abnormal thickening of the ventricular muscle, classically in the <b>intraventricular</b> septal wall. HCM {{is described as a}} disease of the sarcomere, because mutations in the contractile proteins of the sarcomere have been identified in about half of patients with HCM. The cTnC mutations that have been associated with HCM are A8V, L29Q, A31S, C84Y, D145E. In all cases, the mutation was identified in a single patient, so additional genetic testing is needed to confirm or refute the clinical significance of these mutations. With most of these mutations (and with HCM-associated thin filament mutations in general), an increase in cardiac calcium sensitivity has been observed.|$|E
5|$|SAH {{is often}} {{associated}} with a poor outcome. The death rate (mortality) for SAH is between 40 and 50 percent, but trends for survival are improving. Of those that survive hospitalization, more than a quarter have significant restrictions in their lifestyle, and less than a fifth have no residual symptoms whatsoever. Delay in diagnosis of minor SAH (mistaking the sudden headache for migraine) contributes to poor outcome. Factors found on admission that are associated with poorer outcome include poorer neurological grade; systolic hypertension; a previous diagnosis of heart attack or SAH; liver disease; more blood and larger aneurysm on the initial CT scan; location of an aneurysm in the posterior circulation; and higher age. Factors that carry a worse prognosis during the hospital stay include occurrence of delayed ischemia resulting from vasospasm, development of intracerebral hematoma, or <b>intraventricular</b> hemorrhage (bleeding into the ventricles of the brain) and presence of fever on the eighthday of admission.|$|E
25|$|Cerebral {{hemorrhage}} (also {{known as}} intracerebral hemorrhage), {{which is basically}} bleeding within the brain itself (when an artery in the brain bursts, flooding the surrounding tissue with blood), due to either intraparenchymal hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain tissue) or <b>intraventricular</b> hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain's ventricular system).|$|E
25|$|QRS {{complexes}} {{should be}} narrow, signifying {{that they are}} initiated by normal conduction of atrial electrical activity through the <b>intraventricular</b> conduction system. Wide QRS complexes are worrisome for ventricular tachycardia, although, in cases {{where there is a}} disease of the conduction system, wide complexes may be present in A-Fib with rapid ventricular response.|$|E
25|$|Glucostatic hypothesis: The {{activity}} of the satiety center in the ventromedial nuclei is probably governed by the glucose utilization in the neurons. It has been postulated that when their glucose utilization is low and consequently when the arteriovenous blood glucose difference across them is low, the activity across the neurons decrease. Under these conditions, the {{activity of}} the feeding center is unchecked and the individual feels hungry. Food intake is rapidly increased by <b>intraventricular</b> administration of 2-deoxyglucose therefore decreasing glucose utilization in cells.|$|E

Amphotericin B {{used to be the}} only available treatment, although now there are alternatives, including itraconazole or ketoconazole may be used for milder disease. Fluconazole is the preferred medication for coccidioidal meningitis, due to its penetration into CSF. Intrathecal or <b>intraventricular</b> amphotericin B therapy is used if infection persists after fluconazole treatment. Itraconazole is used for cases that involve treatment of infected person's bones and joints. The antifungal medications posaconazole and voriconazole have also been used to treat coccidioidomycosis.

2500|$|In 2012, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists officially {{endorsed}} delaying clamping of {{the umbilical}} cord for 30–60 seconds with the newborn held {{below the level of}} the placenta in all cases of preterm delivery based largely on evidence that it reduces the risk of <b>intraventricular</b> hemorrhage in these children by 50%. In the same committee statement, ACOG also recognize several other likely benefits for preterm infants, including [...] "improved transitional circulation, better establishment of red blood cell volume, and decreased need for blood transfusion". In January 2017, a revised Committee Opinion extended the recommendation to term infants, citing data that term infants benefit from increased hemoglobin levels in the newborn period and improved iron stores in the first months of life, which may result in improved developmental outcomes. ACOG recognized a small increase in the incidence of jaundice in term infants with delayed cord clamping, and recommended policies be in place to monitor for [...] and treat neonatal jaundice. ACOG also noted that delayed cord clamping is not associated with increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage.|$|E
