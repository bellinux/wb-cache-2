5|$|Texas modernized and {{expanded}} its system {{of higher education}} through the 1960s. The state created a comprehensive plan <b>for</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education,</b> funded {{in large part by}} oil revenues, and a central state apparatus designed to manage state institutions more efficiently. These changes helped Texas universities receive federal research funds.|$|E
5|$|The state legislature, {{with the}} governor's support, cut {{spending}} by $1.6billion, including $700million in reductions in state aid to cities and towns. The cuts {{also included a}} $140million reduction in state funding <b>for</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education,</b> which led state-run colleges and universities to increase fees by 63percent over four years. Romney sought additional cuts in his last year as governor by vetoing nearly 250items in the state budget; a heavily Democratic legislature overrode all the vetoes.|$|E

5|$|The two Texas schools quickly {{began to}} {{battle over the}} limited funds that the state {{legislature}} made available <b>for</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education.</b> In 1887, the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station was established at Texas A.M.C., enabling the college to gain more funding. Many residents of the state saw little need for two colleges in Texas, and some wanted to close the agricultural and mechanical school.|$|E

5|$|Higher {{education}} students normally attend university from age 18 onwards, where they study for an academic degree. There are over 90universities in England, {{all but one}} of which are public institutions. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is the government department responsible <b>for</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> in England. Students are generally entitled to student loans {{to cover the cost of}} tuition fees and living costs. The first degree offered to undergraduates is the Bachelor's degree, which usually takes three years to complete. Students are then able to work towards a postgraduate degree, which usually takes one year, or towards a doctorate, which takes three or more years.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, Philipp {{attended}} the 4. Volksschule (Pestalozzischule—4th elementary school) in Meissen. Philipp {{was a very}} good student. His mother understood that education was essential to Philipp's future. She worked very hard to raise the funds to pay <b>for</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> in order to send Philipp to a Gymnasium (secondary school). In 1927, she managed to have Philipp admitted to the Franziskaneum in Meissen, the Realgymnasium—a secondary school built on the mid-level Realschule to achieve the Abitur (university entry qualification)—in Meissen. Alma, desperate to secure her son's schooling, wrote to the city council of Meissen in 1932 asking if the school fees could be waived.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the Florida Legislature {{recognized}} demands <b>for</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> in South Florida by designating Florida Atlantic as {{the lead}} state university serving Broward County. To fill this role, the university would establish a campus in Dania Beach in 1997 and another campus in the City of Davie in western Broward County in 1990. Florida Atlantic later purchased 50 acres (20 ha) of land in Port St. Lucie in 1994 to establish a campus on the Treasure Coast. This would be the institution's fifth campus. The university continued its expansion in 1999 when it opened its Jupiter Campus, named for the late John D. MacArthur. This campus houses the university's honors college.|$|E
5|$|On January 26, 2016, Bevin {{delivered}} a budget {{address to the}} General Assembly detailing his two-year budget proposal. The proposal cut the allocation for most state agencies by 9 percent over the upcoming biennium, {{with most of the}} savings being redirected into the state pension system, which was among the worst funded in the nation. Public elementary and secondary education were spared from the cuts, as were social workers, public defenders, corrections officers, and Kentucky State Police employees, all of whom received raises under Bevin's proposal. Public colleges and universities were not exempt from the cuts, and Bevin called for a gradual move to performance-based funding <b>for</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education,</b> with all higher education funding tied to performance by 2020.|$|E

The University of Dayton is Ohio's largest private university and {{is also home to}} the University of Dayton Research Institute, which ranks third in the nation for sponsored materials research, and the Center for Tissue Regeneration and Engineering at Dayton, which focuses on human tissue regeneration.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{followed}} up her {{success in the}} 1985 special session with a push for more higher education funding in the 1986 legislative session. Lawmakers obliged by approving an additional $100million <b>for</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> in the biennial budget. They also approved implementation of a pilot preschool program and the purchase of new reading textbooks, but failed to act on Collins' request for an additional $3.9million to improve the state's vocational education system. Legislators approved calling a referendum on a constitutional amendment– supported by Collins– to make the state superintendent of education an appointive, rather than elective, office. The amendment was defeated by the state's voters in November 1986, despite a Collins-led campaign in favor of it. The increased corporate tax intended {{to cover the cost}} of the increased education budget was, however, inadequate. In 1987, a plan to increase revenue through changes in the state income tax was abandoned when Wallace Wilkinson, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee who would go on to succeed Collins, announced his opposition to it.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Joachim Pius Noronha, a Mangalorean Catholic priest, and John Joseph Saldanha, a Mangalorean Catholic judge, the Mangalorean Catholics sent a petition to the Holy See in 1840 to establish Mangalore as a separate Vicariate. Conceding to their request, Pope Gregory XVI established Mangalore as a separate Vicariate on 17 February 1845 under the Verapoly Carmelites. The Mangalore Mission {{was transferred to the}} French Carmelites by a bull dated 3 January 1870. During the regime of Carmelites, the Mangalorean Catholics constantly sent memorandums to the Holy See to send Jesuits to Mangalore to start institutions <b>for</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education,</b> since students frequently had to go to Bombay and Madras for educational purposes. Pope Leo XIII, by the Brief of 27 September 1878, handed over the Mangalore mission to the Italian Jesuit of Naples, who reached Mangalore on 31 December 1878.|$|E
5|$|During World War II most of {{the student}} body was called to active {{military}} duty, enrollment declined and the campus closed in 1943. Reopening after the war, Cal Poly-Voorhis Unit operated in San Dimas until 1956 when it moved to Will Keith Kellogg’s former horse ranch in the neighboring city of Pomona, California. Acknowledging its Kellogg legacy, Cal Poly-Voorhis Unit changed its name to Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis Unit and offered six programs in agriculture. The inaugural class of 1957 at the new campus consisted of 57 students graduating with bachelor’s degrees in a ceremony held at the Rose Garden in Pomona and religious services at Voorhis Chapel in San Dimas. Also in 1957, Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis introduced the College of Engineering, the second academic unit after the College of Agriculture. The California Master Plan <b>for</b> <b>Higher</b> <b>Education</b> added the two Cal Poly campuses to the new California State College system in 1961 and Cal Poly Kellogg-Voorhis Unit opened its doors {{for the first time to}} 329 female students. President McPhee retired in 1966, and Cal Poly split into two different and independent universities. The partnership between the two campuses remains with their involvement in the annual Cal Poly Universities Rose Float.|$|E
5|$|The first {{institute}} <b>for</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> in {{the village}} was the School of Practical Agriculture and Horticulture, which Walter Law helped establish on his Briarcliff Farms in 1900. The school taught students ages 16 to 35 in crop and livestock care. In 1902, the school moved to a larger location near Poughkeepsie and closed a year later {{due to a lack}} of funding. In addition, Briarcliff Manor has been the location for several colleges. Briarcliff Junior College was founded in 1903 at the Briarcliff Lodge, and moved near Briarcliff Congregational Church, on land Walter Law donated, in 1905. Among its trustees were Howard Deering Johnson, Norman Cousins, Carl Carmer, Thomas K. Finletter, William Zorach, Eduard C. Lindeman, and Lyman Bryson. Ordway Tead was chairman of the board of trustees, and his wife Clara was the college's first president. The school gradually improved its academic scope and standing, and was registered with the State Education Department and accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 1944. In 1951, the Board of Regents authorized the college to grant Associate of Arts and Associate of Applied Science degrees. The following year, the Army Map Service selected the college as the only one in the country for professional training in cartography. In 1956, the junior college started issuing bachelor's degrees, and became known as Briarcliff College. In 1977 Pace University bought Briarcliff College and the Spanish Renaissance-style Briarcliff Grade School building, incorporating them into its Pleasantville campus. The Briarcliff Grade School building, which housed the village public school from 1909 to 1980, became known as the Pace University Village Center. During Pace's occupation, the building housed the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society and the Village Youth Center. Pace University operated the school building until its demolition in 1996, and the Briarcliff College campus until 2015. At the Briarcliff Lodge property, the Edgewood Park School operated from 1936 to 1954, and King's College subsequently operated there from 1955 to 1994, also using the lodge building and other dormitories and academic buildings.|$|E
