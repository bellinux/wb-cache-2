It was quite frightening - they had machine guns on the roof. I was also allowed to drive around the perimeter but if you {{got out of the}} car there was a loudspeaker warning you to keep away. There was not a chance of going in it, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> because I knew from going to the Bank of England vaults that gold isn't stacked very high and it's all underwhelming. It gave me the chance to show the biggest gold repository in the world as I imagined it, with gold going up to heaven. I came up with this cathedral-type design. I had a big job to persuade Cubby and the director Guy Hamilton at first." ...|$|E
500|$|City's matchwinner Hamilton and {{his manager}} Kamara shared the {{headlines}} in the national newspapers. Hamilton said after the game: [...] "To score for my hometown team at Wembley {{has got to be}} one of the best feelings ever." [...] Kamara added: [...] "Now I am hungry for second helpings of success. And I am absolutely convinced I can get it here. We will not look out of place in the First Division because we have so much quality." [...] County's manager Colin Murphy told the press: [...] "All credit to Bradford, they won it fair and square. And that does not always happen in football. Bradford are a very experienced side compared to mine. Maybe this came a year too early for my boys." [...] Jacobs, the Bradford full-back who played 11 years for the club and won a subsequent promotion to the Premier League, said after his career: [...] "I just look back on some amazing times and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> to be part of them. It was a real blessing to my life. To play at Wembley was a dream fulfilled." ...|$|E
500|$|Mexican actor Ricardo Montalbán {{was cast}} as the genetic superman Khan Noonian Singh, having been the first choice for the role. He had been {{suggested}} by casting director Joseph D'Agosta, who was not looking to cast an actor of a particular ethnic background due to Roddenberry's vision for the series; Roddenberry wanted to show his perceived 23rd century values by not requiring any specific ethnicities when casting actors in guest roles. Montalbán had previously appeared in a television movie created by Roddenberry, The Secret Weapon of 117 (also referred to as The Secret Defense of 117), which was the writer's first attempt to create science fiction on television and aired {{more than ten years}} before Star Trek. Montalbán called his role as Khan [...] "wonderful", saying that [...] "it was well-written, it had an interesting concept and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> it was offered to me". The main cast were enthusiastic about working with Montalbán; DeForest Kelley later said [...] "I enjoyed working with Ricardo the best. I was privileged. He is a marvelous actor." ...|$|E

500|$|Byrom is a midfielder, {{and is more}} {{comfortable}} in the centre of midfield. He is left-footed, although the left side is not his natural position, and he is rarely deployed as a winger. In 2007, Clitheroe chairman, Carl Garner, said that Byrom has [...] "tremendous skill and potential", adding [...] "Joel is a quality player. He can do things with the ball that players on the television can't. In May 2009, Stevenage manager Graham Westley believed that the acquisition of Byrom would [...] "give the squad more balance", and has also described him as having a [...] "cultured left-foot" [...] that enables him to open up opposition defences. On securing the signature of Byrom, Westley said, [...] "Joel is very creative going forward {{and is going to}} be one hell of a player. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> to secure his signature as he is a real talent". Dino Maamria has called Byrom a [...] "creative midfielder", as well as being able to unlock defences. Byrom has called himself [...] "a good passer of the ball", as well as being able to [...] "chip in with a few goals and generally get the team ticking over". In March 2010, following Stevenage's 3–0 win against Crawley Town, a game in which Byrom scored a goal from just inside Crawley's half, Westley said that Byrom has the [...] "ability to score spectacular goals".|$|E
2500|$|Kirby {{moved on}} to comic-book {{publisher}} and newspaper syndicator Fox Feature Syndicate, earning a then-reasonable $15-a-week salary. He began to explore superhero narrative with the comic strip The Blue Beetle, published [...] from January to March 1940, starring a character created by the pseudonymous Charles Nicholas, a house name that Kirby retained for the three-month-long strip. During this time, Kirby met and began collaborating with cartoonist and Fox editor Joe Simon, who {{in addition to his}} staff work continued to freelance. Simon recalled in 1988, [...] "I loved Jack's work and the first time I saw it I couldn't believe what I was seeing. He asked if we could do some freelance work together. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> and I took him over to my little office. We worked from the second issue of Blue Bolt through... about 25 years." ...|$|E

[...] He asked me what it was, and I told him it was the white man’s religion which was discussed in that room. [...] He came in and sat with us boys. [...] During the preaching he sat very reverently and listened attentively to all that was said, although he could not understand a single word. [...] His attention to the service pleased Captain Pratt exceedingly. [...] When my father was ready to depart, he was presented with a well-made top-buggy and a set of harness, all of which were made at the school. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> at seeing my father so well treated and recognized. [...] Other chiefs had visited us, but my father was the first Indian to receive such courteous recognition and agreeable presents.|$|E

She called me one day and asked if she could bring her sister along with her onto location. I said, 'Sure, of course, no problem.' And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> because she was going out {{with the head of the}} studio. She could have been the biggest pain in the ass alive. And I would be in a terribly awkward position if she started with the limousines and the special means and whatever the hell it is—or complaining about whatever. But never a peep out of her. Most pleasant, most charming, very cooperative, very hard-working. She was always there half an hour before her call and she always stayed on for a half hour just in case. Interested in everything that went on, and was a total joy. I couldn't ask for a more cooperative actor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Batty made 32 {{appearances}} {{during the}} 1996–97 season, an eventful campaign {{in which he}} missed six weeks with a fractured hand, won his third FA Trophy and helped the Cards take Premiership side Coventry City to a replay {{in the third round}} of the FA Cup. After his third FA Trophy win, he said [...] "the first one is the most special but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> to keep a clean sheet {{for the first time at}} Wembley". Batty also netted another goal during the season. As a recognition of Batty's continued service, he was awarded a testimonial versus former club Fulham in August 1999. Batty continued to play on until the end of the 1999–00 season, having seen his appearance-count diminish over the previous two seasons with the emergence of young understudy Darryl Flahavan. In the summer of 2000, Batty stalled over signing a new one-year contract and was then released by manager Colin Lippiatt in a summer clearout. Batty made 422 appearances and scored five goals during his nine years with Woking.|$|E
2500|$|Lucy Benjamin {{told the}} Daily Star that keeping the secret that her {{character}} {{was responsible for}} the attempted murder had been the [...] "worst two months of her life". She commented to The Mirror, [...] "For two months I've carried this secret and it's been tough, really hard. I've had to lie to my colleagues— all the suspects were told to say it wasn't us. I've become very good at lying! The lies went on and on. The first person I told that it wasn't me was Todd Carty, who plays Mark [...] I thought he was a good chap to try my lies on to see if he believed it! And he did. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> that it was me. I think Lisa had every reason to do it". At the time, Lucy Benjamin expressed fear that the high-profile storyline would spell the end of her character, who she had thought would be imprisoned. However, in a further plot twist, Phil framed Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), for the shooting. Subsequent storylines involved in Lisa and Phil's narratives surrounded Lisa's pregnancy. In the storyline, Lisa, secretly expecting Phil's baby, married Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), and claimed the baby was his. This secret was blown in the Christmas Day 2001 episodes.|$|E

2500|$|Like many genre authors, Carl perfected her craft at {{the short}} fiction level.... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> to find Carl's most {{important}} stories collected {{here for the}} first time.... Of the 11 stories contained here, all have some sort of underlying mythic/historical theme, which is Carl's forté.... Perhaps the most ambitious story here is [...] "From the Labyrinth of Night." [...] A Martian exploration setup is developed nicely with rich allusions to the Minotaur legends of ancient Crete, culminating in the [...] "sacrifice" [...] demanded by the beast in the maze. The interpersonal relationships are the real driving force to the narrative, as by this point, the astronauts' explorations are mechanical efforts done out of habit more than enthusiasm.... "Upon this Shoal of Time" [...] is another ambitious science fiction story cloaked in the trappings of mythology. This time, Carl takes the reader to a far-future archaeological dig, where real science is dependent upon the financial sponsorship of media conglomerates hopeful of unearthing exclusive rights to digs that capture the public fancy, King Tut-style. After unearthing an intact Pictish skull from a Scottish burial site in Cawdor, Dr. James Henderson subjects it to a series of elaborate processes, each one designed to unlock lost memories from the subject at the sub-atomic level. His experiment is far more successful than he'd ever dreamed. At turns disturbing and impressive, with MacBethian overtones, Carl crafts a moving tale around the strength and impact memories can have on a person. One of the strongest stories presented here — the fuzzy science of the premise is presented smoothly and logically, detracting nothing from the narrative.|$|E
