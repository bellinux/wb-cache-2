25|$|Following various {{media reports}} in 2012 that Cyprus was {{entertaining}} offers by Israel and Greece to supply two heavy Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs), being far {{larger and more}} capable than anything previously operated, it was extensively reported in January 2013 that Cyprus has {{signed an agreement with}} France to purchase two large, stealthy and well-armed vessels based upon the GOWIND corvette design. This frenzy of media speculation was bolstered by the otherwise sudden and unexplained visit to Cyprus by the L'Adroit, which some sources interpreted as a demonstration of the ship design, to be held at Limassol port from 24 to 26 January 2013. Further unconfirmed reports by the Cyprus media claim to have it on good authority that a $120 million USD down payment for the vessels is factored into the 2013 fiscal budget, <b>justified</b> <b>against</b> the financial crisis by emergency defense requirements.|$|E
500|$|The book {{begins with}} a {{discussion}} of targeted killing of non-combatants, followed by discussions of legalities, the rationale of self-defence, the choice of targets, and when and whether the ends can be used to justify the means. Several contributors defend targeting of non-combatants, while Jeremy Waldron discusses the morality associated with the tactic and argues against its use. Jeff McMahan identifies the problematic nature of targeted killing and emphasizes regulations for law enforcement to avoid abuse of process. Richard V. Meyer writes that any entity wishing to carry out targeted killing should first have to declare war on the targeted parties. [...] Kevin H. Govern examines the elimination of Osama Bin Laden and identifies this killing as justified and the product of a rational decision-making process. In the final portion of the book, Fernando Tesón says that targeted killing is particularly <b>justified</b> <b>against</b> terrorists because they use tactics specifically designed to kill civilians.|$|E
500|$|The final {{portion of}} the book {{analyzes}} consequentialism {{within the scope of}} normative ethics and deontological ethics. Florida State University Tobias Simon Eminent Scholar Fernando Tesón writes in his essay [...] "Targeted Killing in War and Peace: A Philosophical Analysis" [...] that targeted killing is particularly <b>justified</b> <b>against</b> terrorists because they use tactics specifically designed to kill civilians. University of Illinois law and philosophy professor Michael Moore says in [...] "Targeted Killings and the Morality of Hard Choices" [...] that targeted killing can be seen as justified through both deontological and consequentialist models. University of Pennsylvania School of Law professor Leo Katz writes in [...] "Targeted Killing and the Strategic Use of Self-Defense" [...] that there is a danger of a state government artificially generating instances in which it asserts it must use targeted killing in self-defense. He warns against situations in which governments find it easier to kill terrorists than to put them through due process of law. Katz concludes that current regulations support targeted killing because existing law does not consider his argument and justifies the tactical elimination of terrorists.|$|E

It is best used when the driver is on surface streets and cornering. A high speed motorist may kill innocent people and it can sometimes be justified for that traffic offense. Since there may be unwilling or innocent passengers in the car, there is an inherent difficulty in justifying the use of PITs.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] Hakkō ichiu did {{not enter}} general {{circulation}} until 1940, when the second Konoe administration issued a white paper titled [...] "Fundamental National Policy" [...] ( [...] Kihon Kokusaku Yōkō), which opened with these words, and in which Prime Minister Konoe proclaimed that the basic aim of Japan's national policy was [...] "the establishment of world peace in conformity with the very spirit in which our nation was founded" [...] and that {{the first step was}} the proclamation of a [...] "new order in East Asia" [...] ( [...] Tōa Shin Chitsujo), which later took the form of the [...] "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere". [...] In the most magnanimous form, the term was used to indicate the making of a universal brotherhood implemented by the uniquely virtuous Yamato.

It happens strangely, my Lord, that {{although}} throughout the seven volumes of Fors Clavigera, I never have set down a sentence without chastising it first into terms {{which could be}} literally {{as well as in}} their widest bearing <b>justified</b> <b>against</b> all controversy, you could perhaps not have found in the whole book, had your Lordship read it for the purpose, any saying quite so literally and terrifically demonstrable as this which you have chanced to select for attack.

60|$|He shall lie down! These words imply that, at last, {{the damned}} soul shall submit; for {{to lie down}} is an act that signifies submission, {{especially}} to lie down to be beaten. 'The wicked shall be silent in darkness' (1 Sam 2:9). When the malefactor has said and wished all that be can, yet at last he submits, is silent, and, as it were, helps to put {{his head into the}} halter, or doth lay down his neck upon the block; so here it is said of the damned--They shall lie down in sorrow. There is also a place that saith, 'These shall go away into everlasting punishment' (Matt 25:46). To go, to go to punishment, is also an act of submission. Now, submission to punishment doth, or should, flow from full conviction of the merit of punishment; and I think it is so to be understood here--For 'every mouth shall be stopped, and all the world (of soul losers) become guilty before God' (Rom 3:4,19; Luke 13:25-28; Matt 25:46). Every mouth shall be stopped, not {{at the beginning of the}} judgment, for then they plead, and pray, and also object against the Judge; but at the end, after that by a judicial proceeding He shall have <b>justified</b> <b>against</b> them His sayings, and have overcome these His judges, then they shall submit, and also lie down in s orrow; yea, they shall go away to their punishment as those who know they deserve it; yea, they shall go away with silence.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{theories}} {{of civil disobedience}} hold that civil disobedience is only <b>justified</b> <b>against</b> governmental entities. Brownlee argues that disobedience {{in opposition to the}} decisions of non-governmental agencies such as trade unions, banks, and private universities can be justified if it reflects [...] "a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken". The same principle, she argues, applies to breaches of law in protest against international organizations and foreign governments.|$|E

Despite over a century of research and development, maglev transport systems are in operation in just three countries (Japan, South Korea and China). The incremental benefits of maglev technology have often been hard to <b>justify</b> <b>against</b> cost and risk, especially where there is an existing or proposed conventional high speed train line with spare passenger carrying capacity, as in continental Europe, the UK and Japan.|$|R

5000|$|Right of {{self-defence}} - The {{theory of}} self-defence based on rational self-interest {{maintains that the}} use of retaliatory force is <b>justified</b> <b>against</b> repressive nations that break the non-aggression principle.

Thus, any means to achieve a swift and complete victory over the enemy is imperative. This view is prominently held by Objectivists.|$|E

40|$|While {{both men}} and women can, and do, use {{violence}} against each other, men 2 ̆ 7 s violence against women is far more common, less justified, and more destructive than women 2 ̆ 7 s violence against men. One of the reasons for this asymmetry is that men do not fear retaliation for violence against women, whereas women do fear retaliation for their use of violence against men. The distribution of violence between the genders, then, is suboptimal. Society would be better off as a whole if more women were willing to engage in <b>justified</b> violence <b>against</b> men, and fewer men were willing to engage in unjustified violence against women. To that end, women 2 ̆ 7 s <b>justified</b> violence <b>against</b> men should be encouraged, protected, and publicized. This will require a reversal of the current trend in legal and social practices, which is to tolerate and encourage men 2 ̆ 7 s unjustified violence against women while discouraging and legally restricting women 2 ̆ 7 s violence against men. Even if encouraging an increase in women 2 ̆ 7 s <b>justified</b> violence <b>against</b> men may sometimes result in unjustified or disproportionate violence in individual situations, the overall effects of the redistribution of violence will be preferable to the current asymmetry...|$|R

Some nonresistant Anabaptists found leaders in Menno Simons and the brothers Obbe and Dirk Philips, Dutch Anabaptist leaders who repudiated the distinctive doctrines of the Münster Anabaptists. This group eventually became known as the Mennonites after Simons. They rejected any use of violence and preached a faith based on love of enemy and compassion.|$|E
