5|$|Some hammocks are {{dominated}} by types of vegetation that grow {{in relation to the}} amount of water or type of soil present. The majority of hardwood hammocks create a thin poor soil covering the limestone called humus, made of decaying plant matter and moisture trapped by the structure of the trees. When peat forms the layer atop the limestone of a tree island, bayheads develop, dominated by bay trees such as sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana) and others like swamp holly (Ilex <b>decidua),</b> wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), and cocoplum (Chrysobalanus icaco). Willowheads, dominated by willow trees (Salix caroliniana), take hold where the hydroperiod is long, usually around solution or alligator holes, and may surround the holes, giving them a donut appearance from above.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{prolactin}} {{is produced}} {{at least in}} the anterior pituitary, <b>decidua,</b> myometrium, breast, lymphocytes, leukocytes and prostate. A key regulator of prolactin production is estrogens that enhance growth of prolactin-producing cells and stimulate prolactin production directly, as well as suppressing dopamine.|$|E

Leafy trees, especially maples, mainly grow in the Belianske Tatras.|$|E
40|$|During {{pregnancy}} {{the maternal}} immune {{system has to}} coordinate uterine spiral-artery remodelling, trophoblast invasion, and acceptance of the semi-allogenic fetus simultaneously. As dysregulation {{of the immune system}} is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, we analysed first-trimester <b>deciduas</b> of pregnancies for immune parameters in later complicated pregnancies. Higher IL 6 and macrophage mRNA expression, and lower ratios of regulatory macrophages were found in first-trimester <b>deciduas</b> of pregnancies later complicated with pregnancy-induced hypertension. Lower Gata 3 (Th 2) mRNA expression was found in <b>deciduas</b> of pregnancies with later foetal growth restriction. Our results suggest that adverse pregnancy outcomes are associated with immunological disturbances in first-trimester <b>deciduas.</b> (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, using immunohistochemistry, we studied the {{expression}} of CD 30 and CD 30 -L in 35 <b>deciduas</b> obtained from women following elective abortion during normal physiological gestation and in 60 <b>deciduas</b> obtained from women after spontaneous abortion with or without signs of inflammation. The main difference was noticed in the first trimester of gestation in which was found a decrease in CD 30 /CD 30 -L-positive decidual glandular and stromal cells in {{a greater number of}} cases of spontaneous abortions with respect to cases of physiological pregnancies (70 % vs 50 %, p< 0. 05). In addition, <b>deciduas</b> from spontaneous abortions with inflammation and without inflammation reacted similarly. The reduced expression of CD 30 and CD 30 -L and their cellular pattern detected in the <b>deciduas</b> from spontaneous abortions suggest that the CD 30 /CD 30 -L system is crucial for preventing abortions in the first trimester. And furthermore, the distinctive expression of CD 30 /CD 30 - L in <b>deciduas</b> from physiological pregnancies may indicate that the CD 30 /CD 30 -L system exerts its main role in the first trimester...|$|R

25|$|Relaxin is {{a hormone}} {{produced}} mainly by the corpus luteum of the ovary and breast, in both pregnant and non-pregnant females. During pregnancy {{it is also}} produced by the placenta, chorion, and <b>decidua.</b> The body produces relaxin during menstruation that rises to a peak within approximately 14 days of ovulation and then declines. In pregnant cycles, rather than subsiding, relaxin secretion continues to rise during the first trimester and then again in the final weeks. During pregnancy relaxin has a diverse range of effects, including the production and remodelling of collagen thus increasing the elasticity of muscles, tendons, ligaments and tissues of the birth canal in view of delivery.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The nuclear factor kappa B {{is widely}} {{expressed}} in the distinct subpopulations of chorionic villi and <b>deciduas</b> of first-trimester pregnancies. We examined the cellular distribution and expression of nuclear factor kappa B in the human first-trimester chorionic villi and <b>deciduas</b> of women with early spontaneous miscarriage and viable pregnancy by confocal laser scanning microscope and immunohistochemistry. There is a greater nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B is restricted to villous stromal cells, decidual stromal cells, glandular epithelial cells and vessel endothelial cells in early spontaneous miscarriage than in viable pregnancies. Collectively these observations suggest that over-activation of nuclear factor kappa B has a relationship with early spontaneous miscarriages...|$|R

2500|$|Most {{clinically}} apparent miscarriages (two-thirds to three-quarters {{in various}} studies) occur {{during the first}} trimester. About 30% to 40% of all fertilized eggs miscarry, often before the pregnancy is known. The embryo typically dies before the pregnancy is expelled; bleeding into the <b>decidua</b> basalis and tissue necrosis causes uterine contractions to expel the pregnancy. Early miscarriages can {{be due to a}} developmental abnormality of the placenta or other embryonic tissues. In some instances an embryo does not form but other tissues do.

60|$|The {{phenomenon}} of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between {{the kitchen and}} the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised <b>decidua</b> of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50 degrees to 212 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E

However, the histology showed fragments of necrotic degenerative and calcified chorionic villi and <b>deciduas.</b> An MRI scan also suggested retained products of conception. The {{possibility of a}} placenta accreta was also entertained, but this was ruled out by the histology and MRI.|$|R
5000|$|Fetal {{fibronectin}} (fFN) {{has become}} an important biomarker—the presence of this glycoprotein in the cervical or vaginal secretions indicates that {{the border between the}} chorion and <b>deciduas</b> has been disrupted.

[...] It has been shown that only 1% of women in questionable cases of preterm labor delivered within the next week when the test was negative.|$|R

Here lies the broken tank, the normal construction of El-Islam's flourishing days. It is a square of thirty-two metres, whose faces and angles do not front the cardinal points. At each corner a flight of steps has been; two have almost disappeared, {{and the others are}} very shaky. The floor, originally stone-paved, is now a sheet of hard silt, growing trees and bush: dense Tanzub-clumps (Sodada <b>decidua),</b> with edible red berries, sheltering a couple of birds'-nests, suggested a comparison between the present and the past. At the east end is the Makhzan el-Máyah, or [...] "smaller reservoir," [...] an oblong of 7.80 by 6.60 metres: the waggon-tilt roof has disappeared, and the fissures show brick within the ashlar. Along the eastern side are huge standing slabs of the coarse new sandstone with which the tank is lined: these may be remains of a conduit. Around the cistern lies a ruined graveyard, whose yawning graves supplied a couple of skulls. A broken line of masonry, probably an aqueduct, runs south-south-east (143° mag.) towards the palms: after two hundred metres all traces of it are lost.|$|E

40|$|In general, {{perennial}} species contain higher {{concentrations of}} certain secondary compounds, such as phenolics, {{lower levels of}} nitrogenous compounds, and greater specific leaf mass (SLM) than deciduous species. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify whether the comparative data reported in the literature regarding deciduous and evergreen species, also applies to four selected species of a semideciduous tropical forest (a remnant of the Atlantic Forest). The four species chosen for this study, each with apparently different leaf life spans, were two semideciduous (Hymenaea courbaril L. var. stilbocarpa (Hayne) Lee et Lang., and Lonchocarpus guilleminianus (Tul.) Malme, and two deciduous (Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.) Morong., and Peltophorum dubium (Spreng.) Taub.). Plants were grown in a greenhouse in plastic pots containing soil taken from their natural habitat. Mature leaves were harvested for determination of the SLM and contents of phenolic compounds, tannins, nitrate, protein, free amino acids, chlorophyll, and nitrogen. Data registered are in agreement with those of the literature. Leaves with the longest life span had the highest content of phenolics and the lowest levels of tannins, nitrate, protein, amino acids, chlorophyll and nitrogen, as well as presenting the greatest SLM.

Malme) e duas <b>decíduas</b> (Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Vell.) Morong. e Peltophorum dubium (Spreng.) Taub.). As plantas foram cultivadas em vasos plásticos, contendo solo da mata. O cultivo foi feito em casa de vegetação. Folhas maduras foram coletadas para análise de fenóis totais, taninos condensados, nitrato, proteínas totais, aminoácidos livres totais, clorofila total, nitrogênio total e MFE. Os resultados obtidos corroboram os da literatura, já que as espécies com folhas mais longevas apresentaram concentrações maiores de fenóis totais, menores de taninos condensados, nitrato, proteínas solúveis totais, aminoácidos livres totais, clorofilas totais, nitrogênio total e maior MFE...|$|R

40|$|Studies on {{alkaloids}} of Capparis <b>deciduas</b> {{have led}} the isolation of four novel speridine alkaloids named capparidisine, capparisine, capprisinine and N-acetyl capparisine. Capparidisine has the molecular formula C 27 H 33 N 3 O 6 (mol. wt. 495). It is a macrocyclic alkaloid containing two methoxylated and hydroxylated trans cinnamic acid residues which are linked to each other through oxygen bridge and to spermidine through amide bonds. Capparisine (C 26 H 31 N 3 O 5) has the same skeletal system but one methoxy groups less than capparidisine. The third alkaloid capparisinine is an isomer of capparidisine with the methoxy group at different position. The fourth alkaloid is N-acetyl capparisine has molecular formula C 28 H 33 N 3 O 6.
