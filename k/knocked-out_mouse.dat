40|$|INTRODUCTION: Fabry {{disease is}} an X-linked {{recessive}} abnormality of glycosphingolipid metabolism that {{is due to}} deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: A majority of hemizygous men develop severe multisystemic disease (classic form), dominated by renal failure, progressive neurological and cardiac involvement. Nevertheless, some affected men retain sufficient enzyme activity and long remain asymptomatic (atypical form); their main manifestation is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Female heterozygous carriers are usually asymptomatic; 15 % of them, however, have severe involvement of one or several organs. Laboratory, histologic and molecular diagnosis identifies 100 % of hemizygous and over 80 % of heterozygous subjects. FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: With developments in molecular genetics, {{it is now possible}} to produce the human recombinant enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. Two recent studies had proven that this therapeutic approach was able to be clinically and histologically effective in men. In addition, the results of a trial of gene therapy in a Fabry gene <b>knocked-out</b> <b>mouse</b> appear promising...|$|E

40|$|Based on a <b>knocked-out</b> <b>mouse</b> {{model and}} a few {{expression}} studies, TLX 3 {{is regarded as a}} homeobox gene crucial {{for the development of the}} autonomic nervous system. This gene can undergo rearrangements or deregulation, giving rise to T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. The present report is focused on the identification of elements and factors playing a role in the TLX 3 physiologic expression regulation and therefore likely to be involved in cancer development. In particular, after identifying the transcription start points, we have made use of in vitro transfection assays to show that the 5 ¶-untranslated region of the gene is necessary for the basal promoter activity in cell lines from different origin. By site-directed mutagenesis, two tandem CCAAT boxes have been localized as critical elements of this region. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays have indicated that nuclear factor Y (NFY) recognizes these sites in all the analyzed cell lines. The physiologic role of such an interaction has been confirmed by a dominant-negative version of the NFY transcription factor that has turned out to decrease both in vitro TLX 3 promoter activity and endogenous amount of mRNA. Finally, a consistent in vivo TLX 3 expression impairment was also achieved after NFY mRNA knockdown. The full characterization of the TLX 3 transcription regulation will ultimately provide crucial elements to define the involvement of this gene in T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia development.

40|$|Abstract: Gastric cancer (GC) {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{malignant}} diseases worldwide, especially in Asia. It is classified into intestinal and diffuse types. While the intestinal-type GC (IGC) is almost certainly caused by Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection, its role in the diffuse-type GC (DGC) appears limited. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on Japanese and Chinese populations identified chromosome 1 q 22 as a GC susceptibility locus which harbors mucin 1 gene (MUC 1) encoding a cell membrane-bound mucin protein. MUC 1 has been known as an oncogene with an anti-apoptotic function in cancer cells; however, in normal gastric mucosa, it is anticipated that the mucin 1 protein has a role in protecting gastric epithelial cells from a variety of external insults which cause inflammation and carcinogenesis. HP infection is the most definite insult leading to GC, and a protective function of mucin 1 protein has been suggested by studies on Muc 1 <b>knocked-out</b> <b>mice...</b>|$|R

Hence, <b>knocked‑out</b> <b>mice</b> for cRel had a significantly higher mortality, providing new and important functions of cRel in the physiopathology of septic shock. Whether genetic variants in the human REL gene are associated with severity of septic shock is unknown. Methods: We genotyped a population of 1040 ICU patients with septic shock and 855 ICU controls for two known polymorphisms of REL; REL rs 842647 and REL rs 13031237. Outcome of patients {{according to the presence}} of REL variant alleles was compared. Results: The distribution of REL variant alleles was not significantly different between patients and controls. Among the septic shock group, REL rs 13031237 *T minor allele was not associated with worse outcome. In contrast, REL rs 842647 *G minor allele was significantly associated with more multi‑organ failure and early death [OR 1. 4; 95 % CI (1. 02 – 1. 8) ]. Conclusion: In a large ICU population, we report a significant clinical association between a variation in the human REL gene and severity and mortality of septic shock, suggesting {{for the first time a}} new insight into the role of cRel in response to infection in humans...|$|R

Slow [Ca 2 +] transients, as elicited during depletion of Ca 2 + stores, Ca 2 + store repletion and hypo-osmotic swelling were able to activate calpain. On return to resting conditions, calpain activity recovered its basal rate within 10 min. In resting intact muscle, μ-calpain was predominantly in the 80 kDa native form, with a small fraction in the 78 kDa autolysed form. The latter is thought to be responsible for the activity measured in our conditions. Calpain activity in mdx fibres showed an average 1. 5 -fold increase compared to activity in C 57 fibres. This activity was reduced by a 10 -fold lowering of [Ca 2 +]o. Calpain- 3 -deficient fibres showed about the same increase, thus calpain- 3 did not contribute to the activity measured here and calpain activation is not specific to dystrophin deficiency. In fibres from transgenic mice over-expressing calpastatin, a 40 – 50 % reduction of calpain activity was observed, as with synthetic drugs (Z-Leu-Leu-CHO and SNT 198438).

40|$|BackgroundVascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Hypoxia Inducible Factor- 1 α (HIF- 1 α) {{are both}} {{positive}} regulators of angiogenesis. The soluble form of VEGF receptor 1 (sVEGFR 1 or sFlt- 1) traps circulating VEGF {{and is therefore}} anti-angiogenic. An emerging concept is that adenosine, known for its cardioprotective effects, {{is a major factor}} driving angiogenesis, thus contributing to the repair of the ischemic heart. The aims of the present study were (1) to characterize the effects of adenosine on VEGF and sFlt- 1, (2) to determine which subtype(s) of adenosine receptor (A 1, A 2 a, A 2 b, A 3) promote these effects. MethodsHuman primary cardiac fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and blood monocyte-derived macrophages were treated with adenosine (10 μm) or adenosine analogs, and/or LPS (100 ng/ml). In vitro formation of microtubules by human coronary artery cells (HCAEC) was used as an angiogenesis assay. Transgenic mice with cardiacspecific and inducible overexpression of A 1 and A 2 a receptors were used. Wild type (WT) and A 3 adenosine receptor <b>knocked-out</b> <b>mice</b> were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC). ELISA, realtime quantitative PCR, flow cytometry and immunoblotting were used to measure levels of VEGF, HIF- 1 α and sFlt- 1. ResultsAdenosine increased VEGF mRNA and protein expression by human primary fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and macrophages (22 -fold increase in adenosine- and LPS-treated macrophages, P< 0. 0001). Up-regulation of VEGF by adenosine was replicated using agonists of A 2 a (C 141) and A 3 (IB-MECA) receptors, and inhibited by antagonists of A 2 a (SCH 58261) and A 2 b (MRS 1754) receptors. sFlt- 1 production induced by LPS was decreased by 43 % in the presence of adenosine (P= 0. 006). Adenosine enhanced the formation of a network of microtubules by HCAEC and this effect was dampened in the presence of VEGF-blocking antibody. Over-expression of the A 2 a receptor in mice enhanced VEGF and HIF- 1 α expression. TAC increased VEGF and HIF- 1 α expression in the heart, an effect inhibited in A 3 -deficient mice. ConclusionAdenosine {{plays a major role in}} angiogenesis through up-regulation of the pro-angiogenic VEGF and down-regulation of the anti-angiogenic sFlt- 1. These effects appear to be mainly mediated by the A 2 a receptor. Our results suggest that both A 2 a and A 3 receptors play significant roles in adenosine-mediated angiogenesis...|$|R

However, {{little is known}} about the contribution of rare, large effect genetic variants to UC susceptibility. In this study, we performed a deep targeted re-sequencing of 122 genes in Dutch UC patients in order to investigate the contribution of rare variants to the genetic susceptibility to UC. The selection of genes consists of 111 established human UC susceptibility genes and 11 genes that lead to spontaneous colitis when <b>knocked-out</b> in <b>mice.</b> In addition, we sequenced the promoter regions of 45 genes where known variants exert cis-eQTL-effects. Targeted pooled re-sequencing was performed on DNA of 790 Dutch UC cases. The Genome of the Netherlands project provided sequence data of 500 healthy controls. After quality control and prioritization based on allele frequency and pathogenicity probability, follow-up genotyping of 171 rare variants was performed on 1021 Dutch UC cases and 1166 Dutch controls. Single-variant association and gene-based analyses identified an association of rare variants in the MUC 2 gene with UC. The associated variants in the Dutch population could not be replicated in a German replication cohort (1026 UC cases, 3532 controls). In conclusion, this study has identified a putative role for MUC 2 on UC susceptibility in the Dutch population and suggests a population-specific contribution of rare variants to U...|$|R
40|$|International audienceToll-like {{receptor}} (TLR) 4 agonists {{have emerged}} as {{a new group of}} molecules used for cancer therapy. They have been exploited to enhance the immunogenicity of current chemotherapeutic regimens. However, their effects on cancer cells remain elusive. Here, we showed that a TLR 4 agonist, namely a synthetic lipid A analog (ALA), OM- 174, exhibits antitumor effects in several mammary tumor mouse models. We also showed that immune components are involved in such effects, as attested to by the failure of ALA to induce tumor regression or an increase of animal survival in <b>mice</b> <b>knocked-out</b> for interferon γ (IFNγ) or TLR 4. TLR 4 and IFNγ receptor (INFR 2) expressed by cancer cells are involved in the antitumor efficacy of ALA since this last did not inhibit tumor growth in mice bearing a tumor but lacking TLR 4 or IFNγ receptor 2 (IFNR 2). Mechanistic investigations revealed that nitric oxide (NO), superoxide and peroxynitrite produced by uncoupling of inducible NO synthase (NOS II) in cancer cells are key mediators of ALA and IFNγ-mediated tumor growth inhibition.

Studies {{have revealed}} its roles in various disease, however, whether SHP- 2 involves in renal fibrosis remains unclear. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the roles of myeloid cells SHP- 2 in renal interstitial fibrosis. Methods: Myeloid cells SHP- 2 gene was conditionally <b>knocked-out</b> (CKO) in <b>mice</b> using loxP-Cre system, and renal interstitial fibrosis was induced by unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO). The total collagen deposition in the renal interstitium was assessed using picrosirius red stain. F 4 / 80 immunostaing was used to evaluate macrophage infiltration in renal tubular interstitium. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay were used to analyze the production of cytokines in the kidney. Transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling stain was used to assess the apoptotic renal tubular epithelial cells. Results: Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase- 2 gene CKO in myeloid cells significantly reduced collagen deposition in the renal interstitium after UUO. Macrophage infiltration was evidently decreased in renal tubular interstitium of SHP- 2 CKO mice. Meanwhile, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was significantly suppressed in SHP- 2 CKO mice. However, no significant difference was observed in the number of apoptotic renal tubular epithelial cells between wild-type and SHP- 2 CKO mice. Conclusions: Our observations suggested that SHP- 2 in myeloid cells plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis, and that silencing of SHP- 2 gene in myeloid cells may protect renal from inflammatory damage and prevent renal fibrosis after renal injury...|$|R
40|$|Antigen induced {{arthritis}} is a murine experimental {{model of}} rheumatoid arthritis induced by methylated bovine serum albumin. One {{of the main}} characteristics of joint inflammation is synovial hyperplasia, whereas hyperplastic synovium in arthritis contains mesenchymal progenitors with reduced ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondroblasts or adipocytes. Since Fas {{has been shown to}} inhibit osteoblast differentiation, {{the purpose of this study}} was to determine whether synovia-derived osteoblasts express Fas in vitro; describe the role of Fas in apoptosis and differentiation of synovia-derived osteoblasts in vitro; as well as elucidate the in vivo role of Fas deficiency in antigen induced arthritis. Fas receptor was weakly expressed on synovia-derived osteoblasts. Fas activation increased the number of apoptotic immature osteoblasts in vitro but the number was smaller than the proportion of Fas expressing osteoblasts. Addition of activating anti-Fas antibody did not induce apoptosis of mature osteoblasts. Despite the limited induction of apoptosis, Fas activation significantly inhibited differention od synovia-derived osteoblasts in vitro. In order to assess the in vivo effect of Fas deficiency, I used the experimental model of antigen induced arthritis in wild-type <b>mice</b> and <b>mice</b> <b>knocked-out</b> for Fas gene (Fas –/–). Arthritis was induced by intraarticular injection of methylated bovine albumine into the knees of animals pre-immunized by the same antigen. The changes of knee joints were compared with control mice injected by phosphate buffered saline, 14 days after intraarticular injection. Knee diameters were significantly increased in wild-type mice with induced arthritis compared to their controls, while this increase was not significant in Fas –/– mice. Histology revealed pronounced inflammatory parameters in joints of wild-type mice with arthritis, while the inflammation in arthritis-induced Fas –/– mice was significantly less developed. Histomorphometric analysis showed a decreased trabecular bone volume, trabecular number and thickness, as well as increased trabecular separation in wild-type mice with arthritis compared to controls. Additionally, micro-computerized tomography analysis showed that wild-type mice with arthritis had a decreased trabecular bone volume and trabecular number, as well as increased trabecular separation compared to controls. Described changes in trabecular bone were not found in Fas –/– mice with arthritis, whose bone parameters were similar to those of controls. In vitro osteoblast differentiation from both synovial mesenchymal cells and bone marrow cells was increased in wild-type mice with induced arthritis, whereas only osteoblast differentiation from bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells was increased in arthritic Fas –/– mice. The main conclusion of this study is that the Fas/FasL system regulates the number and differentiation od synovia-derived osteoblasts, which is only partially related to the induction of apoptotic cell death but dominantly to the inhibition of osteoblastogenesis. Fas deficiency has a protective role in local and juxtaarticular bone loss in antigen induced arthritis...|$|R
40|$|A. Background Skin {{wound healing}} (WH) {{is a dynamic}} and {{extremely}} determinate process of cellular, humoral and molecular mechanisms which begins directly after wounding and can last for years. WH is described as is an intricate {{process in which the}} skin (or another organ-tissue) repairs itself after injury. The process of skin WH occurs through the actions of an interplay of cells, growth factors and cytokines leading to wound closure. WH occurs in three precisely and highly programmed phases: the inflammatory phase (day 0 to day 7) followed by the proliferative phase or vasculogenic phase (day 7 to day 21) and finally the remodeling phase (2 days - up to 2 years). For a successful healing, all three phases must occur in the proper sequence and time frame. Many factors can interfere with one or more phases of the WH process, thus causing improper or impaired healing. The proliferation phase, in particular, requires the participation of various cells types such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells (ECs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), to produce a healthy well-vascularized granulation tissue for epithelization and wound closure. A. 1 Wound Healing And Obesity In 2008, over 1. 4 billion adults, 20 and older, were overweight. Of these, obesity has been shown to affect over 500 million people (OMS website). Moreover, the prevalence of obesity continues to rise, and by 2018, it is estimated that obesity will cost $ 347 billion annually. Each year, in the US, approximately 33 million overweight and obese patients undergo surgery. Obesity causes a number of known health problems and increased post-surgical complications such as wound infection, dehiscence, hematoma and seroma. Surgeons anecdotally report WH complications among obese patients; however, little research has been conducted to investigate the mechanisms mediating impaired obesity-related WH. Some previous work on diabetic patients and diabetic mice showed an imbalance between pro-oxydant and anti-oxydant genes as well as impaired EPCs proliferation and tube formation during the WH process. More then a hundred cytologic factors have been found to impair WH in the type 2 diabetic patient. It is a very complex and multifactorial problem involving decreased growth factors secretion, impaired keratinocyte and fibroblast functions, impaired EPs function, alteration of the macrophage function and granulation tissue synthesis, etc. Based on these findings and because obesity is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes, we hypothetize that, impaired balance between pro-apoptotic/anti-apoptotic and pro- oxydant /anti-oxydant genes is involved in impaired WH. Furthermore, we hypothetize that impaired EPCs function leads to the perturbation of the proliferation phase of obesity impaired WH. A. 2. Wound Healing and Age The world population is aging; by 2030, nearly 20 % of Americans, (± 72 million people), will be 65 years old and older. In 2010, 17 % of the European population was over the age of 65. By 2060, it is projected that the share of those aged 65 and over will rise to 30 %, accounting for more then 150 million people. (ec. europa. eu) These aging subjects undergo an increasing number of surgical procedures: in the past two decades, the percentage of surgeries in patients over 65 has doubled to nearly 40 %. As a corollary, it is well established knowledge that elderly WH is impaired. However, {{little is known about the}} underlying mechanisms of age-related impaired WH. As previously mentioned, adult BM-derived EPCs contribute to peripheral tissue repair and regeneration. In light of the abundant literature suggesting that neovascularization is impaired in the elderly, we characterize a novel model of senile cutaneous WH and investigate the role that vasculogenesis plays in the pathogenesis of age related impaired WH. Aged mice colonies have traditionally been the model for aged small mammalian research, however, the ability to use a readily-available transgenic mouse model with features of accelerated aging would aid in the exploration of targeted therapies and a great number of age-related investigations. We hypothesize that the Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) Zmpste 24 deficient (Zmpste 24 -/-) mouse mimics physiological ageing and can be used as a novel model for the study of senescent WH. We further hypothetized that impaired balance between pro-apoptotic/anti-apoptotic and pro-oxydant /anti-oxydant genes as well as impaired EPCs function are responsible for the impairment of the proliferative phase, leading to overall impaired WH. A. 3 Aims Recently, a great deal of research has been directed at understanding the critical factors inducing poorly healing wounds. However, a lot remains unclear. It is now well accepted that new blood vessel formation occurs not only by angiogenesis (blood vessels formation from a preexisting network of capillaries), but also by vasculogenesis (blood vessels formation from BM SCs recruitment) and that EPCs contribute to as much as 25 % of new blood vessels formed in healing tissues 4. They are mobilized from the BM in response to injury and production of local cytokines, are incorporate into wounds and play an integral role in systemic tissue repair. Based on this finding, we hypothesized that co-morbidities related impaired WH may be due, in part, to decreased EPCs number, migration/homing, and/or function resulting in impaired vasculogenesis. Because age and/or obesity have been shown to be one of the most common predictors of altered WH, we decided to focus on these two parameters. Following a bedside to bench approach the purpose of this work was to 1) develop coherent and translatable models of co-morbidity digging in the physiologic/pathologic mechanisms underlying altered healing in obese and senile mice; 2) develop targeted therapeutics to improve impaired WH. B. Material and Methods B. 1 Human Model Since obesity impairs WH and BM EPCs are important for tissue repair, we hypothesize that obesity- impaired WH is due, in part, to impaired EPCs mobilization, trafficking, and function. Peripheral blood was obtained from non diabetic, obese (BMI > 30, n = 25), and non obese (BMI As for aged impaired WH, EPCs of aged subjects have already been found to have decreased adhesion, migration and proliferative properties as well as being decreased in number in elderly patients undergoing surgery compared to younger patients. B. 2. Mice Models Two models of WH were developed and characterized. In order to isolate the effect of obesity on EPCs and WH, OB non-diabetic female TallyHo/JngJ mouse were selected (Female mice don’t express hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia). Female SWR/J non-OB mice were used as control mice. In order to limit variables, TallyHO/JngJ obese mice were selected over other OB mice that exhibit a polygenic type of obesity (Jackson Laboratory Website). By selecting this mouse model, we have excluded in our selection of the ideal model common confounding factors such as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, immune disorders. Zmpste 24 is a metalloproteinase involved in the maturation of lamin A (LmnA), an essential component of the nuclear envelope. When Zmpste 24 or LmnA are <b>knocked-out,</b> <b>mice</b> exhibit profound nuclear architectural abnormalities and histopathological defects that phenocopy an accelerated aging process. Of crucial importance, the lamin-A dependent nuclear alterations seen in Zmpste 24 -deficient mice have also been found in human physiological aging. We defined the utilization of the Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) Zmpste 24 deficient (Zmpste 24 - /-) mouse as a novel model for the study of senescent WH (controls used were C 57 BL/ 6 J mice). B. 3. Wounding Model and Data Collection All mice group underwent wounding using a stented wound model developed in our laboratory and previously published. Briefly, paired 6 -mm circular, full-thickness wounds extending through the panniculus carnosus were made on the dorsal skin of the mouse. An O-ring, 12 -mm splint made of silicone sheeting was then sutured to the skin around the wound. To minimize wound contraction and reliably recapitulated the granulation and re-epithelialization seen in human WH by secondary intention. Time to wound closure was measured using standardized digital photographs taken on days 0, 7, 14, and 21. Wound closure was calculated as a percentage of the original wound. For each model, EPCs were harvested, quantified by flow-cytometry and their function tested. Wounds were harvested at various time points and RNA, DNA and protein analysis were conducted. Finally immunohistochemistry to assess epidermal thickness, vascularity and WH were also realized. In a second step, after characterization of the models, local (using targeted siRNA gel) and systemic therapies (using AMD 3100, a PC mobilizer) were applied on the wounds and compared to controls. WH was monitored. We conducted the previously mentioned analysis (RT-PCR, ELISA and DNA analysis) on the harvested samples. All values are expressed as a mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). The number of mice per treatment group was determined using G*Power (G*Power©, Melbourne, Australia) to provide a power greater than 0. 80. Student T test was realized to compare two groups among each other. C. Results C. 1. Human EPCs Have Impaired Function There was no difference in the number of baseline circulating human EPCs in non-diabetic OB and non-OB subjects, but EPCs from OB subjects had impaired adhesion (p C. 2. Obesity and Wound Healing TallyHo/JgnJ OB mice demonstrated significantly impaired healing when compared to SWR/J control mice.

Age and Wound Healing In these experiments, we show that not only is Zmpste 24 -/- WH impaired when compared to C 57 BL/ 6 J mice (Zmpste 24 -/- mice healed at average 40 days ± 2 days p Histological analysis was performed utilizing hematoxylin and eosin staining to assess epidermal thickness, CD 31 immunofluorescence to assess vascular density, p 53 and caspase 3 to assess apoptosis, 8 ’OHdG staining to assess DNA damage and PCNA to assess proliferation. Epidermal thickness was significantly decreased in Zmpste 24 -/- animals compared to WT as well as vascular density, and proliferation in Zmpste 24 -/- wound tissue (p Circulating vasculogenic EPCs recruitment was impaired in Zmpste 24 -/- mice and their wounds showed significantly decreased new blood vessel formation through decreased HIF- 1 α/SDF- 1 α signaling (p In the treatment phase, local p 53 silencing consistently improved healing by more then a two fold (18 ± 2 days). VEGF production was significantly increased and pro-apoptotic factors were significantly downregulated in siRNA-treated Zmpste 24 -/- mice (p Because EPCs showed impaired function, lower peripheric blood counts and impaired SDF- 1 α/HIF- 1 α signaling, we hypothesized that improving their mobilization by using a progenitor cell mobilizer, AMD 3100, known to mobilize SCs from the BM, in a systemic treatment phase will improve WH. Peripheral blood counts were significantly increased and time to wound closure significantly decreased (20 days ± 2, p D. Conclusions Obesity impaired wound closure is a complex problem with many contributory factors. Our results suggest that obesity impairs the BM-derived EPCs response to peripheral injury and this, in turn, impairs wound closure. This impairment is associated with decreased new blood vessel formation and increased DNA damage leading to an increase in the p 53 pathway. We also demonstrate that targeted siRNA therapy can partially rescue impaired WH due to obesity. Based on these results we support the encouraging argument that, WH and closure has the potential be improved through specific local and systemic therapies in vivo in our rodent model and that further studies are needed to support this in a clinical environment. Impaired WH due to ageing is a complex phenomenon that is partially understood. We demonstrate that the Zmpste 24 -/- transgenic knockout mouse provides a model for age-related WH investigation. Zmpste 24 -/- animals heals their wounds with significant delays, showed impaired EPCs mobilization following wounding through an impaired HIF- 1 α/SDF- 1 α pathway and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, WH can be improved through specific local siRNA therapy and systemic stem cell mobilization therapies. Our results suggest strong similar patterns between obesity and ageing in the way they mediate WH impairments trough (premature) ageing. Our encouraging endeavor to bring WH back to baseline in these diseased models underlines the possibility to reverse the microenvironment alterations and improves EPCs contribution to the WH process. Because EPCs are involved in virtually every tissue repair process happening in the human body, we hope that this work will lead the way for new research in various fields in medicine to improve wound care and quality of life of patients.
