5000|$|In principle, {{provided}} {{the environment is}} aerobic, the longer the wastewater remains inside the filter, the greater the BOD5 and COD removal efficiency will be, but {{at the expense of}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loading.</b> Wastewater requires sufficient contact time with the biofilm to allow for the adsorption, transformation, and reduction of contaminants. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>loading</b> rate is an essential design parameter and equates to the volume and of wastewater that a vermifilter can reasonably treat in a given time. For a given system, higher <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loading</b> rates will cause hydraulic retention time to decrease and therefore reduce level of treatment. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>loading</b> rate may depend on parameters such as structure, effluent quality and bulk density of filter packing, along with method of effluent application. Common Hydraulic retention time values in vermifiltration systems range from 1 to 3 hours. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>loading</b> rates commonly vary between 0.2 m3 m−2 day−1, 3.0 m3 m−2 day−1 [...] or 10-20 g L−1.

50|$|Because {{the first}} seven ship of Type Long March {{were built in the}} era of Cultural Revolution, quality {{problems}} were rampant and severe {{as the result of the}} political turmoil at the time. After the lead ship went into service, cylinder heads of the main engine were damaged and had to be replaced after thirty-six thousand hours of operation. Forty seven valves had to be replaced at the cost of three thousand ¥ each. Both the axis of the main propulsion and axis of the rudder had been cracked while in operation. Another five ships of the class had to have the auxiliary power unit replaced at the cost of a hundred twenty thousand ¥ each. In addition, the cranes and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loading</b> system were nonetheless installed onboard all ships despite both failed to pass the certification tests. As a result, none of the ships had the capability to load and unload cargo as originally designed, but instead, must rely on cranes on the pier to do the loading and unloading.

As the result of the massive quality issues, most ships of this type had to return to dock to be reworked and repaired, as with other poor quality product made in China in the era of great political turmoil.|$|E

This report summaries the literature on the topic of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>loading</b> rates of on-site sewage systems.
