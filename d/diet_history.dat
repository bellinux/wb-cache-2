This study {{investigated}} whether {{ethnic differences in}} <b>dieting</b> <b>history</b> contributed to differences in body dissatisfaction and dietary control, or to differential changes that may occur during weight loss and regain. Eighty-nine EA and AA women underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure body composition and completed questionnaires to assess body dissatisfaction and dietary control before, after, and one year following, a controlled weight-loss intervention.

40|$|Although diets are {{currently}} the primary treatment for obesity, {{there are many}} psychological and physiological barriers to weight loss and maintenance, including the lack of reinforcement one obtains from dietary restriction. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the hypothesis that a more extensive <b>dieting</b> <b>history</b> is correlated with more negative thoughts, or schemata, about diets. One hundred fifty participants, including current dieters (28), past dieters (61), and non-dieters (61) took a survey that included questions about <b>dieting</b> <b>history,</b> the Revised Restraint Scale, the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT- 26), and the Diet Schemata Questionnaire. Correlations and one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted, and the study’s main hypothesis was not supported by the data.

40|$|Cystinuria is {{a genetic}} disease {{that leads to}} {{frequent}} cystine stone formation. A reduced methionine (precursor to cystine) diet has been recommended for cystinuria patients, involving maintenance of healthy weight, limiting intake of animal protein and salt whilst increasing vegetable protein, fruit, vegetables and fluid intake. The ability of patients to adhere to these dietary regimes has been questioned. We evaluated the dietetic service and dietary changes within our multidisciplinary cystinuria clinic using food frequency questionnaires (ffqs), dietary change questionnaires (dcqs) and <b>diet</b> <b>histories.</b> Most patients were seen by the dietitian 6 – 12 monthly. 100 % of patients felt they benefited from dietetic input. There was a move away from ffqs due to them being difficult and cumbersome to complete.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{assesses the}} {{relative}} validity of a <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> interview in 56 free-living individuals with Type II diabetes mellitus. METHODS: The <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> interview {{was compared to}} a 3 -day food record in a 1 -year dietary intervention trial. The plausibility of energy intake data was examined throughout the trial. Paired data were compared for differences {{and the presence of}} systematic error was determined by Bland Altman analysis. Changes in accuracy and responsiveness were assessed over time. RESULTS: The proportion of underreporters was larger in the <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> at baseline. Underrecording with the food record was more common in subjects with BMIs 3 ̆e 30 kg/m(2). There was no difference between paired dietary data from the two methods; however, data on fatty acids failed to correlate. These correlations improved when outliers were removed. There was no evidence of a relationship between bias and mean intake of dietary variables. Accuracy of <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> measurement did not change during the trial for energy or macronutrients, but data on protein and monounsaturated fat were both affected by BMI. The <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> was more responsive than the food record to changes in monounsaturated fatty acid intake after 3 months, but this changed {{at the end of the}} trial. CONCLUSION: The <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> provided good estimates of energy and macronutrient intakes in a sample group with Type II diabetes mellitus.

40|$|Objective: Investigation of {{relative}} bias in <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> measurement during dietary intervention trials. Design: Retrospective analysis of human dietary data from two randomised controlled trials examining modified fat diets {{in the prevention}} and treatment of type II diabetes mellitus. Setting: Wollongong, Australia. Subjects: Thirty-five overweight, otherwise healthy subjects in trial 1 and 56 subjects with diabetes in trial 2. Interventions: <b>Diet</b> <b>history</b> interviews and three-day weighed food records administered at one-month intervals in trial 1 and three-month intervals in trial 2. Results: In a cross-sectional bias analysis, graphs of the association between bias and mean dietary intake showed that bias decreased in higher carbohydrate consumers in trial 1 (r = − 0. 344, P 3 ̆c 0. 05). No other significant associations were found. In a longitudinal analysis, bias did not change over time in either trial. There {{were no significant differences}} in bias magnitudes between the trials, with the exception of monounsaturated fat measurement where bias was significantly greater and more positive in trial 2, indicating overestimation of monounsaturated fat intake with the <b>diet</b> <b>history.</b> Subjects in control and intervention groups underestimated energy, fat, saturated fat and alcohol intakes with the <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> in both trials. Overweight and obese individuals appeared to make the greatest contribution to the overall underestimation of saturated fat intake by the <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> regardless of whether they were in the control or intervention group and whether they were healthy or had diabetes. Conclusion: Bias in <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> measurement appears to be macronutrient-specific, with energy, fat and saturated fat consistently underreported in the interview by subjects with and without diabetes and in both intervention and control groups in a dietary intervention trial. Relative bias analysis appears to be an informative tool in quality control for dietary intervention trials when biochemical markers are unavailable...|$|E
40|$|Overweight {{and obesity}} {{is a global}} epidemic. Investigating food {{consumption}} combinations (FCCs) may offer useful insights into addressing eating behaviours to manage overweight and obesity. Using food intake data generated from a detailed dietary assessment method allows advanced analytical methods to be employed. Food intake data collected by a <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> interview {{appears to be more}} precise in terms of capturing the usual food intakes of individuals. Exploration of FCCs can be conducted using the Apriori algorithm, but this method is dependent on correct data preparation. Given the uncertainties related to collecting food intake data via <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> interviews, the aim {{of this study was to}} explore the feasibility of using food intake data derived from <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> interviews from three weight-loss clinical trials to investigate FCCs. A 10 % random sample (n= 62) of baseline paper-based <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> records, reflecting usual food intake by meal, from three registered clinical trials (n= 617) were extracted. FCCs were assessed by considering the sum of single food items consumed at the same time or in the same occasion using the United States Department of Agriculture Food Combination Codes and the nested hierarchical food groups of the 2011 - 13 Australian Health Survey food classification system. FCCs were identified in all <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> data records at the major food group level. A proportion of FCCs for the dinner meal (n= 13) were unable to be assessed at the specific food level due to limited detail for meat-containing FCCs. FCCs for the dinner meal created more challenges for accurately distinguishing and naming FCCs. Given the complexity of beverage reporting, combinations of foods and beverages were not revealed in the selected data set. In conclusion, despite a lack of meat-containing FCCs at dinner and food-beverage combinations, the food intake data collected using the <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> interview method can feasibly be used to investigate FCCs...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To examine {{association}} of residential conditions and past dieting with current dietary intake and body composi-tion of female pharmacy students. Participants and methods: The 24 -hour recall method {{was used to}} evaluate dietary intake of 47 female students. Height, weight and four skinfold thickness were measured to assess body composition. In addition, survey included lifestyle ques-tionnaire to obtain information on type of residence place in time of academic year and about diets continued at least by two weeks. The Mann Whitney U-test and correlation analysis were used. Results: Current energy and nutrient intake were related to <b>dieting</b> <b>history.</b> Female students with <b>dieting</b> <b>history</b> and liv-ing with their parents had significantly lower (p≤ 0. 05) intake of energy (61. 9 % RDI), carbohydrate (67. 5 % RDI), fat (58. 7 % RDI), phosphorus (111. 7 % RDI), magnesium (73. 4 % RDI) and thiamin (72. 3 % RDI) than those that have never dieted. A significant association (p≤ 0. 05) between past dieting and cur-rent body composition was also found. Compared to students who had never used diets and reside with their parents, stu-dents with past dieting behavior indicated significantly greater (p≤ 0. 05) indices as BMI and % FM.

40|$|Objective: To give an {{overview}} of the evaluation of the modified <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> applied in the SENECA study (Survey in Europe on Nutrition and the Elderly; a Concerted Action). Design: Nineteen centres in 12 countries participated at baseline. Nine of these SENECA centres conducted a repeat measurement scheme in elderly people born between 1913 and 1918. These longitudinal centres included 100 subjects per sex per site. Methods: The relative validity of the method was tested by comparing results of the modified <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> with results obtained from a weighed record in 82 subjects. In the follow-up we compared changes in energy intake with changes in body weight and calculated the physical activity ratio in all longitudinal centres. In SENECA's finale we examined the predictive value of dietary patterns observed at baseline for survival 10 years later, making use of the original and an adapted Mediterranean Diet Score. Results: The modified <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> overestimated intake, compared with the weighed record. However, the physical activity ratio and an in-depth study in a metabolic room indicated that the <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> rather underestimated energy intake.

40|$|Social {{desirability}} bias in food type selection {{may influence}} patient behaviour during <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> interviews; however, {{face to face}} <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> interviews do not allow for participant behaviours to be captured. To determine whether a relationship exists between the foods selected by the participant and observed behaviours, video data was analysed for n = 11 adult volunteers with type 2 diabetes mellitus using an automated <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> website. Participant log files showing time taken and item selection were downloaded from the website. Behaviours from the videos and food item selections from the log files were grouped, and matched for time of occurrence. The frequency and proportion of behaviours per food group were calculated. Trends between food group and behaviour group were determined using weighted chi-square analyses. Sixteen behaviour groups were constructed from 155 behaviours and 11 food groups were formed. Adjusted for voice alteration; the most commonly observed behaviour was non-computer interaction in the savoury sauces (14. 0 %) group; self touching of the face in the sugary foods (20. 2 %), and fats and oils (16. 9 %) groups; shifting in the chair in the takeaway food group (20. 2 %); and head movement (21. 6 %) in the alcoholic beverages group. Self-touching of the face, head movement, postural movement, and movement in chair were observed significantly more often than other behaviours across all food groups. Food type appears to influence behaviour during <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> interviews. This may have implications for the types of questions asked by dietitians during face to face <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> interviews...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} three studies are reported, which aim to {{investigate}} the performance of an interviewer-administered, open-ended <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> for the use in clinical studies where dietary variables are manipulated. The studies presented here are focused on validating self-reported macronutrient and energy intakes in Australian adults who have volunteered to participate in dietary intervention research. The evaluations are performed using food records, 24 -hour recalls and biochemical markers of intake for comparison. In addition, a pilot study is presented, which examines the ability of hair and sebaceous lipid composition to reflect dietary fatty acid intake in healthy volunteers. Clinical trials are the highest form of evidence for examining both the treatment and prevention of disease by dietary nutrients. Given this, {{it is imperative that}} these nutrients are measured as accurately as possible to avoid erroneous conclusions regarding their capabilities. Despite the importance of data from clinical trials, the literature relating to the performance of dietary assessment methods in this context is sparse. Despite evidence to show that food records and 24 -hour recalls are not always able to measure intake accurately, many dietary intervention trials are using these methods to measure dietary intake during the intervention period. Since the <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> method is used in clinical practice, albeit in a less rigorous manner, and the clinical trial is, in essence, a highly controlled form of clinical practice, examination of the <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> method in this research context is warranted. The first study in this thesis examined the validity of an interviewer-administered, open-ended, non-structured <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> in adults with Type II diabetes mellitus. The trial examined the viability of a high monounsaturated fat diet for the treatment of associated blood and insulin abnormalities. The dietary data were obtained retrospectively and the <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> was examined relative to a 3 -day food record using a number of statistical techniques. The results showed that the <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> method was able to measure both energy and macronutrient intakes reasonably well at both the group level and the individual level. There was, however, a failure to measure the fatty acid composition of the diet, which was due to a few outliers who reported discrepant values. Nethertheless, the relationship between paired data for these variables was significant once outliers were removed. There was no relationship between bias and intake indicating that systematic error was not operating in this group. An important finding from this study was the large proportion of individuals underreporting energy intake. This was not method-specific, but rather subject-specific and tended to occur in the larger individuals, however the use of a nutrient density model diluted in the effects of underreporting for comparisons of the <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> with the food record. The non-structured <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> method was found to estimate energy and nutrient intakes relatively well in a clinical population with Type II diabetes. The second study also used retrospective data from both the former study and another clinical trial, which examined the effects of a high monounsaturated fat diet on the prevention of diabetes in Australian adults with mild insulin resistance. The aim of this study was the compare the performance of the interviewer-administered, non-structured <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> between healthy individuals and individual with Type II diabetes mellitus undergoing similar intervention protocols with differing intensity. The results showed that the values measured by the DH in the healthy individuals were closer to those of the food record than in the individuals with Type II diabetes. Moreover, the degree of underreporting in the healthy individuals was significantly lower than in individuals with diabetes. Biases in the measurements of target nutrients also showed movement in different directions between the two sample groups. The third study was designed to fit within the research protocol of a dietary supplementation trials, which examined the effects of fish oil and soy isoflavone on the risk profile for cardiovascular disease. The study presented in this thesis aimed to assess the validity and reproducibility of a <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> method using both food records and multiple 24 hour recalls for reference, in addition to urine nitrogen and erythrocyte membrane phospholipid fatty acid composition as biomarkers of dietary intake. The biochemical markers not only provided information as to the performance of <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> method, but also the reference methods to determine if discrepancies between paired data were indeed due to <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> failings. The <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> method used in this study was slightly different to the aforementioned non-structured approach with the record of foods taking place on a structured meal-based form with food prompts for the dietitian. The allowed the dietitian to prompt for the context of eating as well as the foods consumed. Since the concern in this study was the accuracy of the data for a valid trial outcome, prompting was not considered to introduce bias, but rather to improve memory of foods consumed. The results showed that the <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> method was measuring higher absolute intakes of energy and macronutrients than both the food records and the 24 -hour recalls, however, both reference methods showed a higher degree of underreporting and an underestimation of nitrogen intake of energy and macronutirents than both the food record and the 24 hour recalls, however, both reference methods showed a higher degree of underreporting and an underestimation of nitrogen intake {{during the course of the}} intervention indicating that the reference methods were prone to underestimation. The <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> values also moved in line with those of the food record and the 24 -hour recall. In addition, the <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> was shown to be better at estimating long chain fatty acid intake than the food record for variables, which were of importance in a fish oil supplementation trial. Nevertheless, this study showed that the structured <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> method was both valid and reproducible for estimating macronutrient and energy intake in a sample of Australian adults participating in a dietary supplementation trial. The final study was designed in response to the lack of biomarkers available for fat intake. This study was pilot study, which aimed to investigate if the fatty acid composition of both hair and sebaceous secretions was related to the fatty acid composition of the diet. If a relationship was shown then a potential non-invasive method for assessing what may be a single or a few fatty acids in the usual diet was possible. The results showed that there were no significant relationships between hair or sebaceous fatty acid composition and corresponding dietary fatty acids due, in part, to large numbers of undetectable fatty acids in the different tissues, which prevented correlation. Future research will indicate if hair or sebaceous fatty acid composition is valuable for assessing changes in dietary fat. As a result of the studies presented in this thesis, the interviewer-administered, structured <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> method has been used in numerous studies to date conducted through the author�s institution and requests for its use continue as clinical dietitians conduct research within their own institutions. If anything, this thesis has shown that relative validation of dietary methods is valuable and should be done in context. The issues that affect persons participating in trials with large subject burdens are not the same for those who undertake just a validation study. The methods used in intervention trials needs to be validated within the context of the trial and its participants. However, objective markers should always be used as an adjunct to any validation study especially those that inform on absolute nutrient intake such as urine nitrogen. This thesis reports on a number of interesting limitations associated with measuring dietary intake in free-living individuals especially in larger individuals in the sample group. A number of interesting macronutrient-specific biases are also reported on in this work. Further research in dietary methodology should focus on the need for contextual validation of dietary methods since the administration environment affects the accuracy of the test method. In addition, clinical trails, which are dependent on nutrient targets for outcome, should make validation studies a priority and should question the accuracy of the reference methods used for validation purposes. This thesis has shown that the <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> interview is a valuable method for measuring dietary intake in clinical trials in free-living individuals. Of importance, is the contextual aspect of administration where the <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> would need to be validated in specific research environments, however, the studies presented here provide insight into the performance of the <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> method in clinical research...|$|E
40|$|Objective—The {{objective}} of this pilot study was to evaluate possible differences in insulin sensitivity, food intake, and cravings between the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle in women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Methods—Subjects were screened for PMS using the Penn Daily Symptom Rating (DSR) scale. Each subject had two overnight admissions (once in each cycle phase) to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. They performed 3 -day <b>diet</b> <b>histories</b> prior to each hospitalization. After admission, subjects received dinner and a snack, then were fasted until morning, when they underwent a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT). Insulin sensitivity was determined by Minimal Model analysis. Blinded analysis of <b>diet</b> <b>histories</b> and inpatient food intake was performed by a registered dietitian. Results—There was no difference found in insulin sensitivity between cycle phases (n = 7). There were also no differences in proportions of macronutrients or total kilocalories by cycle phase, despite a marked difference in food cravings between cycle phase, with increased food cravings noted in the luteal phase (p = 0. 002). Total DSR symptom scores decreased from a mean of 186 (± 29. 0) in the luteal phase to 16. 6 (± 14. 2) in the follicular phase. Women in this study consumed relatively high proportions of carbohydrates (55 %– 64 %) in both cycle phases measured. Conclusions—These findings reinforce the suggestion that although the symptom complaints of PMS are primarily confined to the luteal phase, the neuroendocrine background for this disorder may be consistent across menstrual cycle phases...|$|R
40|$|Food {{modelling}} {{systems such}} as the Core Foods and the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating are frequently used as nutritional assessment tools for menus in ‘well’ groups (such as boarding schools, prisons and mental health facilities), with the draft Foundation and Total Diets (FATD) the latest revision. The aim {{of this paper is}} to apply the FATD to an assessment of food provision in a long stay, ‘well’, group setting to determine its usefulness as a tool. A detailed menu review was conducted in a 1000 bed male prison, including verification of all recipes. Full <b>diet</b> <b>histories</b> were collected on 106 prisoners which included foods consumed from the menu and self funded snacks. Both the menu and <b>diet</b> <b>histories</b> were analysed according to core foods, with recipes used to assist in quantification of mixed dishes. Comparison was made of average core foods with Foundation Diet recommendations (FDR) for males. Results showed that the standard menu provided sufficient quantity for 8 of 13 FDRs, however was low in nuts, legumes, refined cereals and marginally low in fruits and orange vegetables. The average prisoner diet achieved 9 of 13 FDRs, notably with margarines and oils less than half and legumes one seventh of recommended. Overall, although the menu and prisoner diets could easily be assessed using the FDRs, it was not consistent with recommendations. In long stay settings other Nutrient Reference Values not modelled in the FATDS need consideration, in particular, Suggested Dietary Targets and professional judgement is required in interpretation. ...|$|R

Physical measurements (including fasting bloods) were taken and medical records reviewed. Results showed the standard food provided consistent with current dietary guidelines, however limited in menu choice. <b>Diet</b> <b>histories</b> revealed self-funded foods contributing 1 – 63 % of energy (mean = 30 %), 0 – 83 % sugar (mean = 38 %), 1 – 77 % saturated fats (mean = 31 %) and 1 – 59 % sodium (mean = 23 %). High levels of modification to food provided was found using minimal cooking amenities and inclusion of self-funded foods and/or foods retained from previous meals.

As with any food composition table or nutrient database there are limitations and potential sources of error that could contribute to inaccuracies in the final data (2). This paper reports on the limitations and potential sources of error the researcher or clinician {{should be aware of}} before using this new database. In a previous randomised cross-over study examining the effect of soy product consumption compared with dairy consumption, beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes was seen. The <b>diet</b> <b>histories</b> of these subjects provided an excellent starting point for examining the intake of individual fatty acids. The <b>diet</b> <b>histories</b> of 23 subjects previously analysed on FoodworksTM (Xyris Software, Brisbane, version 2. 10), using the Australian Nutrient Database NUTTAB and AUSNUT, were re-examined using the Australia fatty acid database attached to FoodworksTM (Xyris Software, Brisbane, version 3. 0), with regards to the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content. Conversion of volume amounts to gram amounts of each food item was completed before data entry was started. Substitution of some food items was required and was based on fat content, and ingredient similarity. Meat items were matched as closely as possible with regards to the area of cut and fat content. Comparison between the original FoodworksTM data and the FADB showed significant differences for total PUFA intake i...|$|R

40|$|Background: Dietary {{calcium and}} vitamin D are {{essential}} for bone development. Apart from diet, physical activity may potentially improve and sustain bone health. Objective: To investigate {{the relationship between the}} dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D, physical activity, and bone mineral content (BMC) in 13 -year-old Malaysian adolescents. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Selected public secondary schools from the central and northern regions of Peninsular Malaysia. Participants: The subjects were from the Malaysian Health and Adolescents Longitudinal Research Team Cohort study (MyHeARTs). Methods: The data included seven-day <b>diet</b> <b>histories,</b> anthropometric measurements, and the BMC of calcaneal bone using a portable broadband ultrasound bone densitometer. Nutritionist Pro software was used to calculate the dietary calcium and vitamin D intakes from the <b>diet</b> <b>histories,</b> based on the Nutrient Composition of Malaysian Food Database guidance for the dietary calcium intake and the Singapore Energy and Nutrient Composition of Food Database for vitamin D intake. Results: A total of 289 adolescents (65. 7 % females) were recruited. The average dietary intakes of calcium and vitamin D were 377 ± 12 mg/day and 2. 51 ± 0. 12 µg/day, respectively, with the majority of subjects failing to meet the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) of Malaysia for dietary calcium and vitamin D. All the subjects had a normal Z-score for the BMC (− 2. 00 or higher) with a mean of 0. 55 ± 0. 01. From the statistical analysis of the factors contributing to BMC, it was found that for those subjects with a higher intake of vitamin D, a higher combination of the intake of vitamin D and calcium resulted in significantly higher BMC quartiles. The regression analysis showed that the BMC might have been influenced by the vitamin D intake. Conclusions: A combination of the intake of vitamin D and calcium is positively associated with the BMC...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{accuracy}} of reporting from both a <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> and food record and identify some {{of the characteristics of}} more accurate reporters in a group of healthy adult volunteers for an energy balance study. DESIGN: Prospective measurements in free-living people. SETTING: Wollongong, Australia. SUBJECTS: Fifteen healthy volunteers (seven male, eight female; aged 22 - 59 y; body mass index (BMI) 19 - 33 kg/m(2)) from the local community in the city of Wollongong, Australia. INTERVENTIONS: Measurement of energy intake via <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> interview and 7 day food records, total energy expenditure by the doubly labelled water technique over 14 days, physical activity by questionnaire, and body fat by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Increased misreporting of energy intake was associated with increased energy expenditure (r= 0. 90,...|$|E

40|$|Inaccuracy in {{reporting}} dietary intakes {{is a major}} problem in managing diet-related disease. There is no single best method of dietary assessment, but the <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> lends itself well to the clinical setting. In many diet histories data are collected orally, so analysis of interviews can provide insights into reporting behaviors. Conversation analysis is a qualitative method that describes the systematic organization of talk between people. Patterns are identified and checked for consistency within and among individual interviews. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe consistent ways of reporting diet histories and to identify conversational features of problematic reporting. <b>Diet</b> <b>history</b> interviews from 62 overweight and insulin-resistant adult volunteers (50 women, 12 men) attending an outpatient clinic and 14 healthy volunteers (7 men, 7 women) participating in an energy balance study were audiotaped and transcribed. Conversation analysis identified a remarkably consistent pattern of reporting diet histories and 3 conversational features that indicated problematic reporting: 2 ̆ 2 it depends, 2 ̆ 2 denoting variability (least of all at breakfast); 2 ̆ 2 probably, 2 ̆ 2 suggesting guesswork (related to portion sizes); and elaborated talk on certain foods, distinguishing sensitive topics (e. g., alcohol, chocolate, butter/margarine, take-out foods) from safe topics. These findings indicate that there are ways in which dietetics practitioners may conduct the <b>diet</b> <b>history</b> interview to foster more accurate reporting...|$|E
