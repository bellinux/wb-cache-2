5|$|Bayley's {{tenure in}} Iron Maiden ended in January 1999 {{when he was}} asked to leave during a band meeting. The {{dismissal}} took place due to issues Bayley had <b>experienced</b> <b>with</b> his voice during the Virtual XI World Tour, although Janick Gers has since stated that this was partly the band's fault for forcing him to perform songs which were beyond his natural register.|$|E
5|$|Bicycles {{have been}} constructed, for {{investigation}} and demonstration purposes, with the steering reversed so that turning the handlebars {{to the left}} causes the front wheel {{to turn to the}} right, and vica versa. It is possible to ride such a bicycle, but it has been found that riders <b>experienced</b> <b>with</b> normal bicycles find it very difficult to learn, if they can manage it at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{animals were}} {{restored}} between 1975 and 1977 by Bill and Caroline Von Stein of Cincinnati, Ohio. The Von Steins were <b>experienced</b> <b>with</b> {{other types of}} museum conservation work, but had never restored carousel animals. Because of the animals' poor condition, no {{attempt was made to}} restore them to their original paintwork; instead, the restorers were allowed to use their judgment on color choices and other decorations. The museum's only requirements were that they use reasonably natural decorative schemes and no high-gloss paint.|$|E

5|$|The {{heart of}} a Whippet is large and slow beating, often being arrhythmic or even {{intermittent}} when the animal is at rest. This sometimes causes concern to the owner, or to the vet not <b>experienced</b> <b>with</b> the breed. Whippets will, however, demonstrate a regular heartbeat during exercise. In a health survey conducted by The Kennel Club cardiac problems were shown to be the second leading cause of mortality in Whippets.|$|E
5|$|Wrexham's squad {{included}} three Welsh internationals, Mickey Thomas, Gordon Davies and substitute Joey Jones. The first eleven was mostly composed of youth graduates, aged 20 years or under. By comparison, Arsenal's squad was greatly <b>experienced</b> <b>with</b> seven England internationals. Manager George Graham named a strong first eleven: David O'Leary {{came in for}} Bould to partner Tony Adams in defence, while Jimmy Carter made his second start for the club since joining in late 1991.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Nolan Bushnell saw Spacewar {{running on a}} {{mainframe}} at the University of Utah {{where he was a}} student. Bushnell worked during the summer at Lagoon Amusement Park in Utah as a manager of the games department overseeing the arcade games, and when he saw Spacewar he believed that an arcade game version of the game would be very popular. The high price of computers capable of running the game, however, meant that any such arcade game would not be economically feasible. After graduating from college Bushnell worked as an engineer in California for Ampex, an electronics company that worked in audio and video recording technology. He also met researcher Jim Stein, who worked for Stanford University's Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project; he learned from him that Spacewar was running on the laboratory's PDP-6, and played the game against him there when visiting. Soon after, he saw an ad for the Data General Nova computer, which cost only US$4,000, and thought again about his Spacewar arcade game idea; he believed that at that price, if he were able to connect four monitors and coin slots to allow multiple games to run simultaneously, the game would be economically viable. He showed his office mate and fellow Ampex engineer Ted Dabney Spacewar at the Stanford laboratory, and the two agreed to work together to try and design a prototype of the game; Bushnell was more <b>experienced</b> <b>with</b> computers and digital engineering, while Dabney was more <b>experienced</b> <b>with</b> analog and hardware engineering, as he had been working on designing video processing and control circuits and power supplies.|$|E
50|$|Channel {{expansion}} {{theory is}} a theory of communication media perceptions that incorporates experiential factors to explain and predict user perceptions of the new communication media. The theory suggests {{that in order to}} understand users' varying perceptions of any medium, we need to consider users' prior knowledge-building experiences relating to use of the same medium.Carlson and Zmud, who developed the theory in 1999, identified the following four experiences as important in shaping individuals' perception of media richness: <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> the channel, <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> the message topic, <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> the organizational context, and <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> communication partner.|$|R

40|$|In the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM), {{both the}} {{goods being valued}} and the payment {{vehicles}} used to value them are mostly hypothetical. However, although numerous {{studies have examined the}} impact of <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> the good on the willingness to pay, less attention has been given to <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> the payment vehicles. This paper examines how <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> payment vehicles influences responses to a CV scenario on the maintenance of irrigation canals. Specifically, the paper uses a split-sample survey to investigate the effects of <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> monetary and labour payment vehicles on the acceptance of a CV scenario and protest bids. Using convergent validity tests, we found that experience acquired from using both monetary and labour payment vehicles reduces the asymmetries in acceptance rates. These findings suggest that <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> payment vehicles reduces time/money response asymmetries in the CVM. contingent valuation; payment vehicles; numéraires; experience...|$|R
5|$|Several {{problems}} were <b>experienced</b> <b>with</b> the iPhone 5S's hardware after its release. The most widely reported {{issue is that}} the angle reported by the phone's level sensor had drifted by several degrees, which caused the gyroscope, compass, and accelerometer to become inaccurate. Reports suggested {{that this is a}} hardware-induced problem. Some encountered other problems such as crashing with a blue screen and then restarting, the power button making a rattling noise when the phone was shaken, overheating, the microphone not working, and Touch ID not working for iTunes purchases. Some of these issues have been fixed by software updates.|$|E
5|$|The 4th and 55th Fighter Regiments {{had most}} of the MiG-3s {{assigned}} to the Odessa Military District and their experiences {{on the first day}} of the war may be taken as typical. The 4th, an experienced unit, shot down a Romanian Bristol Blenheim reconnaissance bomber, confirmed by postwar research, and lost one aircraft which crashed into an obstacle on takeoff. The 55th was much less <b>experienced</b> <b>with</b> the MiG-3 and claimed three aircraft shot down, although recent research confirms only one German Henschel Hs 126 was 40% damaged, and suffered three pilots killed and nine aircraft lost. The most unusual case was the pair of MiG-3s dispatched from the 55th on a reconnaissance mission to Ploieşti that failed to properly calculate their fuel consumption and both were forced to land when they ran out of fuel.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} of the breech-loader was the obvious problem of sealing the breech. All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of a solid propellant into gas. This explosion propels the shot or shell {{out of the front}} of the gun, but also imposes great stresses on the gun-barrel. If the breech—which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun—is not entirely secure, then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break. This in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew. Warriors Armstrong guns suffered from both problems; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4.5in (118mm) armor of Gloire, while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing. Similar problems were <b>experienced</b> <b>with</b> the breech-loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies.|$|E

5|$|According to {{director}} Hajime Tanigawa, its gameplay {{was based}} around prevalent South Korean online role-playing games for PC. Tanigawa joined when the title shifted {{to being an}} MMORPG, and he estimated development time in this form at ten months. At the beginning of development, the team decided to release a working form of the game within a year. This was managed by narrowing {{the amount of time}} spent on the early concept work, instead taking inspiration directly from other titles, including titles within the Megami Tensei series: Tanigawa said that without this, development might have lasted up to three years. When the closed beta began, many of the game's final functions had yet to be implemented. A free-to-play model was adopted as the team wanted to bring in the maximum number of players into the game. While making the game completely free and using in-game advertising as a means of earning money was an option, this had yet to become commercially viable in Japan at the time. In early 2007, CAVE partnered with Gung Ho Online Entertainment, a Japanese company <b>experienced</b> <b>with</b> online games who could co-manage the game with CAVE. According to Tanigawa, the partnership with Gung Ho Online opened up the possibility of expansion into Asian and Western markets.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, Valve {{announced}} that the entirety of Dota 2 would be ported over to their Source 2 game engine in an update called Dota 2 Reborn, making Dota 2 the first game to use the engine. Reborn was first {{released to the public}} as a beta update that same month, and officially replaced the original client in September 2015. Reborn included a new user interface framework design, ability for custom game modes created by the community, and the full replacement of the original Source engine with Source 2. Largely attributed to technical difficulties players <b>experienced</b> <b>with</b> the update, the global player base experienced a sharp drop of approximately sixteen percent the month following the release of Reborn. However, after various updates and patches, over a million concurrent players were playing again by the beginning of 2016, with that being the largest amount of users in nearly a year. The move to Source 2 also allowed the use of the Vulkan graphics API, which was released as an optional feature in May 2016, making Dota 2 one of the first games to offer it.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to {{temporary}} flight lieutenant on 1 August 1943, McAloney {{was sent}} to the Directorate of Technical Services from November as the specialist officer on American and gas turbine jet engines. The following November, he was dispatched to Dutch New Guinea to rectify issues being <b>experienced</b> <b>with</b> Pratt & Whitney engines in operations by aircraft of the 1st Tactical Air Force. He returned to Australia and his position with Technical Services in December, and saw out the remainder of the war in this post. McAloney decided he wanted to remain in the Air Force on the cessation of hostilities, and subsequently sought a permanent commission in the post-war RAAF. Having continued on a short-service commission in the meantime, his application was ultimately approved in September 1948 and he was granted the substantive rank of flight lieutenant. His younger brother, Robert Simpson McAloney, also saw service with the RAAF in the Second World War. He had enlisted in late 1937 and rose to the rank of warrant officer before his discharge in 1946, his final posting being to No.1 Communication Unit.|$|E
