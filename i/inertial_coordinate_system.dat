It {{is an open}} {{question}} whether solutions of the Einstein-Euler equations are smooth enough to admit locally <b>inertial</b> <b>coordinates</b> at points of shock wave interaction, or whether “regularity singularities” can exist at such points. The term regularity singularity was proposed by the authors as a point in spacetime where the gravitational metric tensor is Lipschitz continuous (C 0, 1), but no smoother, in any coor-dinate system of the C 1, 1 atlas. An existence theory for shock wave solutions in C 0, 1 admitting arbitrary interactions has been proven for the Einstein-Euler equations in spherically symmetric spacetimes, but C 1, 1 is the requisite smoothness required for space-time to be locally flat.

50|$|By definition, if a {{particle}} with no forces acting on {{it has its}} position expressed in an <b>inertial</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system,</b> (x1, x2, x3, t), then there it will have no acceleration (d2xj/dt2 = 0). In this context, a coordinate system can fail to be “inertial” either due to non-straight time axis or non-straight space axes (or both). In other words, the basis vectors of the coordinates may vary in time at fixed positions, or they may vary with position at fixed times, or both. When equations of motion are {{expressed in terms of}} any non-inertial coordinate system (in this sense), extra terms appear, called Christoffel symbols. Strictly speaking, these terms represent components of the absolute acceleration (in classical mechanics), but we may also choose to continue to regard d2xj/dt2 as the acceleration (as if the coordinates were inertial) and treat the extra terms as if they were forces, in which case they are called fictitious forces.

Thus the problem of existence of regularity singularities is equivalent to the question as to whether or not these Coriolis type effects are essentially non-removable and `real', or merely coordinate effects that can be removed, (in analogy to classical Coriolis forces), by going to the less regular atlas of C^ 1, 1 transformations. If essentially non-removable, it would argue strongly for a `real' new physical effect for General Relativity, providing a physical context to the open problem of regularity singularities.

40|$|Historically, Einstein’s Special Relativity Theory (SRT) came to {{reconcile}} the Galilean principle of relativity of inertial motion with the empirical fact of constancy {{of the speed of}} light in <b>inertial</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems.</b> As a result, a classical (Galilean) coordinate transformation was replaced by the Lorentz transformation of 4 -position and 4 -momentum vectors in Minkowski space. This is the main content of SRT Kinematics, physical principles of which are clear and selfconsistent. However, in many SRT applications questions arise concerning physical interpretation of geometrical structure of Minkowski space and proper/improper quantities resulted from Lorentz transformations. Often, poor or even wrong popular presentation of SRT concepts contribute to confusions and controversies especially when a problem formulation and/or its solution requires gaining an insight into theory physical foundations and beyond. The so-called clock (twin) paradox is an example of this kind of problem, disputed over years in literature; in different publications it was ill-posed in formulation, and/or ill-treated in solutions. The paper is intended to clarify operational meaning of mass and time quantities as main characteristics of an atomic clock, which is considered a quantum oscillator in association with the de Broglie wave concept. The specification of the concept of clock in quantum terms reflects the idea of relativistic mass and time complementarity, which is important for avoiding ambiguity of such notions as “time rate”, “time record”, and “elapsed time ” under relativistic conditions. We used this approach in SRT Kinematics to conduct a detailed analysis of the clock paradox; results are discussed.
