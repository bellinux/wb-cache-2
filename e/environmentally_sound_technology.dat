This paper investigates the impacts of firms considering corporate social responsibility and <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>technology</b> by building a three-stage Cournot competition model with asymmetric cost. The sustainable development of economic and endogenous firm growth achieves the win–win result in the theoretical model. Using data from 31 firms in China, this paper empirically researches on the relationships among corporate social responsibility, <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>technology</b> and firm endogenous growth. The results show that: (1) Marginal cost decreased {{with the increase of}} innovation, as well as getting government research and development subsidy, which has a positive effect on firm growth. (2) Consumers respond positively to corporate social responsibility initiative, the reputation of the firm can be improved. At the same time, <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>technology</b> objectively reduces the marginal cost of competitors because of the technology spillover. (3) Profit of a firm undertaking corporate social responsibility partly decreases, which has a negative effect on firm growth. The contradiction between corporate social responsibility and profit of firm could be adjusted, such as socially responsible investment fund hosed by institutional investors...|$|E
40|$|One billion people, {{mostly in}} {{developing}} countries {{do not have access}} to safe drinking water and water treatment is often required due to pollution of water sources. A low cost membrane technology, the Sky Juice, can remove turbidity, bacteria and parasites from water. The objectives of the project were to verify the Sky Juice technology performance and also determine if it was a suitable <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>technology</b> in comparison to alternative disinfection methods. For verification of the Sky Juice technology, laboratory examination of clay and algae turbidity removal by three Sky Juice units as well as bacterial removal by another three Sky Juice units were conducted. Control and membrane fault tests were also performed using deionised water and the bubble point test. The <b>Environmentally</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>Technology</b> - Performance Assessment (EST-PA) was used to assess the Sky Juice, chlorine disinfection (by Calcium Hypochlorite) and SODIS technologies in detail. The EST-PA was still under development by the United Nations Environment Program. EST-PA proposed criteria and indicators were used with some suggested changes to analyse the technologies. To compare the technologies and make EST-PA operational, a rating system was incorporated. Field verification information from Laos was collected as a last stage in EST-PA to validate the technical assessment and determine if the Sky Juice was suitable and socially accepted in field conditions. The Sky Juice performance met manufacturer's claims and World Health Organisation guidelines always after five minutes of use since cleaning the membrane. Within the first five minutes, small clay particles passed through the 0. 2 μ membrane giving slightly higher turbidity readings. Four out of six Sky Juice units tested had several faulty membrane fibres. Due to these faults bacteria removal could not be confirmed in the first five minutes of use of the Sky Juice but past experience showed complete removal by intact membranes on larger systems. It is recommended that simple bubble point tests to check for faults before delivery and installation of the technology. The Sky Juice was found to be the most <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>technology</b> and suitable for low virus risk areas, whilst chlorine disinfection could be suitable but had higher environmental impacts. The SODIS technology still performed well in environmental performance but was mainly suitable for warmer and lower rainfall climates. Field verification showed that Sky Juice was socially acceptable and suitable for use in a rural village in the mountains of Laos...|$|E

The study has been performed as a questionnaire-based survey among {{a subset of the}} companies that participate in the UN Global Compact The UN Global Compact is a voluntary organisation that in the words of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan seeks to “give a human face to the global market”. In other words, the UN Global Compact is a corporate citizenship initiative that explores voluntary mobilisation of business sector for reducing human rights violations, labour rights violations, environmental degradation and corruption. This thesis {{has investigated}} one aspect of this organisation that is related to the environmental principles: what is the potential role of CSR initiatives in the diffusion of <b>Environmentally</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>Technologies.</b> The results show that companies that have a high degree of CSR involvement also have higher utilisation of <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>technologies.</b> It is believed that one manner of involving business in these issues is to present a compelling business case.

However, there has been inadequate empirical research on the nexus between foreign direct investment and the transfer of <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>technology</b> (EST), specifically focused on African countries.

My study encompasses illustrative case studies specifically related to energy firms, and the data were drawn from literature and in-depth individual interviews. The results indicate that Angola has used its national policy framework and institutions to promote inward foreign direct investment, and has harnessed appropriate international regimes to acquire ESTs. Countries may therefore invoke sovereignty principles enshrined in constitutional provisions, or may utilise international regimes to attract ESTs through foreign direct investment. I recommend that further studies be conducted to explore this subject area, drawing examples from other African countries and differing economic sectors. [URL] Science...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the linkages between foreign direct investment, informal sector and transfer of <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>technology</b> (EST) in a developing economy {{in terms of}} a three-sector, full-employment general equilibrium model with an informal sector that produces a non-traded input for the formal final good producing sector. The same input is produced by another division of the formal sector, which generates less pollution than the informal sector since the former uses a different type of capital that embodies EST. The formal sector has to pay a penalty {{in the form of a}} production tax for using the output of the excessively polluting informal sector. In this scenario, the analysis finds that foreign capital inflow in the formal sector may accentuate pollution, even if it involves transfer of EST. Secondly, there might exist a positive relationship between pollution and national income in the economy both in the presence and absence of transfer of EST. These results can at least question the desirability of transfer of EST and also give theoretical explanations behind the existence of a positively sloped segment in the Environmental Kuznets Curve. ...|$|E

Which unique 'subjective' game is actually played depends crucially on how the agents discount their future payoffs. We examine equilibrium behavior and its consequences on sustainability of the common-pool resource system under exponential and hyperbolic discounting. A suffcient degree of patience on behalf of the agents may lead to equilibrium behavior averting exhaustion of the resource, though full restraint (both agents choosing the ecologically or <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>technology)</b> is not necessarily achieved. Furthermore, if the degree of patience between agents is suffciently dissimilar, the more patient is exploited by the less patient one in equilibrium.
