5000|$|A frontal lisp {{occurs when}} the tongue is placed {{anterior}} of the target. <b>Interdental</b> <b>lisping</b> is produced when {{the tip of the}} tongue protrudes between the front teeth and dentalised lisping is produced when the tip of the tongue just touches the front teeth. The transcription in the International Phonetic Alphabet for interdental sibilants is [...] and [...] and for simple dental sibilants is [...] and [...] When a fronted lisp does not have a sibilant quality, due to placing the lack of a grooved articulation, the IPA transcription would be [...] or variants thereof.|$|E
40|$|Through a {{transversal}} epidemiological study, conducted with 333 Brazilian children, males (157) and females (176), aged 3 to 6 years old, {{enrolled in a}} public preschool, this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of {{the different types of}} vertical interincisal trespass (VIT) and the relationship between these occlusal aspects and anterior lisping and/or anterior tongue thrust in the articulation of the lingua-alveolar phonemes /t/, /d/, /n/ and /l/. All children involved were submitted to a VIT examination and to a speech evaluation. Statistical significance was analyzed through the Qui-square test, at a significance level of 0. 05 (95 % confidence limit). The quantitative analysis of the data demonstrated the following prevalences: 1 - the different types of VIT: 48. 3 % for normal overbite (NO), 22. 5 % for deep overbite (DO), 9. 3 % for edge to edge (ETE) and 19. 8 % for open bite (OB); 2 - <b>interdental</b> <b>lisping</b> in relation to the different types of VIT: 42 % for NO, 12. 5 % for DO, 12. 5 % for ETE, 32. 9 % for OB; and 3 - children with anterior tongue thrust in the articulation of lingua-alveolar phonemes in relation to the different types of VIT: 42. 1 % for NO, 14 % for DO, 10. 5 % for ETE, 33. 3 % for OB. The results demonstrated that there was a significant relationship between open bite and anterior lisping and/or anterior tongue thrust in the articulation of the lingua-alveolar phonemes /t/, /d/, /n/ and /l/; and that there was a significant relationship between deep overbite and the absence of anterior lisping and anterior tongue thrust in the articulation of the lingua-alveolar phonemes...|$|E

50|$|Tongue {{thrusting}} {{and speech}} problems may co-occur. Due to unconventional postures {{of the tongue}} and other articulators, <b>interdental</b> and frontal <b>lisping</b> are very common. The alveolar sounds /s/ and /z/ are produced more anteriorly thus leading to interdental fricative like sounds, /th/.|$|R
