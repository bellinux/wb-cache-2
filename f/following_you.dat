2500|$|The {{criticism}} {{directed at}} Levin <b>following</b> <b>You,</b> and Me and the Next War and Ketchup deepened after {{the premiere of}} his third political play, Queen of a Bathtub ("מלכת אמבטיה), produced by the Cameri Theater in April 1970. David Levin directed the controversial play, which made pointed use of vulgarity, and contained provocative sketches such as [...] "The Binding" [...] in which Isaac begs his father Abraham not to hesitate to slaughter him, and [...] "The Courting" [...] which mocks Israeli volubility and arrogance. Perhaps because it was presented {{on the stage of}} an established theater, the play aroused an unprecedented storm of public opinion. Viewers protested and made a disturbance during the performances. The National Religious Party demanded censorship of a song that, in its opinion, profaned the honor of the Bible. The government threatened to withdraw its financial support from the theater. The criticism further addressed the play itself: [...] "a combination of flawed dialogues and ditties attempting to toss salt on our open wounds" [...] (Dr. Haim Gamzu); [...] "This 'theatrash' (mahazevel) makes us all out to be despicable killers, citizens of a militarist, money-grabbing state." [...] (Uri Porat); and [...] "a scene about a reporter, who comes to interview a young widow whose husband died in the trenches, and plays at love with her, only a demonic or infirm mind could devise... it's a malicious abuse of thousands of bereaved parents" [...] (Reuven Yanai). In spite of Levin's objections, the theater's management decided, in the wake of these outraged responses, to close the show after only nineteen performances.|$|E
