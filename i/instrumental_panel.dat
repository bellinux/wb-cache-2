40|$|The {{financial}} administration control {{offers the}} managing staff {{the possibility to}} decide on the entrusted methods and means and to direct its action in order to reach the objectives that were set out according to the main interests of each company. The objectives are set down by taking into consideration both managing and operative functions. However, the desired results are obtained only after a certain period of time, during which there may occur changes of the initial context within which the objectives and action plans were drawn up. In this case the readjustment of the financial administration control within the managerial control structure becomes an essential condition for successfully reaching the established targets. A condition as such comes from the description of the desired outcome, of the indicators that will be used to assess it and the necessary means to obtain it. The objectives also have to express the agreement reached between hierarchic levels on dialogue grounds, thus ensuring the harmonization of the collective interests with those that determine the functioning of the enterprise. A very important part in this dialogue is played by the <b>instrumental</b> <b>panel</b> and also by the other devices of the financial administration control, which will have to be readjusted in a proper manner according to the changes occurred within the economic and business environment. financial administration control, managing and operative functions, performance, <b>instrumental</b> <b>panel.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new evidence}} on income inequality in Latin America {{over the period}} 1981 - 2000. Using a panel data methodology, we find that a reduction in corruption {{is associated with a}} rise in inequality. This counterintuitive result can be explained by privatisation. Privatisation removes industries from government influence (and corruption) and worsens income inequality as new owners strive for efficiency and profits. The paper argues that structural reform policies aimed primarily at achieving positive and increasing growth rates do not adequately address the income distribution problem.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the regional impacts of the National Family Farming Program (PRONAF in the Portuguese acronym) between 2000 and 2010, using the econometric <b>instrumental</b> <b>panel</b> data models with fixed effects. The approach combined impact assessments at various regional scales - local, microrregional and mesorregional. Additionally, impact assessments for each of the five Brazilian regions were separately carried out. While in the Northeast, Southeast and South regions it was possible to verify the Program's positive impacts on per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and municipal agricultural GDP growth rates, the North and Midwest regions were characterized by the absence of impacts related to the Program. The magnitude of the impacts was higher in southern and southeastern regions than in the Northeast. This demonstrates the importance of conducting a regional analysis even in nationwide policies. Finally, the impact assessments in microrregional and mesorregional levels showed results qualitatively similar to those observed at the municipal level. We conclude, therefore, there were positive impacts on GDP per capita and agricultural GDP growth rates due to PRONAF in all three analyzed scales for the Northeast, Southeast and South regions. It is noteworthy that, during the period considered for this study (2000 - 2010), these three regions concentrated 84. 4 % of the program's resources and 90. 4 % of the program's beneficiaries...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{economic}} thinking says {{corruption and}} income inequality are positively related. In contrast, this study finds that lower corruption {{is associated with}} higher income inequality. The finding of a trade-off is not unexpected {{in the context of}} Latin America, for two reasons. First, Latin America has a large informal sector and corruption-reducing polices impose a transaction cost on this sector whose members are among the poorest. Second, redistributive measures, promoted by corrupt elements in society, are often cut back with institutional reform and this serves to worsen inequality. The results imply that corruption-reducing policies aimed at lowering inequality may be misguided. corruption, Latin America, income inequality, <b>instrumental</b> variables, <b>panel</b> data. ...|$|R

It combines <b>panel</b> data with <b>instrumental</b> variables to correct for OLS biases due to reverse causality. In particular, it introduces push-targeting instruments; they constitute a new approach to find dynamic instruments based on gravity equations that are suitable to be used in panel data settings with fixed effects. Another methodological contribution is the aggregation of instruments as a solution to the lack of bilateral migration data. Results suggest a negative impact of immigration on productivity that is partially offset by a positive effect on participation and employment.

40|$|This paper re-examines {{the panel}} unit root tests {{proposed}} by Chang (2002). She establishes asymptotic {{independence of the}} t-statistics when integrable functions of lagged dependent variable are used as instruments even if the original series are cross sectionally dependent. She claims that her non-linear <b>instrumental</b> variable (NIV) <b>panel</b> unit root test is valid under general error cross correlations for any N (the cross section dimension) as T (the time dimension of the panel) tends to infinity. These results are largely due to her particular choice of the error correlation matrix which results in weak cross section dependence. Also, the asymptotic independence property of the t- statistics disappears when Chang's modified instruments are used. Using a common factor model with a sizeable degree of cross section correlations, we show that Chang's NIV panel unit root test suffers from gross size distortions, even when N is small relative to T.

The level of technical efficiency is measured using a stochastic frontier production function approach. Based on estimation results from <b>instrumental</b> variable <b>panel</b> quantile regressions we find that there is a positive significant effect of off-farm employment on the level of farm technical efficiency. We also find that fragmentation of farmland is a barrier to the improvement of technical efficiency. In addition, we find a downward trend in the level of agricultural technical efficiency among our sample. Therefore, the Chinese Government should stimulate agricultural mechanization and the development of farming techniques to improve technical efficiency in the context of increasing off-farm employment...|$|R
30|$|As an {{extension}} of the analysis, we undertake <b>instrumental</b> variables <b>panel</b> estimates. The hypothesis of no time-invariant establishment effects is rejected—see Appendix (Table 8), column BP—and the fixed effects estimator is preferred—see Appendix (Table 8), column HAUS. The productivity and investment effects of WTA are significantly positive. For the productivity function, the complete estimates with and without industry and region dummies are shown in Appendix (Table 9). In addition to the positive WTA effect, we find that labor hoarding significantly reduces productivity, while relocations and reorganizations enhance productivity. We do not find significant wage effects of WTA. Separate estimates for the output and the number of employees as a supplement to the productivity estimation show that the positive WTA effect on productivity is driven by the output and not by the number of employees (Bellmann and Hübler 2015).|$|R

In addition to the influence of current fishing rents (as measured by lease prices), we explore the effect of market interest rates, risk, and expected changes in future rents on quota asset prices. Controlling for these other factors, the results support a fairly simple relationship between quota asset and contemporaneous lease prices. Consistent with theoretical expectations, the results indicate that quota asset prices are positively related to declines in interest rates, lower levels of risk, expected increases in future fish prices, and expected cost reductions from rationalization under the quota system. However, the magnitude of some interrelationships is muted relative to what theory suggests, possibly due to measurement error. tradable permits, individual transferable fishing quota, asset pricing, fisheries, policy...|$|R

The empirical evidence is based on <b>instrumental</b> variable <b>panel</b> Fixed Effects (FE) and Tobit models {{in order to control}} for the unobserved heterogeneity and limited range in the dependent variable. The modeling exercise is based on the inequality adjusted human development (IHDI) and its constituents. The following main findings are established. First, from the FE regressions, software piracy consistently improves the IHDI and its constituents. Within this framework, the positive relationship between inclusive human development and software piracy is driven by all its constituents. Second, for Tobit regressions, the positive relationship between software piracy and inclusive human development is confirmed exclusively in the IHDI and literacy specifications. Within the latter framework, the positive relationship between software piracy and inclusive human is driven fundamentally by the literacy rate. Policy implications are discussed...|$|R
