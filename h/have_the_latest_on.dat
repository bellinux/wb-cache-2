During Concurrent Engineering sessions, an interdisciplinary team negotiates optimal configurations of the intended space system. The Space Suppliers And Manufacturers (SSAM) database was created with the goal to support engineers during the design process. The CE engineer can search through SSAM by using an interface to specify the right subsystem or component resulting in a list of companies with each listing including the company profile as well as available product sheets. The Java based system consists of seven main subsystem categories (e. g. structure, power, thermal, etc.) and 61 component categories (e. g. batteries, solar cells, reaction wheels, patch antennas, etc.). Over 200 companies are currently listed with over thousands of different products related to space industry. Long-term scope of SSAM is the active involvement of the space industry (the supplier side).

60|$|I think Mrs. Eddy {{was born}} with a far-seeing business-eye, but did not know it; and with a great {{organizing}} and executive talent, and did not know it; and with a large appetite for power and distinction, and did not know it. I think the reason that her make did not show up until middle life was that she had General Grant's luck--Circumstance and Opportunity did not come her way when she was younger. The qualities that were born in her had to wait for circumstance and opportunity--but they were there: they were there to stay, whether they ever got a chance to fructify or not. If they had come early, they would have found her ready and competent. And they--not she--would have determined what they would set her at and what they would make of her.

40|$|The Academic library {{plays an}} {{important}} role within the organisational mission of the university, since it helps in the development of its inner values and contributes to the achievement of the pedagogical and scientific plans. In the above context the reference librarianship is no longer an information provider, he becomes an assertive and pro-active part of scientific knowledge growth. In this dissertation, the intention is to examine and evaluate the intermediary role played by the health area reference librarianship. This evaluation will be done under an academic and medical perspective. The reference librarianship should <b>have</b> <b>the</b> users‟ needs at the centre of his role. He should always use the information and communication technologies available; however, the ethical part of the process cannot be forgotten. In this dissertation, the study approach used was similar to the one usually used on case studies. Our case study basis is the 250 health area teachers of Escola Superior de Tecnologia da Saúde de Lisboa. The inquiry was the method used in order to obtain the data for this research. Our case study conclusions may give some idea about the new profile of the reference librarianship of the academic context within the health area, which are as follows: 1) <b>the</b> reference librarianship <b>has</b> to co-operate with the students and teachers in the classes, in other words, they have to start working in the field instead of being „closed‟ in the academic library; 2) within the library, the reference librarianship should support the increase of information consultancy; <b>the</b> librarian should <b>have</b> <b>the</b> capacity to use his skills in order to help the user; 3) the user would prefer the librarian to assist/guide in the research process rather than using the librarian‟s skills to provide the research material; 4) the user should be aware that a fee may be payable if he requires an urgent and quality research service which is/can be provided by a skilled professional (reference librarianship); 5) the reference librarianship can be helpful in the field, when working with a health care team (hospital) based on their access and capacity to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> news <b>on</b> health research discoveries and being able to resolve medical doubts due to their capacity to deal with problem-based learning...|$|R

Prominence was given to stress biology and the importance of poplar and willow breeding in meeting the needs of ecological restoration. The aim of this review is provide a timely account of the questions related to phytotechnology in shaping the multifunctional tree, particularly with regard to tree responses to environmental pollution. While the question is scientifically challenging, progress may be achieved by exposing the different environmental restoration models and underlying guiding principles to tests against experimental data and each other. Research and development should focus simultaneously on maximizing the yield of multipurpose tree plantations, while preserving or restoring ecosystem services of close-to-nature willow-poplar stands (e. g., riparian forests). We hope that this review will stimulate further studies in this interesting area of tree biology...|$|R
40|$|Sleep {{habits of}} Portuguese {{undergraduates}} are almost unknown, {{and very few}} international published articles have addressed whether demographic and academic variables such as residence, university year and academic field, might be associated to the sleep-wake patterns of university students. The aims of the present work were thus to characterize perceived sleep habits, behaviours and problems of Portuguese undergraduates, and to examine them by gender, residence status, university year and academic field. The selected participants were 1654 undergraduates (55 % female) of a public Portuguese university, aged 17 - 25 years (M = 19. 98, SD = 1. 65), at the 1 st, 2 nd a 3 rd university years, studying Engineering, Management, Sciences, Languages and Education, in its majority living outside their parents/family home (students). Participants answered to a self-response questionnaire about sleep-wake patterns, developed for the main research. Compared to men, women showed more regular and earlier sleep-wake schedules, fewer sleeplessness nights, and less napping, but more troubles initiating/maintaining sleep and use of pills to fall asleep. students <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> sleep-wake schedules <b>on</b> week nights, and felt more disturbed by noise; men reported more sleeplessness nights to complete academic tasks and greater changes of sleep habits since high school. Across university years (1 st- 3 rd), there was a rising of perceived change of sleep habits, a delay of bedtime on school nights, and a decrease, in men, of week-weekend irregularity of rise time and of sleeplessness nights. Engineering students <b>had</b> <b>the</b> fewest difficulties initiating/maintaining sleep and the lowest use of sleeping promoting pills but, together with Sciences and Management, later sleep-wake schedules, than Languages and Education students. Differences on sleep-wake patterns were found between men and women, in accordance to the sleep literature. On addition to gender, the present study highlights that university year and, most importantly, residence circumstances, are also important variables {{to be considered for}} a better understanding of sleep habits and behaviours in undergraduates. Thus, we hope our findings constitute a contribution for the improvement of health prevention and intervention strategies directed to university students.

6000|$|... "My other novel," [...] Hewet continued, [...] "is about a {{young man}} who is obsessed by an idea--the idea of being a gentleman. He manages to exist at Cambridge on a hundred pounds a year. He has a coat; it was once a very good coat. But the trousers--they're not so good. Well, he goes up to London, gets into good society, owing to an early-morning {{adventure}} {{on the banks of the}} Serpentine. He is led into telling lies--my idea, you see, is to show the gradual corruption of the soul--calls himself the son of some great landed proprietor in Devonshire. Meanwhile the coat becomes older and older, and he hardly dares to wear the trousers. Can't you imagine the wretched man, after some splendid evening of debauchery, contemplating these garments--hanging them over the end of the bed, arranging them now in full light, now in shade, and wondering whether they will survive him, or he will survive them? Thoughts of suicide cross his mind. He has a friend, too, a man who somehow subsists upon selling small birds, for which he sets traps in the fields near Uxbridge. They're scholars, both of them. I know one or two wretched starving creatures like that who quote Aristotle at you over a fried herring and a pint of porter. Fashionable life, too, I have to represent at some length, in order to show my hero under all circumstances. Lady Theo Bingham Bingley, whose bay mare he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> good fortune to stop, is the daughter of a very fine old Tory peer. I'm going to describe the kind of parties I once went to--the fashionable intellectuals, you know, who like to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> book <b>on</b> their tables. They give parties, river parties, parties where you play games. There's no difficulty in conceiving incidents; the difficulty is to put them into shape--not to get run away with, as Lady Theo was. It ended disastrously for her, poor woman, for the book, as I planned it, was going to end in profound and sordid respectability. Disowned by her father, she marries my hero, and they live in a snug little villa outside Croydon, in which town he is set up as a house agent. He never succeeds in becoming a real gentleman after all. That's the interesting part of it. Does it seem to you the kind of book you'd like to read?" [...] he enquired; [...] "or perhaps you'd like my Stuart tragedy better," [...] he continued, without waiting for her to answer him. [...] "My idea is that there's a certain quality of beauty in the past, which the ordinary historical novelist completely ruins by his absurd conventions. The moon becomes the Regent of the Skies. People clap spurs to their horses, and so on. I'm going to treat people as though they were exactly the same as we are. The advantage is that, detached from modern conditions, one can make them more intense and more abstract then people who live as we do." ...|$|R

5000|$|The modding {{scene of}} the Nintendo 3DS {{involves}} both flash cartridges which emulate an original game cart (which can be solely used to play untouched game cart ROM backups) and custom firmware (software which patches the official firmware [...] "on the fly"), which requires an exploit to obtain control of the ARM9, the 3DS' security coprocessor. The current most widely used CFW is Luma3DS, developed by Aurora Wright and TuxSH, which allows unsigned CIA (CTR Importable Archives) files to be installed on the Nintendo 3DS devices, provides region-free features, exception handling for homebrew software developers etc.. Other past and abandoned CFWs included Gateway (a proprietary CFW locked to a flash cartridge via DRM and the first publicly available one), Pasta, RxTools (the first free and widely used one) and Corbenik; still developed CFWs are ReiNAND, on which Luma3DS (previously known as AuReiNAND) was originally based, Cakes CFW (the first open source CFW, which used a modularized approach for patches and was {{the inspiration for the}} following ones). 3DS CFWs used to rely on [...] "EmuNAND"/"RedNAND", a feature that boots the system from an unpartitioned space of the SD card containing a copy of the 3DS' NAND memory. These EmuNANDs could protect the 3DS system from bricking, as the usual system NAND was unaffected if the emuNAND is no longer functioned properly or was otherwise unusable. EmuNANDs could also be updated separately from the usual system NAND, allowing users to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> system version <b>on</b> <b>the</b> EmuNAND while retaining the vulnerable version on the system NAND; thus making online play and Nintendo eShop access possible on outdated 3DS system versions.EmuNANDs were obsoleted by the release of arm9loaderhax, a boot-time ARM9 exploit that allowed people to safely use SysNAND and update it, as CFWs started patching the OS' update code so that official updates wouldn't remove the exploit. However, this exploit required a downgrade to a very early system version to get the console's unique OTP, necessary for the installation.On May 19, 2017 a new exploit called boot9strap was released, replacing arm9loaderhax and allowing users to get even earlier control of the system, granting code execution {{in the context of the}} bootROM and thus a cleaner environment, with no downgrades or OTP required.At the same time, another bootROM exploit was announced, which allows people to use a backdoor present in the bootROM to get full system control on any 3DS console regardless of the firmware version (as the bootROM can't be updated), only requiring a modified DS flash cartridge and a magnet. A list of compatible DS flash cartridges and <b>the</b> required software <b>have</b> yet to be released.|$|R
