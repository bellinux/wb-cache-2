40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Thesis (M. S.) : Bilkent University, Department of Industrial Engineering, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2017. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 56 - 60). We study an energy imbalance {{problem in a}} <b>day</b> <b>ahead</b> electricity market {{from the perspective of}} a distribution company. This company commits to buy a certain amount of electricity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>ahead</b> market <b>the</b> <b>day</b> before <b>the</b> actual demand of its customers is realized and faces energy imbalance due to demand uncertainty. This energy imbalance of the distribution company is penalized by a mechanism which includes penalty parameters de ned by energy market regulatory authorities. By developing a variant of the newsvendor model, we nd the optimal commitment amount of the distribution company and analyze the e ect of penalty parameters on this amount. We show that the way that penalty parameters are selected in current practice may lead the distribution company to underbid. With an empirical analysis performed on real data, we also show that e ect of these penalty parameters could di er hourly, daily, seasonally, regionally and according to sectoral demand pro les. Considering that the traditional policy used to decide on the penalty parameters does not have a systematic approach, in this paper, we present insights for distribution companies on the optimal commitment decision as well as for the energy market regulatory authorities on how to choose the penalty parameters.

30|$|The {{introduction}} of competitive electricity markets {{over the last}} decades, has brought back the interest on CHP operation modeling. The new objective has been the maximization of profits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> electricity markets. <b>In</b> [8], for example, an algorithm is suggested to solve the optimal hourly CHP operation {{as a function of}} the electricity price and in [9] a deterministic model is suggested to minimize the CHP operation costs when selling the power to <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>ahead</b> market. <b>In</b> [10] both <b>day</b> <b>ahead</b> and balancing markets are considered for a portfolio of CHP and wind power while in [11] a framework for trading CHP generation in <b>day</b> <b>ahead,</b> intraday and reserves markets is proposed. Furthermore, new modeling techniques that help make optimal decisions under uncertainty have found application <b>in</b> <b>the</b> operation scheduling of power systems in general, and in DH systems in particular. For example, dynamic stochastic programming is used in [12] to determine the optimal bidding strategy of a CHP operator in various electricity markets and robust optimization in [13] to optimally schedule the operation of CHP units <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>ahead</b> market. <b>In</b> [14] stochastic programming is used to estimate the value of the electric boilers and heat pumps in a DH system as it is done also in [15], while in [16] a multi-objective chance constrained model is proposed to minimize the CHP operation costs, the total amount of primary energy consumption and the CO_ 2 emissions. Stochastic programming is also used in [17] where a multi-stage medium-term model for CHP operation is suggested considering some risk measure. [18, 19] provide a deep review of the models and techniques that have been used so far for CHP and DH operation scheduling.|$|R

An energy market without a market for transmission services is incomplete and hence inefficient. The nodal and flow-gate models complete the market when one does not consider contingencies. One can define a notion of transmission capacity (called an extended flowgate) by aggregating line capacities using spot prices. This transmission capacity completes the market and reduces the number of necessary flowgates (possibly to one). But these extended flowgates have variable capacities. As <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of the nodal model, extended flowgates can accommodate contingencies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forward market. ...|$|R
