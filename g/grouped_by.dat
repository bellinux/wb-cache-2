40|$|A {{number of}} leading {{theories}} (e. g., Grossberg & Mingolla, 1985; Kellman & Shipley, 1991; Rensink & Enns, 1995) commonly assume that perceptual <b>grouping</b> <b>by</b> contour alignment occurs preattentively across reversing contrast polarity elements. We examined this notion in seven visual search experiments. We {{found that only}} <b>grouping</b> <b>by</b> attachment supported preattentive visual search and that <b>grouping</b> <b>by</b> contour alignment required attention in order to operate. Both attachment <b>grouping</b> and <b>grouping</b> <b>by</b> contour alignment were sensitive to contrast reversals. Further results showed that contour alignment was a strong grouping cue only among elements with the same contrast sign but {{that it did not}} facilitate grouping across reversing contrast. These results suggest that <b>grouping</b> <b>by</b> contour alignment operates only on inputs of consistent contrast polarity. © 2009 The Psychonomic Society, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Administration and {{religion}} were closely linked {{in the system}} of the Celestial Masters. Adherents were <b>grouped</b> <b>by</b> families, and each was attached to a district. Families and districts, and the gods all held copies of civil registers. The registers were detailed records of the people, and recorded each person's rank, identity and location. Any changes to those registered had to be accompanied by a monetary contribution known as a 'wage of faith.' Requests to the gods followed a bureaucratic model, and were drawn up according to specific administrative codes. The effectiveness of these requests depended upon the accuracy of the registers kept by the gods.|$|E

Some ukukus traditionally spent the night on the glacier to combat spirits. They also cut and bring back blocks of the ice, which {{is believed to have}} sacred medicinal qualities. The ukukus are considered to be the only ones capable of dealing with condenados, the cursed souls said to inhabit the snowfields. According to oral traditions, ukukus from different moieties used to engage in ritual battles on the glaciers, but this practice was banned by the Catholic Church. After a mass celebrated later this day, most pilgrims leave the sanctuary. One group carries the Lord of Quyllurit'i in procession to Tayankani before taking it back to Mawallani.|$|E

The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 cemented the status of Singapore as a British possession, carving up the Malay archipelago between the two colonial powers with the area north of the Straits of Malacca, including Singapore, falling under Britain's sphere of influence. In 1826, Singapore was <b>grouped</b> <b>by</b> the British East India Company together with Penang and Malacca to form the Straits Settlements, administered by the British East India Company.

40|$|E. I. Gordon ∗ It {{is known}} that locally compact <b>groups</b> approximable <b>by</b> finite ones are unimodular, but this {{condition}} is not sufficient, for example, the simple Lie groups are not approximable by finite ones as topological groups. In this paper the approximations of locally compact <b>groups</b> <b>by</b> more general finite algebraic systems are investigated. It is proved that the approximation of locally compact <b>groups</b> <b>by</b> finite semigroups is equivalent to approximation <b>by</b> finite <b>groups</b> and thus not all locally compact <b>groups</b> are approximable <b>by</b> finite semigroups. We prove that any locally compact <b>group</b> is approximable <b>by</b> finite left (right) quasigroups but the approximabilty of a locally compact <b>group</b> <b>by</b> finite quasigroups (latin squares) implies its unimodularity. The question if the unimodularity of a locally compact group implies its approximability by finite quasigroups is open.
