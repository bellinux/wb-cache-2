40|$|Enhancements to the BIS <b>debt</b> {{securities}} <b>statistics</b> 1 The BIS has revised its <b>debt</b> securities <b>statistics</b> {{to enhance}} their comparability across different markets. International issues have been redefined as debt securities issued outside the market where the borrower resides, and statistics combining international and domestic issues are being released for the first time. The revised statistics highlight the growing size and internationalisation of bond markets. JEL classification: F 34, G 15. The internationalisation of bond markets has made {{it increasingly difficult to}} distinguish between international and domestic debt securities. The BIS has thus revised its methodology for classifying international issues, focusing now on the market of issue instead of the targeted investor base. In addition, the BIS has harmonised classifications with those in the Handbook on Securities Statistics and released for the first time data on total debt securities. This special feature outlines the reasons for these changes and discusses their impact on the statistics. Conceptual challenges The BIS has since the mid- 1980 s published statistics on borrowing activity in debt capital markets. Coverage has improved steadily over the years, expanding from the initial focus on international markets to cover more than 50 domestic markets as well. At the same time, changes in financial markets have challenged the usefulness of the statistics for financial stability analysis. 2 In particular, the growing size and diversity of debt securities markets have heightened the importance of comparable data across markets. Furthermore, the growing openness of local markets to foreign investors and issuers has blurred the distinction between international and domestic debt securities...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{two approaches}} to modeling {{the use of}} IMF resources in order to gauge whether the recent decline in credit outstanding is a temporary or a permanent phenomenon. The two approaches-the time series behavior of credit outstanding and a two-stage program selection and access model-yield the same conclusion: the use of IMF resources is likely to decline sharply. Specifically, credit outstanding is projected to decline {{from an average of}} SDR 50 billion over 2000 ? 05 to SDR 8 billion over 2006 ? 10. Stochastic simulations suggest that it is unlikely to be much higher. These results are based on WEO projections with a correction for historically-observed over-optimistic biases.

40|$|This paper aims at clarifying, {{with the}} help of a simple formal model and {{numerical}} examples, several aspects of the relationship between international investment position (IIP) and balance of payments (BOP) statistics. Exact and approximated relations are compared to analyze the estimation accuracy of the most popular data model used to reconcile BOP transaction statistics with IIP and external <b>debt</b> stock <b>statistics,</b> and discuss (a) how such accuracy is affected by volatile asset prices and transactions and (b) how net errors and omissions are related to the model in question. Numerical examples based on equity prices and exchange rates actually observed in the 1990 s suggest that the bias might have been especially large for estimates based on less detailed financial information. Serious consideration should be therefore given by national compilers to make use of more detailed financial information in compiling BOP and IIP statistics.
