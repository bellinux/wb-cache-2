5|$|On December18, 1998, the United Nations {{launched}} a large-scale rehabilitation effort in Cuba. Roughly $14million {{was spent on}} housing and infrastructure reconstruction and repair; {{this portion of the}} project consisted of reconstruction of homes, schools, businesses, hospitals, irrigation and the water system. Another $1.1million was used to inform and protect residents against post-storm diseases. The largest part of the effort involved <b>jump-starting</b> agriculture and fisheries. Roughly $50.4million was provided to reconstruct fishing vessels, purchase new tools and gear. By mid-February 1999, the Governments of Italy, Germany, Canada and the European Union provided $1million, $714,000, $50,000, and $510,200 in funds respectively. The Government of Israel also supplied agricultural tools. The Government of Norway provided $29,100 in water-borne disease prevention funds. Through various agencies, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs provided Cuba with roughly $86million in disaster funding.|$|E
5|$|President James A. Garfield died {{four days}} before they arrived back in the United States, and Kalākaua paid a {{courtesy}} call to newly inaugurated President Chester A. Arthur at the White House in Washington, D.C. There were no public or private appearances for the King in New York, only a day at Coney Island. Before leaving the eastern US, the King met with Thomas Edison to have a demonstration of electric lights, and visited Virginia's Fort Monroe. He toured Hampton Normal and Agricultural School, and shopped for horses in Kentucky. The royal party boarded a train to California, where they were house guests of Claus Spreckels at his estate in Aptos (near Santa Cruz), and had {{a few days of}} seeing the sights in the area before sailing back to Hawaii. Kalākaua was successful in <b>jump-starting</b> new immigration, with the first transplants arriving in Hawaii less than a year later. In the years that followed, he began emulating the lifestyles of European royalty with expensive furnishings in Iolani Palace, a public coronation of himself, and a two-week public celebration of his birthday.|$|E

25|$|Fulci and screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti {{share many}} screen credits from 1977 to 1983. Indeed, most of Fulci's most celebrated horror films {{were written by}} Sacchetti. After collaborating with Sacchetti for six years, Fulci went off on his own in 1983 to direct Conquest in Mexico, failing to involve Sacchetti in the deal. The film was {{supposed}} to be a high budget production, and Sacchetti allegedly resented the fact that Fulci had not thought to involve him in the project. The film actually wound up doing quite poorly upon its release, and afterwards, Fulci had trouble <b>jump-starting</b> his working relationship with Sacchetti, who by this time had gone his own way.|$|E
500|$|Darabont {{described}} {{the process of}} developing the series and setting it up at a network as [...] "four years of frustration". He first initiated a deal with NBC to own copyrights to The Walking Dead, but was later declined. [...] "They were very excited about the idea of doing a zombie show until I handed them a zombie script where zombies were actually doing zombie shit," [...] he stated. Darabont credited Hurd with finally getting the series on AMC. [...] "Gale was tremendously instrumental in <b>jump-starting</b> it at a point where it felt like it was languishing, [...] "he asserted. [...] "I'd gotten turned down enough times, which is no reflection on the material, but no matter what you're trying to sell in Hollywood, you're Willy Loman and it's Death of a Salesman. You're out there trying to sell shit that nobody wants. Even if it's good shit." ...|$|E
500|$|Suavemente is {{considered}} to have revolutionized merengue music, making it a popular subgenre of Latin music, and the album brought Crespo international recognition in the merengue market. The singer is the first merengue artist with an album atop the US Top Latin Albums chart, and two number-one songs on the US Hot Latin Songs chart. Billboard cited Crespo and American singer-actor Carlos Ponce as <b>jump-starting</b> the US market with their albums. According to Billboard Karl Ross, Crespo transcended the US Latino market and his success may have been felt in Europe and the Pacific Rim. Sony Discos president Oscar Llord called Suavemente the [...] "most successful debut album of a Tropical artist in history." [...] Suavemente was listed as the third best-charting and -selling Sony Discos album during the Top Latin Albums twenty-fifth year in 1999. Crespo was ranked fifth on the Hot Latin Songwriters in 1998, eleventh on the Top Latin Albums Artists, seventh on the Hot Latin Tracks Artists, fourth on the Top Tropical Album Artists, and second on the Tropical Tracks Artists lists. Suavemente has been {{named one of the}} most essential Latin albums of the past 50 years by Billboard, and its title song became a staple in Latin-music nightclubs. The lead single also became a popular tune in Mexico, where it was used in festivals around the country.|$|E

2500|$|... 1972 {{is seen as}} {{a pivotal}} year for Christian music festivals due to a crusade and evangelism {{training}} event called Explo '72, held in Dallas, Texas. Explo was sponsored by the World Conference on Missions and Campus Crusade for Christ. The week-long event was attended by 80,000 registered attendees and concluded with a day-long music festival. The attendance of the final event was reported by Life magazine at 150,000 and was characteristic by Billy Graham as a [...] "religious Woodstock." [...] The Explo '72 roster contained artists in a variety of genres including performers Larry Norman, Love Song, Andrae Crouch, and Johnny Cash. Explo '72 was a watershed event for the fledgling Jesus Music genre, and was the most visible event of the Jesus People movement. It is also the largest Christian music festival ever recorded; some critics even credit Explo with <b>jump-starting</b> the Christian music industry.|$|E
2500|$|Separately, Bruce Lambrecht and Rich Pogin reframed the {{discussion}} of their site with a proposal to create [...] "Twinsville" [...] as a neighborhood anchored by the new Twins ballpark. Concept drawings showed apartment buildings, commercial buildings and townhouses flanking the ballpark {{to the north and}} south, all clustered around a newly daylighted Bassett Creek (which runs in a deep culvert beneath the land). In a nod to Pawlenty's football focus, one provocative drawing included a football stadium to the west (on the current HERC site), sharing a retractable roof with the baseball facility. But this concept also hinted at the possibility that the land might have more valuable uses than as a home for the Twins, an idea which would play a significant role later. Nevertheless, their reframing succeeded in <b>jump-starting</b> interest in the project as plans began to form for bringing about action during the forthcoming 2004 legislative session.|$|E

2500|$|In Mosul, a city {{of nearly}} two million people, Petraeus and the 101st {{employed}} classic counterinsurgency methods to build security and stability, including conducting targeted kinetic operations and using force judiciously, <b>jump-starting</b> the economy, building local security forces, staging elections for the city council within weeks of their arrival, overseeing a program of public works, reinvigorating the political process, and launching 4,500 reconstruction projects in Iraq. This approach {{can be attributed to}} Petraeus, who had been steeped in nation-building during his previous tours in nations such as Bosnia and Haiti and thus approached nation-building as a central military mission and who was [...] "prepared to act while the civilian authority in Baghdad was still getting organized", according to Michael Gordon of The New York Times. Some Iraqis gave Petraeus the nickname 'King David', which was later adopted by some of his colleagues. In 2004, Newsweek stated that [...] "It's widely accepted that no force worked harder to win Iraqi hearts and minds than the 101st Airborne Division led by Petraeus." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Western Pennsylvania Hospital at Pittsburgh {{ended its}} first year of {{operation}} in 1853, and {{it was evident that}} there were a greater number of patients in jails and almshouses than could be provided for in the 26 beds designated for that express purpose at the hospital. Managers of the hospital used a $10,000 appropriation from the state to purchase a large amount of farmland on a hill overlooking the Ohio River to the north of Pittsburgh in what is now suburban Kilbuck. Planners originally wanted to build the institution in the city, but this idea was rejected by Dorothea Dix. Construction began in 1859, and opened in 1862. A grand ceremony took place on July 19, 1859 where the cornerstone of the Dixmont Kirkbride building was laid in the foundation. A glass jar was placed in the cornerstone containing numerous objects, papers, and a letter from Dorothea Dix herself. Also contained was a copy of her 1845 [...] "Memorial", the 55-page county by county study of the conditions for the mentally ill in Pennsylvania, which had a great part in <b>jump-starting</b> early mental health care reform in Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, when the time capsule was recovered prior to demolition, the jar had broken and many of the contents were in poor condition. [...] The original patient population of the hospital was a meager 113 patients who were transferred from the Western Pennsylvania Hospital in Pittsburgh. Before the 1800s were out, somewhere between 1,200 and 1,500 patients called the hospital home. In 1907, the facility was individually incorporated as the Dixmont Hospital for the Insane after separating from the Western Pennsylvania Hospital system. Dixmont was completely self-sustained from the beginning. It had its own farmlands, livestock, rail station, and post office. Also part of the facility was a water treatment plant, a sewage treatment plant, and electricity generating facilities. They had their own butchers, bakers, farmhands, electricians, laborers, pipe fitters, botanists, chefs, and even a barber and a dentist.|$|E
