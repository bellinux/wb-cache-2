5000|$|Nazi {{officials}} {{estimated that}} in February 1945 ten million refugees {{were on the}} move to escape the Russian advance. According to historians Hahn and Hahn humanitarian considerations did not {{play a role in}} Nazi evacuation planning, the Nazis considered the evacuation of the entire population as not feasible and that it was better that the population remain in territory occupied by the Soviets. By most current accounts drawing on research carried out in Poland, up {{until the end of the}} war 7,494,000 persons were evacuated from post-war Polish territory to the centre of Germany including 3,218,000 from Silesia, 2,053,000 from East Prussia, 1,081,000 from <b>East</b> <b>Pomerania,</b> 330,000 from East Brandenburg, and 812,000 from General Government. Among them, were 2,000,000 Germans who had been evacuated to, or had been resettled during the war into occupied Poland, and who took up homes of Poles subjected to ethnic cleansing operations in the preceding years. Before the end of war the number of Germans who evacuated from Czechoslovakia is estimated at 150,000 to 370,000; from Hungary 50,000-60,000; from Romania 100,000; from Yugoslavia 200,000-300,000 and from the USSR 324,000. According to sources, the total number ranged from 10 to 15 million persons. Many of those who were evacuated during the war returned to their homes in the east after May 1945; only to be transferred back to Germany in the following years. The West German Schieder commission estimated based on German ration card data from February/March 1944 that the total civilian German population (des deutschen Bevölkerungsstandes) east of the Oder-Neisse line was 11,924,000 at the end of 1944. Including 9,758,000 in pre-war German territory; 134,000 in Memel [...] 404,000 in Danzig and 1,602,000 on occupied Polish territory. According to Schieders calculations included in the total civilian population are 825,000 [...] persons evacuated eastwards to avoid Allied air raids and 1,174,000 Reichsdeutsche and re-settlers from other European nations. Schieder estimated that out of the 11.9 million population in late 1944 east of the Oder-Neisse line at the end of the war 4.4 million remained on Polish territory. More recent research in Poland puts the Germans in the fall of 1944 on the current Polish territory at 12,339,400 including 8,885,400 on pre-war German territory and Danzig; 670,000 in occupied Polish territory; 900,000 re-settlers from other European nations; 750,000 German occupation administrators and 1,134,000 persons evacuated eastwards to avoid Allied air raids [...] According to Rudiger Overmans the West German search service was able to confirm the deaths of 93,283 civilians due to the wartime flight and evacuations including 86,860 from the territory of present-day Poland and the Russian Kaliningrad region. According to the German Federal Archives 100,000 to 120,000 civilians were killed during the wartime flight and evacuation from the territory east of the Oder Neisse line.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a historic-geographical {{analysis}} of the segetal flora of <b>East</b> <b>Pomerania</b> on the basis of floristic materials collected in the years 1972 - 1979.

The frequency of occurrence of different taxa in the respective groups, depending on the specificity of a mesoregion, and the menace to crops from the particular weed species in the study period are also analysed. This paper also indicates which species are rare within the whole mesoregion considered, or which are likely to become a threat to crops in the near future...|$|E

Of the 4 graves recorded on the site the first has been totally destroyed by building operations. Finds from another grave, also revealed during building works, have found their way to the Expedition and proved to represent forms rarely encountered in this part of Pomerania, and typical of the so-called Wielka Wieś phase of Hallstatt С. Excavations conducted in the region of the first two graves have yielded another two burials: no 3, well preserved and no 4, damaged. Pottery from the graves is typical of Hallstatt С. On the other hand, undisturbed grave no 3 was unique in from. Its bottom and the walls of the burial chamber were built of field stones, while the vessels put inside the chamber were covered with a loose stone pavement. This grave is closest in form to the so-called stone-set graves. The site is an important addition to archaeological sources in the Leśno microregion and in the whole southern part of <b>East</b> <b>Pomerania.</b> Zadanie pt. „Digitalizacja i udostępnienie w Cyfrowym Repozytorium Uniwersytetu Łódzkiego kolekcji czasopism naukowych wydawanych przez Uniwersytet Łódzki” nr 885 /P-DUN/ 2014 dofinansowane zostało ze środków MNiSW w ramach działalności upowszechniającej naukę...|$|E
