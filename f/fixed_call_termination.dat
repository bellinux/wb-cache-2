40|$|Termination of a {{telephone}} call can only be realized by the network operator of the receiving party. For this reason, the markets for <b>fixed</b> and mobile <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> are regulated ex-ante including price control. To determine the costs of <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> the current regulatory regime considers only {{those parts of the}} network where customers compete for jointly used resources (mainly bandwidth). Therefore, the critical border is the "demarcation point" between the end customer dedicated access network and the aggregation network where customers compete for bandwidth. In addition to the extent of the overall network cost to be considered (depending on the location of the demarcation point) the traffic share of the voice termination service (which determines how much of the relevant cost is borne by voice termination) compared to all the other services sharing the same NGN/ NGA network needs to be taken into account. We analyse the cost effects with a cost model, which considers the part of the access network from the MPoP to the demarcation point, where the dedicated (access) network begins, in detail. This allows us to compare the impact of different demarcation points and service scenarios on the level of voice termination rates for three NGA architectures (FTTH/P 2 P, FTTH/PON and FTTC). We considered double and triple play service packages and ran sensitivities on data usage. In addition, we calculated termination cost for three different demarcation point locations in the case of FTTH/PON.

40|$|Telecommunications and ICT {{sector in}} general {{is one of the}} most rapidly growing sectors in the world. The state and level of the {{technological}} development of ICT infrastructure plays a very important and critical role in the growth and development of contemporary economies. Countries who do not have the required level and technology of ICT infrastructure are struggling to keep pace with the rapidly changing market economies and thus have difficulty in maintaining their competitive edge in the global market. In this paper, we examined whether network operators in Fiji’s Telecommunications market held SMP and thus have been abusing their market power to the detriment of the economy.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{concerns}} about the degree of competition {{in the provision of}} telecommunications <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> services have emerged. While the general consensus is that call origination {{is becoming more and more}} competitive, regulatory attention to <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> has widened in scope beyond the incumbent public telephone operators, leading to direct regulation of mobile termination charges in some countries and a debate on whether regulation should also be extended to "non-dominant" networks.

30|$|Finally, it is {{important}} to mention that the methodology proposed in this section to derive the forced <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> probability turns mathematically intractable when non-exponential distributions for the UST are considered. Nonetheless, when phase-type probability distributions are considered to model the UST, the <b>call</b> forced <b>termination</b> probability can be calculated as the ratio of the rate of forced <b>termination</b> <b>calls</b> and the rate of accepted calls as it is done in [9]. However, in this case, it is necessary to calculate a quantity which is closely related to the steady-state probabilities (as in [9, 11]) and no closed analytical expressions can be obtained. For the sake of clarity and completeness, an alternative mathematical expression for the forced <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> probability (computed as the ratio of the rate of forced <b>termination</b> <b>calls</b> and the rate of accepted calls) is presented in the next section, considering both UST and CDT exponentially distributed.|$|R

40|$|With {{the use of}} picocells to {{meet the}} {{increased}} demand of traffic density, the mobile communication networks need to comply with greater number of call handover requests than the normal cells. As the probability of handover requests is directly proportional to the mobile velocity, the handover response should be made dependent on mobile velocity to avoid unwanted <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> and early handover for high and low velocity vehicles respectively. Due to the dependency of handover performance to path loss exponent, a variable hysteresis scheme has already been proposed. As the handover performance is highly dependent on user velocity, if the hysteresis margin is made adaptive and varied dynamically in a complimentary manner with mobile velocity, the <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> as well as unnecessary handover may be minimized for high and low velocity mobiles respectively. In this work, a variable hysteresis margin based handover scheme is thus proposed and studied which takes care of both path loss exponent and mobile velocity. For different values of path loss exponent the positions of handover requests have been found out for different mobile velocities. Results show that handover delay decreases proportionately as user velocity increases, thus eliminating <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> or <b>call</b> quality degradation probability for high velocity mobiles and early handover for low velocity mobiles...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that quality of service {{requirements}} are not very strict for all traffic types, more calls of higher priority can be accommodated by reducing some bandwidth allocation for the bandwidth adaptive calls. The bandwidth adaptation to accept a higher priority call is more than that of a lower priority call. Therefore, the multi-level bandwidth adaptation technique improves the overall forced <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> probability as well as provides priority of the traffic classes in terms of call blocking probability without reducing the bandwidth utilization. We propose a novel bandwidth adaptation model that releases multi-level of bandwidth from the existing multimedia traffic calls. The amount of released bandwidth is decided based on the priority of the requesting traffic calls and the number of existing bandwidth adaptive calls. This prioritization of traffic classes does not reduce the bandwidth utilization. Moreover, our scheme reduces the overall forced <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> probability significantly. The proposed scheme is modeled using the Markov Chain. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme is able to provide negligible handover call dropping probability as well as significantly reduced new call blocking probability of higher priority calls without increasing the overall forced <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> probability.

The European Commission’s electronic communications regime allows national regulatory authorities to regulate mobile termination rates if an operator is found to possess “significant market power”. This requires that the mobile operator not be constrained by the "countervailing buyer power" of incumbents. The claim that incumbent operators possess countervailing buyer power has been repeatedly dismissed because of their obligation to interconnect with other networks. This conclusion is erroneous.

40|$|Good quality video {{services}} always require higher bandwidth. Hence, {{to provide}} the video services e. g., multicast/broadcast services (MBS) and unicast services along with the existing voice, internet, and other background traffic services over the wireless cellular networks, it is required to efficiently manage the wireless resources {{in order to reduce}} the overall forced <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> probability, to maximize the overall service quality, and to maximize the revenue. Fixed bandwidth allocation for the MBS sessions either reduces the quality of the MBS videos and bandwidth utilization or increases the overall forced <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> probability and of course the handover call dropping probability as well. Scalable Video Coding (SVC) technique allows the variable bit rate allocation for the video services. In this paper, we propose a bandwidth allocation scheme that efficiently allocates bandwidth among the MBS sessions and the non-MBS traffic calls (e. g., voice, unicast, internet, and other background traffic). The proposed scheme reduces the bandwidth allocation for the MBS sessions during the congested traffic condition only to accommodate more calls in the system. Instead of allocating fixed bandwidths for the BMS sessions and the non-MBS traffic, our scheme allocates variable bandwidths for them. However, the minimum quality of the videos is guaranteed by allocating minimum bandwidth for them. Using the mathematical and numerical analyses, we show that the proposed scheme maximizes the bandwidth utilization and significantly reduces the overall forced <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> probability as well as the handover call dropping probability...|$|R
30|$|This {{behavior}} {{is due to}} the following two facts. First, the handoff arrival rate increases as the user mobility increases in detrimental of <b>call</b> forced <b>termination</b> probability. Thus, in order to achieve the required forced <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> probability (i.e., 0.2 %), as the user mobility increases, more channels to prioritize intra- and inter-cell handoff call attempts over new call requests need to be reserved in detrimental of new call blocking probability. Consequently, in order to achieve the required new call blocking probability (i.e., 2 %), system Erlang capacity is sacrificed (mobility/capacity conversion [41]). Second, increasing the relative service time implies that the mean value of the secondary service time relative to the mean value of the primary service time increases. In this sense, as the relative service time increases (while the utilization factor of the primary channels remains unchanged), {{it is more likely that}} an ongoing secondary call is interrupted due to the arrival of primary sessions in detrimental of forced <b>call</b> <b>termination</b> probability. Because of its larger duration, each secondary call is exposed to a larger number of interruptions. Thus, as explained above, in order to guarantee the required QoS, in terms of the forced <b>call</b> <b>termination,</b> more channels need to be reserved in detrimental of the maximum achievable system Erlang capacity. Also, for a given value of the utilization factor of the primary channels, as the relative service time increases, the departure rate of successfully terminated calls decreases relative to the arrival rate of primary sessions; thus, the average number of idle channels decreases in detrimental of the new call blocking probability and, consequently, in detrimental of system capacity. The joint effect of these facts leads us to the behavior explained above and illustrated in Fig.  8.|$|R
