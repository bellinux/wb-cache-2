40|$|An {{innovative}} panel-to-structure {{sliding connection}} for isostatic large concrete cladding walls has been experimentally tested at Politecnico di Milano to verify {{its capacity to}} not get tangled in plane even when subjected to the maximum out-of-plane force {{for which it is}} designed. In the two versions, for vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>panels,</b> the out-of-plane force is axial and shear, respectively. A uniaxial test setup with application of constant axial or shear force has been realized, with the possibility to slide with very low friction on mechanical linear guides. The tests show that the connection is able to slide even under the constant application of the maximum out-of-plane load with stable hysteretic cycles, and static and dynamic friction coefficients have been experimentally evaluated. Such coefficients are useful in the design phase, especially regarding the panel-to-foundation connection, which is normally conceived as clamped to avoid geometric changes due to rocking of the panel. An example of calculation of forces in the connections is proposed for both the case of vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>panels...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the main {{results of an}} experimental campaign carried out within the FP 7 -SME European research project SAFECLADDING devoted to {{the improvement of the}} seismic performance of precast structures with cladding panels. The beneficial effects of dissipative cladding connection systems in providing additional structural damping through energy dissipation mechanisms, mainly based on plasticity and friction, are investigated. Different types of connectors are considered, including a panel-to-column and two panel-to-panel connection devices. The panel to-column device is designed for <b>horizontal</b> <b>panels</b> and consists of a steel plate folded at right-angle along three lines to get a W-shaped profile. In this way, the dissipative connection system allows to achieve stiffness and strength against out-of-plane loading, as well as flexibility and ductility to accommodate in-plane panel-to-structure relative displacements. The panel-to-panel connectors are friction-based or plasticity-based devices made by steel plates inserted into appropriate recesses within the joints in between vertical or <b>horizontal</b> <b>panels.</b> If the panels are connected to the frame structure by means of statically determined schemes, the panel-to-panel dissipative connections make the whole façade much stiffer and integral part of the earthquake resisting system up to the force associated with the friction threshold or yielding of the devices. Cyclic experimental tests on both single dissipative connectors and structural sub assemblies consisting of two full scale panels have been performed at the Laboratorio Prove Materiali of Politecnico di Milano to investigate the hysteretic behavior of the devices considering different technological features, restraint conditions, and loading protocols. Cyclic and pseudo-dynamic experimental tests have also been performed at the European Laboratory for Structural Assessment of the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission on full scale prototypes of precast buildings with vertical or <b>horizontal</b> <b>panels.</b> The results of the experimental tests confirm the remarkable improvement of the seismic performance of precast structures based on the beneficial effects of dissipative cladding connections, which can provide suitable energy dissipation capacity and limit forces and displacements under earthquake excitation...|$|R

The interior of the building is mostly original with large, open retail areas on the first and second floors.|$|E
50|$|Upon the {{rectilinear}} base stand two highly stylized figures. Each {{figure is}} somewhat lozenge-shaped and rises vertically. Each has a frontal, symmetrical, flat surface that {{contrasts with the}} gentle curve of the surfaces on the other sides. These flat surfaces are not quite parallel to {{the front edge of}} the base but instead slightly angle in toward each other. Both figures have narrow bases compared to the widths higher up, and they terminate on top with a flat, <b>horizontal</b> <b>panel</b> perpendicular to the front. The front of each figure has deep, circular holes, characteristic of Hepworth’s sculptures.|$|E
50|$|The Riviera Hotel is a {{historic}} hotel building at 719 Central Avenue in Hot Springs, Arkansas. It is a five story brick-faced structure, its main facade divided into two sections flanking a central panel. The outer sections are each topped by a rounded arch with carved foliate panels in the corner sections outside the arch. Bands of windows are separated by <b>horizontal</b> <b>panels</b> at the lower levels, {{and it has a}} commercial storefront on the ground floor. The building was designed by Charles L. Thompson and built about 1930. It is a locally significant architectural work reminiscent of the Chicago school.|$|R
50|$|The {{front and}} rear doors open into {{identical}} vestibules, with screened doors at the exterior and interior doors repeating the outside doors' fanlights, sidelights and surrounds. The door designs, six <b>horizontal</b> <b>panels</b> above two vertical ones, are similar to that on the neighboring Lincoln House. From the vestibules there is access to a large central room with coved ceiling. A main desk area is on the north with a dumbwaiter connecting it to a similar area on the second floor. The stair opening is to the south; examining rooms and offices are on the east and west.|$|R
5000|$|The {{glass roof}} is {{directly}} above the single centre platform. This is similarly to Yorkdale station, where the interior {{walls of the}} station at platform level are unfinished concrete, with curved sections over the tracks to form a lower ceiling. Unlike Yorkdale, the curve is less sudden making the walls more rounded in appearance and they are clad with white <b>horizontal</b> <b>panels</b> between vertical concrete [...] "ribs", along with a wider orange panel strip displaying the station name. Platform level seating is sheltered within glass walls. Wayfinding signage is backlit. Floors {{and some of the}} walls are clad with red-brown tiles.|$|R
50|$|The main entrance's {{pediment}} (west entrance) is of {{the most}} simple character; it consists of a compass heading with simple wood panels on the doors which may be of colonial manufacture. The brickwork surrounding the door is an understated pediment with no pilasters, pillars embedded in a wall. Its only decoration consists of rubbed brick accentuated by queen closers and an arch of flat bricks. The door itself is embellished by a wooden lunette, here a half-circle, and its two, center-opening doors have a small <b>horizontal</b> <b>panel</b> over two large vertical panels. The door’s wooden trim contains curved cyma reversa, a reversed S-shaped molding, pieces separating three panes. Wooden pegs are used in both the doors and windows. H-L hinges are used throughout the building.|$|E
50|$|The car shared its 10 ft {{wheelbase}} {{with its}} predecessor, the Jaguar Mark VII, which outwardly it closely resembled. However, the interior fittings were more luxurious {{than those of}} the Mark VII. Distinguishing visually between the models is facilitated by changes to the front grille, the driving or fog lamps being moved from the front panel to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>panel</b> between bumper & front panel, larger rear lamps and most obviously a curved chrome trim strip below the waistline which allowed the factory to offer a variety of two-tone paint schemes. In addition the new car had rear spats that were cut back to display more of the rear wheels and featured a one-piece slightly curved windscreen, where the Mark VII had incorporated a two-piece front screen of flat glass.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} iconic design of early leather flying helmet {{was known as}} the Type B helmet.
