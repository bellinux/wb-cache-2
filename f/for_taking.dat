40|$|Blume, Rubinfeld, and Shapiro (1984) first {{showed that}} {{compensation}} <b>for</b> <b>takings</b> {{can lead to}} a moral hazard problem that results in overinvestment in land suitable for public use. To the contrary, this paper shows that the compensation rule is irrelevant regarding the level of investment landowners make in their property, as well as the amount of land they authorize the government to acquire, both of which will be efficient. Intuitively, landowners recognize the equivalence of taxes and takings in budgetary terms, causing the distortionary effects of compensation and property taxation to cancel each other out through the balanced budget condition.

40|$|The {{mainstream}} literature discusses {{only the}} design {{that the government}} assesses property value <b>for</b> <b>takings</b> compensation ex post. A few papers propose to let condemnees self-assess property value ex ante. Two other alternatives—ex ante government assessment and ex post self-assessment—have been neglected. Furthermore, the literature usually assumes that assessments are accurate, not {{taking into account the}} facts that the actual takings compensation paid may not equal what the law intends to award. Finally, the literature often assumes that assessing is costless, failing to recognize that the actual high assessment costs may render undesirable an otherwise efficient standard <b>for</b> <b>takings</b> compensation. In this Article, I propose a framework of four prototype assessment methods <b>for</b> appraising <b>takings</b> compensation, based on who assesses and at what time. I use assessment costs and assessment accuracy to evaluate the merits of the four assessment methods. I find that, theoretically speaking, the scholarly-proposed models and the currently-implemented regimes are unlikely to produce accurate assessments, no matter which assessment method they use. These models or regimes are also not as low-cost as claimed...|$|R
