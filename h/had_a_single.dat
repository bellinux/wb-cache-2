5|$|The Order of the Pug The Order of the Pug, or Mops-Orden, is {{believed}} to have been founded in Bavaria in about 1740, to circumvent the Papal ban on Catholics becoming Freemasons.

5|$|The {{idea that}} venom <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> {{evolutionary}} origin {{has been called}} into question by a 2015 study, which found that venom proteins had homologs in many other tissues in the Burmese python. The study therefore suggested that venom had evolved independently {{in a number of}} snake lineages.|$|E
5|$|A seventh-century Armenian chronicler {{mentioned}} {{the existence of}} seventy Armenian monasteries in Palestine, {{some of which have}} been revealed in excavations. The Byzantines ceded Jerusalem to the Rashidun Caliphate after a siege in 637. Until this point, Jerusalem <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> Christian bishop. In 638, Armenians established their own archbishop, Abraham I. He was officially recognized by Rashidun Caliph Umar. The foundation of the Armenian migration to Jerusalem thus solidified. In the 12th century, around one thousand Armenians moved to Jerusalem with the Crusaders, presumably mainly from the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.|$|E
5|$|At any rate, Philip {{chose to}} build lembi. These were the small fast galleys {{used by the}} Illyrians. They <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> bank of oars {{and were able to}} carry 50 {{soldiers}} in addition to the rowers. With these, Philip could hope to avoid or evade the Roman fleet, preoccupied as he hoped it would be with Hannibal, and based, as it was, at Lilybaeum in western Sicily.|$|E

Neeta Lulla {{was brought in to}} design Chopra's clothes, while a non-film hair stylist named Asha Harirahan was chosen to design twelve different hair styles and the look of each character.

5|$|Pyramid D1 is on {{the east}} side of the Group D plaza. The pyramid had three stepped levels erected upon a low base. It faces west towards the plaza and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> access {{stairway}} flanked by sloping balustrades that terminate in vertical sections at the upper extremes. The pyramid was of fine workmanship using well-cut stone slabs. However, itw was poorly preserved and the southern part had partially collapsed. The surviving portions of the building allowed it to be accurately restored by archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|Since {{there were}} no sitting justices at the {{beginning}} of Washington's term, he had the unique opportunity to fill the entire body of United States federal judges with his selections. Despite this, Washington appointed only 28 judges to the United States district courts, due to the smaller size of the judiciary at the time; there were far fewer states, most states <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> district court, and each district <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> judge assigned to it. Because intermediate federal appellate courts had not yet been established, this, combined with the Supreme Court appointments, constituted the total number of federal judicial appointments made by Washington. The number is roughly 10% of the record 376 judges appointed by Ronald Reagan from 1980 to 1988, when the judiciary was much larger, and less than 5% of the number of active federal judges serving as of July 2010. Richard Peters, Jr. served for over 36 years, the longest of Washington's appointments.|$|E
5|$|That {{still left}} two {{separate}} governments {{claiming to be}} Poland's legitimate government: Piłsudski's in Warsaw, and Dmowski's in Paris. To ensure that Poland <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> government and to avert civil war, Paderewski met with Dmowski and Piłsudski and persuaded them to join forces, with Piłsudski acting as Provisional Chief of State and Commander-in-Chief while Dmowski and Paderewski represented Poland at the Paris Peace Conference. Articles 87–93 of the Versailles Treaty and the Little Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28 June 1919, formally established Poland as an independent and sovereign state in the international arena.|$|E

5|$|The French ironclad Invincible was {{the second}} of the three wooden-hulled s built for the French Navy in 1858–62. The ships of the Gloire class were {{classified}} as armoured frigates because they only <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> gun deck and their traditional disposition of guns arrayed {{along the length of the}} hull also meant that they were broadside ironclads. Invincible had an uneventful career and was deployed in North American waters during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. The unseasoned timber of her hull rotted quickly and she was condemned in 1872 and scrapped in 1876.|$|E
5|$|The Z-4 was {{designed}} as trainer. Although nearly identical to the Z-2 and Z-3, it featured several equipment changes optimised for blind flying training. The four-seat aircraft <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> control column with dual steering, which was achieved by a jib protruding to the right. Rudder pedals were in front of both seats. The defensive armament and bomb racks were reduced, or in most cases omitted to reduce weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was controlled by}} a fighter-type control stick and rudder bar which operated the powered flying controls (PFCs). Each PFC <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> electro-hydraulic powered flying control unit (PFCU) except the rudder which had two, one running as a back-up. Artificial feel and autostabilisation {{in the form of}} pitch and yaw dampers were provided, as well as an auto mach trimmer.|$|E

She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 {{shortly after the}} war began.|$|E
