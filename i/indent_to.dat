6000|$|The Englishman {{was hunting}} for {{the statue of}} a horse, a great horse hight Hunja, who was a steed of Irak, and a King's gift to Rao Omeda, one time monarch of Boondi. He {{found it in the}} city square as Tod had said; and it was an unlovely statue, carven after the dropsical fashion of later Hindu art. No one seemed to know {{anything}} about it. A little further on, one cried from a byway in rusty English: [...] "Come and see my Dispensary." [...] There are only two men in Boondi who speak English. One is the head, and the other the assistant, teacher of the English side of Boondi Free School. The third was, some twenty years ago, a pupil of the Lahore Medical College when that institution was young; and he only remembered a word here and there. He was head of the Charitable Dispensary; and insisted upon, then and there, organising a small levee and pulling out all his books. Escape was hopeless: nothing less than a formal inspection and introduction to all the native physicians would serve. There were sixteen beds in and about the courtyard, and between twenty and thirty out-patients stood in attendance. Making allowances for untouched Orientalism, the Dispensary is a good one, and must relieve a certain amount of human misery. There is no other in all Boondi. The operation-book, kept in English, showed the principal complaints of the country. They were: [...] "Asthama," [...] "Numonia," [...] "Skindiseas," [...] "Dabalaty" [...] and [...] "Loin-bite." [...] This last item occurred again and again--three and four cases per week--and {{it was not until the}} Doctor said [...] "Sher se mara" [...] that the Englishman read it aright. It was [...] "lion-bite," [...] or tiger, if you insist upon zoological accuracy. There was one incorrigible idiot, a handsome young man, naked as the day, who sat in the sunshine, shivering and pressing his hands to his head. [...] "I have given him blisters and setons--have tried native and English treatment for two years, but it is no use. He is always as you see him, and now he stays here by the favour of the Durbar, which is a very good and pitiful Durbar," [...] said the Doctor. There were many such pensioners of the Durbar--men afflicted with chronic [...] "asthama" [...] who stayed [...] "by favour," [...] and were kindly treated. They were resting in the sunshine their hands on their knees, sure that their daily dole of grain and tobacco and opium would be forthcoming. [...] "All folk, even little children, eat opium here," [...] said the Doctor, and the diet-book proved it. After laborious-investigation of everything, down to the last <b>indent</b> <b>to</b> Bombay for Europe medicines, the Englishman was suffered to depart. [...] "Sir, I thank ...," [...] began the Native Doctor, but the rest of the sentence stuck. Sixteen years in Boondi does not increase knowledge of English; and he went back to his patients, gravely conning over the name of the Principal of the Lahore Medical School--a College now--who had taught him all he knew, and to whom he intended to write. There was something pathetic in the man's catching at news from the outside world of men he had known as Assistant and House Surgeons who are now Rai Bahadurs, and his parade of the few shreds of English that still clung to him. May he treat [...] "loin-bites" [...] and [...] "catrack" [...] successfully for many years. In the happy, indolent fashion that must have merits which we cannot understand, he is doing a good work, and the Durbar allows his Dispensary as much as it wants.|$|E

One of them named as "X-ray jet" is the subject of our study. We <b>indent</b> <b>to</b> investigate the dynamics, evolution and physical properties of this phenomenon. We combine spatially and temporally multi-instrument observations obtained simultaneously with the SUMER spectrometer onboard SoHO, EIS and XRT onboard Hinode, and EUVI/SECCHI onboard the Ahead and Behind STEREO spacecrafts. We derive plasma parameters such as temperatures and densities as well as dynamics by using spectral lines formed in the temperature range from 10 000 K to 12 MK. We also use image difference technique to investigate the evolution of the complex structure of the studied phenomenon. With the available unique combination of data we were able to establish that the formation of a jet-like event is triggered by not one but several energy depositions which are most probably originating from magnetic reconnection. Each energy deposition is followed by the expulsion of pre-existing or new reconnected loops and/or collimated flow along open magnetic field lines. We derived in great detail the dynamic process of X-ray jet formation and evolution. We also found for the first time spectroscopically in the quiet Sun a temperature of 12 MK and density of 4 10 ^ 10 cm^- 3 in a reconnection site. We raise an issue concerning an uncertainty in using the SUMER Mg X 624. 9 A line for coronal diagnostics. We clearly identified two types of up-flow: one collimated up-flow along open magnetic field lines and a plasma cloud formed from the expelled BP loops. We also report a cooler down-flow along closed magnetic field lines. A comparison is made with a model developed by Moreno-Insertis (2008). Comment: 15 pages, 15 figure...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} literature describing simulation of drilling process. It considers both {{the negative impact of}} vibrations, arising when cutting, on the given technological process (emerging so-called chatter) and the positive effects (chip breakage). The paper also examines different models used in modern works and presents basic equations of dynamics, taking into account the regenerative effect, including transverse, axial and torsional degree of freedom. Besides, it describes methods to calculate the chip thickness desirable in cutting force model. Two existing approaches to study dynamics of drilling process are discussed in detail: analytical stability analysis and time domain investigation. The first method is based on eigenvalue problem solution of delayed differential motion equation discretized in the time domain. As to the second approach, full time domain numerical modeling of drilling process using geometry algorithms is conducted. This work emphasizes the analysis of forces acting on the tool during machining. General cutting force models used in modern works are considered. The paper describes main approaches to process damping phenomenon (interaction between cutting tool flank face and work-piece) modelling. It notes the feature specific only to the drilling – near the tip of the tool the chisel edge occurs to <b>indent</b> <b>to</b> the material instead of cutting. From the authors’ point of view the most complete is the model, where a cutting edge is divided into three zones (indentation zone, secondary cutting edge, and primary cutting edge), each of which uses different equations in the model of forces. Additional advantage of this model is that there is an experimental technique to determine cutting coefficients. The paper ends with a detailed classification of existing models of drilling dynamics.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{deformation}} mechanisms of MMCs subjected to micro-indentation by a spherical indenter using a three-dimensional finite element modeling. It {{was found that}} deformation behavior, hardness and work hardening of MMCs were highly dependant on the location of indentation relative to particles, volume percentage of the particle, and the size ratio of <b>indenter</b> <b>to</b> particle. The hardness of an MMC varied in a complex manner depending on the restriction on the matrix flow by reinforced particles and work hardening of the matrix material. Hardness increased {{with the increase of}} volume percentage of reinforced particles and decrease of the size ratio of <b>indenter</b> <b>to</b> particle. Matrix flow due to indentation was highly non-uniform which generated an inhomogeneous strain filed in an MMC. These pose a question that the conventional definition of micro-hardness is not very appropriate for characterizing MMCs...|$|R

It is {{revealed}} that the conventional reduced modulus used in depth-sensing indentation tests is invalid for a flat-ended cylindrical <b>indenter</b> due <b>to</b> {{the fact that the}} contact area during the loading is a constant irrelative to load. The load-displacement curve of flat punch is related to the length of the punch and the ratio of the elastic modulus of the <b>indenter</b> <b>to</b> the specimen (the modulus ratio Ei/E). Furthermore, theoretic analysis and finite element simulation demonstrated that, for conical indenter, the measured hardness from depth-sensing indentation tests would increase with increasing modulus ratio because the load increased with the ratio for the same displacement...|$|R
