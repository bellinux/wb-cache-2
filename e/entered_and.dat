Kelly and Dunlod also <b>entered</b> <b>and</b> won endurance races at the Indian national equestrian games, convincing the Equestrian Federation of India to sanction a national show for indigenous horses– the first in the country.

5|$|After thirty-four {{hours of}} lying in state, {{the doors of}} the Capitol were closed to the public and Nancy Reagan was escorted in, where she had a moment alone with the casket. A {{military}} honor guard <b>entered</b> <b>and</b> carried it down the west steps of the Capitol to a 21-gun salute where Nancy, holding her hand over her heart, met it. After it was placed in a hearse, the motorcade departed on the five-mile-trip (8km) to the Washington National Cathedral, where the state funeral service was to be held; crowds lined the route of the cortege as the hearse made its way.|$|E
5|$|Despite Canterbury's walls, a Viking army {{successfully}} {{attacked the}} city in 835, killing many of the inhabitants. Scandinavian raids recommenced from 991 onwards and in 1011 a Danish army demanded fresh tribute from the city. The city walls were used to defend the city during an 11-day siege, and the chronicler Roger of Hoveden recounts how the attacking Danes were thrown off {{the tops of the}} walls to their deaths by the citizens. Roger's account may be an exaggeration, but the story shows that the city walls were in sufficiently good condition for such a story to be considered plausible at the time. After a fire broke out in the city, however, the Danes <b>entered</b> <b>and</b> pillaged Canterbury.|$|E

5|$|Following her {{recovery}} from breast cancer, Minogue released her tenth studio album X in 2007.

Critical reception towards X was generally favourable, but many critics felt that it lacked introspection from Minogue's side. Later on, critics argued that the album did not serve as a worthy comeback for Minogue.|$|E
5|$|In close {{proximity}} is the burial of Tutankhamun. This {{is perhaps the}} most famous discovery of modern Western archaeology. It was discovered here by Howard Carter on November 4, 1922, with clearance and conservation work continuing until 1932. This was the first royal tomb to be discovered that was still largely intact, although tomb robbers had <b>entered.</b> <b>And</b> until the excavation of KV63 on 10 March 2005, it considered the last major discovery in the valley. The opulence of his grave goods notwithstanding, Tutankhamun was a relatively minor king, and other burials probably had more numerous treasures.|$|E

5|$|Other {{multi-ethnic}} {{parts of}} Europe frequently found war memorials equally contentious. In Flanders, the IJzertoren, a controversial Flemish memorial tower, was opened in 1930, commemorating the sacrifices during the war, but also celebrating Flemish identity and marking the hard treatment of Flemish activists by the Belgian authorities during the conflict. In disputed multi-ethnic territories in the east, such as Transylvania, {{the war had}} created bitter memories between Hungarian and Romanian inhabitants. The arguments were played out in differences {{as to how the}} dates of the war-in which Hungary and Romania had <b>entered</b> <b>and</b> left at different times-were recorded on tombstones and other memorials. In Serbia, the Kosovo Maiden was extensively used in war memorials, drawing a link between the war and the Battle of Kosovo.|$|E
