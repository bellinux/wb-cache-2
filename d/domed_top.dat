5|$|The {{depiction}} of the galero in arms can vary greatly depending on the artist's style. The top of the hat may be shown flat or round. Sometimes the brim is shown much narrower; with a <b>domed</b> <b>top</b> it can look like a cappello romano with tassels, but in heraldry it is still called a galero. The tassels may be represented as knotted cords.|$|E
25|$|The main summit bears {{a number}} of rock tors, {{protruding}} sharply from the heathery plateau. King's How has a steep sided <b>domed</b> <b>top.</b> Both bear cairns. The view {{from the top of}} the fell is quite beautiful: King's How gives a classic view of Derwentwater with Skiddaw in the background, while Borrowdale and the high fells round its head show well in the opposite direction.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} of the towers has a {{slightly}} projecting central section, topped by a pediment, on each of its two outward faces, with a large clock in the center. Above it is a metal section with two smooth Ionic columns in the corners and a round-arched louvered vent with a keystone. Broad overhanging eaves set off the next section, {{the base of the}} cupola, with a shingled face and oculus. Above another set of eaves is a small <b>domed</b> <b>top</b> with an acorn-shaped finial.|$|E
50|$|The Tigirekskiy Reserve {{occupies}} the watershed {{of the right}} tributaries of the Charysh River and {{the headwaters of the}} Aley River, including the Tigerksky range of mountains, in the northwest of the Altai-Sayan mountains. The terrain is mostly mid-level mountains with <b>domed</b> <b>tops.</b> The river valleys are deep with steep, precipitous sides.|$|R
50|$|The Kassites {{produced}} {{a substantial amount}} of pottery. These pieces were generally made for functional purposes or burial goods. Many small pottery kilns, generally no bigger than 2 meters in diameter with <b>domed</b> <b>tops,</b> were found in the Babylonian city of Dilbat. Goblets and wavy sided bowls are commonly found in Kassite pottery deposits. Other ceramic goods, such as traps for small animals and vessels commonly thought to be fruit stands were found also.|$|R
2500|$|These {{cumuliform}} {{clouds of}} free convection have clear-cut medium-grey flat bases and white <b>domed</b> <b>tops</b> {{in the form}} of small sproutings and generally do not produce precipitation. [...] They usually form in the low level of the troposphere except during conditions of very low relative humidity when the clouds bases can rise into the middle altitude range. [...] Moderate cumulus is officially classified as low-level and more informally characterized as having vertical extent that can involve more than one altitude level.|$|R
25|$|As {{technology}} {{improved and}} operational knowledge grew, Oceaneering upgraded their fleet of JIMs. The magnesium construction {{was replaced with}} glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) and the single joints with segmented ones, each allowing seven degrees of motion, and when added together giving the operator a very great range of motion. In addition, the four-port <b>domed</b> <b>top</b> of the suit {{was replaced by a}} transparent acrylic one that was taken from Wasp, this allowed the operator a much-improved field of vision. Trials were also carried out by the Ministry of Defence on a flying Jim suit powered from the surface through an umbilical cable. This resulted in a hybrid suit with the ability of working on the sea bed as well as mid water.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} version are two-sided bags, either joined {{round the}} edges or folded and joined along two sides. Webbing straps may be stitched to doubler patches {{which are then}} glued or welded to the bag on light duty bags, but on large and heavy duty bags there are usually strips of bag material bonded to the bags which form flat retaining tubes for the webbing which is threaded through the tubes and may be withdrawn for maintenance and inspection. heavy duty open bags are generally conical with a <b>domed</b> <b>top</b> or a reversed truncated cone top, and may have several straps from the lifting point at the bottom, through the guide tubes on the sides, to a crown ring of webbing or steel at the top, to spread the load evenly over {{the fabric of the}} bag.|$|E
25|$|The town {{is known}} for {{gingerbread}} biscuits which were first made in 1740 by William Eggleston. Eggleston, a baker by trade, was a producer of a biscuit called Grantham Whetstones. Whetsones were a rusk like dry biscuit enjoyed locally and also by coach drivers who used to stop in Grantham to change their horses whilst travelling on the Great North road. According to folklore, Egglestone, whilst baking whetsones in his dimly lit kitchen one morning, mistook one ingredient for another, resulting in a ginger-like biscuit {{to emerge from the}} oven. The mistake was a huge success and the biscuit became established as Grantham gingerbread, known as a white gingerbread because it is not made with molasses or black treacle. This provides a delicate ginger flavour, rich in butter, with a <b>domed</b> <b>top</b> that has a crackled surface. The centre is hollow and resembles a honeycomb.|$|E

5000|$|The {{design of}} the Elizabethan mansion was a {{quadrangle}} of four bays in the local red sandstone, built around a central courtyard, and was symmetrical but not classical. The main entrance was a gateway flanked by octagonal towers with <b>domed</b> <b>tops</b> and bridged by a crenellated wall. The towers are prominent in an engraving of the ruins, after Peter de Wint, which dates from around 1818 and appears in George Ormerod's The History of the County Palatine and City of Chester. Brereton Hall, built some twenty years later by Sir John Savage's ward and son-in-law Sir William Brereton, was modelled on Rocksavage and copied its paired octagonal towers. Unlike Brereton Hall, the string courses of the Rocksavage towers extended around the adjoining walls.|$|R
50|$|Built in 1858, {{the church}} is a stone Gothic Revival style {{structure}} consisting of two gabled limestone sections: a one story rectangular main block and an attached modern side wing.

2500|$|The sketch/sitdown {{comedy series}} {{starring}} Irish comic Dave Allen featured several Who parodies throughout its long run. A prominent example originally aired {{in the early}} 1970s – an Irish country priest is tidying up his church, then quickly becomes aware that the baptismal font (which is roughly cylindrical, with a wide base and a <b>domed</b> <b>top)</b> is following him. As the cleric quickens his pace down the nave, the font charges after him screaming in metallic tones, [...] "Exterminate! Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy!" [...] The priest ducks behind the pulpit, which then dematerializes (accompanied by the familiar TARDIS sound effects).|$|E
2500|$|With time an issue, the {{construction}} team worked around the clock. The <b>domed</b> <b>top,</b> housing {{the top five}} levels (including the restaurants and observation deck), was perfectly balanced so that the restaurant could rotate {{with the help of}} one tiny electric motor, originally , later replaced with a [...] motor. With paint colors named Orbital Olive for the body, Astronaut White for the legs, Re-entry Red for the saucer, and Galaxy Gold for the roof, the Space Needle was finished in less than one year. It was completed in April 1962 at a cost of $4.5 million. The last elevator car was installed the day before the Fair opened on April 21. During the course of the Fair nearly 20,000 people a day rode the elevators to the Observation Deck. The 20,000 mark was never reached, missed by fewer than 50 people one day. At the time of construction, it was the tallest building in the West, taking the title from the Smith Tower across town that had held that title since 1914.|$|E
40|$|To obtain Zirconium Carbide (ZrC) coating with {{columnar}} structure, {{which is}} optimal for {{resistance to heat}} shocks, chemical vapor deposition was used. Three series of multi-steps were carried to decrease the degree of supersaturation of active [C]: reducing concentration of C 3 H 6, substituting C 3 H 6 by lower-carbon-content hydrocarbons and the last increasing the flow rate of H 2. Scanning electron microscopy show the morphology evolution of ZrC coatings from two-dimensional platelets, to fine grains, to polycrystals with different shapes and to columnar with <b>domed</b> <b>tops.</b> When the flow rate of H 2 reach maximum (0. 3 m 3 /h), the columnar grains have a width of 1 - 2 ȝm and a preferred orientation of (220).

2500|$|There {{have been}} about 145,000 {{funerals}} at the cemetery since burials began in 1851. [...] It opened {{at the height of}} the Victorian era, when people [...] "made a cult of death" [...] and favoured large funerals and substantial, ornate tombs; and many famous and important Brightonians were buried there. [...] Six tombs are listed by English Heritage for their architectural and historical interest. [...] A single listing covers three tombs standing next to each other in the northwest part of the cemetery. [...] One, in the Greek Revival style, contains an unknown interment. [...] A large Gothic Revival Portland stone and marble mausoleum with granite columns and carved spandrels, resembling a dovecote, holds the remains of John Collingwood, who died in 1861. [...] Rev. Frederick William Robertson, the acclaimed theologian and preacher who held the perpetual curacy of Brighton's Holy Trinity Church and enjoyed walking in the churchyard at Hove, was buried in the third tomb when he died aged 37 in 1853. [...] His tomb is an Egyptian-style pylon with bronze motifs donated by the congregation at Holy Trinity Church and the Brighton Mechanics Institution, which he founded. [...] Further to the east, the Baldwin family memorial, also Grade II-listed, dates from the 1930s. John Leopold Denman, a prolific local architect who specialised in commercial buildings, executed the curious cruciform design with a <b>domed</b> <b>top</b> and stone walls. [...] It has a cornice interrupted by rounded mouldings, an arched entrance flanked by columns with decorative capitals and a recessed bronze door. [...] The Ford family's Gothic Revival mausoleum, another Grade II-listed structure, dates from 1889 and resembles a columbarium with its steep gabled roof and multiple openings. [...] It is of stone with pink granite columns and a base surrounded with iron railings. [...] Members of another local family, the Rays, are buried in [...] "the grandest memorial in the cemetery"—a giant mausoleum which is nearly attached to the chapel. [...] It is a granite and flint structure built into the hill behind, with an arched entrance, carved panels, buttresses, Classical-style decorations and hood moulds. [...] There is space for 42 burials.|$|E

A little warm breeze swept into the almost empty room, and outside a blaze of {{sunshine}} rested on the prairie. It was torn up with wheel ruts about the house, for the wooden building rose abruptly without fence or garden from the waste of whitened grass. Close to it there stood a birch-log barn or stables, its sides curiously ridged and furrowed where the trunks were laid on one another, roofed with wooden shingles that had warped into hollows here and there. Further away there rose another long building, apparently of sod, and a great shapeless yellow mound with a <b>domed</b> <b>top</b> towered behind the latter. It was most unlike a trim English rick, besides being bigger, and Agatha wondered what it could be. As a matter of fact, it was a not uncommon form of granary, the straw from the last thrashing flung over a birch-pole framing.|$|E
