In this paper, a seminal view on recent advances in techniques for hyperspectral data processing was provided. It examines the performance of image processing techniques specifically developed for hyperspectral data in the context of individual timber species inventory mapping applications. The area chosen, located in Berangkat Forest Reserve, Kelantan near the locality of Kompleks Perkayuan Kelantan sawmill, had relatively virgin <b>dense</b> <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> density at the time of imagery acquisition (dry month). The main focus is on the development of approaches able to naturally integrate the spatial and spectral information available from the hyperspectral data. Special attention is paid to techniques that circumvent the curse of dimensionality introduced by high-dimensional data spaces. Image processing was carried out in two steps, namely data conversion from radiance units to reflectance using a radiative transfer method and application of the mapping algorithm, specifically designed for identifying superficial materials based on similarities between image pixels and spectra from a spectral library of timber species. Experimental results, focused in this work on a specific case-study of individual timber species data analysis, demonstrate the success of the considered techniques. The results sho...|$|E

However, data describing the thermal 3 D structure of canopies and how they vary both spatially and temporally remain sparse. Coincident RGB and thermal imagery from a UAV platform were collected of both a standalone tree and a relatively <b>dense</b> <b>forest</b> <b>stand</b> in the sub-alpine Eastern Swiss Alps. For the first time, SfM-MVS methods were used to develop 3 D RGB and thermal point clouds of the two sites with point densities of 35, 245 and 776 points per m 2, respectively, compared to 78 points per m 2 for an airborne LiDAR dataset of the same area. Despite the low resolution of the thermal imagery compared to RGB photosets, forest structural elements were accurately resolved in both point clouds. Improvements {{in the quality of}} the thermal 3 D data were gained through the application of a distance filter based on the proximity of these data to the RGB 3 D point data. Vertical temperature gradients of trees were negative with increasing height at the standalone tree, but were positive in the dense stand largely due to increased self-shading of incoming shortwave energy. Repeat surveys across a single morning during the snowmelt period revealed changes in the spatial distribution of canopy temperatures which are consistent with canopy warming from direct solar radiation. This {{is the first time that}} coincidentally acquired RGB and thermal imagery have been combined to generate separate RGB and thermal point clouds of 3 D structures.

These forest heights were subsequently converted to forest biomass through forest height-biomass relation (allometry).

To facilitate a direct biomass comparison of the Pol-InSAR-height extraction with ground measurements, the effective height heff was introduced as a direct biomass equivalent. Examples from spruce dominated sites of variable stand densities showed a sensitivity of the height extraction to the stand density, though not in correlation with the heff.

The more closed and generally <b>denser</b> <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> led to increased plant competition that induced higher levels of stress for forest trees less than 50 cm in diameter when compared with urban street rees of comparable diameters.

40|$|In {{remotely}} sensed aerial images or digitized aerial {{photographs of}} high spatial resolution (10 - 100 cm/pixel) tree crowns are typically visible as almost distinct items. To produce semi-automatic forest inventories from such data (even stand-based inventories), {{it is better}} for the computer to deal directly with this predominant structural element of the images. A first obvious step is thus, the delineation of the individual tree crowns, preferably in a completely automatic fashion. This step is {{to be followed by}} an individual tree crown species recognition and then, a regrouping (if needed) into relatively conventional <b>forest</b> <b>stands.</b> Such a comprehensive approach can provide very detailed forest inventories, specially considering that regroupings can be organized to follow criteria other than that of the present inventories. This paper addresses the automatic individual tree crown delineation process. The individual tree crown delineation is accomplished by first following the valleys of shade that typically exist between the crowns of <b>dense</b> <b>forest</b> <b>stands.</b> The image from a selected spectral band is first smoothed. Areas that are completely in the shade are masked out by thresholding and local minima are found in the remaining areas, except for non-forested areas that were masked out a priori.

Sweden stretches between Lat. 55 N. and Lat. 69 N. and MODIS reflectance data are recorded at vastly different sun and viewing angles.

40|$|I {{investigated}} {{the consumption of}} wasps and bees by grizzly bears in the Yellowstone region, 1977 - 1992, using data collected during a study of radio-marked bears. Although wasps and bees were not {{a major source of}} energy, Yellowstone grizzly bears are among only a few populations of their species in North America known to consume these insects in sometimes noteworthy amounts. Consumption of wasps and bees was greatest during the driest months of the study and during years when abundant ungulate carrion and few whitebark pine seeds were available. Peak consumption during dry years probably reflected increases in wasp and bee populations, whereas little consumption during years when pine seeds were abundant probably reflected a relative preference for pine seeds. The odds that bears would consume wasps and bees were greatest when they were in <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> with abundant coarse woody debris and considerable live basal area. Excavation of ground nests also was most extensive in <b>dense</b> <b>forest</b> <b>stands.</b> All detected exploitation involved excavation of nests, almost all of which were located in or under logs and stumps or in duff near the base of trees. It is not clear if this pattern of exploitation reflected the distribution of wasps and bees, and, if so, why wasps and bees were concentrated in <b>dense</b> <b>forests</b> with abundant coarse woody debris. In short, Yellowstone grizzly bears apparently consumed wasps and bees most often when and where these insects were most abundant as well as when known high-quality bear foods were scarce.

All acorns were counted on 18 trees. Acorn production started around 20 years and plateaued around 80 years. Trees with inverted vase-shaped crowns typical of <b>dense</b> <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> produced fewer acorns than those with columnar- or mushroom-shaped crowns typical of more open areas. Open-grown trees growing in well-drained, loamy soils had the highest productivity within natural settings. Trees in urban parks with fertilization or irrigation also produced well.

Western Bluebirds were histori-cally birds of open areas, forest clearings, savannahs, or forest edges. However, recent dangerous declines have been noted for the Western Bluebird in many parts of its range.

The peaks of Khairiburu (1178 meters), Meghasani (1158 meters) and others welcome. Sweet scented champak flowers freshen the air. The richly hued orchids on the green foliage are soothing. In the midst of the <b>dense</b> <b>forests,</b> the summer <b>stands</b> humbled. Several rivers like Budhabalanga, Khairi, salandi, Palpala, etc. originate from the hills and meander through the forest. Many of them have cascading rapids and foaming falls before leaving for the plains.|$|R

However, harvesting machines cause damage to <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> and soils. The {{aim of this}} study is to examine the consequences skidding tracks have on net nitrogen mineralization and vegetation composition compared to adjacent <b>forest</b> <b>stands.</b> A beech <b>forest</b> on limestone as well as beech and Norway spruce forests on acidic soils were investigated in south Lower Saxony, Germany. Along the wheel tracks the net nitrogen mineralization is markedly reduced compared to the undisturbed stands. Although nitrogen mineralization is found to be low especially along the wheel tracks, ruderal plants with high nitrogen indicator values have established themselves. Along the skidding tracks, numerous species from fringe and ruderal communities, grasslands and wet sites occur while the stands are dominated by typical forest plant species. Therefore, species diversity is higher along the skidding tracks than in the adjacent stands...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{retrieve}} forest stem volume using CARABAS (coherent all radio band sensing) SAR images (28 – 60 MHz) has been investigated. The test {{site is a}} deciduous mixed forest {{on the island of}} Öland in southern Sweden. The images have been radiometrically calibrated using an array of horizontal dipoles. The images exhibit a clear discrimination between the forest and open fields. The results show that the dynamic range of the backscattering coefficient among the <b>forest</b> <b>stands</b> is higher than what has been found with conventional SAR using microwave frequencies. The backscatter increases with increasing radar frequency. This work shows an advantage compared to higher frequencies for stem volume estimation in <b>dense</b> <b>forests...</b>|$|R
40|$|In a closed-canopy <b>forest,</b> <b>stand</b> {{dynamics}} play {{an important}} role in shaping the forest, and it has been hypothesized that <b>dense</b> <b>forests</b> are not sufficiently limited by climate to warrant climate reconstruction. We collected Quercus prinus tree-ring data from a <b>dense</b> <b>forest</b> in the Appalachians, and after removal of stand dynamics and age trends we found strong influence of early summer precipitation on annual tree growth. We used the new Q. prinus chronology in a nested principal component analysis (PCA) of southeastern US Q. prinus chronologies and further strengthened the early summer precipitation signal in the tree-growth proxy, with favorable assessment of reconstruction skill. Our reconstruction was modeled using Bayesian regression, which allowed uncertainty to be quantified. The May–June precipitation reconstruction covered the period 1750 - 1981 and extended the instrumental record by 150 yr. It showed key drought years identified by other regional reconstructions, as well as an 11 yr quasi-periodicity that may be related to solar variability. This reconstruction has established a baseline precipitation record that can be used to measure changes brought about by global climate change.
