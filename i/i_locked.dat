He explained, [...] "Mikey was my best friend in the world and there's no Ministry without him. But I know the music we recorded together during the last weeks of his life had to be released to honor him. So after his funeral, <b>I</b> <b>locked</b> myself in my studio and turned the songs we had recorded into the best and last Ministry record anyone will ever hear. I can't do it without Mikey and I don't want to. So yes, this will be Ministry's last album." [...] The album, titled From Beer to Eternity, was released on September 6, 2013. Jourgensen stated that Ministry would tour in support of From Beer to Eternity, but would not record any more albums. In an April 2016 interview with Loudwire, however, Jourgensen mentioned the possibility of making another Ministry album [...] "if the circumstances are right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Based on {{the myth}} of Mbos (gardenia ternifolia), the mbos was the first tree created by the supreme being. However, it grew and kept growing until it reached the supreme being. The creator deity got angry with it, cut off its head and said: [...] "Tree of mbos, return to Earth". Shamed by {{the words of the}} deity, the mbos tree quickly {{returned}} to earth with its branches intertwined so that no one can climb it or pass under its shadow. When Roog created the ancestors of modern humans (maak - the great or elder), these ancient beings according to the myth hid under the mbos tree. After the creation of these beings, Roog created the dong (the younger). These new beings, wondered the earth trying to find the maak, whom they found hidden under the mbos tree. From that day on, the mbos tree became much in demand for making protective charms. In Serer symbolism, the mbos is the symbol of protection. Mbos means miscarriages, as in the song chanted at night by the initiates in Ndut classical teachings: Wagoxaam Mbos (<b>I</b> <b>locked</b> myself in the Mbos), a song with hidden meaning.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionType <b>I</b> <b>locking</b> of the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) is {{rare and}} is {{characterized}} by loss of extension at the MCPJ with full flexion of all joints of the digit. The condition is usually seen in the index and middle fingers when the normal osseous prominence or degenerative osteophytes of the radial condyle of the metacarpal head catches the accessory collateral ligaments of the MCPJ. Presentation of caseWe report on a case of Type <b>I</b> <b>locking</b> of the MCPJ affecting the index finger. The case was unusual because {{it might have been}} related to repeated stress while opening caps of specimen bottles in the laboratory. Furthermore, the impingement of the radial condyle of the metacarpal was to the sesamoid bone, and not to the collateral ligaments of the MCPJ. Finally, management was done by excision of the sesamoid bone rather than trimming of the prominence of the radial condyle of the metacarpals head. DiscussionLocking of the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) should be viewed as two different entities: The “locked MCPJ with further flexion possible” (Type <b>I</b> <b>locking)</b> and the “locked MCPJ with further flexion not possible” (Type II locking). Once the type of MCPJ locking is diagnosed clinically, radiological testing (X-rays, CT scan, MRI) may be done to direct further management to the cause of locking.

40|$|There {{are many}} reasons why {{contemporary}} American writer Joyce Carol Oates 2 ̆ 7 1990 novella <b>I</b> <b>Lock</b> My Door Upon Myself is not taught in secondary and post-secondary classrooms. Oates 2 ̆ 7 writing is frank, her voice feminist while echoing more traditional works that have broken into literary canons; however, the main reason why <b>I</b> <b>Lock</b> My Door Upon Myself is not taught {{is that it is}} a relatively new text, and, thus, ways in which to teach it have not yet been explored. There {{are many reasons}} why Oates 2 ̆ 7 novella should be taught in the classroom. Her language is poetic, and her story, a revision of sorts of Edith Wharton 2 ̆ 7 s Ethan Frome, is complex, offering windows into history and contemporary questions of gender roles, racism, and social class distinctions. When studied within the context of the texts it echoes, <b>I</b> <b>Lock</b> My Door Upon Myself can offer ways through which students might examine how texts comment upon each other.;One aspect of Oates 2 ̆ 7 work that needs to be fully examined within a classroom is her focus on the definition of a woman and a mother. The narration of the story takes place years after its main action, which occurs in 1912. Examining the shifting narrative in the novella, a position which is sometimes held by the protagonist 2 ̆ 7 s granddaughter, is as interesting as examining the moral codes present in the text as they differ depending upon the time, gender, race, and social class of the characters. While unlocking <b>I</b> <b>Lock</b> My Door Upon Myself in a classroom will be difficult, focusing upon new ways through which to teach new literature can certainly aid a classroom examination of Oates 2 ̆ 7 wonderfully complex text. Exploring the historical context of the novella as well as the social questions prompted by <b>I</b> <b>Lock</b> My Door Upon Myself can lead students toward a sophisticated reading of the text...|$|R
