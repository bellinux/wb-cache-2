5|$|A delayed or {{deployable}} surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB) is a soft inflatable tube which <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> a reel or spool line at one end, and is inflated by the diver under water and released to float to the surface, deploying the line as it ascends. This provides {{information to the}} surface that the diver is about to ascend, and where he is. This equipment is commonly used by recreational and technical divers, and requires {{a certain level of}} skill to operate safely. They are mostly used to signal the boat that the diver has started ascent or to indicate a problem in technical diving.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have a {{skeletal}} {{system that is}} structurally homologous to other tetrapods, though {{with a number of}} variations. They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are hollow and lightweight. The musculo{{skeletal system}} is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The pectoral girdle is supported by muscle, and the well-developed pelvic girdle <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.|$|E

5|$|In an aerotow a powered {{aircraft}} <b>is</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> a glider with a tow rope. Single-engined {{light aircraft}} or motor gliders are commonly used. The tow-plane takes the glider to the height and location {{requested by the}} pilot where the glider pilot releases the tow-rope. A weak link is often fitted to the rope to ensure that any sudden loads do not damage the airframe of the tow-plane or the glider. Under extreme loads the weak link will fail before {{any part of the}} glider or plane fails. There is a remote chance that the weak link might break at low altitude, and so pilots plan for this eventuality before launching.|$|E
