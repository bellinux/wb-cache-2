5|$|Between {{the world}} wars, Royal Navy ships were painted <b>dark</b> <b>gray</b> in the Home Fleet, light gray in the Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas, and {{white in the}} Indian Ocean and western Pacific. Many Home Fleet ships were painted medium gray during 1939 and 1940 to {{decrease}} visibility from the peacetime <b>dark</b> <b>gray.</b>|$|E
5|$|German Kriegsmarine ships {{before the}} Second World War were either light gray overall or had <b>dark</b> <b>gray</b> hulls, and many {{retained}} this scheme during the war. The cruiser Deutschland, for instance, had a gray hull and light gray superstructure in 1934. Others had dazzle camouflage, usually in combinations of pale gray, <b>dark</b> <b>gray</b> and sea blue. For example, {{the hull of}} the battleship Scharnhorst had a dazzle pattern of stripes on a gray background in 1940, but some of these were later painted out, and the bows forward of the main guns painted black. Scharnhorst was not camouflaged against air observation, her decks fore and aft bearing large black on white swastikas on a red field; her main gun turrets had red (in the Baltic) or yellow tops for air recognition. The battleship Bismarck set out to Norway in dazzle camouflage; this was painted out with gray for her final trip to the Atlantic. The cruiser Admiral Scheer wore a low contrast pattern of irregular <b>dark</b> <b>gray</b> marks on light gray for her superstructure, with a <b>dark</b> <b>gray</b> hull, black waterline and, away from air support while out raiding in 1941, <b>dark</b> <b>gray</b> turret tops.|$|E

5|$|Barium is a soft, silvery-white metal, with {{a slight}} golden shade when ultrapure. The silvery-white color of barium metal rapidly vanishes upon {{oxidation}} in air yielding a <b>dark</b> <b>gray</b> oxide layer. Barium has a medium specific weight and good electrical conductivity. Ultrapure barium {{is very difficult to}} prepare, and therefore many properties of barium have not been accurately measured yet.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} that the {{silicate}} particles have a real index of refraction ranging between 1.5 and 1.6 for visible light. However, there is a spectrum of colors associated with samples of volcanic ash, from very light to <b>dark</b> <b>gray.</b> This makes for variations in the measured imaginary refractive index under visible light.|$|E
5|$|Italian {{ships of}} Mussolini's navy {{retained}} its pre-war scheme of light gray overall for its smaller ships, but the larger units mostly had dazzle camouflage of <b>dark</b> <b>gray,</b> light sea blue, light sea green and light gray. Italian foredecks had a high-visibility pattern {{of red and}} white diagonal stripes so that their own aircraft would not attack them.|$|E
30|$|In studies associating mood, color, {{and mental}} health, healthy {{individuals}} identified <b>darker,</b> <b>grayer</b> colors with negative mood, and generally preferred brighter, more vivid colors [16 – 19]. By contrast, depressed individuals {{were found to}} prefer <b>darker,</b> <b>grayer</b> colors [17]. In addition, Barrick, Taylor, & Correa [19] found {{a positive correlation between}} self-identification with depression and a tendency to perceive one’s surroundings as gray or lacking in color. These findings motivated us to include measures of hue, saturation, and brightness in our analysis. We also tracked the use of Instagram filters, which allow users to modify the color and tint of a photograph.|$|R

5|$|T. m. nigrideus breeds from coastal {{northern}} Quebec to Labrador and Newfoundland and winters {{from southern}} Newfoundland south {{through most of}} the eastern US states to southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi and northern Georgia. It is uniformly darker or blackish on the head, with a <b>dark</b> <b>gray</b> back. The underparts are slightly more red than those of the nominate subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Type C is the {{smallest}} type and lives in larger groups than the others. Its eye patch is distinctively slanted forwards, rather than parallel to the body axis. Like type B, it is primarily white and medium gray, with a <b>dark</b> <b>gray</b> dorsal cape and yellow-tinged patches. Its only observed prey is the Antarctic cod.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the colored}} volva, A.atkinsoniana resembles A.onusta, which differs from A.atkinsoniana {{by the small}} to {{medium-sized}} fruit bodies with a grayish veil as <b>dark</b> <b>gray</b> to brownish gray warts and a basal bulb which is usually somewhat rooting. Sometimes the fruit bodies of A.atkinsoniana are confused with A.microlepsis which can be distinguished {{by the presence of}} reddish-brown to grayish-brown volval remnants and the rooting bulb of A.atkinsoniana.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 16.5-21.5 mm. The forewings {{are white}} or cream colored, sometimes with a stramineous (straw colored) tinge. There are various spots {{scattered over the}} wing. The hindwings are <b>darker</b> <b>gray.</b> Adults drink nectar from the flowers of the larval hosts.|$|R
5|$|A. r. scottii, {{described}} by George Sennett in 1888, is found from northern Arizona to New Mexico south to northeastern Sonora and northwestern Coahuila. It {{appears to be}} a <b>darker</b> <b>gray</b> than A. r. eremoeca and has narrower and darker rufous streaks on its breast.|$|R
5|$|Each {{ship had}} {{a crew of}} 854{{officers}} and enlisted men. The enlisted crew spaces were located forward in the upper deck, and were cramped and unhygienic. The cabins for non-commissioned officers were also located here. The superstructure included several cabins for senior officers. The ships were initially painted black but in the 1920s they were repainted gray. Alfonso XIII wore a white identification band on her funnel and Jaime I wore two, though both ships had them removed {{after the start of}} the Civil War. Jaime I was also repainted <b>dark</b> <b>gray</b> at this time.|$|E
5|$|Monk seals have {{a slender}} body and are agile. They have a broad, flat snout with {{nostrils}} on the top. Monk seals are polygynous, and group together in harems. They feed mainly on bony fish and cephalopods, {{but they are}} opportunistic. The skin is covered in small hair, which are generally black in males and brown or <b>dark</b> <b>gray</b> in females. Monk seals {{are found in the}} Hawaiian archipelago, certain areas in the Mediterranean sea (such as Cabo Blanco and Gyaros island), and formerly in the tropical areas of the west Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be employed}} {{in the field to}} aid in the identification of S.pungens. With an application of a drop of KOH, the flesh will turn vinaceous (the color of red wine), the tubes red, the cap cuticle black, and the stipe cuticle pale vinaceous. With ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), the flesh becomes very pale vinaceous, and the tubes turn bright red. Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) turns the flesh gray, the tubes <b>dark</b> <b>gray</b> to black, and the stipe cuticle light gray.|$|E
50|$|Proton density (PD) {{weighted}} {{images are}} created by having a long repetition time (TR) and a short echo time (TE). On images of the brain, this sequence has a more pronounced distinction between gray matter (bright) and white matter (<b>darker</b> <b>gray),</b> but with little contrast between brain and CSF.|$|R
50|$|Of the two {{distinct}} color variations, the predominant variant has a light cream-colored base, with reddish-brown blotching down the back, {{and black and}} white banding around the tail. The other variant has a much lighter, ash <b>gray</b> color, with <b>darker</b> <b>gray</b> blotching. The banding around the tail is still present.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 23-28 mm. The {{wings are}} whitish-gray with variable overlay of yellowish-brown and <b>darker</b> <b>gray.</b> The lines are black. The postmedial line has a rounded bulge near the forewing costa. There are four black spots along the costa. The discal spots {{are large and}} hollow on all wings.|$|R
5|$|The Malagasy {{mountain}} mouse or Koopman's montane voalavo (Monticolomys koopmani) is a rodent {{within the}} subfamily Nesomyinae {{of the family}} Nesomyidae, and {{is closely related to}} Macrotarsomys. It is monotypic within the genus Monticolomys. It is found in the highlands of eastern Madagascar. A small mouse-like rodent, it is dark brown on the upperparts and <b>dark</b> <b>gray</b> below. It has small, rounded, densely haired ears and broad feet with well-developed pads. The long tail lacks a tuft at the tip. The skull is delicate and lacks crests and ridges on its roof.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} of the {{nominate}} subspecies, S. c. carolinensis, has pale blue-gray upperparts, a glossy black cap (crown of the head), {{and a black}} band on the upper back. The wing coverts and flight feathers are very <b>dark</b> <b>gray</b> with paler fringes, and the closed wing is pale gray and black, with a thin white wing bar. The face and the underparts are white. The outer tail feathers are black with broad diagonal white bands across the outer three feathers, a feature readily visible in flight.|$|E
5|$|The area {{above the}} eyes, {{including}} the forehead, crown and nape, {{is a deep}} blue-black, through {{the top edge of}} the mantle. The mantle proper is a medium to dark gray-blue as are the tertials and upperwing-coverts, turning to a <b>dark</b> <b>gray</b> at the median, greater and primary coverts and the alula. The secondaries and inner primaries are fringed in gray-blue. The central rectrices are gray-blue, and the outer rectrices are a blackish-gray, paling towards the tips.|$|E
