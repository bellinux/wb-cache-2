5|$|Town Hall (set number 10224) was {{released}} in March 2012 and is the seventh set in the Modular Building line. The set contains 2766 pieces and is recommended for builders 14 and over. It was the largest modular set, taking the title from the Green Grocer. It contains many interior details, such as a working elevator, along with board tables and balconies {{to look to the}} floor below. Along with the interior details the set also has many exterior details, such as four pillars on the <b>front</b> <b>step</b> and windows {{at the back of the}} building, and also a clock tower at the top of the building. The date on the building, 1891 represents the birth year of the founder of LEGO and when reversed, it's the birth year of the designer, Astrid (1981). The set was priced at £149.99, $199.99 or €179.99 as released by LEGO on February 16, 2012. There are eight minifigures in the set with a wedding couple. The set had a global discontinuation date of 31 December 2014 and had a much shorter lifespan than its predecessors.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the system}} uses a mixed culture of microorganisms, besides not needing any enzyme addition, the {{fermentation}} requires no sterility or aseptic conditions, making this <b>front</b> <b>step</b> {{in the process}} more economical than in more popular methods {{for the production of}} cellulosic ethanol. These savings in {{the front end of the}} process, where volumes are large, allows flexibility for further chemical transformations after dewatering, where volumes are small.|$|E
25|$|The game ends {{when the}} Hood arrives {{at one of}} the pubs and is touched by the {{landlord}} from his <b>front</b> <b>step.</b> The landlord then takes charge of the Hood for the year, and is supposed to give everyone a free drink. The winning pub pours beer over the Hood and then hangs it behind the bar (each pub has two hooks especially for this purpose). According to legend, it used to be roasted on a spit over the pub fire having been doused with ale, which was then drunk by those present.|$|E

25|$|Afterwards {{he wrote}} to Kiggell (5 July) {{stressing}} that “the road to success lies through deliberation” and that “nothing is to be gained but very much is to be lost by trying to push on too rapidly”. He recommended “concentration and not dispersion of artillery fire” and “the thing is to advance along a wide <b>front,</b> <b>step</b> by step to very limited and moderate objectives, and to forbid going beyond those objectives until all have been reached by the troops engaged”, and urging Kiggell “not to show this letter to anyone”. He again wrote to Kiggell (26 July) urging him not let the Germans “beat you in having the better manpower policy”.|$|E

2500|$|During Superman's {{battle with}} the villain Atlas, and after Atlas incapacitates such heroes as Steel and Bibbo Bibbowski, Atlas laments {{that he has not}} faced a worthy opponent. Just then, Krypto emerges vowing to [...] "hurt this one" [...] because he [...] "loves man" [...] (Superman). [...] Krypto proves {{to be more than a}} match for Atlas, {{revealing}} Atlas' magical nature to Superman. This is the first and only story to show exactly what Krypto 'thinks', and although it's translated for readers, Krypto 'speaks' in a simplistic manner with broken English, rarely using pronouns. This story also focuses on how Superman has taught Krypto to be much calmer and well-behaved; Superman reassures Lois that Krypto loves her as well. Following the death of Pa Kent and Brainiac's attack on the family farm, Krypto arrives on the <b>front</b> <b>step</b> of the Kent Farm, to protect Martha Kent and provide companionship. A clone of Krypto made by Cadmus made an appearance in Power Girl.|$|E

2500|$|Alex coyly feigns illness to {{his parents}} {{to stay out of}} school the next day. Following an {{unexpected}} visit from P.R. Deltoid, his [...] "post-corrective adviser", Alex visits a record store, where he meets two pre-teen girls. He invites them back to the flat, where he drugs and rapes them. The next morning, Alex finds his droogs in a mutinous mood, waiting downstairs in the torn-up and graffitied lobby. Georgie challenges Alex for leadership of the gang, demanding that they pull a [...] "man-sized" [...] job. Alex quells the rebellion by slashing Dim's hand and fighting with Georgie, then in a show of generosity, takes them to a bar, where Alex insists on following through on Georgie's idea to burgle the home of a wealthy elderly woman. Alex breaks in and knocks the woman unconscious, but when he opens the door to let the others in, Dim strikes him in payback for the earlier fight. The gang abandons Alex on the <b>front</b> <b>step</b> to be arrested by the police; while in their custody, he learns that the woman has died from her injuries.|$|E
2500|$|In 1962, Gleason resurrected his {{variety show}} with more splashiness {{and a new}} hook: a fictitious general-interest {{magazine}} called The American Scene Magazine, through which Gleason trotted out his old characters in new scenarios; including two new Honeymooners sketches. He also added another catchphrase to the American vernacular, first uttered in the 1963 film Papa's Delicate Condition: [...] "How sweet it is!" [...] The Jackie Gleason Show: The American Scene Magazine was a hit, and continued for four seasons. Each show began with Gleason delivering a monologue and commenting on the attention-getting outfits of band leader Sammy Spear. Then the [...] "magazine" [...] features would be trotted out, from Hollywood gossip (reported by comedian Barbara Heller) to news flashes (played for laughs with a stock company of second bananas, chorus girls and dwarfs). Comedian Alice Ghostley occasionally appeared as a downtrodden tenement resident, sitting on her <b>front</b> <b>step</b> and listening to boorish boyfriend Gleason for several minutes. After the boyfriend took his leave, the smitten Ghostley would exclaim, [...] "I'm the luckiest girl in the world!" [...] Veteran comics Johnny Morgan, Sid Fields, and Hank Ladd were occasionally seen opposite Gleason in comedy sketches. Helen Curtis played alongside him as a singer and actress, delighting audiences with her 'Madame Plumpadore' sketches with 'Reginald Van Gleason.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite these exceptions, Number 10 {{has been}} known as the Prime Minister's {{official}} home for over one hundred years. By {{the turn of the}} 20th century, photography and the penny press had linked Number 10 in the public mind with the premiership. The introduction of films and television would strengthen this association. Pictures of prime ministers with distinguished guests at the door became commonplace. With or without the Prime Minister present, visitors had their picture taken. Suffragettes posed {{in front of the door}} when they petitioned H. H. Asquith for women's rights in 1913, a picture that became famous and was circulated around the world. In 1931, Mohandas Gandhi, wearing the traditional homespun dhoti, posed leaving Number 10 after meeting with Ramsay MacDonald to discuss India's independence. This picture, too, became famous especially in India. The freedom fighters could see their leader had been received in the Prime Minister's home. Couse's elegant, understated door—stark black, framed in cream white with a bold white [...] "10" [...] clearly visible—was the perfect backdrop to record such events. Prime Ministers made historic announcements from the <b>front</b> <b>step.</b> Waving the Anglo-German Agreement of Friendship, Neville Chamberlain proclaimed [...] "Peace with honour" [...] in 1938 from Number 10 after his meeting with Adolf Hitler in Munich. During World War II, Churchill was photographed many times emerging confidently from Number 10 holding up two fingers in the sign for [...] "Victory".|$|E

60|$|Before night, the Prince {{pulled up}} in the great city before {{the door of the}} inn in which Trumkard and himself had lodged. Trumkard was sitting on the <b>front</b> <b>step,</b> with a melon on his lap and a skin bottle between his knees. Hastily dismounting, the Prince threw himself upon the neck of his old friend with such force that he upset the old gentleman and his supper into a great pile together. Jumping up, and wiping the wine out of his eyes and the melon-juice out of his hair, Trumkard welcomed his young master, and assured him that he had several times {{wondered}} where he was. The Prince then led him in-doors, and related his adventures, and besought his advice.|$|E

6000|$|... "Just what I {{meant to}} do, my dear. And, when I had scared you sufficiently--you wouldn't {{wait for the}} story of my consumptive friend. Pity! It's one of my best!--I should have {{mentioned}} that I had been having much the same trouble myself until lately, but the other day I happened to try Nervino, the great specific.... I was giving you an illustration of myself in action, my dear. I went to these Nervino people--happened to see one of their posters and got the idea in a flash--I went to them and said, 'Here am I, a presentable man of persuasive manners and a large acquaintance among the leaders of New York Society. What would it be worth to you to have me hint from time to time at dinner parties and so forth that Nervino is the rich man's panacea?' I put the thing lucidly to them. I said, 'No doubt you have a thousand agents in the city, but have you one who does not look like an agent and won't talk like an agent? Have you one who is inside the houses of the wealthy, at their very dinner-tables, instead of being on the <b>front</b> <b>step,</b> trying to hold the door open with his foot? That is the point you have to consider.' They saw the idea at once. We arranged terms--not as generous as I could wish, perhaps, but quite ample. I receive a tolerably satisfactory salary each week, and in return I spread the good word about Nervino in the gilded palaces of the rich. Those are the people to go for, Jill. They have been so busy wrenching money away from the widow and the orphan that they haven't had time to look after their health. You catch one of them after dinner, just as he is wondering if he was really wise in taking two helpings of the lobster Newburg, and he is clay in your hands. I draw my chair up to his and become sympathetic and say that I had precisely the same trouble myself until recently, and mention a dear old friend of mine who died of indigestion, and gradually lead the conversation round to Nervino. I don't force it on them. I don't even ask them, to try it. I merely point to myself, rosy with health, and say that I owe everything to it, and the thing is done. They thank me profusely and scribble the name down on their shirt-cuffs. And there you are! I don't suppose," [...] said Uncle Chris philosophically, [...] "that the stuff can do them any actual harm." ...|$|E
