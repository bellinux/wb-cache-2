25|$|One {{historical}} {{problem with}} the U.S. system was known as job lock, in which people become tied to their jobs for fear of losing their health insurance. This reduces {{the flexibility of the}} labor market. Federal legislation passed since the mid-1980s, particularly COBRA and HIPAA, has been aimed at reducing job lock. However, providers of group health insurance in many states are permitted to use <b>experience</b> <b>rating</b> and it remains legal in the United States for prospective employers to investigate a job candidate's health and past health claims as part of a hiring decision. Someone who has recently been diagnosed with cancer, for example, may face job lock not out of fear of losing their health insurance, but based on prospective employers not wanting to add the cost of treating that illness to their own health insurance pool, for fear of future insurance rate increases. Thus, being diagnosed with an illness can cause someone to be forced to stay in their current job.|$|E
40|$|In the Bayesian approach, the <b>experience</b> <b>rated</b> premium is {{the value}} which {{minimizes}} an expected loss {{with respect to a}} posterior distribution. The posterior distribution is conditioned on the claim experience of the risk insured, represented by a n-tuple of observations.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate government intervention as an effective strategy for implementing accident prevention programs and reducing occupational injuries in the workplace. The central issue was to determine if participation in the California Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) Small Employer Voluntary Compliance Program (SEVCP) or compliance inspections conducted by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH) influenced workers' compensation <b>experience</b> <b>rates</b> among small employers in California. The sample populations examined in this study consisted of three groups: (1) twenty-five California companies that participated in the SEVCP during 1982; (2) twenty-five California companies that were inspected for safety standards compliance by DOSH officials in 1982; and (3) a control group that consisted of twenty-five California companies that did not participate in the SEVCP and were not inspected by DOSH. The problem was analyzed in three stages. First, the data were analyzed to determine if {{there was a significant difference}} in <b>experience</b> <b>rates</b> between the three sample groups. Second, the three groups were evaluated for significant difference in accident prevention program components. Third, the study analyzed the effect of accident prevention program components on workers' compensation <b>experience</b> <b>rates.</b> This study indicated that companies that participated in the SEVCP developed significantly lower workers' compensation <b>experience</b> <b>rates</b> when compared to companies that were inspected for safety standards compliance by DOSH. A significantly higher proportion of SEVCP companies provided new employees with job specific safe work practice training when compared to the DOSH and control group companies. Statistical analyses of the effect of individual accident prevention program components on <b>experience</b> <b>rates</b> revealed a significant reduction in the <b>experience</b> <b>rate</b> of companies that conducted regularly scheduled workplace safety inspections. This study supports the need for continued development, implementation, and evaluation of voluntary compliance programs as an effective means for reducing occupational injuries. Although this study failed to identify accident prevention program components as the primary factor in the SEVCP group's significantly lower <b>experience</b> <b>rate,</b> government sponsored voluntary compliance programs based on consultation, education, and training have the ability to significantly reduce occupational injuries...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} the 1 st nationwide survey {{on the use}} of alcohol by Japanese high school students. The survey design was a cross-sectional sampling survey.

Among sampled schools, 65. 6 % and 67. 0 % of junior high schools and senior high schools responded, respectively. A total of 117, 325 students responded and 115, 814 questionnaires were subjected to analysis. The current drinking rate was defined as the percentage of students who had drank alcohol at least 1 day within the 30 day period before answering the questionnaire, starting at 26. 0 % for boys and 22. 2 % for girls in the 1 st grade of junior high and increasing to 54. 9 % for boys and 43. 4 % for girls in the 3 rd grade of senior high school.

40|$|Abstract Background Changes {{in protein}} {{evolutionary}} rates among lineages have been frequently observed {{during periods of}} notable phenotypic evolution. It is also known that, following gene duplication and loss, the protein evolutionary rates of genes involved in such events changed because of changes in functional constraints acting on the genes. However, {{in the evolution of}} closely related species, excluding the aforementioned situations, the frequency of changes in protein evolutionary rates is still not clear at the genome-wide level. Here we examine the constancy of protein evolutionary rates in the evolution of four closely related species of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group (S. cerevisiae, S. paradoxus, S. mikatae and S. bayanus). Results For 2, 610 unambiguously defined orthologous genes among the four species, we carried out likelihood ratio tests between constant-rate and variable-rate models and found 344 (13. 2 %) genes showing significant changes in the protein evolutionary rates in at least one lineage. Of all those genes which <b>experienced</b> <b>rate</b> changes, 139 and 49 genes showed accelerated and decelerated evolution, respectively. Most of the evolutionary rate changes could be attributed to changes in selective constraints acting on nonsynonymous sites, independently of species-specific gene duplication and loss. We estimated that the changes in protein evolutionary rates have appeared with a probability of 2. 0 × 10 - 3 per gene per million years {{in the evolution of the}} Saccharomyces species. Furthermore, we found that the genes which <b>experienced</b> <b>rate</b> acceleration have lower expression levels and weaker codon usage bias than those which <b>experienced</b> <b>rate</b> deceleration. Conclusion Changes in protein evolutionary rates possibly occur frequently in the evolution of closely related Saccharomyces species. Selection for translational accuracy and efficiency may dominantly affect the variability of protein evolutionary rates. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Unemployment {{insurance}} is experience rated in the United States; {{companies that have}} more claims resulting from past workers face higher unemployment insurance rates.

[...] Unemployment {{insurance is}} financed by a payroll tax paid by employers. <b>Experience</b> <b>rating</b> in unemployment insurance is described as imperfect, {{due in large part to}} the fact that there are statutory maximum and minimum rates that an employer can receive without regard to its history of lay-off.
