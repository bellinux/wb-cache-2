40|$|This chapter {{draws on}} {{historical}} and conceptual accounts {{of learning to}} discuss and illuminate the nature and <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> learning for <b>occupations</b> through practice. This discussion includes {{an analysis of the}} historical development of practice settings as places where occupational knowledge is generated, transformed, and sustained over time. It includes some consideration of how these kinds of settings were and are now valued as sites for the learning. Going beyond historical accounts, some of the changing conceptions about processes of learning and how place and culture can shape learning, along with the contributions of the learner, are then discussed. In all, it is proposed that the majority of human development and learning associated with the development of occupational capacities has arisen through practice-based experiences. Before the advent of mass education, practice settings were the inevitable place {{for the development of the}} majority of occupational knowledge. Indeed, it is a relatively new phenomenon for this development to occur outside of the settings in which it is practised. Importantly, the kinds of knowledge developed through learning-related activities in practice settings are more than those underpinning easy and repetitive tasks. Instead, they comprise complex, demanding, and often difficult-to-learn knowledge. However, to fully realise the contributions of these settings effective conceptual premises and adaptive curriculum, pedagogical, and epistemological procedures are required.

40|$|Background. Some {{authors are}} {{beginning}} to challenge current categorisations <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> as self-care, productivity, and leisure in favour of categories that address meaning.

To provide a synthesis of the contemporary literature that considers the meaning <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> and to argue that phenom-enological insights into the meaning <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> might usefully inform occupa-tional therapy research, theory, and practice. Key Issues. Meaning is a key aspect <b>of</b> <b>occupation.</b> Three phenomenological meanings <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> uncovered by a study conducted in New Zealand—the call, Being-with and possibilities—provide a start-ing point for practice, research, and theory informed by understandings of the lived experience <b>of</b> <b>occupation.</b> Implications.

When occupational matching is important, we derive conditions under which firms provide ?optimal? training packages. Since the German system broadly meets these conditions, we evaluate the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> apprenticeship using a large administrative dataset. We find returns to apprenticeship for even the lowest ability school-leavers comparable to standard estimates of the return to school, and show that training is transferable across a wide range <b>of</b> <b>occupations,</b> such as a one-digit occupation group. We conclude that the positive experience with German Apprenticeship Training may guide the design of similar policies in other countries...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Quality circle are {{considered}} an important approach to improving behavior, increasing motivation, and reducing stress. The {{aim of this}} study was to determining the effect of training and applying quality control circles on the nurses’ level <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> satisfaction. Material and Methods: This research is a two-group quasi-experimental study that after selection of two EMS stations, by simple randomization method 25 nurses worked in central station of Hamden emergency medical service were chosen as the quality circle group and 16 nurses of central station of Malayer emergency medical service formed the control group. The tools was used in this research was the occupation satisfaction questionnaire that was made on Herzburg Two factor theory. After training and performing of quality circle in trial group the occupation satisfaction test was carried out on both groups to get the change taken place in their level of job satisfactions. Then statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Results: The analysis of data showed that before and after intervention there was significant differences in scores of health (P< 0. 001) and motivation factors (P< 0. 001) and also in global scores <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> satisfaction in quality circle group (P< 0. 001), but there was no significant differences before and after intervention in scores of health (P= 0. 069) and motivation factors (P= 0. 094) and also in global scores <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> satisfaction in control group (P= 0. 495). After intervention, the analysis of data showed significant differences in scores motivation factors (P= 0. 001) and global scores <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> satisfaction (P= 0. 003) whereas there was no significant differences in scores of health factors between two groups (P= 0. 089).

40|$|Occupational {{science is}} of {{importance}} to multiple disciplines due to its potential to contribute to understandings of complex social issues. “Occupation”, as a key concept of occupational science, is recognised as being highly complex, making it challenging for students to develop a comprehensive understanding of the concept. Terminology of occupational science literature has been noted at times as using the terms occupation, purposeful activity and activity interchangeably, which further adds {{to the challenge of}} teaching the concept. This paper explores evolving definitions <b>of</b> <b>occupation,</b> challenges this evolution has created within education, and the potential use <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> as a threshold concept. Consideration of a selection of pedagogic methods used in teaching the concept <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> is briefly explored. The paper concludes with identification of a newly developed occupation-focused teaching tool as a proposed alternative approach to teaching the concept <b>of</b> <b>occupation.</b> The teaching tool was originally developed to teach occupation as a discrete concept, rather than the therapeutic use <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> as taught in occupational therapy education.

40|$|Similarly to related {{developments}} such as {{blended learning}} and blended care, blended working is a pervasive and booming trend in modern societies. Blended working combines on-site and off-site {{working in an}} optimal way to improve workers' and organizations' outcomes. In this paper, we examine {{the degree to which}} workers feel that the two defining features of blended working (i. e., time-independent working and location-independent working) enhance their own functioning in their jobs. Blended working, enabled through the continuing advance and improvement of high-tech ICT software, devices, and infrastructure, may be considered beneficial for workers' perceived effectiveness because it increases their job autonomy. However, because blended working may have downsides as well, {{it is important to know}} for whom blended working may (not) work. As hypothesized, in a sample of 348 workers (51. 7 % women), representing a wide range <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> and organizations, we found that the perceived personal <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> blended working was contingent upon workers' psychological need strength.

40|$|Key words: metacognition, meta-emotion, {{feeling about}} feeling while doing with meaning Intent: The {{purpose of this}} paper is to pose a series of {{question}} for participants to consider: (1) What is the concept <b>of</b> meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> (adapted from metacognition) and (2) How may the concept be useful for contributing to the theoretical foundations of occupational science? Argument: In 2001 Royeen, Duncan, and McCormack, published a short definition meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation.</b> This was approximately at the same time a poster presentation on the concept (Royeen and Duncan, 2001) was presented. And, a short summary of it was presented for a major lecture (Royeen, 2003). Meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation,</b> as presented in these pieces will be summarized for this presentation. Doing with meaning is but one operational definition <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> in the published literature (Royeen, 2002). Meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> constitutes feeling about feeling while doing with meaning. Meta-emotion has been seen in the literature from 1996 through 2014 (Norman 2 ̆ 6 Furnes, 2014), mostly pertaining to family systems. Metacognition, from which meta-emotion is adapted, refers to thinking about thinking in a global sense, but not necessarily linked to thinking about thinking while doing at any level. In fact, due to the complex interplay of cognition and emotion, it is truly impossible to separate them. Thus, meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> is not just feeling about feeling while doing with meaning, but may also intertwine with cognition. That is to say, meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> is a holistic concept, related to the psychobiology of man as expressed by Meyer (1982). Emotion and reflection upon emotions are not just feelings based but also includes some degree of cognition. However, the concept <b>of</b> meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> is distinctly different from metacognition for two reasons: metacognition excludes the emotional subsystems and does not relate thinking to occupational engagement. Importance to occupational science: The essential concept <b>of</b> meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> is an innovative conceptualization to bring to occupational science. There is an emerging knowledge in occupational science, but the field has not adequately or sufficiently linked occupational science to the field of emotional systems of the human brain. It is speculated that meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> is one dimension or the process that underpins the restorative, pleasurable and productive qualities (or perceptions thereof) of occupational engagement. Further, it is speculated that almost any aspect of occupational engagement and its unique meaning for that instance, is directly related to the valence (positive or negative feelings) brought forth by reflection on participation in occupation. Conclusion: This theoretical presentation will explore the realm <b>of</b> participating in <b>occupation</b> and the feelings about feelings (meta-emotion) manifest during engagement in occupation. Questions to facilitate discussion importance to mission of SSO: USA: Given understanding <b>of</b> meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> as a concept, how and why is might it important for occupational science? How does meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> sideline the dichotomy of cognition versus emotion for a more holistic approach to reflexivity? Can meta-emotion <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> create a value-added function <b>of</b> participation in <b>occupation</b> for further advance understanding of our field...|$|R
