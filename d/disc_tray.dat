5|$|The Sega CD {{received}} several variations during its lifetime, of which Sega constructed three. The original model utilized a front-loading motorized <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> and sat underneath the Genesis. Sega later released the second {{model of the}} Sega CD, which was redesigned {{to sit next to}} the Genesis console and featured a top-loading <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> in place of the motorized tray of the original model. In addition to the add-on models, Sega also released the Genesis CDX (Multi-Mega in Europe). This console was a combination of the Genesis and Sega CD in one unit and initially retailed at US$399. Unique to this model was its additional functionality as a portable compact disc player.|$|E
5|$|Sega {{would go}} on to release the add-on's second model, the Sega CD 2 (Mega-CD 2), on April 23, 1993 in Japan at a price of JP¥29,800, It was {{released}} in North America several months later at the reduced retail price of US$229, with one of the system's best-selling games, Sewer Shark, as a pack-in. Designed to bring down the manufacturing costs of the Sega CD, the newer model is smaller and does not contain the motorized <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> used in the initial model. A limited number of games were also later developed that utilized both the Sega CD and the 32X add-ons, the latter of which was released in November 1994.|$|E
25|$|A CD is read by {{focusing}} a 780nm wavelength (near infrared) semiconductor laser housed within the CD player, through {{the bottom of}} the polycarbonate layer. The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected. By measuring the intensity change with a photodiode, the data can be read from the disc. In order to accommodate the spiral pattern of data, the semiconductor laser is placed on a swing arm within the <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> of any CD player. This swing arm allows the laser to read information from the centre {{to the edge of a}} disc, without having to interrupt the spinning of the disc itself.|$|E
50|$|The cover art for Talk to the Hand: Live in Michigan is in {{the same}} style as that of Barenaked Ladies Are Me / Barenaked Ladies Are Men and its related merchandise, and was {{designed}} by Team Macho. The products are sold in eco-friendly packaging composed of 100% post-consumer recycled products, printed with vegetable inks, and wrapped with Bi-Ax transparent film. The <b>disc</b> <b>trays</b> of the DVD-only version are made of PaperFoam, which is produced from potato or tapioca starches, while the CD/DVD combo package contains the discs and booklet in cardboard pockets.|$|R
2500|$|Tech media website CNET gave new Super Slim 4 out of 5 stars ("Excellent"), saying [...] "The Super Slim PlayStation 3 shrinks a {{powerful}} gaming machine into an even tinier package {{while maintaining the}} same features as its predecessors: a great gaming library and a strong array of streaming services [...] ", whilst also criticising the [...] "cheap" [...] design and disc-loader, stating: [...] "Sometimes [...] doesn't catch {{and you feel like}} you're using one of those old credit card imprinter machines.

5000|$|Double disc albums {{can either}} be {{packaged}} in standard-thickness jewel cases with hinged media trays which can be lifted to reveal the second <b>disc</b> (<b>trays</b> hinged on the left are known as [...] "Smart Tray" [...] format; those hinged on the right are known as [...] "Brilliant Box" [...] format) or in a [...] "double jewel case", sometimes called a multi-CD jewel case, [...] "fatbox" [...] or [...] "Bookbox", which is slightly larger than two normal jewel cases stacked {{on top of each}} other, and can hold 2 to 6 CDs. Double jewel cases do not fit in some CD racks; however, some racks have a few extra wide slots specifically to accommodate them.|$|R
500|$|The {{album was}} issued {{in a clear}} jewel box with a die-cut {{cardboard}} O-card. It included sixteen pages, which fold {{out to be a}} poster, which displays the cover art. Both the disc and the <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> feature — as described by Chris Morris — an [...] "image reflective of the mania displayed by the group's fans, and exemplary of American frequently deployed shock tactics: a kid carving the band's name into his arms with a scalpel." [...] Mike Bone from American Recordings said that [...] "we captured this not only by photography, but with video — him actually doing it." [...] The front cover was painted and designed by Wes Benscoter, an American artist who would later paint the covers for the other Slayer releases Undisputed Attitude and Live Intrusion. The album sleeve features for the second time the backronym Satan Laughs As You Eternally Rot. This phrase was first used on the vinyl edition of the album Show No Mercy where it was carved into the runout groove of the record.|$|E
2500|$|In {{comparison}} to the PSP-2000, the PSP-3000 (marketed in PAL areas as PSP Slim & Lite, or [...] "PSP Brite" [...] (with enhanced screen + built in microphone) [...] and still marketed as PSP in North America and Japan) has an improved LCD screen featuring an increased color range, five times the contrast ratio, half the pixel response time to reduce ghosting and blurring effects, new sub-pixel structure, and anti-reflective technology to improve outdoor playability. The <b>disc</b> <b>tray,</b> logos, and buttons have all been redesigned and the system now has a microphone. In addition, all games may now be output by component or composite using the video out cable.|$|E
2500|$|An e-mail sent {{to people}} who had signed up to The Mars Volta's {{newsletter}} on May 16 confirmed details of the album and provided a link streaming four songs ("Since We've Been Wrong," [...] "Cotopaxi," [...] "With Twilight as My Guide," [...] and [...] "Desperate Graves") upon inserting one of the band's four previous studio albums into the <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> of the user's computer. The promotion also provided {{a chance to win}} a pair of tickets to their show at the ICA, London on June 18 and a link to pre-order the digipack, limited edition of the album exclusive to HMV. Also, an interactive website was launched, which featured [...] "Since We've Been Wrong" [...] and [...] "Cotopaxi", as well as their lyrics, and several pictures of Rodriguez-Lopez and Bixler-Zavala.|$|E

Whether it was to cut costs or save space, this move is ultimately a step back."The criticism also was due to price, stating the cheapest Super Slim model was still more expensive than the cheapest Slim model, and that the smaller size and bigger hard drive shouldn't be considered an upgrade when the hard drive on a Slim model is easily removed and replaced. They did praise that the hard drive of the Super Slim model is [...] "the easiest yet. Simply sliding off the side panel reveals the drive bay, which can quickly be unscrewed."They also stated that whilst the Super Slim model is not in any way an upgrade, it could be an indicator as to what's to come. [...] "It may not be revolutionary, but the Super Slim PS3 is the same impressive machine in a much smaller package. There doesn't seem to be any reason for existing PS3 owners to upgrade, but for the prospective PS3 buyer, the Super Slim is probably the way to go if you can deal with not having a slot-loading disc drive." ...|$|R
5000|$|Daydream Nations title {{came from}} a lyric in the song [...] "Hyperstation". Sonic Youth had also {{considered}} the title [...] "Tonight's the Day", from a lyric in [...] "Candle", which made reference to Neil Young's 1975 album Tonight's the Night. The cover for Daydream Nation features the 1983 Gerhard Richter painting Kerze ("Candle"). The back cover art is a similar Richter painting from 1982. The vinyl version's four sides and the compact <b>disc</b> inner <b>tray</b> contain four symbols representing the {{four members of the}} band, presumably in a homage to - and a parody of - the symbols used for the band on the fourth Led Zeppelin album. The symbols are infinity, female, upper case omega and a drawing of a demon/angel holding drumsticks.|$|R
50|$|Irregularly shaped, non-rotationally-symmetric discs with an offset {{center of}} mass may also cause {{damaging}} vibration if played in computer CD drives, which can operate {{at a much higher}} rotational velocity than stand-alone audio CD players. Some irregularly shaped <b>discs</b> work with <b>tray</b> loading CD drives if they include a circular ridge on their underside that centers them {{on the part of the}} tray designed to hold 80 mm CDs, if the tray has such a feature.|$|R
2500|$|This is {{the first}} season release {{following}} the series of five Simpson family member shaped boxes. The character-themed packaging continues and, as with those seasons, this set was released in two different packagings: A [...] "Collector's Edition" [...] plastic packaging molded to look like Krusty the Clown's head, and a smaller standard rectangular cardboard box featuring Krusty. Unlike the previous seasons, the Collector's Edition packaging is a removable molded face attached to a cardboard sleeve, {{as opposed to a}} fully plastic clamshell. Both versions have changed from a digipak style of <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> in previous seasons, to an accordion-style series of cardboard sleeves into which the discs slide. Following the release of the set, {{there were a number of}} complaints regarding the style of packaging due to the fact that the cardboard packaging may scratch the discs; David Lambert of TVShowsOnDVD.com described the set as [...] "functionally defective." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{system was}} first {{conceived}} in 2008, after Nintendo recognized several limitations and challenges with the Wii, {{such as the}} general public's perception that the system catered primarily to a [...] "casual" [...] audience. With Wii U, Nintendo wished to bring back [...] "core" [...] gamers. Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto admitted {{that the lack of}} HD and limited network infrastructure for Wii also contributed to the system being regarded in a separate class to its competitors' systems, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was decided that a new console would have to be developed to accommodate significant structural changes. Ideas on which direction to take for the new console led to a lot of debate within the company, and the project started over from scratch on several occasions. The concept of a touchscreen embedded within the controller was originally inspired by the blue light on the Wii <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> that illuminates to indicate new messages. Miyamoto and his team wanted to include a small screen to provide game feedback and status messages to players (similar to the VMU for Sega's Dreamcast). Much later in development, this was expanded to a full screen that could display the game being played in its entirety, a concept which was suggested but not financially viable earlier in the project.|$|E
5000|$|Although less {{vulnerable}} to cracking than a jewel case, the <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> inside the package (particularly the [...] "teeth" [...] of the hub which secure the disc in place) remains rather brittle and is prone to cracking if the package is crushed. The <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> can become detached if handled or stored improperly.|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{of optical}} {{properties}} and surface characterization of paint <b>discs</b> on selected <b>tray</b> clamps {{were carried out}} and are reported. Analysis shows the loss of organic binder for those specimens exposed to atomic oxygen. A visibly darkened layer up to 2 microns thick exists on the outer surfaces of specimens exposed only to solar radiation. Properties of ground control specimens and flight control specimens, {{as a function of}} spacecraft location are reported. Representative examples from a photomicrograph survey and SEM examination are shown...|$|R
50|$|Shaped CDs are not {{compatible}} with all CD players. They work with most machines where the disc is inserted by manually clipping {{it onto a}} spindle (the mechanism in virtually all portable CD players), but may not work in drives that load the <b>disc</b> from a <b>tray</b> {{and they are not}} {{compatible with}} any slot loading drives. They can even get stuck in these players or be rejected if the tray loading mechanism has optical sensors to detect the disc position.|$|R
50|$|The game {{consists}} of a vertical board with five slotted dials on each side. Each player starts with ten numbered tokens or discs {{at the top of}} the board. The object of the game is to move the discs to the bottom of the board by turning the dials. Players alternate turns moving the dials and cannot move a dial that their opponent has just moved. The winner is the first player to move all of their <b>discs</b> into the <b>tray</b> at the bottom. An advanced version of the rules dictates that the discs arrive in the tray in numerical order.|$|R

50|$|The {{album was}} reissued on CD and LP formats by Three One G in 2003, after being out-of-print for years. Both CD {{editions of the}} album came {{packaged}} in red-tinted trays, the only difference being that the original 1995 CD issue also had a glittered grey <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> while the 2003 reissue had a clear black <b>disc</b> <b>tray.</b> Although the album faced negative reception {{when it was first}} released, it is now seen as the band's best recording by critics.|$|E
50|$|Other {{features}} of the Q include a backlit LCD, a front-loading slot <b>disc</b> <b>tray,</b> an optical sound output supporting Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS, a separate subwoofer jack, and a stainless steel chassis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{title track}} is only {{included}} on digital {{editions of the}} album; it is not included on physical editions, as it is Mariah reading what is printed beneath the <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> of the jewel case.|$|E
50|$|The audio CD {{portion of}} the album is {{contained}} within a <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> {{at the back of}} the 56-page book, which has similar dimensions to and is only slightly larger than a standard CD jewel case.|$|E

50|$|The small PlayStation logo on {{the front}} of the <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> could be rotated 90 degrees, in order for the logo to be the right way up in both {{vertical}} and horizontal console orientations. This feature is also used on slimline consoles.|$|E
50|$|Apple added a PowerPC G4 chip to the iBook line on October 23, 2003, finally ending Apple’s {{use of the}} PowerPC G3 chip.

50|$|There are two {{different}} models of the DVD remote control released, which only had minor differences. The first released is the SCPH-10150. The second, SCPH-10420, is functionally and visually the identical apart from the addition of eject and reset/power buttons. However the eject button will only work on PS2 models SCPH-100xx to -500xx, as the slimline PlayStation 2 models had no motorized <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> to eject.|$|E
50|$|The Panasonic Q (sometimes {{known as}} Q and GameQ) is a hybrid {{version of the}} GameCube with a DVD player {{manufactured}} by Panasonic in cooperation with Nintendo. The system was officially released only in Japan. A feature of its main competitors Xbox and PlayStation 2, the GameCube lacked commercial DVD movie playback functionality due {{to the use of}} the Nintendo optical discs format for games and the correspondingly small <b>disc</b> <b>tray.</b> The Q system was licensed by Nintendo and released on December 13, 2001 and listed at US$439.|$|E
5000|$|The {{packaging}} for Ænima {{was nominated}} for the Grammy Award for Best Recording Package. North American pressings of the album were packaged in a custom lenticular jewel case (called a [...] "Multi-Image CD case" [...] in the liner notes) for the cover and interior <b>disc</b> <b>tray.</b> The cover art and other images in the liner notes can be set behind the lenticular [...] "lens" [...] to create an effect of sequential animation. European pressings of the CD featured a standard case, and the insert contained a catalog of sixteen humorously titled [...] "other albums available by Tool".|$|E

5000|$|The PlayStation 4 {{uses the}} PlayStation Dynamic Menu as its {{graphical}} shell, {{in contrast to}} the XrossMediaBar (XMB) used by the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3, as well as the LiveArea used by the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation TV. It is named [...] "Dynamic Menu" [...] because the options it offers to players are context sensitive, changing based on what a player is actually doing with their PlayStation 4 at any given time. This makes navigation simpler than the previous iteration. This dynamic menu can alter itself so that there's as little time as possible between the users placing a game in the <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> and the actual gameplay beginning.|$|E
5000|$|With {{reference}} to the top photo, just {{to the right of}} image center is the disc motor, a metal cylinder, with a gray centering hub and black rubber drive ring on top. There is a disc-shaped round clamp, loosely held inside the cover and free to rotate; it's not in the photo. After the <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> stops moving inward, as the motor and its attached parts rise, a magnet {{near the top of the}} rotating assembly contacts and strongly attracts the clamp to hold and center the disc. This motor is an [...] "outrunner"-style brushless DC motor which has an external rotor - every visible part of it spins.|$|E

It {{comes with a}} British special forces avatar for both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, {{as well as a}} Brady strategy guide. On September 3, 2011, Activision and Microsoft jointly announced a special, limited Modern Warfare 3 version of the Xbox 360 with a 320GB hard disk. The unit is designed by the Call of Duty team and includes two custom wireless controllers, a copy of Modern Warfare 3 and features custom sounds when the console is turned on/off or when the <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> is ejected. A one-month subscription to Xbox Live Gold is also included, as well as exclusive avatar items.|$|E
50|$|Sega {{would go}} on to release the add-on's second model, the Sega CD 2 (Mega-CD 2), on April 23, 1993 in Japan at a price of JP¥29,800, It was {{released}} in North America several months later at the reduced retail price of US$229, with one of the system's best-selling games, Sewer Shark, as a pack-in. Designed to bring down the manufacturing costs of the Sega CD, the newer model is smaller and does not contain the motorized <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> used in the initial model. A limited number of games were also later developed that utilized both the Sega CD and the 32X add-ons, the latter of which was released in November 1994.|$|E
5000|$|Almost at {{the same}} time the Xbox 360 was {{released}} in late 2005, customers began reporting circumferential scratches found on discs used in their Xbox 360 consoles. Almost two years later, in February 2007, the Web site [...] "The Llamma's Adventures" [...] investigated the matter and concluded that some Xbox 360 disc drives lack a mechanism to secure the disc solidly in place. Tilting or moving consoles with these drives, when operating with a disc spinning inside, can potentially cause damage to the disc and in some cases rendering the disc unplayable as a result. Discs have also been scratched by stationary consoles during normal use. One side of the disc can also be scratched by the <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> if it malfunctions by closing with the disc in an odd position. Also, technical engineers already knew about the problem before release confirm this with Microsoft with a list of solutions. According to Microsoft, decreasing the disc rotation would cause games to take too much time to load from the disc, and adding a bumper in the <b>disc</b> <b>tray</b> would cost 25 cents per console—a total of about 11 million dollars and causing a delay of the Xbox 360 release. In 2005, they were accused of many technical Xbox 360 problems and a poor lack of solutions and warranty. According to reports in news media, the new Xbox 360 S design still scratches discs when the console is moved while spinning in operation. However, the Xbox 360 S and Xbox 360 E ships with a sticker informing users that moving the console while powered on poses risks, effectively removing responsibility from Microsoft.|$|E
