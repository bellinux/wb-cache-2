5|$|Once {{the prison}} {{came under the}} control of the colonial government, it was renamed Fremantle Prison. All prisoners in Perth Gaol were {{transferred}} to Fremantle, and from 1887 female prisoners were also imprisoned there. The women were initially held in the <b>hospital</b> <b>building,</b> and then in their own walled-off section of the prison, with cells in the kitchen and wash house buildings. The women were tasked with washing and mending prisoners' clothing, which was considered hard work.|$|E
40|$|Fire {{safety is}} {{important}} specifically in <b>hospital’s</b> <b>building.</b> Evacuation during <b>hospital</b> fire {{is a complex}} phenomenon due to restriction of the movement capability of the patient. This paper explored the criteria and attributes for identifying the current fire safety conditions in a <b>hospital’s</b> <b>building.</b> All design criteria were extracted from the past literature as well as relevant acts to produce observational instrument. Preliminary survey (observation) done by inspection to the building and was carried out with officer from the <b>hospital’s</b> <b>building.</b> The observational instrument was analyses using qualitative method. The results found that {{only one out of}} three <b>hospital’s</b> <b>building</b> allocate the refuge area in the <b>hospital’s</b> <b>building.</b> Other than that, the recommendations has been generalized which could help in improving the safety level of means of escape in <b>hospital’s</b> <b>building...</b>|$|R

Throughout the remainder of the 1920s, Silverman served as vice president of the Zionist Organization of America and vice chair of the <b>hospital</b> <b>building</b> fund for the Hebrew University. In addition to her national organizational work, Silverman was vice president of the New England Zionist Region, the New England Conference of Hadassah, and an honorary president of the Hadassah Organization in Providence. She is the only woman to have served as vice president of the Zionist Organization of America and the American Jewish Congress.|$|E
5|$|Nearby is {{the former}} site of St. Mary's (Whitechapel Road) tube station. It opened in March 1884 but its close {{proximity}} to both Whitechapel and Aldgate East tube stations made it superfluous, leading to its closure in April 1938. It {{was used as an}} air raid shelter in the Second World War, but was destroyed by bombing in 1940. Opposite to the south {{is the former}} Royal London <b>Hospital</b> <b>building,</b> built in 1740. The hospital suffered significant structural damage during the Second World War, but much of the 18th and 19th centuries architecture still remains. A new building now sits adjacent to the original.|$|E

5|$|He {{relocated}} {{to the town}} of Edmonton in 1892, becoming the town's first architect. He also operated a brickyard upon settling. In 1892, Edmiston, working independently at the time, was contracted by the Edmonton Town Council to draft a map of the town. In that same year, he was also a member of a committee tasked with a project to establish a brewery in Edmonton. In 1893, he established a partnership with local architect Nathaniel G. Flater, and operated under the name Edmiston & Flater, headquartered at the Edmonton Imperial Bank Building. The firm designed many notable buildings for the town, including the first post office, the city's first brick school (for the Edmonton Public School District), the All Saints' Anglican Cathedral, a home for Herbert Charles Wilson, the McDougall & Secord retail store, and a fire hall. In 1899, he would end his partnership with Flater and enter into a new one, with Henry D. Johnson of Calgary, under the firm name Edmiston & Johnson Architects, Draughtsmen, Valuators and Insurance Agents. This firm was responsible for constructing, amongst many, a <b>hospital</b> <b>building,</b> a new Presbyterian church and making alterations to the Robertson Hall Theatre.|$|E

He then races to Gognitti's hideout to save him from Lem, and the two flee to Mona's funhouse hoping that she can help them, but Lem ambushes them. He reveals that Mona is a hired gun for Woden, with orders to kill Lem and Max. Lem murders Gognitti, shoots Max and leaves him for dead. Mona rescues Max, and together, they go to Woden's mansion to save him from Lem.|$|E
5|$|The building, {{designed}} by James Lewis was the former Bethlem Royal Hospital {{which had been}} vacated following the hospital's relocation to Beckenham in Kent. The site was owned by Lord Rothermere, who had originally intended to demolish the building entirely {{in order to provide}} a public park in what was a severely overcrowded area of London. Eventually the central portion of the <b>hospital</b> <b>building</b> was retained while its two extensive wings were removed and the resulting space named Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, after Lord Rothermere's mother. Sir Martin Conway described the building as '...a fine building, really quite noble building, with a great portico, a distinguishing dome, and two great wings added to it for the accommodation of lunatics no longer required. This particular building can be made to contain our collection admirably, and we shall preserve from destruction quite a fine building which otherwise will disappear'. The 'distinguishing dome' was added by Sydney Smirke in 1846 and housed the hospital's chapel. The museum was reopened by the Duke of York (later King George VI) in its new accommodation on 7 July 1936.|$|E

5|$|To {{the north}} of the central campus area, along Columbia Road, sits the School of Medicine complex. The main School of Medicine {{building}} is the remodeled St. Michael's <b>Hospital</b> <b>building</b> which was built in 1951. Other buildings in the medical school complex include the Biomedical Research Center and the Neuroscience Research Facility. Further north sits an area that is called University Village. This land sat virtually empty for decades, but has recently been developed for UND, commercial, and residential purposes. University Village is anchored by the $100 million Ralph Engelstad Arena, which is used by the men's and women's hockey teams. University Village is also home to the Betty Engelstad Sioux Center, the new Student Wellness Center, university apartments, the UND bookstore, a medical clinic, and several residential and commercial properties.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} <b>hospital</b> <b>building</b> is now largely {{occupied by}} corporate offices. The 1966 extension houses the library, art store, and document archives while the 1980s redevelopments created exhibition space over five floors. The first stage created 8,000m2 of gallery space of which 4,600m2 was new, {{and the second}} provided a further 1,600m2. The final phase, the Southwest Infill, was partly funded by a £12.6 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and provided 5,860m2 of gallery space and educational facilities over six floors. Before the 2013-14 redevelopment, the basement was occupied by permanent galleries on the First and Second World Wars, and of conflicts after 1945. The ground floor comprised the atrium, cinema, temporary exhibition spaces, and visitor facilities. The first floor included the atrium mezzanine, education facilities, and a permanent gallery, Secret War, exploring special forces, espionage and covert operations. The second floor included the atrium viewing balcony, two art galleries, a temporary exhibition area and the permanent Crimes against Humanity exhibition. The third floor housed the permanent Holocaust Exhibition, and the fourth floor, a vaulted roof space, accommodated the Lord Ashcroft Gallery. Opened in November 2010 the gallery exhibits the museum's Victoria Cross (VC) and George Cross collection, alongside the private VC collection amassed by Michael Ashcroft, 241 medals in total.|$|E

25|$|The still {{standing}} stone-arched gateway, also constructed in 1865, greeted the migrants {{when they entered}} the complex.

Of these, only the gatekeeper's office and surgery room have survived, while archaeological remains {{of the kitchen and}} privies have been found. The remnant of the <b>hospital</b> <b>building</b> received a new roof installation in 2000. The use of modern materials however has been questioned by preservation groups.|$|E
