25|$|The unsized {{oat groats}} {{pass through a}} heat and {{moisture}} treatment to balance moisture, but mainly to stabilize them. Oat groats are high in fat (lipids) and once removed from their protective hulls and exposed to air, enzymatic (lipase) activity begins {{to break down the}} fat into free fatty acids, ultimately causing an off-flavour or rancidity. Oats begin to show signs of enzymatic rancidity within four days of being <b>dehulled</b> if not stabilized. This process is primarily done in food-grade plants, not in feed-grade plants. Groats are not considered raw if they have gone through this process; the heat disrupts the germ and they cannot sprout.|$|E

The <b>dehuller</b> principally consists of two concentric cylinders, a power transmission shaft and a prime mover. The space between the two cylinders constitutes the <b>dehulling</b> chamber. After design and construction, the <b>dehuller</b> was evaluated based on three parameters, namely moisture content of beans, length of the <b>dehulling</b> head and the speed of rotation of the inner cylinder. Tests showed that efficiency of the machine increased linearly with increases in all the three parameters. The throughput of the <b>dehuller</b> decreased with increases in moisture content and length of <b>dehulling</b> head, but increased with increase in <b>dehulling</b> speed.

50|$|Husking of corn is {{the process}} of {{removing}} its outer layers, leaving only the cob or seed rack of the corn. <b>Dehulling</b> {{is the process}} of removing the hulls (or chaff) from beans and other seeds. This is sometimes done using a machine known as a huller. To prepare the seeds to have oils extracted from them, they are cleaned to remove any foreign objects. Next, the seeds have their hulls, or outer coverings, or husk, removed. There are three different types of <b>dehulling</b> systems {{that can be used to}} process soybeans: Hot <b>dehulling,</b> warm <b>dehulling</b> and cold <b>dehulling.</b> Hot <b>dehulling</b> is the system offered in areas where beans are processed directly from the field. Warm <b>dehulling</b> is often used by processors who import their soybeans. Cold <b>dehulling</b> is used in plants that have existing drying and conditioning equipment, but need to add <b>dehulling</b> equipment to produce high protein meal. The different <b>dehulling</b> temperature options are for different types of production, beans and preparation equipment.|$|R

This study was to evaluate {{the performance of a}} developed rice dehusking/destoning machine at Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria. Minitab 16 was used for analysis of variance of two main factors [four paddy varieties Faro 35, Faro 44, Faro 55 and Ofada and five moisture content (MC) groups] to obtain its optimum operational parameters.

40|$|The {{drudgery}} {{involved in}} <b>dehulling</b> breadfruit seed by traditional methods has been highlighted {{as one of}} the major problems hindering the realization of the full potential of breadfruit as a field to food material. This paper describes a development in an African breadfruit seed <b>dehulling</b> machine with increased throughput of about 70 % above reported machines. The machine consists of a 20 mm diameter shaft, carrying a spiral wound around its circumference (feeder). The feeder provides the required rotational motion and turns a circular disk that rotates against a fixed disk. The two disks can be adjusted to maintain a pre-determined gap for <b>dehulling.</b> An inbuilt drying unit reduces the moisture content of the breadfruit for easy separation of the cotyledon from the endosperm immediately after the <b>dehulling</b> process. The sifting unit that separates the shell from the seed is achieved in this design with an electric fan. The machine is design to run at a speed of 250 rpm with an electric motor as the prime mover. The <b>dehulling</b> efficiency up to 86 % and breakage of less than 1. 3 % was obtained at a clearance setting of 12. 4 mm between disks. A sifting efficiency of 100 % was achieved.
