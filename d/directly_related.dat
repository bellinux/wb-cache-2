5|$|As {{the only}} stable {{long-term}} state in Europe during the Middle Ages, Byzantium isolated Western Europe from newly emerging {{forces to the}} East. Constantly under attack, it distanced Western Europe from Persians, Arabs, Seljuk Turks, and for a time, the Ottomans. From a different perspective, since the 7th century, the evolution and constant reshaping of the Byzantine state were <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> to the respective progress of Islam.|$|E

5|$|In all, about 15,000 damage {{claims were}} filed across Réunion, {{with a total}} of 3,251 homes damaged and about 850 {{condemned}} or destroyed. Property damage from the storm amounted to €95 million (US$83.4 million). Collectively, losses on the island were estimated at €200 million (US$190 million). Although there were no fatalities <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> to the storm, six people died in various events indirectly caused by Dina.|$|E
5|$|Putnam {{has contributed}} to {{scientific}} fields not <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> to his work in philosophy. As a mathematician, Putnam contributed to the resolution of Hilbert's tenth problem in mathematics. This problem was settled by Yuri Matiyasevich in 1970, with a proof that relied heavily on previous research by Putnam, Julia Robinson and Martin Davis.|$|E
5|$|St. Elmo was a {{financial}} success, reported by The Photoplayers' Weekly as breaking box office records. The following year, Bertram Bracken directed a film adaptation of another Augusta Jane Evans novel, Beulah (1859), for Balboa. Though not <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> to St. Elmo, the 1915 Beulah film was marketed as a sequel. In 1923, Fox Film produced another {{adaptation of the}} novel, also titled St. Elmo, which was also a success.|$|E

5|$|The Khap panchayat's {{ruling was}} based on the {{assumption}} that Manoj and Babli belonged to the Banwala gotra, a Jat community, and were therefore considered to be siblings despite not being <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> and any union between them would be invalid and incestuous. Nevertheless, the couple went ahead with their marriage, following which they were abducted and killed by Babli's relatives.|$|E

5|$|The genus {{name was}} changed to Glyptemys in 2001. The bog turtle and the wood turtle, Glyptemys insculpta, had until then been {{included}} in the genus Clemmys, which also included spotted turtles (C.guttata) and western pond turtles (C.marmorata). Nucleotide sequencing and ribosomal DNA analyses suggested that bog turtles and wood turtles are closely related, but neither is <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> to spotted turtles, hence the separation of the genus Glyptemys.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} did affect German {{analysis of}} Allied troop strength. In early 1944 the Allies had 38 {{divisions in the}} region, but the German battle plan identified up to 71. Whether <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> to Zeppelin or not, German forces remained in the Mediterranean throughout May 1944, and so were not available to reinforce Normandy in June.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the staff}} that created the game later became the {{founding}} members of the visual novel brand Key.

A novel based on the game written by Midori Tateyama was released in July 1998 by Movic. The game's original soundtrack was released bundled with Dōseis soundtrack in August 2000 at Comiket 58; Dōsei was Tactics' first game. Moon has been referenced in other media not <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> to the game, such as in Tactics' third game , and in the second anime adaptation of Key's first game Kanon.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Hurricane Katrina killed 14people in the state, {{of which}} 6 were <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> to the storm. Six of the {{indirect}} deaths were in South Florida, of which three were from {{carbon monoxide poisoning}} caused by generators, one was due to a vehicle accident, one occurred during debris cleanup, and one {{was associated with a}} lack of electricity. At least five people were injured due to carbon monoxide poisoning. Overall damage totaled $623million (2005USD).|$|E
5|$|Reviewing {{the book}}, Charles E. Osgood {{classified}} {{the book as}} a graduate-level text based more on objective facts than on theoretical constructs. He thought the book was verbose on some topics and too brief on others not <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> to the author's expertise area. He was also critical of Miller's use of simple, Skinnerian single-stage stimulus-response learning to explain human language acquisition and use. This approach, per Osgood, {{made it impossible to}} analyze the concept of meaning, and the idea of language consisting of representational signs. He did find the book objective in its emphasis on facts over theory, and depicting clearly application of information theory to psychology.|$|E

5|$|Several {{relativistic}} {{effects are}} <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> to the relativity of direction. One is geodetic precession: the axis {{direction of a}} gyroscope in free fall in curved spacetime will change when compared, for instance, with the direction of light received from distant stars—even though such a gyroscope represents the way of keeping a direction as stable as possible ("parallel transport"). For the Moon–Earth system, this effect has been measured {{with the help of}} lunar laser ranging. More recently, it has been measured for test masses aboard the satellite Gravity Probe B to a precision of better than 0.3%.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} {{brightness of}} a star is {{expressed in terms of}} its apparent magnitude. It {{is a function of the}} star's luminosity, its distance from Earth, and the altering of the star's light as it passes through Earth's atmosphere. Intrinsic or absolute magnitude is <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> to a star's luminosity, and is what the apparent magnitude a star would be if the distance between the Earth and the star were 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years).|$|E
5|$|The {{comparison}} of coral strontium/calcium minimums with sea surface temperature maximums, data recorded from , {{time can be}} correlated to coral strontium/calcium and δ18O variations. To confirm accuracy of the annual relationship between Sr/Ca and δ18O variations, a perceptible association to annual coral growth rings confirms the age conversion. Geochronology is established by the blending of Sr/Ca data, growth rings, and stable isotope data. El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is <b>directly</b> <b>related</b> to climate fluctuations that influence coral δ18O ratio from local salinity variations associated with {{the position of the}} South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) and can be used for ENSO modeling.|$|E
