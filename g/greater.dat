5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum can be {{separated}} from the morphologically similar individuals of A.aleuticum by the <b>greater</b> length of the stalks on the medial ultimate segments and of the false indusia, measuring <b>greater</b> than 0.9mm and <b>greater</b> than 3.5mm, respectively, in A.viridimontanum. Spore size is also a useful character (although not easily measured in the field); the average A.viridimontanum spore measures 51.4μm in diameter. While A.aleuticum spores can reach up to 53μm, they average about 43μm. In A.aleuticum growing as a disjunct on eastern serpentine (the specimens most likely to be confused with A.viridimontanum), the rhizome is much more frequently branched, with intervals of 1.0 to 2.0mm between nodes.|$|E
