5|$|A deck {{decompression}} chamber {{is intended}} for surface decompression and emergency <b>hyperbaric</b> treatment of divers, but {{can be used for}} other <b>hyperbaric</b> treatment under the appropriate supervision of <b>hyperbaric</b> medical personnel.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hyperbaric</b> oxygen is {{also used}} in the {{treatment}} of carbon monoxide poisoning, as it may hasten dissociation of CO from carboxyhemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase {{to a greater extent than}} normal oxygen. <b>Hyperbaric</b> oxygen at three times atmospheric pressure reduces the half life of carbon monoxide to 23 (~80/3 minutes) minutes, compared to 80 minutes for oxygen at regular atmospheric pressure. It may also enhance oxygen transport to the tissues by plasma, partially bypassing the normal transfer through hemoglobin. However, it is controversial whether <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen actually offers any extra benefits over normal high flow oxygen, in terms of increased survival or improved long-term outcomes. There have been randomized controlled trials in which the two treatment options have been compared; of the six performed, four found <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen improved outcome and two found no benefit for <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen. Some of these trials have been criticized for apparent flaws in their implementation. A review of all the literature on carbon monoxide poisoning treatment concluded that the role of <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen is unclear and the available evidence neither confirms nor denies a medically meaningful benefit. The authors suggested a large, well designed, externally audited, multicentre trial to compare normal oxygen with <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen.|$|E
5|$|The medical {{aspects of}} diving and <b>hyperbaric</b> {{exposure}} include examination of divers to establish medical fitness to dive, {{diagnosis and treatment}} of diving disorders, treatment by recompression and <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen therapy, toxic effects of gases in a <b>hyperbaric</b> environment, and treatment of injuries incurred while diving which are not directly associated with depth or pressure.|$|E
5|$|A <b>hyperbaric</b> {{lifeboat}} or <b>hyperbaric</b> {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if the platform is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. A <b>hyperbaric</b> lifeboat may be self-propelled and can be operated by crew while the while the occupants are under pressure. It must be self-sufficient for several days at sea, {{in case of a}} delay in rescue due to sea conditions. The crew would normally start decompression as soon as possible after launching.|$|E

5|$|Diving {{medicine}} is the diagnosis, treatment {{and prevention of}} conditions caused by exposing divers to the underwater environment. It includes the effects {{on the body of}} pressure on gases, the diagnosis and treatment of conditions caused by marine hazards and how fitness to dive affects a diver's safety. <b>Hyperbaric</b> {{medicine is}} another field associated with diving, since recompression in a <b>hyperbaric</b> chamber with <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen therapy is the definitive treatment for two of the most important diving-related illnesses, DCS and arterial gas embolism.|$|E
5|$|The descent, bottom {{time and}} ascent are sectors {{common to all}} dives and <b>hyperbaric</b> exposures.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hyperbaric</b> {{oxygen therapy}} (HBO) has been {{evaluated}} as an add on treatment following TBI. The {{findings of a}} 2012 Cochrane systematic review does not justify the routine use of <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen therapy to treat people recovering from a traumatic brain injury. This review also reported {{that only a small}} number of randomized controlled trials had been conducted at the time of the review, many of which had methodological problems and poor reporting. HBO for TBI is controversial with further evidence required to determine if it has a role.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, {{altitude}} {{decompression sickness}} was first treated with <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen. and the revised US Navy Decompression Tables {{were published in}} 1956.|$|E
5|$|M.P. Spencer {{showed that}} Doppler {{ultrasonic}} methods can detect venous bubbles in asymptomatic divers, and Dr Andrew Pilmanis showed that safety stops reduced bubble formation. In 1981 D.E. Yount described the Varying Permeability Model, proposing a mechanism of bubble formation. Several other bubble models followed. The pathophysiology of DCS {{is not yet}} fully understood, but decompression practice has reached a stage where the risk is fairly low, and most incidences are successfully treated by therapeutic recompression and <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen therapy. Mixed breathing gases are used to reduce {{the effects of the}} <b>hyperbaric</b> environment on ambient pressure divers.|$|E
5|$|Divers {{with long}} {{decompression}} obligations may be decompressed inside gas filled <b>hyperbaric</b> chambers {{in the water}} or at the surface, and in the extreme case, saturation divers are only decompressed {{at the end of}} a tour of duty that may be several weeks long.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} {{is caused}} by exposure to oxygen at partial pressures greater than those to which the body is normally exposed. This occurs in three principal settings: underwater diving, <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen therapy, {{and the provision of}} supplemental oxygen, particularly to premature infants. In each case, the risk factors are markedly different.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of oxygen}} as {{treatment}} began in 1868. The use of <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen in rats following poisoning was studied by Haldane in 1895 while {{its use in}} humans began in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Vitamin E and {{selenium}} were {{proposed and}} later rejected {{as a potential}} method of protection against pulmonary oxygen toxicity. There is however some experimental evidence in rats that vitamin E and selenium aid in preventing in vivo lipid peroxidation and free radical damage, and therefore prevent retinal changes following repetitive <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen exposures.|$|E
5|$|A typical <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen {{treatment}} schedule is the US Navy Table 6, which {{provides for a}} standard treatment of 3 to 5 periods of 20 minutes of oxygen breathing at 60fsw (18msw) followed by 2 to 4 periods of 60 minutes at 30fsw (9msw) before surfacing. Air breaks are taken between oxygen breathing {{to reduce the risk}} of oxygen toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Decompression in {{the context}} of diving derives from the {{reduction}} in ambient pressure experienced by the diver during the ascent {{at the end of a}} dive or <b>hyperbaric</b> exposure and refers to both the reduction in pressure and the process of allowing dissolved inert gases to be eliminated from the tissues during this reduction in pressure.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{therapeutic}} decompression {{was done}} by recompressing the diver to the depth of relief of pain, or a bit deeper, maintaining that pressure for a while, so that bubbles could be re-dissolved, and performing a slow decompression {{back to the surface}} pressure. Later air tables were standardised to specific depths, followed by slow decompression. This procedure has been superseded almost entirely by <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen treatment.|$|E
5|$|Hyperoxic myopia has {{occurred}} in closed circuit oxygen rebreather divers with prolonged exposures. It also occurs frequently in those undergoing repeated <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen therapy. This is due {{to an increase in}} the refractive power of the lens, since axial length and keratometry readings do not reveal a corneal or length basis for a myopic shift. It is usually reversible with time.|$|E
5|$|If the {{dissolved}} {{inert gases}} {{come out of}} solution within the tissues {{of the body and}} form bubbles, they may cause the condition known as decompression sickness, or DCS, also known as divers' disease, the bends or caisson disease. However, not all bubbles result in symptoms, and doppler bubble detection shows that venous bubbles are present in a significant number of asymptomatic divers after relatively mild <b>hyperbaric</b> exposures.|$|E
5|$|Immediate {{treatment}} with 100% oxygen, followed by recompression in a <b>hyperbaric</b> chamber, will {{in most cases}} result in no long-term effects. However, permanent long-term injury from DCS is possible. Three-month follow-ups on diving accidents reported to DAN in 1987 showed 14.3% of the 268 divers surveyed had ongoing symptoms of Type II DCS, and 7% from Type I DCS. Long-term follow-ups showed similar results, with 16% having permanent neurological sequelae.|$|E
5|$|Professor A.A. Bühlmann of the Laboratory of <b>Hyperbaric</b> {{medicine}} of the Medical Clinic of the University of Zurich {{developed the}} Swiss tables, more {{often referred to}} as Bühlmann tables, in the early 1960s. The model is Haldanian, with 16 tissue compartments with half-times from 2.65 minutes to 635 minutes, each with linearly varying supersaturation limits depending on the tissue and the ambient pressure, and is based on absolute pressures, which simplifies application to altitude diving.|$|E
5|$|Protocols for {{avoidance}} {{of the effects}} of hyperoxia exist in fields where oxygen is breathed at higher-than-normal partial pressures, including underwater diving using compressed breathing gases, <b>hyperbaric</b> medicine, neonatal care and human spaceflight. These protocols have resulted in the increasing rarity of seizures due to oxygen toxicity, with pulmonary and ocular damage being mainly confined to the problems of managing premature infants.|$|E
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} can cause seizures, brief periods of rigidity followed by convulsions and unconsciousness, and {{is of concern}} to divers who encounter greater than atmospheric pressures. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity results in damage to the lungs, causing pain and difficulty in breathing. Oxidative damage to the eye may lead to myopia or partial detachment of the retina. Pulmonary and ocular damage {{are most likely to}} occur when supplemental oxygen is administered as part of a treatment, particularly to newborn infants, but are also a concern during <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen therapy.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{facilities}} are {{equipped to handle}} TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center. Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate {{blood flow to the}} brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain herniation. Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen therapy to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} {{poisoning}} include carbon monoxide detectors, proper venting of gas appliances, keeping chimneys clean, and keeping exhaust systems of vehicles in good repair. Treatment of poisoning generally consists of giving 100% oxygen along with supportive care. This should generally {{be carried out}} until symptoms are no longer present and the HbCO level is less than 10%. While <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen therapy is used for severe poisonings, the benefit over standard oxygen delivery is unclear. The risk of death among those affected is between 1 and 30%.|$|E
5|$|In {{recreational}} diving terminology, in a {{bounce dive}} the diver descends {{directly to the}} maximum depth, spends very little time at maximum depth and ascends directly to the surface, preferably at an ascent rate recommended by the decompression model used, and making any necessary decompression stops. In commercial diving a bounce dive is any surface oriented dive, in which the diver is decompressed to surface pressure {{at the end of}} the dive and does not transfer to a <b>hyperbaric</b> habitat where the diver lives at pressure between dives and only decompresses at the end of a tour of duty. The duration of bottom time is not relevant in this usage.|$|E
5|$|Jackson gave a 90-minute {{interview}} to Oprah Winfrey on February 10, 1993, his second television interview since 1979. He grimaced when speaking {{of his childhood}} abuse {{at the hands of}} his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought the bones of the Elephant Man, slept in a <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, and stated {{for the first time that}} he had vitiligo. Dangerous re-entered the album chart in the top 10, more than a year after its original release.|$|E
5|$|Over 50% {{of people}} with MS may use {{complementary}} and alternative medicine, although percentages vary depending on how alternative medicine is defined. The evidence for the effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Treatments of unproven benefit used by people with MS include dietary supplementation and regimens, vitamin D, relaxation techniques such as yoga, herbal medicine (including medical cannabis), <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen therapy, self-infection with hookworms, reflexology, acupuncture, and mindfulness. Regarding the characteristics of users, they are more frequently women, have had MS for a longer time, {{tend to be more}} disabled and have lower levels of satisfaction with conventional healthcare.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{mechanisms}} of bubble formation {{and the damage}} they cause {{has been the subject}} of medical research for a considerable time and several hypotheses have been advanced and tested. Tables and algorithms for predicting the outcome of decompression schedules for specified <b>hyperbaric</b> exposures have been proposed, tested, and used, and usually found to be of some use but not entirely reliable. Decompression remains a procedure with some risk, but this has been reduced and is generally considered acceptable for dives within the well-tested range of commercial, military and recreational diving.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{decompression}} sickness after diving {{can be managed}} through effective decompression procedures and contracting it is now uncommon, though it remains to some degree unpredictable. Its potential severity has driven much research to prevent it and divers almost universally use decompression tables or dive computers to limit or monitor their exposure and to control their ascent speed and decompression procedures. If DCS is contracted, it is usually treated by <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen therapy in a recompression chamber. If treated early, there is a significantly higher chance of successful recovery.|$|E
5|$|A mysterious {{recruiter}} approaches Wilson, {{offering an}} experimental cure for his cancer. He {{is taken to}} Ajax and Angel Dust, who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. They then subject him to days of torture to induce stress to trigger any mutation Wade may have, but without success. Wilson discovers Ajax's real name, Francis, and mocks him for it. In response, Ajax leaves Wilson in a <b>hyperbaric</b> chamber that takes him to the verge of asphyxiation periodically over a weekend. It finally activates a superhuman healing ability that cures his cancer, but leaves him severely disfigured with burn-like scars over his entire body. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax, but relents when told that his disfigurement can be cured. Ajax subdues Wilson and leaves him for dead in the burning laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} among patients undergoing <b>hyperbaric</b> oxygen therapy is rare, and {{is influenced by}} a number of a factors: individual sensitivity and treatment protocol; and probably therapy indication and equipment used. A study by Welslau in 1996 reported 16 incidents out of a population of 107,264 patients (0.015%), while Hampson and Atik in 2003 found a rate of 0.03%. Yildiz, Ay and Qyrdedi, in a summary of 36,500 patient treatments between 1996 and 2003, reported only 3 oxygen toxicity incidents, giving a rate of 0.008%. A later review of over 80,000 patient treatments revealed an even lower rate: 0.0024%. The reduction in incidence may be partly due to use of a mask (rather than a hood) to deliver oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Fort Lauderdale {{is served}} by Broward General Medical Center and Imperial Point Medical Center, which are {{operated}} by Broward Health, the third largest hospital consortium in the United States. Broward General is a 716-bed acute care facility which is designated as a Level I trauma center. It {{is also home to}} Chris Evert Children's Hospital and a Heart Center of Excellence. The hospital serves as a major training site for medical students from Nova Southeastern University's College of Osteopathic Medicine, as well as nursing and paramedic programs from throughout the area. Imperial Point Medical Center is a 204-bed facility with a <b>hyperbaric</b> medicine program. Holy Cross Hospital, a 571-bed hospital operated by the Sisters of Mercy, was named by HealthGrades as one of the 50 best hospitals in the country for 2007.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Fringe {{division}} is falsely told that their Olivia has escaped. Agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), still needing <b>hyperbaric</b> treatment to regrow his skin after being burned, and Agent Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) follow a tracking device on Henry's taxi. When {{they arrive at}} the station, Olivia orders Henry to drive away, and manages to fire at a small valve on a gas tank, allowing the explosion to cover their trail. Walternate, watching the altercation on monitors, notes Olivia has gained the marksmanship ability that the alternate Olivia possesses, and begins to think the serum is working. Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes in a later conversation that the rush of adrenaline effectively enhanced the potency of his chemical agents to brainwash Olivia.|$|E
5|$|Preterm newborns {{are known}} to be at higher risk for bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} with extended exposure to high concentrations of oxygen. Other groups at higher risk for oxygen toxicity are patients on mechanical ventilation with exposure to levels of oxygen greater than 50%, and patients exposed to chemicals that increase risk for oxygen toxicity such the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin. Therefore, current guidelines for patients on mechanical ventilation in intensive care recommends keeping oxygen concentration less than 60%. Likewise, divers who undergo treatment of decompression sickness are at increased risk of oxygen toxicity as treatment entails exposure to long periods of oxygen breathing under <b>hyperbaric</b> conditions, in addition to any oxygen exposure during the dive.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to high inspired fractions of oxygen causes {{damage to the}} retina. Damage to the developing eye of infants exposed to high oxygen fraction at normal pressure has a different mechanism and effect from the eye damage experienced by adult divers under <b>hyperbaric</b> conditions. Hyperoxia may be a contributing factor for the disorder called retrolental fibroplasia or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants. In preterm infants, the retina is often not fully vascularised. Retinopathy of prematurity occurs {{when the development of}} the retinal vasculature is arrested and then proceeds abnormally. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a risk factor, is not the main risk factor for development of this disease. Restricting supplemental oxygen use does not necessarily reduce the rate of retinopathy of prematurity, and may raise the risk of hypoxia-related systemic complications.|$|E
