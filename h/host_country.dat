40|$|Abstract: The {{importance}} of {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) for the <b>host</b> <b>countries</b> has been arguable since its emergence. Numerous country-specific and cross-countries {{studies have been conducted}} to investigate the impacts of the FDI on <b>host</b> <b>countries</b> from different angles. Review of empirical evidence may help us enhance our understanding about {{of the effects of the}} FDI on <b>host</b> <b>countries</b> and to develop a framework that may help if not for all but for most of the <b>host</b> <b>countries</b> in capitalizing FDI. This study reviewed the empirical evidence related to the FDI impacts focusing on economic growth and human capital in the <b>host</b> <b>countries.</b> This study would help to understand which assumptions about the FDI are supported robustly by empirical evidence. Moreover, this study points to various directions for further research...|$|R

40|$|FDI促进东道国技术进步的方式一般分为直接技术转移和技术溢出，其中技术溢出效应对东道国技术进步有重要意义。大量的实证检验结果表明，FDI的技术溢出效应在不同国家或地区相差很大。除了研究方法、数据选取和不同国别的选取差异之外，FDI技术溢出效应的发生和程度还取决于该国家或地区的吸收能力。本文认为在影响FDI技术溢出效应的众多因素中，人力资本起到至关重要的作用，人力资本对FDI技术溢出的吸收能力不可忽视。 我国是世界上吸引FDI最多的发展中国家，近年来中国政府本着“以市场换技术”的指导政策积极鼓励FDI的进入，FDI技术溢出效应的作用日益凸现。所以在此时对FDI技术外溢效应进行研究就显得尤为重要 [...] .

40|$|Self-selection plays a {{dominant}} {{role in determining}} the size and composition of immigrant flows. The United States competes with other potential <b>host</b> <b>countries</b> in the "immigration market". <b>Host</b> <b>countries</b> vary in their "offers" of economic opportunities and also differ in the way they ration entry through their immigration policies. Potential immigrants compare the various opportunities and are non-randomly sorted by the immigration market among the various <b>host</b> <b>countries.</b> This paper presents a theoretical and empirical analysis of this marketplace. The theory of immigration presented in this paper describes the way in which immigrants are sorted among <b>host</b> <b>countries</b> in terms of both their observed and unobserved characteristics. The empirical analysis uses Census data from Australia, Canada, and the United States and shows that U. S.

5|$|Nations and {{international}} businesses face {{an array of}} financial risks unique to foreign investment activity. Political risk {{is the potential for}} losses from a foreign country's political instability or otherwise unfavorable developments, which manifests in different forms. Transfer risk emphasizes uncertainties surrounding a country's capital controls and balance of payments. Operational risk characterizes concerns over a country's regulatory policies and their impact on normal business operations. Control risk is born from uncertainties surrounding property and decision rights in the local operation of foreign direct investments. Credit risk implies lenders may face an absent or unfavorable regulatory framework that affords little or no legal protection of foreign investments. For example, foreign governments may commit to a sovereign default or otherwise repudiate their debt obligations to international investors without any legal consequence or recourse. Governments may decide to expropriate or nationalize foreign-held assets or enact contrived policy changes following an investor's decision to acquire assets in the <b>host</b> <b>country.</b> Country risk encompasses both political risk and credit risk, and represents the potential for unanticipated developments in a <b>host</b> <b>country</b> to threaten its capacity for debt repayment and repatriation of gains from interest and dividends.|$|E
