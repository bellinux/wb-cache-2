Some scenes {{included}} photography errors, including one in which light shines through a kitchen window from outside even though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be nighttime. Michel Levesque provided art direction, and the musical score was composed by London Philharmonic Orchestra conductor Arlon Ober.|$|E
5|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the party discipline inspection system mirrors that of the MOS, with the CCDI responsible for cases involving breaches of party discipline and state law by party members. Like the MOS, the CCDI lacks judicial authority and is limited to investigating allegations of corruption and breaches of party discipline. Since the CCDI {{does not have the}} power to prosecute, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> transfer cases (after investigation) to the Supreme People's Procuratorate or the Supreme People's Court. Despite this, its formal jurisdiction is loosely defined. The CDI's ability to begin investigations and administer party sanctions has often led to the slow transfer (or sometimes no transfer) of cases to the Supreme People's Procuratorate.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} extant hymnal {{in which}} it appears is that of Andrew Rauscher (1531), but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have been in Joseph Klug's Wittenberg hymnal of 1529, of which no copy exists. Its title was Der xxxxvi. Psalm. Deus noster refugium et virtus. Before that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> {{have appeared in the}} Hans Weiss Wittenberg hymnal of 1528, also lost. This evidence would support its being written in 1527–1529, since Luther's hymns were printed shortly after they were written.|$|E

25|$|In the {{opposition}} coalition, while Silvio Berlusconi vehemently opposed a D'Alema presidency, {{some of his}} aides, such as Marcello Dell'Utri, and some aligned newspapers, such as Il Foglio, campaigned for D'Alema. However, the official stance of the centre-right was that D'Alema, being an important left-wing politician and having participated in the election campaign, was ill-suited for president, a role that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be impartial.|$|E
25|$|The {{atypical}} clinical syndrome of {{the memory}} disorder (as opposed to organic amnesia) is that a person with psychogenic amnesia is profoundly unable to remember personal information about themselves; {{there is a lack}} of conscious self-knowledge which affects even simple self-knowledge, such as who they are. Psychogenic amnesia is distinguished from organic amnesia in that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> result from a nonorganic cause; no structural brain damage or brain lesion should be evident but some form of psychological stress should precipitate the amnesia, however psychogenic amnesia as a memory disorder is controversial.|$|E

The trio undergo a long journey with many obstacles in their path including Death Eaters, Snatchers, the mysterious Deathly Hallows, and Harry's connection with the Dark Lord's mind becoming ever stronger.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the five}} {{required}} daily prayers, a muezzin calls the worshippers to prayer from the minaret. In many countries like Singapore where Muslims {{are not the}} majority, mosques are prohibited from loudly broadcasting the call to prayer (adhan), although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be said loudly to the surrounding community. The adhan is required before every prayer. However, nearly every mosque assigns a muezzin for each prayer to say the adhan {{as it is a}} recommended practice or sunnah of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. At mosques that do not have minarets, the adhan is called instead from inside the mosque or somewhere else on the ground. The iqama, which is similar to the adhan and said immediately before the start of prayer, is usually not said from the minaret even if a mosque has one.|$|E

25|$|This is a {{book that}} clatters around in a dark closet of irrelevancies for 450 pages before it bumps accidentally into its index and stops; {{but that is not}} a criticism, either, because its author finds it gratifying and {{refreshing}} to bang unrelated facts together as a rebuke to stuffy minds. This book infuriated me; but that is not a defect in it, because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> infuriate people like me, and the author would have been happier still if I had blown out an artery. In short, this book is flawless, because all its deficiencies are deliberate products of art. Given its assumptions, there is nothing here to criticize. The only course open to a reviewer who dislikes this book as much as I do is to question its author’s fundamental assumptions—which are big-ticket items involving the nature and relationships of language, knowledge, and science.|$|E
25|$|Dungeon Keeper was {{announced}} in August 2013, although development began the previous year. It was scheduled for a winter release, and designed for touchscreens. According to senior producer Jeff Skalski, Mythic Entertainment had to make significant changes to Dungeon Keeper for mobile platforms, although there were aspects of the original games from Bullfrog Productions they wanted to keep, such as the humour. The intention was to give players an experience of the original Dungeon Keeper. Despite this, he stated {{that they were not}} trying to recreate the original games, or the cancelled Dungeon Keeper 3, but rather a mobile game for mobile systems. The colour palette was expanded to make the creatures easier to see on mobile phones. The role of traps was increased, and gameplay was made to focus as much on offence as defence. According to Skalski, the god-view facilitated the porting to touch-screen devices. The development team took into account feedback from fans on the internet, and their goal was to make the game free so many people could play it. Skalski emphasized that the game is built for typical mobile game patterns, which meant that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be played for brief periods multiple times per day. He disagreed with assertions that it lacks the humour of the original, due to Richard Ridings (who, according to him, is a fan-favourite) providing the voice-overs like he did with the original Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Keeper 2, which included over 500 lines of dialogue.|$|E

500|$|For this game, Dante {{was made}} young, {{consumed}} by hatred and inexperienced {{resulting in a}} fighting style similar to a street brawler rather {{than that of a}} skilled swordsman. As a result of the reboot's theme being [...] "rebellion" [...] most of Dante's actions are based around it. Antoniades stated that Dante is about [...] "being cool and making you feel cool when you're playing it," [...] and, as such, they felt that his attire from previous games would be found comical. Antoniades added he felt the classic Dante was not appealing anymore and when comparing the new Dante with the title character from Bayonetta he did not see her style to be what he wanted for the reboot. Antoniades responded to criticism stating they would not change it as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> fit within the game's setting. Additionally, he stated he would have liked this Dante in response to the criticism.|$|E
