5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In {{the center of the room}} there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either in a corner of the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} Spears {{and her friends}} in a hotel room, where a tabloid {{reporter}} on television criticizes her for the sexy, revealing outfits she's often seen wearing publicly.

A strut down the lobby of the hotel and a short dance sequence follows. As they leave the hotel, they follow towards the dance club. However, before they arrive, they're caught in an alley by several paparazzi, and start to perform a dance routine {{in the middle of the}} rain. As they make their entrance, they're dripping wet, an image which makes for more sensationalist fodder for the tabloid reporter.|$|E
