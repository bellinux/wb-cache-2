Since 1999, the group concentrates on enantioselective organocatalysis as a fundamental approach complementing biocatalysis and transition metal catalysis. They have a profound interest in developing “new reactions”, designing and identifying new principles for the development of organocatalysts, expanding the scope of already developed catalysts such as proline, using organocatalysis in the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceuticals, and also investigating the mechanism by which organocatalysts activate their substrates. Furthermore, in 2005 the department has first conceptualized another approach to asymmetric catalysis, namely Asymmetric Counteranion-Directed Catalysis (ACDC).

Chapter One introduces NHCs and discusses their use as supporting ligands for early <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> and f-block complexes. Small molecule activation using organometallic complexes is examined alongside the use of electropositive metal NHC complexes in catalysis.

X-ray diffraction studies and a DFT study are used to probe the extent of covalency in the bonding of the MIV complexes. Chapter Three investigates the reactivity of the amide complexes prepared in Chapter Two. The MII complexes are shown to be initiators for the polymerisation of raclactide into biodegradable polymers. The MIII complexes are used to demonstrate additionelimination reactivity of polar substrates across the M-Ccarbene bond which allows the formation of new N-E (E = Si, Sn, P or B) bonds.

In particular, chiral alkaline earth metal phosphate complexes have unique advantages as catalysts owing to the ubiquitous availability of alkaline earth metals, strong Brønsted basicity of their counterions, mild but significant Lewis acidity of the metal and their ability to coordinate at multiple reactive sites due to large ionic radius. Chapter 1 summarizes the recent development of alkaline earth metal complexes in asymmetric catalysis. My thesis dissertation is focused on the application of chiral alkaline earth metal phosphate complexes in novel asymmetric reactions.

The industrial Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) process converts synthesis gas (syngas, a mixture of CO + H 2) into a complex mixture of hydrocarbons and oxygenates. Well-defined homogeneous catalysts for F-T may provide greater product selectivity for fuel-range liquid hydrocarbons compared to traditional heterogeneous catalysts. The first part of this work involved the preparation of late-transition metal complexes for use in syngas conversion. We investigated C–C bond forming reactions via carbene coupling using bis(carbene) platinum(II) compounds, which are models for putative metal–carbene intermediates in F-T chemistry. It was found that C–C bond formation could be induced by either (1) chemical reduction of or (2) exogenous phosphine coordination to the platinum(II) starting complexes. These two mild methods afforded different products, constitutional isomers, suggesting that at least two different mechanisms are possible for C–C bond formation from carbene intermediates.

Other than 4, which is a colourless liquid, these compounds are crystalline solids at room temperature. Their molecular structures have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction, along {{with that of the}} higher homologue of 1, tBu 2 CH 2 CH 2 tBu 2 (dtbpe, 6). The solid-state structures of the dioxide of 1, tBu 2 P(O) CH 2 P(O) tBu 2 (7), and of two phosphonium cations derived from 1, protonated [tBu 2 P(H) CH 2 PtBu 2]+ (8 +) and the chlorophosphonium ion [tBu 2 P(Cl) CH 2 PtBu 2]+ (9 +) are also described and show a distinct structural influence of the tetracoordinate P centres. The gas phase UV-photoelectron spectra of the diphosphines 1 – 6 have been measured. Their first two ionisation potentials are found to be nearly degenerate and all in the low energy range from 7. 5 to 7. 8 eV. Comparison with related mono- and bidentate phosphines demonstrates that 1 – 6 are excellent -donors towards metals, in accord with their known coordination chemistry. Molecular geometries and electronic structures of the diphosphine systems have been studied by quantum chemical calculations and are compared to experiment. Unlike standard semiempirical methods (AM 1, PM 3, MNDO) which give rather poor minimum structures and seem inadequate for such sterically crowded systems, ab initio calculations (RHF/ 6 - 31 G**) predict molecular geometries with reasonable accuracy and reflect the observed trends in experimental ionisation potentials...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the synthesis of two di-N-heterocyclic carbene ligands, and their reactivity towards nickel and palladium precursors in order to synthesise new organometallic pre-catalysts for a number of important reactions. The catalytic properties of a new rhodium C 60 compound are also investigated, with relevance to the evaluation of C 60 as a hydrogen storage medium. Chapter 1 reviews the preparation and chemistry of N-heterocyclic carbenes, emphasising their organometallic reactivity and role as ancillary ligands <b>in</b> homogeneous <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>catalysis.</b> An overview of relevant nickel and palladium catalysis is also presented, including olefin polymerisation, olefm / CO copolymerisation and Heck coupling reactions. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis and characterisation of the dicarbene ligands tBu CC meth and tBu CC eth and their reactions with various nickel precursors in attempts to prepare chelating dicarbene nickel cis -dihalide complexes. The synthesis, characterisation and chemical reactivity of the cations [Ni(tBu CC meth) 2] 2 +, [(tBu CC meth) NiCl(PMe 3) ] + and [(tBu CC eth) NiCl(PMe 3) ] + is detailed, and their X-ray structures are compared. The unsuccessful preparation of [Ni(tBu CC eth) 2] 2 + and the relative stability of the monocations with respect to dicarbene substitution is discussed and attributed to steric factors. Chapter 3 describes the synthesis, characterisation, reactivity and catalytic studies of simple nickel and palladium cis -dimethyl complexes of the chelating dicarbene ligands. Variable temperature 1 H NMR spectroscopy showed contrasting rates of thermal hydrocarbon elimination from Ni(tBu CC meth) Me 2 and Ni(tBu CC eth) Me 2, which has previously been observed for chelating bis -phosphine analogues with various P,P' linkages (CH 2) n. These observations further corroborate the analogy between dicarbene and 6 /s-phosphine ligands. It was demonstrated that the compounds Pd(tBu CC meth) Me 2 and Pd(tBu CC eth) Me 2 are effective pre-catalysts for the Heck coupling of 4 -bromoanisole and n-butyl acrylate. In addition cations of the type [(tBu CC meth/eth) PdMe(L) ] + (L = pyridine, THF) which are relevant to olefin / CO copolymerisation were prepared. The X-ray structures of M(tBu CC eth) Me 2 (M = Ni, Pd) are discussed as well as the synthesis and structural characterisation of [(|Li-tBu CC meth) {Ni(PMe 3) Me 2 } 2]. Chapter 4 presents a brief introduction to some relevant C 60 chemistry and to the concept of hydrogen storage. The synthesis and characterisation of a new rhodium Ceo compound is described. The compound catalysed the hydrogenation and hydroformylation of simple alkenes as well as the hydrogenation of C 60 to C 60 H 36. The recovery of hydrogen gas from C 60 H 36 was investigated in order to evaluate C 60 as a hydrogen storage medium. Chapter 5 outlines the experimental details for the synthesis, characterisation, reactions and catalytic studies of the new compounds described in the preceding three chapters. Chapter 6 presents the characterising data for the new compounds described in chapters 2 and 3. Appendices contain details of the crystallographic data for the eight structurally characterised compounds described in chapters 2 and 3. </p...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{selective}} artificial metalloenzymes {{by combining the}} biological concepts for selective recognition with those of transition metal catalysis has received much attention during the last decade. Targeting covalent incorporation of organometallic catalysts into proteins, we explored site-selective covalent coupling of phosphane and N–containing ligands. The successful approach for incorporation of phosphane ligands we report herein consists of site-specific covalent coupling of a maleimide functionalized hydrazide into proteins, followed by coupling of aldehyde functionalized phosphanes via a hydrazone linkage. Site selective incorporation of N–containing ligands was obtained by coupling maleimide functionalized N–ligands to proteins via Michael addition to the maleimide double bond. These two methods can be easily applied to virtually any protein displaying a single reactive cysteine and allows {{a wide range of}} possibilities in terms of cofactor design. Site-specific covalent incorporation of transition metal complexes of phosphane ligands into proteins was successfully obtained. The success of the approach is influenced by several factors like the metal precursor, the phosphane type and the protein scaffold. Metal complexes of 5 –maleimido– 1, 10 –phenanthroline modified proteins were formed in situ, via addition of a metal precursor to the phenanthroline modified proteins or by coupling preformed metal complexes to proteins via Michael addition of the thiol group from a cysteine residue to the maleimide double bond of the N-ligand. These successful coupling methods enable the use {{of a wide range of}} protein structures as templates for the preparation of artificial transition metalloenzymes, which opens the way to full exploration of the power {{of selective}} molecular recognition of proteins <b>in</b> <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>catalysis.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 10 C(sp 3) -N bond {{formation}} {{is a potential}} high value reaction <b>in</b> <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>catalysis,</b> however, {{only a handful of}} examples of this fundamental coupling reaction step have been reported. Presented in this thesis are new efforts to promote this challenging reaction. Group 9 and 10 metals bound by the pincer ligands Pybox and PCP, respectively, were initially investigated. Evidence suggests the Ir-Et complex ([(dmPybox) Ir(Et) (OAc) ][PF 6] (12)) undergoes a β-H deprotonation, similar to an E 2 type elimination in organic chemistry, rather than the desired SN 2 nucleophilic attack. Use of strong nucleophiles, i. e. sulfur nucleophiles, resulted in the ring opening of the pybox ligand. Ir-Et complexes bound by the MeBPA ligand ([(MeBPA) Ir(OOCR) Et][PF 6] (20 and 21)), however, did undergo the desired reaction to form C-N bonds upon reaction with neutral nitrogen nucleophiles. A computational investigation of the mechanism revealed that rather than the direct attack at the Ir-Et (generally observed for high valent Pd and Pt) the complex first undergoes β-hydrogen elimination to form an Ir ethylene complex. Nucleophilic attack by amine at the olefin then forms the C-N bond. In the final chapter the synthesis and characterization of new a new Rh-Me complex ((DPEphos) RhMe(I) 2 (25)), which undergoes C(sp 3) -I reductive elimination, is described. A kinetic investigation of the mechanism indicated two competing mechanisms involving SN 2 attack by iodide at both cationic and neutral Rh-Me species. The demonstration of {{bond formation}} via nucleophilic attack at the Rh-Me allowed for the room temperature functionalization of the methyl ligand with both nitrogen and sulfur nucleophiles...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explored}} {{the development of}} several methodologies for the stereoselective construction of ligand frameworks {{and some of their}} applications. The first segment concerns the application of an enantioselective lithiation at an Sp 3 _ hybridized position adjacent to nitrogen by means of the widely used and typically highly effective enantioselective lithiation with (-) -sparteine. This investigation was intended to develop a method to install chirality into a system that would be converted into a family of diaminoylidenes for use as phosphine mimics <b>in</b> <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>catalysis</b> or as nucleophilic reagents. Molecular modeling of the system revealed some key interactions between the substrate and (-) -sparteine that provided general insight into the diamine's mode of action and should lend some predictive value to its future applications. The second portion focuses on the development of methods to access 1, 2 - disubstituted aminoferrocenes, an underexplored class of metallocenes possessing planar chirality. Two routes were examined involving a diastereoselective and an enantioselective pathway, where the latter method made use of the first BF 3 -mediated lithiation-substitution to install planar chirality. Key derivatives such as 1, 2 - aminophosphines, made readily accessible by the new route, were evaluated as ligands for Pd(II), Pt(II) and Ir(I). These complexes show activity in a number of transformations with both achiral and prochiral substrates. Optimization experiments were conducted to prepare enantiomerically enriched 2 -substituted-I-aminoferrocenes by direct asymmetric lithiation of BF 3 -coordinated tertiary aminoferrocenes. A predictive computational model describing the transition state of this reaction was developed in collaboration with Professor Travis Dudding's group (Department of Chemistry, Brock University). The predicted stereochemistry of the process was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis of a 2 -phosphino-l-dimethylaminoferrocene derivative. Enantiomerically pure samples of the aminophosphine ligands derived from this new process have given promising preliminary results in the enantioselective hydrogenation of prochiral alkenes and warrant further stUdy in metal-mediated catalysis...|$|E
40|$|Whereas low-valent late <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>catalysis</b> {{has become}} {{indispensible}} for chemical synthesis, homogeneous high-valent <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>catalysis</b> is underdeveloped, mainly {{due to the}} reactivity of high-valent <b>transition</b> <b>metal</b> complexes and the challenges associated with synthesizing them. In this manuscript, we report a mild carbon-carbon bond cleavage reaction by a Au(I) complex that generates a stable Au(III) cationic complex. Complementary to the well-established soft and carbophilic Au(I) catalyst, this Au(III) complex exhibits hard, oxophilic Lewis acidity. This is exemplified by catalytic activation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes towards selective conjugate additions as well as activation of an unsaturated aldehyde-allene for a [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction. The origin of the regioselectivity and catalytic activity was elucidated by X-ray crystallographic analysis of an isolated Au(III) -activated cinnamaldehyde intermediate.
