5|$|Bush won the Iowa caucuses, and {{although}} he was heavily favored to win the New Hampshire primary, he trailed McCain by 19percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum, and according to political observers, he effectively became the <b>front</b> <b>runner</b> after the South Carolina primary—which according to The Boston Globe—made history for his campaign's negativity. The New York Times {{described it as a}} smear campaign.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011 the Smithsonian Institution {{announced}} it would be holding an exhibit dedicated {{to the art of}} video games. Several games were chosen initially and the public could vote for which games they felt deserved to be displayed via a poll on the exhibit's website. BioShock was considered a <b>front</b> <b>runner</b> to be displayed because of its status as a game that demonstrated how artistic the medium can be.|$|E
5|$|In June 1985 Goldschmidt {{announced}} his candidacy for Oregon Governor. His name familiarity {{and access to}} large donations through his business and political ties made him the Democratic <b>front</b> <b>runner.</b> He easily defeated Oregon State Senator Edward N. Fadeley in the May 1986 Democratic primary. Goldschmidt defeated Republican Secretary of State Norma Paulus in the 1986 general election 52% to 48%, succeeding two-term Republican Governor Vic Atiyeh, becoming the state's 33rd governor.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{entered his}} name on the New Hampshire primary ballot on January 5, 1972, {{effectively}} announcing his candidacy for reelection. Virtually assured the Republican nomination, the President had initially expected his Democratic opponent to be Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy (brother of the late president), but he was largely removed from contention after the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident. Instead, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie became the <b>front</b> <b>runner,</b> with South Dakota Senator George McGovern in a close second place.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{candidates}} {{competed in}} the election's first round on 21 October 2007; three entered the race as independent candidates, the other four were supported by political parties. Several political events, as well as tension between the Government and the political opposition, overshadowed the campaign. The <b>front</b> <b>runner</b> Lojze Peterle, supported by the governing conservative coalition, won the first round with far fewer votes than predicted by opinion polls. In the second round, held on 11 November 2007, Peterle faced the runner-up, the left-wing candidate Danilo Türk. Türk won the second round in a landslide, with 68.03% of the vote.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} {{election campaign}} began in late September 2007. The campaigns {{of the three}} <b>front</b> <b>runners</b> were based mostly on the personal appeal of the candidates, with few concrete statements about political issues. Zmago Jelinčič led an aggressive campaign, focusing on denouncing the three <b>front</b> <b>runners,</b> the Government, the ethnic and religious minorities, the Roman Catholic Church, and demanding an aggressive policy towards neighbouring Croatia.|$|R

5|$|After the Pacquiao fight, Cotto {{moved to}} the light middleweight division. On June 5, 2010, he fought against undefeated Israeli WBA Light Middleweight Champion Yuri Foreman at Yankee Stadium in New York City. Bob Arum had said that if Cotto were to win, he would become a <b>front</b> <b>runner</b> to defend the WBA belt against Manny Pacquiao in November. Cotto stated that he would {{consider}} {{a return to the}} welterweight division, in case of an interesting fight. Cotto ended up knocking Foreman down with a signature left hook to the body in the ninth round, after Foreman tore his knee, Cotto, claiming the WBA light middleweight title, his fourth overall in three different weight divisions.|$|E
5|$|In late 2014 {{and early}} 2015, Rivers briefly {{considered}} running {{to be the}} chair of Clark County, a new position created with the home rule charter that Rivers worked to pass. There is no official rule against serving both as the chair and a state senator, but there were concerns about Rivers' ability to balance the two offices. In December 2014, Rivers officially announced she would run for the office. On March 2, 2015, The Columbian reported Rivers would likely be withdrawing from the race later that week. That was confirmed when Rivers released a statement later that day that said Rivers {{would not be a}} candidate. Rivers cited the time commitment and desire to stay in the State Senate as reasons for her withdrawal. She was considered the <b>front</b> <b>runner</b> for the office.|$|E
5|$|Paul was {{considered}} a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the Presidency of the United States since at least January 2013. He delivered the Tea Party response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on February 13, 2013, while Marco Rubio gave the official Republican response. This prompted some pundits to call that date {{the start of the}} 2016 Republican primaries. That year, he spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington D.C., where he won the 2016 Presidential straw poll. Paul {{went on to win the}} straw poll for the next two years as well, leading to some considering Paul to be a <b>front</b> <b>runner</b> for the nomination, although CPAC attendees are typically considered younger and more libertarian-minded than average Republican voters.|$|E

5|$|Bruce's {{popularity}} as {{a speaker}} for government recruitment efforts also {{earned him the}} attention of the National Union of Victoria, an influential group of Melbourne businessmen who provided much of the financing for the federal Nationalist Party. As Sir William Irvine had recently resigned from parliament to become Chief Justice of Victoria, there was to be a by-election for his seat of Flinders in 1918, which the National Union asked Bruce to stand for. The Nationalist preselection for the seat attracted many candidates, and Sir Edward Mitchell, one of Australia's leading constitutional lawyers, was presumed to be the <b>front</b> <b>runner.</b> Mitchell proved to be a disappointing speaker, and Bruce won preselection {{with the help of the}} National Union. A deal arranged by acting Prime Minister William Watt prevented the newly formed Country Party from challenging Bruce in what was a partly rural seat, stretching from Dandenong out into the rural areas south and east of Melbourne. In the by-election of 11 May, Bruce easily defeated his Labor opponent Gordon Holmes.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher took {{an early}} pit stop on lap 34 {{and his team}} {{inspected}} his rear of his car {{as well as an}} adjustment to his front wing angle. He rejoined behind Barrichello, but ahead of Häkkinen who overtook Villeneuve on lap 35. Heidfeld pulled {{off to the side of}} the track with an engine failure on the previous lap after he made a pit stop. Alesi in the other Prost stalled at his pit stop and emerged in front of Irvine. Trulli became the first <b>front</b> <b>runner</b> to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 39. Alesi retired when his engine failed on lap 40. Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Zonta, Coulthard, Villeneuve and Fisichella made their pit stops over the next three laps. Salo pulled into retirement after his engine failed on lap 42. All of the drivers changed from dry to wet-weather tyres as rain began to fall from lap 42 onwards. Häkkinen was the final driver to pit on lap 46. Fisichella lost second position to Barrichello on the 47th lap after running wide.|$|E
5|$|Other {{candidates}} {{being considered}} for the position included National League president Ford Frick, Democratic National Committee chairman Robert E. Hannegan, former Postmaster General James Farley, US Senator John W. Bricker, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, former federal judge Fred M. Vinson, Ohio Governor Frank Lausche, and Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson. After Cincinnati Reds owner Warren Giles and Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley raised strong opposition to Frick, formerly the <b>front</b> <b>runner,</b> New York Yankees co-owner Larry MacPhail began to advocate for Chandler. When the owners met in Cleveland, Ohio on April 24, 1945 {{to vote for a}} new commissioner, Chandler's name was not on the short list; the candidates were Frick, Farley, Hannegan, Vinson, Lausche, and Patterson. None of the candidates received the required two-thirds majority, and after lobbying by MacPhail and New York Giants owner Horace Stoneham, the owners took an informal vote to see if anyone had the potential to be elected. Chandler's name appeared in the top three on each of the sixteen ballots. Encouraged, the owners then held another formal vote. After two ballots, Chandler received the necessary majority; a third vote was taken to make the choice unanimous.|$|E
50|$|The second FrontRunners {{club was}} formed early in 1980 when Malcolm Robinson, a runner and {{employee}} of New York Road Runners, organized a gay running club and modeled {{it after the}} FrontRunners. He called it FrontRrunners New York. Soon after, the Los Angeles <b>Front</b> <b>Runners</b> was formed.

5|$|At the start, several drivers {{made contact}} with one another into turn two. Sebastian Vettel {{was hit in the}} rear by Daniil Kvyat there and during turn three, the latter of which caused him to crash into the barrier and retire from the competition. Further back, Nico Hülkenberg was hit by Esteban Gutiérrez and {{collected}} Rio Haryanto, forcing both Hülkenberg and Haryanto into retirement as well. As the safety car came out to allow for the cars and debris to be cleared from the track, several cars headed to the pit lane to repair damage, among them Daniel Ricciardo, Daniil Kvyat and Sergio Pérez. The order at the restart on lap four was: Rosberg, Räikkönen, Bottas, Massa and Hamilton, who had stayed clear of the incidents to move up to fifth. On the restart, Bottas moved ahead of Räikkönen, while Hamilton made a successful move on Massa into fourth. Kvyat's early pit stop left him in 15th at that point, and he soon served a ten-second stop-and-go penalty for his contacts with Vettel, dropping him to last. Meanwhile, Hamilton overtook Räikkönen to move into third on lap seven. Felipe Nasr came into the pit lane on lap 12 to replace a slow puncture on his tyres. The order at the front remained the same until Bottas became the first <b>front</b> <b>runner</b> to pit for fresh tyres on lap 17. Hamilton followed suit one lap later, but still emerged behind Bottas, overtaking him into turn two another lap later. On lap 20, Räikkönen made a pit stop as well, coming back out behind Hamilton, but ahead of Bottas. All the while, Rosberg led comfortably ahead of Max Verstappen, who made his first stop on lap 23 and dropped back.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher lapped {{consistently}} in the 1:26 range, {{setting the}} new fastest lap {{of the race}} on lap 22, a 1:26.428, to extend his lead over Häkkinen to 5.4 seconds, who in turn was 9.9 seconds in front of Zonta. Verstappen in fourth was a further 2.9 seconds behind, but was drawing ahead of Ralf Schumacher in fifth. On lap 23, Zonta became the first <b>front</b> <b>runner</b> to make a scheduled pit stop and emerged in eleventh position. Salo continued {{to move up the}} field when he passed Wurz for sixth on lap 25. Three laps later, Zonta moved into ninth position after he overtook Mazzacane and Diniz. Salo made a pit stop for the second time on lap 29 and emerged in tenth place. Verstappen took his pit stop three laps later and came out in seventh position. Zonta made his third and final pit stop of the race on lap 36 and dropped to eighth position. Michael Schumacher took his pit stop on lap 39 and rejoined 13.6 seconds behind Häkkinen, who now led the race. Three laps later, Häkkinen made a pit stop and rejoined behind Michael Schumacher with a deficit on eleven seconds. Fisichella was the final driver to make a scheduled stop on lap 44. Fisichella's pit stop was problematic: he stalled when he encountered a problem with his clutch system and his mechanics push-started his Benetton and he rejoined in eleventh.|$|E
5|$|While the two Ferraris were delayed behind Hamilton, Alonso {{was pulling}} {{away at the}} front, setting fastest laps on laps seven and fifteen. On lap 12, Robert Kubica was {{the first man to}} pit for fuel and fresh tyres, however he {{reported}} traction control problems four laps later and lost places. Alonso had extended his lead over Hamilton to 15 seconds by the first round of pitstops. He had experienced radio problems before refuelling, but these were fixed during the stop. The Renaults were circulating in eighth and tenth by the pit stops, with Fisichella ahead of Kovalainen. Button {{was one of the few}} drivers who started on the slower harder tyre and was dropping down the field, as Takuma Sato passed the Briton. All of the front runners were on the same tyre strategy, with Räikkönen being the first <b>front</b> <b>runner</b> to pit. He found himself behind Fisichella as he exited. A short pit stop by Hamilton enabled him to come out of the pits ahead of the Renault, leaving a car between himself and Räikkönen during the pit window. Heidfeld's late stop on lap 22 helped him stay ahead of Massa. The top five positions remained unchanged, however Hamilton's different strategy enabled him to escape Räikkönen and close in on leader Alonso at a second per lap. Despite pitting on lap 20, he set the fastest lap of the race on lap 22 in 1:36.701.|$|E
