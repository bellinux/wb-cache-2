40|$|A unique {{characteristic}} of Indonesian banking {{system is the}} existence of community <b>development</b> <b>banks,</b> {{which is owned by}} local governments. This study examines the performance of this type of banks compared to private and federal government banks. The sample of this study consists of 15 community <b>development</b> <b>banks,</b> 56 private banks, and 3 federal government banks from 1995 to 2006. Using the independent t-test appropriate methodology. The financial performance of banks is measured in terms of profitability, capital structure, banks risk, efficiency, size and deposits measures. Government banks are about 11 times larger than community <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> and private banks. Subsequently, they have the greatest amount of current assets, debt, deposit, financing, and operational costs. However, in term of profits, either operational or net, their amount is not statistically different from the other two types of banks.

Despite the liberalization process of the 1980 s and 1990 s, <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> have continued to play an active role in financing development in the case of many countries. In the Turkish case, the performance of <b>development</b> <b>banking</b> in supporting <b>development</b> has varied over time. However, one feature has remained constant: development and investment credits did not contribute to the alleviation of regional imbalances even during the period of import substituting industrialization from the 1960 s to 1979. Moreover, total fixed capital investments, which are the raison d’être for <b>development</b> <b>banking</b> in Turkey, have been mainly financed by commercial banks.

40|$|The study employs annual time-series and panel {{data that}} cover 38 LDCs and the periods that fall between 1960 and 1989 {{in order to}} examine the factors that {{determine}} the depth of <b>development</b> <b>banking</b> and its size viz-a-viz the total banking system. Within the framework of regression equation model, we tested the effects of 5 factors viz: inflation rate, level of economic development, economic growth, size of the public sector, and investment requirements. Our findings suggest that both the inflation rate and economic growth generally have negative effects on each of the <b>development</b> <b>banking</b> depth and the relative size of <b>development</b> <b>banking</b> within the overall banking sector while both the level of economic development and the size of public sector generally exert positive effects on the two <b>development</b> <b>banking</b> variables. On the other hand, while investment requirement generally has a positive effect on the <b>development</b> <b>banking</b> depth, it generally has an opposite negative effect on the relative size of <b>development</b> <b>banking</b> in the total banking system...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to analyze whether <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> in Germany, Spain and Brazil have made a strategic counter during the current crisis. The <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> (necessarily consistent with public policy) are a tool that can address the countercyclical strategy that could drive growth and development in countries in crisis. As countercyclical strategy of the <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> we understand actions in two ways. At the macroeconomic level the <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> can provide resources to the economy {{in a context of}} tight credit from private financial institutions. At the microeconomic level, we analyze whether the <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> have supported specific sectors and actors palliating the disadvantage access of some economic agents and ensuring the financing of productive activities chosen by public policy because of its importance in development. ...|$|R

40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{important}} reasons why lending by regional or sub-regional <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> can and should play an important and valuable complementary role in the international development architecture. We look at the specific strengths of multilateral, regional and sub-regional <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> and drawing on the successful experience of the European Investment Bank and the Andean Development Corporation conclude that the time is now for creating new regional <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> and expanding existing ones. Creating new institutions or expanding existing ones will have very clear benefits, as for instance providing regional public goods which are currently undersupplied, such as regional infrastructure. Very large pools of savings and foreign exchange reserves originate in developing countries these days and therefore the potential for a significant expansion of regional or sub-regional <b>development</b> <b>banks,</b> with only or mainly developing country members has grown significantly. At the same time, it may be desirable to create new regional <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> where gaps exist, however too much duplication of services is not desirable. ...|$|R
40|$|Historically, <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> {{have been}} an {{important}} instrument of governments to promote economic growth by providing credit and {{a wide range of}} advisory and capacity building programs to households, small and medium enterprises, and even large private corporations, whose financial needs are not sufficiently served by private commercial banks or local capital markets. During the current financial crisis, most <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> in Latin America, followed by Asia, Africa, and Europe, have assumed a countercyclical role by scaling up their lending operations exactly when private banks experienced temporary difficulties in granting credit to the private sector. Despite the importance of <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> during crisis and non-crisis periods, little is known about them. This survey examines how <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> operate, what their policy mandates are, what financial services they offer, which type of clients they target, how they are regulated and supervised, what business models they have adopted, what governance framework they have, and what challenges they face. It also examines the countercyclical role played by <b>development</b> <b>banks</b> during the recent financial crisis.
