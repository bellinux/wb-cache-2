50|$|The acorns are {{the largest}} of any North American oak (thus the Latin species name macrocarpa—large fruit), and are an {{important}} wildlife food; American black bears sometimes tear off branches to get them. However, <b>heavy</b> <b>nut</b> crops are borne only every few years. In this evolutionary strategy, known as masting, the large seed crop every few years overwhelms the ability of seed predators to eat the acorns, thus ensuring the survival of some seeds. Other wildlife, such as deer and porcupine, eat the leaves, twigs and bark. Cattle are heavy browsers in some areas. The bur oak is the only known foodplant of Bucculatrix recognita caterpillars.|$|E
40|$|The rate {{at which}} fallen hickory nuts are removed from beneath the parent tree, and the effect on this rate of the seed {{predator}} Conotrachelus affinis, was studied in an oak-hickory forest in southeastern Michigan, USA, during {{a year in which}} few nuts were produced. The trees responded to Conotrachelus, which destroyed half the nut crop, by aborting inviable nuts during the summer. The seed dispersers, mostly gray squirrels, removed fallen nuts rapidly, showing the ability to distinguish viable nuts and remove them preferentially. The number of nuts removed in a week varies directly with the number available, and removal rate increases when many viable nuts are falling. The death of most seeds before dispersal, and the squirrels' efficiency at foraging on nuts and recovering them after burial, imply that successful hickory reproduction takes place only in years of <b>heavy</b> <b>nut</b> production. ...|$|E

60|$|Remembering his comrade's admonition, Jonathan curbed his unusual impatience {{and moved}} slowly. The wind swayed the tree-tops, and rustled the fallen leaves. Birds sang as if {{thinking}} the warm, soft weather was summer come again. Squirrels dropped <b>heavy</b> <b>nuts</b> that cracked on the limbs, or fell {{with a thud}} to the ground, and they scampered over the dry earth, scratching up the leaves as they barked and scolded.

The sound of the wind deadened their voices, and even by shouting they could not make themselves heard. Now and then, above the din of the storm, was heard the crash of some falling tree; and even as they lay, they were sometimes almost lifted from the ground by the force of the wind.|$|R

40|$|Hazel (Corylus avellana) {{has been}} a key species in European {{woodlands}} throughout the Holocene (10 KYA?present). Like many tree species, it is increasingly under threat from climate change, habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive species and emergent pathogens. As knowledge of the genetic structure of natural populations of trees is vital for managing these threats, {{as well as an}} essential basis for selection of material for replanting and restocking, we analysed levels and patterns of genetic diversity in the species at a range of spatial scales using high-resolution microsatellite markers. Our findings indicate that hazel populations exhibit high levels of genetic diversity along with low levels of population differentiation, suggesting extensive gene flow. Fine-scale genetic structuring was observed in some of the woodlands studied, probably resulting from restricted dispersal of the <b>heavy</b> <b>nuts</b> produced by the species. This, coupled with higher levels of pollen-mediated gene flow, resulted in a weak but significant pattern of isolation by distance. These results suggest that replanting following potential loss of hazel populations may not necessarily require the use of material from the same locality and mirror findings in other broadleaved tree species from the same areapublishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Heavy</b> hex <b>nuts</b> may be {{selected}} with similar hardness to the studs to avoid stripping of nut threads for pressure containing (closure bolting) and primary load bearing bolting. However, industry specification for subsea production systems, e. g. such as API Specifications 6 A, 16 A, 16 C, and 17 D, allows {{the use of}} low strength <b>heavy</b> hex <b>nuts,</b> e. g. ASTM A 194 Grade 2 HM or 7 M, to be applied together with high strength studs, e. g. ASTM A 320 Grades L 43 or L 7.

Calculations and testing of nuts have been performed and capacity formulas have been established for nut structural capacities. Guidance is given on selecting nut strength/hardness to avoid stripping of nut threads. ASTM specifications give minimum quality requirements during manufacture.

60|$|We struck into roads fringed {{with native}} houses on piles, shadowed by the {{everlasting}} cocoanut palms <b>heavy</b> with young <b>nuts.</b> The heat was heavy {{with the smell}} of vegetation, and it was not the smell of the earth after the rains.

60|$|For {{the most}} part, however, {{additions}} to the flora, and still more to the fauna, were very gradually made; {{so much so that}} most of the species now found in the group did not arrive there till {{after the end of the}} Glacial epoch, and belong essentially to the modern European assemblage of plants and animals. This was partly because the islands themselves were surrounded by pack-ice during that chilly period, which interrupted for a time the course of my experiment. It was interesting, too, after the ice cleared away, to note what kinds could manage by stray accidents to cross the ocean with a fair chance of sprouting or hatching out on the new soil, and which were totally unable by original constitution to survive the ordeal of immersion in the sea. For instance, I looked anxiously at first for the arrival of some casual acorn or some floating filbert, which might stock my islands with waving greenery of oaks and hazel bushes. But I gradually discovered, in the course of a few centuries, that these <b>heavy</b> <b>nuts</b> never floated securely so far as the outskirts of my little archipelago; and that consequently no chestnuts, apple trees, beeches, alders, larches, or pines ever came to diversify my island valleys. The seeds that did really reach us from time to time belonged rather to one or other of four special classes. Either they were very small and light, like the spores of ferns, fungi, and club-mosses; or they were winged and feathery, like dandelion and thistle-down; or they were the stones of fruits that are eaten by birds, like rose-hips and hawthorn; or they were chaffy grains, enclosed in papery scales, like grasses and sedges, of a kind well adapted to be readily borne on the surface of the water. In all these ways new plants did really get wafted by slow degrees to the islands; and if they were of kinds adapted to the climate they grew and flourished, living down the first growth of ferns and flowerless herbs in the rich valleys.|$|R
60|$|As for the <b>heavy</b> {{seeds and}} <b>nuts</b> {{which are not}} {{furnished}} with wings, the notion {{is still a very}} common one that, when the trees which bear these spring up where none of their kind were noticed before, they have come from seeds or other principles spontaneously generated there in an unusual manner, or which have lain dormant in the soil for centuries, or perhaps been called into activity by the heat of a burning. I do not believe these assertions, and I will state some of the ways in which, according to my observation, such forests are planted and raised.|$|R

5000|$|Ohio State {{students}} Ray Bourhis and Sally Huber decided Ohio State {{needed a}} mascot in 1965 and convinced the athletic council {{to study the}} matter. At the time, mascots were generally animals brought into the stadium or arena. A buck deer was contemplated but rejected as impossible. [...] Instead, the buckeye was selected, as the buckeye is the official state tree of Ohio. A simple papier-mâché nut was constructed by students, worn over the head and torso, with legs sticking out. It made its appearance at the Minnesota vs. Ohio State homecoming football game on October 30, 1965. The <b>heavy</b> papier-mâché <b>nut</b> did not last and it was soon replaced by a fiberglass shell. On November 21, 1965, The Columbus Dispatch reported that judges picked Brutus Buckeye {{to be the new}} mascot's name after a campus-wide [...] "Name the Buckeye" [...] contest. The winning name was the idea of then Ohio State student Kerry J. Reed, 21.

40|$|Palaeoecological records {{provide a}} rich source of {{information}} to explore how plant distribution ranges respond to climate changes, but their use is complicated by the fact that, especially when based on pollen data, they are often spatially too inaccurate to reliably determine past range limits. To solve this problem, we focus on hazel (Corylus avellana), a tree species with large and <b>heavy</b> fruits (<b>nuts),</b> which provide firm evidence of the local occurrence of species in the past. We combine the fossil nut records of hazel from Fennoscandia, map its maximum distribution range during the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) and compare the fossil record with the Holocene hazel range shift as simulated by the LPJ-GUESS dynamic vegetation model. The results show that the current northern range limit of hazel in central and eastern Fennoscandia is constrained by too short growing seasons and too long and cold winters and demonstrate that the species responded to the HTM warming of about 2. 5 °C (relative to the present) by shifting its range limit up to 63 – 64 °N, reached a rough equilibrium with the HTM climatic conditions and retreated from there to about 60 °N during the last 4000 years in response to the late-Holocene cooling. Thus, the projected future warming of about 2. 5 °C would reverse the long-term southward retraction of species’ northern range limit in Europe and is likely to lead to hazel being a common, regeneratively reproductive species up to 63 – 64 °N. In addition to the accuracy of the projected warming, the likelihood of this scenario will depend on inter-specific competition with other tree taxa and the potential of hazel to migrate and its population to grow in balance with the warming. In general, the range dynamics from the HTM to the present suggest a tight climatic control over hazel’s range limit in Fennoscandia...|$|R
