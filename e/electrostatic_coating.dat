5000|$|The {{most common}} way of {{applying}} the powder coating to metal objects is to spray the powder using an electrostatic gun, or corona gun.

5000|$|The {{workpiece}} travels down {{a conveyor}} belt towards a paint booth, or paint tank, where it is sprayed with, or dipped into, electrostatically charged paint particles. Integrated into a powder paint booth is a powder recovery unit, which recovers between 95% and 100% of the paint over-spray coatings. After the workpiece is coated, it continues on the conveyor belt to an oven, where the paint is cured. The benefits {{to the process of}} <b>electrostatic</b> <b>coating</b> is the ability to recover the little over-spray and having the process automated which will cut costs. The reason for the little over spray is the paint particles that do not hit the piece will turn in the air {{and go back to the}} piece. There are also some drawbacks to the process: everything in the area of the coating must be grounded to prevent static buildup and can easily arc, damaging the hanging devices and/or the locations where the hanging devices rest on the conveyor. All hangers, conveyors, etc. must be cleaned often to ensure a good ground and prevent anyone in the area from getting a severe shock. In an airborne system, any recesses on the piece that is being coated can be missed because the electrostatic paint is more attracted to corners and sharp edges; this means that another process for coating can be a better option if the piece has recesses. In the dipping process, air entrapment can occur in blind holes and deep recesses, so the positioning of the part as it enters the paint tank is critical in removing any trapped air that will restrict paint coverage.|$|E

Within the scope of a R&D project carried out by the Fraunhofer IPA, coordinated by the DFO, and supported by 20 companies, the transfer of the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>coating</b> technology into production processes has been investigated on the basis of three concrete applications.

The trials at the Fraunhofer IPA coating test line, and in a production line show that in many cases the application of traditional measures for increasing the electrical conductivity of the plastic substrates (e. g., conductive primer or liquid) is no longer necessary. By using suitable paint materials and innovative techniques, e. g. the employment of racks made of insulating material, contactless grounding by gas electrodes or the employment of repelling electrodes, insulating substrates can be coated directly by electrostatic techniques (e. g., by turbo bells).

40|$|Insecticide {{resistance}} poses {{a significant}} and increasing threat to the control of malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases. We present a novel method of insecticide application based on netting treated with an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>coating</b> that binds insecticidal particles through polarity. Electrostatic netting can hold small amounts of insecticides effectively and results in enhanced bioavailability upon contact by the insect. Six pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles mosquito strains from across Africa were exposed to similar concentrations of deltamethrin on electrostatic netting or a standard long-lasting deltamethrin-coated bednet (PermaNet 2. 0). Standard WHO exposure bioassays showed that electrostatic netting induced significantly higher mortality rates than the PermaNet, thereby effectively breaking mosquito resistance. Electrostatic netting also induced high mortality in resistant mosquito strains when a 15 -fold lower dose of deltamethrin was applied and when the exposure time was reduced to only 5 s. Because different types of particles adhere to electrostatic netting, {{it is also possible}} to apply nonpyrethroid insecticides. Three insecticide classes were effective against strains of Aedes and Culex mosquitoes, demonstrating that electrostatic netting can be used to deploy a wide range of active insecticides against all major groups of disease-transmitting mosquitoes. Promising applications include the use of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>coating</b> on walls or eave curtains and in trapping/contamination devices. We conclude that application of electrostatically adhered particles boosts the efficacy of WHO-recommended insecticides even against resistant mosquitoes.
