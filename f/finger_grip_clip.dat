60|$|Crawshay's <b>fingers</b> <b>gripped</b> {{him by the}} shoulder. His very determined-looking mouth had {{suddenly}} become a ring of steel.|$|R
40|$|The <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> and {{the palm}} grip {{are the most}} common needle holder grips for hand suturing in surgery. The major {{advantages}} of the palm grip are an increased versatility and the possibility to apply controlled force. However, there is a risk for a potential loss of precision and uncontrolled movement of the needle when disengaging the ratchet mechanism of the palmed instrument. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a new needle holder, referred to as the Frimand needle holder (FNH), and evaluate surgeons' perception of it. It was designed to overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages, hence facilitating palm and <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> suturing. Moreover, we evaluated suture precision and attitudes related to the use of the <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> and the palm grip...|$|R

60|$|The child moved {{suddenly}} towards me. Her thin, shabbily gloved <b>fingers</b> <b>gripped</b> my {{arm with}} almost painful force. Her eyes {{were full of}} passionate appeal.|$|R
50|$|The {{technical}} {{structure of}} the santur is different {{in the way the}} tuning pegs are place, the bridges and the mallets. The yangqin's tuning pins are set in parallel instead of a 90-degree angle down at the side. The mallets of the santur also differ from those of the yangqin - they are made of wood with <b>finger</b> <b>grip,</b> designed to let the players perform by gripping the two mallets between their fore and middle fingers. Both modern and earlier yangqin mallets did not include <b>finger</b> <b>grips.</b>|$|R

6000|$|There was a pause, {{intense and}} real. Birkin {{wondered}} why {{his own heart}} beat so heavily. Then Gerald's <b>fingers</b> <b>gripped</b> hard and communicative into Birkin's shoulder, as he said: ...|$|R
60|$|Snap plunged {{upon his}} face. His hands beat {{the ground like}} the {{shuffling}} wings of a wounded partridge. His <b>fingers</b> <b>gripped</b> the dust, spread convulsively, straightened, and sank limp.|$|R
60|$|Quest {{closed the}} door carefully. Craig sat {{where he had been}} ordered, his <b>fingers</b> <b>gripping</b> the arms of the chair. In his eyes shone the furtive, terrified light of the trapped criminal.|$|R
60|$|Graveling {{seemed not}} to have heard him. He looked towards them both, and his <b>fingers</b> <b>gripped</b> Aaron's {{shoulder}} so {{that the young man}} winced with pain. Then without a single word he turned towards the door.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked across}} the room and threw himself with {{emphasis}} into a Morris chair. But the other man was swiftly upon him. The talon-like <b>fingers</b> <b>gripped</b> his shoulders, jerked him to his feet, and held him there.|$|R
50|$|In Japanese swordsmanship or Kendo, {{the little}} <b>finger's</b> <b>grip</b> is the {{tightest}} on the hilt. A little finger-amputee was therefore unable to grip his sword properly, weakening him in battle and making him {{more dependent on}} the protection of his boss.|$|R
6000|$|Oakes and Mr. Snyder were {{on their}} feet. Captain Muller had not moved. He sat there, his <b>fingers</b> <b>gripping</b> the cloth. Mrs. Pickett rose {{and went to a}} closet. She {{unlocked}} the door. [...] "Kitty!" [...] she called. [...] "Kitty! Kitty!" ...|$|R
60|$|I was speechless. Lord Porthoning looked up. I {{had never}} seen a face quite like his in my life. One side of it seemed drawn with pain. He checked a sob. His <b>fingers</b> <b>gripped</b> at the air as he spoke.|$|R
60|$|As {{he became}} again {{conscious}} of lips and cheek and brave shoulders {{and of her}} wide-spread <b>fingers</b> <b>gripping</b> his upper arm, she was slowly breaking the spell of the kiss. But again and again she kissed him, hastily, savage tokens of rejoicing possession.|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's intense silence. A sudden {{light had}} burned in Mr. Fentolin's eyes. His <b>fingers</b> <b>gripped</b> {{the side of}} his chair. Yet when he spoke there were no signs of anger in his tone. It was a marvellous effort of self-control.|$|R
60|$|Wingrave's face never changed; but his <b>fingers</b> <b>gripped</b> {{the arms}} of his chair so that a signet ring he wore cut deep into his flesh. When he spoke, his tone sounded almost harsh. The girl turned away to dash the tears from her eyes.|$|R
60|$|Away like a flash {{went the}} new-found {{peace in the}} girl's face. She caught at her breath, her <b>fingers</b> <b>gripped</b> {{the table in front}} of her. Once more she was as he had known her first--pale, with great terrified eyes shining out of a haggard face.|$|R

60|$|We {{were silent}} for several minutes. Suddenly my <b>fingers</b> <b>gripped</b> Louis' arm. Had I been blind {{all this time}} that they had escaped my notice? Then I {{saw that they were}} sitting at an extra table which had been hastily arranged, and I knew that they could have only just arrived.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that numerical magnitude and specific finger movements processing interfere with each other. On the basis of these interactions, the present study investigated whether action observation was able to influence a random number generation task. This task required participants to randomly produce numbers between 1 and 10 after they observed action stimuli. Those stimuli were either closing or opening movements of fingers, hands or mouth, or a stimuli color change (a control comparison condition). The results revealed that random number production was influenced by the prior presentation of the <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> movements, whereby observing a closing <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> movement led participants to produce more small than large numbers, while observing an opening <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> movement led participants to produce more large than small numbers. For the hand movement conditions, the influence on number production was less striking while the influence of the mouth movements was restricted to the opening movement with an overproduction of large numbers after this condition. Finally, stimuli color change conditions did not influence the number production task. Taken together, these results showed that some of the characteristics of the observed finger, hand and mouth grip movements appeared to automatically prime the number generation task. The findings are discussed in terms of the functional and neural mechanisms that might explain the effect, and support the view that number semantics might be grounded on sensory-motor mechanisms...|$|R
5000|$|Ideally, {{each set}} of {{coordinates}} should be sampled simultaneously and at a fixed frequency, and include times stamps per coordinate to correct non-isochronous sampling. Additional features that can be measured by the digitizers (mostly in past models) include pen height, pen barrel rotation, and grip forces (e.g., at the 3 <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> areas).|$|R
5000|$|Other known issues {{include the}} rubber <b>finger</b> <b>grip,</b> which could come loose, {{and while it}} caused no {{functional}} issues, it was bothersome and affected the [...] "feel" [...] of the camera in the shooting mode. The grip could be replaced with simple rubber cement. (Note: the grip is missing in the photo above.) ...|$|R
60|$|In {{an instant}} I {{was on the}} alert, for {{there could be no}} wood within that buried river that had not been man brought. Almost coincidentally with my first {{apprehension}} of the noise, my hand shot out across the boat's side, and a second later I felt my <b>fingers</b> <b>gripping</b> the gunwale of another craft.|$|R
50|$|The {{inventor}} of TV tray tables is unknown. The original, popular models {{consisted of two}} pieces: a metal tray with grips mounted on its underside, {{and a set of}} tubular metal legs with rubberized tips at the bottom. The <b>grips</b> <b>clipped</b> on to the legs, which could be opened up to support the tray, or collapsed for stackable storage. The tray remained clipped to one leg support during storage.|$|R
6000|$|His whisper was hoarse with excitement. Of all {{his face}} {{there was nothing}} visible but a gleam of white eyeballs. His <b>fingers</b> <b>gripped</b> Decoud's shoulder.

But you observe there is not a gleam to show us where she is." ...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the finger}} and hand force {{developments}} {{of the students who}} have taken selective/applied Tennis and Massage courses at the University have been examined. From the students of the Department of Physical Education and Sport, 19 healthy females and 73 healthy males (age = 21. 25 ± 1. 55 years (average ± SD) who have taken selective Tennis courses; 51 healthy males (age = 22. 00 ± 1. 04 years (average ± SD) who have taken Massage courses; and as the control group, 16 healthy womenand 50 healthy males(age = 21. 72 ± 1. 47 years (average ± SD) have been participated to the study. The age, length, body weight, grip strength of both hands as well as the <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> strength of the subjects have been recorded. The course schedule has been set as once a week four hours practice for both tennis and massage. Two weeks of the education and training program that takes twelve weeks in total were assigned for theoretical classes. The remaining period of ten weeks was for practice classes and the measurements were performed before and after this ten weeks period. The hand grip strength measurement has been carried out with a Takkei branded hand dynamometer whereas for the measurement of the <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> strength, a Baseline branded pinch meter has been used. For both the pre-test and final test of the <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> and hand grip strength measurements, the paired sample t test has been used in terms of in-group comparisons, whereas for the inter-group comparisons, one-way ANOVA has been used. For the significant F values, post hoc Tukey test has been used. The right hand and the left hand grip values of both test groups as well as the values of the control group have been significantly increased between the pre-test and final test. Particularly, preferring the exercises that improve the hand and <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> strengths would enable a better racket handle grip as well as an improved shot efficiency for tennis. This would also enable masseurs/masseuses to apply an efficient massage therapy with higher pressure...|$|R
50|$|The {{general design}} of a gel pen {{is similar to that}} of a regular based pen, with a barrel {{containing}} the writing mechanism and a cap, and a reservoir filled with ink. The barrels can be created in many different sizes and designs; some have <b>finger</b> <b>grips</b> of rubber or plastic. The size of the nib or pen tip ranges from 0.18 mm to 1.5 mm.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Traditional Grip. This is a {{good example}} of the ancient style that Moeller describes. Note the angle of the snare drum, which makes the {{traditional}} grip of the left hand necessary, since matched grip would be difficult to use. Also note the positioning of the right hand, which looks like the little <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> (See Moeller's book for more information, as well as George B. Bruce).|$|R
60|$|Helen {{glanced at}} the {{diminutive}} object before she took the box. The <b>finger</b> <b>grip</b> had been fashioned out of a dollar cut clean across bearing two dates engraved upon it. The first, it flashed upon her, was the one on which she had given the worn-out man that very coin, while the other had evidently been added more recently, with less skill, by some camp artificer.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, without warning, Swenson and Miller fell, {{pierced with}} savage spears, {{and at the}} same instant sinewy <b>fingers</b> <b>gripped</b> Barbara Harding, and a {{silencing}} hand was clapped over her mouth. There had been no sound above the muffled tread of the seamen. It had all been accomplished so quickly and so easily that the girl did not comprehend what had befallen her for several minutes.|$|R
