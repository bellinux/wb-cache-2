40|$|Data on {{the length}} {{structure}} of exploited stocks {{are one of the}} easiest sources of information to obtain for data-poor fisheries, and have the potential to provide cost-effective solutions to the management of data-poor fisheries. However, incorporating the results from stock assessments into a formal harvest strategy, defined here as a harvest management system that incorporates monitoring, assessment, and decisions rules for a specific fishery, usually requires information on the total catch or catch-per-unit effort, data that are not available for many data-poor fisheries. This paper describes and tests a harvest strategy where only length composition data of the catch and knowledge of basic biological parameters are available. The harvest strategy uses a recently developed methodology for stock assessment that estimates the spawning potential ratio (SPR) for an exploited stock from the length structure of the catch (the length-based SPR model; LB-SPR), and uses an effort-based <b>harvest</b> <b>control</b> <b>rule</b> to iteratively drive fishing pressure towards a target level of SPR (40 %). A management strategy evaluation framework was used to explore the behaviour of various parameterizations of the <b>harvest</b> <b>control</b> <b>rule</b> for three species with a diverse range of life-histories and M/k ratios ranging from 0. 36 (unfished population dominated by large fish) to the Beverton-Holt invariant M/k of 1. 5 (unfished population dominated by smaller fish). For all three species the harvest strategy was able to guide the fisheries towards the target SPR, although the time taken for the SPR to stabilise at the target SPR was greatest for the species with the greatest longevity and the lowest M/k. The results of this proof-of-concept study demonstrate that the combination of the LB-SPR assessment model with an iterative, effort-based <b>harvest</b> <b>control</b> <b>rule</b> can successfully rebuild an overfished stock back to sustainable levels or fish down a stock to the target SPR without significantly overshooting the target...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Management {{strategies}} include monitoring, stock assessment, <b>harvest</b> <b>control</b> <b>rules,</b> {{reference points}} and management actions. The International Seafood Sustainability Foundation convened a workshop {{to review the}} current status of the adoption of these elements into the decision-‐making process by five the Tuna RFMOs and to make recommendations for harmonizing and facilitating the process among RFMOs. Of the five RFMOs, CCSBT has formally adopted a management strategy (management procedure) for decision-‐making. The other four RFMOs are making substantial progress to identify and test key elements of management strategies, such as reference points (limit and target) and <b>harvest</b> <b>control</b> <b>rules.</b> This work is being done primarily by the RFMO science bodies, sometimes without a formal Commission mandate. The workshop reports on key issues that should be kept in mind when developing and testing management strategies: Data and models, the treatment of FMSY as a target or a limit, testing of the strategy, and implementation. The workshop concluded that management strategies have worked quite well elsewhere in fisheries, and that there is no technical constraint to advance them in the tuna RFMOs. This could be done in many cases with relatively simple, existing tools.

40|$|Abstract OnlyThe {{depletion}} of important fish stocks and {{the degradation of}} marine ecosystems are common problems worldwide. Two approaches that {{have been widely used}} to restore depleted fish stocks are the implementation of <b>harvest</b> <b>control</b> <b>rules</b> and the establishment of marine reserve networks. <b>Harvest</b> <b>control</b> <b>rules,</b> underpinned by the monitoring and assessment of the status of target stocks, provide a scientific basis for setting catch limits. No-take marine reserves have been increasingly promoted in many countries to restore depleted fish stocks as well as to enhance the sustainability of fisheries. Extensive bodies of literature exist that examine the merits and limitations of alternative <b>harvest</b> <b>control</b> <b>rules</b> and the effectiveness of marine reserve establishment. To our knowledge, however, this study is the first to investigate the connection between the two management approaches for rebuilding depleted fish stocks and fisheries. In this paper, we construct a bioeconomic model to examine the effectiveness of a no-take reserve under different stock rebuilding harvest strategies. Our parameterized model shows that the fishery will perform better in terms of both the average biomass and net present value of the fishery when the no-take reserve is established under a fast stock rebuilding harvest strategy. Importantly, however, the relative gains from establishing a no-take reserve are greater, in terms of conservation and economic objectives, when the reserve is established in conjunction with a harvest strategy that rebuild the stock slowly...|$|E

The management procedure was developed from an accepted assessment of the CRA 4 (Wellington-Hawke's Bay) fishery, which used an integrated length-based assessment model fitted to commercial fishery catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) biomass indices, commercial length-frequency data, and tag-recapture data. The assessment model had been Bayesian, and used the joint posterior distribution of parameters to predict the effect of 384 alternative <b>harvest</b> <b>control</b> <b>rules</b> on the future size of the CRA 4 stock. The <b>harvest</b> <b>control</b> <b>rules</b> all used CPUE as their input, and generated annual changes in catch, which were then simulated by the population dynamics of the operating model.

40|$|Deepwater {{fish populations}} are often {{characterized}} by their life-history as being highly susceptible to overexploitation. Moreover, dependent fisheries often develop rapidly, so overexploitation may occur before resource dynamics are quantified sufficiently to assess safe biological limits. It is therefore crucial to employ assessment methods {{that make the}} best use of limited data and management procedures that account for large uncertainties. This review provides a critical synthesis of assessment and management approaches for deepwater fisheries. Given limitations in the data, it is clear that assessments are likely to benefit from the application of derived relationships between life-history characteristics and the sharing of this and other information across stocks. It is important that uncertainty in assessment results is represented adequately, and management methods must in turn ensure that decision mechanisms are robust to an incomplete picture of resource dynamics.

40|$|<b>Harvest</b> <b>control</b> <b>rules</b> (HCR) are sets of {{well-defined}} {{rules that}} can be used for determining annual fish catch quotas or effort. If a management policy can be expressed as a HCR, then the HCR provides means to determine the total allowable catch unambiguously. In order to improve certain aspects of the performance for these rules (higher yield, lower variability of yield, less risk of decreased population biomass), strategies of increasing complexity have been suggested for fish stocks both in Europe and in North America. But is this complexity necessarily better? Are simple strategies outdated? “Traditional” harvesting strategies (i. e. constant harvest rate, fixed quota and constant escapement strategies) are simple HCRs with only one control parameter (i. e. target harvest rate, catch and escapement, respectively). “Complex” harvest control strategies are here defined as a multi-parameter HCR. In this study, three criteria (average catch and its coefficient of variability and risk of population abundance below a minimum acceptable level) are used to judge the performance of traditional and complex HCRs, utilizing a stochastic age-structured population model that mimics the dynamics of fish populations. Even though the three HCRs performed rather similarly in the different simulations, the simplest HCR achieved the best results overall. The HCRs are further evaluated against each other, paying particular attention to the tradeoffs among the performance criteria and also relating them to bio- and socioeconomic issues.

40|$|North Sea herring {{is managed}} by the EU and Norway through a <b>harvest</b> <b>control</b> <b>rule</b> where target fishing mortalities are changed if the {{estimated}} SSB falls below a trigger biomass million tonnes). This management agreement was adopted in December 1997, amended in November 2004. The management agreement includes target fishing mortalities both adult and juvenile fish. Initial studies to test the robustness of the rule assumed stable state of productivity, with stochastic variability in recruitment. Recruitment in North Sea herring has been relatively poor for the last 4 year classes 2003, 2004 and 2005). This sustained sequence of reduced recruitment has not observed before at current levels of stock biomass. According to a recent ICES study SGRECVAP) this serial poor recruitment has been caused {{by an increase in}} the mortality larvae over the first winter, and was not due to overexploitation of the stock. Thus, the short term, the productivity of North Sea herring has changed, whilst the management agreement currently has not. As the agreement is primarily based on target fishing mortalities, changes in productivity should not undermine the management agreements ability to stock, because the trigger points are based on biomass, nevertheless the agreement longer be optimum for sustainable exploitation. 2006, the ICES advice changed to account for the changes in the productivity of North herring. Projected catches and SSBs were estimated assuming a shift in recruitment average of the last 25 years (since the stock recovered from collapse) to the average four years to reflect the more recent low levels.
