5|$|A {{variety of}} {{local governments have}} {{implemented}} tree and landscape ordinances, which will help communities by providing shade during summer. Tree protection is an ordinance that does not allow someone to prune or remove trees without a city permit. An example is the city of Glendale, California: Through the Indigenous Tree Ordinance, the city of Glendale protects the following species of trees, the California sycamore, the coast live oak, mesa oak, valley oak, scrub oak, California bay. Anyone who is planning on removing or trimming the trees has to obtain an indigenous tree permit. Within the permit they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> detailed information {{about the number of}} trees affected, trunk diameter and the health of the tree itself. They also have to submit photographs of the site, and a site plan sketch.|$|E
5|$|Approval for the mission, codenamed Operation Chariot, {{was given}} on 3 March 1942. Using a French ship would involve using the Free French forces and {{increase}} the number of people aware of the raid. Consequently, it was decided the navy would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a ship of their own. The RAF complained that the raid would draw heavily on their resources; the number of aircraft assigned by RAF Bomber Command was reduced time and time again before the day of the raid. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill further complicated matters when he ordered that bombing should only take place if targets were clearly identified.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} {{sparked a}} major public discussion on station safety and security, mainly because the station was unstaffed when the suspects mugged Ali on the platform. The only security present was CCTV cameras, and the ticket barriers were left open allowing the suspects to enter the station freely. Many high-profile politicians spoke {{on the issue of}} station safety and called on rail companies to provide security or staff the station until the last train had left the station. The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone assailed Silverlink, the train company who managed the station, for not providing all-night staffing or security. The new provider of every franchise across the rail network will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> staff at all times the station is open.|$|E
50|$|At this time, the {{commanding}} officer of the Militia decided what uniform was worn, which each man provided at his own expense. the captain of each company of foot <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> for a colour, a drum and a fife. Horse troopers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> their own mounts.|$|R
50|$|The Quota System (also {{known as}} The Quod), {{introduced}} by Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger in 1790, required each English county <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a quota of {{men for the}} Royal Navy, based on its population {{and the number of}} its seaports: London, for example, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> 5,704 quotamen while Yorkshire <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> 1,081.|$|R

25|$|While {{serving as}} Secretary of Defense, Wilson enacted {{stronger}} rules against human medical experimentation. The 1953 Wilson Memo led {{the military to}} adopt the Nuremberg Code: Patients would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> written, informed consent.|$|E
25|$|Mandates that {{employers}} provide salary and wages increases over {{a two-year period}} essentially equal to the amount paid previously for basic healthcare insurance premiums, as employers no longer <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> basic healthcare coverage.|$|E
25|$|In {{the folk}} blues the singer fills up {{occasional}} gaps with words like 'Oh, lawdy' or 'Oh, baby' and the like. This meant that in writing a melody to be sung in the blues manner one would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> gaps or waits.|$|E
5|$|The intake {{design for}} Concorde's engines was {{especially}} critical. The intakes <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> low distortion levels (to prevent engine surge) and high efficiency for all likely ambient temperatures {{to be met}} in cruise. They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> adequate subsonic performance for diversion cruise and low engine-face distortion at take-off. They also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> an alternate path for excess intake air during engine throttling or shutdowns. The variable intake features required to meet all these requirements consisted of front and rear ramps, a dump door, an auxiliary inlet and a ramp bleed to the exhaust nozzle.|$|R

25|$|Negotiations on {{this new}} {{federation}} began in September 1961; however, they indicated that Trinidad would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> 75 to 80 {{percent of the new}} Federation's revenue. Also, even though Trinidad would now represent 60 percent of the new Federation's population, the proposals under consideration would give it {{less than half of the}} seats in parliament.|$|E
25|$|In some conferences, sound {{engineers}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> microphones for a {{large number}} of people who are speaking, in the case of a panel conference or debate. In some cases, automatic mixers are used to control the levels of the microphones, and turn off the channels for microphones which are not being spoken into, to reduce unwanted background noise and reduce the likelihood of feedback.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan was}} for {{utilities}} {{to be routed}} under water, with water plants {{at each of the}} hubs pumping fresh water to the islands. Power was to be supplied by the Dubai Grid and distributed through underwater cables, however as of February 2015 no cables had been laid, so that developers currently <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> their own power from diesel generators. Waste water and refuse systems are an individual concern for each island.|$|E

25|$|Between 1947 and 1970, Canadian {{citizens}} {{could only}} apply for passports by mail to Ottawa. Requirements were simple, and applicants claiming birth in Canada did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> proof of birth. The lax security {{has led to}} numerous cases of misuse of the passport, so the Canadian Government tightened the application requirements from 1970. That year, the first three Passport Canada offices were opened in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.|$|E
25|$|Amateur radio {{operations}} occur from Diego Garcia, using the British callsign prefix VQ9. An amateur club station, VQ9X, {{was sponsored by}} the US Navy for use by operators both licensed in their home country and possessing a VQ9 callsign issued by the local British Indian Ocean Territory representative. However, the US Navy closed the station in early 2013, hence any future licensed amateurs wishing to operate from the island will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> their own antenna and radio equipment.|$|E
25|$|De facto {{relationships}} often face an onerous {{burden of}} proof before rights that are automatically granted to married couples can be accessed. This means partners may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> evidence about their living and childcare arrangements, sexual relationship, finances, ownership of property, commitment to a shared life and how they present as a couple in public. This can present difficulties when de facto relationships are legally contested by other people, usually other family members. Marriages rarely encounter such difficulties as they are generally regarded as immediate and incontrovertible.|$|E

25|$|In October 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) {{was signed}} into law in the USA. Under DSHEA, {{responsibility}} for determining the safety of the dietary supplements changed from government to the manufacturer and supplements no longer required approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before distributing product. Since that time manufacturers did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> FDA with the evidence to substantiate safety or effectiveness unless a new dietary ingredient was added. It is widely believed that the 1994 DSHEA further consolidated the position of the supplement industry and lead to additional product sales.|$|E
25|$|They {{said the}} investors' victory rate was {{misleading}} {{as a measure}} of arbitration's effectiveness since they often merely reimbursed investors for their losses, most of which then went to pay legal bills, and did not include punitive damages such as a court might award that could deter future misconduct. Nor did investors arbitrating claims have access to the full range of procedures they would in court. They could not force the brokerage to produce evidence, and they often charged that the brokerages falsified or improperly withheld documents. Arbitrators also did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a written explanation for their decisions.|$|E
25|$|Members of British aristocratic {{families}} would generally be {{possessed of a}} private income and often entered one of the military services or the church, although other professions were becoming increasingly common. As the third son of the younger son of a peer, it was always clear that Petre would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> his own income, and consequently he was apprenticed from 1864 to 1869 to Joseph Samuda of London, a shipbuilder and engineer. Here he received his training in the techniques and skills of concrete manufacturing, which he was to employ with great acclaim in his later architectural career.|$|E

25|$|According to Section 11 of State Language Law, {{organizers}} of public events <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> in Latvian information, which concerns legitimate public interest (defined in Section 2 — public safety, health care et cetera). The same affects posters, billboards and signboards, according to Section 21. Previously, {{according to the}} Law of languages as amended in 1992 (Section 5), {{organizers of}} any public event had to provide translation into Latvian in their conferences. An exemption had existed for organizations of ethnic minorities and religious organizations; 1997 Law on Meetings, Processions and Pickets has foreseen free choice of language in meetings, pickets and processions, too (Section 19).|$|E
25|$|Permits {{are issued}} with a {{validity}} period of {{between one and}} five years and allow for a stay in the border area of up to three months. Permits may only be issued to lawful residents of the border area who have been resident in the border area {{for a minimum of}} one year (or longer if specified by the bilateral agreement). Applicants for a permit have to show that they have legitimate reasons to cross frequently an external land border under the local border traffic regime. Schengen states must keep a central register of the permits issued and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> immediate access to the relevant data to other Schengen states.|$|E
25|$|Rules {{can vary}} greatly between game systems; both in {{complexity}} and era. Historical rulesets {{range from the}} ancient and medieval ships to the fleets of the Age of Sail and the modern era. Often the hobbyists <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> their own scale models of ships. The 1972 game, Don't Give Up The Ship!, called for pencil and paper, six-sided dice, rulers and protractors, and model ships, ideally of 1:1200 scale. The elaborate rules cover morale, sinking, fires, broken masts, and boarding. Dice determined wind speed and direction, and hence the ship's speed {{and the use of}} its cannon by measuring angles with the protractor.|$|E
