40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} and pesticides have on plants generally injurious effect. The {{aim of this}} bachelor thesis was monitoring and evaluating the impact of concentrations (0. 5 mg / l and 5 mg / l) <b>flurochloridone</b> and fluoranthene on plants of duckweed (Lemna minor L.). From the morphological view were observed changes of appearance and growth of plants of duckweed. It was found <b>flurochloridone</b> considerable influence on plants. From the physiological view, were observed the influence to biological membranes - measurement of malonyldialdehyde content using spectrophotometry and influence {{on the degree of}} stress in plants - abscisic acid determination by radioimmunoassay. At the 4 th day of cultivation on these xenobiotic have all experimental variants increased abscisic acid content different from controls. While malonyldialdehyd as a marker of stress caused damage to lipids varied in terms of quantity of individual variants unevenly...|$|E

The context of the peer review was that requested by the European Commission following the submission and evaluation of confirmatory data. The conclusions were reached {{on the basis of the}} evaluation of the representative uses as outdoor foliar spraying against broad-leafed and grass weeds in sunflower and potato. A concern is identified...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} called "Effect of {{fluoranthene}} and <b>flurochloridone</b> on grow, metabolism {{and production of}} pea plants (Pisum sativum L.) " it was study the relationship between this organic pollutants and development of root system, photosynthetic parameters and production ability of pea plants cultivated in Richter nutrient solution. Quantum yield of PS II, specific leaf area (SLA), content of ABA in leaves and production ability was evaluated during the long time cultivation. The most degradation of production parameters was detected in plants influenced by FLU. The same chemical caused the significant differences in anatomy and morphology of root system. Both of used chemical, FLT and FLU, influenced the experimental plants very strongly and their presence caused damage of number of physiological processes...|$|E
