40|$|Simulation-based cost-risk {{analysis}} of the <b>interest</b> <b>expenditure</b> is increasingly used for policy evaluation of public debt strategies by governments around the world. This paper is a first attempt to empirically evaluate this approach by comparing its implications for the maturity structure of public debt with those derived from the optimal taxation theory of debt management. To this end, we simulate the time path {{of the distribution of}} the <b>interest</b> <b>expenditure</b> for stylized portfolios of different maturities using simple stochastic models of the evolution of the term structure of interest rates, and examine the performance of such portfolios with standard cost-risk indicators. We find that: i) the ranking of debt portfolios by expenditure risk may depend on the length of the simulation period; to obtain the same policy conclusions as the optimal taxation theory, the time horizon must extend up to the redemption date of the longest maturity bond issued over the simulation period; ii) in sharp contrast with optimal taxation theory, a cost-risk trade off naturally emerges when a risk premium on long term bonds is considered, but this may not be sufficient to identify the optimal maturity structure. Our analysis points to the danger of assuming the cost-risk minimization of the <b>interest</b> <b>expenditure</b> as the main objective of debt management. A policy that either aims to minimize the <b>interest</b> <b>expenditure</b> over a too short horizon or does not consider that risk premiums may reflect a fair price for insurance may lead to sub-optimal debt strategies. debt management, maturity structure, interest costs, interest rate risk, optimal taxation, simulation models, term structure,...|$|E

In the economic development of a country commercial banks play an important role. The outstanding macroeconomic performance of Pakistan {{in the last five years}} portrayed Pakistan as an example of successful economy. As in Pakistan, no comprehensive study has been carried out for the measurement of commercial banks efficiency to show banking sector performance under changed scenarios, so this study is conducted to determine the efficiency of commercial banks, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used due to its ability to capture multiple outputs and no danger regarding the misspecification of the frontier. Input oriented approach of DEA under Constant Returns to Scale (CRS) and Variable Return to scale (VRS) is used for the efficiency measurement of the commercial banks. In this study, scale efficiency and Returns to Scale under which commercial banks operate id also estimated. Intermediation approach is used to define the inputs and outputs of the commercial banks. Five specifications of DEA are developed for efficiency measurement by using panel data of commercial banks for the period from 2001 to 2004. For each year, efficiency frontier is estimated under each specification to measure the relative performance of commercial banks. After the estimation of efficiency form non-parametric DEA, tobit model is used to develop the relationship between efficiency scores and factors efficiency it under each specification.

40|$|The {{deduction}} of <b>interest</b> <b>expenditure,</b> {{for the purpose}} of calculating the South African taxable income on which normal tax is levied, must satisfy the requirements of the preamble to section 11 and section 11 (a) of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962, read with section 23 (g), unless a particular section makes specific provision for its deduction. There appears to be a presumption that if <b>interest</b> <b>expenditure</b> is incurred in the production of income derived from carrying on a trade, it is deductible and we need look no further. This presumption may underlie the 2005 amendment of sub-section (2) of section 24 J, which provides that interest is deductible provided it has been incurred “in the production of income” and “for the purposes of trade” (sections 11 (a) and 23 (g)). This paper discusses the deductibility of interest and, in particular, whether there are circumstances in which interest paid on a loan used to acquire a capital asset could be of a capital nature. The provisions of the Income Tax Act and court decisions relating to the deductibility of interest, as well as opinions expressed by authoritative writers on tax, are subjected to critical analysis. The paper first distinguishes the tests for determining whether an expense has been incurred “in the production of income” and whether the expense is “of a capital nature”. Specific court decisions relating to the deductibility of interest are then analysed. The research considers section 24 J of the Act, to determine whether its provisions have settled the debate, and refers briefly to the provisions of section 11 (bB), {{in the context of the}} research question. The conclusion reached in the research is that there are occasions where the courts appear to have confused the tests for determining whether <b>interest</b> <b>expenditure</b> was incurred “in the production of income” and whether it is “of a capital nature”, in certain instances have also failed to address the question of the capital or revenue nature of the <b>interest</b> <b>expenditure</b> under scrutiny, and that the matter does not appear to be settled that interest incurred on funds used to acquire a capital asset used to produce trade income is automatically deductible. ...|$|E

We focus our analysis in a model calibrated to mimic Peruvian data to evaluate the short run dynamics and the conditions for the stability of the equilibrium. We find that the rule based on the structural balance generates a counter cyclical fiscal policy, which reduces significantly output volatility.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} conceptual interaction between section 23 M and section 31 of the Income Tax Act, 1962. Both sections limit tax deductible <b>interest</b> <b>expenditure</b> paid to non-resident related persons based on specific requirements. The dissertation establishes the ambit of each section {{by relying on}} an interpretive guide, which takes into account three aspects of interpretation. These three aspects are: the ordinary grammatical meaning of the words comprising each section; the contextual understanding of each section; {{and the purpose of}} each section. The dissertation determines that there is an overlap in the ambit of section 23 M and section 31 in respect of the taxpayer to which each section applies, interest as determined for purposes of the common law and the purpose of each section, being to prevent tax base erosion through excessive interest rate deductions. Despite the presence of an overlap, a taxpayer falling within the ambit of both sections is always limited to a deduction equal to the smaller answer yielded by section 23 M or section 31. However, in respect of the carry-forward in section 23 M(4) there is uncertainty as to the calculation of the carry-forward. The dissertation recommends an amendment to section 23 M(4) to clarify the calculation of the carry-forward amount. In the absence of a carry-forward, the dissertation determines that a possible interpretational solution may be to calculate the carry-forward with reference to actual <b>interest</b> <b>expenditure</b> and to subject any deduction in respect of an amount carried forward to section 31 in the year of assessment during which a deduction is claimed.

The main purpose is to investigate, empirically, whether the post-transition fiscal policy is consistent with the intertemporal budget constraint, used as a formal theoretical framework. To test debt stabilization, the empirical analysis is made in two steps: first, we use a Bayesian methodology to conduct inference about the cointegrating relationship between budget revenues and (inclusive of <b>interest)</b> <b>expenditures</b> and to select the cointegrating rank. Second, we apply Bayesian inference to the estimation of the cointegrating vector and of the adjustment parameters. With a single cointegrating relation, we make use of some known results concerning the posterior density of the cointegrating vector, which belongs to the poly-t densities class. In this way, we experiment the usefulness of Bayesian inference in precisely assessing the magnitude of the cointegrating vector. Moreover, we show to what extent the likelihood of the data is important in revising the available prior information, relying on numerical integration techniques...|$|R

40|$|House {{and flat}} {{prices have been}} through a {{tremendous}} bust and boom cycle in Denmark. From 1986 to 1993 real prices for houses and flats dropped by one third on average, foreclosures accounted for around 1 / 6 {{of the house and}} flat turnovers in numbers, and in reality the market for owner-occupied houses and flats was in a crisis. Initiated by a strong interest rate drop and by an expansive finance policy, the market turned. From 1993 H 1 to 2004 H 1 real house prices increased 76 % and real flat prices 128 %. Moreover, Denmark has a leading position in the international household debt race and as in many other countries the fear of the consequences of a strong interest rate increase for the housing market is widespread. Therefore, in order to examine the financial stability among owner-occupiers, a sample of approx. 40, 000 owner-occupier families with data at household level has been drawn from the tax statistics for each year from 1987 to 2003. Through the analysis it is shown that the distributions of the owner-occupiers’ capital structure, measured by the net liability/housing wealth ratios, have more or less been the same throughout the 16 years, even during the long-lasting steep house and flat price rise. Moreover, since 1994 the median value of the net liability/income ratio has increased by 71 % for all owner-occupiers and by 54 % for owner-occupiers between 30 - 39 years of age. Finally, one last, important aspect of the financial stability of owner-occupiers, namely, their capacity to service their debt has been analysed. The owner-occupiers’ net interest expenditures/ income ratios before tax have been nearly halved from 1987 to 2003. Most of the drop happened during the years of the "housing market failure". From 1994 on the ratios were more slightly reduced and were in 2003 at 8. 8 % (median value) for all owner-occupiers and 12. 2 % for owner-occupiers between 30 - 39 years of age. However, if the reductions of the tax rates for deducting <b>interest</b> <b>expenditures</b> are taken into account, the 2003 after-tax-ratios are only about 2 percentage points below the 1987 after-tax ratios. At March 2005, a new challenge facing Danish owner-occupiers is that 50 % of their mortgages carry interest adjustment.

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, large and {{persistent}} discrepancies between the annual change in public debt and the budget deficit, so-called stock-flow adjustments, were a prominent feature of debt dynamics in many economies. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the underlying determinants of such discrepancies and their relationship with fiscal transparency using data for 163 countries. Results show that such discrepancies can only be partly explained by balance sheet effects and the realization of contingent liabilities and that significant differences exist in average stock-flow adjustments across countries reflecting country-specific factors. The more fiscally transparent the country, the smaller these tend to be. The contribution of stock-flow adjustments to increases in debt is likewise smaller in countries with above average fiscal transparency. This may not be coincidental, as a lack of fiscal transparency may make it easier for governments to engage in deceptive fiscal stratagems.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence that}} public debts in the advanced economies have surged {{in recent years}} to levels not recorded since the end of World War II, surpassing the heights reached during the First World War and the Great Depression. At the same time, private debt levels, particularly those of financial institutions and households, are in uncharted territory and are (in varying degrees) a contingent liability of the public sector in many countries. Historically, high leverage episodes have been associated with slower economic growth and a higher incidence of default or, more generally, restructuring of public and private debts. A more subtle form of debt restructuring in the guise of "financial repression" (which had its heyday during the tightly regulated Bretton Woods system) also importantly facilitated sharper and more rapid debt reduction than would have otherwise been the case from the late 1940 s to the 1970 s.

At the same time, private debt levels, particularly those of financial institutions and households, are in uncharted territory and are (in varying degrees) a contingent liability of the public sector in many countries. Historically, high leverage episodes have been associated with slower economic growth and a higher incidence of default or, more generally, restructuring of public and private debts. A more subtle form of debt restructuring in the guise of “financial repression” (which had its heyday during the tightly regulated Bretton Woods system) also importantly facilitated sharper and more rapid debt reduction than would have otherwise been the case from the late 1940 s to the 1970 s.
