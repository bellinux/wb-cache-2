50|$|Similar to TOC, SEM {{particle}} analysis {{represents a}} lower cost alternative to the expensive online measurements and therefore it is commonly a method of choice in less critical applications. SEM analysis can provide particle counting for particle size down to 50 nm, which generally is in-line with the capability of online instruments. The test involves installation of the SEM capture filter cartridge on the UPW sampling port for sampling on the membrane disk with the pore size equal or smaller than the target size of the UPW particles. The filter is then transferred to the SEM microscope where its surface is scanned for detection and identification of the particles. The main disadvantage of SEM analysis is long sampling time. Depending on the pore size and the pressure in the UPW system, the sampling time can be between one week and one month. However, typical robustness and stability of the particle filtration systems allow for successful applications of the SEM method. Application of <b>Energy</b> <b>Dispersive</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>Spectroscopy</b> (SEM-EDS) provides compositional analysis of the particles, making SEM also helpful for systems with on-line particle counters.|$|E
