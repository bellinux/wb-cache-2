500|$|Peart's {{drumming}} {{skill and}} technique are well-regarded by fans, fellow musicians, and music journalists. His influences are eclectic, ranging from Pete Thomas, John Bonham, Michael Giles, Ginger Baker, Phil Collins, Steve Gadd, Stewart Copeland, Michael Shrieve and Keith Moon, to fusion and jazz drummers Billy Cobham, Buddy Rich, Bill Bruford and Gene Krupa. The Who {{was the first}} group that inspired him to write songs and play the drums. Peart is distinguished for playing [...] "butt-end out", reversing stick orientation for greater impact and increased rimshot capacity. [...] "When I was starting out", Peart said, [...] "if I broke the tips off my sticks I couldn't afford to buy new ones, so I would just turn them around and use the other end. I got used to it, and continue to use the heavy end of lighter sticks – <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> solid impact, but with less 'dead weight' to sling around." ...|$|E
500|$|When the Kilmers' {{daughter}} Rose (1912–1917) was {{stricken with}} poliomyelitis (also known as infantile paralysis) shortly after birth, {{they turned to}} their religious faith for comfort. A series of correspondence between Kilmer and Father James J. Daly led the Kilmers to convert to Roman Catholicism, and they were received in the church in 1913. In one of these letters Kilmer writes that he [...] "believed in the Catholic position, the Catholic view of ethics and aesthetics, for a long time," [...] and he [...] "wanted something not intellectual, some conviction not mental – in fact I wanted Faith." [...] Kilmer would stop [...] "every morning for months" [...] on his way [...] "to the office and prayed for faith," [...] claiming that when [...] "faith did come, it came, I think, by way of my little paralyzed daughter. Her lifeless hands led me; I think her tiny feet know beautiful paths. You understand this and <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> selfish pleasure to write it down." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} many positive reviews from fans and television critics. One-time The Simpsons writer and comedian Ricky Gervais named it his second favorite episode, and said: [...] "Mr. Burns gives [...] this terrible plaque above his desk that says, 'Don't forget: You're here forever.' It's about how sometimes things don't {{go the way}} you planned, which is pretty amazing in a cartoon. Homer then puts up all the pictures of Maggie he's ever taken to strategically cover this horrible thing so it now reads, 'Do it for her.' <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lump in the throat thinking about it." [...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said: [...] "A surprisingly traditional episode. The flashback to 1993 seems a bit odd, but this {{is a good example of}} a story that doesn't overly rely on set pieces and confounded expectations for its success." [...] In a review of the sixth season, Joshua Klein of the Chicago Tribune cited [...] "And Maggie Makes Three", [...] "Treehouse of Horror V", [...] "Homer Badman", and [...] "Lisa's Rival" [...] among his favorite episodes of the season.|$|E

500|$|Adrien Niyonshuti, {{who at the}} age of 25 {{was taking}} part in his first Olympic Games, was Rwanda's sole {{representative}} in the men's cross-country cycling event, and was notable for carrying his nation's flag at the opening and closing ceremonies. He qualified for the Games based on his performance at the 2011 African Continental Mountain Bike Championship. Niyonshuti said that he was putting his focus towards the event and wanted to impress his family, [...] "To have everyone say they are behind me makes me feel good. When people congratulate me for getting to the Olympics, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> confidence and it tells me that yeah, I did well. I just want to go there and compete and finish the race. To know that so many people are behind me makes me not want to disappoint them." [...] He took part in the 12 August race, finishing 39th out of 40 cyclists, with a time of one hour, 42 minutes and 46 seconds. Niyonshuti ranked behind Russia's Evgeniy Pechenin (one hour, 41 minutes and 40 seconds) Chan Chun Hing of Hong Kong (one hour, 41 minutes and 59 seconds) but in front of last place finisher Marios Athanasiadis from Cyprus (one hour, 43 minutes and 25 seconds). He was 13 minutes and 39 seconds behind the race winner Jaroslav Kulhavý of the Czech Republic (one hour, 29 minutes and seven seconds).|$|E
500|$|With three races {{remaining}} in the Championship and a fourteen-point advantage, Webber said he would continue his pursuit of the title; [...] "I need to keep racing hard and going for victories. Clearly, if my rivals have a rough weekend {{it makes it a}} bit harder for them and <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> bit more scope, but I'm not looking to abuse that because it can all go pear-shaped very fast." [...] Vettel said his season had been fraught with car problems but he remained positive about his chances; [...] "I think it's normal to have ups and downs – and sometimes you have more, sometimes less – but, as I said, the expectation was probably {{to be in a position}} to fight for the championship and I think we're in a very strong and very good position." [...] Alonso urged his teammate Massa to help him in his title bid and said the Korean Grand Prix could become [...] "decisive" [...] for his championship rivals. He favoured Hamilton to win the Korean Grand Prix. With Hamilton twenty-eight points behind Webber and with Button a further three points behind his teammate, McLaren's team principal Martin Whitmarsh said his drivers would keep their focus in the season's remaining three races and produce consistent performances. Karun Chandhok, who raced for Hispania in the first ten races of the season, said Red Bull were the favourites to win, and that he thought the circuit's three long straights would suit the McLaren cars.|$|E
2500|$|On July 3, 2001, McRae {{was named}} {{head coach at}} Niagara, where he {{attended}} graduate school. In comments on his reasons for accepting the job, McRae said, [...] "One, my aspirations to become a head coach, and there aren't that many Division I openings that come up each year. Also, it's near home and <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> chance to see friends and family again. And my wife is from that area as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the studio recordings, Uncle Meat featured live recordings made at the Royal Albert Hall, including a recording of Don Preston playing [...] "Louie Louie" [...] on the Albert Hall pipe organ, {{at the end of}} which Zappa announces it as having been performed by the [...] "London Philharmonic Orchestra". The doo wop-influenced [...] "Electric Aunt Jemima" [...] refers to Zappa's guitar amplifier, equating it with the advertising character Aunt Jemima. Zappa explained, [...] "I get kind of a laugh out of the fact that other people are going to try to interpret that stuff and come up with some grotesque interpretations of it. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> certain amount of satisfaction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blake’s {{internally}} braced hollow wooden surfboards {{were eventually}} superseded by laminated boards with an interior layer of balsa, then by foam-and-fiberglass designs, but {{another of his}} innovations remains a fixture of modern surf- and paddleboards, the [...] "skeg" [...] or fin. Traditional surfboards were flat-bottomed, but in 1935, Blake experimented by tearing the keel off an old speedboat and attaching it {{to the bottom of}} a surfboard. Blake later remembered, [...] "I finally put the fin on the board and went out in the surf, paddled out. In paddling out, the board had an entirely different feeling with the skeg on it, it wasn't entirely a likable feeling... But I got a pretty good wave and right away found the remarkable control you had over the board with the skeg on it. It didn't spin out, it steered easy, because the tail held steady when you put the pressure on the front. You could [...] turn it any way you wanted it. I knew right from that moment it was a success. I consider it as my good solid contribution to the sport. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lot of pleasure when I see the kids drive by in [...] their cars with a fin on their board." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 15 December 2011, it was {{announced}} the [...] "Want U Back" [...] would be released as the third single from Lloyd's debut album, Sticks and Stones. The artwork was revealed on 22 December 2011. In an interview with Metro Newss Daniella Graham, Lloyd stated that she hoped that the track would help her crack the notoriously tough American market, saying [...] "It's a bit crazy because I don’t expect anyone to know who I am because I live in the UK. I'm from The X Factor and I came fourth. It's crazy and <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lot of hope. With the USA, I'm {{not going to run}} before I can walk but you never know what's going to happen." [...] The UK single release features The X Factor US season one contestant Astro. L.A. Reid, who mentored Astro, had recently signed Lloyd to Epic Records in the US. A new version of [...] "Want U Back" [...] was released as Lloyd's debut single in the US. Lloyd was reported to have collaborated with rapper Snoop Dogg on [...] "Want U Back" [...] for her US debut. The version with Snoop Dogg was released as a bonus track to Sticks and Stones on Lloyd's online store and on the Japanese edition of the album.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1980s, Hill {{committed}} {{to one of}} her greatest ambitions: photocopying the Palace of Versailles. She cited four reasons for this venture: 1) she considered Versailles to be simultaneously [...] "self-centered" [...] and [...] "public-spirited"; 2) it shared connections between the United States and France, and she considered herself to be a citizen of both countries; 3) she wanted to [...] "do something big"; 4) she wanted to see what [...] "a modern device would make of something old." [...] Additionally, she explained, [...] "I conceived the idea of photocopying the château of Versailles because, among other reasons, it is so well known through painting and photography. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> dramatic opportunity to show the difference between those disciplines and that of copying. The great variety of subject matter would allow full range to the copier's artistic capacity within a single framework." [...] She copied a bellpull, cobblestones, and a pear tree, roots and live worms included, all of which were pulled from Versailles. Her work with Versailles further introduced her experimentation with colored toner, frottage, and photogravure. Hill intended to have several exhibitions of her Versailles work, including shows titled Weeds, Worms, Water and Popsicle Sticks, Stone and Iron, Walls and Words, and Lace and Glass. Nevertheless, Hill insisted, [...] "I am not interested in Copy Art per se but rather in what I can do with a copier." ...|$|E
