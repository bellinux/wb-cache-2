50|$|<b>Distributed</b> <b>Artificial</b> <b>Intelligence</b> (DAI) is an {{approach}} to solving complex learning, planning, and decision making problems. It is embarrassingly parallel, thus able to exploit large scale computation and spatial distribution of computing resources. These properties allow it to solve problems that require the processing of very large data sets. DAI systems consist of autonomous learning processing nodes (agents), that are distributed, often at a very large scale. DAI nodes can act independently and partial solutions are integrated by communication between nodes, often asynchronously. By virtue of their scale, DAI systems are robust and elastic, and by necessity, loosely coupled. Furthermore, DAI systems are built to be adaptive {{to changes in the}} problem definition or underlying data sets due to the scale and difficulty in redeployment.|$|E

40|$|In {{the papers}} on {{knowledge}} {{during the last}} decade, a recurrent theme is the distinction between implicit knowledge ascribed to an agent and explicit knowledge available to that agent.
