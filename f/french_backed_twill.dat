500|$|By 21 March, the French and Austrian {{outposts}} overlapped, and skirmishing intensified. [...] Charles had divided his force {{into four}} columns.

Fürstenberg's force pushed the French out of Davidsweiler, and then advanced on Ruppersweiler [...] and Einhard, 5 kilometers (3mi) to the northwest of Ostrach. Saint-Cyr {{did not have the}} manpower to defend the position, and the entire line fell back to Ostrach, with Fürstenberg's troops pressuring their withdrawal. Fürstenberg's persistent pressure on the French left flank was instrumental in the collapse of {{the northern part of the}} French line. After their success in driving the <b>French</b> <b>back</b> from Ostrach, and then from the heights of Pfullendorf, the Austrian forces continued to press the <b>French</b> <b>back</b> to Stockach, and then another five miles or so to Engen.|$|R
60|$|Gradually, {{however, the}} Dutch and the Hanoverian battalions won their way forward, {{and drove the}} <b>French</b> <b>back</b> {{to the village of}} Diepenbeck, where the latter {{successfully}} maintained themselves.

60|$|The French {{resisted}} valiantly and {{a desperate}} battle {{took place on}} the narrow ford, but the impetuosity of the English prevailed, and step by step they drove the <b>French</b> <b>back</b> {{to the other side of}} the river.

50|$|By early July, the French {{force in}} the Murg Valley had dwindled to 36,000 men.

Appreciating its defensive power, Schlieffen knew {{that he would have to}} try to force the <b>French</b> <b>back</b> from the Marne or at least secure a bridgehead over the Marne and/or Seine if he did not want the second German operation/campaign of the war to result in heavy losses. To do this, Schlieffen insisted that they cross the Seine to the west of Paris and, if they managed to cross in strength against sufficiently weak opposition, then they might even be able to force the <b>French</b> <b>back</b> from the westernmost sections of the Marne and surround Paris.|$|R
