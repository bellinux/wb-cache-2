40|$|A {{process to}} design a relay lens is presented. The process is to {{concatenate}} a collimator lens and an imaging lens. For this study the imager and collimator are required to have an external or remote stop in collimated space to prevent interference upon concatenation. The relay is created by concatenating the collimator and imager at the external or remote stop. This process allows the use of optimized <b>infinite</b> <b>conjugate</b> imagers to develop a relay lens. A collimator lens can be created by reversing the path of an imager. Magnification is achieved by scaling the focal length of the imager while keeping the focal length of the collimator constant. Computer design software is used to develop examples of relays designed using the process. A discussion of the aberration theory governing {{the integration of the}} collimator and imager to create a relay is also presented...|$|E

40|$|A binary Fresnel Zone Axilens (FZA) is {{designed}} for the <b>infinite</b> <b>conjugate</b> mode and the phase profile of a refractive axicon is combined with it to generate a composite Diffractive Optical Element (DOE). The FZA designed for two focal lengths generates a line focus along the propagation direction extending between the two focal planes. The ring pattern generated by the axicon is focused through this distance and the radius of the ring depends on the propagation distance. Hence, the radius of the focused ring pattern can be tuned, during the design process, within the two focal planes. The integration of the two functions {{was carried out by}} shifting the location of zones of FZA with respect to the phase profile of the refractive axicon resulting in a binary composite DOE. The FZAs and axicons were designed for different focal depth values and base angles respectively, in order to achieve different ring radii within the focal depth of each element. The elements were simulated using scalar diffraction formula and their focusing characteristics were analyzed. The DOEs were fabricated using electron beam direct writing and evaluated using a fiber coupled diode laser. The tunable ring patterns generated by the DOEs have prospective applications in microdrilling as well as microfabrication of circular diffractive and refractive optical elements. © (2016) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

40|$|A {{breadboard}} {{version of}} an optical beam combiner is depicted which {{make it possible to}} use the outputs of any or all of four multimode laser diodes to pump a non-planar ring oscillator (NPRO) laser. The output of each laser diode has a single-mode profile in the meridional plane containing an axis denoted the 'fast' axis and a narrower multimode profile in the orthogonal meridional plane, which contains an axis denoted the 'slow' axis and a narrower multimode profile in the orthogonal meridional plane, which contains an axis denoted the 'slow' axis. One of the purposes served by the beam-combining optics is to reduce the fast-axis numerical aperture (NA) of the laser-diode output to match the NA of the optical fiber. Along the slow axis, the unmodified laser-diode NA is already well matched to the fiber optic NA, so no further slow-axis beam shaping is needed. In this beam combiner, the laser-diode outputs are collimated by aspherical lenses, then half-wave plates and polarizing beam splitters are used to combine the four collimated beams into two beams. Spatial combination of the two beams and coupling into the optical fiber is effected by use of anamorphic prisms, mirrors, and a focusing lens. The anamorphic prisms are critical elements in the NA-matching scheme, in that they reduce the fast-axis beam width to 1 / 6 of its original values. Inasmuch as no slow-axis beam shaping is needed, the collimating and focusing lenses are matched for 1 : 1 iumaging. Because these lenses are well corrected for <b>infinite</b> <b>conjugates</b> the combiner offers diffraction-limited performance along both the fast and slow axes...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{show that}} mapping class groups of {{surfaces}} of genus {{at least two}} contain elements of infinite order that are not conjugate to their inverses, but whose powers have bounded torsion lengths. In particular every homogeneous quasi-homomorphism vanishes on such an element, showing that elements of <b>infinite</b> order not <b>conjugate</b> to their inverses cannot be separated by quasi-homomorphisms. This note was motivated {{by the work of}} Polterovich and Rudnick [12, 13], who used the geometry of the hyperbolic plane to show that on SL 2 (Z) quasi-homomorphisms exist in abundance and have interesting properties. One of their results is the following: Theorem 1 ([12]). Let g ∈ SL 2 (Z) be an element of <b>infinite</b> order not <b>conjugate</b> to its inverse. Then there exists a homogeneous quasi-homomorphism ϕ: SL 2 (Z) → R with ϕ(g) ̸ = 0. Since homogeneous quasi-homomorphisms satisfy ϕ(g − 1) = −ϕ(g) and are constant on conjugacy classes, the assumption of the theorem is clearly necessary 1. In view of Brooks’s classical constructions of quasi-homomorphisms, this result is not suprising. In fact, Polterovich and Rudnick [12] pointed out that such a result essentially holds in much greater generality, because for all non-elementary Gromov hyperbolic groups it can be deduce...|$|R

The performance of the two approaches is compared for steady multipole wave fields and the effect of the radial basis on the condition number of the resulting equations is discussed. Transient formulations based on these elements are derived and methods for solving the resulting transient equations are discussed.

30|$|Nonparametric model {{selection}} via stick-breaking construction: In {{the context}} of target recognition using HMMs, a key issue {{is to develop a}} methodology for defining an appropriate set of states to avoid over- or under-fitting. A Bayesian nonparametric infinite HMM (iHMM) which constituted by the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) has proven effective to infer the number of states in acoustic sensing scenarios [17, 18]. However, the lack of conjugacy between the two-level HDP means that a truly variational Bayesian (VB) solution is difficult for HDP-HMM, which makes computationally prohibitive in large data problems. Recent study [19] proposes another way to constitute iHMM, where each row of transition matrix and initial state probability is given with a fully <b>conjugate</b> <b>infinite</b> dimensional stick-breaking prior, which can accommodate an infinite number of states, with the statistical property that only a subset of these states will be used with substantial probabilities, referred to as the stick-breaking HMM (SB-HMM). We utilize the truncated version of such stick-breaking construction in our model to characterize the HMM states, which {{is referred to as the}} truncated stick-breaking HMM (TSB-HMM).|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of Actran started in 1998 when Jean-Pierre Coyette, now professor of the Louvain School of Engineering - Université catholique de Louvain, and Jean-Louis Migeot, now {{professor at the}} Université Libre de Bruxelles and past-president of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium - Académie royale des sciences, des lettres et des beaux-arts de Belgique, cofounded the Free Field Technologies SA software company.The original idea {{was to develop a}} finite element-based simulation tool for vibro-acoustic applications able to overcome the limitations of the then dominant Boundary Element Method. The use of finite elements enabled the simulation of complex noise sources, the combination of multiple materials in the same model and the handling of multi-million degrees-of-freedom models. The initial target application was the prediction of the acoustic transmission through complex partitions (hence the name ACTRAN: ACoustic TRANsmission). A central feature of Actran was the use of Infinite Elements (IE) as an alternative to BEM for modelling non-reflecting boundary conditions and calculating the far field. Actran uses <b>conjugated</b> <b>infinite</b> elements, an extension of the wave envelope technique.|$|R
40|$|Several {{physical}} {{problems such as}} the `twin paradox' in curved spacetimes have purely geometrical nature and may be reduced to studying properties of bundles of timelike geodesics. The paper is a general introduction to systematic investigations of the geodesic structure of physically relevant spacetimes. The investigations are focussed on the search of locally and globally maximal timelike geodesics. The method {{of dealing with the}} local problem is in a sense algorithmic and is based on the geodesic deviation equation. Yet the search for globally maximal geodesics is non-algorithmic and cannot be treated analytically by solving a differential equation. Here one must apply a mixture of methods: spacetime symmetries (we have effectively employed the spherical symmetry), the use of the comoving coordinates adapted to the given congruence of timelike geodesics and the conjugate points on these geodesics. All these methods have been effectively applied in both the local and global problems in a number of simple and important spacetimes and their outcomes have already been published in three papers. Our approach shows that even in Schwarzschild spacetime (as well as in other static spherically symetric ones) one can find a new unexpected geometrical feature: instead of one there are three different <b>infinite</b> sets of <b>conjugate</b> points on each stable circular timelike geodesic curve. Due to problems with solving differential equations we are dealing solely with radial and circular geodesics.

40|$|Achieving {{a subtle}} {{control over the}} interplay between various {{distinct}} weak interactions between molecular building blocks through a supramolecular design makes it possible the production of self-assembled nanomaterials. This is the chemists “bottom-up” approach to nanoscience and nanotechnology. Such a strategy when applied on programmed tectons provides access towards the fabrication of 1 D, 2 D and 3 D nanoarchitectures with properties at will. Although the use of weak forces to control self-assembly attracted already a great attention 1, many are the challenges which are still open in the field. In the framework of this thesis we have focused our attention to three main aspects: Control over 2 D self-assembly, especially addressed to achieving a subtle control over the positioning of functional units and their organization, either with respect the substrate, or with respect to neighboring molecules. Expanding the 2 D self-assembly to the third dimension, i. e. growing programmed architectures, layer by layer, in a rigidly restrained fashion; Reactivity on the surface, which besides the industrial appeal {{in the development of}} new more efficient catalyst, may pave the road towards the synthesis of 2 D-conjugated thus (semi) conducting polymers as synthetic graphene-like alternatives. Three complementary topics, constituting the backbone of this thesis work, have been addressed by combining different physico-chemical methods including Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), Molecular modeling relaying on instrumental and software development, respectively. Scanning tunneling Microscopy is a powerful tool to monitor nanoscale phenomena whereas through Simulations one could attain a precise understanding and define design principles. The first objective of this thesis work was to achieve a control over the forces governing the bi-dimensional self-assembly of different building blocks at surfaces and interfaces. To this end, different systems were considered, ranging from commercially available synthons, to most rare custom made building blocks. STM was employed to explore the self-assembly of the first generation of dendrimers on graphite at the solid-liquid interface 2, providing direct insight into the effect on the supramolecular interactions. Particular attention was also paid {{to the study of the}} competition between different adsorbates – an aromatic polyol and a bypiridyn-pirimidin-amine, and to the modification of packing patterns upon addition of different metal salts, in-situ, as in the case of a functionalized porphyrinic tecton. Building up on such a knowledge on 2 D self-assembly, we have extended to order at the solid-liquid interface to the third dimension. This was accomplished by designing and investigating a hetero-aromatic tetracarboxylic acid building block which was found to form a self-templated bi-layered structure 3. The unique design principle relies on the presence of four carbonyl moieties inside the conjugated core which we were found playing different roles: (i) they represent ‘‘primary’’ recognition sites on the molecular building blocks, to promote the self-assembly into 2 D porous layers, (ii) they offer a fine control of their conformational planarity, which confers the self- templating capacity, and (iii) they introduce secondary recognition sites, which mediate the interactions between the self- assembled layers. The capacity of forming 2 D supramolecular architectures is a prerequisite towards their use for exploring surface reactions, thereby forming frameworks, where the weak forces responsible for the self-assembly are substituted with covalent bonds or strong metallo-ligand links, aiming to obtain <b>infinite</b> two dimensional <b>conjugate</b> network, which will likely cover a key role in the next generation of electronic materials. [ [...] . ]L’obtention d'un contrôle précis sur l'interaction entre les distinctes interactions faibles parmi les blocs de construction moléculaires à travers un design supramoléculaire permet la production de nanomatériaux auto-assemblées. Il s'agit de l’accès des chimistes « bottom-up» en matière de nanoscience et nanotechnologie. L'expansion d'une telle stratégie à partir de tectons bien définis fournit des solutions en vue de la fabrication de nanoarchitectures 1 D, 2 D et 3 D avec des propriétés ajustables à volonté. Bien que l'utilisation des forces faibles à contrôler l'auto-assemblage aie déjà attiré une grande attention, nombreux sont les défis qui restent ouverts dans ce domaine. Entre autres, nous avons concentré notre attention dans le cadre de cette thèse sur trois aspects principaux: - Le contrôle de l'auto-assemblage 2 D, surtout orienté vers l’obtention d'un contrôle subtil du positionnement des unités fonctionnelles et de leur organisation, soit par rapport à le substrat, ou à les distances relatives et orientations des blocs de construction.  - Élargissement de l’ auto-assemblage 2 D à la troisième dimension, c'est à dire la construction d’une architecture programmée, couche par couche, d'une façon rigidement contrôlée; - Réactivité à la surface, qui, en dehors de l’attrait d’un point de vue industriel dans le développement de nouveaux catalyseur plus efficace, peut ouvrir la voie vers la synthèse de polymères conjugués 2 D.  Trois thèmes complémentaires, constituant l'épine dorsale de ce travail de thèse, ont été traités par la combinaison de différentes méthodes physico-chimiques, incluant la microscopie à effet tunnel, la modélisation moléculaire, de relayer sur le développement instrumental et le logiciel, respectivement. La microscopie à effet tunnel est un outil puissant d’observation des phénomènes nanométriques alors que par le biais de simulations il serait possible de parvenir à une compréhension précise et de définir les principes de conception. Le premier objectif de ce travail de thèse a été la réalisation d'un contrôle sur les forces qui régissent l’auto-assemblage bi-dimensionnel de différents éléments constitutifs; Différents systèmes ont donc été considérés, allant de synthons disponibles dans le commerce, à de rares blocs de construction personnalisés. La microscopie à effet tunnel a été utilisé pour explorer l'auto-assemblage de la première génération de dendrimères sur graphite à l'interface solide-liquide, offrant un aperçu direct sur l'effet sur les interactions supramoléculaires. Une attention particulière a également été accordée à l'étude de la concurrence entre les différents adsorbats - un polyol aromatique et une bipyridyn-pyrimidin-amine, et à la modification des motifs d’emballage lors de l'addition de sels de différents métaux, in situ, comme dans le cas d'un tecton porphyrinique fonctionnalisé. En s'appuyant sur une telle connaissance de l'auto-assemblage 2 D, nous avons étendu l'ordre à l'interface solide-liquide à la troisième dimension. Cela a été accompli en concevant un bloc hétéro-aromatique tétracarboxylique acide qui est capable de former une structure bi-couches autodirigée. [ [...] . ...|$|R
