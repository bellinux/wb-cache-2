30|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> is {{the process}} in which the {{reaction}} time is of only several seconds or even less. The heating rate is very high. This requires special reactor configuration in which biomass residence times are only of few seconds. Two of appropriate designs are entrained flow reactor and the fluidized-bed reactor. <b>Flash</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> of any kind of biomass requires rapid heating and therefore the particle size should be fairly small. Major problem of the present reactors for <b>flash</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> are the quality and the stability of the produced oil, strongly affected by char/ash content of bio-oil. Besides the known problems concerning solid particles in the bio-oil, char fines will catalyze repolymerization reactions inside the oil resulting in a higher viscosity. <b>Flash</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> is of following types: flash hydro-pyrolysis is <b>flash</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> done in hydrogen atmosphere, it is carried out at a pressure up to 20 Mpa; rapid thermal process is a particular heat transfer process with very short heat residence times (between 30  ms and 1.5  s). It is done at temperatures between 400 and 950 1 C; rapid de-polymerization and cracking of feed stocks takes place; rapid heating eliminates the side reactions whereby giving products with comparable viscosity to diesel oil; solar <b>flash</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> concentrated solar radiation can be used to perform flash pyrolysis; vacuum <b>flash</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> the process is done under vacuum, the vacuum facilitates the removal of the condensable products from the hot reaction zone [56 – 58].|$|E
40|$|Fatty acids {{are near}} {{ubiquitous}} organic compounds in living organisms in the Earth’s biosphere. Following {{death of an}} organism in the marine environment its fatty acids may survive descent to the sea bed {{where they can be}} juxtaposed with minerals. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the interaction of fatty acids with the common marine mineral calcite. Adsorption of tetradecanoic acid (C 14) on calcite results in a sigmoidal or “s” isotherm. <b>Flash</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> experiments were conducted on samples of fatty acid adsorbed onto calcite and were compared with similar experiments on pure fatty acid and on salts of a fatty acid. <b>Flash</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> of pure tetradecanoic acid generated unsaturated and saturated hydrocarbons and a series of unsaturated and saturated low molecular weight fatty acids. <b>Flash</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> of free tetradecanoic acid salt produced saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, an aldehyde and a homologous series of saturated and unsaturated ketones, one of which was a symmetrical mid chain ketone (14 -heptacosanone). <b>Flash</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> data from adsorbed tetradecanoic acid samples suggested that adsorption is analogous to the formation of the calcium salt of tetradecanoic acid. A key characteristic of the <b>flash</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> products of adsorbed fatty acids and fatty acid salts was the production of ketones with higher molecular weights than the starting fatty acids. Ketonisation was not observed from the <b>flash</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> of pure acid which implied the catalytic significance of the calcite mineral surface. The abundance of hydrocarbons relative to ketones in the pyrolysates negatively correlated with the proportion of fatty acids adsorbed to the surface of calcite. The ability to use <b>flash</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> to diagnose the nature of fatty acid interactions with mineral surfaces provides a valuable tool for monitoring the fate of these important lipids at the Earth’s surface as they pass into the geosphere and are subjected to diagenetic processes...|$|E

The calcined catalysts were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and temperature programmed reduction (TPR). Samples containing adsorbed oleic acid were submitted to <b>flash</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> up to 650 &# 176;C.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The PyRos {{technology}} is a new <b>flash</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> technology that is able to produce a solids-free high-quality bio-oil from wood (saw dust) and biomass residues (jatropha cake, coconut residue, sunflower residue, etc). In this patented technology the reactor and the oil vapour cleaning unit are integrated in one cyclonic reactor with a rotating particle separator. Advantages of the PyRos technology are: a compact system, solids-free oil, less contaminants in the oil, lower viscosity, and lower costs. <b>Flash</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> is a thermal conversion process to produce oil from organic feeds (e. g biomass, waste residues, etc). About 45 - 70 % of the (dry) feed can be converted into oil. The process {{takes place in a}} few seconds at about 500 °C and atmospheric pressure. The thus produced oil can be used either for power generation or it can be upgraded to a high-quality product for the chemical industry. The PyRos <b>flash</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> {{technology is}} a low-cost compact technology that can be used on both small and medium scales.
