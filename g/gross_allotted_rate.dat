40|$|The OMPS Limb sensor {{flying on}} the Suomi-NPP mission {{measures}} vertically-resolved Earth limb spectral radiance profiles to derive a high vertical resolution ozone profile using both UV and visible light dispersed by a prism and imaged onto a single CCD. The measurement challenges include a {{wide dynamic range}} in both spectral and spatial directions and demanding stray light requirements, especially for the UV wavelengths. The proposed operational change from Suomi NPP to JPSS 2 eliminates a multiple image approach and reduces stray light levels through use of different images for different wavelength channels. Through use of a stepped integration time scheme and on-board image consolidation, the spectral radiance measurements are improved and more pixels are available for downlink within the <b>allotted</b> data <b>rate.</b> We present the operational concept, results of ground testing using the Limb sensor engineering unit and estimates of expected on-orbit performance...|$|R

In {{this article}} Emanuel {{questioned}} whether a defect in our medical ethics causes {{the failure of}} the US to enact universal health care coverage. The macro level of the issue is the proportion of total <b>gross</b> national product <b>allotted</b> to health care, the micro level is which individual patient will receive specific forms of health care, e.g., [...] "whether Mrs. White should receive this available liver for transplantation." [...] In between are the basic or essential health care services that should be provided to each citizen. The end-stage renal disease program {{is an example of a}} service that increases the total cost of health care, and reduces the amount that can be spent on basic or essential health care.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – In {{this work}} we develop a fair {{resource}} allocation scheme for a multi-class time-slotted optical overlapped code-division multiple-access (OV-CDMA) network. The resource management scheme is fair {{in the sense}} that the users have their power and <b>rate</b> <b>allotted</b> according to their quality of service (QoS) requirements. In addition, no class of users can dominate over the other classes. A unified framework is proposed, which consists of finding a single control parameter based on which the optimal transmission rate and power are obtained for every class of users. Analytical results show that the maximum transmission rate for a given class of users is only achievable when the users in that class are transmitting with the highest possible laser transmission power. In addition, we have demonstrated that the optimal transmission rates can be obtained via the solution of the rate characteristic polynomial...|$|R

Analytical results show that the max-imum transmission rate for a given class of users is only achievable when the users in that class are transmitting with the highest pos-sible laser transmission power. In addition, we have demonstrated that the optimal transmission rates can be obtained via the solution of the rate characteristic polynomial. It is shown that our proposed scheme provides a substantial improvement in the system capacity while preserving the required fairness criteria.

30|$|In {{addition}} to the containment of errors detected by the CAN controller at a CAN port, the CAN router blocks messages with invalid message identifiers and messages that violate the minimum interarrival time. The experiments show the impact of timing failures on messages on the same CAN segment and messages from other CAN segments. In the same CAN segment, message timing failures with a given priority affect all messages with lower priorities (cf. Figure 7). In contrast, the effect on messages from other CAN segments is bounded by the minimum interarrival times. The worst-case delay for a given message occurs when the bus of a CAN segment is not idle {{at the time of}} the transmission request and all higher priority messages are sent according to their minimum interarrival times. The experiments show that even lower priority CAN messages can introduce additional latencies for higher-priority ones (i.e., when a high priority message is queued for sending, but a lower priority message is currently being transmitted on the non-preemptive bus). The additional delay, regardless whether caused by a lower or higher priority message, can push two messages with the same CAN ID from a sender closer together. This behavior occurs when the last CAN message was delayed and the current one is not. In case those messages come too close, a minimum interarrival time violation occurs, even though the actual message rate (assuming a sufficiently large observation time) is not violated. For example, Figure 8 a shows this behavior for messages sent by CTN 2, where violations of the minimum interarrival time occur before CTN 2 actually exceeds its <b>allotted</b> message <b>rate.</b> Consequently, the worst case delay (beside message size and CAN bus bitrate) must also be considered for the minimum interarrival time, if a maximum message rate should be guaranteed. This worst case delay can be computed using existing approaches for response time analysis in CAN [28].|$|R
40|$|A {{malicious}} insider in {{a sensor}} network may sabotage the network {{at any level}} of operation. While most prior work on network-layer security has focused on providing control plane integrity (specifically, routing correctness), we approach a complementary and equally important problem: data plane reliability. In a data plane attack, the attacker does not attack the routing control logic, but instead directly manipulates the data payloads flowing on the network to cause disruption. We reduce the general problem of data-plane manipulation attacks to two specific attacks: packet dropping and injection, and propose two complementary protocols {{to address the problem}} as a whole. We address packet dropping with a probabilistic probing protocol which can bound the end-to-end drop rate below a fixed threshold for a given path in the presence of multiple adversarial nodes and natural packet loss. We address packet injection with a rate-limiting mechanism based on per-epoch audit to detect nodes which exceed their <b>allotted</b> data origination <b>rates.</b> In both protocols, an adversary can misbehave by at most a fixed amount on expectation, before it is detected; after detection, one of the links under its control will be removed. Hence, the total amount of misbehavior (packet injection or dropping) an adversary can inflict is a constant regardless of the lifetime of the network. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the following predictions: (1) the Ss who have a high sociometric status will have more positive self-concepts than those with lower sociometric status; (2) the Ss with a high sociometric status will show kss self-concept disparities than those with lower sociometric status; and (3) the Ss with a high sociometric status will have higher self-concept stabilities than those with lower sociometric status. 218 11 th-grade pupils from four classrooms were administered a sociometric test and self-concept rating scales three times, respectively, in May, June, and September, 1967. The sociometric criterion was "best friends", and the three-limited-choice was <b>allotted.</b> The self-concept <b>rating</b> scales consisted of 16 adjective pairs with seven point scales, on which each S responded as for real-self, ideal-self, and self as perceived by friends. From the highest end and the lowest end {{of the distribution of}} the sociometric choice scores in May, 40 high-status Ss group(HG) and 40 low-status Ss group(LG) were selected, and their self-concepts were compared. Main results obtained were as follows: (a) our prediction(1) was generally confirmed beyond the. 05 level of confidence; (b) opposing to our prediction(2), {{there was no difference in}} the self-concept disparities between HG and LG, but the difference between two mean disparity scores, real-ideal and real-friends, of HG was less than that of LG; (c) no support was obtained of our prediction(3), but the self-concept stabilities in both groups were of the same degree, regardless of the test-retest intervals. These findings were explained in terms of the social reinforcement theory and the cognitive differentiation theory...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the 2001 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 26 and 27, 2001, Athens, Georgia. The Agricultural Water: Potential Use and Management Program in Georgia program (Ag. Water Pumping) began instrumenting and {{collecting}} agricultural water use data in 1999. As of October 2000, at least 407 permitted agricultural withdrawals, {{and more than}} 600 individual sites are in the monitoring program across the state of Georgia. This represents, however, just a small subset {{of the more than}} 19, 000 permitted sites in the state. In order to scale-up this subset to represent an estimate of total statewide agricultural irrigation water, the already collected data of the Ag Water Pumping project were used to estimate monthly average use amounts per crop type. Then, based on agricultural statistics data, the total amount of irrigated acreage for each crop in the state was estimated. These two sets of estimates were combined to project the total amount of agricultural irrigation water for the whole state. An initial rough estimate, based on permit numbers of agricultural irrigators who have the capacity to pump or withdraw 4. 4 1 /sec (100, 000 gallons/day) from either surface or ground water, showed that if there are 22, 000 such sites in the state then water use would be 330, 000 M gallons/year for the whole state or 1, 012, 425 Acre- ft/year. The value arrived at using the actually measured Ag Water Pumping subset and scaling up was 489, 000 M gallons/year or 1, 501, 457 Acre-ft/year. It is encouraging that this initial analysis to scale-up refined data has given a total state water use amount which is not radically different from the extremely gross estimate {{based on the number of}} permits and their <b>allotted</b> flow <b>rates.</b> Further analysis and additional data are needed to provide a legitimate estimate of agricultural water use in the state of Georgia.

30|$|Additional outcome {{measures}} {{were based on}} the results of each service member’s Physical Evaluation Board Liaison Office (PEBLO) review. The PEBLO is a group of medical personnel responsible for determining whether or not an injured service member is able to continue serving on active duty status and how much disability a service member should receive if they are determined to be unfit for duty. Each case handled by the PEBLO is unique and, while there are guidelines followed during the evaluation of injured service members, individuals with similar injuries may have different rulings on their status and disability by the PEBLO based on a multitude of factors. In addition, each service branch has their own guidelines regarding return to duty and injury compensation that are factored into PEBLO decisions. Once a service member has reached a point of maximal medical benefit following an injury as determined by their treating physician on a case by case basis, those that are deemed capable of performing military-specific duties are placed back on active duty status. The treating physician is not always clearly identified but is usually defined as the physician of the specialty responsible for the subject’s primary limitation in returning to duty. Service members that warrant further evaluation prior to returning to active duty are reviewed by the PEBLO to determine whether a disability persists that would limit active duty status. The PEBLO categorizes the service member into one of five categories: fit for duty (FIT), eligible for continuation on active duty (COAD) in a limited capacity or under a new occupational role, temporarily disabled retired list (TDRL), permanently retired (PR) or separate with severance pay (SWSP). Correlating to the civilian sector, FIT corresponds to returning to the original occupation regardless of job requirements; COAD corresponds to returning to the workforce in a limited or different capacity; TDRL corresponds to inability to return to the workforce in any capacity owing to a disability that may be permanent but has not had sufficient time to stabilize to determine ultimate disposition; PR corresponds to the inability to rejoin the work force in any capacity and 100  % disability; SWSP corresponds to the inability to rejoin the workforce in any capacity and a disability rating < 30  %. The PEBLO also assigns each service member a disability rating that reflects how much his or her persistent cumulative disability detracts from their ability to perform military tasks. The overall disability rating takes into account all of the separate persisting conditions that limit a service member’s ability to return to duty; some injured service members may have one “disabling condition,” while others may have several conditions contributing to their overall disability. The disability rating (expressed as a percentage) also determines eligibility for disability benefits after medical discharge from active duty. For reference, an isolated-below-the-knee amputation usually carries a disability rating of 40. The disability rating is used to determine the percentage of disability payments a member will be eligible for after separation from the military. As the disability rating increases, a higher percentage of the full disability payment is <b>allotted.</b> A disability <b>rating</b> above 75  % denotes full disability, making the service member eligible for the maximum allotted disability payment.|$|R
40|$|Forty-eight Gelbvieh x Angus steers (265 ¡À 40 kg) were {{utilized}} {{to determine the}} relationships among molecular breeding values (MBV), steer performance, and carcass traits. Body weight (BW), hip height (HH), hip width (HW), exit velocity (EV; rate at which steers exited the squeeze chute and traversed 1. 8 m) and body ultrasound measurements of steers were recorded at d 0, 93 and 154 of grazing mixed stockpiled endophyte-infected and -free tall fescue. Tissue samples were collected for genomic profiling (Igenity, Merial Limited, Duluth, GA). Steers were transported to the Oklahoma State U fed for 159 d, harvested and carcass parameters recorded. At d 0 and 154 of grazing, BW was correlated (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with MBV for ADG (r = 0. 31 and 0. 32 for d 0 and 154, respectively). Hip width was correlated (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with MBV for ADG (r = 0. 33 and 0. 32 for d 0 and 154, respectively) at d 0 and 154. An inverse correlation between EV and MBV for LM area on d 0 (P 3 ̆c 0. 01; r = - 0. 48) and d 154 (P 3 ̆c 0. 03; r = - 0. 03) of grazing was observed; on d 93, EV and MBV for LM area tended to be inversely correlated. Ultrasound measurements for intramuscular fat on d 0 were correlated (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with MBV for docility (r = 0. 40). Predictive potential of MBV from the stepwise procedure for steer performance and carcass composition was low (r 2 ¡Ü 0. 22). Molecular breeding values were correlated with several measurable traits that can be obtained on-farm. Incorporation of MBV may aid cattle producers in more accurate selection practices to increase profitability of beef production. Environmental and managerial conditions are known to affect subsequent performance and carcass traits of beef cattle. The objective of the second study was to document the effect of stocking rate (SR), grazing method (GM) and breed of sire on carcass traits. Steers and heifers (n = 460) grazed ¡®Maton¡¯ rye (Secale cereale L.) and ¡®TAM 90 ¡¯ annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) pastures from January to mid-May during 5 yr. Cattle were <b>allotted</b> to stocking <b>rates</b> (SR) of high (9 animals/ha), medium (6 animals/ha), or low (4 animals/ha), GM of continuous (CONT) or rotational (RT), and fed in commercial feedyards. Calves were sired by bulls from the following breeds; Angus (n = 171), Bonsmara (n = 108), Brahman (n = 109), Braunvieh (n = 31), Hereford (n = 12), and Simmental (n = 29). Body condition score (BCS); ultrasound measurements of intramuscular fat (UIMF), longissimus dorsi muscle area, and rump fat at end of grazing; ADG during grazing (119 d ¡À 25) and feedyard (125 d ¡À 28) phases; hot carcass weight (HCW); carcass ribfat (CRF); carcass LM area (CLMA); and yield grade (YG) were determined. Effects of year, gender, SR, GM, breed of sire, and interactions were determined by ANOVA. Simmental offspring had greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) amounts of UIMF than Bonsmara and Brahman (0. 11 ¡À 0. 03 and 0. 13 ¡À 0. 03, respectively). Stocking rate affected the HCW of cattle (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with high SR (314. 1 ¡À 5. 8 kg) cattle having lighter HCW than low SR (329. 0 ¡À 4. 9 kg). Stocking rates and breed of sire did affect carcass traits, and these variables can be managed to maximize carcass value...|$|R
