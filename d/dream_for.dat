5|$|In 1807 Scipione Piattoli {{returned}} to Courland. There he finally settled, abandoned the priesthood, and married {{one of the}} ladies of the court. In his final years in Courland he was involved with Courland's educational system, and hoped to pursue some scientific studies, a lifelong <b>dream</b> <b>for</b> which he never found enough time. He died of a lung infection in Altenburg on April 12, 1809. He was buried in a park in Löbichau.|$|E
5|$|In April 1940, Winston Churchill {{took control}} of the Military Co-ordination Committee, charged with {{overseeing}} all of the military services. He selected Ismay as his chief staff officer, which also gave Ismay the additional responsibility of serving on the Chiefs of Staff Committee. While serving under Churchill had been a life-long <b>dream</b> <b>for</b> Ismay, he was initially sceptical about the duties of his new position, which seemed unclear and poorly defined.|$|E

He made our nation stronger because he made it better. His dream sustains us yet.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{conceived}} as an adventure game named <b>Dream</b> <b>for</b> the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Banjo-Kazooie {{was designed to}} appeal players of all ages {{in a similar vein}} to Walt Disney Animation Studios films. The game was a critical and commercial success, selling nearly two million copies in the United States. It was praised for its detailed graphics, immersive sound, and intricate level design. In 1999, it received two awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences: Console Action Game of the Year and Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics. The game was remastered for the Xbox 360 in 2008 and included in the Rare Replay video game compilation for the Xbox One in 2015. A sequel, Banjo-Tooie, was released in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} {{relied on}} a change of locale to inspire him to write Pi and Requiem for a <b>Dream.</b> <b>For</b> The Fountain, Aronofsky {{was inspired by a}} research trip he took to Guatemala with Handel to learn about Mayan history and philosophy. The script for The Fountain was influenced by the accounts of Uruguayan journalist Eduardo Galeano, who wrote examples of myth from an indigenous perspective, particularly Galeano's Genesis trilogy. The film Once Upon a Time in America also served as an influence on the script. Aronofsky, influenced by Bernal Díaz del Castillo's The Conquest of New Spain, applied the narrative in writing the film's conquistador scenes.|$|E
5|$|Active {{military}} service was a long-held <b>dream</b> <b>for</b> Pierce, who had admired his father's and brothers' service in his youth, particularly {{his older brother}} Benjamin's, {{as well as that}} of John McNeil Jr., husband of Pierce's older half-sister Elizabeth. As a legislator, he was a passionate advocate for volunteer militias. As a militia officer himself, he had experience mustering and drilling bodies of troops. When Congress declared war against Mexico in May 1846, Pierce immediately volunteered to join, although no New England regiment yet existed. His hope to fight in the Mexican-American War was one reason he refused an offer to become Polk's Attorney General. General Zachary Taylor's advance slowed in northern Mexico, and General Winfield Scott proposed capturing the port of Vera Cruz and driving overland to Mexico City. Congress passed a bill authorizing the creation of ten regiments, and Pierce was appointed colonel and commander of the 9th Infantry Regiment in February 1847, with Truman B. Ransom as lieutenant colonel and second-in-command.|$|E

Within a year the Conjunto 9 had run into financial problems and was dissolved and in 1972 he participated in his first concert at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, sharing the bill with other Tango orchestras.|$|E

25|$|The 1970 Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) {{production}} of A Midsummer Night's Dream {{was directed by}} Peter Brook, and is often known simply as Peter Brook's Dream.

Georgia Tech then milked the clock which set up Bynum's game-winner. Georgia Tech advanced to their first ever National Championship appearance. Oklahoma State coach Eddie Sutton was denied yet another chance at an elusive national title.|$|E

Arguing that the AKP has a <b>dream</b> <b>for</b> a new Turkey, he claimed that anyone who did not see such a dream should be embarrassed. He also promised to not marginalise or polarise the electorate, and vowed to safeguard the union of the nation.

25|$|Upon {{his return}} to Paris, Copeau needed a period of rest and reflection, but certain {{pressing}} tasks demanded his time. He finished the adaptation of The Winter's Tale, {{which would be the}} first offering when the theatre reopened in January 1920, and with Jouvet he oversaw the renovations to the stage and the lighting at the Vieux-Colombier. A unit set compatible with the dimensions of the stage area and the installation of an innovative lighting system controlled from backstagebaptized jouvetswere installed. More important in the eyes of Copeau, a school of dramatic arts remained essential if he was to realize the renewal of the theatre that had been his <b>dream</b> <b>for</b> over a decade.|$|E

Hubie, Rocko, and Marina dodge the giant boulder which lethally crushes Drake in his collapsing tower. During the escape, Rocko's <b>dream</b> <b>for</b> flight comes true as he flies himself, Hubie, and Marina to safety. Rocko hands Hubie his emerald. He presents it to Marina, who loves it, but loves Hubie more. Rocko remains in Antarctica with Hubie and Marina, and sometime later, he teaches their children how to fly.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scientists}} {{argue that}} humans <b>dream</b> <b>for</b> {{the same reason}} other amniotes do. From a Darwinian perspective dreams would have to fulfill some kind of biological requirement, provide some benefit for natural selection to take place, or at least have no negative impact on fitness. In 2000 Antti Revonsuo, {{a professor at the}} University of Turku in Finland, claimed that centuries ago dreams would prepare humans for recognizing and avoiding danger by presenting a simulation of threatening events. The theory has therefore been called the threat-simulation theory. According to Tsoukalas (2012) dreaming is related to the reactive patterns elicited by encounters with predators, a fact that is still evident in the control mechanisms of REM sleep (see below).|$|E

During the winter of 2012-2013, he was persuaded by a friend to come out of retirement and join his club Formby, where Cockbain now lives, with a view to captaining the side in 2014 and, with his vast experience, hopefully take them from the First Division into the ECB Premier League for 2015, the year of the club's 150th anniversary. On the last day of the 2014 season, Formby were proclaimed champions, winning the division by twenty points and thus fulfilling the club's <b>dream</b> <b>for</b> 2015.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1820s, {{however, the}} {{economic}} climate of the country had deteriorated, and many investors were waiting to see how the new Liverpool and Manchester Railway would succeed. Moreover, not everyone shared the <b>dream.</b> <b>For</b> most people the canals were adequate for the carriage of goods, while few travelled very far. Most people lived their lives within a few miles of their birthplace. The later story of the railways was a classic one of a product generating a demand, {{rather than the other way}} around. Thus, what investment that was forthcoming was for ventures for which a need could be clearly perceived, with a reasonable expectation of a good, and rapid, return. Although the surveys were useful in the planning of later lines, the three were never built.|$|E
