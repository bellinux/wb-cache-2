5|$|In 1961, an {{overwhelming}} majority of voters in the TID and MID service areas and San Francisco approved bond issues to finance {{the construction of a new}} dam. The irrigation districts hoped to complete the dam by 1966, but concerns that the dam would further impact decreasing populations of <b>king</b> <b>salmon</b> in the Tuolumne put a temporary stop to the project. In fact, it was not until that year that the Federal Power Commission (now Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) licensed the irrigation districts to go ahead on New Don Pedro.|$|E

5|$|While most of {{the damage}} from the Gorda Basin {{earthquake}} was considered light, there were some exceptions. In Eureka, effects included broken windows and dishes, fallen chimneys, and merchandise that fell from store shelves. In Fields Landing, <b>King</b> <b>Salmon,</b> Loleta, and Big Lagoon areas, the strongest effects included surface cracks on the ground, soil liquefaction, small landslides and rockfalls, and numerous slumps along the Eel River. Similar effects occurred along the Old Coast Highway near Trinidad and Moonstone, where the roadway was reduced to one lane of travel in some areas. Several homes were knocked off their foundations and a highway overpass collapsed in Fields Landing. Seismic wave amplification, poor design, or inadequate construction style {{may have contributed to}} losses there.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} main {{species in the}} New Zealand {{aquaculture}} industry: the green-lipped mussel, the Pacific oyster and <b>king</b> <b>salmon.</b> In 2006 these three species generated $357million in sales.

25|$|Among {{the species}} of {{salmonids}} migrating routinely through the ladder at the Chittenden Locks are Chinook (<b>king)</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Coho (silver) salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Sockeye (red) salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss).|$|E
25|$|Early written {{documents}} {{record the}} local presence of migrating {{salmon in the}} Rio Guadalupe dating {{as far back as}} the 18th century. Both steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and <b>King</b> <b>salmon</b> are extant in the Guadalupe River, making San Jose the southernmost major U. S. city with known salmon spawning runs, the other cities being Anchorage, Alaska; Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon and Sacramento, California. Runs of up to 1,000 Chinook or <b>King</b> <b>Salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) swam up the Guadalupe River each fall in the 1990s, but have all but vanished in the current decade apparently blocked from access to breeding grounds by impassable culverts, weirs and wide, exposed and flat concrete paved channels installed by the Santa Clara Valley Water District. In 2011 a small number of Chinook salmon were filmed spawning under the Julian Street bridge.|$|E
50|$|The 2007-08 Victoria <b>Salmon</b> <b>Kings</b> {{season is}} the Salmon Kings' 4th {{season in the}} ECHL. The season saw the <b>Salmon</b> <b>Kings</b> {{establish}} themselves in the ECHL with a 91-point season, and winning 42 of 72 games. Before {{the start of the}} season, the <b>Salmon</b> <b>Kings</b> signed players Ash Goldie, Kevin Estrada, Gary Gladue, and goaltender Billy Thompson to complement their returning star players Wes Goldie, Milan Gajic, Kiel McLeod, and Ryan Wade. With their new additions and returning players the <b>Salmon</b> <b>Kings</b> became an elite team in the 2007-08 season, going 15-5-0-0 through their first 20 games and continued to earn wins going into the ECHL All-Star Game. At the 2008 All-Star Game festivities in Stockton, Ash Goldie showed his impressive skills during the two-day event. At the skills competition, Goldie became the first player in the ECHL to go 5 for 5 in the target shooting event. The following night at the All-Star Game, Goldie scored an All-Star record 6 points, recording 3 goals and 3 assists to earn All-Star M.V.P. honours. After the All-Star game, the <b>Salmon</b> <b>Kings</b> struggled after going through numerous injuries and call ups, but managed to narrowly win the National West division title, and took the number two seed into the Kelly Cup playoffs. In the playoffs, the <b>Salmon</b> <b>Kings</b> won their first-ever playoff round by eliminating the Bakersfield Condors in six games. Unfortunately in the second round, the <b>Salmon</b> <b>Kings</b> were eliminated from the playoffs by the Utah Grizzlies in five games. In their West Division title season, the <b>Salmon</b> <b>Kings</b> were led offensively by the Goldie brothers. Ash Goldie finished fourth in league scoring with 83 points, second in goals with 40, and first in power play goals with 20, while his brother, Wes led the league with 42 goals and 6 shorthanded goals.|$|R

25|$|The worlds' largest {{producer}} and market supplier of the Chinook salmon is New Zealand. Marketed as <b>king</b> <b>salmon,</b> in 2009, New Zealand exported 5,088 tonnes of salmon equating to {{a value of}} NZ$61 million in export earnings. For the year ended March 2011, this amount had increased to NZ$85 million., New Zealand accounts for {{about half of the}} global production of Chinook salmon, and about half of New Zealand's production is exported. Japan is New Zealand's largest export market, with stock also being supplied to other countries of the Pacific Rim, including Australia.|$|E
25|$|Farming in {{freshwater}} for <b>king</b> <b>salmon</b> uses net cages {{placed in}} rivers, using techniques {{similar to those}} used for sea-farmed salmon. Freshwater raceways are located in several Canterbury rivers such as the Clutha and Waimakariri Rivers. In the 1990s, a unique form of freshwater salmon farming was developed in hydroelectric canals in the Mackenzie Basin. Young salmon are enclosed in pens in the Ohau and Tekapo canals. The Tekapo site, fed by fast cold waters from the Southern Alps, is the highest salmon farm in the world, 677 metres above sea level.|$|E
25|$|Around 1900, {{different}} salmon {{were introduced}} as sport fish. Only the <b>king</b> <b>salmon</b> (Chinook) {{adapted to the}} environment. For decades, the development of salmon and trout aquaculture in New Zealand was opposed by recreational fishers, {{on the grounds that}} disease would spread from fish farms into recreational fisheries, and that wild fish would be poached if they could be sold. In 1973 the government compromised by making trout farms illegal, but salmon farms legal. New Zealand is probably the only country in the world where trout farming is illegal, despite commercial interest from companies already farming salmon.|$|E
2500|$|After another losing {{season in}} 2005–06, {{during which the}} team had four {{different}} coaches behind the bench, the <b>Salmon</b> <b>Kings</b> became the ECHL affiliate of the nearby Vancouver Canucks.

[...] Under head coach, Mark Morrison, the <b>Salmon</b> <b>Kings</b> would finish with a nine-game winning streak for an overall record of 36–32–1–3, good enough for seventh place in the National Conference.

25|$|Farming {{in the sea}} (mariculture) for <b>king</b> <b>salmon</b> is {{sometimes}} called sea-cage ranching. Sea-cage ranching takes place in large floating net cages, about 25 metres across and 15 metres deep, moored to the sea floor in clean, fast-flowing coastal waters. Smolt (young fish) from freshwater hatcheries are transferred to cages containing several thousand salmon, and remain there {{for the rest of}} their life. They are fed fishmeal pellets high in protein and oil. Most of this fishmeal is imported from Australia. The salmon are harvested when they are about two years old, weighing 2.5 to 4 kilograms. Sea cages are located in the Marlborough Sounds, Akaroa Harbour and Stewart Island.|$|E
500|$|When KAL007 did {{not reach}} Bethel at 50 minutes after takeoff, a {{military}} radar at <b>King</b> <b>Salmon,</b> Alaska, tracked KAL007 at [...] north of where it should have been.

At first Justice Department lawyer Jan Van Flatern stated that they were destroyed 15 days after the shootdown. Later, {{he said he had}} [...] "misspoken" [...] and changed the time of destruction to 30 hours after the event. A Pentagon spokesman concurred, saying that the tapes are re-cycled for reuse from 24–30 hours afterwards; the fate of KAL007 was known inside this timeframe.|$|E
