5|$|Approximately 100 {{species of}} mammal {{are known to}} inhabit, or to have {{recently}} inhabited, the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding waters. This includes a few species that were introduced in the 20th century; the coypu was introduced for farming in the 1990s, and the muskrat {{was introduced in the}} early 20th century into the Russian Far East and was subsequently first recorded in Korea in the Tumen River basin in 1965. The Siberian tiger and Japanese sea lion <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> been extirpated from Korea, but are still included in standard lists of Korean mammals.|$|E

5|$|In July 2017, a {{study by}} William Sellers et al., {{published}} in the journal PeerJ found that an adult Tyrannosaurus was incapable of running due to very high skeletal loads. The study used the latest computing technology to test its findings. The researchers used two different structural mechanical systems to create the computer model. The weight they settled on for their calculations was a conservative estimate of 7 tons. The model showed that speeds above 11mph (18km/h) would <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> shattered the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus. The finding may mean that running was also not possible for other giant theropod dinosaurs like Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus and Acrocanthosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Internally, {{the south}} range {{includes}} three 16th- or early-17th-century stone fireplaces that <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> been reused {{from the earlier}} house. The north room of the attic floor and principal room {{on the first floor}} include 16th- or early-17th-century timber panelling. The room over the entrance hall features late-17th-century panelling. Two period staircases feature; one from each of the 16th and 17th centuries. The windows in the entrance hall and north room of the east range include armorial stained glass windows dated 1567, 1567 and 1575. The stairwell includes windows with 17th-century German stained glass taken from the adjacent church of St Peter and other, undated stained glass.|$|E
5|$|The {{adaptability}} and opportunistic diet of the willie wagtail <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> assisted it in {{adapting to}} human habitation; it eats {{a wide variety}} of arthropods, including butterflies, moths, flies, beetles, dragonflies, bugs, spiders, centipedes, and millipedes, and has been recorded killing small lizards such as skinks and geckos in a study in Madang on Papua New Guinea's north coast. The tailbones of these lizards have been found in their faeces although it is unclear whether the whole animal was eaten or merely the tail. Either way, lizards are only a very occasional prey item forming between 1 and 3% of the total diet. Evidence from the study in Madang suggested that the willie wagtail selectively fed nestlings larger prey.|$|E

5|$|The {{evidence}} for an ancestral world of RNA cells and computer analysis of viral and host DNA sequences are giving {{a better understanding}} of the evolutionary relationships between different viruses and may help identify the ancestors of modern viruses. To date, such analyses have not proved which of these hypotheses is correct.

The motifs <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> been taken from artwork by several artists working in Australia during the 18th and early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The solar block has two storeys and a cellar, {{and would}} <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> acted as the living space for Laurence of Ludlow {{when he first}} moved into the castle. The solar room itself is on the first floor, and is reached by {{external}} steps. The wood panelling and carved wooden fireplace are of 17th-century origin, probably from around 1640. This woodwork would have originally been brightly painted, and included spy-holes so that the hall could be observed from the solar.|$|E

5|$|There is a postern gate in {{the eastern}} wall, added in the 1450s, and a further gateway in the {{north-eastern}} corner, which gave access to Castle Point and Gull Crag below. Along {{the inside of the}} curtain walls are the foundations of a yard, 200-foot by 100-foot (61 m by 30 m), and a large rectangular building, usually identified as a grange or a barn. This would <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> supported the administration of the Embleton estates, and have included the auditor's chamber and other facilities.|$|E
5|$|Whitehall's powers over Southern Rhodesia {{under the}} 1923 {{constitution}} were, on paper, considerable; the British Crown was theoretically able to cancel any passed bill within a year, or alter the constitution however it wished. These reserved powers {{were intended to}} protect the indigenous black Africans from discriminatory legislation and to safeguard British commercial interests in the colony, but as Claire Palley comments in her constitutional history of the country, {{it would have been}} extremely difficult for Whitehall to enforce such actions, and attempting to do so would <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> caused a crisis. In the event, they were never exercised. A generally co-operative relationship developed between Whitehall and the colonial government and civil service in Salisbury, and dispute was rare.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to deep fractures and grooved lanes, Enceladus has several {{other types of}} tectonic terrain. Many of these fractures are found in bands cutting across cratered terrain. These fractures probably propagate down {{only a few hundred}} meters into the crust. Many <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> been influenced during their formation by the weakened regolith produced by impact craters, often changing the strike of the propagating fracture. Another example of tectonic features on Enceladus are the linear grooves first found by Voyager 2 and seen at a much higher resolution by Cassini. These linear grooves can be seen cutting across other terrain types, like the groove and ridge belts. Like the deep rifts, they are among the youngest features on Enceladus. However, some linear grooves have been softened like the craters nearby, suggesting that they are older. Ridges have also been observed on Enceladus, though not nearly to the extent as those seen on Europa. These ridges are relatively limited in extent and are up to one kilometer tall. One-kilometer high domes have also been observed. Given the level of resurfacing found on Enceladus, it is clear that tectonic movement has been an important driver of geology for much of its history.|$|E
