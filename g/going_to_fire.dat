5|$|Braham and Walsh {{scrambled}} {{free of the}} Mosquito and {{hid behind}} a sand dune. As they did so the aircraft's fuel tanks exploded. The Fw 190 pilot flew over at 20 feet {{and for a moment}} they believed he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> upon them. To their relief he waved and flew by. They contemplated escape but instantly German soldiers were running towards them. They had crash-landed near to a radar station and the enemy soldiers were at the crash site very quickly. The Germans fired a few shots in their direction but none hit them. They were captured and searched. The Germans found a Mauser pistol which Braham had taken from a crashed German bomber. It was not well received by his captors. Braham believed they might attack him and he had thought about grabbing the gun, fighting it out with the German guards, finding a friendly Dane and making it to Sweden somehow. The tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and offered some synthetic German coffee. Soon a pair of Luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near Esjberg.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) celebrates his winning of the Vice President {{position}} on a golf outing with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Robert California (James Spader), and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). After playing, Robert tells Jim that he dislikes the business plan for the Sabre store, citing the poor quality of the products; he only approved it because Jo Bennett wanted it, but he plans to sandbag it at a high-level meeting, and Jim is stunned when Robert strongly hints he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> Dwight over it. Jim makes several attempts to stop Dwight from attending the meeting with Robert, but Dwight is heedless and continually insults Jim, who finally decides to leave Dwight to his fate. However, a guilt-inducing phone call to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) makes Jim decide he has to keep parsing Dwight's insults until he directly tells him {{that he is going}} to lose his job. Dwight ignores the news, thinking Jim is jealous of him, so Jim resorts to wrestling with Dwight outside the conference room. In the meantime, Nellie has Todd Packer (David Koechner) stand in as VP in Dwight's absence. When Dwight makes it into the conference room, he hears Robert planning to fire the VP, so he sneaks out of the conference room and lets Packer take the fall in front of those present. Dwight then silently extends a hand to Jim, and they head back to Scranton with Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), who has reverted to his old grumpy self over the thought of leaving Florida.|$|E
500|$|Dilfer was the {{starting}} quarterback to begin the 2005 season. The team started 2–2, but had two three-game losing streaks {{later in the season}} and finished with a 6–10 record. In the team's final five games, rookie Charlie Frye took over as {{the starting}} quarterback, winning two of those contests. Before the Browns' final regular-season game, the front office was embroiled in a controversy that threatened to send the team into rebuilding mode. Citing sources, ESPN reported that president John Collins was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> general manager Phil Savage over [...] "philosophical differences" [...] in managing the salary cap. The resulting uproar from fans and local media was so strong that it was Collins who resigned on January 3, 2006. A replacement for Collins was not immediately named, and Randy Lerner assumed his responsibilities.|$|E

5000|$|Later in life, Dunn became {{mayor of}} Fresno, California (1949-57) and {{qualified}} for the nickname [...] "No-Fun Dunn" [...] because of his zest in leading raids on bordellos and gambling dens.

500|$|The {{cast and}} crew of TGS with Tracy Jordan gather to watch the season finale of Jack's summer reality show hit MILF Island, a series the plot of which is {{described}} as [...] "25 Super-Hot Moms, 50 eighth grade boys, no rules." [...] The staff soon discover {{that one of them}} told a reporter for The New York Post that Jack was a [...] "Class A Moron" [...] and that [...] "He can eat my poo." [...] They then spiral into an argument as they try to find out who made the statement. Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) later recalls that he heard Liz, in an elevator, making the statement to the journalist. Liz makes a false promise that she will tell Jack that it was her to avoid him hearing the truth from Kenneth. Liz finally reveals the truth to Jack only to find out that he already knew it was she who said it, and he's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> her—instead, she has to put together a new TV series for MILF Islands manipulative competitor Deborah.|$|E
500|$|Champion {{held out}} for several hours, {{wounding}} three of the vigilantes, and {{was said to have}} killed four others. Another settler by the name of Jack Flagg passed by Champion's ranch on his wagon together with his stepson and witnessed the siege. The Invaders recognized Jack Flagg as one of the men on the list and they started shooting at him. Flagg then rode away and as the Invaders gave chase, he grabbed his rifle and beat them back. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. [...] "Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. I wish there was someone here with me so we could watch all sides at once," [...] he wrote. The last journal entry read: [...] "Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail. I heard them splitting wood. I guess they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> the house tonight. I think I will make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It's not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, if I never see you again." ...|$|E
500|$|Much nearer was , {{which had}} warned Titanic of ice {{a few hours}} earlier. Apprehensive at his ship being caught in a large field of drift ice, [...] Californians captain, Stanley Lord, had decided at about 22:00 to halt for the night and wait for {{daylight}} {{to find a way}} through the ice field. At 23:30, 10minutes before Titanic hit the iceberg, Californians sole radio operator, Cyril Evans, shut his set down for the night and went to bed. On the bridge her Third Officer, Charles Groves, saw a large vessel to starboard around [...] away. It made a sudden turn to port and stopped. If the radio operator of Californian had stayed at his post fifteen minutes longer, hundreds of lives might have been saved. A little over an hour later, Second Officer Herbert Stone saw five white rockets exploding above the stopped ship. Unsure what the rockets meant, he called Captain Lord, who was resting in the chartroom, and reported the sighting. Lord did not act on the report, but Stone was perturbed: [...] "A ship is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> rockets at sea for nothing," [...] he told a colleague.|$|E

2500|$|Before the 2005 season began, Romeo Crennel, a {{one-time}} Browns assistant coach under Chris Palmer and, at the time, defensive {{coordinator for the}} New England Patriots, was named the Browns head coach. The team also hired Phil Savage – who had been Ravens VP/GM Ozzie Newsome's top aide – as a new general manager. But despite the changes, the Browns losing trend continued for 2005 and 2006, with records of 6–10 and 4–12, respectively. Prior to the Browns' {{final game of the}} 2005 season, ESPN reported that team president John Collins was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> Savage. However, the resulting uproar from fans and local media was strong, and on January 3, 2006, Collins resigned instead. The role of team [...] "President and CEO" [...] was vacated until 2008, with owner Randy Lerner filling in as de facto CEO until Michael Keenan was hired.|$|E

50|$|At Jack's funeral, Mike {{delivers}} {{an emotional}} eulogy {{in celebration of}} Jack's life, which inspires a standing ovation {{from friends and family}} in attendance. Jack's body is then carried to his resting place, with full honors, on the back of Engine 33 in a typical fireman's funeral procession. The film ends Mike and the guys en route to a call while the former flashes back to Jack and his fellow firefighters <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fires</b> and a final shot of Mike and Jack coming out of Jack's first ever burning building in triumph.|$|R
50|$|In {{some special}} circumstances, {{such as when}} only one round or salvo was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>fired</b> (e.g. by nuclear {{artillery}} or a multiple rocket launcher), a director or aiming circle about 100 meters away {{could be used as}} an aiming point.|$|R

500|$|The {{costs of}} filming Titanic {{eventually}} began to mount and finally reached $200million. Fox executives panicked and suggested {{an hour of}} specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics {{are more likely to}} help directors win Oscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, [...] "You want to cut my movie? You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> me! You want <b>to</b> <b>fire</b> me? You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have to kill me!" [...] The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.|$|R

Liz later notifies Jenna {{that no one is}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>fired,</b> and that the executive is actually an extra on the show. Jenna aims to get back at the pair, and although Toofer admits that he was too smart for Jenna's tactics, Frank is seen running around naked outside Jack's balcony. Jenna finally gets her chance to perform [...] "Muffin Top", unaware that the show has already ended and the number was scratched at the last moment, thanks to Liz.|$|R
