5|$|Hank Mitchell and {{his wife}} Sarah live in rural Minnesota. One of the town's few college graduates, Hank works in a feed mill, while his wife is a librarian. When Hank, his older, {{socially}} challenged brother Jacob and Jacob's friend Lou chase a fox into the woods, they stumble upon a crashed airplane. Hank decides to look inside the plane where he discovers a dead pilot and a bag containing $4.4 million in $100 bills. He suggests turning the money in but is persuaded not to by Jacob and Lou. Hank then proposes that he <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> safe at his house {{until the end of}} winter. Sheriff Carl Jenkins drives by the area and notices the three men after they hide the money in Jacob's pick-up truck. Jacob mentions hearing a plane in the area to avoid suspicion. After Carl leaves, the three men decide to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> a secret, but Hank breaks the pact when he reveals the discovery to Sarah.|$|E
5|$|UBS France {{executive}} Patrick de Fayet {{was among}} three local branch executives being investigated. UBS wealth management bankers allegedly {{broke the law}} by enabling French taxpayers to hide their assets in UBS-controlled offshore assets to avoid paying taxes. The bankers undertook to direct their French clients' assets to UBS's Switzerland operation, rather than <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> in France. UBS set aside approximately US$2 billion in expected liability for its currency rigging and French tax evasion cases.|$|E

The three men {{go to great lengths}} to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> a secret but begin to doubt each other's trust, resulting in lies, deceit and murder.|$|E

5|$|Million Dollar Challenge is a {{poker game}} show where amateur poker players attempt to defeat celebrities, {{professional}} poker players and, eventually, Daniel Negreanu {{in order to}} win the show's grand prize, $1 million. In the first round, the amateur (with Negreanu at their side, acting as their coach and lending advice) must defeat a celebrity such as Jayde Nicole, Jerome Bettis, Joanna Krupa, John Salley or Tito Ortiz. If the contestant is able to defeat the celebrity the contestant wins a trip to the Bahamas and advances to the second round. In the second round, the amateur (with Negreanu now helping them from a sound proof booth, giving them advice through a listening device in the amateur's ear) must defeat a professional poker player such as Vanessa Rousso, Barry Greenstein, Joe Cada or Chris Moneymaker. If the contestant is able to defeat the professional the contestant wins $25,000 in addition to the trip to the Bahamas. At this point, the amateur has a decision to make. <b>Keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> and walk away $25,000 richer, or risk the money (the trip is still theirs to keep) and play Daniel Negreanu heads-up for $100,000, knowing that if they lose they walk away with nothing but the trip to the Bahamas. In the season finale, the champions from each episode compete against each other in a sit-n-go tournament, the winner of which plays Negreanu for $1 million.|$|E
25|$|Counterfeiting paper notes {{has always}} been a problem, {{especially}} since the introduction of color photocopiers and computer image scanners. Numerous banks and nations have incorporated many types of countermeasures in order to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> secure; however, extremely sophisticated counterfeit notes known as superdollars have been detected in recent years.|$|E

5000|$|The {{number of}} {{optional}} types has increased since 1983; Georgia currently offers many specialty or optional license plates, most at an extra cost to motorists.

25|$|Rocky {{tries to}} escape, but Kang stops and kills him. Kang is then confronted by General Han Yu Kim (Mako) of the North Korean army, the mastermind behind the counterfeit/laundering scam. Rocky had betrayed Kim, electing to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> for himself rather than sending {{it back to}} North Korea. With Rocky now dead, the only person {{blocking}} Kim's {{plans to use the}} money for his army is Kang. They fight, and if Kim wins, he escapes before the police arrive. If Kang wins, Kim is defeated and Kang is finally able to put his father's disappearance behind him.|$|E
25|$|On 22 June 2017, Theresa May {{stated in}} the House of Commons that anyone {{affected}} by the tragedy, regardless of their immigration status, would be entitled to support, including healthcare services and accommodation. No immigration checks would be performed on those affected. (Two weeks later, however, the government said that anyone coming forward {{would be subject to}} normal immigration rules, including the possibility of deportation, after twelve months.) May added that it was important for those receiving payments from the fund to understand that they could <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> – they would not have to pay it back, and it would not impact their entitlement to any other benefits.|$|E
25|$|These {{examples}} show that, in {{the absence}} of effective legal tender laws, Gresham's Law works in reverse. If given the choice of what money to accept, people will transact with money they believe to be of highest long-term value. However, if not given the choice, and required to accept all money, good and bad, they will tend to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> of greater perceived value in their possession, and pass on the bad money to someone else. In short, {{in the absence}} of legal tender laws, the seller will not accept anything but money of certain value (good money), while the existence of legal tender laws will cause the buyer to offer only money with the lowest commodity value (bad money) as the creditor must accept such money at face value.|$|E

5000|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the collaborative writing process can include problems with series or sequels to successful books, if one partner has other commitments or is {{bored with the}} project, then losses, delays and pressure on the relationship may occur. The Association of Authors' Representatives recommends that [...] "a collaboration agreement must deal with termination of the collaboration: How the collaborators can part ways, who <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> who <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> rights to the material".|$|R
50|$|The rest of {{the gang}} members hold McClain {{accountable}} for <b>the</b> lost <b>money</b> and demand that he retrieve it. Brill quickly solves the murder and {{is well aware of}} the connection to the robber. He kills Sutro, but <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> for himself. With Ellie's murderer identified, but still no trace of <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> <b>the</b> gang members all turn on McClain, assuming he's hiding it. This leads to a confrontation that ends with the deaths of Negli and Gladys.|$|R
25|$|The Islanders {{remained}} competitive for {{the rest}} of the decade, even as some of the stars from the Cup teams departed. As the decade wore on, Pickett began to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> from the team's cable deal rather than reinvest it in the team as he had done in years past. Although it did not become clear immediately, the lack of funds limited Torrey's ability to replace all of the departing talent. In the 1984–85 NHL season, the Islanders slipped to third in their division, followed by similar results in the 1985–86 and 1986–87 seasons. They began facing stiff competition from division rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, who eliminated the Islanders in the Patrick Division Finals in 1985 and 1987, and the Washington Capitals, who swept the Islanders' 1986 first round series, the team's first exit without winning a playoff round since 1978.|$|E
25|$|Poirot meets Sir Joseph {{and offers}} two alternatives: prosecute the {{criminal}} (whom he doesn't name), {{in which case}} he will lose his money, or just {{take the money and}} call the case closed. The greedy Sir Joseph agrees to the latter option and takes Poirot's cheque. The detective turns the conversation round to murder cases and tells a rattled Sir Joseph that he reminds him of a Belgian murderer who poisoned his wife to marry his secretary. Poirot's meaning is quite clear and the shaken man gives Poirot his cheque back, telling him to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> Poirot sends it back to the Misses Carnaby, telling them that it is the final contribution to their fund before it is wound up. Meanwhile, Lady Hoggin tells her relieved husband that her tonic no longer tastes so bitter.|$|E
25|$|Bjørn Jarle Rødberg Larsen, {{treasurer}} of Oslo AUF from 1992 to 1994, had at first denied {{to testify in}} the case, after advice from his defense attorney, but chose to change his mind. He told the court that the Oslo Labour Party pressured the Oslo AUF to maintain high membership numbers, {{in order to maintain}} their strong influence within AUF. He also told the court that the four accused members tried to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> advancements a secret, because they all knew that the practice was illegal. He also admitted that the leadership of AUF in the years between 1992 and 1994 conspired to inflate membership numbers in order to receive higher government subsidies. The leadership regularly paid membership fees for those members who did not pay their fees. In 1993, they also decided to pay membership fees for people who had never expressed any desire to be members of AUF. He also admitted that the four of them met at Hornslien's parliament office to discuss the situation after Verdens Gang broke the story.|$|E

500|$|By May 1992, Endara's public {{approval}} rating {{had fallen from}} its initial 70% to only 10%. The Associated Press later described Endara's administration as being [...] "tarnished by scandal". Among other financial scandals, Endara's wife Ana Mae Diaz was accused of reselling food that had been donated by Italy {{on the streets of}} Panama City. In 1992, Diaz won $125,000 in the national lottery and indicated that she intended to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> rather than donating it; the incident was also cited {{as an example of the}} Endara's administration's lack of concern for Panama's poor.|$|E
500|$|Cleveland viewed Native Americans as wards of the state, {{saying in}} his first inaugural address that [...] "his {{guardianship}} involves, on our part, efforts {{for the improvement of}} their condition and enforcement of their rights." [...] He encouraged the idea of cultural assimilation, pushing for the passage of the Dawes Act, which provided for distribution of Indian lands to individual members of tribes, rather than having them continued to be held in trust for the tribes by the federal government. While a conference of Native leaders endorsed the act, in practice the majority of Native Americans disapproved of it. Cleveland believed the Dawes Act would lift Native Americans out of poverty and encourage their assimilation into white society. It ultimately weakened the tribal governments and allowed individual Indians to sell land and <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E
500|$|Because of {{his many}} {{absences}} from home, on parliamentary and other business, Richard Cobden was a somewhat remote figure to his daughters, although his letters indicate that he felt warmly towards them and that he wished to direct their political education. In later years they would all acknowledge his influence over their ideas. Both parents impressed on the girls their responsibilities for the poor in the local community; Jane Cobden's 1864 diary records visits to homes and workhouses. She and her younger sister Anne, at the ages of 12 and 10 respectively, taught classes in the local village school. [...] The girls were encouraged by their father to contribute what money they possessed to relieve local poverty: [...] "Do not <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>money...</b> as you have now made up your minds {{to give it to}} poor sufferers, let your own neighbours have it. Your Mama will tell you how to dispose of it, and tell me all about it".|$|E
50|$|The next afternoon, Amy {{arrives at}} the brownstone with $20,000 in hundred-dollar bills — a retainer. Archie parks Amy in the front room, {{explains}} the situation to Nero Wolfe, and introduces her. Wolfe wants reassurance that <b>the</b> <b>money</b> is in Amy's possession legally. Amy says that her mother's death has brought to light the fact that Elinor Denovo had received $1,000 a month since Amy was born—a total of $264,000—and that this money is from Amy's father. She recites her mother's letter verbatim. Wolfe <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> but only for safekeeping pending Archie's verification of the letter.|$|R

500|$|Kenny Stabler was not {{the only}} NFL player that the Americans signed to {{contracts}} but who never played for the WFL team. [...] Detroit Lions wide receiver Ron Jessie was paid a $45,000 signing bonus in early 1974, to begin playing for the Americans in the 1975 season after completing his option year with the Lions. [...] Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Jethro Pugh and offensive tackle Rayfield Wright each received a $75,000 signing bonus, with Pugh set to start playing for the Americans in 1976 and Wright in 1977.

[...] However, when the team folded both the WFL commissioner and a federal judge ruled that the player contracts had all been voided. [...] These players remained in the NFL, playing neither for the Americans nor the successor Birmingham Vulcans team. Bill Putnam and his Alabama Football, Inc., still the legal owners of what little remained of the Americans' assets, made headlines through the late 1970s when he sued these NFL players claiming [...] "breach of contract" [...] to recover the signing bonus money.

500|$|Following Russell's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} [...] "The S'more, the Merrier" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were {{required}} to walk back and forth transferring cups of hot chocolate to a jar {{on the opposite side}} of the backyard. The first HouseGuest to fill up their jar and claim the ball inside would be the winner of the competition. Kevin was the winner. Despite making a deal with him the previous week, Kevin and Natalie later made a plan to backdoor Jeff as they saw him as their biggest threat. Though this was his plan, Kevin and Natalie also debated taking out Michele, and thus feared that Jeff could win the Power of Veto and save Jordan if she were to be nominated; should Jeff use the Power of Veto on Jordan, it would force Kevin to nominate Natalie for eviction. On Day 55, Kevin chose to nominate Jeff and Michele for eviction. Later that day, Kevin discovered a secret room in the Head of Household bedroom known as Pandora's Box; upon entering the room, he discovered a box and learned that placing his hand inside the box would release $10,000 into the house. He did so, and became locked inside the box while the money fell into the backyard; the HouseGuests were able to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> and {{were required to}} find a key to unlock Kevin from the room. On Day 56, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Morphomatic" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to correctly figure out which two faces of the HouseGuests made up a set of alien faces. The HouseGuest who finished the competition in the fastest amount of time was the winner. Michele was the winner of the Power of Veto. On Day 58, Michele chose to use the Power of Veto to remove herself from the block, with Jordan being nominated in her place. On Day 61, Jeff became the eighth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house when Kevin cast a tiebreaker vote in Jordan's favor. He became the fourth member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E

One is sterilisation, in which highly valued assets are sold {{at the same time}} that the weaker assets are purchased, which <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> supply neutral. Another technique is simply to accept the bad assets as long-term collateral (as opposed to short-term repo swaps) to be held until their market value stabilises. This would imply, as a quid pro quo, adjustments in taxation and expenditure in the economies of the weaker states to improve the perceived value of the assets.|$|R
