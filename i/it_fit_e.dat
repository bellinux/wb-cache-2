40|$|A presente investigação visou estudar as relações existentes entre P-O Fit, ou seja o ajuste entre os valores pessoais e organizacionais e satisfação no trabalho <b>e</b> P-O <b>Fit</b> <b>e</b> intenção de turnover. Ainda, se pretendeu demonstrar se a identificação organizacional pode ter influência nestas relações. A amostra foi constituída por 80 indivíduos que trabalham em empresas, tanto no setor privado como no público. Os participantes responderam a um questionário composto pelas seguintes escalas: Inventário de Valores Organizacionais (Tamayo, Mendes & Paz, 2000), Portrait Values Questionnaire (Schwartz, 1992), Perceived Person–Organization Fit (Cable & Judge, 1996), Escala de Identificação Organizacional (Mael & Asforth, 1992), Job Satisfaction Survey (Spector, 1997), Escala de Bem-Estar Afetivo no Trabalho (Katwyk, Fox, Spector & Kelloway, 2000), Anticipated Turnover Scale (Hinshaw, Atwood, Gerber & Erickson, 1987, cit. in Gaspar, 1990). Os resultados mostram que a identificação exerce um papel moderador na relação entre o P-O <b>Fit</b> <b>e</b> a satisfação no trabalho e na relação entre o P-O <b>Fit</b> <b>e</b> a intenção de turnover. Mostrou-se também que a satisfação tem um papel mediador na relação entre o P-O <b>Fit</b> <b>e</b> a intenção de turnover. This {{research}} {{aimed to}} study the relationship between P-O Fit, the congruence between personal and organizational values, and job satisfaction and P-O Fit and turnover intentions. Moreover, it was tested whether organizational identification influences these relationships. The sample consisted of 80 participants working at companies in {{both private and public}} sector. The questionnaire was composed of the following scales: Inventory of Organizational Values (Tamayo, Mendes & Paz, 2000), Portrait Values Questionnaire (Schwartz, 1992) Perceived Person-Organization Fit (Cable & Judge, 1996), Organizational Identification Scale (Mael & Asforth, 1992), Job Satisfaction Survey (Spector, 1997), Job-Related Affective Well-Being Scale (Katwyk, Fox, Spector & Kelloway, 2000) Anticipated Turnover Scale (Hinshaw, Atwood, Gerber & Erickson, 1987, cit. in Gaspar, 1990). The results show that identification plays a moderating role in the relationship between P-O Fit and job satisfaction and the relationship between P-O Fit and turnover intentions. Also, satisfaction has a mediating role in the relationship between P-O Fit and turnover intention. Orientação: Mauro Bianch...|$|R
