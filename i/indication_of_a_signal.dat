40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the search for}} the Higgs boson which is predicted by the Standard Model of Particle Physics in order to endow bosons and fermions with their observed masses. The search is performed using data taken by the L 3 experiment at the Large Electron Positron Collider (LEP) during the years 1998 until 2000. An integrated luminosity of 628 /pb was collected in a center-of-mass energy range from 189 GeV to 209 GeV. This thesis is devoted to the analysis of the reaction e+ e- [...] > HZ [...] > bb- qq-. The observed four-jet final state results from the Higgs boson decaying to a bb- pair and a hadronic Z decay. It is the most likely of various possible Higgs decay channels. After an initial selection requiring high multiplicity, four-jet-like events a neural network is used to separate signal from background. It exploits b-tagging information together with kinematic and event shape variables. Subsequently the neural network output is folded with the reconstructed Higgs mass from a kinematic fit {{in order to get a}} Higgs mass dependent final discriminant which is used to search for the Higgs boson for each mass hypothesis in the range between 85 GeV and 115 GeV. The number of observed candidates in the analyzed channel is in good agreement with the expectation for the Standard Model background. To determine a lower limit on the mass of the Higgs boson a likelihood ratio is used. This procedure optimizes the discovery potential of the analysis in the sense that it both maximizes the probability to discover an existent signal and the probability to exclude a false signal hypothesis. By applying this method a lower limit on the mass of the Higgs boson of m_H > 106. 4 GeV has been set at 95 % confidence level. If a 100 GeV Higgs boson had existed it would have been observed with a significance of 3. 4 sigma. Although the L 3 four-jet analysis reveals no <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal,</b> the LEP combined results show a preference for a Higgs boson with a mass of 115. 6 GeV. The main origin of this 2. 1 sigma excess compared to the background expectation is the ALEPH four-jet channel.

Here, we studied the effects murine Trop 2 (mTrop 2) exerted on tumor cellular functions and some of the signaling mechanisms activated by this oncogene. Results mTrop 2 expression significantly increased tumor cell proliferation at low serum concentration, migration, foci formation and anchorage-independent growth. These in vitro characteristics translated to increased tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic cancer murine models and also led to increased liver metastasis. mTrop 2 expression also increased the levels of phosphorylated ERK 1 / 2 mediating cell cycle progression by increasing the levels of cyclin D 1 and cyclin E as well as downregulating p 27. The activation of ERK was also observed in human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells and colorectal adenocarcinoma cells overexpressing human Trop 2.

It is intriguing that the IceCube experiment has recently reported two PeV neutrino events with energies that may be equal up to experimental uncertainties, and which have <b>a</b> probability <b>of</b> being <b>a</b> background fluctuation estimated {{to be less than}} a percent. Here we explore prospects for these events to be the first <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> monochromatic line <b>signal</b> from dark matter. While measurable annihilation signatures would seem to be impossible at such energies, we discuss the dark matter quantum numbers, effective operators, and lifetimes which could lead to <b>an</b> appropriate <b>signal</b> from dark matter decays. We will show that the set of possible decay operators is rather constrained, and will focus on several viable candidates which could explain the IceCube events; R-parity violating gravitinos, hidden sector gauge bosons, and singlet fermions in an extra dimension. In essentially all cases we find that a PeV neutrino line signal from dark matter would be accompanied by a potentially observable continuum spectrum of neutrinos rising towards lower energies.

40|$|The largest {{catalog of}} strong MgII {{absorbers}} to date {{derived from the}} Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar spectra was employed to describe statistical properties of absorbers and their clustering along sight lines as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> redshift and rest equivalent width (REW). The association of SDSS galaxies with MgII systems was investigated by cross-correlating the spectroscopic MgII catalog with the imaging catalog of galaxies surrounding quasar sight lines. The quasar-galaxy cross-correlation was estimated for various subsets in redshift, REW, and magnitude intervals as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> impact parameter from quasar sight lines. The distribution of luminosities of MgII-absorbing galaxies was described using a background subtraction method. Photometric properties of absorbing galaxies, such as colors and integrated fluxes in various bands, were analyzed as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> REW. An analytical model for the absorbers was developed and constrained by the statistical properties of the MgII catalog and observational features of high-redshift galaxies from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), which were also employed to determine the evolution of absorption cross-section. Clustering was detected for absorbers separated by less than 500 km/s, with <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stronger <b>signal</b> at larger REW and growing clustering at lower redshift. An anti-correlation feature was found at absorption pair separations of about 1000 km/s. The shallow nature of SDSS galaxy imaging limited the analysis of MgII-galaxy associations to lower redshift absorbers and only the bright end of the luminosity distribution of absorbing galaxies was recovered. The quasar-galaxy cross-correlation showed evidence for a MgII-galaxy association and was stronger and steeper at small impact parameters for larger REW absorption lines. Stronger absorbers {{were found to be}} associated with bluer and less luminous galaxies, while weaker systems were associated with redder and more luminous galaxies. The cross-section of absorbers inferred from the distribution of HUDF galaxies confirmed smaller impact parameters and increasing evolutionary effects for stronger absorbers. Modeling absorbers indirectly via HUDF galaxies led to a versatile tool able to guide measurements toward <b>a</b> deeper understanding <b>of</b> the origins of MgII absorption...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} the dark matter in the {{universe}} is reviewed. <b>A</b> short history <b>of</b> the subject is given, {{and several of the}} most obvious particle candidates for dark matter are identified. Particular focus is given to weakly interacting, massive particles (WIMPs) of which the lightest supersymmetric particle is an interesting special case and a usful template. The three detection methods: in particle accelerators, by direct detection of scattering in terrestrial detectors, and indirect detection of products from dark matter particle annihilation in the galactic halo, are discussed and their complementarity is explained. Direct detection experiments have revealed some possible <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dark matter <b>signal,</b> but the situation is quite confusing at the moment. Very recently, also indirect detection has entered a sensitivity region where some particle candidates could be detectable. Indeed, also here there are some (presently non-conclusive) <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> possible dark matter <b>signals,</b> like <b>an</b> interesting structure at 130 GeV gamma-ray energy found in publicly available data from the Fermi-LAT space detector. The future of the field will depend on whether WIMPs are indeed the dark matter, something that may realistically be probed in the next few years. If this exciting scenario turns out to be true, we can expect <b>a</b> host <b>of</b> other, complementary experiments in the coming decade. If it is not true, the time scale and methods for detection will be much more uncertain. Comment: To be published in Annalen der Physik special issue DARK MATTER edited by M. Bartelmann and V.

40|$|The {{dietary intake}} of {{saturated}} fatty acids (SAFA) {{is associated with a}} modest increase in serum total cholesterol, but not with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Replacing dietary SAFA with carbohydrates (CHO), notably those with a high glycaemic index, is associated with an increase in CVD risk in observational cohorts, while replacing SAFA with polyun{{saturated fatty acids}} (PUFA) is associated with reduced CVD risk. However, replacing <b>a</b> combination <b>of</b> SAFA and trans-fatty acids with n- 6 PUFA (notably linoleic acid) in controlled trials showed no <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> benefit and <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> toward increased coronary heart disease risk, suggesting that n- 3 PUFA may be responsible for the protective association between total PUFA and CVD. High CHO intakes stimulate hepatic SAFA synthesis and conservation of dietary SAFA. Hepatic de novo lipogenesis from CHO is also stimulated during eucaloric dietary substitution of SAFA by CHO with high glycaemic index in normo-insulinaemic subjects and during hypocaloric high-CHO/low-fat diets in subjects with the metabolic syndrome. The accumulation of SAFA stimulates chronic systemic low-grade inflammation through its mimicking of bacterial lipopolysaccharides and/or the induction of other pro-inflammatory stimuli. The resulting systemic low-grade inflammation promotes insulin resistance, reallocation of energy-rich substrates and atherogenic dyslipidaemia that concertedly give rise to increased CVD risk. We conclude that avoidance of SAFA accumulation by reducing the intake of CHO with high glycaemic index is more effective in the prevention of CVD than reducing SAFA intake per se...|$|R
40|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens uses a type IV {{secretion}} {{system to}} deliver a nucleoprotein complex and effector proteins directly into plant cells. The single-stranded DNA-binding protein VirE 2, the F-box protein VirF and VirE 3 are delivered into host cells via this VirB/D 4 encoded translocation system. VirE 1 functions as <b>a</b> chaperone <b>of</b> VirE 2 by regulating its efficient translation and preventing VirE 2 -VirE 2 aggregation in the bacterial cell. We analyzed whether the VirE 1 chaperone is also essential for transport recognition of VirE 2 by the VirB/D 4 encoded type IV secretion system. In addition, we assayed whether translocation of VirF and VirE 3, which also forms part of the virE operon, {{is affected by the}} absence of VirE 1. We employed the earlier developed CRAFT (Cre recombinase Reporter Assay For Translocation) assay to detect transfer of Cre::Vir fusion proteins from A. tumefaciens into plants, monitored by stable reconstitution <b>of</b> <b>a</b> kanamycin resistance marker, and into yeast, screened by loss of the URA 3 gene. We show that the C-terminal 50 amino acids of VirE 2 and VirE 3 are sufficient to mediate Cre translocation into host cells, confirming earlier <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> C-terminal transport <b>signal.</b> This transfer was independent of {{the presence or absence of}} VirE 1. Besides, the translocation efficiency of VirF is not altered in a virE 1 mutant. The results unambiguously show that the VirE 1 chaperone is not essential for the recognition of the VirE 2 transport signal by the transport system and the subsequent translocation across the bacterial envelope into host cells.

40|$|Galaxy {{clusters}} {{are dominated}} by dark matter, and may have <b>a</b> larger proportion <b>of</b> surviving substructure than, e. g, field galaxies. Due {{to the presence of}} galaxy clusters in relative proximity and their high dark matter content, they are promising targets for the indirect detection of dark matter via Gamma-rays. Indeed, dedicated studies of sets of up to 100 clusters have been made previously, so far with no clear <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dark matter <b>signal.</b> Here we report on Gamma-ray observations of some 26, 000 galaxy clusters based on Pass- 7 Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data, with clusters selected from the Tully 2 MASS Groups catalog. None of these clusters is significantly detected in Gamma-rays, and we present Gamma-ray flux upper limits between 20 GeV and 500 GeV. We estimate the dark matter content of each of the clusters in these catalogs, and constrain the dark matter annihilation cross section, by analyzing Fermi-LAT data from the directions of the clusters. We set some of the tightest cluster-based constraints to date on the annihilation of dark matter particles with masses between 20 GeV and 500 GeV for annihilation to a gamma-ray line. Our cluster based constraints are not yet as strong as bounds placed using the Galactic Center, although an uncertainty still exists regarding the "boost factor" from cluster substructure, where we have chosen a rather conservative value. Our analysis, given this choice of possible boost, is not yet sensitive enough to fully rule out typical realistic DM candidates, especially if the gamma-ray line is not a dominant annihilation mode.
