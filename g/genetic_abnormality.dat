5|$|FH is {{classified}} as a type 2 familial dyslipidemia. There are five types of familial dyslipidemia (not including subtypes), and each are classified from both the altered lipid profile and by the <b>genetic</b> <b>abnormality.</b> For example, high LDL (often due to LDL receptor defect) is type 2. Others include defects in chylomicron metabolism, triglyceride metabolism, and metabolism of other cholesterol-containing particles, such as VLDL and IDL.|$|E
5|$|Moe is {{impressed}} by Homer's ability to absorb severe punishment and suggests he take up boxing, with Moe – a former boxer himself – as his trainer and manager. Marge is annoyed by the idea, but a medical test diagnoses Homer {{with a rare}} <b>genetic</b> <b>abnormality</b> effectively rendering him near-invulnerable to knockout punches. While training, it is discovered that Homer is a weak puncher, and is extremely out of shape. Moe strategizes that Homer should stand still in the ring and let his opponents exhaust themselves trying to knock him out, and then knock them down with a tap.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphisms (normal variations) in {{particular}} genes {{have been linked}} with {{an increased risk of}} severe dengue complications. Examples include the genes coding for the proteins known as TNFα, mannan-binding lectin, CTLA4, TGFβ, DC-SIGN, PLCE1, and particular forms of human leukocyte antigen from gene variations of HLA-B. A common <b>genetic</b> <b>abnormality,</b> especially in Africans, known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, appears to increase the risk. Polymorphisms in the genes for the vitamin D receptor and FcγR seem to offer protection against severe disease in secondary dengue infection.|$|E

5|$|Embryos {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the <b>genetic</b> <b>abnormality,</b> can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is {{compared with that of}} the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E

40|$|Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is an {{aggressive}} blood cancer {{caused by the}} proliferation of immature myeloid cells. The <b>genetic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> underlying AML affect signal transduction pathways, transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers. In solid tumours, it is emerging that the genetic landscape of the tumour has a direct effect on the anti-tumour immune responses and response to immunotherapeutic treatment. However, there remains little information as to whether <b>genetic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> affect anti-leukemic immune responses. This review discusses current knowledge of AML antigens and immune responses to AML with a particular focus {{on the role of}} T cells and natural killer cells.

25|$|Many {{patients}} with myotubular myopathy die in infancy prior to receiving a formal diagnosis.

25|$|The <b>genetic</b> <b>abnormality</b> {{associated}} with the X-linked form of myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) was first localized in 1990 to the X chromosome at site Xq28. MTM1 codes for the myotubularin protein, a highly conserved lipid phosphatase involved in cellular transport, trafficking and signalling. Approximately 80% of males with myotubular myopathy diagnosed by muscle biopsy have mutations in MTM1, and about 7% of these mutations are genetic deletions.|$|E
25|$|X-linked myotubular {{myopathy}} was traditionally a fatal {{condition of}} infancy, with {{life expectancy of}} usually less than two years. There appears to be substantial variability in the clinical severity for different genetic abnormalities at that same MTM1 gene. Further, published cases show significant differences in clinical severity among relatives with the same <b>genetic</b> <b>abnormality</b> at the MTM1 gene. Most truncating mutations of MTM1 cause a severe and early lethal phenotype, while some missense mutations are associated with milder forms and prolonged survival (up to 54 years).|$|E
25|$|A {{small number}} of melanistic (all-black) Malayan tapirs have been observed.

40|$|Multiple myeloma is a {{malignant}} tumour of plasma cells {{with a median}} survival of two to three years.

25|$|The {{classic example}} of {{targeted}} development is imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a small molecule which inhibits a signaling molecule kinase. The <b>genetic</b> <b>abnormality</b> causing chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) {{has been known for}} a long time to be a chromosomal translocation creating an abnormal fusion protein, kinase BCR-ABL, which signals aberrantly, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of the leukemia cells. Imatinib precisely inhibits this kinase. Unlike so many other anti-cancer agents, this pharmaceutical was no accident. Brian Druker, working in Oregon Health & Science University, had extensively researched the abnormal enzyme kinase in CML. He reasoned that precisely inhibiting this kinase with a drug would control the disease and have little effect on normal cells. Druker collaborated with Novartis chemist Nicholas Lydon, who developed several candidate inhibitors. From these, imatinib was found to have the most promise in laboratory experiments. First Druker and then other groups worldwide demonstrated that when this small molecule is used to treat patients with chronic-phase CML, 90% achieve complete haematological remission. It is hoped that molecular targeting of similar defects in other cancers will have the same effect.|$|E
500|$|The {{two most}} {{commonly}} used classification schemata for AML are the older French-American-British (FAB) system and the newer World Health Organization (WHO) system. According to the widely used WHO criteria, the diagnosis of AML is established by demonstrating involvement of more than 20% of the blood and/or bone marrow by leukemic myeloblasts, except in the three best prognosis forms of acute myeloid leukemia with recurrent genetic abnormalities (t(8;21), inv(16), and t(15;17)) in which {{the presence of the}} <b>genetic</b> <b>abnormality</b> is diagnostic irrespective of blast percent. The French–American–British (FAB) classification is a bit more stringent, requiring a blast percentage of at least 30% in bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) for the diagnosis of AML. AML must be carefully differentiated from [...] "preleukemic" [...] conditions such as myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative syndromes, which are treated differently.|$|E

40|$|Southern blot {{hybridization}} {{was used}} to detect the rearrangement and amplification of five proto-oncogenes (bcl- 2, bcl- 1, c-myc, c-myb and c-Ha-ras) and one tumor suppressor gene (RB- 1) in 55 Japanese patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; 16 with T-cell lymphomas and 39 with B-cell lymphomas (7 follicular and 32 diffuse lymphomas). <b>Genetic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> of the proto-oncogenes were detected in 7 of the 55 (13 %). <b>Genetic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> of bcl- 2 plus other genes were detected in 5 of 7 cases of follicular lymphoma (71 %), rearrangements of bcl- 2 and c-myc, rearrangement of bcl- 2 and amplification of c-myb. <b>Genetic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were observed in only three cases of diffuse lymphoma. In each of 3 cases of B-cell lymphoma, one of the genes, blc- 2 mbr, bcl- 2 mcr and c-myc, was rearranged respectively.

40|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> are {{critical}} prognostic factors for patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma (MM). This retrospective, multicenter study aimed to contribute with the genetic and clinical characterization of MM {{patients in a}} country with continental dimensions such as Brazil. <b>Genetic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were assessed by cIg-fluorescent in situ hybridization (cIg-FISH) in a series of 152 MM patients (median age 55 years, 58. 5 % men). Overall, <b>genetic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were detected in 52. 7 % (80 / 152) of patients. A 14 q 32 rearrangement was detected in 33. 5 % (n= 51), including t(11; 14), t(4; 14) and t(14; 16) in 18. 4, 14. 1, and 1 % of cases, respectively. del(13 q) was identified in 42. 7 % (n= 65) of patients, of whom 49. 2 % (32 / 65) presented a concomitant 14 q 32 rearrangement. del(17 p) had a frequency of 5. 2 % (n= 8). del(13 q) was associated with high plasma cell burden (≥ 50 %, P= 0. 02), and del(17 p) with advanced ISS stages (P= 0. 05) and extramedullary disease (P= 0. 03). t(4; 14) was associated with advanced Durie-Salmon stages (P= 0. 008), renal insufficiency (P= 0. 01) and was more common in patients over 60 years old. This study reports similar frequencies of <b>genetic</b> <b>abnormalities</b> to most series worldwide, whereas the t(14; 16) and del(17 p), two high risk factors for newly diagnosed patients, exhibited lower frequencies.
