5|$|After {{making a}} duck {{in the first}} <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> the match between Tasmania and the touring Australian side in March 1930, members of the Australian side advised Nash to change his stance, stating {{that it was too}} unorthodox to be successful. Nash ignored this advice and {{promptly}} scored 93 in the second <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> the match.|$|E
5|$|He {{was picked}} up by the Montreal Expos in the {{following}} season for only $400,000 and had the worst season of his career. His last game of the season was two <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> relief during extra <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> an all-Canada interleague game (sometimes called the Pearson Cup) won by Toronto on July 2. It {{turned out to be the}} last game of his major league career. On July 15, 1997, Lee Smith announced his retirement.|$|E

2500|$|The initial {{first-class}} {{match was}} [...] at Old Trafford Cricket Ground on 26 and 27 May 1871. In this match the Lancashire batsmen were destroyed {{in their first}} innings by {{the pace of the}} Derbyshire fast bowler, Dove Gregory, who took six wickets for nine runs. They [...] made a record low <b>innings</b> score <b>of</b> 25. Derbyshire replied with 147, and Lancashire failed in their second innings to achieve a combined total that surpassed it. In the return match in August, the club's first at the County Ground, Derbyshire replied with 80 to Lancashire's first <b>innings</b> score <b>of</b> 116, and with 58 to their second <b>innings</b> score <b>of</b> 84.

5|$|A left-arm medium-pace seam bowler, Toshack was {{a member}} of the first-choice team, and played in the first four Test matches before succumbing to a {{persistent}} knee injury. Toshack contained the English batsmen with leg theory in between the new ball bursts of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall. He took 11 wickets in the Tests; his most notable performance was the 5/40 he took in the second <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> the Second Test at Lord's. However, his knee failed in the first <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> the Fourth Test when he took 1/112. He was unable to bowl in the second innings and missed the Fifth Test, marking the end of his Test career.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} major league debut against the Chicago White Sox on August 31, 2005. In eight relief {{appearances}} with the Rangers, he compiled {{a record of}} 0–1, with an ERA of 0.91 in 9.1 <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> work.|$|E

5|$|In December 1959, Illingworth was {{selected}} for the Victoria Colts, a youth team, to play against the New South Wales Colts. Illingworth scored a pair and opened the bowling, taking 1/51 as New South Wales made 278 in their only <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> a drawn match.|$|E
5|$|Richard started {{eight games}} with the Bears in 1973 and posted minor league career-worsts in ERA and hits allowed per nine innings. Despite his poor {{performance}} with the Bears, Richard was again called up by the Astros. Richard entered in the fourth inning of a June 16 game against the St. Louis Cardinals and his idol Bob Gibson. He pitched four <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> one-run ball and three <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> a two-hit game in his next relief outing. Afterwards, the Astros placed Richard in the starting rotation, and {{he made his first}} major league start since July 30 of the previous year. He pitched six solid <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> a one-run ballgame and struck out six while walking three batters. Richard would make his next start four days later. Richard again pitched more than six innings but earned no decision after the Astros' bullpen gave up nine runs during the top of the ninth inning.|$|E
5|$|The West Indies started well, {{winning the}} first Test comfortably by an innings and 93 runs, {{and led by}} 133 runs after the first <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> the second Test. The turning point came in the second <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> this match, as the West Indies were bowled out for 54 (this was their third lowest innings at the time). England won this Test, and they seized the {{initiative}} in the series by winning {{the fourth and fifth}} Tests thanks to Andrew Caddick’s four wicket over and Atherton’s century, to regain the Wisden Trophy 3–1 after a period of 31 years.|$|E

5|$|The lone {{bright spot}} for the Red Sox came in Game 3 at Boston's Fenway Park, in {{what had been a}} much {{anticipated}} pitching match-up of former Red Sox star Roger Clemens, who was now pitching for the Yankees, and Boston ace Pedro Martínez. Martínez struck out twelve and did not allow a run through seven <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> work; Clemens was hit hard, giving up five earned runs and only lasting two <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> a 13–1 Red Sox victory. The Yankees rebounded to win Games 4 and 5, clinching the American League pennant and advancing to the Series, where they swept the Atlanta Braves, (including two 8th-inning comebacks). The loss to Pedro Martínez was the Yankees' only postseason loss, as the team went 11–1.|$|E
5|$|Washbrook {{reached his}} century with the score on 189/1; he reached triple figures {{half an hour}} after tea, having batted for 230 minutes and 16 boundaries. Washbrook avoided cross-batted shots and solidly defended shorter balls from the back foot, and profited from many over-pitched balls, which he drove away for boundaries. It was a welcome return to form for the opener from Lancashire. He had scored six, one, eight, 37 and 11 in his first five <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> the series, and was dropped on 21 in the second <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> the Third Test before {{proceeding}} to an unbeaten 85. After reaching his century, Washbrook began to play more expansively, driving {{in a manner that}} prompted Arlott to compare him to Frank Woolley.|$|E
5|$|After his service, Wensloff {{returned}} to the New York Yankees for the 1947 season. He made his first appearance {{at the start of}} June and pitched despite having a sore arm throughout the season, pitching infrequently. In 11 games with the Yankees, Wensloff compiled a record of 3–1 with a 2.61 ERA and 18 strikeouts in 51⅔ innings pitched, and pitched two <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> one game in the 1947 World Series.|$|E

5|$|Allen was {{unsuccessful}} in the Gentlemen v Players game, but performed effectively {{with the ball}} for Middlesex. He continued to struggle when batting, and his highest <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> the year was 77 runs scored in the end-of-season Scarborough Festival. In total, he scored 281 runs at 17.56 and took 42 wickets at 22.19. He was not invited on the MCC tour of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Astle {{made his}} ODI debut against the West Indies at Eden Park, Auckland in January 1995. His first century came {{the same year}} against India at the Vidharba Cricket Association Ground, Nagpur. Opening the batting, Astle made 114 runs from 128 balls in a match which New Zealand won. He {{followed}} that with another century in the 1996 Cricket World Cup, against England. Astle's match-winning <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> 119 against Pakistan finds a mention in the 100 best ODI <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> all-time by Wisden in 2002. He scored his second century in World Cup, this time against Zimbabwe in the 2003 tournament. His highest ODI total of 145 not out was achieved against the United States during the 2004 Champions Trophy. In ODIs Astle was most successful against India making five centuries. Astle {{ended up in the}} nineties on nine occasions, including twice where he remained not out.|$|E
5|$|Back in England, Trescothick {{was called}} upon to captain England after Michael Vaughan {{sustained}} a knee injury. Although other England captains had seemed to suffer a lack of batting form, the extra authority did not affect Trescothick, and he forged a good partnership with debutant Andrew Strauss against New Zealand. This understanding developed in the second Test with a first-wicket partnership of 153; Trescothick went on to score 132, his sixth Test century. Trescothick's partnerships with Strauss were to average 52.35 in 52 innings. His first century against the West Indies followed in the second Test, and Trescothick became {{the first player to}} make centuries in both <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> a Test match at Edgbaston, and the ninth England player to score a century in each <b>innings</b> <b>of</b> a Test match. Trescothick was again England's best One Day International batsman in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, scoring 261 runs in just four innings, including a century in the final; he also took his fourth ODI wicket.|$|E
