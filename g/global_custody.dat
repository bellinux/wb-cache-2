40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{some of the}} {{key issues}} which arise in the design of Global Systems. Specifically, this thesis is a case study of a <b>Global</b> <b>Custody</b> system currently being implemented at a major international bank based in New York. The <b>Global</b> <b>Custody</b> business includes clearing of trades, accounting of portfolios and reporting on corporate actions for a mix of international securities. At present, this business is largely carried out using error prone and expensive labor intensive methods. The <b>Global</b> <b>Custody</b> system being implemented at the bank promises to dramatically improve the quality of service by permitting direct links to depository systems, real-time, on-line access to aggregated portfolio information and production of custom summary reports for clients. These capabilities will give the bank a unique competitive advantage with respect to its competition. The bank believes that, in the long run, only the low cost providers of high quality service will survive the inevitable shake out in this market and is thus positioning its services to achieve these goals. Three issues [...] Organization, Data Administration and Deployment [...] are presented and analyzed in detail, especially as they relate to the bank's ultimate low-cost service strategy. This thesis examines how the global nature of the system makes these issues more complex and concludes by offering a checklist of issues for any organization contemplating the design or implementation of...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how asymmetric information influences the margins charged by a <b>global</b> <b>custody</b> banks on {{foreign exchange transactions}} with customers. For most such trades, the custodian unilaterally sets the price; the client learns that price only after a delay measured in weeks. We hypothesize that custodial margins widen when customers face greater obstacles to identifying their trading costs. We also hypothesize that the custodian sets prices {{with the intent of}} protecting the ambiguity surrounding the margins themselves. Our data comprise the complete foreign exchange trading record of a mid-sized custody bank during calendar year 2006. Our regression analysis provides strong support for both hypotheses...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} the first rigorous empirical analysis of markups on custodial foreign exchange trades. It finds that they substantially exceed relevant benchmarks such as interbank half-spreads. We trace this to an information asymmetry [...] custodial bank dealers {{know more about}} their prices and bid-ask spreads than their client funds. We also examine the asset managersÂ’ continued heavy reliance on this high-cost approach to trading when alternatives are available with lower markups. We provide evidence that this choice does not reflect ignorance of the cost differential. Analysis relies on the complete foreign exchange trading record of a mid-sized <b>global</b> <b>custody</b> bank during calendar year 2006. ...|$|E
