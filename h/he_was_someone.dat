Bryan Singer saw von Stauffenberg as [...] "very much a humanist", saying, [...] "He understood his role as a colonel, but he also understood that the Nazis were doing terrible, terrible, terrible things." [...] Having directed Superman Returns, Singer compared von Stauffenberg's dual identity as loyal colonel and conspirator to Superman and his civilian identity Clark Kent. Cruise had wanted to work with Singer since they met at the premiere for , and the actor was enticed by the script's background, the truth of which struck him as a surprise. The actor described von Stauffenberg's heroism, [...] "I thought of it in terms of what [...] Stauffenberg represents. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> who realized that he had to take the steps that ultimately cost him his life.... He recognized what was at stake." [...] Cruise felt von Stauffenberg did not think of himself as a hero. The actor prepared for the role for eight months by hiring a researcher, studying history books, and speaking with some of von Stauffenberg's family. Since von Stauffenberg lost his left eye, right hand and two fingers on his left hand in an Allied attack in Tunisia, Cruise affected the same disabilities to practice dressing, moving items and writing. Cruise initially found the eyepatch difficult to work with but acknowledged that von Stauffenberg had to live with this discomfort.|$|E

2500|$|Vedder was a {{close friend}} of late Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman, Chris Cornell. Cornell {{was one of the first}} people Vedder met outside his Pearl Jam bandmates after moving to Seattle in 1990. The two were neighbors for a while and had shared vocal duties in Temple of The Dog. Soundgarden manager Susan Silver {{recalled}} in the 2009 book Grunge Is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music, that Cornell walked Vedder onstage at Pearl Jam (then named Mookie Blaylock)'s second show in Seattle, [...] "Alice in Chains filmed the show at Moore theatre in 1990 and that was the show this new band [...] opened for them. Everyone was still reeling from Andy ’s death... and they hadn’t really played out yet. The band came on and Chris carried Eddie onto the stage – he was on his shoulders. It was one of those super powerful moments, where it was all a big healing for everybody. He came out as this guy who had all the credibility in the world – in terms of people in Seattle – and Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone were loved bands. Andy was such an endearing personality. It was a hard thing to do – to show up after people die. And Chris bringing Eddie out, and pointing at him, as much to say, ‘This is your guy now’. Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready said about their friendship; [...] "Ed was from San Diego and he felt very intimidated in Seattle. Chris really welcomed him. Ed was super, super shy. Chris took him out for beers and told him stories. He was like, [...] "Hey, welcome to Seattle. I love Jeff [...] and Stone [...] I give you my blessing." [...] From then on he was more relaxed. It was one of the coolest things I saw Chris do.". In a 2009 interview with Uncut magazine, Vedder stated that Cornell is [...] "the best singer that we've got on the planet". About the impact that Cornell had in his life, Vedder told a crowd in Alpine Valley before performing [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] with him in September 2011; “I had no idea how he would affect my life and my views on music and my views on friendship and what a big impact he would have. These guys [...] know him much longer than me and his impact is profound”. The friendship between Vedder and Cornell is also featured in the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty. During his solo concert in London on June 6, 2017, Vedder talked for the first time about Cornell since his death on May 18, 2017, saying that [...] "he wasn't just a friend, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>someone</b> I looked up to like my older brother" [...] and [...] "I will live with those memories in my heart and I will love him forever".|$|E

6000|$|To Philip, {{this was}} all a rather serious matter. He felt he was {{responsible}} for having introduced the mysterious Alien, however unwillingly, into the bosom of Robert Monteith's family. Now, Philip was not rich, and Frida was supposed to have [...] "made a good match of it"--that is to say, she had married a man a great deal wealthier than her own upbringing. So Philip, after his kind, thought much of the Monteith connection. He lived in lodgings at Brackenhurst, at a highly inconvenient distance from town, so as to be near their house, and catch whatever rays of reflected glory might fall upon his head like a shadowy halo from their horses and carriages, their dinners and garden-parties. He did not like, therefore, to introduce into his sister's house anybody that Robert Monteith, that moneyed man of oil, in the West African trade, might consider an undesirable acquaintance. But as time wore on, and Bertram's new clothes came home from the tailor's, it began to strike the Civil Servant's mind that the mysterious Alien, though he excited much comment and conjecture in Brackenhurst, was accepted on the whole by local society as rather an acquisition to its ranks than otherwise. He was well off: he was well dressed: he had no trade or profession: and Brackenhurst, undermanned, hailed him as a godsend for afternoon teas and informal tennis-parties. That ineffable air of distinction as of one royal born, which Philip had noticed at once the first evening they met, seemed to strike and impress almost everybody who saw him. People felt he was mysterious, but at any rate <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>Someone.</b> And then he had been everywhere--except in Europe; and had seen everything--except their own society: and he talked agreeably when he was not on taboos: and in suburban towns, don't you know, an outsider who brings fresh blood into the field--who has anything to say we do not all know beforehand--is always welcome! So Brackenhurst accepted Bertram Ingledew before long, as an eccentric but interesting and romantic person.|$|E
