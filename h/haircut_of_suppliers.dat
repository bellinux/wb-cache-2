40|$|Given the {{criticality}} <b>of</b> the <b>supplier</b> {{network and}} the increasing number <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> defaults, automotive OEMs are well advised to actively manage their supplier networks, consider supply risks, and avoid negative and exploit positive consequences <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> defaults. We aim to extend the research on supplier defaults along two dimensions: First, with a few exceptions, previous {{studies have focused on}} the default consequences <b>of</b> individual <b>suppliers.</b> However, since suppliers do not operate in isolation, their financial situation is often interlinked. We argue that default dependence (also default correlation) exists in supplier networks and that OEMs should manage the entire network as a group and consider interdependencies among suppliers. Second, all studies that have considered default dependencies have exclusively modeled positive dependence, i. e., they have assumed that, given two suppliers 1 and 2, the default <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> 2 is positively related to the default <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> 1. In contrast, we model negative default dependence (i. e. scenarios where supplier 2 benefits from the default <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> 1) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} {{the decision}} tree approach {{to determine the}} optimal number <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> in the presence <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> failure risks. Previous proposed models have considered only two states <b>of</b> nature: all <b>suppliers</b> fail to deliver and not all suppliers fail to deliver. In practice, however, there is clearly a partial loss associated with the failure <b>of</b> any individual <b>supplier.</b> We present models that allow a more realistic decision-making process by taking into consideration the independent risks <b>of</b> individual <b>supplier</b> failures when the probability of failure for each <b>of</b> the <b>suppliers</b> is equal {{as well as the}} case where the probability of failure from each <b>of</b> the <b>suppliers</b> is not equal. We also consider various levels <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> failure probability and possible procurement or operating cost savings gained from using less reliable suppliers. The results indicate that when suppliers are highly reliable, sole sourcing is the lowest cost approach under all experimental conditions. However, as the suppliers become less reliable, additional suppliers may be required to obtain the lowest cost. Finally, it was shown that only in the extreme conditions <b>of</b> unreliable <b>suppliers,</b> high loss to operational cost per supplier, and low ability to mitigate the failure from a partial set <b>of</b> <b>suppliers,</b> having a large number <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> is an effective strategy.

40|$|Supply chain {{management}} {{has seen a}} wide application since the 1990 s in satisfying diversified customer demands. To remain competitive on a global scale, manufacturing companies greatly increased the scope of their outsourcing activities.

Previous studies <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> selection show that there are commonly accepted supplier selection criteria. However, there are insufficient studies on the association between the manufacturer's criteria <b>of</b> <b>supplier</b> selection and why it wins orders from its customers.

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the problem <b>of</b> {{selecting}} <b>suppliers</b> for an organisation, where a number <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> have made price offers for supply of items, but have limited capacity. Selecting the cheapest combination <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> is a straightforward matter, but purchasers often have a dual goal of lowering the number <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> they deal with. This second goal makes this issue a bicriteria problem – minimisation of cost and minimisation of the number <b>of</b> <b>suppliers.</b> We present a mixed integer programming (MIP) model for this scenario. Quality and delivery performance are modelled as constraints. Smaller instances of this model may be solved using an MIP solver, but large instances will require a heuristic.
