5|$|There {{has been}} {{occasional}} controversy surrounding triple-doubles made when a player achieves the feat with a late rebound. Players with nine rebounds {{in a game}} have sometimes been accused of deliberately missing a shot {{late in the game}} in order to recover the rebound; a few have <b>even</b> <b>gone</b> so far as shooting off their opponent's basket trying to score a triple-double. To deter this, NBA rules allow rebounds to be nullified if the shot is determined not to be a legitimate scoring attempt.|$|E
25|$|However, not all law {{enforcement}} agencies have been as critical; many CSIs have responded positively to the show's influence and enjoy their new reputation. In the UK, scenes of crime officers now commonly refer to themselves as CSIs. Some constabularies, such as Norfolk, have <b>even</b> <b>gone</b> {{so far as to}} change the name of the unit to Crime Scene Investigation. Also, recruitment and training programs have seen a massive increase in applicants, with a far wider range of people now interested in something previously regarded as a scientific backwater.|$|E
25|$|Other theorems have a known {{proof that}} cannot easily be written down. The most {{prominent}} examples are the four color theorem and the Kepler conjecture. Both of these theorems are only {{known to be}} true by reducing them to a computational search that is then verified by a computer program. Initially, many mathematicians did not accept this form of proof, but {{it has become more}} widely accepted. The mathematician Doron Zeilberger has <b>even</b> <b>gone</b> so far as to claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever proved. Many mathematical theorems can be reduced to more straightforward computation, including polynomial identities, trigonometric identities and hypergeometric identities.|$|E

25|$|In the Rendlesham Forest {{incident}} of December 1980, U.S. military personnel witnessed UFOs near the air base at Woodbridge, Suffolk, {{over a period}} of three nights. On one night the deputy base commander, Colonel Charles I. Halt, and other personnel followed one or more UFOs that were moving in and above the forest for several hours. Col. Halt made an audio recording while this was happening and subsequently wrote an official memorandum summarizing the incident. After retirement from the military, {{he said that he had}} deliberately downplayed the event (officially termed 'Unexplained Lights') to avoid damaging his career. Other base personnel are said to have observed one of the UFOs, which had landed in the forest, and <b>even</b> <b>gone</b> up to and touched it.|$|E
25|$|Jeremiah {{was called}} to prophetic {{ministry}} c. 626BC. Jeremiah was called by YHWH to give prophecy of Jerusalem's destruction that would occur by invaders from the north. This was because Israel had been unfaithful {{to the laws of}} the covenant and had forsaken God by worshiping Baal. The people of Israel had <b>even</b> <b>gone</b> as far as building high altars to Baal in order to burn their children in fire as offerings. This nation had deviated so far from God that they had broken the covenant, causing God to withdraw his blessings. Jeremiah was guided by God to proclaim that the nation of Judah would be faced with famine, plundered and taken captive by foreigners who would exile them to a foreign land.|$|E
25|$|Currently the Fiero has a cult {{following}} {{of owners}} and customizers. While all Fiero models {{are considered to}} be collectible, the 1988 model year is particularly sought after by collectors due to its limited production numbers and vastly improved underpinnings. Because of an abundance of replacement parts available from other General Motors vehicles, there are many upgrades {{that can be done to}} improve performance and reliability of the cars. Additionally, a multitude of different General Motors engines have been installed by enthusiasts, from the Quad-4 engine to the Chevrolet small-block V8 to the Cadillac 4.9L and Northstar V8s. The GM 3800 Supercharged is also a very popular choice, as well as the 3.4L found in the 1993, 1994, or 1995 Camaro/Firebird. One shop in particular that pioneered and now specializes in V8 installations has <b>even</b> <b>gone</b> so far as to install the famed Z06 Corvette powerplant, the 505horsepower LS7, into a Fiero. Installation of the 4.9L V8 or smaller engines is possible with few modifications to the car itself, because Fiero prototypes were tested with a similar small aluminum V8 prior to production. As a result, the engine bay is large enough to accommodate engines of that size.|$|E

She was requisitioned from Norway {{at the beginning of}} World War I, but was not completed until 1918 although she had been launched over three years earlier. On 16 September 1918, before she had <b>even</b> <b>gone</b> into action, she suffered a large fire in one of her 6-inch magazines, and had to be scuttled to prevent an explosion of her main magazines that would have devastated Dover. Her wreck was partially salvaged in 1926, and moved into a position in the northeastern end of the harbour where it would not obstruct traffic. It was subsequently buried by landfill underneath the current car ferry terminal.|$|E
500|$|On release, certain Riesling wines {{reveal a}} {{striking}} petrol note (goût de pétrole in French) which is sometimes described with associations to kerosene, lubricant or rubber. While {{an integral part}} of the aroma profile of mature Riesling and sought after by many experienced drinkers, it may be off-putting to those unaccustomed to it, and those who primarily seek young and fruity aromas in their wine. The negative attitude to petrol aromas in young Riesling, and the preference for fruitier young wines of this variety, seem more common in Germany than in Alsace or on the export market, and some German producers, especially the volume-oriented ones, have <b>even</b> <b>gone</b> so far as to consider the petrol notes a defect which they try to avoid, even at the cost of producing wines that are less suited to extended cellar aging. In that vein, the German Wine Institute has gone so far as to omit the mentioning of [...] "petrol" [...] as a possible aroma on their German-language Wine Aroma Wheel, which is supposed to be specially adapted to German wines, and despite the fact that professor Ann C. Noble had included petrol in her original version of the wheel.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the many questions about the true origins of some of Paul's teachings posed by historical figures as noted above, some modern theologians also hold that the teachings of Paul differ markedly from those of Jesus as found in the Gospels.

Some have <b>even</b> <b>gone</b> so far as to claim that, due to these apparent differences in teachings, that Paul was actually no less than the [...] "second founder" [...] of Christianity (Jesus being its first).|$|E

Lieberman voted for the administration-backed Energy Policy Act of 2005; facing criticism, Lieberman called the bill imperfect but good for Connecticut, citing a saving of $800 million for Connecticut electricity customers. Lieberman has been a vocal critic of Bush's environmental policy.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the focus}} of the festival is Lexington style barbecue, several vendors of the eastern variety can also be found, {{sparking}} mild (and sometimes not so mild) controversy. [...] The battle of Lexington style vs. eastern style has <b>even</b> <b>gone</b> as far as the state government. [...] In 2006, North Carolina House Bill 21 and North Carolina Senate Bill 47 were introduced and would have made the Lexington Barbecue Festival the official barbecue festival of North Carolina.

2500|$|Writing in the Financial Times Italian Jurist Antonio Cassese who was {{the first}} President of the International Criminal Tribunal For the Former Yugoslavia argued that critics of the report were relying {{primarily}} on ad hominem and strawman attacks.

[...] Furthermore, he argued that many critics of the report [...] "have launched personal attacks on Justice Goldstone's character" [...] and some critics have <b>even</b> <b>gone</b> as far as labeling Goldstone, who is Jewish, [...] "an 'anti-Semite' of a kind who 'despise and hate our own people'".|$|E
2500|$|Though Hoyle {{declared}} himself an atheist, this apparent {{suggestion of a}} guiding hand {{led him to the}} conclusion that [...] "a superintellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as with chemistry and biology, and ... there are no blind forces worth speaking about in nature." [...] He would go on to compare the random emergence of even the simplest cell without panspermia to the likelihood that [...] "a tornado sweeping through a junk-yard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein" [...] and to compare the chance of obtaining even a single functioning protein by chance combination of amino acids to a solar system full of blind men solving Rubik's Cubes simultaneously. Those who advocate the intelligent design (ID) belief sometimes cite Hoyle's work in this area to support the claim that the universe was fine tuned in order to allow intelligent life to be possible. Alfred Russel of the Uncommon Descent community has <b>even</b> <b>gone</b> so far as labeling Hoyle [...] "an atheist for ID".|$|E
2500|$|Another legend {{involves}} {{a group of}} teenagers who, while drunk and/or tripping {{on some sort of}} hallucinogen, find what they perceive to be a gnome (sometimes a dwarf, hobgoblin or smurf), capture it, and bring it home. [...] They sleep off the drug's effects, and the next morning they find out that the [...] "gnome" [...] was really a lost (and very frightened) child. [...] Though the story may be told by some tellers in a negative light, it may also have a positive spin in that the teens become unwitting heroes in finding a missing child whose parents (as well as the police) had been unable to find. [...] According to Snopes.com, the legend had first surfaced in 2004, and as of 2007 the legend's truth status remains undetermined and unverifiable.
