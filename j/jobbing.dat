5|$|Equally as important, the Union Stockyards {{were founded}} in 1883. Within {{twenty years of}} the {{founding}} of the Union Stockyards in South Omaha, four of the five major meatpacking companies in the United States were located in Omaha. By the 1950s, half the city's workforce was employed in meatpacking and processing. Meatpacking, <b>jobbing</b> and railroads were responsible for most of the growth in the city from the late 19th century through {{the early decades of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his Shakespearean commitments, Hordern joined the St Pancras People's Theatre, a London-based company partly funded by the theatrical manager Lilian Baylis. Hordern enjoyed his time there, despite the tiresome commute between Sussex and London, and stayed with the company for five years. By the end of 1936 {{he had left his}} sales job in Beaconsfield to pursue a full-time acting career. He moved into a small flat at Marble Arch and became one of the many <b>jobbing</b> actors eager {{to make a name for}} themselves on the London stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Omaha boomed and busted through its early years. Omaha was a {{stopping}} point for settlers and prospectors heading west, either overland or via the Missouri River. The steamboat Bertrand sank north of Omaha {{on its way}} to the goldfields in 1865. Its massive collection of artifacts is on display at the nearby Desoto National Wildlife Refuge. The <b>jobbing</b> and wholesaling district brought new jobs, followed by the railroads and the stockyards. Groundbreaking for the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1863, provided an essential developmental boom for the city. The Union Pacific Railroad was authorized by the U.S. Congress to begin building westward railways in 1862; in January 1866 it commenced construction out of Omaha.|$|E
5|$|Deregulation in the 1980s, {{culminating}} in the Big Bang in 1986, also encouraged the bank to enter the securities business. County Bank, its merchant banking subsidiary formed in 1965, acquired various stockbroking and <b>jobbing</b> firms to create the investment banking arm County NatWest. National Westminster Home Loans was established in 1980 and other initiatives included {{the launch of the}} Piggy Account for children in 1983, the Credit Zone, a flexible overdraft facility on which customers only pay interest (now commonplace, this so-called pink debt was innovative when launched) and the development of the Mondex electronic purse (later sold to MasterCard Worldwide) in 1990. The Action Bank advertising campaign spearheaded a new marketing-led approach to business development. Under the direction of Robin Leigh-Pemberton, later Lord Kingsdown, who became chairman in 1977, the bank also expanded internationally, forming National Westminster Bancorp in the United States of America with a network of 340 branches across two states, National Westminster Bank of Canada and NatWest Australia Bank; and opening branches on the European continent and in the Far East. In 1982, the Frankfurt office of International Westminster Bank merged with Global Bank AG to form Deutsche Westminster Bank. In 1985, Banco NatWest España was formed and National Westminster Bank SA was incorporated in 1988, taking over the bank's six branches in France and Monaco. In 1989, International Westminster Bank was merged into National Westminster Bank by Act of Parliament.|$|E

25|$|After {{a series}} of false starts, {{including}} a spell as a <b>jobbing</b> labourer and another as a clerk in a local government office, Sim's love of and talent for poetry reading won him several prizes and led to his appointment as a lecturer in elocution at the University of Edinburgh in 1925. He also ran his own private elocution and drama school, from which, {{with the help of}} the playwright John Drinkwater, he made the transition to the professional stage in 1930.|$|E
25|$|In 1870 Omaha {{began its}} role as a {{wholesale}} <b>jobbing</b> center for the United States. The wholesale jobber purchased goods directly from the manufacturer, transported these goods via the railroads, and sold them directly to small businesses through traveling salesmen. Omaha jobbers handled a wide variety of wholesale products along the Great Platte River Road and beyond, including groceries, dry goods, hardware, fruits, paper, and liquor. The city created a market house and a food-oriented warehousing district {{to meet the needs of}} this sector of the economy.|$|E
25|$|After SummerSlam 1991, Roma {{left the}} WWF. Hercules {{spent the rest}} of his time in the WWF <b>jobbing</b> again, losing to wrestlers such as the Big Boss Man and Sid Justice, and Intercontinental {{champion}} Bret Hart. His last televised WWF match was against Sid Justice at Madison Square Garden where he was squashed in under a minute. A clearly frustrated and fed up Hercules took a Powerbomb from Justice followed by a three count before no-selling the move by simply getting up unhurt and heading for the locker room.|$|E
25|$|The character's {{overseas}} debut, now as Edna Everage, was in {{the early}} 1960s at comedian Peter Cook's nightclub, The Establishment, in London's West End, where she received a poor review from Bamber Gascoigne, then the drama critic for The Spectator. Barry Humphries cites Cook as being instrumental in launching Edna's UK career. While her first appearances at the Establishment Club was a flop, the mousy Edna being too quiet to please that raucous crowd, a 2016 interviewer William Cook saw the early failure as a blessing, so that Humphries spent the sixties as a <b>jobbing</b> actor rather than as a pampered star.|$|E
25|$|Awesome and Lance Storm were {{defeated}} by Edge and Christian at WWF Invasion, Awesome's first WWF Pay-per-view match. From here Awesome's push slowly declined {{after that and}} he began appearing mostly on WWF's B-shows. He was left off {{the majority of the}} Invasion storyline pay-per-views and was eventually sidelined with an injury in November 2001. Awesome returned to the SmackDown! brand on the July 27, 2002 edition of Velocity where he was defeated by Tajiri. Awesome was a mainstay on SmackDown's B-Show, Velocity for the next 2 months <b>jobbing</b> to wrestlers such as Faarooq, Bull Buchanan, Mark Henry and Funaki.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the First World War in November 1918, Sim was {{released}} from military service. On his return home he told his family that he did not intend to resume his studies at the university, but instead to become an actor. His announcement was so badly received that he left the parental home, and spent about a year in the Scottish Highlands with a group of itinerant <b>jobbing</b> workers. Returning to Edinburgh, he took a post in the burgh assessor's office. In his spare time, he entered poetry reading classes, winning the gold medal for verse speaking at the Edinburgh Music Festival. This led to his engagement to teach elocution at a further education college in Dalry, Edinburgh. He held this post from 1922 to 1924. After taking an advanced training course in his subject, in 1925 he successfully applied to the University of Edinburgh for the post of Fulton Lecturer in Elocution, which he held for five years.|$|E
25|$|Brahms's father, Johann Jakob Brahms (1806–72), {{was from}} the town of Heide in Holstein. The family name was also {{sometimes}} spelt 'Brahmst' or 'Brams', and derives from 'Bram', the German word for the shrub broom. Against the family's will, Johann Jakob pursued a career in music, arriving in Hamburg in 1826, where he found work as a <b>jobbing</b> musician and a string and wind player. In 1830, he married Johanna Henrika Christiane Nissen (1789–1865), a seamstress 17 years older than he was. In the same year he was appointed as a horn player in the Hamburg militia. Eventually he became a double-bass player in the Hamburg Stadttheater and the Hamburg Philharmonic Society. As Johann Jakob prospered, the family moved over the years to ever better accommodation in Hamburg. Johannes Brahms was born in 1833; his sister Elisabeth (Elise) had been born in 1831 and a younger brother Fritz Friedrich (Fritz) was born in 1835. Fritz also became a pianist; overshadowed by his brother he emigrated to Caracas in 1867, and later returned to Hamburg as a teacher.|$|E
25|$|Presented as the Beamish Branch Office of the Northern Daily Mail and the Sunderland Daily Echo, the two storey replica {{building}} {{was built in}} the mid-1980s and represents the trade practices of the era. Downstairs, on the right, is the branch office, where newspapers would be sold directly and distributed to local newsagents and street vendors, and where orders for advertising copy would be taken. Supplementing it is a stationer's shop on the left hand side, with both display items and a small number of gift items on public sale. Upstairs is a <b>jobbing</b> printers workshop, which would not produce the newspapers, but would instead print leaflets, posters and office stationary. Split into a composing area and a print shop, the shop itself has a number of presses - a Columbian built in 1837 by Clymer and Dixon, an Albion dating back to 1863, an Arab Platen of c. 1900, and a Wharfedale flat bed press, built by Dawson & Son in around 1870. Much of the machinery was sourced from the print works of Jack Ascough's of Barnard Castle. Many of the posters seen around the museum are printed in the works, with the operation of the machinery being part of the display.|$|E
25|$|For {{several months}} prior to Survivor Series, Hart and Shawn Michaels had several {{backstage}} arguments including a fight before a house show in Hartford, Connecticut (after Michaels had publicly accused Hart of {{having an affair with}} Sunny), which saw Michaels suspended for two months. After a show in San Jose, California on October 12, 1997, Hart claimed he spoke to Michaels about being professional and trusting one another in the ring. Hart allegedly said he would have no problem losing to Michaels if McMahon requested. Hart also claimed that when Michaels replied that he would never lose to Hart, Bret was shocked and became angry. This led to Hart's outright refusal to lose the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Michaels at the pay-per-view event in Montreal, although in , Hart states to McMahon that he would happily drop the belt but not in Canada. However, in his own autobiography, Michaels refuted Hart's claim, saying that he would have cleanly lost to Hart had storylines demanded so (however others, including Jim Cornette in various shoot interviews, have often refuted this saying that they knew first hand that Michaels had no intention of <b>jobbing</b> to Hart). Michaels also pointed out that he had lost cleanly to Hart several times in the past, most notably in the WWF's first ever ladder match at a Wrestling Challenge taping on July 21, 1992, which would subsequently be made available on multiple Coliseum/WWE Home Video releases and in the main event of Survivor Series 1992. Michaels also lost to Hart in a Steel Cage match in December 1993.|$|E
500|$|Le Mesurier took {{a relaxed}} {{approach}} to acting, saying, [...] "You {{know the way}} you get <b>jobbing</b> gardeners? Well, I'm a <b>jobbing</b> actor... {{as long as they}} pay me I couldn't care less if my name is billed above or below the title". Although Le Mesurier played a wide range of parts, he became known as [...] "an indispensable figure in the gallery of second-rank players which were the glory of the British film industry in its more prolific days". He felt his characterisations owed [...] "a lot to my customary expression of bewildered innocence" [...] and tried to stress for many of his roles that his parts were those of [...] "a decent chap all at sea in a chaotic world not of his own making".|$|E

He was known for playing [...] "an indispensable figure in the gallery of second-rank players which were the glory of the British film industry in its more prolific days". Le Mesurier died in November 1983 from a stomach haemorrhage; his last words before slipping into a coma were: [...] "It's all been rather lovely." [...] The Guardian noted that Le Mesurier gave the impression of an [...] "inimitable brand of bewildered persistence under fire which [...] made his own", while Philip Oakes considered that Le Mesurier single-handedly [...] "made more films watchable, even absorbing than anyone else around".|$|E
500|$|Omaha's pioneer period {{began in}} 1854, {{when the city}} was founded by speculators from {{neighboring}} Council Bluffs, Iowa. The city was founded along the Missouri River, and a crossing called Lone Tree Ferry earned the city its nickname, the [...] "Gateway to the West". Omaha introduced this new West {{to the world in}} 1898, when it played host to the World's Fair, dubbed the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. During the 19th century, Omaha's central location in the United States spurred the city to become an important national transportation hub. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the transportation and <b>jobbing</b> sectors were important in the city, along with its railroads and breweries. In the 20th century, the Omaha Stockyards, once the world's largest, and its meatpacking plants gained international prominence.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his life}} Le Mesurier wrote his autobiography, A <b>Jobbing</b> Actor; the book was {{published}} in 1984, after his death. Le Mesurier's health visibly declined from July 1983 when he was hospitalised for a short time after suffering a haemorrhage. When the condition recurred later in the year he was taken to Ramsgate Hospital; after saying to his wife, [...] "It's all been rather lovely", he slipped into a coma and died on 15 November 1983, aged 71. His remains were cremated, and the ashes buried at the Church of St. George the Martyr, Church Hill, Ramsgate. His epitaph reads: [...] "John Le Mesurier. Much loved actor. Resting." [...] His self-penned death notice in The Times of 16 November 1983 stated that he had [...] "conked out" [...] and that he [...] "sadly misses family and friends".|$|E
500|$|On 16 October 1554, {{according}} to the diary of Henry Machyn, Day was caught {{and sent to the}} Tower of London for printing [...] "naughty books". In the Book of Martyrs, Foxe records statements made in prison to Day by the future martyr John Rogers, [...] "spake being then in prison, to the Printer of this present booke, who then also was layd up for lyke cause of religion". Perhaps because the flight of foreign Protestant workers under Mary was causing a shortage of printers, Day was released the next year and allowed to work again, but only as a <b>jobbing</b> printer. He reunited with Seres (also recently released from prison) to produce works of Catholicism for Catholic printer John Wayland, {{a far cry from the}} Protestant polemics he printed prior to imprisonment. He also served as the official printer of the City of London for two years.|$|E
500|$|Winslet {{is widely}} {{considered}} {{to be among the}} best actresses of her generation. Despite achieving stardom early in her career with the top-grossing Titanic, Winslet has rarely acted in commerce-driven pictures. A journalist for Elle believes that her choices reflect the [...] "soul and attitude of a <b>jobbing</b> actress, trapped in the body of a movie star". Tom Perrotta, the author of Little Children, has said that Winslet “gravitates toward troubling roles in smaller films”, typically those of [...] "thorny, potentially unsympathetic" [...] women. The journalist Mark Harris writes that she specialises in [...] "unsentimentalized, restless, troubled, discontented, disconcerted, difficult women" [...] and John Hiscock of The Daily Telegraph has identified a theme of characters who are free-spirited with a sexual edge to them. Stephen Whitty of NJ.com associates Winslet with [...] "serious, almost despairing material", although he finds it hard to pigeonhole her as an actress.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the speech's poor reception, Pitt effectively promised Cornwallis carte blanche to build support for union. [...] Portland wrote to Cornwallis, [...] "I hope it is unnecessary to assure your excellency that whatever your decisions may be you may depend upon their receiving the unreserved sanction and support of His Majesty's servants." [...] On the basis of these assurances, Cornwallis and Castlereagh developed a plan to coopt or convince enough of the propertied interests that controlled the parliament to support the union. [...] Cornwallis found this task, which occupied much of the next year, to be extremely distasteful: [...] "My occupation is now of the most unpleasant nature, negotiating and <b>jobbing</b> with the most corrupt people under heaven. [...] I despise and hate myself every hour for engaging in such dirty work, and am supported only by the reflection that without an Union the British Empire must be dissolved." [...] The task was made somewhat more pleasant by the arrival of his son for a short visit in July 1799.|$|E
2500|$|Also, in {{the middle}} of the 19th century, there was a {{separate}} development of <b>jobbing</b> presses, small presses capable of printing small-format pieces such as billheads, letterheads, business cards, and envelopes. <b>Jobbing</b> presses were capable of quick set-up (average setup time for a small job was under 15 minutes) and quick production (even on treadle-powered <b>jobbing</b> presses it was considered normal to get 1,000 impressions per hour [...] with one pressman, with speeds of 1,500 iph often attained on simple envelope work). Job printing emerged as a reasonably cost-effective duplicating solution for commerce at this time.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with the}} Go-Jos, {{in the first}} {{eighteen}} months of the Pan's People era the dancers were not a weekly fixture on the programme. However, due to group fan mail and good viewing figures, by 1970 the group was on nearly every week. Their profile was raised {{to such a degree}} they were [...] "transformed from <b>jobbing</b> dancers to Thursday-night superstars". Pay was not high, they were paid the minimum equity rate of £56 per week.|$|E
2500|$|In 1884 the Cincinnati Screw and Tap Company was incorporated. [...] The {{company was}} in the {{business}} of making screws and taps but also began to make machine tools.

2500|$|On August 28, 1906, Capt. O.S. (or O.W.) Hosford bought Gazelle from McLean & Key. [...] Hosford {{intended}} to keep Gazelle on the same route {{that it had been}} running on, from Portland to Linnton. [...] Hosford paid $1,363 for Gazelle, which was considered a bargain price. [...] McLean, the former owner, was to remain in command.

2500|$|The Great Depression saw {{a decline}} in the local economy. [...] Davenport, however, {{continued}} to be an important regional <b>jobbing</b> center with 62.6 percent of the bi-state wholesale business headquartered in the city.

The last building built in the Crescent Warehouse Historic District was an automobile showroom for Vincent J. Neu Oldsmobile in 1950. [...] The single-story building on the northwest corner of East Fourth and Iowa Streets housed the dealership for only nine years when the dealership’s rapid growth forced it to move outside the central business district.|$|E
2500|$|A survey {{published}} by Radio Times magazine in March 2004 revealed that Casualty has featured more future stars {{than any other}} UK soap or drama series.

Discussing her 1993 appearance in Casualty, Winslet told the Radio Times: [...] "In England, it almost seems {{to be part of}} a <b>jobbing</b> actor's training [...] As far as I was concerned it was a great episode, a great part.

2500|$|Macdonald {{traveled}} to Australia to court Crowe's involvement, which averted the film's abandonment after Pitt left. Crowe {{also had to}} negotiate with the studio over shooting dates to avoid a conflict with Nottingham (later renamed [...] "Robin Hood"), which he was due to star in for director Ridley Scott in March2008. Crowe said jumping immediately into the part was similar to immediately taking roles as a <b>jobbing</b> young actor. He had not seen the series, and was unlikely to as one could not compare a six-hour telling of the story to a two-hour adaption. The majority of Crowe's three hours per day in hair and makeup preparation was spent hiding his [...] "extremely long" [...] hair, which he grew for his title role in Robin Hood. During filming in Washington,D.C., Crowe acquired an education in journalism from The Washington Posts Metro editor, R.B. Brenner. Universal president of production Donna Langley said Crowe's performance was a naturalistic one, and claimed State of Play was a different film than the one that would have been made had Pitt remained.|$|E
