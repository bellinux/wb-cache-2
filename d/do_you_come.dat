500|$|In {{the album}} closer, [...] "Street Choir", Morrison repeats the questions, [...] "Why did {{you let me}} down / And now that things are better off / Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> around". Because of these lyrics Heylin wrote that [...] "such songs [...] were spawned by an {{increasing}} awareness of just how badly ripped off he had been". Ken Brooks {{has said that the}} lyric [...] "Move On Up" [...] is another reference on the album to a Curtis Mayfield song. The track prominently features Keith Johnson's trumpet and Morrison's harmonica. Writer Brian Hinton described the lyrics as perversely bitter, while Jon Landau wrote that [...] "Street Choir" [...] was one of the [...] "two or three finest songs" [...] of Morrison's career because of its [...] "musical and poetic energy".|$|E
500|$|The JAMs {{were not}} entirely sure {{what they would have}} said to ABBA if they had been able to meet them. Rockman told NME: [...] "We were hoping to explain [...] to them and that maybe we'd come out of it friends, you know, them {{producing}} our album and us producing theirs—the kind of thing that often happens at these meetings." [...] King Boy: [...] "Yeah, we'd have said, 'Look, you haven't had many hits lately, you don't really wanna bother with all this West End musical shit <b>do</b> <b>you?</b> <b>Come</b> and do the new JAMMS [...] album.'" [...] In 1994, The Guardian looked back on the Swedish sojourn as [...] "a grand, futile, attention-grabbing gesture, the kind that would come to characterise [...] collaborative career... "We were being totally stupid about it" [...] Drummond later acknowledged." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} reveal that Fitz was just imagining the {{presence}} of Simmons due to the injuries he sustained {{at the end of}} the first season, Tancharoen said, [...] "We didn’t want him to come out of that experience unscathed. He clearly suffered major trauma to his body. The lack of oxygen to his brain has to have consequences because that’s how it is in real life. We wanted there to be a price. Basically, he in his own Fitz way had professed his love for her, and then he came out of that. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> out of that experience without any physical damage, there would still be probably a change to their relationship because the feelings are out in the open. But, of course, being the people that we are, we wanted to make it even more painful and compound it." ...|$|E

500|$|On February 18, the seven-man rescue party scaled Frémont Pass (now Donner Pass); as {{they neared}} where Eddy told them the cabins would be, they began to shout. Mrs. Murphy {{appeared}} from {{a hole in the}} snow, stared at them and asked, [...] "Are you men from California, or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> from heaven?" [...] The relief party doled out food in small portions, concerned that it might kill them if the emaciated immigrants overate. All the cabins were buried in snow. Sodden oxhide roofs had begun to rot and the smell was overpowering. Thirteen people at the camps were dead, and their bodies had been loosely buried in snow near the cabin roofs. Some of the emigrants seemed emotionally unstable. Three of the rescue party trekked to the Donners and brought back four gaunt children and three adults. Leanna Donner had particular difficulty walking up the steep incline from Alder Creek to Truckee Lake, later writing [...] "such pain and misery as I endured that day is beyond description." [...] George Donner's arm was so gangrenous that he could not move. Twenty-three people were chosen to go with the rescue party, leaving twenty-one in the cabins at Truckee Lake and twelve at Alder Creek.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, Kidman won {{critical}} {{praise for}} her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in Stephen Daldry's The Hours, which stars Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. Kidman famously wore prosthetics that {{were applied to}} her nose making her almost unrecognisable playing the author during her time in 1920s England, and her bouts with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel, Mrs. Dalloway. The film earned positive notices and several nominations, including for an Academy Award for Best Picture. The New York Times wrote that, [...] "Ms. Kidman, in a performance of astounding bravery, evokes the savage inner war waged by a brilliant mind against a system of faulty wiring that transmits a searing, crazy static into her brain". Kidman won numerous critics' awards, including her first BAFTA, third Golden Globe, and the Academy Award for Best Actress. As the first Australian actress to win an Academy Award, Kidman made a teary acceptance speech {{about the importance of}} art, even during times of war, saying, [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil? Because art is important. And because you believe in what you do and you want to honour that, and it is a tradition that needs to be upheld." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{in terms}} of the more general epistemological implications of common sense, modern philosophy came to use the term common sense like Descartes, abandoning Aristotle's theory. While Descartes had distanced himself from it, John Locke abandoned it more openly, while still maintaining the idea of [...] "common sensibles" [...] that are perceived. But then George Berkeley abandoned both. David Hume agreed with Berkeley on this, and like Locke and Vico saw himself as following Bacon more than Descartes. In his synthesis, which he saw as the first Baconian analysis of man (something the lesser known Vico had claimed earlier), common sense is entirely built up from shared experience and shared innate emotions, and therefore it is indeed imperfect as a basis for any attempt to know the truth or to make the best decision. But he defended the possibility of science without absolute certainty, and consistently described common sense as giving a valid answer to the challenge of extreme skepticism. Concerning such sceptics, he wrote:But would these prejudiced reasoners reflect a moment, there are many obvious instances and arguments, sufficient to undeceive them, and make them enlarge their maxims and principles. Do they not see the vast variety of inclinations and pursuits among our species; where each man seems fully satisfied with his own course of life, and would esteem it the greatest unhappiness to be confined to that of his neighbour? Do they not feel in themselves, that what pleases at one time, displeases at another, by the change of inclination; and that it is not in their power, by their utmost efforts, to recall that taste or appetite, which formerly bestowed charms on what now appears indifferent or disagreeable?
