40|$|Paul's {{speech on}} the Areopagus {{represents}} the most developed narrative portrayal of Paul's missionary preaching to a gentile audience in the New Testament. As such, it provides indispensable data for interpreting the relationship between Paul's Gospel and the religions of the Roman Empire. This study sets out to interpret the political referents of the Areopagus speech by investigating (1) {{the relationship between the}} Hellenistic Jewish icon parody and deified political authority; (2) the hybrid media of gods and kings; and (3) the art of safe speech in Greco-Roman antiquity. Put another way, this study interprets the Areopagus speech's attitude toward empire by investigating its strategies of resistance along with its objects of resistance. New Testament Scholars have long noted the influence of the Isaianic icon parody upon the composition of Paul's {{speech on the}} Areopagus. The relationship between Paul's idol polemic and the Hellenistic Jewish icon parody, however, remains poorly understood: when the literary culture of early Judaism re-contextualized Isaiah's polemic amid the hybrid iconography of ruler cults, the referent(s) did not remain static or politically innocuous. This study animates the political dimension of the Hellenistic and Roman Jewish icon parodies' allusive objects of resistance through a detailed analysis of the dynamic relationship between gods and kings in the epigraphic record, the peri basileias literature and the system of benefaction underlying visual honors conferred on gods and kings. The integration of gods and kings in shared cult media and anthropomorphic representation placed the Hellenistic and Roman Jewish icon parodies in a new hermeneutical context one that did not critique religion sensu stricto but simultaneously resisted the iconic spectacle underlying the deification of political authority. In order to classify the icon parody as a type of Jewish resistance literature, a correlative concern {{of this study is to}} interpret the Hellenistic- and Roman-Jewish icon parodies within the broader contours of Jewish literary resistance movements that sought to polemically and apologetically defend <b>Jewish</b> conceptions of <b>monotheism,</b> monarchy and representation. In contrast to scholars who appeal to synthetic rhetorical devices to discern so-to-speak "antiimperial rhetoric" in the New Testament, this study suggests that Luke's composition of the Areopagus speech reflects a stronger relationship with the Wisdom of Solomon's polemic against gods and kings (Wis 13 : 1 - 15 : 19) than has heretofore been recognized, along with Greco-Roman orators' conviction that critiquing the ruling power with blunt speech (????????) was both unacceptable and artless, especially in contexts where the speaker's safety was in doubt. The conclusion of this study suggests descriptors for the political attitude of the Areopagus speech and presents Paul's polemic against idols as an alter-cultural rather than antiimperial confrontation with the philosophy of religion. This confrontation has implications for gods, kings and benefactors, whose visual honors are incompatible with the worship of the one God incarnated in Israel's crucified MessiahThesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. tm 2016 New Testament StudiesPhDUnrestricte...|$|R

50|$|It {{has been}} speculated that Hadrian {{intended}} to assimilate the Jewish Temple into the civic-religious basis of support to his reign, {{as he had done}} with Greek and other traditional places of worship. It has also been ventured that Hadrian attempted to unify all belief systems in his empire as a coherent whole that would serve as a basis of support for his autocratic legitimacy - a project that had already been devised earlier by Hellenized Jewish intellectuals such as Philo. The neighbouring Samaritans had already undergone such a process of Hellenisation and religious syncretism, integrating their religious rites with Hellenistic ones. Hadrian probably sanctioned this Hellenised Samaritan worship when, after the suppression of the Jewish revolt, he built a temple to the Hellenistic (and probably syncretic) god Zeus Hypsistos ("Highest") on Mount Gerizim. This attempt at conciliation between Judaism and Hellenism foundered when faced with strict <b>Jewish</b> <b>monotheism.</b> Therefore, the Romans appear to have been surprised by the outbreak of the uprising.|$|E

He is perhaps most well known for his studies on the early emergence of a devotion to Jesus expressed in beliefs about Jesus sharing God's glory, and in a [...] "devotional pattern" [...] in which Jesus features prominently. Hurtado has argued that this Jesus-devotion comprises a novel [...] "mutation" [...] in ancient Jewish monotheistic practice. In his most recent publications, he has also urged greater awareness of the historical value of earliest Christian manuscripts as key physical artifacts of early Christianity, drawing attention to such phenomena as the nomina sacra (distinctive abbreviated forms of certain Greek words, e.g., Theos, Iesous, Kyrios, Christos), the Christian preference for the codex bookform, {{and a number of}} other features.|$|E

The governor of Roman Syria, Publius Petronius, fearing civil war if the order were carried out, delayed implementing it for nearly a year. Agrippa finally convinced Caligula to reverse the order. However, only Caligula's death at the hands of Roman conspirators in 41 CE prevented a full-scale war in Judaea, that might have well spread to the entire Eastern Roman Empire.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} Jews in Greece {{goes back to}} at least the Archaic Era of Greece, when the {{classical}} culture of Greece was undergoing a process of formalization after the Greek Dark Age. The Greek historian Herodotus knew of the Jews, whom he called [...] "Palestinian Syrians", and listed them among the levied naval forces in service of the invading Persians. While <b>Jewish</b> <b>monotheism</b> was not deeply affected by Greek Polytheism, the Greek way of living was attractive for many wealthier Jews. The Synagogue in the Agora of Athens is dated to the period between 267 and 396 CE. The Stobi Synagogue in Macedonia, {{was built on the}} ruins of a more ancient synagogue in the 4th century, while later in the 5th century, the synagogue was transformed into Christian basilica. Hellenistic Judaism thrived in Antioch and Alexandria, many of these Greek-speaking Jews would convert to Christianity.Sporadic epigraphic evidence in grave site excavations, particularly in Brigetio (Szőny), Aquincum (Óbuda), Intercisa (Dunaújváros), Triccinae (Sárvár), Savaria (Szombathely), Sopianae (Pécs) in Hungary, and Osijek in Croatia, attest to the presence of Jews after the 2nd and 3rd centuries where Roman garrisons were established, There was a sufficient number of Jews in Pannonia to form communities and build a synagogue. Jewish troops were among the Syrian soldiers transferred there, and replenished from the Middle East, after 175 C.E. Jews and especially Syrians came from Antioch, Tarsus and Cappadocia. Others came from Italy and the Hellenized parts of the Roman empire. The excavations suggest they first lived in isolated enclaves attached to Roman legion camps and intermarried with other similar oriental families within the military orders of the region. Raphael Patai states that later Roman writers remarked that they differed little in either customs, manner of writing, or names from the people among whom they dwelt; and it was especially difficult to differentiate Jews from the Syrians. After Pannonia was ceded to the Huns in 433, the garrison populations were withdrawn to Italy, and only a few, enigmatic traces remain of a possible Jewish presence in the area some centuries later.|$|E
50|$|Strictly speaking, Jewish {{engagement}} with atheism (i.e. disbelief in God’s existence) can scarcely be found before the modern period, unless one expands the definition to include biblical condemnations of practical atheism (i.e. non-observance), and Jewish attraction to ancient world beliefs {{that might be}} said to have challenged the idea of <b>Jewish</b> <b>monotheism.</b> Of course, there were also debates about the existence of others’ gods (e.g. disbelief in the official gods of the Classical world, or disbelief in the triune God of Christianity), which generated condemnations of Jewish atheism. Likewise, serious Jewish encounters with the Greek sources of philosophical scepticism (i.e. disbelief that a true knowledge of things is attainable by humans) are rare until thinkers like Simone Luzzatto in the early-modern period, although a weaker definition of scepticism (i.e. doubts about authority and suspension of judgment in approaching sources of knowledge, whether secular or sacred) might {{be said to have}} a Jewish legacy {{from the time of the}} first-century philosopher Philo onwards, including tantalizing figures such as Elisha Ben Abuyah in the Talmud, and especially in the form of medieval fideism (i.e. the idea that faith is independent of reason). These shallow intellectual eddies of pre-modern doubt about God’s existence and nature, and about the veracity of human knowledge derived through tradition, became stronger currents with the seventeenth-century philosopher Spinoza, who was regarded by many as atheistic, and with the eighteenth-century Jewish Enlightenment or Haskalah. From that time suspicion of revealed religion began its ascendency and the ties of religion loosened so that less ambiguously sceptical expressions within Jewry began to be heard. However it was the nineteenth-century culture of scientific progress, and the attendant popular interest in ostensibly naturalistic and materialistic writings in the 1870s (especially those of Marx, Nietzsche and Freud in Germany; Spencer, Huxley, and Russell in England; and Ingersoll in the US), that provoked a sea change in popular Jewish thought. Increasingly, the God of revelational religion simply appeared too naïve to countenance. It was from that time that a good number of Jewish thinkers felt obliged to establish oppositional, alternative, synthetic, or complementary models explicitly relating Judaism to the challenges of such atheistic and materialistic philosophies.Significant scholarship on the subject exists - such as the studies of Giuseppe Veltri and David Ruderman in the early-modern period 1 - but that scholarship tends to be localized and fragmented in nature and we still await a general survey of these related topic.2----1 Among Ruderman’s most important contributions is David Ruderman, Jewish Thought and Scientific Discovery in Early Modern Europe (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1995). Veltri currently directs a research programme on Jewish Scepticism at the University of Hamburg and among his most relevant publications is Giuseppe Veltri, “Principles of Jewish Skeptical Thought.
