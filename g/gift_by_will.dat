50|$|In {{the reign}} of Elizabeth the Fraudulent Conveyances Act 1571 and 1584 avoided {{fraudulent}} conveyances as against all parties and voluntary conveyances as against subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration. Early in {{the reign of}} Charles II the Tenures Abolition Act 1660 turned most feudal tenures into tenure by {{free and common socage}} and abolished the feudal incidents. The Statute of Frauds contained provisions that certain leases and assignments, and that all agreements and trusts relating to land, should be in writing. The land registries of Middlesex and Yorkshire date from the reign of Anne. Devises (<b>gifts</b> <b>by</b> <b>will)</b> of land for charitable purposes were forbidden by the Charitable Uses Act of 1735. In the next reign the first general Inclosure Act, the Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801, was passed. In the reign of William IV fines and recoveries were abolished and simpler modes of conveyance substituted, and the laws of inheritance and dower were amended.|$|R
50|$|The most {{usual way}} of {{acquiring}} {{an interest in}} property is {{as the result of}} a consensual transaction with the previous owner, for example, a sale or a <b>gift.</b> Dispositions <b>by</b> <b>will</b> may also be regarded as consensual transactions, since the effect of a will is to provide for the distribution of the deceased person's property to nominated beneficiaries. A person may also obtain an interest in property under a trust established for his or her benefit by the owner of the property.|$|R

She made a <b>gift</b> <b>by</b> her <b>will</b> to the University of Sydney of a silver tea and coffee service which had {{previously}} been presented to her husband, Henry Ebenezer Barff, after he completed 25 years of service at the University of Sydney. She stated in her will that she hoped 'the service may {{be used by the}} Chancellor and Vice Chancellor when entertaining distinguished visitors to the University'. However, she left her estate of £8000 and numerous possessions to her daughter.|$|R
40|$|The {{landscape}} of charitable giving in Canada has been altered {{over the past}} decade by tax incentives favoring large gifts of capital. Next steps could include tax credits for donations of real estate assets and private company shares. This policy reform promises to increase charitable giving, broaden the donation base and make charities less vulnerable to market swings. These credits can be introduced {{in a manner consistent with}} existing laws that reduces the chance of tax system abuse. 1 Contribution limits increased from 20 percent to 75 percent of income per annum and 100 percent at death. 2 Statistics Canada does not break out giving data by type of asset or timing (i. e., <b>gifts</b> <b>by</b> <b>will</b> or life insurance). The absence of detailed tax data makes it difficult to state definitively the relative importance of capital tax incentives on giving. The sharp rise in giving is coincident with introduction of tax incentives. Wages and income grew by 87. 5 percent from 1995 to 2007 versus 140 percent for donations. [CANSIM Table 380 - 0016]. In the two decades prior to 1996, giving tracked wages. Other factors affecting giving may include capital market growth, real estate values, lower tax rates, changing philanthropic attitudes, more fundraising, and increased concentration of wealth. Since 1996, successive federal governments in Canada have introduced more than 20 tax incentives t...|$|R

50|$|The {{effect of}} Christianity upon the will was very marked. For instance, {{the duty of}} bequeathing to the Church was inculcated as early as Constantine, and heretics and monks were placed under a {{disability}} to make a will or take <b>gifts</b> left <b>by</b> <b>will.</b> A will was often deposited in a church. The Canon law follows the Roman law with a still greater leaning {{to the advantage of}} the Church. No Church property could be bequeathed. Manifest usurers were added to the list of those under disability. For the validity of a will it was generally necessary that it should be made {{in the presence of a}} priest and two witnesses, unless where it was made in pias causes. The witnesses, as in Roman law, must be done. Gifts to the Church were not subject to the deductions in favour of the heir and the children necessary in ordinary cases. In England, the Church succeeded in holding in its own hands for centuries jurisdiction in testamentary matters.|$|R
50|$|Although the United States is for {{the most}} part a common law {{jurisdiction}} recognizing life estate instead of usufruct, Louisiana is a civil-law jurisdiction, specifically following the French and Spanish models. In Louisiana, usufructs generally are created {{in a manner similar to}} other real rights, <b>by</b> <b>gift</b> ("donation"), <b>will</b> ("testament"), or operation of law. Nevertheless, they are typically granted cestui que vie. Unless otherwise provided in a will, a person's share of community property accedes to descendants as bare title holders ("naked owners"); nevertheless, if that person has a living spouse, the latter will receive a usufruct in that portion of the estate until death or remarriage (La. Civil Code art. 890). Under certain other conditions, a usufruct may arise giving rights to that person's parents.|$|R
5000|$|Under ecclesiastical law, {{common law}} and equity, various {{customary}} rules had long existed for disposing of personal property <b>by</b> <b>will.</b> However, {{the power to}} <b>gift</b> real property <b>by</b> <b>will</b> had been first granted by the Statute of Wills (1540). Various rules grew up around the formalities necessary to create a valid will and the Statute of Frauds (1677) created the requirement that a will of real property must be in writing. By the early nineteenth century, the rules had become complex, with different rules for formalising wills of real and personal property. The 4th report of the Commissioners for Inquiring into the Law of Real Property recommended a simplified and unified scheme. As the Commissioners observed [...] "Any scrap of paper, or memorandum in ink or in pencil, mentioning an intended disposition of his property, is admitted as a will and will be valid, although written by another person, and not read over to the testator, or even seen by him, if proved {{to be made in}} his lifetime according to his instructions." [...] A bill was introduced by the Attorney General Sir John Campbell, one of the Commissioners, in 1834 though it was much delayed for want of parliamentary time. The bill was introduced in the House of Lords by Lord Langdale.|$|R
