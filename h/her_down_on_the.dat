2500|$|A Z Nation episode has a {{character}} flying a small airplane {{that needs to}} land near a city with no nearby airport, and so declares, [...] "I'm gonna set <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> river, Sully Sullenberger Style".|$|E
60|$|They {{shook the}} flour off her and set <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> kitchen floor. She {{seemed to be}} in a terrible fright.|$|E
60|$|He {{then put}} <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Queen's lap, where she, purring, played with her Majesty's hand, and then sang herself to sleep.|$|E
60|$|Sydney laid <b>her</b> <b>down</b> again <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillow, {{gave her}} a last kiss, {{and ran out of}} the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you, uncle;" [...] and, {{instead of looking}} up into his face, she turned <b>her</b> eyes <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> green lawn beneath her feet.|$|R
6000|$|RAINA. Tell me, tell me. How was it! (Ecstatically) Oh, mother, mother, mother! (Raina pulls <b>her</b> mother <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ottoman; {{and they}} kiss one another frantically.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell {{me about}} it!" [...] Miss Milray pulled <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa with her, and {{modified}} her embrace to a clasp of Clementina's bands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fire rises out of {{the lunar}} mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her up to a peak, and lay <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of a crater." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [TABBY, {{tambourine}} in {{one hand}} and apple in the other, smiles [...] stolidly. He sets <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ladder, and stands, holding [...] her level With him.] ...|$|E
60|$|As Arthur {{looked at}} her inquiringly, with a new {{apprehension}} on him, she withdrew her hand, and laid <b>her</b> face <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot where it had rested.|$|R
6000|$|... "It'll be sixpence, at least, Sally," [...] said Mary, {{bringing}} <b>her</b> fist <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table. [...] "And we're all sick {{to death}} of women and their votes." ...|$|R
6000|$|She put <b>her</b> {{forehead}} <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of <b>her</b> {{hand and}} laughed again. [...] "You {{ought to be}} photographed. You look {{as if you were}} sitting for it." ...|$|R
60|$|Jim {{yelled at}} her--threw <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seat. She felt {{the body of}} the guard sink against her knees. Then she seemed to feel, to hear through an icy, sickening terror.|$|E
60|$|Very gently Rachel laid <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed. Eliza slept {{as she had}} not slept {{since the}} dreadful night when she had taken her boy and run away through the cold, dark night.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hardly think so," [...] {{said the}} Principal One. [...] "She {{may not be}} used to that sort of thing, and she might take cold. It will be best just to lay <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bank and wash her there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{child is}} very {{young to be}} sent alone," [...] said she, putting <b>her</b> candle <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table. She {{considered}} me attentively {{for a minute or}} two, then further added-- ...|$|R
60|$|At first each wave {{had lifted}} {{the ship and}} let <b>her</b> crash <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sands, but as the tide fell this action decreased, and had ceased entirely when the {{lifeboat}} arrived.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much," [...] replied Miss Elsie, setting {{her small}} lips together. [...] "It's Mr. Custer. He's talking {{business}} with <b>her</b> now <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach. They'll {{be here when}} lunch is ready." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what I'd do," [...] said Dick. [...] "I'd marry some milk-maid and keep <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> property. I'd {{see that it was}} all done legally, and I'd take the kid away when he was three or four years old." ...|$|E
60|$|Here Foulata, who {{had been}} in a state of great fear and {{agitation}} throughout, said that she felt faint and could go no farther, but would wait there. Accordingly we set <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> unfinished wall, placing the basket of provisions by her side, and left her to recover.|$|E
60|$|The Aquila {{was still}} alongside, and the mateâ€™s heart thumped violently {{as he saw}} the cause of all the trouble sitting alone on the deck. She rose with a little start as her mother stepped {{carefully}} aboard, and, running to her, kissed her affectionately, and sat <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hatches.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{the gods}} we are {{together}} again!" [...] Mysa said as Chebron, after embracing <b>her,</b> sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cushion beside <b>her.</b> [...] "I feel almost happy now, {{in spite of}} the dreadful times that have passed." ...|$|R
60|$|There was no answer. He {{lifted her}} in his arms and {{staggered}} into the house with his burden, his heart stilling with a horrible fear as he laid <b>her</b> gently <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> old lounge {{in one corner of the}} kitchen.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I thought, oh! long ago, that I {{would marry}} him myself. But {{you knew him}} first [...] . And he only saved me [...] . But you saved him!' [...] . And then she laid <b>her</b> head <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{throbbing}} bosom, and sobbed [...] .|$|R
60|$|The {{next wave}} lifted the Gleam like a cork, and let <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rocks like fifty-six tons of lead. A flash of {{lightning}} revealed for a moment a range of frowning cliffs, as if to add horror to a scene that was already sufficiently appalling. Then all was again dark as Erebus.|$|E
6000|$|... "There!" [...] and Eustace giggled {{again and}} ordered her away; but I saw Harold's brow knit with pain, {{and as she}} began to {{reiterate}} her assertion and resist Eustace, he gently sat <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chair near at hand, and silently made her understand that she was to stay there; but Eustace rather teasingly said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear child,' said Albinia, affectionately {{putting her}} arm round her waist, and drawing <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seat beside her, 'indeed I am not displeased with you; {{you are doing}} the very best thing {{possible}} by us all. Think I am your sister, {{and tell me what}} is the meaning of all this, and then I will try to help you.' ...|$|E
60|$|Willems said nothing. He {{stood before}} <b>her</b> looking <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and repeating to himself: I must get that {{revolver}} away from her, at once, at once. I can't think of trusting myself with those men without firearms. I must have it.|$|R
60|$|Then, as the {{darkness}} closed in, the daughter laid <b>her</b> head <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hard ground close at the father's side, and watched him. The darkness deepened and deepened, {{and they both}} lay quiet, until a light gleamed through the chinks in the wall.|$|R
60|$|Then he laid <b>her</b> head <b>down</b> again <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillow and, {{kneeling}} beside her, {{held her}} hand in his.|$|R
60|$|I put <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, {{and there}} Tim began rowing with her. I do wish Tim would mind his own business. It was no concern of his {{what she had}} been doing. Besides, he is not a saint himself. He is only a two-year-old fox-terrier, and he interferes with {{everything}} and gives himself the airs of a gray-headed Scotch collie.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed an}} unthinkably long way, and his burden so heavy {{he felt he}} would never get to the house. But at last {{he was in the}} stable-yard, and then in the house-yard. He opened the door and went into the house. In the kitchen he laid <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hearthrug, and called. The house was empty. But the fire was burning in the grate.|$|E
60|$|When all was done, {{and not a}} {{speck of}} dirt was to be seen {{anywhere}} on little Bridget, the fairies took her gently up and carried her to her mother's house, for they knew very well where she lived. There they laid <b>her</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> doorstep, where it was both warm and shady, and they all scampered away as fast as their funny little legs could carry them.|$|E
60|$|One evening, when Mr. Mohun and Claude were dining out, Lilias {{was left}} alone with Mr. and Mrs. Hawkesworth. Lily was very tired, but she worked {{steadily}} at marking Eleanor's pocket-handkerchiefs, until her sister, seeing how weary she was, made <b>her</b> lie <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Agrees with Phyllis! She looks pounds---nay, hundred-weights {{better than}} when we left home. I mean to have <b>her</b> <b>down</b> to-morrow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach for a lark---castle-building, paddling---with Mysie and Val, and Fergus and all. That's what would set her up best, wouldn't it, Jane?' ...|$|R
60|$|She put <b>down</b> <b>her</b> book <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{sofa and}} got up, {{not without a}} little tremor at this {{unexpected}} encounter.|$|R
