40|$|Abstract. MAN Diesel’s 6 S 50 MC-C disel is a {{two-stroke}} {{marine diesel}} engine. Preload of the exhaust valve component is applied in four bolts. The preload of bolts {{can improve the}} fatigue strength of the exhaust component. In addition, the bolt pretension ensure the sealing in the maximum firing pressure. Using of simulation method, the displacement and deformation of exhaust valve component are analyzed when the maximum firing pressure and preload are applied. By analysis of the deformation of the exhaust valve housing under different preload force, the deformation of exhaust valve housing increase with the increaseing of preload. The maximum total deformation is 0. 40 mm in the preload of 720 KN. The maximum deformation occurs in the region near the bolt {{in the side of}} exhaust gas outlet. The deformation in the direction of Y-axis of exhaust valve housing is along the Y-axis opposite direction when the preload is greater than 540 KN. This indicates that the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> <b>seal</b> well. The sealing and deformation of the exhaust valve component meets the desgin requirement...|$|E
40|$|Detailed exhaust {{emission}} data {{have been taken}} from a Cummins N- 14 single cylinder research engine in which the oil consumption was varied by different engine modifications. Low sulfur fuel was used, and oil consumption was varied by modifying the intake <b>valve</b> stem <b>seals,</b> the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> stem <b>seals,</b> the oil control ring and combinations of these modifications. Detailed measurements of exhaust gas particle size distributions and chemical composition were made for the various oil consumption configurations {{for a range of}} engine loads and speeds. The particulate mass was measured with TEOM and traditional gravimetric filter methods. Filter data for EC/OC, sulfates and trace metals have been taken and analyzed. The trace metals in the particulate mass {{serve as the basis for}} assessing oil consumption at the different operating conditions. The data indicate that the oil consumption for the steady state testing done here was approximately an order of magnitude below oil consumption values cited in the literature. We did measure changes in the details of the chemical composition of the particulate for the different engine operating conditions, but it did not correlate with changes in the oil consumption. Furthermore, the data indicate that the particle size distribution is not strongly impacted by low level oil consumption variations observed in this work...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{hot gases}} {{produced}} by the internal combustion engines passes through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and causes high temperatures in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat. To avoid damaging the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> heat must be transferred from the valve to its seat during the contact they make at the opening and closing cycle. Heat transfer rate from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> to its seat {{is a function of}} many factors. One of the most important factors is the thermal contact conductance (TCC) between the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat. Very few researches have been done about estimation of the TCC between the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat in the past. An experimental study has been conducted to determine the TCC between two co-axial cylinders, as the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat.

40|$|Abstract — The system aims at {{modifying the}} {{position}} and diameter of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> {{in order to reduce}} the probability of knocking (both in SI and in CI) and lessen the dilution of charge because of the small size of <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> when compared to the size of inlet valve. The size of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is smaller when compared to the size of inlet valve. It is done so because the region closer to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is at a higher temperature compared to that of the temperature surrounding the inlet valve. Now if the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> size is increased there will be higher possibility of knocking because the charge coming inside the combustion chamber has a higher probability of combusting at <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve’s</b> surface (due to large surface area). On the other hand if the size is too small then, there will be greater possibility of dilution in the intake charge because there is no enough space for the burnt gas to leave the chamber. To reduce these problems, modifications in the engine is proposed. In general inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> are positioned vertically along the axis of the combustion chamber. Now if the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is placed along the horizontal axis (i. e. perpendicular to the cylinder axis) and if the size of the valve is increased then there will be less possibility for the dilution. But the probability of knocking increases. Since the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is placed along the horizontal axis, the outer surface of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> will be in contact with the water cooling system of the combustion chamber (outside the chamber). Thus this cooling system or the coolant will be able to release the heat at the outer surface of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and transfer heat from the seat surface of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> (commonly in tappet valves). The rate of Heat Transfer will be high because the surface area perpendicular to heat flow direction is large thereby enhancing heat transfer. The possibility of the dilution is reduced because, during the piston movement from BDC (Bottom Dead Center) to the TDC (Top Dead Center) the piston pushes the burnt gases outside through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> since the size of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is increased, it is easie...|$|R
50|$|Early/late <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> closingEarly {{and late}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> closing can also reduce emissions. Traditionally, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> opens, and <b>exhaust</b> gas is {{pushed out of}} the {{cylinder}} and into the exhaust manifold by the piston as it travels upward. By manipulating {{the timing of the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> engineers can control how much exhaust gas is left in the cylinder. By holding the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> open slightly longer, the cylinder is emptied more and ready to be filled with a bigger air/fuel charge on the intake stroke. By closing the valve slightly early, more exhaust gas remains in the cylinder which increases fuel efficiency. This allows for more efficient operation under all conditions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{manufacturing}} {{process of the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> in large marine diesel engines consists of an upset forging and final forming process. In the past, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> in large marine diesel engines have been made through free forging by using the stretch forming method. This method has used the ingot and the billet as a preliminary forming process. Nimonic 80 A, a superalloy, is presently used for the material of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve.</b> For the forming method of the valve, the electric upset method is used. Solid bar is raised up to the forming temperature by using electric energy and is continually deformed by upset pressure. The electric upsetting processing is a useful method for the high quality of <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> in large marine diesel engines. It can keep the continuous grain flow, excellent mechanical property, and corrosion resistance because of the elaborate macrostructure of the valve face.
