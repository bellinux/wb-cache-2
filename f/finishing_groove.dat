30|$|Similarly, {{repair rate}} {{fluctuations}} {{have been studied}} for the effect of maintenance on time-dependent availability of the system. We found that the time-dependent availability of system S 1 shows 0.001 % increase for fixture seat machining and rough pin hole boring, and for other subsystems, time-dependent availability shows 0.01 % (for rough grooving cum tuning and finish profile turning), 0.02 % (for rough oil drilling), and 0.025 % increase (for <b>finish</b> <b>grooving)</b> with corresponding increase in repair rates as observed from Tables  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So the weak subsystem {{was found to be}} the fixture seat machining which is due to the effect maintenance practice as well.|$|R
50|$|A groove may be through, {{meaning that}} it passes {{all the way through}} the surface and its ends are open, or stopped, meaning that one or both of the ends <b>finish</b> before the <b>groove</b> meets edge of the surface.|$|R
25|$|All three entrances use heavy opaque modern metal doors. On the inside, the {{sanctuary}} has curved rows of wooden pews on a hardwood floor divided by a central aisle that offer seating for 350. Laminated wooden buttresses flank all the windows; in between {{them are the}} painted Stations of the Cross. Every third buttress is heavier and thicker. The walls are finished in shiplap below the windowsill level; above that a chair rail sets off a <b>finish</b> of <b>grooved</b> rectangles similar to those on the exterior.|$|R
50|$|Jules O'Dwyer and her dog Matisse won the {{competition}}. Magician Jamie Raven came {{second with}} Welsh choir Côr Glanaethwy in third, and dance act Old Men <b>Grooving</b> <b>finishing</b> fourth place. The result marked {{the second time}} that a dog act had won the whole competition (following Ashleigh & Pudsey in 2012).|$|R
50|$|In 2008, the Mercury started {{slowly and}} never really found a <b>groove,</b> <b>finishing</b> {{the season with}} a disappointing record of 16-18, well out of the playoff picture in a tough Western Conference. The Mercury became the first team in WNBA history with the dubious honor of failing to qualify for the playoffs after winning the WNBA Finals the year before.|$|R

Behind the altar is a round-arched alcove faced in shiplap below the springline; above it uses the same block motif as the interior and exterior walls. Two small statues of Christ sit on pedestals fronting either side. On {{the back of the}} alcove is a crucifix with a sunburst pattern above.|$|R
40|$|Standard flanges {{for five}} widely differing {{pressure}} ratings, having {{a wide range}} of different joint surface profiles, were sealed by flat rubber or asbestos gaskets. Different initial bolt tensions were applied and the variation of clamping force with internal pressure was measured up to leakage of the joint. The joint efficiency, defined as: (end thrust due to leakage pressure on bore area of pipe) /(total initial bolting force), is not affected by variations in joint-face surface <b>finish</b> if machining <b>grooves</b> across the joint surface are avoided. Minimum values of joint efficiency are given. The effects of gasket material, width and thickness and number of bolts on joint efficiency are considered. ...|$|R
50|$|In June 1989, In the <b>Groove</b> <b>{{finished}}</b> {{second in}} a maiden race at Newbury Racecourse and then finished second again when odds-on favourite for a similar event at Windsor three weeks later. In August she was sent to York for the Moorestyle Convivial Maiden Stakes over six furlongs. She took the lead {{a quarter of a}} mile from the finish and drew clear of her opponents to win easily by six lengths. In the Groove was moved up in class for her final appearance as a two-year-old, when she was sent to Ireland to contest the Group Three Park Stakes at Phoenix Park Racecourse in October. She started favourite, but finished third behind the Vincent O'Brien-trained Wedding Bouquet.|$|R
50|$|A {{month later}} Salsabil was moved up in {{distance}} {{for the one}} and a half mile Epsom Oaks and started 2/1 favourite, just ahead of the Irish 1000 Guineas winner In the Groove. Racing on softer ground than at Newmarket, Salsabil was restrained by Carson in the early stages before moving up {{to take the lead in}} the straight. She pulled clear of the field to win by five lengths from Game Plan, with Knight's Baroness in third and In the <b>Groove</b> <b>finishing</b> fourth. After the Oaks, Salsabil's connections took the unusual step of sending her to contest the Irish Derby against colts. Few fillies had contested the race, and none had been successful since Gallinaria in 1900. The field included Quest for Fame and Blue Stag, first and second in the Epsom Derby and Sheikh Mohammed's highly rated Belmez. Salsabil took the lead in the straight and won by three quarters of a length from the outsider Deploy, with a gap of four lengths back to Belmez, who narrowly beat Blue Stag and Quest for Fame for third.|$|R
40|$|FIB {{technology}} showed {{great potential}} in the fabrication of complex shapes in precision microtools made of CVD polycrystalline diamond. This is a hardwearing tool material but otherwise difficult to be ground and shaped into precision cutting tools. A sinusoidal shape was successfully produced and replicated onto aluminium substrates via a “plunging” single point diamond turning process. The incubation of the aluminium samples confirm that microstructured surfaces {{have the potential to}} act as directors for the formation of biofilms of Bacillus sp. on metal surfaces. In particular: - Microstructured surfaces show a preferential cell adhesion compared to planar surfaces with optical <b>finish</b> - Sinusoidal <b>grooves</b> show higher potential than trapezoidal grooves for cells attachment and biofilm growth - The Sdr parameter is a good indicator for the available surface area, thus quantifying the potential for bacterial adhesion Further work is currently ongoing to investigate the role of the material composition and mechanical properties (stiffness) in the biofilm formation in conjunction with the quantification of biofilm formed on different microstructured surfaces...|$|R
40|$|In 1988, a 1067 m long {{touchdown}} zone on {{each end}} of the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) was modified from its original heavy-broom <b>finish</b> with transverse <b>grooves</b> configuration to a longitudinal corduroy surface texture with no transverse grooves. The intent of this modification was to reduce the spin-up wear on the Orbiter main gear tires and provide for somewhat higher crosswind capabilities at that site. The modification worked well, so it was proposed that the remainder of the runway be modified as well to permit even higher crosswind landing capability. Tests were conducted at the NASA Langley Aircraft Landing Dynamics Facility (ALDF) to evaluate the merit of such a modification. This paper discusses the results of these tests, and explains why the proposed modification did not provide the expected improvement and thus was not implemented. Also, in an ongoing program to evaluate the origin of various tire wear phenomenon, a series of tests was conducted to evaluate the effect of braking on tire wear. Finally, a modified tire is discussed in terms of its wear performance under rollout and braking operations...|$|R
50|$|Internally {{the house}} has a central hall, with rooms leading off on either side. At the front are two rooms now {{converted}} to offices. Each room has vertically jointed walls and tongue and groove ceilings, French doors leading onto the front (northern) side and a double hung window on the other external side. The room on the east has access to a small modern en-suite bathroom. The room on the right has a fireplace with timber surrounds and shelf. The next door {{on the left is}} another modern bathroom with pine ceiling and a dividing wall with leadlight through to the en suite bathroom. The hall enters a larger back room on the right with vertically jointed walls and ceiling, {{the second half of the}} double fireplace, a double hung window onto the west and French doors onto the verandah at the south. The remaining quarter of the floor is occupied by a kitchen that opens into the enclosed sections of the verandah. All the fittings are modern, including the sloping clear sealed pine tongue and groove ceiling on the verandah portion and the three double hung windows in the new section. Early double hung windows and French doors open onto the verandah, presumably from the original room. Narrow stairs lead to the attic which consists of two rooms. These are carpeted and lined with vertically jointed timber boards except on two walls which have horizontal beaded boards. The ceilings are recent with clear <b>finished</b> tongue and <b>groove</b> boards. The eastern room has two double hung sash windows with timber framed hoods. The western room has the chimney through it and leads onto a balcony with timber railings and cross balustrading. There is a recent door into the roof space at the front of the building.|$|R
