25|$|Avogadro, Crepaldi and {{coworkers}} described six moderately obese patients with diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and marked <b>hypertriglyceridemia,</b> {{all of which}} improved when the patients were put on a hypocaloric, low-carbohydrate diet.|$|E

25|$|Rosuvastatin is {{approved}} in the United States {{for the treatment}} of high LDL cholesterol (dyslipidemia), total cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia), and/or triglycerides (<b>hypertriglyceridemia).</b> In February 2010, rosuvastatin was approved by the FDA for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} adverse {{reactions}} (≥30% occurrence, {{leading to a}} 5% treatment discontinuation rate) observed with sirolimus in clinical studies of organ rejection prophylaxis in individuals with kidney transplants include: peripheral edema, hypercholesterolemia, abdominal pain, headache, nausea, diarrhea, pain, constipation, <b>hypertriglyceridemia,</b> hypertension, increased creatinine, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, arthralgia, and thrombocytopenia.|$|E
25|$|Drinking in {{moderation}} {{has been found}} to help those who have suffered a heart attack survive it. However, excessive alcohol consumption leads to an increased risk of heart failure. A review of the literature found that half a drink of alcohol offered the best level of protection. However, they noted that at present there have been no randomised trials to confirm the evidence which suggests a protective role of low doses of alcohol against heart attacks. However, moderate alcohol consumption is associated with hypertension. There is an increased risk of <b>hypertriglyceridemia,</b> cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and stroke if 3 or more standard drinks of alcohol are taken per day.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977 and 1978, Gerald B. Phillips {{developed}} {{the concept that}} risk factors for myocardial infarction concur to form a [...] "constellation of abnormalities" [...] (i.e., glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, hypercholesterolemia, <b>hypertriglyceridemia,</b> and hypertension) associated not only with heart disease, but also with aging, obesity and other clinical states. He suggested {{there must be an}} underlying linking factor, the identification of which could lead to the prevention of cardiovascular disease; he hypothesized that this factor was sex hormones.|$|E
2500|$|Non-alcoholic {{liver disease}} occurs {{in people with}} little or no history of alcohol use, and is instead {{strongly}} associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes, and <b>hypertriglyceridemia.</b> Over time, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, which additionally involves liver cell death, liver inflammation and possible fibrosis. Factors accelerating progression from NAFLD to NASH are obesity, older age, non-African American ethnicity, female gender, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, higher ALT or AST level, higher AST/ALT ratio, low platelet count, and an [...]|$|E
50|$|Weight {{loss and}} dietary {{modification}} may {{be effective in}} <b>hypertriglyceridemia.</b> The decision to treat <b>hypertriglyceridemia</b> with medication depends on the levels and {{on the presence of}} other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Very high levels that would increase the risk of pancreatitis is treated with a drug from the fibrate class. Niacin and omega-3 fatty acids as well as drugs from the statin class may be used in conjunction, with statins being the main drug treatment for moderate <b>hypertriglyceridemia</b> where reduction of cardiovascular risk is required.|$|E
50|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} {{occurs in}} people whose triglyceride levels are above 1000 mg/dl (11.3 mmol/l). <b>Hypertriglyceridemia</b> {{is associated with}} 1-4% of all cases of pancreatitis. The symptoms are similar to pancreatitis secondary to other causes, although the presence of xanthomas or risk factors for <b>hypertriglyceridemia</b> may offer clues.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hypertriglyceridemia</b> denotes high (hyper-) {{blood levels}} (-emia) of triglycerides, the most {{abundant}} fatty molecule in most organisms. Elevated levels of triglycerides are associated with atherosclerosis, {{even in the absence}} of hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol levels), and predispose to cardiovascular disease. Very high triglyceride levels also increase the risk of acute pancreatitis. <b>Hypertriglyceridemia</b> itself is usually symptomless, although high levels may be associated with skin lesions known as xanthomas.|$|E
5000|$|Familial LPL {{deficiency}} {{should be}} considered in anyone with severe <b>hypertriglyceridemia</b> and the chylomicronemia syndrome. The absence of secondary causes of severe <b>hypertriglyceridemia</b> (like e.g. diabetes, alcohol, estrogen-, glucocorticoid-, antidepressant- or isotretinoin-therapy, certain antihypertensive agents, and paraproteinemic disorders) increases the possibility of LPL deficiency. In this instance besides LPL also other loss-of-function mutations in genes that regulate catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (like e.g. ApoC2, ApoA5, LMF-1, GPIHBP-1 and GPD1) should also be considered ...|$|E
