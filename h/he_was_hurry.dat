60|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>hurrying</b> {{out when}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> confronted {{in the doorway}} by Captain Shotover.|$|R
60|$|Draconmeyer {{arrested the}} much {{impressed}} maître d'hôtel as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> away.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile, {{instead of}} waiting, why not hunt up Cheseldine in his {{mountain}} retreat? The thought no sooner struck Duane than <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> for his horse.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miles Nanson {{saw the man}} {{running from}} the house. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> to get a doctor for his wife, who was very sick, and he didn't stop to {{question}} the fellow." ...|$|R
60|$|A wail was his reply, {{and with}} that wail ringing in his ears to assure him {{that he did not}} pass unloved, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurried</b> below to prepare him for his end.|$|R
5|$|Edrich eschewed attacking strokeplay {{as he and}} Denis Compton {{attempted}} to establish themselves. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurried</b> by the pace of Lindwall and Johnston, making many last-moment movements to either hit the ball or withdraw from a shot.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My child, mine own, I am take thee!--Oh, do not {{struggle}} with me!' he cried, himself imploring now. 'Child, one kiss for thy father;' and meantime, putting absolute force on his vehement affection, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> to the chancel.|$|R
60|$|So saying, Turkey rose to {{his feet}} and threw his arms into a pugilistic position. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> away to make good his promise, when I {{detained}} him, alarmed at the effect of incautiously rousing Turkey's combativeness after dinner.|$|R
50|$|In 316, the {{governor}} of Cappadocia and Lesser Armenia Agricolaus began a persecution by order of the Emperor Licinius and Saint Blaise was seized. After his interrogation and a severe scourging, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurried</b> off to prison, and subsequently beheaded.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think {{anything}} about it at all. When Mr. Scruby hurries down the room in that way he looks as the man looked when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> under the lamp-post. I am not disposed to say any more at present." ...|$|R
6000|$|And so saying, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> away, before Fanny, {{overpowered}} by {{a thousand}} feelings {{of pain and}} pleasure, could attempt to speak; but quickened by one sovereign wish, she then called out, [...] "Oh! cousin, stop a moment, pray stop!" ...|$|R
60|$|After this <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurried</b> to the freight-house, {{where he}} saw the yard-master, a smallish, white-faced man in shirt, trousers, and slippers, looking down upon a sea of trucks, a mob of bawling truckmen, and squadrons of backing, turning, sweating, spark-striking horses.|$|R
60|$|To this Felix readily assented. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurried</b> and harassed {{nearly to}} the extent of his time and capacity; he could not pause to give full {{consideration}} to his young brother's project, and was glad that the ungracious task of silencing it should be imposed on one less immediately interested.|$|R
60|$|So {{across the}} Green Meadows {{and up the}} Lone Little Path hurried Peter Rabbit, so as to reach the Laughing Brook before jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had wholly turned out his light, after going to bed behind the Purple Hills. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> so that <b>he</b> almost ran into Unc' Billy Possum.|$|R
60|$|Although Tarzan {{was called}} early the {{following}} morning, {{the company of}} SPAHIS was on the march before he had finished his breakfast. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> through his meal that the soldiers might not get too far in advance of him when he glanced through the door connecting the dining room with the bar.|$|R
60|$|Unc' Billy Possum stopped short. <b>He</b> had <b>been</b> <b>hurrying</b> so {{fast that}} he hadn't seen Jimmy Skunk at all.|$|R
60|$|Some {{few days}} later, {{owing to the}} fact that the latter, being preoccupied, did not see him first, Bruce Carmyle met his cousin Lancelot in Piccadilly. They had {{returned}} by different routes from Roville, and Ginger would have preferred the separation to continue. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> on with a nod, when Carmyle stopped him.|$|R
60|$|Immediately {{the trees}} hid him, and {{presently}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> thrusting through them and in sight again. She could see {{there was something}} different, and then she saw that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> unusually and then that he limped. He gestured to her, and she walked towards him. His face became clearer, and she saw with infinite concern that he winced at every stride.|$|R
60|$|Fresh surprises were {{in store}} for him, however. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> along when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{overtaken}} by two students. These youths, instead of raising their caps or showing any other sign of respect, gave a wild whoop of delight the instant that they saw him, and rushing at him, seized him by each arm and commenced dragging him along with them.|$|R
6000|$|Ebbo flew up the stairs, {{and shouted}} for his brother; then, coming down, gave {{orders for the}} men {{to go out on}} the mountain-side, and search and jodel. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> with them, but his mother caught his arm. [...] "O Ebbo, how can I let you go? It is dark, and the crags are so perilous!" ...|$|R
60|$|For reply, he {{received}} a vicious jerk on his arm. It {{reminded him of his}} childhood when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurried</b> along by some angry grown-up. And like a child, <b>he</b> had to <b>be</b> helped up the car step. He sank down on an outside seat, panting, sweating, overcome by the exertion. He followed George's eyes as the latter looked him up and down.|$|R
6000|$|But Mrs. Sepulvida ran to {{the deep}} embrasured window and peeped out. [...] "It isn't the lawyer, for <b>he</b> <b>is</b> driving away in his buggy, as if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>hurrying</b> {{to get out of}} the fog, and my gentleman still remains. Dolores!" [...] said Mrs. Sepulvida, {{suddenly}} facing her friend with an expression of mock gravity and humour, [...] "this won't do! Who is that cavalier?" ...|$|R
60|$|Bobby Coon {{had thought}} {{of a plan to}} turn the joke on Unc' Billy Possum, and this <b>was</b> why <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> back and forth {{whispering}} in the ears of every one who lived on the Green Meadows and in the Green Forest; that is everybody excepting Unc' Billy Possum and his family. It was the busiest day that Bobby Coon could remember.|$|R
60|$|Shortly {{before the}} time set for the nuptials another {{disaster}} occurred. There was but one man scalped by the Owens River Indians last year. That man was Williamson Breckinridge Caruthers of New Jersey. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> home with happiness in his heart, when he lost his hair forever, and in that hour of bitterness he almost cursed the mistaken mercy that had spared his head.|$|R
60|$|Up to {{that point}} the unhappy youth had entertained no {{definite}} idea as to why <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> towards the hut of Paul Bevan, or what he meant to say for himself on reaching it. But towards noon, as he drew near to it, the thought of Betty in her innocence and purity oppressed him. She rose before his mind's eye like a reproving angel.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> {{at the top}} of the steps. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurried</b> {{across a}} narrow railed footway, and {{suddenly}} with a vast shouting the amphitheatre of ruins opened again before him. [...] "The Master is with us! The Master! The Master!" [...] The shout swept athwart the lake of faces like a wave, broke against the distant cliff of ruins, and came back in a welter of cries. [...] "The Master is on our side!" ...|$|R
60|$|At last, as ten <b>was</b> striking, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurried</b> away. Frey Miguel {{had gone}} on his knees to him, and kissed his hand, what time he had passionately urged him not to linger; and then Sebastian {{had done the same}} by the Princess both weeping now. At last <b>he</b> <b>was</b> gone, and on the arm of Dona Maria de Grado the forlorn Anne {{staggered}} back to her cell to weep and pray.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1922, the Waterhouses moved to Knoxville, Tennessee to be near both of their sons. Bishop Waterhouse had grown rather feeble, but kept up his effort to recover, taking regular exercises. On 7 December 1922, while thus engaged, {{walking on a street}} on a gloomy afternoon, Bishop Waterhouse was struck by an {{automobile}} and fatally injured. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurried</b> to a hospital, but did not regain consciousness.|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} time the small party, which we before mentioned, bore the bier of the ill-fated Hamish to his humble grave, {{in a corner of the}} churchyard of Dunbarton, usually {{assigned}} to criminals. Here, among the dust of the guilty, lies a youth, whose name, had he survived the ruin of the fatal events by which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurried</b> into crime, might have adorned the annals of the brave.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> had <b>been</b> <b>hurrying</b> me to {{the stairs}} all the time, and I began slowly to ascend them. He stood down in the white stone hall, {{watching}} me anxiously.|$|R
6000|$|Elisabeth shrugged her shoulders. It {{is given}} to women to {{understand}} much! [...] . The car glided off. As they neared {{the corner of the}} Square, they passed a stout, foreign-looking man with an enormous head, a soft grey hat set far back, a quantity of fair hair, and the ingenuous, eager look of a child. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> towards the corner house and scarcely glanced in their direction. Mr. Foley, however, leaned forward with interest.|$|R
60|$|Of course, in {{the early}} days of {{navigation}} there were no charts of the ocean. The navigator knew not whither <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> over the wild waste of waters; but by observing the relative position of some of the fixed stars to his course while sailing out to sea, he could form a rough idea of the proper course to steer in order to return to the port whence he had started.|$|R
60|$|Columbine bade her a hurried good-by and ventured {{forth with}} misgivings. And almost {{around the corner}} of the second cabin, which she had to pass, and before she had time to recover her composure, she saw Wilson Moore, hobbling along on a crutch, holding a bandaged foot off the ground. He had seen her; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> to avoid a meeting, or to get behind the corrals there before she {{observed}} him.|$|R
60|$|I {{had no more}} of {{his company}} {{for the rest of}} the morning. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> swept off in the vortex that {{followed}} in the wake of this lady. Once indeed he paused for a moment, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurrying</b> on some errand of the good lady's, to let me know that this was Lady Lillycraft, a sister of the Squire's, of large fortune, which the captain would inherit, and that her estate lay in one of the best sporting counties in all England.|$|R
2500|$|Tayfield {{made his}} debut for Natal as a 17-year-old in 1945–46. He took a hat-trick against Transvaal aged just 18 and, when Athol Rowan <b>was</b> injured, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurried</b> into the test team against Australia in 1949–50. He played in all five Tests and, on a sticky wicket at Durban, took seven for 23 when Australia crashed from 31 for no wicket to 75 all out. South Africa erred by not {{enforcing}} the follow on and Neil Harvey won the match for Australia.|$|R
6000|$|They {{started with}} several cowboys {{to search the}} house. They went through the rooms searching, calling out, peering into dark places. It struck Duane more than {{forcibly}} that Lawson did all the calling. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>hurried,</b> too, tried to keep in the lead. Duane wondered if he knew his voice would be recognized by the hiding man. Be that as it might, it was Duane who peered into a dark corner and then, with a gun leveled, said [...] "Come out!" ...|$|R
