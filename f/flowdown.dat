40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to create {{actionable}} knowledge, thereby supporting and stimulating practitioners to improve processes in the financial services sector. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on a case base of improvement projects in financial service organizations. The data consist of 181 improvement projects of processes in 14 financial service organizations executed between 2004 and 2010. Following the case-based reasoning approach, based on retrospective analysis of the documentation of these improvement projects, this paper aims to structure this knowledge in a way that supports practitioners in defining improvement projects in their own organizations. Findings - Identification of eight generic project definition templates, along with their critical to quality <b>flowdowns</b> and operational definitions. An overview of the distribution of improvement projects of each generic template over different departments and the average benefit per project for each department. The generic templates give people with knowledge about the process under improvement the ability to use their knowledge effectively in the form of an improvement project. Originality/value - Due to increasing international competition, financial service organizations must continuously improve in order to secure a competitive advantage. This paper turns continuous improvement from an abstract concept into something tangible and achievable, by giving practitioners with local knowledge tried and tested templates to identify promising themes for process improvement, and to make effective project definitions...|$|R

Because of the complexities {{of different types of}} astrometric observations, these requirements cannot be used to specify system design parameters directly.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} yet poorly defined aspects of engineering a complex aerospace system is behavior engineering, including definition, specification, design, implementation, and verification and validation of the system's behaviors. This is especially true for behaviors of highly autonomous and intelligent systems. Behavior engineering is more of an art than a science. As a process it is generally ad-hoc, poorly specified, and inconsistently applied from one project to the next.

This estimate is a key for planning and decision making in an operational setting. While technology solutions have made considerable advances, the tie-in into the systems engineering process is lagging behind, which delays fielding of PHM-enabled systems. The derivation of specifications from high level requirements for algorithm performance to ensure quality predictions is not well developed. From an engineering perspective some key parameters driving the requirements for prognostics performance include: (1) maximum allowable Probability of Failure (PoF) of the prognostic system to bound {{the risk of losing}} an asset, (2) tolerable limits on proactive maintenance to minimize missed opportunity of asset usage, (3) lead time to specify the amount of advanced warning needed for actionable decisions, and (4) required confidence to specify when prognosis is sufficiently good to be used.

Unlike its companions, however, AXAF will be placed in a high altitude, highly elliptical orbit (10, 000 x 100, 000 km), and will therefore be subject to its own unique environment, spacecraft and science instrument constraints and communication network interactions. In support of this mission, ground operations personnel have embarked on the development of the AXAF Offline System (OFLS), a body of software divided into four basic functional elements: (1) Mission Planning and Scheduling, (2) Command Management, (3) Altitude Determination and Sensor Calibration and (4) Spacecraft Support and Engineering Analysis. This paper presents an overview concept for one of these major elements, the Mission Planning and Scheduling subsystem (MPS). The derivation of this concept is described in terms of requirements driven by spacecraft and science instrument characteristics, orbital environment and ground system capabilities.

40|$|This report {{contains}} a specification of requirements for a video-on-demand (VoD) application developed at Belgacom, {{used as a}} trial application in the 2 RARE project. The specification contains three parts: an informal specification in natural language; a semiformal specification consisting {{of a number of}} diagrams intended to illustrate the informal specification; and a formal specification that makes the requiremants on the desired software system precise. The informal specification is structured {{in such a way that}} it resembles official specification documents conforming to standards such as that of IEEE or ESA. The semiformal specification uses some of the tools in from a requirements engineering toolkit called TRADE (Toolkit for Requirements And Design Engineering). The purpose of TRADE is to combine the best ideas in current structured and object-oriented analysis and design methods within a traditional systems engineering framework. In the case of the VoD system, the systems engineering framework is useful because it provides techniques for allocation and <b>flowdown</b> of system functions to components. TRADE consists of semiformal techniques taken from structured and object-oriented analysis as well as a formal specification langyage, which provides constructs that correspond to the semiformal constructs.

40|$|The LISA mission observes {{gravitational}} waves {{by measuring the}} separations between freely floating proof masses located 5 million kilometers apart with an accuracy of - 10 picometers. The separations are measured interferometrically. The telescope is an afocal Cassegrain style design with a magnification of 80 x. The entrance pupil has a 40 cm diameter and will either be centered on-axis or de-centered off-axis to avoid obscurations. Its two main purposes are to transform the small diameter beam used on the optical bench to a diffraction limited collimated beam to efficiently transfer the metrology laser between spacecraft, and to receive the incoming light from the far spacecraft. It transmits and receives simultaneously. The basic optical design and requirements are well understood for a conventional telescope design for imaging applications, but the LISA design {{is complicated by the}} additional requirement that the total optical path through the telescope must remain stable at the picometer level over the measurement band during the mission to meet the measurement accuracy.

40|$|Air {{traffic demand}} is growing. New methods of {{airspace}} design are required that can enable new designs, do {{not depend on}} current operations, and can also support quantifiable performance goals. The main goal of this thesis is to develop methods to model inherent safety and control cost so that these can be included as principal objectives of airspace design, in support of prior work which examines capacity. The first contribution of the thesis is to demonstrate two applications of airspace analysis and design: assessing the inherent safety and control cost of the airspace. Two results are shown, a model which estimates control cost depending on autonomy allocation and traffic volume, and the characterization of inherent safety conditions which prevent unsafe trajectories. The effects of autonomy ratio and traffic volume on control cost emerge from a Monte Carlo simulation of air traffic in an airspace sector. A maximum likelihood estimation identifies the Poisson process {{to be the best}} stochastic model for control cost. Recommendations are made to support control-cost-centered airspace design. A novel method to reliably generate collision avoidance advisories, in piloted simulations, by the widely-used Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) is used to construct unsafe trajectory clusters. Results show that the inherent safety of routes can be characterized, determined, and predicted by relatively simple convex polyhedra (albeit multi-dimensional and involving spatial and kinematic information). Results also provide direct trade-off relations between spatial and kinematic constraints on route geometries that preserve safety. Accounting for these clusters thus supports safety-centered airspace design. The second contribution of the thesis is a general methodology that generalizes unifying principles from these two demonstrations. The proposed methodology has three steps: aggregate data, synthesize lean model, and guide design. The use of lean models is a result of a natural <b>flowdown</b> from the airspace view to the requirements. The scope of the lean model is situated at a level of granularity that identifies the macroscopic effects of operational changes on the strategic level. The lean model technique maps low-level changes to high-level properties and provides predictive results. The use of lean models allows the mapping of design variables (route geometry, autonomy allocation) to design evaluation metrics (inherent safety, control cost). Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|The New Worlds, New Horizons (NWNH) in Astronomy and Astrophysics 2010 Decadal Survey {{prioritized}} {{the community}} consensus for ground-based and space-based observatories. Recognizing {{that many of}} the community s key questions could be answered with a wide-field infrared survey telescope in space, and that the decade would be one of budget austerity, WFIRST was top ranked in the large space mission category. In addition to the powerful new science that could be accomplished with a wide-field infrared telescope, the WFIRST mission was determined to be both technologically ready and {{only a small fraction of}} the cost of previous flagship missions, such as HST or JWST. In response to the top ranking by the community, NASA formed the WFIRST Science Definition Team (SDT) and Project Office. The SDT was charged with fleshing out the NWNH scientific requirements to a greater level of detail. NWNH evaluated the risk and cost of the JDEM-Omega mission design, as submitted by NASA, and stated that it should serve as the basis for the WFIRST mission. The SDT and Project Office were charged with developing a mission optimized for achieving the science goals laid out by the NWNH re-port. The SDT and Project Office opted to use the JDEM-Omega hardware configuration as an initial start-ing point for the hardware implementation. JDEM-Omega and WFIRST both have an infrared imager with a filter wheel, as well as counter-dispersed moderate resolution spectrometers. The primary advantage of space observations is being above the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs, scatters, warps and emits light. Observing from above the atmosphere enables WFIRST to obtain precision infrared measurements of the shapes of galaxies for weak lensing, infrared light-curves of supernovae and exoplanet microlensing events with low systematic errors, and infrared measurements of the H hydrogen line to be cleanly detected in the 1 <z< 2 redshift range important for baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) dark energy measurements. The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), Herschel, Spitzer, and Wide-field Infrared Sur-vey Explorer (WISE) are all space missions that have produced stunning new scientific advances by going to space to observe in the infrared.
