40|$|The interestingness {{measures}} for pattern associations proposed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> mining literature depend {{only on the}} observation of relative frequencies obtained from 2 × 2 contingency tables.

This enables to capture surprising association rules. Indeed, its underlying principle can be related to that of information theory philosophy; but at a relational level. Two facets are developed for this index: symmetrical and asymmetrical. Two stages are needed to build this index. The first is “local” and associated with the two single boolean attributes to be compared.

Since reliable data on its epidemiology in Brazil are not available, the difficulty to diagnose, varied clinical presentation, and absence of specific laboratory data, case reports are important. This is the first report of this transfusion reaction <b>indexed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> LILACS <b>data</b> base.

When a traditional method is used for pattern string matching, it will occupy a lot of memories and network resources, thereby reducing the positioning effect of <b>the</b> specific object <b>in</b> <b>the</b> big <b>data</b> environment. A positioning method for a specific object of high performance and multi-pattern matching based on three <b>indexes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> big <b>data</b> network environment is proposed in this paper.

The essential contribution of the model is to provide a basic microfoundation for the opportunity/meeting biases that, as the literature highlights, are a crucial element of the phenomenon. Under the assumption that search is more effective <b>in</b> large pools, <b>the</b> equilibrium is characterized by a threshold in terms of group size: large groups only search among similar agents while smaller groups search <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole population.
