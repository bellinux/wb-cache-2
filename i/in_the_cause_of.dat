5|$|Following his {{appointment}} as a judge, Hand became politically active <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> New Nationalism. With reservations, in 1911 he supported Theodore Roosevelt's return to national politics. He {{approved of the}} former president's plans to legislate {{on behalf of the}} underprivileged and to control corporations, as well as of his campaign against the abuse of judicial power. Hand sought to influence Roosevelt's views on these subjects, both in person and in print, and wrote articles for Roosevelt's magazine, The Outlook. His hopes of swaying Roosevelt were often dashed. Roosevelt's poor grasp of legal issues particularly exasperated Hand.|$|E
5|$|In Strasbourg, Bucer {{joined a}} team of notable reformers: Zell, who took {{the role of the}} preacher to the masses; Wolfgang Capito, the most {{influential}} theologian in the city; and Caspar Hedio, the cathedral preacher. One of Bucer's first actions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> reform was to debate with Thomas Murner, a monk who had attacked Luther in satires. While the city council vacillated on religious issues, the number of people supporting the Reformation and hostile towards the traditional clergy had grown.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to Parliament in 1922, Lansbury was denied office in the brief Labour {{government}} of 1924, although he served as First Commissioner of Works in the Labour government of 1929–31. After {{the political and economic}} crisis of August 1931, Lansbury did not follow his leader, Ramsay MacDonald, into the National Government, but remained with the Labour Party. As the most senior of the small contingent of Labour MPs that survived the 1931 general election, Lansbury became the Leader of the Labour Party. His pacifism and his opposition to rearmament in the face of rising European fascism put him at odds with his party, and when his position was rejected at the 1935 Labour Party conference, he resigned the leadership. He spent his final years travelling through the United States and Europe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> peace and disarmament.|$|E
40|$|We examine to {{what extent}} there exists {{heterogeneity}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> a banking crisis. For this purpose, we use a random coefficient logit model including 110 countries between 1970 and 2007. We conclude that there exists significant heterogeneity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> a banking crisis. We find that a high credit growth, a negative GDP growth and a high real interest rate are on average <b>the</b> most important <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> a banking crisis. However, none of the variables has a significant impact in more than 60 percent of the banking crises. Besides {{we find that the}} impact of the determinants differ between systemic and non-systemic crises and across stages of economic development. Banking crises Random coefficient logit model...|$|R

5|$|Born in Warsaw and {{following}} in his father's footsteps, he {{became interested in}} politics {{at an early age}} and soon became involved in the military and the revolutionary affairs in Poland (the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). Pulaski was one of the leading military commanders for the Bar Confederation and fought against Russian domination of the Commonwealth. When this uprising failed, he was driven into exile. Following a recommendation by Benjamin Franklin, Pulaski emigrated to North America to help <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the American Revolutionary War. He distinguished himself throughout the revolution, most notably when he saved the life of George Washington. Pulaski became a general in the Continental Army, created the Pulaski Cavalry Legion and reformed the American cavalry as a whole. At the Battle of Savannah, while leading a daring charge against British forces, he was gravely wounded, and died shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of his life, Rabi {{received}} many honors in addition to the Nobel Prize. These included the Elliott Cresson Medal from the Franklin Institute in 1942, the Medal for Merit and the King's Medal for Service <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cause</b> <b>of</b> Freedom from Great Britain in 1948, the officer in the French Legion of Honour in 1956, Columbia University's Barnard Medal for Meritorious Service to Science in 1960, the Niels Bohr International Gold Medal and the Atoms for Peace Award in 1967, the Oersted Medal from the American Association of Physics Teachers in 1982, the Four Freedoms Award from the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute and the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1985, and the Vannevar Bush Award from the National Science Foundation in 1986. He was a Fellow of the American Physical Society, serving as its president in 1950, {{and a member of the}} National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was internationally recognized with membership in the Japan Academy and the Brazilian Academy of Sciences, and in 1959 was appointed a member of the Board of Governors of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.|$|E
5|$|Mathias Brugman (1811–1868) {{was the son}} of Pierre Brugman from Curaçao of Dutch-Jewish ancestry and Isabel Duliebre from Puerto Rico. His parents met {{and married}} in New Orleans, Louisiana where Brugman was born, raised and educated. The Brugman family moved to Puerto Rico and settled in the City of Mayagüez where Brugman met and married Ana Maria Laborde. He opened a colmado (grocery store) and became rather successful, only to lose a good part of his fortune {{attempting}} to grow coffee. Like many other residents of Puerto Rico at the time, he resented the political injustices practiced by Spain on the island. This led him to become a believer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the Puerto Rican independence movement.|$|E

25|$|Avalanche {{accidents}} are broadly differentiated into 2 categories: accidents in recreational settings, and accidents in residential, industrial, and transportation settings. This distinction {{is motivated by}} <b>the</b> observed difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> avalanche accidents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two settings. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> recreational setting most {{accidents are}} <b>caused</b> by <b>the</b> people involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> avalanche. <b>In</b> a 1996 study, Jamieson et al. (pages 7–20) found that 83% of all avalanches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recreational setting were caused by those who were involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> accident. <b>In</b> contrast, all of <b>the</b> accidents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> residential, industrial, and transportation settings were due to spontaneous natural avalanches. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> avalanche accidents, and <b>the</b> activities pursued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two settings, avalanche and disaster management professionals have developed two related preparedness, rescue, and recovery strategies {{for each of the}} settings.|$|R
5|$|Well over 200 virus strains are implicated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> {{the common}} cold; the rhinoviruses {{are the most}} common. They spread through the air during close contact with {{infected}} people and indirectly through contact with objects in the environment followed by transfer to the mouth or nose. Risk factors include going to daycare, not sleeping well, and psychological stress. Symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. People with influenza often show similar symptoms as people with a cold, though symptoms are usually more severe in the former. Influenza {{is less likely to}} result in a runny nose.|$|E
5|$|When news {{first arrived}} that Philip was in Elatea, {{just three days}} march away, there was panic in Athens. In what Cawkwell {{describes}} as his proudest moment, Demosthenes alone counseled against despair, and proposed that the Athenians should seek an alliance with the Thebans; his decree was passed, and he was sent as ambassador. Philip had also sent an embassy to Thebes, requesting that the Thebans join him, or at least allow him to pass through Boeotia unhindered. Since the Thebans were still not formally at war with Philip, they could have avoided the conflict altogether. However, in spite of Philip's proximity, and their traditional enmity with Athens, they chose to ally with the Athenians, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> liberty for Greece. The Athenian army had already pre-emptively been sent {{in the direction of}} Boeotia, and was therefore able to join the Thebans within days of the alliance being agreed.|$|E
