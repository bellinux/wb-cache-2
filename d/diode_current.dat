40|$|The paper {{presents}} an operating-mode analysis of an MIS solar cell and discusses the advantages which can arise {{as a result}} of the use of transport control, field shaping (increased n factor), and zero bias barrier height modification. It is noted that for an n-type semiconductor, it is relatively easy to obtain an enhanced n factor using acceptor-like states without an increase in <b>diode</b> saturation <b>current,</b> the converse being true for p-type semiconductors. Several MIS configurations are examined: an acceptor-like, localized state configuration producing field shaping and no change in <b>diode</b> saturation <b>current,</b> and acceptor-like localized configurations producing field shaping, with a decrease of <b>diode</b> saturation <b>current,</b> in one case, and an increase in the other...|$|R

50|$|Moreover, in {{a tunnel}} diode the current reaches {{a minimum of}} about 20% of the peak current before rising again towards higher voltages.

50|$|Many SSRs use optical coupling. The {{control voltage}} energizes an {{internal}} LED which illuminates and switches on a photo-sensitive diode (photo-voltaic); the <b>diode</b> <b>current</b> {{turns on a}} back-to-back thyristor, SCR, or MOSFET to switch the load.

50|$|When {{the input}} is positive, it is amplified by the {{operational}} amplifier which switches the <b>diode</b> on. <b>Current</b> {{flows through the}} load and, because of the feedback, the output voltage {{is equal to the}} input voltage.|$|R
50|$|With {{a further}} {{increase}} in t, the AC voltage becomes negative, {{and the field}} in the avalanche region drops below its critical value. The electrons in the avalanche region are then injected into the drift zone which induces a current in the external circuit which has a phase opposite to that of the AC voltage. The AC field, therefore, absorbs energy from the drifting electrons as they are decelerated by the decreasing field. It is clear that an ideal phase shift between the <b>diode</b> <b>current</b> and the AC signal is achieved if the thickness of the drift zone is such that the bunch of electron is collected at the n+ - anode at the moment the AC voltage goes to zero. This condition is achieved by making the length of the drift region equal to the wavelength of the signal. This situation produces an additional phase shift of 90° between the AC voltage and the <b>diode</b> <b>current.</b>|$|E
50|$|The voltage versus current {{characteristics}} of an LED {{are similar to}} any <b>diode.</b> <b>Current</b> is approximately an exponential function of voltage according to the Shockley diode equation, and a small voltage change {{may result in a}} large change in current. If the voltage is below or equal to the threshold no current flows and the result is an unlit LED.

50|$|A {{well known}} {{application}} of this method is the approximation of the transfer function of a pn junction diode. The actual transfer function of an ideal diode has been given {{at the top of}} this (non-linear) section. However, this formula is rarely used in network analysis, a piecewise approximation being used instead. It can be seen that the <b>diode</b> <b>current</b> rapidly diminishes to -Io as the voltage falls. This current, for most purposes, is so small it can be ignored. With increasing voltage, the current increases exponentially. The diode is modelled as an open circuit up to the knee of the exponential curve, then past this point as a resistor equal to the bulk resistance of the semiconducting material.|$|E
50|$|The {{idealized}} waveforms {{shown above}} are seen for both {{voltage and current}} when the load on the bridge is resistive. When the load includes a smoothing capacitor, both the voltage and the current waveforms will be greatly changed. While the voltage is smoothed, as described above, current will flow through the bridge only during {{the time when the}} input voltage is greater than the capacitor voltage. For example, if the load draws an average current of n Amps, and the diodes conduct for 10% of the time, the average <b>diode</b> <b>current</b> during conduction must be 10n Amps. This non-sinusoidal current leads to harmonic distortion and a poor power factor in the AC supply.|$|E
