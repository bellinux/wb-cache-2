40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{take a look}} at what I take to be the best {{argument}} for <b>dispositions.</b> According to this argument we need <b>dispositions</b> in order to understand certain features of scientific practice. I point out that these <b>dispositions</b> have to be continuously manifestable. Furthermore I will argue that <b>dispositions</b> are not the causes of their manifestations. However, <b>dispositions</b> and causation are closely connected. What it is to be a cause can best be understood in terms of counterfactuals that are based on <b>dispositions...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article aims {{to define}} and clarify the concept of {{thinking}} <b>dispositions,</b> sketch its historical background, and introduce some empirical studies that {{make a case for}} the importance of <b>dispositions</b> in any account of the mechanisms of intelligent behavior. We take up these themes by addressing six questions in turn, as follows: Dispositional Aspects of Intelligence 4 1. What are thinking <b>dispositions?</b> 2. Why are thinking <b>dispositions</b> important in modeling intelligent behavior? 3. Can thinking <b>dispositions</b> be measured and how? 4. How much do thinking <b>dispositions</b> contribute to intelligent behavior? 5. How do thinking <b>dispositions</b> relate to thinking abilities? 6. What kinds of thinking <b>dispositions</b> are there? Inevitably, such an inquiry confronts the issue of what intelligence, as a technical concept, should mean. The last section addresses this question directly and attempts to place the notion of <b>dispositions</b> within a broad conception of intelligenc...|$|R

40|$|This inquiry {{seeks to}} {{identify}} the beliefs of college students prior to their entry into a teacher education program (pre-program students), teacher educators, practicing P- 12 teachers, and practicing P- 12 administrators (teacher education professionals) related to the construct “dispositions” in teacher education. Grounded in a social constructivist understanding of teaching and learning, this primarily phenomenological study utilizes the analysis of survey data to uncover and explore multiple perspectives on beliefs about <b>dispositions</b> in teacher education {{in an effort to}} identify implications for teacher education research and practice. Findings suggest that pre-program students and teacher education professionals believe that <b>dispositions</b> {{are an important part of}} quality teaching. Although their definitions and understandings about what this construct, <b>dispositions,</b> refers to, participants list a host of <b>dispositions</b> that they believe teachers ought to have. Teacher education professionals also believe that candidate <b>dispositions</b> can and should be explicitly developed and assessed in teacher education, but there is a fair amount of discomfort surrounding assessment. Implications for teacher education relate to the importance of student beliefs in developing <b>dispositions,</b> the connection between <b>dispositions,</b> knowledge, and skills, the importance of the connection between coursework and fieldwork in the development of <b>dispositions,</b> the development of teacher education professionals’ capacity to attend to <b>dispositions,</b> and an approach to <b>dispositions</b> development that embraces the myriad <b>dispositions</b> listed by participants in this inquiry...|$|R
40|$|Globally, teacher <b>dispositions</b> {{along with}} {{knowledge}} and skills {{continue to be the}} focal point of teacher education programs. Teachers influence children’s development and therefore <b>dispositions</b> are a universal concern. For the past 20 years in the United States, teacher education programs have assessed <b>dispositions.</b> We, however, must now also use these assessment results to ensure that teacher candidates are graduating with the knowledge, skills and <b>dispositions</b> to be effective teachers. In this paper, the authors use case study examples to discuss teacher candidates with problematic <b>dispositions</b> and the resulting improvement plan and process using the Preparing Reflective and Effective Practitioners (PDQ-PREP), developed by the authors. The goal of this process is to ensure that all teacher candidates have the opportunity to reflect on their actions and develop or refine the <b>dispositions</b> necessary to be effective professionals.

40|$|Given their {{physical}} realization, what causal work is left for functional properties to do? Humean {{solutions to the}} exclusion problem (e. g. overdetermination and difference-making) typically appeal to counterfactual and/or nomic relations between functional property-instances and behavioural effects, tacitly assuming that such relations suffice for causal work. Clarification {{of the notion of}} causal work, I argue, shows not only that such solutions don't work, but also reveals a novel solution to the exclusion problem based on the relations between dispositional properties at different levels of mechanism, which involves three central claims: (i) the causal work of properties consists in grounding <b>dispositions,</b> (ii) functional properties are <b>dispositions,</b> and (iii) the <b>dispositions</b> of mechanisms are grounded in the <b>dispositions</b> of their components. Treating functional mental properties as <b>dispositions</b> of components in psychological mechanisms, I argue that such properties do the causal work of grounding agent-level <b>dispositions.</b> These <b>dispositions,</b> while ultimately grounded in the physical realizers of mental properties, are indirectly so grounded, through a hierarchy of grounding relations that extends upwards, of necessity, through the mental domain...|$|R
40|$|PhD, Education, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2012 This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{in an attempt}} to determine the degree to which second year Mathematics education students consider critical thinking <b>dispositions</b> and attitudes to be important and to develop a curriculum-based mediational approach based on the data, to encourage the critical thinking <b>dispositions</b> and attitudes that appeared to be in need of encouragement. A literature study was undertaken to determine the positive critical thinking <b>dispositions</b> and attitudes students should possess. In addition it was also determined which teaching learning approaches will benefit the development of critical thinking <b>dispositions</b> and attitudes the most. The advantages as well as the processes and components that should form part of the mediational approach for the development of critical thinking <b>dispositions</b> were examined. A two-phase, sequential, explanatory mixed method study was subsequently undertaken with second-year Mathematics students at a South African university. The quantitative study made use of a self-developed questionnaire to determine the degree to which students consider critical thinking <b>dispositions</b> and attitudes important. Data emanating from the questionnaires were analysed and questions that had to be answered in narrative format were set for each student according to their own responses on the questionnaire. Narratives formed part of the qualitative component of the study in which students had to indicate factors that influence their critical thinking <b>dispositions</b> and attitudes, what could be done to improve the apparent unimportant critical thinking <b>dispositions</b> and attitudes and whether they regard the critical thinking <b>dispositions</b> and attitudes as important. Narratives were analysed and the results were used to explain the quantitative data. Results revealed that second year Mathematics education students do not consider critical thinking <b>dispositions</b> and attitudes, in particular inquisitiveness but also judiciousness, open-mindedness, systematicity, truth-seeking, analyticity and confidence in critical thinking to be very important and therefore these critical thinking <b>dispositions</b> and attitudes appeared to require encouragement. A curriculum-based mediational approach based on a section in the existing Mathematics module for second year education students was developed in order to encourage critical thinking <b>dispositions</b> in Mathematics. The study concluded with recommendations to encourage critical thinking <b>dispositions</b> and attitudes as well as proposals for future studies. Doctora...|$|R

40|$|This study {{arose from}} {{questions}} surrounding {{the performances of}} school students in Australia and Finland in international comparative studies and the {{factors that contribute to}} the differences between these two countries. Specifically, investigation into student <b>dispositions</b> towards learning in Australia and Finland was pursued. Although Finnish students have consistently taken the lead in international academic comparative studies, this project found that as a group their <b>dispositions</b> towards learning are not necessarily more positive than those belonging to Australian students. Using the extensive datasets from OECD’s 2000, 2003 and 2006 PISA studies, this project selected items that were specific to student <b>dispositions</b> and conducted quantitative statistical analysis to unearth posited information regarding student <b>dispositions</b> and performance. Research results found that within each country, increasingly positive <b>dispositions</b> were related to improved performance. However, when student <b>dispositions</b> towards learning in Australia and Finland were compared, more positive <b>dispositions</b> did not always equate to higher performance. This project examined these differences and the disparities between the students’ <b>dispositions</b> and performance levels to find the crucial importance of cultural capital in the home and school environments. Accordingly, suggestions for improving Australian student performance and recommendations for further research were made with strong reference to the need to raise cultural capital in Australia.
