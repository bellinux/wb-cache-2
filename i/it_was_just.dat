It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943.

5|$|Finally, the Acurad system {{employed}} a patented double shot piston design. The {{idea was to}} use a second piston (located within the primary piston) to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified {{around the perimeter of}} the casting cavity and shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> as effective to apply sufficient pressure at the right time later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting.|$|E

If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it.

5|$|A {{free agent}} in March 2001, Henderson {{returned}} to the Padres. During the 2001 season, he broke three major league career records and reached an additional major career milestone. He broke Babe Ruth's record of 2,062 career walks, Ty Cobb's record of 2,245 career runs, and Zack Wheat's record of 2,328 career games in left field, and {{on the final day}} of the season collected his 3,000th career hit, a leadoff double off Rockies pitcher John Thomson. That final game was also Padre Tony Gwynn's last major league game, and Henderson had originally wanted to sit out so as not to detract from the occasion, but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play. After scoring the game's first run, Henderson was removed from the lineup. With Gwynn having 3,141 hits, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the second time in Major League history that a pair of teammates each had 3,000 career hits; Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker had previously played many games together for the 1928 A's.|$|E
5|$|Multiple eyewalls {{had been}} {{detected}} in very strong hurricanes before, including Typhoon Sarah and Hurricane Donna, although the double eyes were usually seen in very intense systems. Double eyewalls were also seen post-seeding {{in some of}} the seeded storms. At the time however, the only known times that rapid changes in eyewall diameter, other than during presumably successful seedings, was during rapid changes in intensity. It remained controversial whether the seedings caused the secondary eyewalls or whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a natural cycle. Basically, if eyewall changes similar to those observed in seeded hurricanes were rare in unseeded tropical cyclones, it would provide powerful evidence that Project Stormfury was successful. Conversely, if such changes were common in unseeded systems, it would throw doubt on the very hypothesis and assumptions driving Project Stormfury.|$|E
