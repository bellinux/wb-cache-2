5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} been thought of as agnostic. Pears said that when they met in 1937 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> whether or not Britten would have {{described himself as a}} Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E
5|$|Gray abhorred slavery. In his view, science {{proved the}} unity of all man because all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., all members of a species are {{connected}} genetically. He also felt Christianity taught {{the unity of}} man. He was not an abolitionist, feeling {{it was more important}} to preserve the Union, yet he also felt if the South persevered in the conflict, every slave should be set free, by use of more force if necessary. However, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> what should be done with the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015 in {{his column}} in Weekly Famitsu, Sakurai alluded to the {{possibility}} of retirement, expressing doubt that {{he would be able to}} continue making games if his career continued to be as stressful as it was. In December 2015, Sakurai once again stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> if there will be another Smash Bros. game in the series. In January 2016, it was rumoured that a Super Smash Bros. game was being developed by Bandai Namco and that the game was planned as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch. However, the rumour was debunked upon the release of the Switch.|$|E

5|$|In the January 1977 {{issue of}} Starlog, Roddenberry said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> when the novel would be complete, but {{confirmed}} {{that it would}} discuss the meaning of God. By March 1978, the novel {{was said to be}} half-completed. Publisher Bantam Books told Roddenberry it would wait until he finished production on Phase II to resume work on the novel. When later in 1978 that production turned into The Motion Picture, Bantam gave Roddenberry an extension because the novelization was thought to be a full-time effort.|$|E
5|$|Albert Brooks guest {{starred in}} the episode {{as the voice of}} Cowboy Bob. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> if he wanted to be {{identified}} with a cartoon show or not at the time, like many of the other early guest stars on The Simpsons, and was therefore credited as A. Brooks in the ending credits. This episode was a satire of the Bigfoot specials that had aired on the Fox network at the time when this episode was written. A lot of resources were spent on the backgrounds in the episode, trying to make them look realistic with many observational details such as trees, rocks, fences and the way the cars were positioned. Burger King figurines were made out of the camping designs of the Simpsons family in this episode.|$|E
5|$|On 8 September 1994 the DoD {{announced}} the actions {{it would take}} {{in response to the}} investigation's findings. May was charged with 26 counts of negligent homicide by military legal authorities. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson were charged with dereliction of duty. All of those charged faced an Article 32 hearing in which it would be decided if they should be tried by court-martial or the matter disposed of otherwise. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson faced a joint Article 32 hearing while May's hearing was separate. Wickson was not charged. Although not explicitly stated by USAF leaders, it appears that Wickson was not charged but May was because Wickson had testified that he was sure of his identification of the two Black Hawks as hostile Hinds, while May had stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> of Wickson's identification but had allowed the engagement to proceed anyway.|$|E

5000|$|The real {{grievance}} of {{the worker}} is the insecurity of his existence; <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>he</b> will always have work, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>he</b> will always <b>be</b> healthy, and <b>he</b> foresees that he {{will one day be}} old and unfit to work. If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> then completely helpless, left to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if <b>he</b> has <b>been</b> working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.|$|R
5|$|When {{dramatic}} plot developments made Sasuke {{one of the}} series' antagonists, Kishimoto compared him and Naruto to the yin {{and yang}} due to their notable differences and complementary natures. He has mentioned that when one progresses, he makes sure the other does as well. In 2013, as the series approached its climax, Kishimoto encouraged readers {{to look forward to}} Sasuke and Naruto's final fight. Since it started serialization, Kishimoto had planned that the series' ending would feature the final fight between the two characters, although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> whether the characters would end the duel as friends or enemies. While the two use ninja techniques in the beginning, in the climax the author wanted both fighters to rely on hand-to-hand combat. In the end, Kishimoto decided to have Naruto forgive Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato, another former enemy. Anime staff Chengxi Huang said the animated adaptation of this fight, the group worked carefully to depict the action in every scene by showing changes on Sasuke and Naruto's clothes and hair. Huang added he felt fatigue by working so much into this fight due to reaching 70 successive cuts at a time.|$|E
5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E

25|$|During {{the session}} {{a list of}} {{potential}} witnesses was also made public.

At the hearing several other possible witnesses were listed, including the prerecorded video depositions of three Iraqi prisoners — two for the prosecution {{and one for the}} defense.

25|$|A {{month after}} the disappearance, CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya {{acknowledged}} that ticket sales had declined but did not provide specific details. This may be partially resulted from the suspension of the airline's advertisement campaigns following the disappearance. In China, {{where the majority of}} Flight 370 victims were from, bookings on Malaysia Airlines were down 60% in March. He said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> when the airline could start repairing its image, but that the airline was adequately insured to cover the financial loss stemming from the incident. In August, the airline warned of poor second-half earnings, citing a 33% decline in average weekly bookings following the loss of Flight 17. Media reported that some flights were largely empty and that the airline had slashed prices well below competitors on several key routes.|$|E
25|$|The match {{had already}} had a moment of {{controversy}} earlier. During the Australian innings, Martin Snedden claimed a low outfield catch off the batting of Greg Chappell when Chappell was on 58. It was ruled not out by the umpires. It was some years before TV replays {{could be used in}} umpiring decisions. Viewers watching replays had divided opinions: some thought it was a clean catch, while others say it passed through the fielder's fingers to touch the grass before coming to rest in his hands. (If modern TV umpiring review had been in use, there was sufficient doubt to rule it not out.) Some commentators believed that Chappell should have taken Snedden's word that the catch was good, as had been a time honoured tradition. Chappell maintained <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> about the catch and was within his rights to wait for the umpires to rule. Chappell went on to score 90, before he was caught by Bruce Edgar in similar fashion. This time, Chappell walked after he clearly saw the fielder had cupped his hands under the ball.|$|E
