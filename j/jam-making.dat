500|$|When it was founded, {{the school}} was {{considered}} an experiment. Its goal was [...] "to open an independent means of livelihood for young men and women, especially of our cities; to demonstrate that higher values may be obtained from land under intelligent management, {{and to develop a}} taste for rural life." [...] Most students were trained in garden and farm operations in a two-year course, with short summer courses in nature study also offered. The academic year had three terms, with twelve weeks of vacation. Although the school allowed new students to begin at any term, a September start was considered the most desirable. Instruction was offered in agriculture, horticulture, cold storage, botany, chemistry, geology, physics, agricultural zoology, entomology, beekeeping, meteorology, land surveying and leveling, soils, drainage, irrigation, tillage, fertilizers, plant diseases, stock, fruit growing, landscape gardening and bookkeeping. It was a practical school, with no attempt to provide a general education. Work included caring for orchard trees and bush fruit, greenhouse culture of fruits and vegetables, jelly- and <b>jam-making,</b> market gardening, tillage, fertilizer use, hybridizing and propagating flowers, harvesting and marketing crops. The school used Briarcliff Farms, where students worked the land, tested milk and cared for a variety of animals. Students also raised flowers, vegetables and fruit, and accompanied their products to cities for marketing. The New York Botanical Garden arranged with the school for student access to its lectures, museums and conservatories. Tuition was $100 a year ($ in [...] ), and board $280 a year ($ in [...] ). Instruction was primarily weekday-morning lectures with laboratory work; during the afternoon, students worked on the school farm (which had a foreman, gardener and several workmen to ensure continuous operation) under instructor supervision. In 1901 35 students attended, followed by 34 in 1902 (almost all from cities), ranging in age from 16 to 35. Most had a high-school education before enrolling, and some had been to college. The school had a capacity of 35 students, and planned to expand.|$|E

50|$|Figs can {{be eaten}} fresh or dried, {{and used in}} <b>jam-making.</b> Most {{commercial}} production is in dried or otherwise processed forms, since the ripe fruit does not transport well, and once picked does not keep well. The widely produced fig newton or fig roll is a biscuit (cookie) with a filling made from figs.|$|E
50|$|The {{economy of}} the {{community}} {{has been based on}} farming for most of its existence. There was a short period of mining for coprolite, used to make fertilizer in the late 19th century. The Earl De La Warr sold his estates in Haslingfield to John Chivers who planted fruit for his <b>jam-making</b> factory in Histon.|$|E
50|$|The {{taste of}} the plum fruit ranges from sweet to tart; the skin itself may be {{particularly}} tart. It is juicy and can be eaten fresh or used in <b>jam-making</b> or other recipes. Plum juice can be fermented into plum wine. In central England, a cider-like alcoholic beverage known as plum jerkum is made from plums.|$|E
50|$|The estate's near {{bankruptcy}} {{has been}} a recurring theme in the series. Attempts to rectify this have included a wildlife preserve (with wolves), a <b>jam-making</b> concern (Glenbogle Preserves), and a plan to make Glenbogle Castle into a hotel. It may be assumed that the first two enterprises are continuing; the third failed to gain start-up capital.|$|E
5000|$|Sloss was {{employed}} as a maintenance engineer at a jam factory. He invented (and patented) a method for cutting melons into cubes that involved revolving circular wheels (instead of fixed knife blades) which prevented the fruit being reduced to a pulp.

More than 10,000 men use over 300 sheds.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, {{the berries}} have been {{traditionally}} {{used as an}} ingredient in making jam. The berries are high in pectin which makes the jam congeal as it cools after having been boiled.

5000|$|Long {{associated}} with the total abstinence (temperance) movement in Adelaide, Reynolds was known as [...] "Teapot Tommy". Reynolds was a shrewd business man, a hard worker, and a good treasurer, but was of too sanguine and fiery a temperament to be a politician of the first rank. He was a pioneer in <b>jam-making</b> and raisin-curing in South Australia, but his devotion to his parliamentary duties led sometimes {{to the neglect of}} his own financial interests.|$|E
50|$|Wallis {{was born}} at Macclesfield, a son of Richard Wallis (1826 - 21 December 1897), who was for some time {{connected}} with H. B. Hanton's <b>jam-making</b> business at Fullarton (later taken over by D. & J. Fowler to become the Lion Preserving Company), Kensington, and the East End Markets. In 1863 his parents moved to Norwood, and Frederick began his schooling under James Cowell, later under Thomas Caterer. (Kent Town in 1883, Victoria street, Goodwood West in 1897).|$|E
50|$|The {{area served}} by the railway lay between the GER main line and the coast, mostly {{agricultural}} land, with fruit being a main crop. At Tiptree the <b>jam-making</b> firm Wilkin & Sons, founded in 1885, provided {{a large amount of}} the freight traffic; it had also been hoped that a tourist trade would ensue from the yachts moored near Tollesbury. The line became known locally as The Crab and Winkle Line, although the original railway to bear that name was the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway, which used a play on the initial letters of the line.|$|E
50|$|An {{agricultural}} show {{took place at}} Aldoth until at least the 1960s. It was an annual event, usually taking place in August, and would attract visitors {{from all over the}} local area. Prizes were awarded for livestock, vegetables, baking, knitting, <b>jam-making,</b> and handicrafts, and the local pub erected a beer tent {{for the duration of the}} show. Hound trailing took place, as did harness racing and sulky trotting, and bets were often placed on the outcome of these events. The grand finale would involve a parade of award-winning livestock. In the evening after the show, a dance was often held in Aldoth school.|$|E
50|$|Local {{cakes and}} desserts include Saffron cake, heavy (hevva) cake (similar to Welsh cakes), fairing biscuits, figgy 'obbin, or fuggan, scones (often served with jam and clotted cream) and {{whortleberry}} pie. Baking cakes using yeast {{is more common}} here than {{in the rest of}} England. The Cornish Gilliflower is a variety of apple tree found at Truro in 1813 which was afterwards grown commercially. Other Cornish cultivars include the Cornish Aromatic and the King Byerd. Various fruit trees can be grown in Cornwall but it is not particularly suitable for this. Whortleberries and blackberries can be gathered in some rural areas and homegrown produce can be used for <b>jam-making</b> or puddings.|$|E

Jam is amazed to find that his animals can now talk; the guinea pigs call themselves Pinny and Gig, while the white rat introduces himself as Percy. Jam meets some of the inhabitants, who inform him of local conditions. This remote valley of Oz is dominated by a wrathful giant, fifty feet tall, called Terp the Terrible, who enslaves the common people to work in his vineyards and his <b>jam-making</b> factory. Terp captures Jam, and is struck by his name; the giant threatens to spread the boy on his breakfast muffins the next day, and eat him.

5000|$|There {{is a body}} of anecdotal {{evidence}} that damsons {{were used in the}} British dye and cloth manufacturing industries in the 18th and 19th centuries, with examples occurring in every major damson-growing area (Buckinghamshire, Cheshire, Westmorland, Shropshire and Worcestershire). Stories that damsons were used to dye khaki army uniforms are particularly common. However, a 2005 report for conservancy body English Nature could find no documentary evidence within the dyeing industry that damsons were ever a source of dye, noting that use of natural dyes declined rapidly after the 1850s, and concluded that [...] "there seems no evidence that damsons were used extensively or techniques using them developed". The main recorded use of damsons in the industrial era was in commercial <b>jam-making,</b> and orchards were widespread until the Second World War, after which changing tastes, the effect of wartime sugar rationing, and the relatively high cost of British-grown fruit caused a steep decline.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the winter}} of 1895-96, the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor {{researched}} the causes of youth moving from the country to cities to develop the most efficient method of attracting {{them back to the}} country. That, and an examination of agricultural needs for a year, resulted in meetings at the homes of Abram S. Hewitt and R. Fulton Cutting and the formation of the New York State Committee for the Promotion of Agriculture. The committee, chaired by Hewitt, included Cutting, Jacob H. Schiff, John G. Carlisle, Mrs. Seth Low, Josephine Shaw Lowell, Walter Law and William E. Dodge. Its board of trustees had five officers (with Theodore L. Van Norden president) and seventeen other trustees, including Law, V. Everit Macy and James Speyer. George T. Powell, a [...] "recognized authority on scientific agriculture" [...] according to The New York Times, was consulted; he later organized the school and became its director. When Walter Law was included the school took shape, since he provided its land and building. In September 1900, Law and the committee established the School of Practical Agriculture and Horticulture as part of Briarcliff Farms, on an elevated 66 acre site about midway between the Briarcliff Manor and Pleasantville train stations on Pleasantville Road. Law leased the 66 acres (which were worth $1,000 ($ in [...] ) an acre) for 20 years at the rate of a dollar per year, gave the trustees $30,000 ($ in [...] ) to build a dormitory and promised them $3,000 ($ in [...] ) a year for expenses until the school earned a profit. With that and $30,000 from the trustees, the school opened; the committee focused the curriculum on horticulture, floriculture, gardening and aviculture. The school's progress was followed by members of the public interested in agricultural education.When it was founded, the school was considered an experiment.

40|$|Star {{fruit is}} one of holticulture {{commodity}} with non-climate characteristic, so {{that if it was}} taken before it was riped, it would be wasted since the star fruit could not be shutted. That’s why it is produced as star fruit jam. Jam {{is one of}} half-wet food product. In making jam, there needs a sweet-maker to be added which is sugar. In this research, sugar used was ‘siwalan’ sugar, where it came from ‘siwalan’ tree. There is sucrose inside it, so that it could be used as sweet-maker substance. Beside its attracting colour, it also gave a nice aroma. <b>Jam-making</b> with ‘siwalan’ sugar aimed to give information to the society that beside ordinary sugar, ‘siwalan’ sugar also could be used. In making star fruit jam and ‘siwalan’ sugar, there also additional substance like pectine which functioned to make gel and natrium benzoat as preservative substance, in accordance with the fast-contaminated star fruit. This research aimed to find out the influence of sugar concentrate to the water rate, glucose rate, vitamin C rate and the preference of star fruit jam and also to find out the additional sugar concentrate to produce good quality jam. This research was true experimental and used complete random design with 6 treatment and 5 repeat. The population was red-bangkok star fruit and the samples were 650 gram with simple random sampling.

40|$|The health {{awareness}} recently shown by consumers {{has led to}} a demand for health beneficial products. In particular, researchers are currently focusing their studies on the search for foods for cancer prevention activity. In the present work, we study comparatively the effect of two different processing methods on the contents of phenolic compounds (i. e., ellagic acid, myricetin, quercetin and kaempferol) with antioxidant and antitumor properties in strawberry jams. In turn, the results obtained were compared with those of unprocessed fruit. Additionally carcinogenic heat-induced compounds formed by the two jam making methods were evaluated. Decreases of total ellagic acid from 138. 4 µg/g to 86. 5 µg/g were measured in jam as compared with the intact fruit. Even higher losses of up to 90 % of total flavonols were found in strawberry after the <b>jam-making</b> process. A comparison between the two processing methods proved shorter heating periods (around 60 min) even at temperatures as high as 100 °C enabled losses of antioxidant phenolics to be minimized. Carcinogenic heat-induced volatile compounds, mainly Maillard reaction products, were formed as a result of thermal treatment during jam processing. However, shorter heating periods also helped reduce the formation of these harmful compounds. These results are deeply discussed. From a practical standpoint, the processing conditions here proposed can be used by industry to obtain strawberry jam with higher content of antioxidant flavonoids and, at the same time, reduced amounts of carcinogenic compounds.

With 107 presentations in two days, plus poster sessions, {{bringing}} together {{a total of}} 140 papers, the agroforestry community of southern Africa brought itself up to date at its packed workshop on Agroforestry impacts on livelihoods in southern Africa: putting research into practice. It was, after {{a decade or more}} of research and practice in the region, time to take stock, and the International Center for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF) had caught the mood well, with support from a wide raft of donors and technical agencies, including CTA. The 180 delegates looked back with satisfaction at the options and innovations which have developed with farmers since their last gathering in 1991, including improved fallows for soil fertility, fodder crops for livestock, woodlots on farms, and the domestication of indigenous fruit trees. Through scaling-up, partnerships and replication programmes, hundreds of thousands of farmers are already using these options, and with measurable impact on household and community livelihoods and environmental quality. The challenges ahead are almost as numerous, concluded the meeting s Declaration: more capacity building, a more business-like approach and links with the private sector, mainstreaming gender in research, facing the devastation of HIV/AIDS and malaria, solving the poor supply of planting materials and watch out for this one, it is going to become an art-form in many professions dove-tailing agroforestry into the framework of NEPAD, the New Economic Partnership for African Development.
