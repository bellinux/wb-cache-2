5|$|Ferdinand reluctantly ordered saps to be dug <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain. The sapping was {{difficult}} and dangerous and the sappers worked under continuous {{attack from the}} castle's defenders, who fired on them with small arms and the castle's artillery and dropped rocks and debris on their heads. The forced labor of local peasants minimized losses among Ferdinand's own troops, {{but many of the}} peasants perished in the effort.|$|E

5|$|The castle was rebuilt in {{the late}} 16th century. A new five-storey east range was built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rock, and the {{gatehouse}} was rebuilt, {{this time with a}} permanent stone bridge. The upper part of the east range was renovated in 1622, with renaissance details and carving to door and window surrounds. Roslin suffered again from the artillery of Cromwell’s commander in Scotland, General Monck, in 1650. It was further damaged by a Reforming mob in 1688.|$|E
5|$|In October 1963, London Transport ordered five {{double decker}} buses {{based on the}} Ford Thames Trader chassis for special duties, taking cyclists through the Dartford Tunnel. These had a lower deck {{purpose-built}} for carrying bicycles, with upper deck seats for cyclists. Access was via a stairwell to the upper deck starting several feet above {{the level of the}} road, accessible from special platforms built {{at either end of the}} tunnel; there was also a ladder built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bodywork for access elsewhere. The design was criticised for failing to protect any passenger from falling off the vehicle, and running costs were estimated at £2,550 per month, with only £45 revenue. The service was reduced to one bus in April 1964 and then cancelled in 1965, to be replaced by the current transfer service. One of these buses has been preserved.|$|E

25|$|In an {{overcurrent}} condition, a {{value of}} current will be reached that overcomes the control spring pressure on the spindle and the braking magnet, causing the metal disc to rotate towards the fixed contact. This initial movement of the disc is also held off to a critical positive value of current by small slots that are often cut <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disc. The time taken for rotation to make the contacts is not only dependent on current but also the spindle backstop position, known as the time multiplier (tm). The time multiplier is divided into 10 linear divisions of the full rotation time.|$|E

25|$|Bamiyan {{lies on the}} Silk Road, {{which runs}} through the Hindu Kush {{mountain}} region, in the Bamiyan Valley. The Silk Road has been historically a caravan route linking the markets of China {{with those of the}} Western world. It was the site of several Buddhist monasteries, and a thriving center for religion, philosophy, and art. Monks at the monasteries lived as hermits in small caves carved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bamiyan cliffs. Most of these monks embellished their caves with religious statuary and elaborate, brightly colored frescoes. It was a Buddhist religious site from the 2nd century up to the time of the Islamic invasion in the later half of the 7th century. Until it was completely conquered by the Muslim Saffarids in the 9th century, Bamiyan shared the culture of Gandhara.|$|E
25|$|With McMahon {{turning down}} his number-one {{contender}} spot against The Rock, WWF Commissioner Michaels awarded Austin the title shot {{the next night}} on Raw Is War. At , Stone Cold got a one-on-one match against McMahon in a steel cage match, with the WWF Championship opportunity at WrestleMania XV at stake. During the match, Paul Wight made his debut, breaking through from under the ring and attacking Austin. Wight's attack propelled Austin <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cage forcing the cage to give way and dropping Austin to the floor first, making him the victor. Austin defeated The Rock at WrestleMania XV to win his third WWF Championship. Austin faced The Rock in a rematch at , in which Shane McMahon was the referee. During the match, Vince McMahon approached the ring, only to hand Austin back his Smoking Skull title belt and take Shane out of the proceedings. Austin won the match when another referee made the count. Austin would lose the title to The Undertaker at Over the Edge. Due to events revolving around Vince McMahon, Stephanie and Linda McMahon made Austin the Chief Executive Officer of the company. Vince and Shane McMahon challenged Austin to a handicap ladder match at King of the Ring with the CEO title on the line, which the duo of father and son won. The next night on Raw Is War, Austin {{made it clear that}} while he was the CEO of the company he could have a title shot at any time and place to be determined by himself. Austin made the WWF Championship match that night on Raw Is War and defeated The Undertaker to win his fourth WWF Championship. However, after he won it The Undertaker came and hit him with the title belt, leading to a First Blood match between the two at Fully Loaded, where Mr. McMahon stipulated that if Austin lost he {{would never be able to}} wrestle for the WWF Championship again, and if Austin won he would never see McMahon again. Austin won after interference from X-Pac, hitting The Undertaker with a TV camera and gave McMahon a goodbye Stone Cold Stunner.|$|E
25|$|Through many generations, it {{remained}} in the Taylor family until 1896, when Lucy W. Taylor sold the farm to George and William Bray, two brothers {{who had worked for}} the Taylors, and who were probably distant relatives. The property that Lucy sold for $400 included 50 acres (20 hectares) of uplands and adjacent marshlands which were capable of producing each year six tons of a combination of salt and fresh hay. The deed described the property as being in that part of Yarmouth known as Hockanom. It was sustained as a prosperous working farm by the Bray family until 1941. They continued to harvest salt marsh hay from Black Flat Marsh to feed their farm animals. The Brays often sold their strawberry and blueberry crops from a wheelbarrow on Old Kings Highway. In 1946 Robert J Williams purchased the farm and 88 acres for the tax due on the property. He moved from New Jersey to work for the Buzzards Bay Gas company until he retired. Robert Williams along with wife Katherin and son Robert Jr. lived on the farm and restored and improved the original farmhouse and surrounding land. They also improved the barn and a small apartment built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill under the large ice-age boulder adjacent to the barn. Robert Williams introduced sheep to the farm and maintained them throughout his ownership. Although he worked a full-time job, he raised the sheep like the proud Welshman he was. He showed his sheep all over Massachusetts in county fairs. He sheared them and sold the wool. He also had several large vegetable gardens as well as wild and cultivated blueberries, and raspberries. The farm provided a great deal of food for the family. Robert Jr. built a home up the road for his new wife, and had a son in that house in the mid-1950s. Later he would move the family to south Yarmouth. The grandchildren would spend weekends on the farm up until the mid-1960s. The Williams family sold the farm they loved and cared for to a developer in the 1970s when Katherine became ill and could not keep up with the demands of the property. The terms stipulated that the farmhouse and barn be preserved. The Williams family saved the farm from destruction in the 1940s and in the 1970s. By the late 1980s, ownership changed hands a number of times, and the buildings saw neglect.|$|E
