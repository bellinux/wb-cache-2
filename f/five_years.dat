40|$|The {{significance}} of the role women in development had been recognized {{by the government of}} India right from the first <b>five</b> <b>year</b> plan (1951 - 1956). However, women in these earlier plans were considered as subjects of ‘welfare’ and category of disadvantaged groups such as destitute, disabled, aged etc. As a category women had been gained special importance since the sixth <b>five</b> <b>year</b> plan. It is noteworthy that seventh and eighth <b>five</b> <b>year</b> have emphasized on ‘development’ and ‘empowerment’ respectively. With the passage of time, 11 th and 12 th <b>five</b> <b>year</b> plan have focused on inclusive growth. In other words, ‘women’ as a category must be included in the development process. Despite the various discrimination faced by women, the 12 th <b>five</b> <b>year</b> plan has emphasized on single women by providing ‘quota’ in jobs. Moreover, women’s inclusion in inclusive growth is only then possible when inclusive democracy turned to be reality not the myth.

Kishi's [...] "communistic" [...] <b>Five</b> <b>Year</b> Plan created much opposition from the zaibatsu, who were not keen to see his statist Manchurian system extended to Japan; not the least because in Kishi's system, the purpose of private enterprise was to serve the state rather than make a profit, and in December 1936 following an extensive lobbying campaign by the industrialists, the <b>Five</b> <b>Year</b> Plan was rejected by the Imperial Diet. However, the <b>Five</b> <b>Year</b> Plan, which rejected for Japan, went ahead in Manchukuo. The intention of the <b>Five</b> <b>Year</b> Plan was to focus on heavy industry for military purposes and to vastly increase production of coal, steel, electricity and weapons. One of the corporations founded for the <b>Five</b> <b>Year</b> Plan was the state-owned Manchurian Corporation for Development of Heavy Industry in 1937, which in its first year, had 5.2 billion yen invested in it by the Japanese state, making it by far the largest capital project in the Japanese empire; the total expenditure by the state for 1937 was 2.5 billion yen and for 1938 3.2 billion yen. The Japanese historian Hotta Eri wrote that never before in Japanese history had the state ever embarked upon such a gigantic project such as the <b>Five</b> <b>Year</b> Plan.|$|R
