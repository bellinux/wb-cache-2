40|$|This paper first {{addresses}} {{the significance of}} teaching Chinese students the use of <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> English oral communication and discusses the reasons why many Chinese students fail to show <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> their English speech. Then a two-stage procedure, based on the communicative approach, which involves students in recognizing and practicing the use of <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> oral communication is presented. This procedure starts from exploring the forms and meanings of <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> English, moving to communicative functions. More specifically, in the first stage, the salient physical features of focus and then the relationship between <b>focus</b> and meaning <b>in</b> communication are examined; in the second stage, a number of activities related to communicative functions are provided for students to use <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> contexts, so that students {{get a chance to}} apply what they have learned from the first stage. It is hoped that familiarizing students with focus will, therefore, not only offer them the necessary basis, but also enhance their sensitivity to the use of <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> oral communication...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hypoattenuated <b>foci</b> <b>in</b> the otic capsule are {{routinely}} identified on multidetector CT (MDCT), particularly in pediatric patients. We aimed {{to describe and}} characterize the hypoattenuated <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> the anterior otic capsule. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We first reviewed histologic sections {{of the temporal bone}} from 8 -month-old fetuses to determine the nature of the hypoattenuated <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> the anterior otic capsule. A cadaver collection of skull bases from fetuses and neonates (n 19), infants (n 24), and young children (n 23) were then studied with MDCT to determine the developmental evolution of this hypoattenuated <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> relation to the petrous apex. We specifically looked for the hypoattenuated <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> the anterior otic capsule, the development of the petrous apex, and the presence of other hypoattenuated <b>foci</b> <b>in</b> the fissula ante fenestram and middle otic layer. RESULTS: The hypoattenuated <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> the anterior otic capsule corresponded histologically to a cancellous bone trabecula emanating from the middle otic layer and directed toward the petro-occipital fissure. At this level it was covered with a cartilaginous cap. The hypoattenuated <b>focus</b> was observed <b>in</b> all of the fetuses and in all of the postnatal subjects younger than 4 months of age and was always associated with hypoattenuated foci of the middle otic layer and the fissula ante fenestram.

5|$|A {{few days}} after his arrival in Buenos Aires in the United Provinces (formally named the Argentine Republic in 1826), San Martín was interviewed by the First Triumvirate. They {{appointed}} him a lieutenant colonel of cavalry, {{and asked him to}} create a cavalry unit, as Buenos Aires did not have good cavalry. He began to organize the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers with Alvear and Zapiola. As Buenos Aires lacked professional military leaders, San Martín was entrusted with the protection of the whole city, but kept <b>focused</b> <b>in</b> the task of building the military unit.|$|E
5|$|After Romania {{joined the}} war {{on the side of}} the Triple Entente in August and was quickly overrun by the Central Powers, the Russian efforts in the Black Sea in the second half of 1916 were <b>focused</b> <b>in</b> the west. Because German {{submarines}} never really accomplished all that much in the Black Sea, the February 1917 resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare led the Germans to temporarily abandon the Black Sea in lieu of the more target-rich Mediterranean.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{acoustic}} realization of single vs. double <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> statements and yes/no questions in General American English. Four speakers produced {{four sets of}} utterances of different lengths with alternating focus and sentence type conditions. Results indicate that double focus increases max F 0 and duration of the focused word to a similar degree as single <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> both statements and yes/no questions. Furthermore, post-focus pitch range suppression occurs in both single- and double-focused statements. However, in yes/no questions, post-focus pitch range compression and raising occur only after single focus and focus 2 of double <b>focus.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, F 0 after focus 1 of double focus falls gradually until the stressed syllable <b>in</b> <b>focus</b> 2 <b>in</b> yes/no questions. These findings suggest that double focus interacts with sentence type in a more complicated way than single <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> shaping F 0 contours of English sentences...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} if hyperreflective <b>foci</b> <b>in</b> the outer retina {{are associated with}} photoreceptor integrity and the logarithm of minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity (VA) in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). : Retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study. : Patients (n = 76; 108 eyes) with clinically relevant macular edema and no serous retinal detachment were analyzed retrospectively.

These civic bands (banda communale) used instruments to perform operatic arias, with trombones or fluegelhorns for male vocal parts and cornets for female parts.|$|E

Nevertheless, other characters such as Terry and Andy Bogard became the ones who got the designers' utmost attention and were given new moves.|$|E

5|$|The {{beautiful}} nuthatch {{was first}} described in 1843 by British zoologist Edward Blyth, from a specimen he examined in Darjeeling. Its kinship {{with other members}} of the genus is unclear. The bright blue color of its plumage invites a comparison to the blue nuthatch (S. azurea), or other blue-tinted nuthatch species such as the velvet-fronted nuthatch (S. frontalis), yellow-billed nuthatch (S. solangiae) and the sulphur-billed nuthatch (S. oenochlamys), but its distribution being <b>focused</b> <b>in</b> the eastern Himalayas, and the uniqueness of its plumage, argues against the assumption.

5|$|Agrilus planipennis, {{commonly}} known as the emerald ash borer, is a green buprestid or jewel beetle native to northeastern Asia that feeds on ash species. Females lay eggs in bark crevices on ash trees, and larvae feed underneath the bark of ash trees to emerge as adults in one to two years. In its native range, it is typically found at low densities and does not cause significant damage to trees native to the area. Outside its native range, it is an invasive species and is highly destructive to ash trees native to northwest Europe and North America. Prior to being found in North America, very little was known about emerald ash borer in its native range; this has resulted in much of the research on its biology being <b>focused</b> <b>in</b> North America. Local governments in North America are attempting to control it by monitoring its spread, diversifying tree species, insecticides, and biological control.|$|E
