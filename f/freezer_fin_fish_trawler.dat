40|$|In {{this paper}} <b>fishing</b> <b>trawler</b> {{scheduling}} and production {{planning for a}} quota-based integrated commercial fishery is modelled mathematically. The catch capacity of <b>fishing</b> <b>trawlers</b> and the capacity of processing firms are two major factors which influence the scheduling of <b>fishing</b> <b>trawlers.</b> Production planning in fish processing firms depends on steady supply of fresh fish from the <b>fishing</b> <b>trawlers</b> to the processing firms. We develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to co-ordinate <b>trawler</b> scheduling, <b>fishing,</b> processing, and labour allocation of quota based integrated fisheries. We demonstrate the workability of our model with a numerical example and sensitivity analysis based on data obtained {{from one of the}} major fisheries in New Zealand...|$|R

Decision was made to convert <b>fishing</b> <b>trawlers</b> for this purpose, {{based on the fact that}} these <b>fishing</b> <b>trawlers</b> were successfully deployed in both coastal and littoral waters in fishing. A total of two were converted in the early 1960s, but based on the deployment experience, the result was far from satisfactory because these <b>fishing</b> <b>trawlers</b> are simply too small to carry out the required missions effectively. By 1990, both units were retired from service. Specification: ...|$|R

40|$|This paper models <b>fishing</b> <b>trawler</b> {{scheduling}} for integrated fisheries. <b>Fishing</b> <b>trawler</b> scheduling is a {{well known}} problem in the fishery industry. The scheduling problems faced by the fishery industry are more complicated than the traditional merchant trawler scheduling problems. The factors that influence the scheduling of <b>fishing</b> <b>trawlers</b> include catch capacity, processing capacity, etc. We develop a mix integer linear programming (MILP) model to schedule the trawlers of an integrated commercial fishery. We demonstrate our model with a numerical example. In our model we coordinate <b>trawler</b> scheduling, <b>fishing,</b> processing, labour allocation, and catch quota allocation of fisheries. Using rolling horizon approach, we update the model with new information and run every five periods, taking the current period as the initial period. ...|$|R
