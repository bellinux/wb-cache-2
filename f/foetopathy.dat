40|$|The {{parasite}} Neospora caninum is {{an important}} cause of abortion in cattle world-wide. Chronically infected dams transmit the parasite transplacentally and infected foetuses may be aborted or born chronically infected but clinically normal. Chronically infected cows repeatedly transmit the parasite to foetuses in several pregnancies and some may abort more than once suggesting that the immune response in these cattle is compromised during pregnancy. To investigate {{the nature of the}} immune response in chronically infected cattle, five naturally, chronically infected cows were challenged with N. caninum tachyzoites at 10 weeks of gestation. No <b>foetopathy</b> occurred and all five delivered live calves at full-term. In four naive pregnant cows challenged at the same time, all four foetuses died within 3 - 5 weeks of challenge. Of the five live calves born to the chronically infected challenged cows, three were transplacentally infected with N. caninum. The kinetics of the maternal anti-N. caninum antibody responses during gestation suggested that these transplacental infections were not the result of the superimposed challenge, but the result of the recrudescence of the maternal chronic infection-which occurred concurrently in non-challenged, chronically infected pregnant controls. These data provide the first experimental evidence that protective immunity occurs in neosporosis. They also suggest that whilst immunity to a pre-existing infection will protect against an exogenous challenge, this protective immunity will not prevent transplacental infection. This implies that a subtle form of concomitant immunity exists in chronically infected cattle and has important implications for vaccine development. (C) 2003 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

40|$|Many {{devices are}} {{available}} for atrial septal defect (ASD) usually in adults and children. We report here one center experience in transcatheter closure of ASD in infancy, using the Amplatzer septal occluder. From January 2003 to March 2010, 10 males and 5 female, mean age 10. 9 ± 6. 4 months, with weight 6. 7 ± 2. 5 kg underwent transcatheter closure of atrial septal defect. The patients had significant left-to-right shunting (n= 12), right-to-left shunting with hypoxemia (n= 3). For the left-to-right shunting, the ASD was closed for pulmonary hypertension (n= 10), for recurrent chest infection and bronchiolitis (n= 5). The ASD was associated with other congenital heart defect (n= 5), prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (n= 6), <b>foetopathy</b> (n= 1) and encephalopathy (n= 1). The ASD was evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography (TEE) before the procedure. Percutaneous closure was realized with TEE for all patients. They received intravenous heparin. For 4 patients implantation was performed after a balloon test occlusion (mean 11 ± 3. 4 mm diameter). The ASO device size was 10. 4 ± 3. 9 mm. The fluoroscopy time was 7. 9 ± 3. 9 minutes {{and the time of}} the procedure 55. 6 ± 21. 8 minutes. No per procedural complications were observed for all but for two (one anomalous device deployment and one insufficient rim). These two patients were subsequently surgically repaired. Patients left the hospital with a low dose of aspirin for 6 months. During follow-up, four patients had a minimal residual shunt on TEE performed up to one year after the implantation. No later cardiac complication was observed. To conclude, transcatheter closure of atrial septal defect in infant with the ASO is feasible and a possible alternative to surgical closure. In addition, ASD occlusion improves the respiratory status and reduces the level of pulmonary hypertension. Additional long-term results and a large study are both necessary to establish the future of this populatio...|$|E
