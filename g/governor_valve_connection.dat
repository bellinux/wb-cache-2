The original <b>governor</b> <b>valve</b> design had been used successfully {{for many years in}} large multistage, multivalve steam turbines, but apparently was not reliable at the high steam pressures employed today. Mechanical analyses, flow analyses, and testing showed that the failures were caused by flow-induced instability in the valve. Candidate valves with more stable flow fields were designed and tested. The final design combined features of two other, more typical designs, and showed good flow stability throughout the lift range. This new ?hybrid? valve has since been applied successfully in other turbines...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 89 The boiler {{feedwater}} {{system in}} a world scale ethylene plant utilized horizontal multistage barrel case pumps and single stage impulse type steam turbine drivers with mechanical governors. As part of a major debottlenecking project, they were rerated to provide more flow. The entire pump inner case assemblies (including rotor and inner casing) were replaced with higher capacity elements. The steam turbines had new <b>governor</b> <b>valves</b> and nozzle rings installed to produce more power. The control scheme was modernized with an electronic governor that adjusted the pump speed to maintain a constant header pressure. The new equipment was installed in September 1994, nothing went well. The pump experienced high blade pass frequency vibrations. The solution required unique hydraulic modifications and inboard bearing bracket stiffening to eliminate a resonance. The turbines tripped mysteriously and broke <b>governor</b> <b>valve</b> stems. The cause was a valve resonance problem that were teething problems with the electronic governor control system that took time to sort out. These problems became very high profile when the newly rerated boiler feedwater pumps tripped and caused a total plant shutdown resulting in a 14 hr flare. Not only was there a major financial impact from lost production, it also prompted the ministry of the Environment to initiate {{a review of the}} company?s entire flaring history. Although it took a difficult year of effort, the pumps and turbines are now operating satisfactorily. The problems discovered are discussed, along with the analysis performed and the solutions implemented...|$|R

50|$|The {{explosion}} {{occurred during}} a propane transfer from a Doxol railroad {{car to a}} storage tank on the Getz rail siding near Andy Devine Avenue/Route 66. The incident began when a railroad worker attempted to tighten a leaking connection by hitting a wrench with another wrench or a hammer; this caused a spark that ignited the leaking propane gas. The initial fire badly burned the two railroad employees present, one of whom later died from his burns. The burning propane gas escaping from the <b>valve</b> <b>connection</b> on the rail car quickly heated the liquid propane inside, increasing the tank pressure. This in turn increased the leak and fire, further heating the tank car.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Most of the {{industrial}} processes are multivariable in nature. Designing controller for the Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO) process is difficult because {{of the changes in}} process dynamics and interaction between process variables. The objective of the current study presented in this paper is to design a multivariable Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) Controller for a sample controlled hydropower system that comprises a hydraulic turbine driving a synchronous generator which is connected to an infinite bus via a step-up transformer and a transmission line. From the system point of view, a sample controlled hydropower system can be modelled as a two-input-two-output system, where the inputs are the exciter input voltage Ue and <b>governor</b> <b>valve</b> position Ug and the outputs are the active power Pt and the terminal voltage Vt. The validity and robustness of the proposed system is tested for reference tracking and disturbance rejection behaviour using simulation.

50|$|The {{single shaft}} five {{cylinder}} impulse-reaction turbine has a double flow arrangement for the I.P. cylinders {{as well as}} for the L.P. cylinders. There are double casings on H.P., I.P., and L.P. cylinders, and the last stages of the L.P. are fitted with 914.4 mm (36 in) blades. Stop <b>valves</b> and <b>governor</b> <b>valves</b> are situated at the inlet to the H.P. strainers and I.P. turbine. There are four 228.6 mm (9 in) bore main steam pipes, and four 431.8 mm (17 in) bore pipes on both the hot and cold reheat circuits to the turbine. In view of the size and increased volume of pipework compared to earlier designs, special attention was paid to mounting the valve chests as close to the machine as possible to reduce the stored energy effect of overspeed. For the H.P. valves this is done without actually mounting the valves on the cylinder, thus avoiding complication of the H.P. casing.|$|R
30|$|We have designed, built, {{and tested}} an {{automated}} three-reactor radiosynthesizer (ELIXYS) {{to provide a}} flexible radiosynthesis platform suitable for both tracer development and routine production. The synthesizer is capable of performing high-pressure and high-temperature reactions by eliminating permanent tubing and <b>valve</b> <b>connections</b> to the reaction vessel. Each of the three movable reactors can seal against different locations on disposable cassettes to carry out different functions such as sealed reactions, evaporations, and reagent addition. A reagent and gas handling robot moves sealed reagent vials from storage locations in the cassette to addition positions and also dynamically provides vacuum and inert gas to ports on the cassette. The software integrates these automated features into chemistry unit operations (e.g., React, Evaporate, Add) to intuitively create synthesis protocols. 2 -Deoxy- 2 -[18 F]fluoro- 5 -methyl-β-l-arabinofuranosyluracil (l-[18 F]FMAU) and 2 -deoxy- 2 -[18 F]fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (d-[18 F]FAC) were synthesized to validate the system.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{introduces}} a condition diagnosis technique for a turbine governor system. The governor system {{is an important}} control system to handle turbine speed in a nuclear power plant. The turbine governor system includes turbine valves and stop valves which have their own functions in the system. Because a turbine governor system is operated by high oil pressure, {{it is very difficult}} to maintain under stable operating conditions. Turbine valves supply oil pressure to the governor system for proper operation. Using the pressure variation of turbine and <b>governor</b> <b>valves,</b> operating conditions of the turbine governor control system are detected and identified. To achieve automatic detection of valve status, time-based and frequency-based analysis is employed. In this study, a new approach, wavelet decomposition, was used to extract specific features from the pressure signals of the <b>governor</b> and stop <b>valves.</b> The extracted features, which represent the operating conditions of the turbine governor system, include important information to control and diagnose the valves. After extracting the specific features, decision rules were used to classify the valve conditions. The rules were generated by a decision tree algorithm (a typical simple method for data-based rule generation). The results given by the wavelet-based analysis were compared to detection results using time- and frequency-based approaches. Compared with the several related studies, the wavelet transform-based analysis, the proposed in this study has the advantage of easier application without auxiliary features...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe crack repair {{technique}} by “crack grinding”, {{due to its}} efficiency, {{has been}} widely used to extend the service life of the cracked structural components. The “crack grinding” technique is carried out by removing the materials which contains the crack. So it is of great importance to {{study the effects of}} this repair technique. In this paper, the finite element method is used to analyse the behavior of repaired cracks in mode I by computing the stress-intensity factors at the crack tip. 3 D numerical simulation was carried out to model the steam <b>governor</b> <b>valve</b> in a coal-fired thermal power plant with a semi-elliptic crack. Since no extra auxiliary solutions are required for the computation, the proposed method appears to be visual and can be used for evaluation of the associated stress-intensity factors. The plot of the stress-intensity factors according to the crack length in mode I, shows that the stress-intensity factor exhibits an asymptotic behavior as the crack length increases. It's to be noted that a transition zone allows connecting the refined specific crack tip mesh to the global structural discretization. So this technique can be used for complex industrial structures...|$|R

A major task of the Phase- 1 commissioning was the vacuum scrubbing of new beam pipes in anticipation of a sufficiently long beam lifetime and low background noise in the next commissioning, prior to which a new particle detector will be installed. The pressure rise per unit beam current decreased steadily with increasing beam dose, as expected. Another important task was to check the stabilities of various new vacuum components at high beam currents of approximately 1  A. The temperature increases of the bellows chambers, gate <b>valves,</b> <b>connection</b> flanges, and so on were less than several degrees at 1  A, and no serious problems were found. The effectiveness of the antechambers and TiN coating in suppressing the electron-cloud effect (ECE) in the positron ring was also confirmed.

The use of permanent magnets to create an axial magnetic field of approximately 100  G successfully suppressed this effect.
