5|$|In 1946 {{while at}} Boston University, Massaquoi {{completed}} editing the autobiography (which was originally titled Bush to Boulevard: The Autobiography of a Vai Noblewoman).

5|$|Later in her tenure, she {{was honored}} by the United Nations, as the body named her honorary {{ambassador}} for the United Nations' Decade of Literacy. In this position, she announced that she would host a Conference on Global Literacy. The conference, held in September 2006, encouraged a constant effort to promote literacy and highlighted many successful literacy programs. She coordinated this {{as a result of}} <b>her</b> <b>many</b> trips abroad where she witnessed how literacy benefited children in poorer nations.|$|E
5|$|Olivia often visited <b>her</b> <b>many</b> Johnson {{relatives}} in the country, and became particularly fond of her cousin Lionel Johnson—the {{only one of many}} uncles and cousins not to join the military—who {{went on to become a}} poet and friend to W.

5|$|Following Romania's {{transition}} to a Socialist Republic, the monarchy was excoriated by communist officials. Several biographies {{of the royal family}} described Marie either as a drunkard or as a promiscuous woman, referring to <b>her</b> <b>many</b> alleged affairs and to orgies she had supposedly organised before and during the war. In the years preceding the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Marie's popularity recovered and she was offered as a model of patriotism to the population. Marie is primarily remembered for her work as a nurse, but is also known for her extensive writing, including her critically acclaimed autobiography.|$|E

5|$|Gianna Maria Canale {{took the}} female {{lead in the}} film despite not {{initially}} wanting the role. The film {{was the last of}} <b>her</b> <b>many</b> films she made with Freda.

5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} <b>her</b> <b>many</b> versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, the Methodist Church {{helped the}} merger of her school with the boys' Cookman Institute, forming the Bethune-Cookman College, a coeducational junior college. Bethune became president.

From 1936 to 1942, Bethune had to cut back her time as president because of her duties in Washington, DC. Funding declined {{during this period of}} her absence. But, by 1941 the college had developed a four-year curriculum and achieved full college status. By 1942 Bethune gave up the presidency, as her health was being adversely affected by <b>her</b> <b>many</b> responsibilities.|$|E

A year later {{she made her}} first {{appearance}} as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United States between 1948 and 1950 and <b>her</b> <b>many</b> visits to continental Europe.|$|E

In October 1918, Kichisaburō Nomura was appointed captain of Yakumo for two months, only one of which he spent on board the vessel, as a political appointment to qualify Nomura for flag rank.|$|E

Queen Victoria's passion for Pugs was passed on to many {{other members of the}} Royal family, including her grandson King George V and his son King Edward VIII. Many responded to the breed's image of anti-functionalism and diminutive size during this period.|$|E
5|$|Kajol {{made her}} acting debut {{at the age}} of {{seventeen}} in the 1992 romantic drama Bekhudi alongside debutante Kamal Sadanah and her mother Tanuja, who in the film also played her mother. Kajol played Radhika, a girl who falls in love with Sadanah's character despite her parents' wish for her to marry another man.
