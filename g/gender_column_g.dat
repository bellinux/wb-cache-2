40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of the research {{is to improve the}} seismic behaviour of a non-ductile column failing in a brittle shear using glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP). Two non-ductile columns with similar size, concrete and cross-sectional properties were tested under lateral cyclic loading. The first <b>column</b> (<b>G</b> 1) possesses longitudinal reinforcement ratio of 2. 76 % with 0. 25 x 0. 35 m in size and 1. 1 m in height. The minimum requirement for the amount of stirrup was used in these columns. For the second <b>column</b> (<b>G</b> 2), the <b>column</b> was wrapped by 3 -layer GFRP 500 mm from the base. When <b>column</b> <b>G</b> 1 was subjected to lateral cyclic loading, the column failed in shear at the lateral drift of 3. 5 %. For <b>column</b> <b>G</b> 2, the GFRP could increase column shear capacity and also confine the concrete in the plastic hinge region. Consequently, the column maximum displacement was dramatically increased up to 12 % drift and the column eventually failed in flexure mode associated with longitudinal reinforcement yielding, compression bar buckling and crushing of concrete inside the GFRP. It is evident that the GFRP could effectively improve the unfavourable column shear failure of non-ductile columns by increasing column shear strength and concrete ductility in the plastic hinge region...|$|R

A δ-modular code [15] is characterized {{as having a}} generator matrix where each <b>column</b> <b>g</b> appears with multiplicity δ|gR×| for some δ ∈ Q. Generalizing [10] and [5], we show that the additive group of a two-weight code satisfying certain constraint equations (and in particular a modular code) has a strongly regular Cayley graph and derive existence conditions on its parameters. We provide a construction for an infinite family of modular two-weight codes arising from unions of submodules with pairwise trivial intersection.

40|$|Abstract – Shoulder {{movements}} are a complex motor act, controlled by many muscles {{attached to the}} scapula and the vertebral column. These muscles are innervating by motoneurons (Mns) located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Motoneurons of the ventral horn are arranged such that several groups of Mns can be distinguished in a transverse section through the spinal cord. The anatomical or functional implication of these groups is still unknown. The present research was designed to determine the location and topographical mapping of Mns to the rat serratus anterior (SA) muscle. Thirty young adult male rats weighing 180 - 250 g were used in this study. The location and distribution of the Mns in the rat cervical spinal cord to the serratus anterior (SA) muscle of the rat have been studied using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) intramuscular injection {{and the application of}} a HRP nerve dipping method to the long thoracic nerve. Following the intramuscular injection of HRP and also a nerve dipping for the long thoracic nerve, labeled motoneurons were identified ipsilaterally to the side of HRP application forming two main cell columns extended rostrocaudally in the ventral horn of both sides.

30|$|Tables  13 and 14 contain {{estimates}} of Eq. (4), stratified by traditional and non-traditional immigrants, {{for males and}} females, respectively. Separate estimates, based on potential and actual measures of experience, are also reported. Consistent with the Canadian literature, foreign experience is virtually worthless regardless of an immigrant’s source country or <b>gender</b> (<b>columns</b> 1, row 6) 25. The return to a year of foreign schooling is also discounted but to a much lesser extent for males than females (columns 1, rows 4, 7). These findings are consistent to Census estimates from Pendakur and Pendakur (1998), who show there is a sizable earnings disadvantage for female immigrants with foreign education from Asia or Africa, but not for male immigrants from these same regions. Similar returns to foreign education based on SLID data are also reported by Skuterud and Su (2012). Similarly, Alboim et al. (2005) using the Survey of Literacy Skills find high returns to foreign education, and Buzdugan and Halli (2009) using the Ethnic Diversity Survey reveal that for recent arrivals, discounted foreign experience {{is the driving force}} behind immigrant-wage disadvantages regardless of the origin of education. Taken as a whole, the main culprit behind immigrant-native wage gaps is the complete lack of return to foreign experience.|$|R
