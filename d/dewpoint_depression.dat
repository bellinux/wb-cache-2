In the mountainous terrain of the western United States and Mexican Plateau, the 850 hPa pressure surface can be a more realistic depiction of the weather pattern than a standard surface analysis. Using the 850 and 700 hPa pressure surfaces, one can determine when and where warm advection (coincident with upward vertical motion) and cold advection (coincident with downward vertical motion) is occurring within the lower portions of the troposphere. Areas with small <b>dewpoint</b> <b>depressions</b> and are below freezing indicate the presence of icing conditions for aircraft.

50|$|After the {{secondary}} eyewall totally surrounds the inner eyewall, {{it begins to}} affect the tropical cyclone dynamics. Hurricanes are fueled by the high ocean temperature. Sea surface temperatures immediately underneath a tropical cyclone can be several degrees cooler than those at the periphery of a storm, and therefore cyclones are dependent upon receiving the energy from the ocean from the inward spiraling winds. When an outer eyewall is formed, the moisture and angular momentum necessary {{for the maintenance of}} the inner eyewall is now being used to sustain the outer eyewall, causing the inner eye to weaken and dissipate leaving the tropical cyclone with one eye that is larger in diameter than the previous eye.In the moat region between the inner and outer eyewall, observations by dropsondes have shown high temperatures and <b>dewpoint</b> <b>depressions.</b> The eyewall contracts because of inertial instability.

Maps from the two climatologies are found to be very similar for most of North America. The largest differences appear along the eastern coastline and in regions of large elevation gradients, where the orography in the 32 -km climatology is better resolved than that of the 2. 5 ° climatology.

40|$|Hurricane Claudette {{developed}} from a weak vortex in 6 h as deep convection shifted from downshear into the vortex center, despite ambient vertical wind shear exceeding 10 m/s. Six hours later it weakened to a tropical storm, and 12 h {{after the hurricane}} stage a circulation center {{could not be found}} at 850 hPa by aircraft reconnaissance. At hurricane strength the vortex contained classic structure seen in intensifying hurricanes, with the exception of 7 - 12 C <b>dewpoint</b> <b>depressions</b> in the lower troposphere upshear of the center. These extended from the 100 -km radius to immediately adjacent to the eyewall, where equivalent potential temperature gradients reached 6 K/km. The dry air was not present prior to intensification, suggesting that it was associated with vertical shear-induced subsidence upshear of the developing storm. It is argued that weakening of the vortex was driven by cooling associated with the mixing of dry air into the core, and subsequent evaporation and cold downdrafts. Evidence suggests that this mixing might have been enhanced by eyewall instabilities after the period of rapid deepening. The existence of a fragile, small, but genuinely hurricane-strength vortex at the surface for 6 h presents difficult problems for forecasters.

40|$|Lightning is {{the primary}} cause of fire in the forested regions of the Pacific Northwest, {{especially}} when it occurs without significant precipitation at the surface. Using thunderstorm occurrence and precipitation observations for the period 1948 – 77, along with automated lightning strike data for the period 1986 – 96, it was possible to classify convective days as either ‘‘dry’ ’ or ‘‘wet’ ’ for several stations in the Pacific Northwest. Based on the classification, a discriminant analysis was performed on coincident upper-air sounding data from Spokane, Washington. It was found that a discriminant rule using the <b>dewpoint</b> <b>depression</b> at 85 kPa and the temperature difference between 85 and 50 kPa was able to classify correctly between 56 % and 80 % of the convective days as dry or wet. Also, composite maps of upper-air data showed distinctly different synoptic patterns among dry days, wet days, and all days. These findings potentially can be used by resource managers to gain a greater understanding of the atmospheric conditions that are conducive to lightning-induced fires in the Pacific Northwest. 1...|$|E
40|$|Using an {{approach}} {{similar to the}} biological processes of natural selection and evolution, the genetic algorithm (GA) is a nonconventional optimum search technique.

The problem involves finding optimum classification based on known data, training the future prediction system and then making reliable predictions for rainfall occurrences which have significance in agricultural, transportation, water resources and tourism activities.

The GAs do not require any of these assumptions in their applications.

40|$|Through {{examination}} of two successive weather systems off the California coast in mid-April 1999, {{we have shown}} {{the influence of the}} large-scale lower-tropospheric circulation pattern on surface trajectories and structure of the MBL. In subsequent discussion, we refer to the cyclone/anticyclone couplet that impacted the coast on April 7 - 12, 1999, as system 1, and the couplet that impacted the coast on April 12 - 16, 1999 as system 2. In system 1 that was fog free, measurements at the buoy sites showed that both air temperature and dewpoint temperature increased along the trajectories. The trajectories were governed by flow out of an anticyclone positioned offshore. Since sea surface temperature (SST) was generally larger than air temperature along these trajectories, the increase in both air temperature and moisture content could be attributed to the sensible and latent heat flux from sea to air. Subsidence was weak in system 1, cloud cover was limited to stratocumulus, and the MBL height remained relatively constant at about 800 – 1000 m. Nevertheless, the modification of the air {{in the aftermath of the}} frontal passage led to an airmass along the southern California coast that could be characterized as relatively warm and moist (air temperature nearly equal to the SST and <b>dewpoint</b> <b>depressions</b> of a few degrees Celsius). This air was entrained into synoptic system 2.

40|$|In intense {{tropical}} cyclones, {{sea level}} pressures {{at the center}} are 50 – 100 hPa lower than outside the vortex, but only 10 – 30 hPa of the total pressure fall occurs inside the eye between the eyewall and the center. Warming by dry subsidence accounts for this {{fraction of the total}} hydrostatic pressure fall. Convection in the eyewall causes the warming by doing work on the eye to force the thermally indirect subsidence. Soundings inside hurricane eyes show warm and dry air aloft, separated by an inversion from cloudy air below. <b>Dewpoint</b> <b>depressions</b> at the inversion level, typically 850 – 500 hPa, are 10 – 30 K rather than the; 100 K that would occur if the air descended from tropopause level without dilution by the surrounding cloud. The observed temperature and dewpoint distribution above the inversion can, however, be derived by; 100 hPa of undilute dry subsidence from an initial sounding that is somewhat more stable than a moist adiabat. It is hypothesized that the air above the inversion has remained in the eye since it was enclosed when the eyewall formed and that it has subsided at most a few kilometers. The cause of the subsidence is the enclosed air’s being drawn downward toward the inversion level as the air below it flows outward into the eyewall. Shrinkage of the eye’s volume is more than adequate to supply the volume lost as dry air is incorporated into the eyewall or converted to moist air by turbulent mixing across the eye boundary. The moist air below the inversion is in thermodynamic contact with the sea surface. Its moisture derives from evaporation of seawater inside the eye, frictional inflow of moist air under the eyewall, and from moist downdrafts induced as condensate mixes into the eye. The moist air’s residence time in the eye is much shorter than that of the dry air above the inversion. The height of the inversion is determined by the balance between evaporation, inflow, and inward mixing on one hand and loss to the eyewall updrafts on the other. 1...|$|R
40|$|Limited {{research}} exists concerning flash {{flooding in}} the United States. However, flash floods can occur anywhere and cause more fatalities {{than any other}} weather related natural disaster. Eastern Kentucky experienced an average of 41 flash floods per year (1993 - 2002), yet little research exists for this region. Therefore, this paper presents {{an analysis of the}} particularly devastating flash flood event of 3 - 4 August 2001, which resulted in 15 million worth of property damage and two deaths. Previous studies indicate that flash floods typically occur under relatively 2 ̆ 7 benign 2 ̆ 7 conditions, the most common characteristics being a quasi-stationary system and high atmospheric moisture. The slow moving nature of these systems, coupled with low <b>dewpoint</b> <b>depressions,</b> leads to the overabundance of precipitation that produces flash floods. Unfortunately, this relatively 2 ̆ 7 benign 2 ̆ 7 nature of weather systems poses a challenge for accurate forecasting of flash flooding. Furthermore, severe weather threats, such as tornadoes, tend to overshadow the threats posed by flash flooding, sometimes interfering with the timely issuance of flash flood warnings. To improve the accuracy of flash flood forecasting, several methods have been developed. For instance, lightning strike density helps forecasters in the West to locate regions more likely to receive the heavy rains necessary for flash flooding. Numerical forecasting models also help forecasters, especially when necessary data does not exist for the forecast area. One such model is the Penn State/ NCAR Mesoscale Model MM 5. This model consists of several options allowing for variations in climate and terrain. MM 5 was used to simulate the 3 - 4 August 2001 flash flood event, since upper air data does not exist for Eastern Kentucky. The model used for this paper utilized the Grell parameterization scheme, which provided better results than the other parameterization schemes tested (Kain-Fritsch). The Eastern Kentucky flash flood event, like the majority of other flash flood events throughout the Contiguous United States, did in fact occur under relatively benign conditions. This event occurred as heavy rains fell ahead of a trough axis associated with a slow-moving cold front. As the west-east oriented front moved southward, it stalled along the Appalachians and pivoted, becoming southwest-northeast oriented. High atmospheric moisture existed from the surface through 500 -mb ahead of the front. The winds were weak and from a northerly direction, while the stability indices indicated marginal instability throughout the event. About half of the flash floods reported during this event occurred prior to the issuance of a flash flood warning, while no record of a flash flood watch existed for any of the counties prior to flash flooding. Accurate forecasting of flash floods during this relatively benign event was further hindered by the lack of a flash flood climatology for the region...|$|R
40|$|Research {{examining}} {{associations between}} weather {{and human health}} frequently includes the effects of atmospheric humidity. A large number of humidity variables {{have been developed for}} numerous purposes, but little guidance is available to health researchers regarding appropriate variable selection. We examine a suite of commonly used humidity variables and summarize both the medical and biometeorological literature on associations between humidity and human health. As an example of the importance of humidity variable selection, we correlate numerous hourly humidity variables to daily respiratory syncytial virus isolates in Singapore from 1992 to 1994. Most water-vapor mass based variables (specific humidity, absolute humidity, mixing ratio, dewpoint temperature, vapor pressure) exhibit comparable correlations. Variables that include a thermal component (relative humidity, <b>dewpoint</b> <b>depression,</b> saturation vapor pressure) exhibit strong diurnality and seasonality. Humidity variable selection must be dictated by the underlying research question. Despite being the most commonly used humidity variable, relative humidity should be used sparingly and avoided in cases when the proximity to saturation is not medically relevant. Care must be taken in averaging certain humidity variables daily or seasonally to avoid statistical biasing associated with variables that are inherently diurnal through their relationship to temperature...|$|E

After sunrise, the basin atmosphere remoistened as higher humidity was brought down into the basin from above and as evapotranspiration occurred from the basin floor and sidewalls. The latent heat released at night by the dewfall/frostfall was 33 %– 53 % of the overall observed basin sensible heat loss, illustrating {{the important role of}} dew and frost formation on the nighttime heat budget of the basin atmosphere. An energy budget equation illustrates the decreasing importance of the latent heat release on the overall basin heat budget as ambient temperatures fall from summer to winter.

A sensitivity study is undertaken to assess how the representation of the urban area of London in the model, with a horizontal grid resolution of 1 km, affects its performance characteristics for the near-surface air temperature, <b>dewpoint</b> <b>depression,</b> and wind fields. No single simulation is found to provide the overall best or worst performance for all the near-surface fields considered. Using a multilayer (rather than single layer or bulk) urban canopy model does not clearly improve the prediction of the intensity of the UHI but it does improve the prediction of its spatial pattern. Providing surface-cover fractions leads to improved predictions of the UHI intensity. The advection of cooler air from the North Sea reduces the intensity of the UHI in the windward suburbs and displaces it several kilometres to the west, in good agreement with observations. Frontal advection across London effectively replaces the air in the urban area. Results indicate that there is a delicate balance between the effects of thermal advection and urbanization on near-surface fields, which depend, inter alia, on the parametrization of the urban canopy and the urban land-cover distribution...|$|E

Rawinsonde observations are employed to determine the locations of cloud-layer top and base by testing for <b>dewpoint</b> temperature <b>depressions</b> below some threshold value. Surface observations serve as quality checks on the rawinsonde-determined cloud properties and provide cloud amount and cloud-type information. The dataset provides layer-cloud amount, cloud type, high, middle, or low height classes, cloud-top heights, base heights and {{layer thicknesses}}, covering a range of latitudes from 0 deg to 80 deg N. All data comes from land sites: 34 are located in continental interiors, 14 are near coasts, and 15 are on islands. The uncertainties in the derived cloud properties are discussed. For clouds classified by low-, mid-, and high-top altitudes, there are strong latitudinal and seasonal variations in the layer thickness only for high clouds. High-cloud layer thickness increases with latitude and exhibits different seasonal variations in different latitude zones: in summer, high-cloud layer thickness is a maximum in the Tropics but a minimum at high latitudes. For clouds classified into three types by base altitude or into six standard morphological types, latitudinal and seasonal variations in layer thickness are very small. The thickness of the clear surface layer decreases with latitude and reaches a summer minimum in the Tropics and summer maximum at higher latitudes over land, but does not vary much over the ocean. Tropical clouds occur in three base-altitude groups and the layer thickness of each group increases linearly with top altitude. Extratropical clouds exhibit two groups, one with layer thickness proportional to their cloud-top altitude and one with small (less {{than or equal to}} 1000 m) layer thickness independent of cloud-top altitude...|$|R

That is to say, there could be multiple sets of predictors that give similar daily rainfall simulation results for both calibration and validation periods, but project different amounts (or even directions of change) of rainfall changing in the future. Results indicated that two sets of predictors (Set 1 with predictors of sea level pressure north-south gradient, u-wind at 700 hPa, v-wind at 700 hPa, and specific humidity at 700 hPa and Set 2 with predictors of sea level pressure north-south gradient, u-wind at 700 hPa, v-wind at 700 hPa, and <b>dewpoint</b> temperature <b>depression</b> at 850 hPa) as inputs to the NHMM produced satisfactory results of seasonal rainfall in comparison with observations. For example, during the model calibration period, the relative errors across the 38 catchments ranged from 0. 48 to 1. 76 % with a mean value of 1. 09 % for the predictor Set 1, and from 0. 22 to 2. 24 % with a mean value of 1. 16 % for the predictor Set 2. However, the changes of future rainfall from NHMM projections based on 19 GCMs produced projections with a different sign for these two different sets of predictors: Set 1 predictors project an increase of future rainfall with magnitudes depending on future time periods and emission scenarios, but Set 2 predictors project a decline of future rainfall. Such divergent projections may present a significant challenge for applications of statistical downscaling as well as climate change impact studies, and could potentially imply caveats in many existing studies in the literature...|$|R

IGRA consists of radiosonde and pilot balloon observations at more than 1500 globally distributed stations with varying periods of record, many of which extend from the 1960 s to present. Observations include pressure, temperature, geopotential height, <b>dewpoint</b> <b>depression,</b> wind direction, and wind speed at standard, surface, tropopause, and signifi-cant levels. IGRA contains quality-assured data from 11 different sources. Rigorous procedures are employed to ensure proper station identification, eliminate duplicate levels within soundings, and select one sounding for every station, date, and time. The quality assurance algorithms check for format problems, physically implausible values, internal inconsistencies among variables, runs of values across soundings and levels, climatological outliers, and temporal and vertical inconsistencies in temperature. The performance of the various checks was evaluated by careful inspection of selected soundings and time series. In its final form, IGRA is {{the largest and most}} comprehensive dataset of quality-assured radiosonde observations freely available.

Instrumentation deployed during the field phase of IPEX sampled a strong cold front and associated convection that moved through northern Utah on 14 – 15 February 2000. The surface cold front was characterized by a sharp temperature drop (88 C in 8 min), strong pressure rise (3 hPa in 30 min), and gusts to 40 m s 21. The temperature drop at high-elevation surface stations (2500 – 3000 m MSL) preceded the temperature drop at low-elevation surface stations (1290 – 2000 m MSL) {{by as much as}} an hour, implying a forward- or downshear-tilting frontal structure. Consistent with the cooling aloft, a hydrostatic pressure rise and wind shift preceded the temperature drop at the surface. Radar captured the rapid evolution of the wind shift line into a gravity current. A forward-sloping cloud with mammatus and a 20 -hPa-deep superadiabatic layer underneath were observed by radar and radiosondes, respectively. Shading from this forward-sloping cloud is believed to have produced a surface-based prefrontal inversion upon which a solitary gravity wave traveled. These and other observations reveal that the forward-sloping cloud generated by a shortwave trough aloft was producing precipitation that sublimated, melted, and evaporated in the dry subcloud air (<b>dewpoint</b> <b>depression</b> of 58 – 108 C), causing the cooling aloft and the nonclassical frontal structure...|$|E
40|$|Summer is a {{dry season}} in {{northern}} Taiwan. By contrast, the Taipei basin, located in this region, has its maximum rainfall during summer (15 June– 31 August), when 78 % of this rainfall is contributed by afternoon thunderstorms. This thunderstorm activity occurs during only 20 days in summer. Because of the pronounced {{impacts on the}} well-being of three {{million people in the}} basin and the relative infrequency of occurrence, forecasting thunderstorm events is an important operational issue in the Taipei basin. The basin’s small size (30 km × 60 km), with two river exits and limited thunderstorm occurrence days, makes the development of a thunderstorm activity forecast model for this basin a great challenge. Synoptic analysis reveals a thunderstorm day may develop from morning synoptic conditions free of clouds/rain, with a NW–SE-oriented dipole located south of Taiwan and southwesterlies straddling the low and high of this dipole. The surface meteorological conditions along the two river valleys exhibit distinct diurnal variations of pressure, temperature, <b>dewpoint</b> <b>depression,</b> relative humidity, and land–sea breezes. The primary features of the synoptic conditions and timings of the diurnal cycles for the four surface variables are utilized to develop a two-step hybrid forecast advisory for thunderstorm occurrence. Step 1 validates the 24 -h forecasts for the 0000 UTC (0800 LST) synoptic conditions and timings for diurnal variations for the first five surface variables on thunderstorm days. Step 2 validates the same synoptic and surface meteorological conditions (including sea-breeze onset time) observed on the thunderstorm day.

40|$|Ensemble {{forecasts}} aim {{to improve}} decision-making by predicting {{a set of}} possible outcomes. Ideally, these would provide probabilities which are both sharp and reliable. In practice, the models, data assimilation and ensemble perturbation systems are all imperfect, leading to deficiencies in the predicted probabilities. This paper presents an ensemble post-processing scheme which directly targets local reliability, calibrating both climatology and ensemble dispersion in one coherent operation. It makes minimal assumptions about the underlying statistical distributions, aiming to extract {{as much information as}} possible from the original dynamic forecasts and support statistically awkward variables such as precipitation. The output is a set of ensemble members preserving the spatial, temporal and inter-variable structure from the raw forecasts, which should be beneficial to downstream applications such as hydrological models. The calibration is tested on three leading 15 -d ensemble systems, and their aggregation into a simple multimodel ensemble. Results are presented for 12 h, 1 ° scale over Europe for a range of surface variables, including precipitation. The scheme is very effective at removing unreliability from the raw forecasts, whilst generally preserving or improving statistical resolution. In most cases, these benefits extend to the rarest events at each location within the 2 -yr verification period. The reliability and resolution are generally equivalent or superior to those achieved using a Local Quantile-Quantile Transform, an established calibration method which generalises bias correction. The value of preserving spatial structure is demonstrated by the fact that 3 × 3 averages derived from grid-scale precipitation calibration perform almost as well as direct calibration at 3 × 3 scale, and much better than a similar test neglecting the spatial relationships. Some remaining issues are discussed regarding the finite size of the output ensemble, variables such as sea-level pressure which are very reliable to start with, {{and the best way to}} handle derived variables such as <b>dewpoint</b> <b>depression...</b>|$|E

Cases are chosen {{on the basis}} of an upper trough being present over southern Africa, and a minimum horizontal and vertical temperature change. Wet and dry troughs are differentiated by the extent and amount of interior rainfall produced. Once selected, a spatial and temporal framework was used on surface, upper-level synoptic maps and radiosonde sections. Individual and composite time-height and spatial sections are analysed for anomalies of temperature, geopotentials, kinematic, vorticity and divergence fields, dewpoint, <b>dewpoint</b> <b>depression,</b> mixing ratio, dry and total static energy and, equivalent potential temperature. European Centre for Medium Range Forecast (ECMWF) maps of vertical motion are analysed and ECMWF data were exclusively used in the wet and dry case study. The essential features of wet troughs include a large amplitude upper westerly wave with a diffluent and northward displaced sub-tropical jet stream, slow movement, westward tilted trough in the vertical and a negative - positive dipole where a high is located south of the low pressure system. In comparison dry troughs are characterised by a small amplitude upper wave, rapid movement, no tilted trough in the vertical, and a stationary high-pressure system over the western interior. Radiosonde moisture variables, circulation anomalies and ECMWF fields of moisture flux give evidence in the wet cases of inflow from the north-east, in conjunction with a ridging anticyclone south of the continent. In dry cases the trajectory of flow is north-westerly and the supply of moisture is limited. In the ECMWF composite maps of vertical motion, lift is weak over the interior in dry cases consistent with a gentle slope in the divergence profile. For wet cases upward motions are intense and widespread over the interior consistent with a steep slope in the divergence profile, and compensated by descending motions over the adjacent oceans along 30 ° S band. Precipitation in wet events is a combination of dynamical forcing, prefrontal moisture and unstable lower troposphere. In dry events, precursor moist inflow is limited, weak instability and, a gentle slope in the divergence/convergence fields are not conducive to sustain lift...|$|E

However, their use has been hampered by ubiquitous and large discontinuities resulting from changes to instrumentation and observing practices. Here {{a new approach}} is developed to homogenize historical records of tropospheric (up to 100 hPa) <b>dewpoint</b> <b>depression</b> (DPD), the archived radiosonde humidity parameter. Two statistical tests are used to detect changepoints, which aremost apparent in histograms and occurrence frequencies of the daily DPD: {{a variant of the}} Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) test for changes in distributions and the penalized maximal F test (PMFred) for mean shifts in the occurrence frequency for different bins of DPD. These tests capture most of the apparent discontinuities in the daily DPD data, with an average of 8. 6 changepoints (; 1 changepoint per 5 yr) in each of the analyzed radiosonde records, which begin as early as the 1950 s and ended in March 2009. Before applying breakpoint adjustments, artificial sampling effects are first adjusted by estimating missingDPDreports for cold (T, 2308 C) and dry (DPDartificially set to 308 C) conditions using empirical relationships at each station between the anomalies of air temperature and vapor pressure derived from recent observations when DPD reports are available under these conditions. Next, the samplingadjusted DPD is detrended separately for each of the 4 – 10 quantile categories and then adjusted using a quantile-matching algorithm so that the earlier segments have histograms comparable to that of the latest segment. Neither the changepoint detection nor the adjustment uses a reference series given the stability of the DPD series. Using this new approach, a homogenized global, twice-dailyDPDdataset (available online at www. cgd. ucar. edu/cas/catalog/) is created for climate and other applications based on the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA) and two other data sources. The adjusted-daily DPD has much smaller and spatially more coherent trends during 1973 – 2008 than the raw data. It implies only small changes in relative humidity in the lower and middle troposphere. When combined with homogenized radiosonde temperature, other atmospheric humidity variables can be calculated, and these exhibit spatially more coherent trends than without the DPD homogenization. The DPD adjustment yields a different pattern of change in humidity parameters compared to the apparent trends from the raw data. The adjusted estimates show an increase in troposphericwater vapor globally...|$|E

A lightning climatology within 50 km of nine outdoor venue locations for the 1996 Summer Olympics is produced. Spatial and temporal patterns were analyzed for July and August from 1986 to 1993. Active and inactive lightning days were isolated and thermodynamic parameters examined. Logistic regression routines were developed using the aforementioned parameters to differentiate active days from inactive days. A linear regression routine was developed to predict the lightning flash category within 50 km of Athens, Georgia based on the thermodynamic variables. At the inland locations, no pattern was found in the spatial distribution of cloud-to-ground lightning: the strike locations were random. At the coastal location, an inland maximum in ground flash density was observed. The patterns of ground flash density exhibited large year to year variability. Although there was great day to day variability, there was a diurnal progression of lightning with a broad minimum from 0600 UTC to 1400 UTC and a sharp maximum near 2200 UTC. Composite synoptic charts were produced for eight selected active days and eight selected inactive days. At the 500 hPa level the composited <b>dewpoint</b> <b>depression</b> was approximately 8 C less on active days than on inactive days. At the 850 hPa level the vector averaged windfields on active days revealed weakly anticyclonic southwesterly flow throughout Georgia. On inactive days the vector averaged winds exhibited a large anticyclone centered in northern Georgia.

A lightning climatology within 50 km of nine outdoor venue locations for the 1996 Summer Olympics has been produced. Spatial and temporal patterns were analyzed for July and August from 1986 through 1993. Unusually active and inactive lightning days were isolated, and thermodynamic variables examined. At the inland sites, no pattern was found in the spatial distribution of cloud-to-ground lightning; that is, the lightning locations were random. At the one coastal site, Savannah, an inland maximum in ground flash density was observed. Although there was great day-to-day variability, there was a diurnal progression of lightning with a broad minimum from 0600 to 1400 UTC and a sharp maximum near 2200 UTC. Composite synoptic charts were produced for eight selected active days and eight selected inactive days. At the 500 -hPa level the composite <b>dewpoint</b> <b>depression</b> in central Georgia was approximately 8 ?C less on active days than on inactive days. At the 850 -hPa level the vector-averaged wind fields on active days revealed weakly anticyclonic southwesterly flow throughout Georgia. On inactive days, the vector-averaged winds exhibited a large anticyclone centered in northern Georgia. Some correlation was found between cloud-to-ground lightning activity and several of the thermodynamic variables. The most highly correlated was a form of convective available potential energy with a correlation coefficient of 0. 70. The Showalter stability index and K index had correlation coefficients of 0. 60 and 0. 56, respectively. Logistic regression equations were developed to forecast active and inactive lightning days from thermodynamic variables and persistence. Days of unusually low lightning activity were more accurately identified through logistic regression than days of unusually high lightning activity. To aid in forecasting lightning days, the historical probability of active or inactive lightning days is provided {{as a function of the}} logistic model output.
