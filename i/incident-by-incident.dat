5000|$|An {{aspect of}} {{wildfire}} policy that is gaining attention is the wildland-urban interface (WUI). More {{and more people}} are living in [...] "red zones," [...] or areas that are at high risk of wildfires. FEMA and the NFPA develop specific policies to guide homeowners and builders in how to build and maintain structures at the WUI and how protect against property losses. For example, NFPA-1141 is a standard for fire protection infrastructure for land development in wildland, rural and suburban areas and NFPA-1144 is a standard for reducing structure ignition hazards from wildland fire. For a full list of these policies and guidelines, see http://www.nfpa.org/categoryList.asp?categoryID=124&URL=Codes%20&%20Standards. Compensation for losses in the WUI are typically negotiated on an <b>incident-by-incident</b> basis. This is generating discussion about the burden of responsibility for funding and fighting a fire in the WUI, in that, if a resident chooses to live in a known red zone, should he or she retain a higher level of responsibility for funding home protection against wildfires. One initiative aimed at helping U.S. WUI communities live more safely with fire is called fire-adapted communities.|$|E
30|$|The {{inductive}} analytical {{strategies of}} this study align with those of constructed grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006). More specifically, data analysis began {{with a series of}} open/initial, <b>incident-by-incident</b> coding (Bazeley and Jackson, 2013; Glaser and Straus, 1967; Patton, 2002) of the study’s two primary data sources: TDT conversations and individual interviews.|$|E

The primary aims of PSH are to assist tenants with maintaining residential stability and increasing independence. Such services {{are particularly important}} for people with serious mental illness (SMI) because they have complex daily living needs and face personal and contextual barriers to community living. 1 While research shows that PSH programs benefit both individuals and communities, 2 programs vary {{in their ability to}} address tenant needs. This poster communicates a community-engaged research project in a Southeastern Michigan PSH community. 3 During initial project conversations, the program administrator stated a desire to move beyond “maintaining housing” and “averting crises” to addressing broader tenant health and wellness issues and supporting “flourishing” in daily life. The fit between the agency’s needs and the focus of the researcher’s home discipline (i. e., occupational science) provided a fruitful opportunity for designing an exploratory qualitative study. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a nuanced understanding of tenant health and wellness as a starting point for intervention development and service enhancement. This research draws upon ethnographic methods and constructivist grounded theory analytic strategies. 4 Participant recruitment began in May 2012 with agency collaborators identifying initial participants. As the study progressed, additional participants were recruited based on participant suggestions. To date, 17 participants are enrolled in the study, including tenants (n= 9), PSH program support staff (n= 7), and PSH administrators (n= 1). Data were generated at multiple sites (i. e., apartment complexes, private residences) through the use of homogenous focus groups, individual interviews and participant observations. The analytic process used line-by-line, <b>incident-by-incident,</b> and focused coding to identify (a) convergent and divergent perspectives on health as wellness, and (b) barriers to health and wellness. The next phase of the study, which aims to elaborate and refine analytic categories and understandings, will involve participants from the property management company and additional PSH program tenants. The preliminary findings of this study contribute to the occupational science discourse on occupational justice 5 for adults with SMI. Four findings emphasize the centrality of opportunity and control in lifestyle-based wellness intervention. First, tenants and staff had divergent views on what living well entailed in particular situations. Second, for both tenants and staff, it was often impractical to attend to health and wellness beyond shelter, medication, sustenance, and basic activities of daily living. Third, staff members’ mediation between tenants and property managers created a boundary that undermined wellness. Fourth, limiting services to those deemed medically necessary created an inability to provide certain supports. These circumstances highlight the need for transformative social changes that shift wellness interventions past the individual level to the organizational plane. Occupational science has a key role to play in challenging the injustices associated with exclusion from daily occupations and advocating for system change strategies that support participation.
