Sandwich Plate System (SPS) Floors deliver a compelling off-site solution <b>for</b> <b>structural</b> <b>floors.</b> Their composite steel panels provide a similar performance to concrete floors at one quarter the weight, 10 - 15 % shorter project schedules and broader benefits such as reduced complexity and the elimination of the majority of wet-work above ground level...|$|R

The shell is first placed in its historical context. The writer then proposes the application of shells for floors through rationale based on three points: (1) historical precedent; (2) structural capability; (3) aesthetic qualities. The application having been proposed, the writer then proceeds {{to an analysis of}} the problem - from the simplest stages to the more complex applications. The specific criteria which are the basis of the application of shallow shells for floors follow the analysis. The last part is a demonstration of several prototype systems of shells for floors...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{is a part}} of the development to employ a lightweight composite panel system known as profiled steel sheet medium density fiberboard (PSSMDFB), as an innovation <b>for</b> <b>structural</b> <b>floor</b> building. PSSMDF panel are formed from a combination of two main components, namely profiled steel sheet and medium density fiberboard attached by mechanical connectors, i. e. self drilling screw. The objective of this {{research is}} to predict the deflection behaviour of the PSSMDF composite floor panel system. A theoretical model has yielded deflection result within 12 % accuracy compared to experimental value obtained in the laboratory. Through theoritical model it can be predicted the behaviour of the PSSMDF floor on the composite partial interaction problem. The result of this research is usefull for the success of applying the PSSMDF floor system as product diversification in industrial building construction...|$|R
40|$|A method <b>for</b> {{designing}} <b>structural</b> <b>floor</b> {{systems is}} presented. The method {{is capable of}} determining an optimum set of design variables, such as joist spacing, joist dimensions for arbitrary spans and floor loadings. Two existing computer programs, a finite element analysis and a non-linear optimizer, have been integrated to be input-output compatible. The resulting method gives an engineer the options of minimizing either wood volume, floor weight, or costs. An objective function for costs is suggested which includes raw lumber and fasteners, costs for finish and treatment, labor and transportation. Some examples used to illustrate the method are included. The examples use two wood species. Analysis methods are corrected for torsional instability and added bracing. An extended method for walls, roof trusses and other subsystems is outlined for future research. A list of references is included...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{patented}} self-tensioning system <b>for</b> long-span wooden <b>structural</b> <b>floors</b> {{is described}} {{that increases the}} performance of the deflected sections in terms of both resistance and deformation. The system is based on a force multiplier mechanism composed by two connecting rods which are secured to a post-stressing tendon. The mechanical device is activated by the transmission of the load from the structural element to the supports, causing an elongation and stressing the tendon. This transmission comes with a slight vertical displacement of the supports. Throughout this system, the intensity of the tensioning force varies with the applied load; thus, a more favorable bending moment distribution from the load is obtained, and the relative deformations of the different sections of the piece are reduced. This article presents a comparative study of the structural behavior of π-shape cross section wooden <b>structural</b> <b>floors</b> with spans from 9 m to 18 m, comparing sections with and without pre-stress, and sections with the self-tensioning system...|$|R

50|$|Insulating {{concrete}} form or insulated {{concrete form}} (ICF) {{is a system}} of <b>formwork</b> <b>for</b> reinforced concrete usually made with a rigid thermal insulation that stays in place as a permanent interior and exterior substrate for walls, floors, and roofs. The forms are interlocking modular units that are dry-stacked (without mortar) and filled with concrete. The units lock together somewhat like Lego bricks and create a form <b>for</b> the <b>structural</b> walls or <b>floors</b> of a building. ICF construction has become commonplace for both low rise commercial and high performance residential construction as more stringent energy efficiency and natural disaster resistant building codes are adopted. ICFs may be used with frost protected shallow foundations (FPSF).|$|R

40|$|Background: Low {{frequency}} vibration {{case study}} about problems, constraints and design solutions to control vibration in <b>structural</b> <b>floor</b> <b>for</b> a {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) system. Objective: Structural “de-tuning ” and “decoupling ” concepts are employed to achieve compliance with strict allowable floor vibration criteria. The building structure required reinforcement to accommodate the MRI magnet’s concentrated load, but invasive disturbance to a transgenic research mouse vivarium below was prohibited. Methods: Measurements revealed continuous vibration at certain frequencies exceeding criteria. Transient and impact sources could also excite building resonant frequencies. Specific sources and the existing floor resonant frequency were determined by ambient and impact response vibration measurements. A resonant frequency criterion was recommended <b>for</b> the new <b>structural</b> <b>floor</b> design. Spectral analyses of vibration, dynamic analyses of alternate structural concepts and existing physical conflict constraints lead to design of an independent platform floor above the existing building floor. Design parameters included structural strength, stiffness and the specific platform resonant frequency (non-coincident with known vibration sources or building structure). Vibration measurements on the existing structure will show the building condition prior to construction. Structural plan and section drawings will illustrate the design solution. Results: Post construction vibration measurements will be compared to earlier measurement data on graphic charts to show quantitative result of the design. The final result satisfied manufacturer’s criteria. The manufacturer’s start-up commissioning testing validated optimum operation capability, with no “artifacts ” or image distortions typical of excess vibration conditions. Conclusion: The case study demonstrates the advantage of dynamic analysis and vibration de-tuning in structural design. 49...|$|R

40|$|Energy use in {{buildings}} has come more into focus in recent years. An airtight building envelope {{with a low}} infiltration is a definite prerequisite to achieve an energy efficient building. Recently the Norwegian airtightness requirements have become stricter. This leads to an increased focus on airtight constructions and methods. Platform constructed <b>structural</b> <b>floors</b> are widely used in Norway. Air leakages are frequently observed in connection with <b>structural</b> <b>floors,</b> both at the wall/floor and wall/ceiling junction and as leakages into the floor or into the ceiling. This article discusses {{the importance of the}} leakages in platform constructed <b>structural</b> <b>floors</b> on the airtightness of wood-frame houses. This is done by laboratory measurements of vapour barriers and wind-barriers mounted on a wall with <b>structural</b> <b>floor</b> beams. The results show that the airtightness performance of the vapour barrier can be made almost as good as the wind-barrier. However, this is quite labour-intensive. With a properly mounted wind-barrier, the influence of the <b>structural</b> <b>floors</b> on the airtightness of a wood-frame house can be made negligible. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Household and {{pyramidal}} architecture at K'axob {{went through}} multiple phases {{in response to}} increasing population and social complexity throughout the Preclassic and Classic periods. Most household complexes at K'axob were constructed on top of raised mounds or platforms; over 100 of these residential platforms exist at the site. Some of the residential households were arranged in clusters {{of two or more}} structures surrounding a central patio area on basal platform mounds, while single mounds consisted of one residential structure. Larger corporate households were occupied by 20-30 people, while smaller households held around 8 people [...] Differentiation between house sizes are an indication of a complex, stratified society.
