25|$|The {{final game}} between Jenn Hanna of Ontario and Jennifer Jones of Manitoba {{came down to}} the very last shot. Ontario had control of the game, and looked like they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> if off at the end. However, in the last end they did not have the hammer, meaning Jones would have last rock. Ontario had a rock on the button that was well guarded, and the only way at it was an in-off a rock sitting just outside the house. Jones made this very {{difficult}} shot, which gave her four points and the win.|$|E

Bird printed {{the volume on}} a hand-press with handmade paper, telling Hemingway, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> something really fancy with your book". The book contained eighteen vignettes and only thirty-one pages; each one was laid out with plenty of white space, highlighting the brevity of the prose. According to Cohen, the [...] "visual suddenness intensifies its narrative abruptness, heightens the shock of violence, and the chillingly matter-of-fact tone". The book's presentation was intended as unconventional, with its use of lowercase throughout and lack of quotation marks. When challenged by American editors {{over the use of}} lowercase in the titles, Hemingway admitted that it could be seen as [...] "silly and affected".|$|E

500|$|Welles {{signed his}} {{contract}} with RKO on August 21. This legendary contract stipulated that Welles would act in, direct, produce and write two films. Mercury would get $100,000 for the first film by January 1, 1940, plus 20% of profits after RKO recouped $500,000, and $125,000 for a second film by January 1, 1941, plus 20% of profits after RKO recouped $500,000. The most controversial aspect of the contract was granting Welles complete artistic control of the two films so long as RKO approved both project's stories and {{so long as the}} budget did not exceed $500,000. RKO executives {{would not be allowed to}} see any footage until Welles chose to show it to them, and no cuts could be made to either film without Welles's approval. Welles was allowed to develop the story without interference, select his own cast and crew, and have the right of final cut. Granting final cut privilege was unprecedented for a studio since it placed artistic considerations over financial investment. The contract was deeply resented in the film industry, and the Hollywood press took every opportunity to mock RKO and Welles. Schaefer remained a great supporter and saw the unprecedented contract as good publicity. Film scholar Robert L. Carringer wrote: [...] "The simple fact seems to be that Schaefer believed Welles was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> off something really big almost as much as Welles did himself." ...|$|E
500|$|U2 and McGuinness {{thought that}} too much money had been {{invested}} to abort the concert, and they sympathised with the fans who had travelled to the venue in the poor weather. Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. It was cold and raining and everybody was shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, it was going to happen, and it was not going to be tolerated that anybody would do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I just stood there and went, [...] "This is so cool.

500|$|The {{season was}} well {{received}} amongst critics, especially {{in regards to}} the episodes with Kevin Smith and the storylines on oral sex and the school shooting. The Palm Beach Post said the series [...] "is told from a teenager's point of view since the writers have no interest in appealing to a broad-based demographic like the writers on, say, Fox's The O.C. ... it connects with teens on their level", though it was still [...] "surprised Jay used the graphic oral sex term you'd hear in just about every high school hallway in America", that word being [...] "blow-job". The Boston Herald said [...] "it is important for teens to learn about sexually transmitted diseases and the cost of unprotected sex ... and should help parents begin conversations with their own children". PopMatters's Jodie Janella Horn described Degrassi: The Next Generation as [...] "the most unnervingly accurate series ever of the high school genre". Another comparison was made between Degrassi: The Next Generation and The O.C., saying [...] "The O.C. will never remind me of anything in my life", while the events in the two-part episode [...] "Voices Carry" [...] with [...] "hotel room trashing, projectile launching, fist fighting at weddings bi-polar loon Craig , was like an actual scene from my actual teenage life and just like me, Ashley thinks they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> through it together". AfterElton.com, a website that focuses on the portrayal of gay and bisexual men in the media praised the series for [...] "not only focusing on gay teens, but it showcases gay sex, and relationships. By not stereotyping [...] they are helping thousands of confused and shameful teenagers feel accepted, in Canada and America alike." [...] Ben Neihart called Degrassi: The Next Generation [...] "tha Best Teen TV N da WRLD!" [...] (the best teen TV in the world) in a six-page article in The New York Times. Commenting that [...] "the explosive-issue-per-capita ratio is seriously out of whack", he admitted that [...] "the teen-diary attention to microissues (zits, periods, parents' night) gives the episodes a peculiar authenticity no matter how outrageous their story lines".|$|E

2500|$|In December 2010, Melissa Rosenberg was {{developing}} AKA Jessica Jones, {{based on the}} comic book series Alias. Centered on the character Jessica Jones, the series was developed for ABC under Rosenberg's new production banner Tall Girls Productions, along with ABC Studios and Marvel Television. The series was intended to air in 2011 of the 2011–12 television season, with Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb, Joe Quesada, Alan Fine, and Howard Klein as executive producers, and Alias writer Brian Michael Bendis as a consultant. At the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International, Loeb said the series was [...] "about a failed superhero who is rebuilding {{her life as a}} private detective in New York City,” and would include the characters Carol Danvers and Luke Cage. In November, Rosenberg said the show was now [...] "hoping to get on the schedule for" [...] 2012 of the 2012–13 television season, and added, [...] "I love this character. That is an incredibly damaged, dark, complex female character that kicks ass... a former superhero with PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder." [...] She also stated that, while Cage {{was a part of the}} series, the couple's daughter Danielle would appear [...] "way down the road." [...] Rosenberg said later in the month that the series would acknowledge the existence of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with references to Tony Stark and Stark Industries in the pilot script, but admitted that [...] "As we go along things will alter in terms of what is made available to us, but we're definitely in that universe. We are in no way denying that that universe exists. And as much as I can I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> everything in from there that I can use".
