40|$|At the {{atmosphere}} simulation chamber SAPHIR in Julich both Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy (LIF) and Long-Path <b>Differential</b> <b>Optical</b> Laser <b>Absorption</b> <b>Spectroscopy</b> (DOAS) are operational {{for the detection}} of OH radicals at tropospheric levels. The two different spectroscopic techniques were compared within the controlled environment of SAPHIR based on all simultaneous measurements acquired in 2003 (13 days). Hydroxyl radicals were scavenged by added CO during four of these days in order to experimentally check the calculated precisions at the detection limit. LIF measurements have a higher precision (sigma = 0. 88 x 10 (6) cm(- 3)) and better time resolution (Delta t = 60 s), but the DOAS method (sigma = 1. 24 x 10 (6) cm(- 3), Delta t = 135 s) is regarded as primary standard for comparisons because of its good accuracy. A high correlation coefficient of r = 0. 95 was found for the whole data set highlighting the advantage of using a simulation chamber. The data set consists of two groups. The first one includes 3 days, where the LIF measurements yield (1 2) x 10 (6) cm(- 3) higher OH concentrations than observed by the DOAS instrument. The experimental conditions during these days are characterized by increased NOx concentration and a small dynamic range in OH. Excellent agreement is found within the other group of 6 days. The regression to the combined data of this large group yields unity slope without a significant offset...|$|R
40|$|Hydroxyl {{radicals}} (OH) are {{the major}} oxidizing species in the troposphere. Because of their central importance, absolute measurements of their concentrations are needed to validate chemical mechanisms of atmospheric models. The extremely low and highly variable concentrations in the troposphere, however, make measurements of OH difficult. Three techniques are currently used worldwide for tropospheric observations of OH after about 30 ~years of technical developments: <b>Differential</b> <b>Optical</b> Laser <b>Absorption</b> <b>Spectroscopy</b> (DOAS), Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy (LIF), and Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (CIMS). Even though many measurement campaigns with OH data were published, the question of accuracy and precision is still under discussion. Here, we report results of the first formal, blind intercomparison of these techniques. Six OH instruments (4 ~LIF, 1 ~CIMS, 1 ~DOAS) participated successfully in the ground-based, international HOxComp campaign carried out in Jülich, Germany, in summer 2005. Comparisons were performed for three days in ambient air (3 ~LIF, 1 CIMS) and for six days in the atmosphere simulation chamber SAPHIR (3 ~LIF, 1 ~DOAS). All instruments were found to measure tropospheric OH concentrations with high sensitivity and good time resolution. The pairwise correlations between different data sets were linear and yielded high correlation coefficients (r 2 = 0. 75 &minus; 0. 96). Excellent absolute agreement was observed for the instruments at the SAPHIR chamber, yielding slopes between 1. 01 and 1. 13 in the linear regressions. In ambient air, the slopes deviated from unity by factors of 1. 06 to 1. 69, which can partly {{be explained by the}} stated instrumental accuracies. In addition, sampling inhomogeneities and calibration problems have apparently contributed to the discrepancies. The absolute intercepts of the linear regressions did not exceed 0. 6 &times; 10 6 cm&minus; 3 , mostly being insignificant and of minor importance for daytime observations of OH. No relevant interferences with respect to ozone, water vapour, NOx and peroxy radicals could be detected. The HOxComp campaign has demonstrated that OH can be measured reasonably well by current instruments, but also that there is still room for improvement of calibrations...|$|R

The instrument {{is part of}} the Total Column Carbon Observation Network (TCCON), which is a network of ground-based Fourier transform spectrometers designed to retrieve precise and accurate column abundances of atmospheric constituents including CO 2, CH 4, nitrous oxide (N 2 O), hydrogen fluoride (HF), CO, and water vapor isotopologues (Wunch et al. 2011). The TCCON was established in 2004 and is currently affiliated with 26 sites. In addition, other remote sensing observations have been conducted by lidar (Welton et al. 2000), multipass <b>optical</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (MOAS) (Armerding et al. 1997; Comes et al. 1995, 1997), <b>differential</b> <b>optical</b> <b>absorption</b> spectrometry (DOAS) (Carslaw et al. 1997; Gil et al. 2000, 2008), and multi axis-DOAS (MAX-DOAS) (Puentedura et al. 2012).|$|R
