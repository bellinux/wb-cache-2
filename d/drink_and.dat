40|$|Purpose: To {{discuss the}} {{composition}} and rationale {{for the use of}} sports drinks along with recent studies investigating the relationship between sports <b>drinks</b> <b>and</b> dental erosion. Methods: A review of the literature of sports <b>drinks</b> <b>and</b> dental erosion was done. Results: For most athletes and individuals engaged in physical activity, the use of sports drinks does not provide a benefit over water. Furthermore, although there is much in vitro evidence that acidic drinks such as wine, fruit juices <b>and</b> carbonated soft <b>drinks</b> have erosive potential and there are relationships between consumption of these <b>drinks</b> <b>and</b> erosion, only one study has reported an association between sports <b>drinks</b> <b>and</b> dental erosion. Other factors such as drinking habit and salivary production may be more important determinants of dental erosion...|$|R
