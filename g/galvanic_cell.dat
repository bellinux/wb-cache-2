5|$|Eighteenth century {{scientific}} laboratories usually contained {{some form}} of hand-operated electrostatic machine. Italian scientist Luigi Galvani had an electrostatic generator in his laboratory, where experiments with frog legs led {{to the discovery of}} animal electricity. Another Italian scientist, Alessandro Volta, disagreed with some of Galvani's ideas, and this scientific argument motivated Volta to develop the first frog-free <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell,</b> and led directly to the invention of the first practical electric battery, the voltaic pile.|$|E
5|$|Galvani's friend, Alessandro Volta, {{continued}} {{researching the}} effect and invented the Voltaic pile in 1800. The basic unit of Volta's pile was a simplified <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell,</b> made of plates of copper and zinc separated by an electrolyte and {{connected by a}} conductor externally. The units were stacked in series to make the Voltaic cell, which produced electricity by directing electrons from the zinc to the copper and allowing the zinc to corrode.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{cultures}} {{around the}} Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus {{made a series}} of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing. Thales was incorrect in believing the attraction was due to a magnetic effect, but later science would prove a link between magnetism and electricity. According to a controversial theory, the Parthians may have had knowledge of electroplating, based on the 1936 discovery of the Baghdad Battery, which resembles a <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell,</b> though it is uncertain whether the artifact was electrical in nature.|$|E

5|$|In 1829, {{at the age}} of 15, Colt {{began working}} in his father's textile plant in Ware, Massachusetts, where he had access to tools, materials, and the factory workers' expertise. Following the encyclopedia, Samuel built a {{homemade}} <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell</b> and advertised as a Fourth of July event in that year that he would blow up a raft on Ware Pond using underwater explosives; although the raft was missed, the explosion was still impressive. Sent to boarding school, he amused his classmates with pyrotechnics. In 1830, a July 4 accident caused a fire that ended his schooling, and his father sent him off to learn the seaman's trade. On a voyage to Calcutta on board the brig Corvo, he noticed that regardless of which way the ship's wheel was spun, each spoke always came in direct line with a clutch that could be set to hold it. He later said that this gave him the idea for the revolver. On the Corvo, Colt made a wooden model of a pepperbox revolver out of scrap wood. It differed from other pepperbox revolvers at the time in that it would allow the shooter to rotate the cylinder by the action of cocking the hammer with an attached pawl turning the cylinder which is then locked firmly in alignment with one of the barrels by a bolt, a great improvement over the pepperbox designs which required rotating the barrels by hand and hoping for proper indexing and alignment.|$|E

50|$|A {{battery is}} a set of <b>galvanic</b> <b>cells</b> that are {{connected}} together to form a single source of voltage. For instance, a typical 12V lead-acid battery has six <b>galvanic</b> <b>cells</b> connected in series with the anodes composed of lead and cathodes composed of lead dioxide. Large battery rooms, for instance in a telephone exchange providing central office power to user's telephones, may have cells connected in both series and parallel.|$|R

25|$|An {{electrochemical}} cell is {{a device that}} produces an electric current from energy released by a spontaneous redox reaction. This kind of cell includes the <b>Galvanic</b> <b>cell</b> or Voltaic cell, named after Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta, both scientists who conducted several experiments on chemical reactions and electric current during the late 18th century.|$|E

Stray direct currents in soil may counteract the anti-corrosion effect of a cathodic protection system. Design of high voltage direct current transmission systems must take care so that current flowing in the earth does not cause objectionable corrosion to buried objects such as pipelines.|$|E

25|$|Electrophoresis {{refers to}} the {{electromotive}} force (EMF) {{that is used to}} move the molecules through the gel matrix. By placing the molecules in wells in the gel and applying an electric field, the molecules will move through the matrix at different rates, determined largely by their mass when the charge-to-mass ratio (Z) of all species is uniform. However, when charges are not all uniform then, the electrical field generated by the electrophoresis procedure will affect the species that have different charges and therefore will attract the species according to their charges being the opposite. Species that are positively charged will migrate towards the cathode which is negatively charged (because this is an electrolytic rather than <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell).</b> If the species are negatively charged they will migrate towards the positively charged anode.|$|E
25|$|The <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell</b> uses two {{different}} metal electrodes, each in an electrolyte where the positively charged ions are the oxidized {{form of the}} electrode metal. One electrode will undergo oxidation (the anode) and the other will undergo reduction (the cathode). The metal of the anode will oxidize, going from an oxidation state of 0 (in the solid form) to a positive oxidation state and become an ion. At the cathode, the metal ion in solution will accept one or more electrons from the cathode and the ion's oxidation state is reduced to 0. This forms a solid metal that electrodeposits on the cathode. The two electrodes must be electrically connected to each other, allowing for a flow of electrons that leave the metal of the anode and flow through this connection to the ions at {{the surface of the}} cathode. This flow of electrons is an electric current {{that can be used to}} do work, such as turn a motor or power a light.|$|E
500|$|Italian doctor Luigi Galvani {{discovered}} in 1780 that connecting {{the spinal cord}} of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog's leg to twitch. He incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity and called the effect [...] "animal electricity". The <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell</b> {{and the process of}} galvanization were both named for Luigi Galvani, and his discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries, galvanization, and cathodic protection.|$|E
40|$|A {{microscale}} apparatus for {{electrochemical cell}} in which plaster (CaSO 4) {{was used as}} liquid junction has been developed. A glass tube (0. 5 cm ID x 5. 0 cm) was used to prepare each half-cell. The potentials of the resulting <b>galvanic</b> <b>cells</b> were measured by a multimetre and were compared {{to those of the}} <b>galvanic</b> <b>cells</b> in which agar was used as liquid junction. It was found that the potentials produced by the <b>galvanic</b> <b>cells</b> with plaster as liquid junction are not significantly {{different from those of the}} cells with agar as liquid junction and close to the theoretical values. In addition, when the developed apparatus was used for the study of electrolysis of potassium iodide solution, it was found that the electrolytic cell made from the microscale apparatus with plaster liquid junction can distinctly separate the reactions occurring at the anode and the cathode. Moreover, the lifetime of the plaster liquid junction is much greater than that of the agar liquid junction...|$|R

These principles are aplied into the design of electronic tester which is described in detail in the next chapter. The designed device is controlled by a microprocessor chip ATmega 16, whose software is thoroughly described in the second part. In the end {{you can find the}} results of testing and assessment of these tests...|$|R
2500|$|An {{electric}} field is applied across the gel, causing the negatively charged proteins or nucleic acids to migrate across the gel {{away from the}} negative electrode (which is the cathode being {{that this is an}} electrolytic rather than <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell)</b> and towards the positive electrode (the anode). Depending on their size, each biomolecule moves differently through the gel matrix: small molecules more easily fit through the pores in the gel, while larger ones have more difficulty. The gel is run usually for a few hours, though this depends on the voltage applied across the gel; migration occurs more quickly at higher voltages, but these results are typically less accurate than at those at lower voltages. [...] After the set amount of time, the biomolecules have migrated different distances based on their size. Smaller biomolecules travel farther down the gel, while larger ones remain closer to the point of origin. Biomolecules may therefore be separated roughly according to size, which depends mainly on molecular weight under denaturing conditions, but also depends on higher-order conformation under native conditions. The gel mobility is defined as the rate of migration traveled with a voltage gradient of 1V/cm and has units of cm2/sec/V. For analytical purposes, the relative mobility of biomolecules, Rf, the ratio of the distance the molecule traveled on the gel to the total travel distance of a tracking dye is plotted versus the molecular weight of the molecule (or sometimes the log of MW, or rather the Mr, molecular radius). Such typically linear plots represent the standard markers or calibration curves that are widely used for the quantitative estimation of a variety of biomolecular sizes.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell,</b> the cathode {{is where}} the {{positive}} pole is connected to allow the circuit to be completed: as the anode of the <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell</b> gives off electrons, they return from the circuit into the cell through the cathode.|$|E
50|$|To an {{external}} wire {{connected to the}} electrodes of a <b>Galvanic</b> <b>cell</b> (or battery), forming an electric circuit, the cathode is positive and the anode is negative.

50|$|The {{electrode}} potential cannot be obtained empirically. The <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell</b> potential {{results from a}} pair of electrodes. Thus, only one empirical value is available in a pair of electrodes and {{it is not possible to}} determine the value for each electrode in the pair using the empirically obtained <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell</b> potential. A reference electrode, standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), for which the potential is defined or agreed upon by convention, needed to be established. In this case SHE is set to 0.00 V and any electrode, for which the {{electrode potential}} is not yet known, can be paired with SHE - to form a <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell</b> - and the <b>galvanic</b> <b>cell</b> potential gives the unknown electrode's potential. Using this process, any electrode with an unknown potential can be paired with either the SHE or another electrode for which the potential has already been derived and that unknown value can be established.|$|E
40|$|Abstract (An {{approach}} to pre-university and university studentsâ€™ conceptions about <b>galvanic</b> <b>cells)</b> In {{this study we}} investigated alternative conceptions about <b>galvanic</b> <b>cells</b> and interpretations of the process occurring in a voltaic cell.

Comparative analysis of the results obtained by means of a test and an open question reveals that: a) Many high school and university students hold misconceptions about galvanic cells; b) There is no significant difference in misconceptions and interpretations between the two groups of students, and c) Few students can correctly explain how a voltaic cell works.
