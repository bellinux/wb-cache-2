40|$|The {{present study}} {{is an attempt to}} improve the {{trickling}} filter performance by enhancing both the oxygen transfer rate and wetting percent of the media surface this was achieved using radial jet nozzle configuration instead of the conventional circular nozzle. The distributor-offset distance from the bed was taken into consideration as a geometric variable parameter. Two pilot-scale trickling filters were constructed on field to evaluate the effect of radial jet nozzle and offset distance on the trickling filter performance. Results indicated that the distribution system has major effects on the trickling filter performance, and that radial jet nozzle increased BOD removal ratio by approximately 10 % higher than the conventional nozzle for <b>fixed</b> <b>distributor</b> and by approximately 7 % for rotating distributor, radial jet nozzle also enhanced DO % on the filter effluent for <b>fixed</b> <b>distributor</b> but not for the rotating one. The offset distance has approximately no effect on trickling filter performance. Increasing hydraulic loading rate reduced trickling filter efficiency, as the hydraulic retention time reduced...|$|E

500|$|Many feminist {{critics have}} pondered {{the reason for}} the character's iconic status. Nancy's car, and her skill in driving and {{repairing}} it, are often cited. Melanie Rehak points to Nancy's famous blue roadster (now a blue hybrid) as a symbol of [...] "ultimate freedom and independence." [...] Not only does Nancy have the freedom to go where she pleases (a freedom other, similar characters such as The Dana Girls do not have), but she is also able to change a tire and <b>fix</b> a flawed <b>distributor,</b> prompting Paretsky to argue that in [...] "a nation where car mechanics still mock or brush off complaints by women Nancy remains a significant role model." ...|$|R
50|$|Twice each working day, four LPPM members (large {{international}} banks, producers, refiners, fabricators, {{manufacturers and}} <b>distributors)</b> <b>fix</b> the bid prices. The bid price is one at {{which members of}} LPPM guarantee that they will buy good delivery metal. The bid prices for the metals are benchmarks for the market and therefore for the industry. The bid prices, in turn, affect the offer prices that customers are asked to pay for metal. The market values of the metals, {{as is the case}} for all commodities, ultimately affect manufacturing costs. Unlike a futures exchange, an OTC market offers some flexibility and confidentiality of transactions carried out between two entities. Many transactions are speculative; only a fraction of deals are closed via a physical delivery.|$|R
5000|$|In a May 2014 New York Times column, Josh Barro {{pointed to}} {{academic}} research concluding that an {{a la carte}} system would not benefit customers. A typical subscriber, he wrote, would pay [...] "slightly more on cable under an unbundled system, while watching slightly fewer channels." [...] A 2011 Stanford University study cited by Barro simulated a 49-channel subscription bundle being switched to an la carte scheme. The researchers concluded that subscribers would pay 103.0% more in fees passed on by distributors, while consumer welfare would likely be worse, changing between -5.4% and 0.2%. Part {{of the reason is}} efficiency: some distribution costs are <b>fixed</b> whether a <b>distributor</b> provides a few channels or many. If fewer people subscribe, the base subscription rate is likely to go up. In addition, programmers would receive less revenue in carriage fees and advertising revenues, and would look to its remaining viewers to make up the difference. However, some subscribers would benefit from a la carte, including those who have opted out of bundled channels, but might subscribe to just a few, as well as subscribers with no interest in sports. Casual sports fans, on the other hand, could pay a higher rate.|$|R
40|$|Presents {{information}} {{and analysis of}} the network tariffs applicable to household electricity consumers in the southern and eastern states of Australia covered by the National Energy Market. Executive summary: This report presents {{information and}} analysis of the network tariffs applicable to household electricity consumers in the southern and eastern states of Australia covered by the National Energy Market (NEM). The paper is the first of four papers focused on network tariffs from the perspective of households. Key findings include: 	A range of network tariff structures are used throughout the NEM. Inclining block rate tariffs (with small price increments) and two-part tariffs are common. 	The most expensive network tariff in Australia is almost four times higher than the least expensive. 	The average network charge to households in Victoria is about a third of that elsewhere in the NEM 	The gap between least expensive and most expensive network tariff has doubled over the last seven years. 	Network service providers in Queensland have the highest charges and also the greater proportion of their charge is <b>fixed.</b> The Queensland <b>distributors</b> and Ausnet Services in Victoria have increased their fixed charges significantly recently. In the 2015 / 16 year (not covered in this report Citipower and Powercor have both increased their fixed charges significantly). 	Network service providers are typically increasing fixed charges more quickly than variable charges. 	The international comparison shows that network tariffs in Britain are generally much lower than anywhere in Australia. The average network charge in Denmark and New Zealand is roughly comparable to those in Victoria, the lowest network cost jurisdiction in the NEM. 	The proportion of revenue recovered from fixed charges charged to most consumers in the NEM is higher than that in Britain, Denmark and New Zealand. Some distributors in Victoria have relatively smaller fixed charges, while those in Queensland and Essential Energy in New South Wales have fixed charges that are much higher than those found elsewhere. In NZ, network tariffs with higher fixed charges apply to households with high levels of consumption (> 9 MWh per year) ...|$|R
