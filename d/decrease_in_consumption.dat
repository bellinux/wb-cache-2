The simulation results indicate that if all revenue of newly arrived capital accrues to foreign investors and the government maintains budget neutrality, in the long-run this would expand GDP slightly. In general, capital-intensive sectors experience robust expansion and labour-intensive sectors suffer a contraction in output and employment. Urban households experience increases <b>in</b> <b>consumption</b> because they are relatively heavily concentrated in manufacturing sectors that are favourably affected.

50|$|Data {{on global}} and {{regional}} food supply shows that consumption rose from 2011-2012 in all regions. Diets became more diverse, with a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>consumption</b> of cereals and roots {{and an increase}} in fruits, vegetables, and meat products. However, this increase masks the discrepancies between nations, where Africa, in particular, saw a decrease in food consumption over the same years. This information is derived from food balance sheets that reflect national food supplies, however, this does not necessarily reflect the distribution of micro and macronutrients. Often inequality in food access leaves distribution which uneven, resulting in undernourishment for some and obesity for others.|$|E

5000|$|While [...] "marginal" [...] {{in common}} usage tends to mean [...] "tangential", {{implying}} limited importance, in economics [...] "marginal" [...] means [...] "incremental". For example, the marginal {{propensity to consume}} refers to the incremental tendency to spend income on consumer goods: the fraction of any additional income which is spent on additional consumption (or conversely, the fraction of any decrease in income which becomes a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>consumption).</b> Likewise, the marginal product of capital refers to the additional production of output that results from using an additional unit of physical capital (machinery, etc.). If very small increments are being considered, so that calculus is used, then this ratio of incremental amounts is a derivative (for example, the marginal propensity to consume becomes the derivative of consumption with respect to income).|$|E
5000|$|Illegal {{sales are}} not officially {{reported}} or measured, {{but there are}} indirect estimates using alcohol related deaths and cirrhosis, a liver disease specifically tied to ongoing alcohol consumption. Scholars estimate that consumption dropped {{to a low of}} about 60% of pre-prohibition levels around 1925, rising to almost 80% before the law was officially repealed. After the prohibition was implemented, alcohol continued to be consumed. However, how much compared to pre-Prohibition levels remains unclear. Studies examining the rates of cirrhosis deaths as a proxy for alcohol consumption estimated a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>consumption</b> of 10-20%. However, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's studies show clear epidemiological evidence that [...] "overall cirrhosis mortality rates declined precipitously with the introduction of Prohibition," [...] despite widespread flouting of the law.One study reviewing city-level drunkenness arrests came to a similar result. And, yet another study examining [...] "mortality, mental health and crime statistics" [...] found that alcohol consumption fell, at first, to approximately 30 percent of its pre-Prohibition level; but, over the next several years, increased to about 60-70 percent of its pre-prohibition level.|$|E
50|$|A {{significant}} rise {{in global}} temperatures will negatively affect dairy production in Washington state, {{which had a}} total of 560 dairy farms {{at the end of}} 2004. Each region will be affected differently based on the different climate and temperature fluctuations. Current predictions forecast that by 2075, milk production in the Yakima River Valley will drastically decrease during the summer months. The worst effects of climate change will be a decrease in daily milk production from 27 kg to 20 kg in the month of August. Whatcom County dairy farms are predicted to be less affected by climate change than Yakima Valley. Summer milk production in Whatcom County is projected to fall from a little under 27 kg per cow per day to slightly more than 25 kg per cow per day. In both regions the lower milk production is directly correlated to the <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>consumption</b> of food stuffs. The decrease in food availability during summer is due to increasing annual temperatures that shift precipitation levels and cause a faster run-off of snowpack. With less food for the cows, milk production drastically decreases during the summer months. Higher temperatures cause a decrease in milk production.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} whether the presence of Clinical Pharmacist affects the cost of drug therapy for patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Al-Hussein hospital at Royal Medical Services in Amman, Jordan. MethodThis study compares the consumed quantities of drugs over two periods of time. Each period was ten months long. In the second period there was a Clinical Pharmacist. The <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>consumption</b> rate of drugs {{is considered to be}} an indicator of the success of Clinical Pharmacist in the ICU, as any <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>consumption</b> rate reflects the correct application of Clinical Pharmacy practices. The cost of this <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>consumption</b> rate represents the total reduction of drug therapy cost. ResultsThe total reduction of drug therapy cost after applying Clinical Pharmacy practices in the ICU over a period of ten months was 149946. 80 JD (211574. 90 USD), which represents an average saving of 35. 8 % when compared to the first period in this study. ConclusionThe results of this study showed a significant reduction in the consumed quantities of drugs and therefore a reduction in cost of drug therapy.

40|$|This paper compares {{results from}} a lab {{experiment}} and a field experiment conducted in France to evaluate the impact of health information on fish consumption. In both experiments, health information concerns a benefit (omega 3) and a risk (methylmercury). While the lab experiment focuses on two species, namely canned tuna and canned sardines, the field experiment offers a complete measure of the information impact on the choice of various species by consumers. Results from both experiments showed a significant preference change against canned tuna. In the lab experiment, the preference change was reflected by a decrease in WTP, while in the field experiment the preference change was reflected by a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>consumption.</b> In the field experiment, among all fish consumed, only the <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>consumption</b> of canned tuna was statistically significant. A model calibrated to represent the demand for canned tuna allows for a comparison between the two experiments. It shows that the lab experiment suggests a smaller decrease in canned tuna demand compared to the field experiment. ...|$|E
