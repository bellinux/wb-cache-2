This study aimed to define the therapeutic window for solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) as a drug delivery system by inhalation from a toxicological point of view. To estimate the toxic dose of SLNs in vitro, A 549 cells and murine precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) were exposed to increasing concentrations of SLNs. The cytotoxic effect of SLNs on A 549 cells was evaluated by MTT and NRU assays. Viability of lung tissue was determined with WST assay and by life/dead staining using calcein AM/EthD- 1 for confocal microscopy (CLSM) followed by quantitative analysis with IMARIS. Inflammation was assessed by measuring chemokine KC and TNF-? levels. The in vivo effects were determined in a 16 -day repeated-dose inhalation toxicity study using female BALB/c mice, which were daily exposed to different concentrations of SLN 30 aerosols (1 – 200 ?g <b>deposit</b> <b>dose).</b> Local inflammatory effects in the respiratory tract were evaluated by determination of total protein content, LDH, chemokine KC, IL- 6, and differential cell counts, performed on days 4, 8, 12, and 16 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Additionally, a histopathological evaluation of toxicologically relevant organs was accomplished. The in vitro and ex vivo dose finding experiments showed toxic effects beginning at concentrations of about 500 ?g/ml. Therefore, we used 1 – 200 ?g deposit doses/animal for the in vivo experiments. Even after 16 days of challenge with a 200 -?g <b>deposit</b> <b>dose,</b> SLNs induced no significant signs of inflammation. We observed no consistent increase in LDH release, protein levels, or other signs of inflammation such as chemokine KC, IL- 6, or neutrophilia. In contrast, the particle control (carbon black) caused inflammatory and cytotoxic effects at corresponding concentrations. These results confirm that repeated inhalation exposure to SLN 30 at concentrations lower than a 200 -?g <b>deposit</b> <b>dose</b> is safe in a murine inhalation model...|$|E
40|$|Proton {{therapy has}} been used to treat cancer for more than 50 years, and over the past decade, its use has grown rapidly. One of the main goals of modern {{radiation}} therapy is to deliver a high dose to the planning target volume (PTV) with minimal exposure and damage to the surrounding healthy tissue. Protons offer a unique advantage over photon radiotherapy in that they <b>deposit</b> <b>dose</b> over a finite range, in contrast to the more gradual energy deposition of photon and electron beams. At present, 23 proton centers are in operation in the United States and another 13 centers are in development. The increasing interest in the use of protons creates a demand for quality monitoring and evaluation of the treatments provided, especially as they apply to NCI funded clinical trials. The goal of the Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core (IROC) Houston QA Center is to assure NCI that institutions participating in clinical trials deliver radiation treatment plans/doses that are clinically comparable and consistent. IROC Houston makes use of anthropomorphic QA phantoms in order to help verify the quality of the proton treatment process from imaging to treatment delivery.

This model incorporates measured outdoor and modeled indoor particle number size distributions, detailed activity patterns of three age groups (teens, adults, and the elderly), semi-empirical estimation of the regional deposition fraction, hygroscopic properties of urban aerosols, and reported breathing minute volumes. We calculated the total and regional <b>deposited</b> <b>dose</b> based on three concentration metrics: particle number (PN), mass (PM), and surface area (PSA). The 24 -h total <b>deposited</b> <b>dose</b> of fine particles in adult males was around 40 mu g (57 x 109 particles, 8 x 102 mm(2)) and 41 mu g (40 x 109 particles, 8 x 102 mm(2)) on workdays and weekends, respectively. The total and regional 24 -h <b>deposited</b> <b>dose</b> based {{on any of the}} metrics was at most 1. 5 times higher in males than in females. The <b>deposited</b> <b>dose</b> values in the other age groups were slightly different than in adults. Regardless of the particle size fraction or the <b>deposited</b> <b>dose</b> metric, the pulmonary/alveolar region received the largest fraction of the <b>deposited</b> <b>dose.</b> These values represent the lowest estimate of the <b>deposited</b> <b>dose</b> and they are expected to be higher in real-life conditions after considering indoor sources of aerosol particles and spatial variability of outdoor aerosols.

40|$|Purpose: Intensity-modulated {{radiation}} treatment (IMRT) plan optimization needs pre-calculated beamlet dose distribution. Pencil-beam or superposition/convolution type algorithms are typically used {{because of high}} computation speed. However, inaccurate beamlet dose distributions, particularly in cases {{with high levels of}} inhomogeneity, may mislead optimization, hindering the resulting plan quality. It is desire to use Monte Carlo (MC) methods for beamlet dose calculations. Yet, the long computational time from repeated dose calculations for a number of beamlets prevents this application. It is our objective to integrate a GPU-based MC dose engine in lung IMRT optimization using a novel two-steps workflow. Methods : A GPU-based MC code gDPM is used. Each particle is tagged with an index of a beamlet where the source particle is from. <b>Deposit</b> <b>dose</b> are stored separately for beamlets based on the index. Due to limited GPU memory size, a pyramid space is allocated for each beamlet, and dose outside the space is neglected. A two-steps optimization workflow is proposed for fast MC-based optimization. At first step, a rough dose calculation is conducted with only a few number of particle per beamlet. Plan optimization is followed to get an approximated fluence map. In the second step, more accurate beamlet doses are calculated, where sampled number of particles for a beamlet is proportional to the intensity determined previously. A second-round optimization is conducted, yielding the final result. Results: For a lung case with 5317 beamlets, 105 particles per beamlet in the first round, and 108 particles per beam in the second round are enough to get a good plan quality. The total simulation time is 96. 4 sec. Conclusion : A fast GPU-based MC dose calculation method along with a novel two-step optimization workflow are developed. The high efficiency allows the use of MC for IMRT optimizations. [...] Cite this article as: Li Y, Tian Z, Shi F, Jiang S, Jia X. GPU-Monte Carlo based fast IMRT plan optimization.

40|$|The bulk of {{the energy}} {{deposition}} from a proton beam occurs at depth in the Bragg peak. The _nite range of protons in tissue makes them an ideal candidate {{for the treatment of}} deep seated tumours and gives improved tissue sparing distal to the target volume compared to photons. However, the production of secondary neutrons and photons has the potential to deliver unwanted dose far outside the intended treatment volume. The _ndings of this thesis show that the magnitude of the doses from secondary neutrons and photons are small. The risk of second cancer from proton therapy treatments {{has been shown to be}} lower compared to photon techniques despite the presence of secondary neutrons. This thesis also demonstrates the potential advantages of using pencil beam scanning (PBS) compared to double scattering proton therapy. The neutron doses from PBS is signi_cantly lower than double scattering even far from the primary _eld. The rationale for using protons to treat cancer was examined. Treatment planning comparisons at a number of di_erent clinical sites have shown the potential usefulness of proton therapy. A treatment planning comparison has demonstrated the potential use of protons for the treatment of prostate cancer. Through comparison of proton treatment plans with the best achievable photon plans, it was observed that protons can potentially deliver the same dose to the prostate target volume whilst reducing the dose in normal tissue. Secondary neutrons <b>deposit</b> <b>dose</b> via charged secondary particles which often have high linear energy transfer (LET). The high range of neutrons in tissue combined with the production of high-LET secondaries gives the potential of second malignancy induction external to the primary target volume. Secondary neutrons are produced in proton therapy through nuclear interactions in the treatment nozzle and or in the patient directly. The amount of neutron production in the patient is governed by the interaction cross-section. Phantoms which are used to represent human tissue in experimental studies need to be characterised as they have di_erent chemical compositions which alters the amount of neutron production and the neutron energy spectrum. Monte Carlo simulations were used to determine the variation in neutron absorbed dose and dose equivalent from internally produced secondary neutrons in a series of di_erent tissues and phantom materials. Large variations were observed in the neutron doses in the di_erent materials suggesting the choice of phantom material for neutron dosimetry studies is signi_cant for experimental studies, particularly in regions where the total dose is dominated by secondary neutrons generated internally. A dedicated Monte Carlo code was developed for simulation of PBS treatments us- ing the Geant 4 Monte Carlo toolkit. The scanning treatment nozzle at Massachusetts General Hospital was included in the simulation code. Out-of-_eld doses in scanning treatments were previously approximated in Monte Carlo simulations by simulating a double scattering beamline and ignoring the contribution of secondary particles generated in the treatment nozzle. The dose deposition from protons, neutrons and photons was simulated for a _eld designed for the treatment of a deep seated tumour incident upon a Lucite phantom. The results of the simulations showed that the approximation used in previous studies is not valid close to the _eld edge where the wider penumbra from scanning plays a signi_cant role. Further out-of-_eld, the approximation is more acceptable, as the total dose is dominated by internally produced secondary particles. The absorbed dose and dose equivalent out-of-_eld in scanning is approximately an order of magnitude lower than that delivered in double scattering. Employing a patient-speci_c aperture in scanning reduces the penumbral width and the dose close to the _eld edge compared to scanning without an aperture by an order of magnitude. The radiation _eld external to the target volume for a clinical pancreatic _eld was characterised using a _E-E detector. Comparisons were made between double scattering and PBS. Distal to the spread out Bragg peak (SOBP), the neutron uence is higher in double scattering, primarily due to the high amount of neutron production in the treatment nozzle for this modality. The wide penumbra in PBS leads to a higher particle uence upon the detector close to the _eld edge. Further from the _eld edge, the neutron uence is signi_cantly higher from double scattering compared to scanning. Close to the primary _eld, the orientation of the detector was determined to be signi_cant for double scattering. Depending on the chosen orientation, when operated in coincidence mode, the results are biased towards either detection of scattered protons from the primary _eld or neutrons generated in the treatment nozzle. The time to undertake any treatment is important for radiotherapy and the efficiency of patient throughput. The time required for a PBS treatment has not been investigated previously. A series of equations are presented which allow calculation of the time required to deliver a pencil beam scanning treatment based on the system hardware. An SOBP is produced from a database of individual Bragg peaks generated from Monte Carlo simulations. Using a constant distance spacing between individual Bragg peaks in the SOBP allows the required dose conformality to be achieved with the fewest number of layers. The e_ect of each of the parameters in a clinical pencil beam scanning system on the total irradiation time was ascertained. Both a cyclotron and synchrotron were considered as possible beam sources. The equations allow optimisation of the irradiation time by observing the e_ect of altering the system hardware. The equations presented are facility independent and can be applied to any scanning system which uses two perpendicular scanning magnets to scan the beam laterally.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the influence of two inspiratory flow patterns on amikacin delivery with a vibrating-mesh nebulizer placed at different positions on an adult lung model of IMV equipped with a proximal flow sensor (PFS). Methods: IMV was simulated using a ventilator connected to a lung model through an 8 -mm inner-diameter endotracheal tube. The impact of a decelerating and a constant flow pattern on aerosol delivery was evaluated in volume-controlled mode (tidal volume 500 mL, 20 breaths/min, inspiratory time of 1 sec, bias flow of 10 L/min). An amikacin solution (250 mg/ 3 mL) was nebulized with Aeroneb Solo® placed at five positions on the ventilator circuit equipped with a PFS: connected to the endotracheal tube (A), to the Y-piece (B), placed at 15 cm (C) and 45 cm upstream of the Y-piece (D), and placed at 15 cm of the inspiratory outlet of the ventilator (E). The four last positions were also tested without PFS. <b>Deposited</b> <b>doses</b> of amikacin were measured using the gravimetric residual method. Results: Amikacin delivery was significantly reduced with a decelerating inspiratory flow pattern compared to a constant flow (p< 0. 05). With a constant inspiratory flow pattern, connecting the nebulizer to the endotracheal tube enabled similar <b>deposited</b> <b>doses</b> than these obtained when connecting the nebulizer close to the ventilator.

Exposure conditions with PM 1 (< 1 μm) mass concentration 280 μg m− 3, number concentration 4 × 105 cm− 3 and elemental to total carbon fraction of 82 % were generated from a diesel vehicle at idling. When estimating the lung <b>deposited</b> <b>dose</b> it was found that using the size dependent effective density (in contrast to assuming unity density) reduced the estimated respiratory dose by 132 % by mass. Accounting for agglomerated structure of DEP prevented underestimation of lung <b>deposited</b> <b>dose</b> by surface area by 37 % in comparison to assuming spherical particles.

Characterized by steep dose gradients and high fraction doses, these hypo-fractionated treatments are, however, prone to dosimetric errors {{as a result}} of variations in intra-fraction respiratory-induced motion, such as drifts and amplitude alterations. This may lead to significant variations in the <b>deposited</b> <b>dose.</b> This study aims to develop a method for calculating the accumulated dose for MRI-guided SBRT of RCC in the presence of intra-fraction respiratory variations and determine the effect of such variations on the <b>deposited</b> <b>dose.</b> For this, RCC SBRT treatments were simulated while the underlying anatomy was moving, based on motion information from three motion models with increasing complexity: (1) STATIC, in which static anatomy was assumed, (2) AVG-RESP, in which 4 D-MRI phase-volumes were time-weighted, and (3) PCA, a method that generates 3 D volumes with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to capture respiration and intra-fraction variations. Five RCC patients and two volunteers were included and treatments delivery was simulated, using motion derived from subject-specific MR imaging. Motion was most accurately estimated using the PCA method with root-mean-squared errors of 2. 7, 2. 4, 1. 0 mm for STATIC, AVG-RESP and PCA, respectively. The heterogeneous patient group demonstrated relatively large dosimetric differences between the STATIC and AVG-RESP, and the PCA reconstructed dose maps, with hotspots up to 40 % of the D 99 and an underdosed GTV in three out of the five patients. This shows the potential importance of including intra-fraction motion variations in dose calculations...|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{our lives}} we {{are exposed to}} {{ionizing}} radiation from cosmic and environmental sources or from medical diagnostics and treatments. In conventional therapy of malignant tumors, photons or electrons are used. Nowadays we witness the introduction of proton and heavy ion beams which have a different distribution of the <b>deposited</b> <b>dose.</b> The dose peaks {{at the end of}} the particle's track and drops to zero beyond. In this so called Bragg peak range, where the ions have energies between zero and a few MeV, not only the <b>deposited</b> <b>dose</b> is maximum but also the relative biological effectiveness is enhanced. When ionizing radiation crosses a living cell, ionization and fragmentation of biologically relevant molecules such as water and DNA constituents occurs. These processes are the initial steps in DNA damage which in turn has the strongest biological consequences. DNA damage can have different levels of complexity leading to different biological end-points. On the molecular level ion-induced DNA damage is not yet understood. Studies on isolated gas phase molecules allow a detailed investigation of ion-induced molecular mechanisms. In this thesis, the interactions of energetic particles (He, C, H) with biologically relevant molecules (water, deoxyribose, nucleobases) and their clusters were investigated by means of high-resolution coincidence time-of-flight spectrometry. Deoxyribose molecules were found to be the most sensitive to keV ion irradiation. Energetic fragments which can induce further damage were observed in ion-induced dissociation of water molecules. In this thesis also the first step towards more realistic biological systems was taken by studying clusters. The chemical environment is indeed affecting the molecular fragmentation pathways and must be considered in future experiments. ...|$|R

Talca Univ, Fac Engn, Talca, ChileThe Nitinol stent was bombarded in a {{cyclotron}} at a {{flux rate}} of 4 mu A/cm(2) to produce V- 48 via Ti- 48 (p, n) V- 48 reaction. In this study dose distribution of V- 48 radioactive stent was investigated for renal arteries. Version X- 2. 6 of the MCNP Monte Carlo radiation transport system code {{was employed to}} calculate dose distribution around the stent. As V- 48 is a mixed gamma and beta particle emitter, two separate runs of MCNP for both beta and gamma particles were performed and the total <b>deposited</b> <b>dose</b> was acquired by adding the two mentioned values. In order to verify the simulation, the calculated results have been compared with previous published data for the source. Calculated results show high dose gradient near the stent and {{the maximum amount of}} <b>dose</b> <b>deposits</b> at the vessel wall.

The low radiation dose of carbon- 11 must not be understated: any practical use of an imaging biomarker BCM entails repeated scanning in individuals, either as baseline and follow-up examinations in interventional studies, or several examinations to allow appreciation {{of the dynamics of}} BCM during disease progression.

The goals of this study were to select the optimal nebulizer delivery system for ABLC and to measure <b>deposited</b> aerosol <b>dose</b> in 12 lung transplant recipients. In vitro testing was performed to select a nebulizer delivery system, and an empirical model was used to estimate lung deposition. Estimated pulmonary doses varied by as much as 2 -fold between different nebulizers. Aerosol deposition testing was performed in six single and six double lung recipients, each of whom received one 7 mL (35 mg) nebulized dose of Technetium-labeled ABLC using the selected nebulizer. In single lung recipients, the average <b>deposited</b> <b>doses</b> were 3. 9 ± 1. 6 mg (mean ± S. D.) in the allograft versus 2. 1 ± 1. 1 mg in the native lung. Double lung recipients deposited on average 2. 8 ± 0. 8 mg (left lung) and 4. 0 ± 1. 3 mg (right lung). The drug was well distributed throughout the lungs, but delivery to the native lung was in some cases suboptimal. These studies provide an important precursor to studies of the efficacy of inhaled ABLC as a prophylaxis of invasive aspergillosis after lung transplant...|$|R
40|$|The e-beam {{lithography}} {{is faced with}} increasing challenges to achieve a satisfying patterning of structures with critical dimensions of about 32 nm or below. The reason for this issue is the unavoidable blurring of the deposited e-beam energy due to beam blur, electron scattering (forward and backward), and resist effects. The distribution of the finally <b>deposited</b> <b>dose</b> differs from the dose weighted geometry of the printed layout. In general, the finally <b>deposited</b> <b>dose</b> is described as convolution of the layout with a process specific proximity function being {{a model for the}} unavoidable blurring. This process proximity function (PPF) is often approximated by a superposition of two or more Gaussian functions. Thus, the electron forward scattering and resist effects, being most critical to the pattern fidelity, are often described altogether by the so called alpha-parameter of the PPF. Due to these physical reasons, when the desired critical dimension of a structure is nea r or below the alpha-parameter of the PPF, it may be just impossible to print the structure because of the vanishing image contrast due to the blurring. It was shown by means of the simulation feature of the ePLACE data prep package that in this situation a modification of both the geometry and the dose assignment of the shapes will significantly increase the contrast of the deposited energy and thus, even preserve the printability of critical structures. This geometrically induced dose correction (GIDC) method is implemented in the ePLACE package. The simulation results for test structures are now validated by exposures of test patterns and its results clearly establish the practical advantage of the new method. In this paper we will publish the results of the related exposures - done on Vistec SB 3050 series shaped e-beam writers - demonstrating the practical importance of the GIDC method for layouts with critical dimensions of 32 nm and below...|$|R

(99mTc → 99Tc + γ) About 98.6% of these gamma decays result in 140.5 keV gamma rays and the remaining 1.4% are to gammas of a slightly higher energy at 142.6 keV. These are the radiations that are {{picked up by a}} gamma camera when 99mTc is used as a radioactive tracer for medical imaging. The remaining approximately 12% of 99mTc decays are by means of internal conversion, resulting in ejection of high speed internal conversion electrons in several sharp peaks (as is typical of electrons from this type of decay) also at about 140 keV (99mTc → 99Tc+ + e−). These conversion electrons will ionize the surrounding matter like beta radiation electrons would do, contributing along with the 140.5 keV and 142.6 keV gammas to the total <b>deposited</b> <b>dose.</b>|$|R
