5|$|In {{the waiting}} room outside the morgue, the doctor tells Buffy that Joyce died of an {{aneurysm}} suddenly and painlessly. Left alone with Buffy, Tara tells her that her own mother {{died when she was}} 17 and she went through something similar. Dawn goes alone to the morgue to see Joyce's body. While she is there, one of the bodies, now a vampire, gets up. After noticing Dawn <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> back, Buffy goes to look for her and finds her in the morgue, being attacked by the vampire. As Buffy fights and kills the vampire, the sheet falls from Joyce's face. Looking at her mother, Dawn asks where she went, as she reaches out to touch her cheek.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, the East African Monetary Union broke up, and {{the member}} {{countries}} replaced their currencies with the Kenyan shilling, the Ugandan shilling and the Tanzanian shilling, respectively.

25|$|In The Oxford Murders, a film {{adaptation}} of the novel {{of the same name}} by Guillermo Martínez, Wood plays a graduate student who investigates a series of bizarre, mathematically-based murders in Oxford. It was released in Spain on January 18, 2008. Wood also voiced the lead in the animated feature film version of the short film 9. A project in which Wood was set to star, a biographical film about singer Iggy Pop, putatively named The Passenger, <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> to fruition after years in development.|$|E
25|$|Such growth <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> without difficulties. There are {{questions}} {{as to how much}} more passenger growth can occur. The airport's present terminal and runway layout are reaching full utilization and PHL remains the world's largest airport without an inground fueling system thus requiring fuel to be trucked to each airplane. These two factors have led to congestion and delays. Additionally, the airport's parking facilities have been severely taxed. Exhaustion of all 17,000 parking spaces at the airport has become a regular occurrence. However, airport officials have ambitious plans for terminal and runway expansion.|$|E
25|$|Although the Latin {{original}} <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> down to us, {{we have in}} the Actus B. Francisci et Sociorum Ejus, {{edited by}} Paul Sabatier in Collection d’Études (Paris, 1902, IV), an approximation to it which may be considered on the whole as representing the original of the Fioretti. That Ugolino was the principal compiler of the Actus seems certain; how far he may be considered the sole author of the Fioretti is not so clear. His labour, which consisted chiefly in gathering the flowers for his bouquet from written and oral local tradition, appears to have been completed before 1328.|$|E

25|$|Since then, {{there have}} been several {{attempts}} to resurrect the line crossing the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The purpose of the project is to create a competitor to the overcrowded Panama Canal. It would be a rail line between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific at Tehuantepec, modernizing and extending existing rail lines. This type of project was initially proposed in 1980 again in 1997, 2006 and 2009. Versions of the project would have infrastructure built in Tehuantepec and in the nearby port of Salina Cruz. However, the project <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> to fruition with the main impediment being the large initial investment.|$|E
25|$|Like Hindustani and Carnatic systems, Odissi {{music is}} a {{separate}} system of Indian classical music and is having all the essential as well as potential ingredients of Indian Classical form. But it <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> to limelight due to apathy {{from the time of}} British rule in Odisha, want of its proper study, revival, propagation, etc. Despite the fact, the traditional music form could be saved and maintained in its pristine form. Thanks to the musicians particularly of Jaga Akhadas of Puri district, who could develop and maintain the music. The music movement of Odisha, however, took a different turn after independence.|$|E
25|$|Four runs are scored as overthrows if a fielder gathers {{the ball}} and then throws it so that no other fielder can gather it before it reaches the boundary. In this case, the batsman who hit the ball scores however many runs the batsmen had run up to that time, plus four {{additional}} runs, and it is counted as a boundary. If the ball <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> off the bat or hand holding the bat, then the runs are classified as 'extras' and {{are added to the}} team's score but not to the score of any individual batsman.|$|E

25|$|The term clone {{is used in}} {{horticulture}} {{to refer}} to descendants of a single plant which were produced by vegetative reproduction or apomixis. Many horticultural plant cultivars are clones, having been derived from a single individual, multiplied by some process other than sexual reproduction. As an example, some European cultivars of grapes represent clones that have been propagated for over two millennia. Other examples are potato and banana. Grafting {{can be regarded as}} cloning, since all the shoots and branches coming from the graft are genetically a clone of a single individual, but this particular kind of cloning <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> under ethical scrutiny and is generally treated as an entirely different kind of operation.|$|E
25|$|Fronsac is {{initially}} {{skeptical about the}} beast's existence, since survivors describe it as much larger than any wolf he has ever seen. However, by studying the bite size on {{a victim of the}} beast, he deduces that it must weigh more than 500lb (227kg). Captain Duhamel, an army officer leading the hunt for the beast, has killed dozens of ordinary wolves, but <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> close to the actual killer. While staying in Gévaudan, Fronsac romances Marianne de Morangias, the daughter of a local count, whose brother, Jean-François, was also an avid hunter and a world traveler, before losing one arm to a lion in Africa. Fronsac is also intrigued by Sylvia, an Italian courtesan at the local brothel.|$|E
25|$|After the {{transfer}} of sovereignty, Hong Kong faced a series of problems, both political and economical. The government carried {{out a series of}} reforms to adopt a more modern ideology and democracy, but faced many difficulties. Despite a transfer of power to China, the citizens participate in how their government is run, and the region maintains some degree of autonomy. Media in Hong Kong <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> under state control, though many citizens believe the media practices self-censorship. The economy would also begin the period with a rise in unemployment rate from 2.2% in 1997 to 4.4% in 2000, and 7.9% in 2003. The economy had gradually recovered since 2004 and the overall unemployment rate fell to 3.6% in 2008, however the overall figure rose again to 5.4% in 2009 due to the global economic downturn {{in the last quarter of}} 2008.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{they have}} written exhaustively on this topic, {{and their work}} did not reach us. There are many sciences. There have been {{numerous}} sages among the nations of mankind. The knowledge that <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> down to us {{is larger than the}} knowledge that has. Where are the sciences of the Persians that ‘Umar ordered to be wiped out {{at the time of the}} conquest? Where are the sciences of the Chaladaeans, the Syrians and the Babylonians, and the scholarly products and results that were theirs? Where are the sciences of the Copts, their predecessors? The sciences of only one nation, the Greeks, have come down to us, because they were translated through Al-Ma'mun's efforts. He was successful in this direction because he had many translators at his disposal and spent much money in this connection.|$|E
25|$|Within the adopted Unitary Development Plan, {{sites around}} Black Patch Park, {{near to the}} Soho Foundry were {{allocated}} for industrial uses {{in order to attract}} investment for a Technology Park. However, this <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> to fruition. A recent Employment Land Survey has revealed that there is no immediate need for further industrial land in this location. As there are no deliverable proposals identified, and to accommodate the wishes of Friends of Black Patch Park to retain the Park area, these allocations have been removed. The land will therefore form a green focal point for any development which takes place on the adjoining sites. The Preferred Option for land adjacent to Soho Foundry has been allocated for Mixed Used which can incorporate industrial and offices, and possibly leisure, community and educational facilities associated to the Foundry once a suitable re-use has been identified.

25|$|Some {{narrative}} {{history has}} survived {{for most of}} the Hellenistic world, at least of the kings and the wars; this is lacking for India. The main Greco-Roman source on the Indo-Greeks is Justin, who wrote an anthology drawn from the Roman historian Pompeius Trogus, who in turn wrote, from Greek sources, at the time of Augustus Caesar. In addition to these dozen sentences, the geographer Strabo mentions India a few times {{in the course of his}} long dispute with Eratosthenes about the shape of Eurasia. Most of these are purely geographical claims, but he does mention that Eratosthenes' sources say that some of the Greek kings conquered further than Alexander; Strabo does not believe them on this, but modern historians do; nor does he believe that Menander and Demetrius son of Euthydemus conquered more tribes than Alexander There is half a story about Menander in one of the books of Polybius which <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> down to us intact.|$|E
