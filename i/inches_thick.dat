5|$|The main conning {{tower was}} {{protected}} by 12 inches of armour on its sides {{and it had a}} 4-inch roof. The aft conning tower (sometimes called the torpedo control tower) had 9-inch sides and a 3-inch roof. The communications tube down from each position was 6 <b>inches</b> <b>thick</b> above the upper deck and 2 <b>inches</b> <b>thick</b> below it. Each magazine {{was protected by}} two armour plates on each side as torpedo bulkheads, the first one an inch thick and the second one and a half <b>inches</b> <b>thick.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is no {{standing}} {{fresh water}} on Caroline Island, although the Nake and South Islets harbor underground freshwater aquifers (or Ghyben-Herzberg lenses), and wells {{have been built}} to tap drinking water for temporary settlements. Soils on Caroline are similarly poor, dominated by coral gravel and sand, with significant organic content present only within stable, forested island centers. Guano deposits make island soil, where it does exist, nitrogen-rich; {{but even in the}} oldest and most vegetated regions of the atoll, soils are only a few centimeters (one or two <b>inches)</b> <b>thick.</b>|$|E
5|$|The stones {{themselves}} are small; on average they measure 0.1 metre (4 inches) in height, 0.3 metre (one foot) in width, and 0.1 metres (4 <b>inches)</b> <b>thick.</b> The largest stands approximately 0.5 metres (1.6 feet) above the ground. Most are incomplete, and likely {{have been broken}} since the original erection of the circle. Although {{it is not known}} if all the stones in the circle come from the same natural rock, a sample was taken from one stone and under examination revealed to be a hard, pale grey gritstone, likely taken from the nearby Pickwell Down grits. There are conspicuous quartz veins in many of the circle's stones.|$|E
5000|$|Wooden laths are narrow {{strips of}} straight-grained wood {{depending}} on availability of species in lengths of {{from two to}} four or five feet to suit the distances at which the timbers of a floor or partition are set.

40|$|The four {{connections}} for {{the control}} dewar and VLPC bayonet can platform are designed, using finite element analysis, to carry all dead weight and live loads. Based on the loads applied to the platform, two 1 <b>inch</b> <b>thick</b> plates and two 3 / 4 <b>inch</b> <b>thick</b> brackets made of ASTM A 572 -Grade 42 are required. The 1 <b>inch</b> <b>thick</b> plate requires a 3 / 8 <b>inch</b> <b>thick</b> intermediate steel material, between the 8 -inch x 4 -inch x 1 / 4 -inch boom and the plate, for load reinforcement as well as weld area reinforcement. Both the plates and the brackets require 3 / 4 inch steel bolt connections...|$|R
50|$|The {{outer shell}} of the torpedo was made of steel panels 3.2 mm (0.126 <b>inch)</b> <b>thick,</b> but 1.8 mm (0.07 <b>inch)</b> <b>thick</b> at the rear, welded and water-tight. The plates at the engine section were {{designed}} to leak water to cool the engine.|$|R
5|$|The {{inner and}} outer walls were {{constructed}} similarly with the outer wall measuring nine feet high and 18 <b>inches</b> <b>thick,</b> which was also coated in plaster. The outer wall {{is believed to have}} been constructed during the fifteenth century. The construction of the inner wall has been attributed to the Portuguese presence along the coast in the sixteenth century, whilst the presence of gun ports has been used to infer that the walls were not constructed earlier. However, the practicality of the walls as defensive fortification is unclear, since according to Kirkman the walls and gates surrounding the town have no significant strength, which seems to conform to a proposal that the walls and the layout of buildings were used to maintain social barriers. Although the inner wall has a more obvious defensive function and despite the absence of gun ports and the questionable strength of the outer wall, it has nonetheless been credited as being a fortification.|$|E
25|$|An {{emergency}} brake {{consisting of a}} piece of steel, around 1.5 <b>inches</b> <b>thick</b> and 18 inches long, which hangs under the car and is pushed into the track slot (the opening through which the grip reaches the cable) when the gripman pulls a lever. It wedges tightly into the slot and often has to be removed with a welding torch.|$|E
25|$|Of the carts, {{the main}} {{one was the}} plaustrum or plostrum. This was simply a {{platform}} of boards attached to wheels and a cross-tree. The wheels, or tympana, were solid and were several centimetres (<b>inches)</b> <b>thick.</b> The sides could be built up with boards or rails. A large wicker basket was sometimes placed on it. A two-wheel version existed along with the normal four-wheel type called the plaustrum maius.|$|E

50|$|Koloochehs {{differ in}} taste and {{consistency}} from region to region. Those from Fuman {{are larger than}} most other regions in Iran (approximately 4 inches in diameter and 1/2 of an <b>inch</b> <b>thick).</b> Iran's most famous Koloochehs come from Lahijan. Although recently additional flavors such as chocolate have been added, Lahijan Koloochehs traditionally come in Walnut or Coconut varieties and are approximately 2 inches in diameter and 3/4 of an <b>inch</b> <b>thick.</b> The Kashan Koloochehs are much smaller (approximately 1 inch or less in diameter and 1/2 of an <b>inch</b> <b>thick).</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{ship was}} {{armed with a}} main battery of eight /45 caliber Mark 5 guns in four twin gun turrets on the centerline, which were placed in two superfiring pairs forward and aft. The {{secondary}} battery consisted of twenty-two /50 [...] guns mounted in casemates {{along the side of}} the hull. As was standard for capital ships of the period, she carried a pair of [...] torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside. The main armored belt was [...] thick over the magazines, [...] over the machinery spaces, and [...] elsewhere. The armored deck was [...] thick. The gun turrets had 12 <b>inch</b> <b>thick</b> faces, while the supporting barbettes had 10 <b>inch</b> <b>thick</b> armor plating. Ten <b>inch</b> <b>thick</b> armor also protected the casemate guns. The conning tower had 12 <b>inch</b> <b>thick</b> sides.|$|R
25|$|Above that, {{there were}} the rudens, which were made of ten inches of rammed concrete.

Summa crusta of silex or lava polygonal slabs, one to three feet in diameter and eight to twelve <b>inches</b> <b>thick,</b> were laid {{on top of the}} rudens. The final upper surface was made of concrete or well smoothed and fitted flint.|$|E
25|$|Oversewing, {{where the}} {{signatures}} {{of the book}} start off as loose pages which are then clamped together. Small vertical holes are punched through the far left-hand edge of each signature, and then the signatures are sewn together with lock-stitches to form the text block. Oversewing {{is a very strong}} method of binding and can be done on books up to five <b>inches</b> <b>thick.</b> However, the margins of oversewn books are reduced and the pages will not lie flat when opened.|$|E
25|$|The two {{additional}} reactors, Indian Point 2 and 3, are four-loop Westinghouse pressurized water reactors both of similar design. Units 2 and 3 were completed in 1974 and 1976, respectively. Unit 2 has a generating capacity of 1,032 MW, and Unit 3 has a generating capacity of 1,051 MW. Both reactors use uranium dioxide fuel {{of no more}} than 4.8% U-235 enrichment.

25|$|The Germans {{had planted}} anti-landing {{obstacles}} {{throughout much of}} the area, mostly twelve feet wooden stakes, six <b>inches</b> <b>thick,</b> dug deep into the ground. These snapped off the gliders' wings and caused ground loops. Only 50 of around 400 gliders used were salvageable. Fortunately, damage to cargo and passengers was light – only about 80 casualties among the paratroops and about 150 glider troops, not counting 16 glider pilots killed and 37 injured. By 19:00 about 90 percent of the troops and equipment brought in by glider were ready for action.|$|E
25|$|The board {{submitted}} {{its final}} {{report to the}} Department of the Army on 20 August, and it reached the Secretary of Defense on 15 September. The report was a large document (two <b>inches</b> <b>thick</b> according to one source) containing a number of recommendations in keeping with McNamara's original charge. The centerpiece of the report {{were a number of}} proposed organizations that would make maximum use of both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft that were either in the Army's existing inventory or under development. The board also recommended that the number of aircraft assigned to existing Army units be increased.|$|E
25|$|Deep Diver was 22 {{feet long}} and 8.5 feet tall. It weighed 8.25 tons dry. It allowed one pilot and three {{observers}} to dive {{for a total of}} 32 man-hours to a depth limit of 1350 feet. The pressure hull was made of steel, 54 <b>inches</b> <b>thick</b> for the pilots' and divers' compartments. Deep Divers main hatch was 23 inches in diameter. The submersible featured no manipulators. It had twenty-one acrylic plastic viewports. The ballast and trim tanks provided 845 pounds and 676 pounds of positive buoyancy, respectively, when emptied. A large battery pod containing four battery banks could be jettisoned in an emergency, providing an additional 1500 pounds of buoyancy.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to using a steel casing, {{certain types of}} Wolf rifle cartridges use steel-jacketed bullets, which are often copper-plated and cosmetically similar to standard copper-jacketed bullets.

25|$|Over {{the course}} of a season {{creosote}} deposits can become several <b>inches</b> <b>thick.</b> This creates a compounding problem, because the creosote deposits reduce the draft (airflow through the chimney) which increases the probability that the wood fire is not getting enough air for complete combustion. Since creosote is highly combustible, a thick accumulation creates a fire hazard. If a hot fire is built in the stove or fireplace, and the air control left wide open, this may allow hot oxygen into the chimney where it comes in contact with the creosote which then ignites—causing a chimney fire. Chimney fires often spread to the main building because the chimney gets so hot that it ignites any combustible material in direct contact with it, such as wood. The fire can also spread to the main building from sparks emitting from the chimney and landing on combustible roof surfaces. In order to properly maintain chimneys and heaters that burn wood or carbon-based fuels, the creosote buildup must be removed. Chimney sweeps perform this service for a fee.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Serra {{made his}} first sculptures out of nontraditional {{materials}} such as fiberglass and rubber. Serra's earliest work was abstract and process-based made from molten lead hurled in large splashes {{against the wall of}} a studio or exhibition space. In 1967 and 1968 he compiled a list of infinitives that served as catalysts for subsequent work: “to hurl” suggested the hurling of molten lead into crevices between wall and floor; “to roll” led to the rolling of the material into dense, metal logs. He began in 1969 to be primarily concerned with the cutting, propping or stacking of lead sheets, rough timber, etc., to create structures, some very large, supported only by their own weight. His “Prop” pieces from the late 1960s are arranged so that weight and gravity balance lead rolls and sheets. Cutting Device: Base Plate Measure (1969) consists of an assemblage of heterogeneous materials (lead, wood, stone and steel) into which two parallel cuts have been made and the results strewn around in a chance configuration. In Malmo Role (1984), a four-foot-square steel plate, one and a half <b>inches</b> <b>thick,</b> bisects {{a corner of the room}} and is prevented from falling by a short cylindrical prop wedged into the corner of the walls.|$|E
