5|$|According to Hepburn (2006, pp.238–239), “it {{should be}} {{expected}} that <b>industry</b> <b>will</b> lobby furiously against any auctioning.” Hepburn et al. (2006) state {{that it is an}} empirical fact that while businesses tend to oppose auctioning of emissions permits, economists almost uniformly recommend auctioning permits. Garnaut notes that the complexity of free allocation, and the large amounts of money involved, encourage non-productive rent-seeking behaviour and lobbying of governments, activities that dissipate economic value.|$|E
5|$|Citing {{the limited}} {{size of the}} market as the main {{impediment}} in economic growth, Nurkse reasons that an increase in productivity can create a virtuous circle of growth. Thus, a large scale investment programme in {{a wide array of}} industries simultaneously is the answer. The increase in demand for one <b>industry</b> <b>will</b> lead to an increase in demand for another industry due to complementarity of demands. As Say's Law states, supply creates its own demand.|$|E
5|$|During the {{transition}} period participants in energy, fossil fuels and <b>industry</b> <b>will</b> only need to surrender one NZU for two tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. Free allocation of units to energy-intensive and trade-exposed activities will also be halved. Secondly, participants may pay a fixed price of NZ$25 instead of buying and surrendering units. This measure means that firms will face a cost of no higher than NZ$12.50 per tonne of emissions. There is a restriction {{on the sale of}} units oversea during this transition period, except for forest removal credits.|$|E

5|$|The production-possibility {{frontier}} can {{be constructed}} from the contract curve in an Edgeworth production box diagram of factor intensity. The example used above (which demonstrates increasing opportunity costs, with a curve concave to the origin) {{is the most common}} form of PPF. It represents a disparity, in the factor intensities and technologies of the two production sectors. That is, as an economy specializes more and more into one product (such as moving from point B to point D), the opportunity cost of producing that product increases, because we are using more and more resources that are less efficient in producing it. With increasing production of butter, workers from the gun <b>industry</b> <b>will</b> move to it. At first, the least qualified (or most general) gun workers will be transferred into making more butter, and moving these workers has little impact on the opportunity cost of increasing butter production: the loss in gun production will be small. However, the cost of producing successive units of butter will increase as resources that are more and more specialized in gun production are moved into the butter industry.|$|E

25|$|Ponce's {{agricultural}} economy and commerce gravitated around two main crops: sugar and coffee. The sugar <b>industry</b> <b>will</b> bring its collateral consequences: {{the establishment of}} a social framework based on slavery. In Ponce, more than any other region of the island, sugar and slavery were synonymous. By the time Salvador Vives died in 1845, after being city mayor three consecutive terms, slaves constituted 11% {{of the population of the}} island as a whole; in Ponce, they made up 23% of the population. As an example, slaves provided the main workforce at Vives' Hacienda Buena Vista.|$|E
25|$|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has {{produced}} several reports that have assessed {{the scientific literature}} on climate change. The IPCC Third Assessment Report, published in 2001, concluded that the poorest countries would be hardest hit, with reductions in crop yields in most tropical and sub-tropical regions due to decreased water availability, and new or changed insect pest incidence. In Africa and Latin America many rainfed crops are near their maximum temperature tolerance, so that yields are likely to fall sharply for even small climate changes; falls in agricultural productivity of up to 30% over the 21st century are projected. Marine life and the fishing <b>industry</b> <b>will</b> also be severely affected in some places.|$|E
25|$|Global {{insurance}} premiums grew by 2.7% in inflation-adjusted terms in 2010 to $4.3 trillion, climbing above pre-crisis levels. The return to growth and record premiums generated {{during the year}} followed two years of decline in real terms. Life {{insurance premiums}} increased by 3.2% in 2010 and non-life premiums by 2.1%. While industrialised countries saw an increase in premiums of around 1.4%, insurance markets in emerging economies saw rapid expansion with 11% growth in premium income. The global insurance industry was sufficiently capitalised to withstand the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and most insurance companies restored their capital to pre-crisis levels {{by the end of}} 2010. With the continuation of the gradual recovery of the global economy, it is likely the insurance <b>industry</b> <b>will</b> continue to see growth in premium income both in industrialised countries and emerging markets in 2011.|$|E

25|$|Thus, the Internet {{of things}} creates an {{opportunity}} to measure, collect and analyse an ever-increasing variety of behavioural statistics. Cross-correlation of this data could revolutionise the targeted marketing of products and services.

Big data and the IoT work in conjunction. From a media perspective, data is the key derivative of device interconnectivity, whilst being pivotal in allowing clearer accuracy in targeting.
