60|$|This {{passed as}} the two ladies were {{entering}} the house and preparing for the evening meal. The table {{was placed in the}} bay of the open window, and looked very inviting, the little silver tea-pot steaming beside the two quaint china cups, the small crisp twists of bread, the butter cool in <b>ice-plant</b> leaves, and some fresh fruit blushing in a pretty basket. The Holt was a region of Paradise to Phoebe Fulmort; and glee shone upon her sweet face, though it was very quiet enjoyment, as the summer breeze played softly round her cheeks and danced with a merry little spiral that had detached itself from her glossy folds of light hair.|$|E
6000|$|When I {{think of}} it many {{pictures}} come to mind--evening with the sea rolling high and waves curving shoreward in great dark ripples, that break and spread white and run up the strand. The sky is pale blue above, a green sheen low down, with white stars blinking. The promontories run down into the sea, sheer, black, rugged, bold, mighty. The surf is loud and deep, detonating, and the pebbles scream as the waves draw them down. Strange to realize that surf when on the morrow the sea will be like glass--not a wave nor a ripple under the gray fog! Wild and beautiful Clemente--the island of caves and cañons and cliffs--lilac and cactus and <b>ice-plant</b> and arbor-vitæ and ironwood, with the wild goats silhouetted dark against the bold sky-line! ...|$|E
6000|$|Réaumur, indeed, {{is said to}} have {{observed}} temperatures in slender trees nearly thirty degrees higher than the temperature of the air in the sun; but we are not informed as to the conditions under which this observation was made, and it is therefore impossible to assign to it its proper value. The sap of the <b>ice-plant</b> is said to be materially colder than the surrounding atmosphere; and there are several other somewhat incongruous facts, which tend, at first sight, to favour the view of some inherent power of resistance in some plants to high temperatures, and in others to low temperatures.[50] But such a supposition seems in the meantime to be gratuitous. Keeping in view the thermal redispositions, which must be greatly favoured by the ascent of the sap, and the difference between the condition as to temperature of such parts as the root, the heart of the trunk, and the extreme foliage, and never forgetting the unknown factor of specific heat, we may still regard it as possible to account for all anomalies without the aid of any such hypothesis. We may, therefore, I think, disregard small exceptions, and state the result as follows:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|On Thursday morning (October 25), after {{rolling through}} the night off the old port Eunostus, which now looks brand-new, we landed, {{and the next day}} saw me at Cairo. Such was my haste that I could pay only a flying visit to the broken beer-bottles, the burst provision-tins, the <b>ice-plants,</b> and the hospitable society of Ramleh the Sand-heap; and my many acquaintances had barely time to offer their {{congratulations}} upon the prospects of my [...] "becoming an Egyptian." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact I was walking at that moment in {{imagination}} with Mrs Bowater at Lyme Regis, but I seized the opportunity of hastening round from between aunt and nephew so that I could screen myself from the sun in Mrs Monnerie's ample shadow, and inquired why London gardeners were so much attached to geraniums, lobelias, calceolarias, and <b>ice-plants?</b> Mightn't one just as well paint the border, Mrs Monnerie, red, yellow, and blue? Then it would last--rain, snow, anything.|$|R
60|$|Helen sighed, {{but made}} no reply, as {{by this time}} they {{had arrived at the}} door of the room which she shared with Katherine. It was a {{complete}} contrast to Elizabeth's; it was larger and lighter, and looked out upon the bright garden, the alms-houses, and the church tower. The upper part of the window was occupied by Katherine's large cage of canary birds, and below was a stand of flower-pots, a cactus which never dreamt of blossoming, an <b>ice-plant,</b> and a columnia belonging to Katherine, a nourishing daphne of Helen's, and a verbena, and a few geranium cuttings which she had brought from Dykelands, looking very miserable under cracked tumblers and stemless wine-glasses. On a small round table were, very prettily arranged, various little knicknacks and curiosities, which Elizabeth always laughed at, such as a glass ship, which was surrounded with miniature watering-pots, humming-tops, knives and forks, a Tonbridge-ware box, a gold-studded horn bonbonniere, a Breakwater-marble ruler, several varieties of pincushions, a pen-wiper with a doll in the middle of it, a little dish of money-cowries, and another of Indian shot, the seed of the mahogany tree, some sea-eggs, a false book made of the wreck of the Royal George, and some pieces of spar and petrifactions which Helen had acquired on an expedition to Matlock with the Stauntons. The book-shelf, however, was to Anne the most attractive object in the room; and whilst Helen was untying the strings of her portfolio, she went up to it.|$|E

50|$|Based on the {{rehabilitation}} {{agreement with the}} government of India, a model village was to be rebuilt to its southern border. The villagers are of Latin Catholic faith and hence a large church which was a priority was built. A primary school was built to facilitate basic education. The houses were neatly built single bedroom on ten-cents of land consisting of a kitchen, patio, and a living room. They were aligned in thirteen parallel lanes, with sixteen houses (eight on each side) on a lane. A state-of-the-art water supply and distribution system was the attraction providing water for the entire village through two public taps in each lane. A police check-post was formed to maintain order in case people were not very comfortable with the packed nature of their new neighbourhood. A public transport main road with a designated bus stop provided access to the city. In order to aid the villagers who were dependent on the sea for their livelihood, an <b>ice-plant</b> and fish processing centre was built. For entertainment, a radio-kiosk was built and land was set-aside for resting at evenings. A market-place and a medical clinic was built at the centre of the village.|$|E
