40|$|This work {{presents}} {{an application of}} thin aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) films obtained using atomic layer deposition (ALD) for fine tuning the spectral response and refractive-index (RI) sensitivity of long-period gratings (LPGs) induced in optical fibers.

We correlated both the increase in Al 2 O 3 thickness and changes in optical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film with <b>the</b> shift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>LPG</b> resonance wavelength and proved that similar films are deposited on fibers and oxidized silicon reference samples in the same process run.

Given <b>the</b> non-analogue climate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>LPG,</b> {{a key question}} is how glacial pollen assemblages and thereby vegetation compare with modern vegetation. In this paper we present three LPG pollen records from the Carpathian Basin and the adjoining Carpathian Mountains {{to address this question}} and provide a concise compositional characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>LPG</b> vegetation. Fossil pollen assemblages were compared with surface pollen spectra from the Altai-Sayan Mountains in southern Siberia. This area shows many similarities with <b>the</b> <b>LPG</b> vegetation <b>of</b> eastern-central Europe, and has long been considered as its best modern analogue. Ordination and analogue matching were used to characterize vegetation composition and find the best analogues. Our results show that few LPG pollen assemblages have statistically significant analogues in southern Siberia. When analogue pairings occur they suggest <b>the</b> predominance <b>of</b> wet and mesic grasslands and dry steppe in the studied region. Wooded vegetation types (continental and suboceanic hemiboreal forest, continental taiga) appear as significant analogues only in a few cases during the LGM and more frequently after 16 ka cal BP. These results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>LPG</b> landscape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Carpathian Basin was dominated by dry steppe that occurred outside the river floodplains, while wet and mesic grasslands occurred in the floodplains and on other sites influenced by ground water. Woody vegetation mainly occurred in river valleys, on wet northfacing hillsides, and scattered trees were likely also present on the loess plateaus. The dominant woody species were Larix, Pinus sylvestris, Pinus mugo, Pinus cembra, Picea abies, Betula pendula/pubescens, Betula nana, Juniperus, Hippophaë rhamnoides, Populus, Salix and Alnus.

These results produce an important foundation of our further study of LPGP spectral characteristics. On <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above conclusion, a LPGP is produced by the amplitude mask method, in which the germanium-doped fiber is exposed by the UV. The LPGP's resonance wavelengths are shifted as <b>the</b> refractive index <b>of</b> medium surrounding <b>the</b> cladding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long-period grating. The sugar solution was experimentally measured, and results show that, this fiber-based device can rely on LPGP's the wavelength drift to differentiate solution's concentration based on their refractive index...|$|R
