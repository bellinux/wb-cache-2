5|$|The PowerBook100 had one {{external}} serial port, {{designed for}} use with a printer or any compatible RS-422 device. It was the first Macintosh to omit an external modem port, instead offering an optional built-in 2400 baud modem for communications. As a result, {{for the first time}} a user could not print directly and access AppleTalk or a faster external modem simultaneously, and devices such as advanced MIDI interfaces could not be used because they required the dedicated use of both ports. A third-party serial modem port could, however, be installed in the <b>internal</b> <b>modem</b> slot for consumers who needed traditional functions.|$|E
25|$|Although powerful, the <b>internal</b> <b>modem</b> was commercially impractical. Not {{only did}} it require special driver software, but a {{different}} hardware design was needed for every computer bus, including Apple II, S-100, TRS-80, and others. Some popular computers, like the Atari 400, did not even integrate internal slots. An obvious solution was to use the RS-232 serial port; modems were serial devices and generally driven off RS-232 anyway, and most computer designs included an RS-232 port, or some variant.|$|E
25|$|A further radical {{step was}} to abandon the 3Â½-inch floppy disk drive which had been present in every Macintosh since the first in 1984. Apple argued that {{recordable}} CDs, the Internet, and office networks were quickly making diskettes obsolete, however, Apple's omission generated controversy. At the time of iMac's introduction, third-party manufacturers offered external USB floppy disk drives, often in translucent plastic to match the iMac's enclosure. Apple had initially announced the <b>internal</b> <b>modem</b> in the iMac would operate at only 33.6 kbit/s rather than the new 56 kbit/s speed, but was forced by consumer pressure to adopt the faster standard.|$|E
5000|$|For <b>internal</b> DSL <b>modems,</b> Microsoft Windows {{and other}} {{operating}} systems provide interfaces {{similar to those}} provided for voice-band modems. This {{is based on the}} assumption that in the future, as CPU speeds increase, <b>internal</b> DSL <b>modems</b> may become more mainstream.|$|R
25|$|A key {{innovation}} {{required for}} the popularization of the BBS was the Hayes Smartmodem. <b>Internal</b> <b>modems</b> like the ones used by CBBS and similar early systems were usable, but generally expensive due to the manufacturer having to make a different modem for every computer platform they wanted to target. They were also limited to those computers with internal expansion, {{and could not be}} used with other useful platforms like video terminals. External modems were available for these platforms but required the phone to be dialed using a conventional handset, making them unable to accept incoming calls without manual intervention. <b>Internal</b> <b>modems</b> could be software controlled to perform both outbound and inbound calls, but external modems had only the data pins to communicate with the host system.|$|R
50|$|West's chief {{competitor}} {{in the legal}} information retrieval market is LexisNexis. Both Westlaw and LexisNexis started in the 1970s as dial-up services with dedicated terminals. The earliest versions used acoustic couplers or key phones; then smaller terminals with <b>internal</b> <b>modems.</b> Westlaw's terminal was known as WALT, for West Automatic Law Terminal.|$|R
500|$|Crystal Waters of Home Office Computing {{praised the}} PowerBook100's [...] "unique, {{effective}} design" [...] but was disappointed because the <b>internal</b> <b>modem</b> {{did not receive}} faxes, and the 100 had no monitor port. The low-capacity 20MB hard drive was also criticized. Once a user's core applications had been installed, little room was left for optional programs and documents. Waters concluded: [...] "Having used the 100 constantly {{in the past few}} weeks, I know I wouldn't feel cheated by buying it - if only it had a 40MBhard-disk drive option." ...|$|E

50|$|Apple {{introduced}} its first true modems in 1984, the Apple Modem 300 & 1200 modems (V21/V22). Prior to that they offered {{a third party}} Apple-badged comparatively low-tech acoustic coupler. Those were followed by the industry standard 2400/data and combined 9600/fax (V29) AppleFax Modem in 1987. Apple introduced the <b>internal</b> 2400 data/fax <b>modem</b> card for its Macintosh Portable in 1989 as well as released its last external desktop Apple Data Modem 2400. Only standard <b>internal</b> <b>modems</b> were offered during the 1990s through 2005, with the notable exception of Apple's foray into GeoPort passive telephony modems which relied heavily upon the computer's software and processing power rather than dedicated hardware (like Apple's proprietary <b>internal</b> Express <b>Modem).</b> The Apple USB Modem is Apple's first true external modem since the Apple Data Modem 2400 was discontinued in 1992.|$|R
5000|$|Improved connectivity. <b>Internal</b> <b>modems</b> and {{standard}} serial, parallel, and PS/2 ports on IBM PC-compatible laptops {{made it easier}} to work away from home; the addition of network adapters and, from 1997, USB, as well as, from 1999, Wi-Fi, made laptops as easy to use with peripherals as a desktop computer. Many newer laptops are also available with built-in 3G Broadband wireless modems.|$|R
5000|$|Initially, {{subscribers}} using {{personal computers}} accessed the Prodigy service {{by means of}} copper wire telephone [...] "POTS" [...] service or X.25 dialup. For its initial roll-out, Prodigy supported 1,200 bit/s modems. To provide faster service and to stabilize the diverse modem market, Prodigy offered low-cost 2,400 bit/s <b>internal</b> <b>modems</b> to subscribers at a discount. The host systems used were regionally distributed IBM Series/1 minicomputers managed by central IBM mainframes located in Yorktown Heights, New York.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first public}} dial-up BBS was {{developed}} by Ward Christensen and Randy Suess. According to an early interview, when Chicago was snowed under during the Great Blizzard of 1978, the two began preliminary work on the Computerized Bulletin Board System, or CBBS. The system came into existence largely through a fortuitous combination of Christensen having a spare S-100 bus computer and an early Hayes <b>internal</b> <b>modem,</b> and Suess's insistence that the machine be placed at his house in Chicago {{where it would be}} a local phone call to millions of users. Christensen patterned the system after the cork board his local computer club used to post information like [...] "need a ride". CBBS officially went online on 16 February 1978. CBBS, which kept a count of callers, reportedly connected 253,301 callers before it was finally retired.|$|E

25|$|The {{main problem}} with {{producing}} such a modem was forwarding commands from the computer. This could {{be addressed in}} <b>internal</b> <b>modems</b> that plugged directly into the computer's motherboard. Such modems {{had access to the}} computer's main memory, and by dedicating certain memory locations (or registers) to various status readouts or commands, software programs running on the computer could control the modem. This was a straightforward and thus a popular solution; the Novation APPLE-CAT II for the Apple II computer was an early programmable modem of this type.|$|R
5000|$|ZR-3500, {{similar to}} the ZR-3000, with new <b>internal</b> 14.4/9.6 kbit/s <b>modem.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{next major}} advance in modems was the Hayes Smartmodem, {{introduced}} in 1981. The Smartmodem was an otherwise standard 103A 300-bit/s direct-connect modem, {{but it was}} attached to a small microcontroller that watched the data stream for certain character strings representing commands. This allowed both data and commands to be sent through a single serial port. The now-standard Hayes command set included instructions for picking up and hanging up the phone, dialing numbers, and answering calls, among others. This {{was similar to the}} commands offered by the <b>internal</b> <b>modems,</b> but unlike them, the Smartmodem could be connected to any computer with an RS-232 port, which was practically every microcomputer built.|$|R

50|$|Amstrad also {{launched}} the SM2400 modem, {{which was a}} quad speed dial-up modem and boasted speeds of up to 2400 baud. It was an <b>internal</b> ISA <b>modem.</b> It was encased in plastic and could fit into Amstrad PC1512 and PC1640.|$|R

50|$|Peripherals: The {{basic unit}} includes: Built-in 300 baud {{telephone}} (POTS) modem (North American versions), Centronics-compatible parallel printer port, RS-232 serial communication port (sharing serial I/O chip with <b>internal</b> <b>modem),</b> barcode reader input, cassette audio tape I/O, real-time clock.|$|E
50|$|As {{well as the}} {{expansion}} box, an 80287 numeric coprocessor could be ordered as an option, and the memory could be expanded by 2 MB with another option to 3 MB. In North America, an <b>internal</b> <b>modem</b> was also available.|$|E
5000|$|Support for {{multiple}} instances. The drivers for many <b>internal</b> <b>modems</b> (typically Winmodems) cannot tolerate {{more than one}} of the same device inside a single computer. Symptoms of incompatibility include crashes, blue screens of death, or simple inoperability of all but a single modem. External RS232-based (serial) modems do not have this limitation because each modem contains its own microprocessor and is unaware of other modems on the same host. USB modems {{may or may not have}} this problem, because some USB modems are simply serial modems with a [...] "USB-to-serial" [...] converter chipset (in which case there should be no problem), and other USB modems are [...] "host-controlled" [...] and are essentially externally attached Winmodems (in which case the problem may persist).|$|R
5000|$|DSL routers, {{the most}} common form of DSL modem, are {{external}} to the computer and wired to the computer's Ethernet port or its USB port, whereas voice-band <b>modems</b> are usually <b>internal</b> devices installed in the computer itself in a PCI interface slot in the back. <b>Internal</b> DSL <b>modems</b> are rare but available.|$|R
50|$|The Apple USB Modem is a {{combined}} 56 kbit/s data modem and 14.4 kbit/s fax external USB modem introduced by Apple Inc. after the <b>internal</b> 56k <b>modem</b> was {{dropped on the}} October 12, 2005 iMac G5 revision. While it looks similar, {{it should not be}} confused with Apple's optional USB Ethernet Adapter accessory, available for its MacBook Air and MacBook Pro Retina range of laptops since 2008.|$|R
50|$|An <b>internal</b> <b>modem</b> can be {{installed}} on a single PC (e.g. on a PCI card), also allowing that single PC to connect to a WAN. Again, the PC can be configured {{to function as a}} router for a home LAN.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "MultiCAM" [...] module can be {{attached}} to the internal com port (disabling the <b>internal</b> <b>modem)</b> to enable the card readers to support multiple conditional access cards. Software support exists for many CA systems, including Conax used in Scandinavia ...|$|E
50|$|On modern {{machines}} without built-in serial ports, ZTerm {{can identify}} {{and use a}} wide variety of USB-based serial devices. The list of supported hardware includes the standard Macintosh serial ports and Geoport on pre-PowerPC G3 CPU PowerPC Macintosh computers, the built-in Apple <b>internal</b> <b>modem</b> slot and the USB ports on PowerPC G3, PowerPC G4, PowerPC G5 and Intel CPU Macintosh computers, and can be configured to work with adapters (including various USB port to serial port adaptors - such as those made by Keyspan, and Apple <b>internal</b> <b>modem</b> slot to serial port adaptors - like the Stealth Serial Port and the now discontinued Griffin Technology gPort, under OS X), giving it a unique use for BBSers and hardware tinkerers.|$|E
50|$|Winmodems {{have earned}} a certain notoriety for slowing down their host {{computer}} systems and for having buggy drivers, although this reputation was largely garnered {{during the period}} of their introduction to the mass market, whereupon they were apt to use substandard drivers and be found in entry-level computers with slow CPUs. Any such reputation has not, however, halted their market popularity; most <b>internal</b> 56k <b>modems</b> produced since 1998 have been software-based.|$|R
50|$|Apple {{introduced}} the Apple Modem on October 12, 2005 {{and removed the}} <b>internal</b> 56K <b>modem</b> on new computers. The MacBook Air, introduced on January 29, 2008, also omits a built-in SuperDrive and wired Ethernet connectivity that was available on all other Mac computers sold at the time. The SuperDrive would later be removed from all Macs {{by the end of}} 2016, while wired Ethernet would later be removed from all MacBook models.|$|R
5000|$|A {{fax modem}} enables a {{computer}} to transmit and receive documents as faxes on a telephone line. A fax modem is like a data modem but is designed to transmit and receive documents to and from a fax machine or another fax modem. Some, but not all, fax modems do double duty as data modems. As with other modems, fax <b>modems</b> can be <b>internal</b> or external. <b>Internal</b> fax <b>modems</b> are often called fax boards.|$|R
