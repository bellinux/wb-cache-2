25|$|Flash memory {{combines}} {{a number of}} older technologies, with lower cost, lower power consumption and small size made possible by advances in microprocessor technology. The memory storage was based on earlier EPROM and <b>EEPROM</b> technologies.

25|$|The first Soviet {{programmable}} desktop calculator ISKRA 123, {{powered by}} the power grid, was released {{at the start of}} the 1970s. The first Soviet pocket battery-powered programmable calculator, Elektronika B3-21, was developed by the end of 1977 and released at the start of 1978. The successor of B3-21, the Elektronika B3-34 wasn't backward compatible with B3-21, even if it kept the reverse Polish notation (RPN). Thus B3-34 defined a new command set, which later was used in a series of later programmable Soviet calculators. Despite very limited abilities (98 bytes of instruction memory and about 19 stack and addressable registers), people managed to write all kinds of programs for them, including adventure games and libraries of calculus-related functions for engineers. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of programs were written for these machines, from practical scientific and business software, which were used in real-life offices and labs, to fun games for children. The Elektronika MK-52 calculator (using the extended B3-34 command set, and featuring internal <b>EEPROM</b> memory for storing programs and external interface for <b>EEPROM</b> cards and other periphery) was used in Soviet spacecraft program (for Soyuz TM-7 flight) as a backup of the board computer.|$|E

40|$|We {{optimized}} thin reoxidized nitrided SiO 2 (ROXNOX) films {{produced by}} RTP {{on the basis}} of a careful analysis of the requirements of <b>EEPROMs.</b> The influence of oxidation, nitridation, and reoxidation parameters on charge-trapping and breakdown during a constant current stress was studied in detail. We show that avery light nitridation gives a maximum nitrogen concentration at the Si/SiO 2 interface and the largest increase in the endurance of the films under a high-field stress. The physical basis of these results is discussed. The improvement was confirmed on complete I kbit memory arrays produced with a 3 ~tm CMOS process with self-aligned contacts. Their lifetime was increased by at]east an order of magnitude, up to more than 10 ~ Highly reliable thin dielectric films are needed for ad-vanced integrated circuits, in particular, for electrically erasable and programmable read-only memories (<b>EEPROMs).</b> In addition to <b>EEPROMs</b> as stand-alone large-capacity devices, there is a need for such memories embedded in a wide variety of application-specific inte-grated circuits (ASICs) ...|$|R

25|$|The NAND type {{operates}} {{primarily in}} memory cards, USBflash drives, solid-state drives (those produced in 2009 or later), and similar products, for general storage and transfer of data.

25|$|When NOR flash was developed, it was envisioned {{as a more}} {{economical}} and conveniently rewritable ROM than contemporary EPROM and <b>EEPROM</b> memories. Thus random-access reading circuitry was necessary. However, {{it was expected that}} NORflash ROM would be read much more often than written, so the write circuitry included was fairly slow and could erase only in a block-wise fashion. On the other hand, applications that use flash as a replacement for disk drives do not require word-level write address, which would only add to the complexity and cost unnecessarily.|$|E

2500|$|The leading {{theory at}} the time was that the rover was stuck in a [...] "reboot loop". The rover was {{programmed}} to reboot if there was a fault aboard. However, if there was a fault that occurred during reboot, it would continue to reboot forever. The fact that the problem persisted through reboot suggested that the error was not in RAM, but in either the flash memory, the <b>EEPROM,</b> or a hardware fault. The last case would likely doom the rover. Anticipating the potential for errors in the flash memory and <b>EEPROM,</b> the designers had made it so that the rover could be booted without ever touching the flash memory. The radio itself could decode a limited command set – enough to tell the rover to reboot without using flash. Without access to flash memory the reboot cycle was broken.|$|E
