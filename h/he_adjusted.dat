5|$|The two clubs {{were due}} to meet a month earlier, but the stadium {{disaster}} at Hillsborough, which killed 96 of Liverpool's supporters, meant the fixture was postponed out of respect. It was moved to late May, days after the FA Cup Final which Liverpool won. Arsenal manager George Graham prepared for the match by giving his squad a minibreak and created a calming atmosphere in their training sessions. <b>He</b> <b>adjusted</b> his usual formation to a defensive one to stop Liverpool's attacking threat; David O'Leary was employed as a sweeper in a back five.|$|E
5|$|On June 25, 2015, Hardaway {{was traded}} to the Atlanta Hawks in {{exchange}} for the draft rights to Jerian Grant. Despite averaging 24 points in the Hawks' final two preseason contests, Hardaway was listed as inactive for the season opener. However, {{on the same day that}} they announced he would be inactive for the opener, the Hawks announced that they picked up the team option for the 201617 season. He was expected to battle Kyle Korver, Kent Bazemore, and Thabo Sefolosha for playing time as the season progressed. Hardaway also found himself competing with Lamar Patterson and Justin Holiday for time as <b>he</b> <b>adjusted</b> to his new team and their new gameplan. As a result, Hardaway did not debut with the Hawks until November 24 against the Boston Celtics in the team's 16th game.|$|E

In 1832, during his time as a surgeon-apothecary apprentice, he encountered a cholera epidemic {{for the first time}} in Killingworth, a coal-mining village. Snow treated many victims of the disease and gained a lot of experience. Additionally, while he was an apprentice, Snow could not drink, gamble or marry. Eventually <b>he</b> <b>adjusted</b> to teetotalism and led a life characterized by abstinence, signing an abstinence pledge in 1835. Snow was also a vegetarian and tried to only drink distilled water that was “pure”. Between 1833 and 1836 Snow worked as an assistant to a colliery surgeon, first in Burnopfield, County Durham, and then in Pateley Bridge, West Riding of Yorkshire. In October 1836 he enrolled at the Hunterian school of medicine on Great Windmill Street, London.|$|E

500|$|Bradman's game evolved with experience. He {{temporarily}} adapted {{his technique}} during the Bodyline series, deliberately {{moving around the}} crease {{in an attempt to}} score from the short-pitched deliveries. At his peak, in the mid-1930s, he had the ability to switch between a defensive and attacking approach as the occasion demanded. After the Second World War, <b>he</b> <b>adjusted</b> to bat within the limitations set by his age, becoming a steady [...] "accumulator" [...] of runs.

500|$|After {{programming}} a basic {{version of}} the CFDs model, Blackley used several programs to examine the simulated currents of air that flowed across {{a model of a}} flat plate. <b>He</b> <b>adjusted</b> the code until the plate fell realistically, and then constructed test models for a plane wing and fuselage. He eventually built a complete but dysfunctional plane by using data from [...] "pinhead books". By reading aircraft design manuals, he discovered that the problems were caused by his plane's incorrect tail and center of gravity. Following this, he created an exact three-dimensional model of the Extra 300S over roughly three days. As he had not yet simulated the physical attributes of its propeller, Blackley programmed the plane to be propelled from the rear. However, the accurate model performed properly in the simulated atmosphere.|$|E

500|$|Although Lichtenstein {{strove to}} remain {{faithful}} to the source images, he constructed his paintings in a traditional manner, starting with a sketch which <b>he</b> <b>adjusted</b> to improve the composition and then projected on to a canvas to make the finished painting. In the case of Whaam!, the sketch is on two pieces of paper, and the finished work is painted with Magna acrylic and oil paint on canvas. Although the transformation from a single-panel conception into a diptych painting occurred during the initial sketch, the final work varies from the sketch in several ways. The sketch suggests that the [...] "WHAAM!" [...] motif would be colored white, although it is yellow in the finished work. Lichtenstein enlarged the main graphical subject of each panel (the plane {{on the left and}} the flames on the right), bringing them closer together as a result.|$|E
500|$|Connie Smith's {{sound is}} defined by the Nashville Sound musical style, {{primarily}} during her breakthrough years in the 1960s. While most Nashville Sound recordings of the time mainly included full orchestras, Smith's sound remained more traditional with its use of steel guitar and her twangy vocals, while still featuring some pop-influenced instrumentation to provide urban pop appeal. Critics have largely praised Smith's use of the steel guitar, which have often been described as [...] "sharp" [...] and [...] "prominent". Smith's steel guitar player Weldon Myrick is often credited with creating what Smith has called [...] "The Connie Smith Sound". In an interview with Colin Escott in his book Born to Sing, Myrick recalls how Smith's producer (Bob Ferguson) wanted the guitar to sound, [...] "He came out and said he wanted a bright sound, and <b>he</b> <b>adjusted</b> my controls.

500|$|While {{many of the}} {{concepts}} for the final version {{were present in the}} original mobile version, such as Overdive and the Twisted, the original story was scrapped when the game changed platforms. In creating the story for The 3rd Birthday, the team took inspiration from the 10-year gap in the character's in-game and real-time history. This meant that {{it would be difficult to}} create a straightforward sequel, so the team instead decided to make the game about Aya's return. Toriyama imagined story concepts such as the snowy New York setting and the image of a bloodstained wedding dress. These two concepts survived the platform change. Over the course of the development, <b>he</b> <b>adjusted</b> the plot numerous times to be more adult-oriented and to include complex narrative twists. The original concept was to make the game feel like a television drama, with multiple cliffhangers and moments of high drama. The game was designed from the outset as having no direct connection to the previous Parasite Eve games. The game's title came from it being Aya's third video game appearance, as well as it being a noticeable change in setting. The game's logo was designed to both look like the letter [...] "B" [...] and the number [...] "3". It was originally only going to represent the number, but Nomura added the extra lines to display the game's [...] "multi-faceted" [...] nature. A notable addition was the option to skip cutscenes, a feature the team regretted leaving out of Crisis Core.|$|E
500|$|Loveless {{was largely}} {{recorded}} in mono sound, as Shields felt it {{important that the}} album's sound consisted of [...] "the guitar smack bang {{in the middle and}} no chorus, no modulation effect". Shields wavers his guitar's tremolo bar as he strums, which contributes, in part, to the band's distinctive sound. This technique—nicknamed [...] "Glide guitar"—causes the guitar strings to bend slightly in and out of tune. Shields said that due to his use of the tremolo bar, [...] "People were thinking it's hundreds of guitars, when it's actually got less guitar tracks than most people's demo tapes have." [...] The guitarist asserted that unlike other bands of the shoegazing movement of the early 1990s, My Bloody Valentine did not use chorus or flanger pedals. He insisted, [...] "No other band played that guitar like me [...] We did everything solely with the tremolo arm". Shields aimed to use [...] "very simple minimal effects" [...] which often were the result of involved studio work. He stated, [...] "The songs are really simply structured. A lot of them are purposely like that. That way {{you can get away with}} a lot more when you mess around with the contents". In a 1992 Guitar World interview, Shields described how he achieved a sound akin to a wah-wah pedal on [...] "I Only Said" [...] by playing his guitar through an amplifier with a graphic equaliser preamp. After recording the track, he then bounced it to another track through a parametric equaliser while <b>he</b> <b>adjusted</b> the EQ levels manually.
