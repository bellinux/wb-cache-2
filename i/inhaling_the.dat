5|$|Inhaling helium can be {{dangerous}} if done to excess, since helium is a simple asphyxiant and so displaces oxygen needed for normal respiration. Fatalities have been recorded, including a youth who suffocated in Vancouver in 2003 and two adults who suffocated in South Florida in 2006. In 1998, an Australian girl (her age is not known) from Victoria fell unconscious and temporarily turned blue after <b>inhaling</b> <b>the</b> entire contents of a party balloon.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} is not {{toxic to}} {{all forms of}} life. Its harmful effects are due to binding with hemoglobin so its danger to organisms that do not use this compound is doubtful. It thus {{has no effect on}} photosynthesising plants. It is easily absorbed through the lungs. <b>Inhaling</b> <b>the</b> gas can lead to hypoxic injury, nervous system damage, and even death. Different people and populations may have different carbon monoxide tolerance levels. On average, exposures at 100 ppm or greater is dangerous to human health. In the United States, the OSHA limits long-term workplace exposure levels to less than 50 ppm averaged over an 8-hour period; in addition, employees are to be removed from any confined space if an upper limit ("ceiling") of 100 ppm is reached. Carbon monoxide exposure may lead to a significantly shorter life span due to heart damage. The carbon monoxide tolerance level for any person is altered by several factors, including activity level, rate of ventilation, a pre-existing cerebral or cardiovascular disease, cardiac output, anemia, sickle cell disease and other hematological disorders, barometric pressure, and metabolic rate.|$|E
5|$|The decay {{products}} of 232Th include more dangerous radionuclides such as radium and radon. Although relatively little of those products is created {{as the result}} of the slow decay of thorium, a proper assessment of the radiological toxicity of 232Th must include the contribution of its daughters, some of which are dangerous gamma emitters, and which are built up quickly following the initial decay of 232Th due to the absence of long-lived nuclides along the decay chain. As the dangerous daughters of thorium have much lower melting points than thorium dioxide, they are volatilised every time the mantle is heated for use. In the first hour of use large fractions of the thorium daughters 224Ra, 228Ra, 212Pb, and 212Bi are released. Most of the radiation dose by a normal user arises from <b>inhaling</b> <b>the</b> radium, resulting in a radiation dose of up to 0.2millisieverts per use, about a third of the dose sustained during a mammogram.|$|E

A weakened Turbo Thunder reveals the second wand only opens underneath a secret cave, which contains magical wands and the final part of the cave prophecy: to find the ice wand. The group returns to Fairy World with the wands to free the imprisoned fairies before everyone heads back to Earth. The fairies arrive and use their magic to remove the Earth's metal casing. Timmy heads into space with the Destructinator following him; the Destructinator attacks him, which sends him {{back down to the}} Earth, at its north polar region. After Timmy tricks the Destructinator into <b>inhaling</b> <b>the</b> explosives, he reveals that he stole the detonator remote from him back in space and uses it to obliterate him.|$|E
25|$|During these rituals, {{the people}} are {{described}} to burn certain herbs, called Jop (yopo) and Osca (hosca; tobacco) in Epítome, <b>inhaling</b> <b>the</b> smoke and putting those herbs on the joints of their bodies. When certain joints are moving {{it would be a}} sign of luck in warfare and when others move, it means bad luck.|$|E
25|$|Once an {{eruption}} occurs, a large CO2 cloud forms above {{the lake and}} expands to the neighbouring region. Because CO2 is denser than air, it {{has a tendency to}} sink to the ground while pushing breathable air up. As a result, life forms that need to breathe oxygen suffocate once the CO2 cloud reaches them, as there is very little oxygen in the cloud. The CO2 can make human bodily fluids very acidic, potentially causing CO2 poisoning. As victims gasp for air they actually hurt themselves more by <b>inhaling</b> <b>the</b> CO2 gas.|$|E

It is commonly smoked in glass pipes made from glassblown Pyrex tubes and light bulbs. It {{can also be}} smoked off aluminium foil, which is heated underneath by a flame and the resulting smoke is inhaled through a tube of rolled up foil. This method {{is also known as}} [...] "chasing the dragon".|$|R

25|$|Fasting {{is often}} practiced prior to surgery or other {{procedures}} that require general anesthetics {{because of the}} risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents after induction of anesthesia (i.e., vomiting and <b>inhaling</b> <b>the</b> vomit, causing life-threatening aspiration pneumonia). Additionally, certain medical tests, such as cholesterol testing (lipid panel) or certain blood glucose measurements require fasting for several hours so that a baseline can be established. In the case of a lipid panel, failure to fast for a full 12 hours (including vitamins) will guarantee an elevated triglyceride measurement.|$|E
25|$|On 22 August 1985, British Airtours Flight 28M {{caught fire}} after an aborted take off at Manchester Airport {{while on a}} charter flight to the Greek island of Corfu. The fuel access panel on the aircraft's {{fuselage}} was pierced by {{a part of the}} compressor that had been ejected from the port engine {{as a result of a}} malfunction. The fire quickly engulfed the area around the rear of the plane filling the cabin with toxic fumes. Fifty-three passengers and two crew members died as a result - most of them dying of asphyxiation after <b>inhaling</b> <b>the</b> fumes.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} the {{practice}} of burning tobacco and <b>inhaling</b> <b>the</b> smoke (consisting of particle and gaseous phases). (A more broad definition may include simply taking tobacco smoke into the mouth, and then releasing it, as is done by some with tobacco pipes and cigars.) The practice was believed to begin as early as 5000–3000 BC. Tobacco was introduced to Eurasia in the late 17th century where it followed common trade routes. The practice encountered criticism from its first import into the Western world onwards, but embedded itself in certain strata {{of a number of}} societies before becoming widespread upon the introduction of automated cigarette-rolling apparatus.|$|E

25|$|Azelastine is {{safe and}} well tolerated in both adults and {{children}} with allergic rhinitis. Bitter taste, headache, nasal burning and somnolence are the most frequently reported adverse events. US prescribing recommendations warn against the concurrent use of alcohol and/or other central nervous system depressants, but to date {{there have been no}} studies to assess the effects of azelastine nasal spray on the CNS in humans. More recent studies have shown similar degrees of somnolence (approx. 2%) compared with placebo treatment. The problem of bitter taste may be reduced by correct application of the nasal spray (i.e. slightly tipping the head forward and not <b>inhaling</b> <b>the</b> medication too deeply), or alternatively using the azelastine/sucralose formulation.|$|E
25|$|Unanticipated fallout and the {{radiation}} emitted by it also affected {{many of the}} vessels and personnel involved in the test, in some cases forcing them into bunkers for several hours. In contrast to {{the crew of the}} Lucky Dragon No. 5, who did not appreciate the hazard and therefore did not take shelter in the hold of their ship, or refrain from <b>inhaling</b> <b>the</b> fallout dust, the firing crew that triggered the explosion was able to safely shelter in their firing station when they noticed the wind was carrying the fallout in the unanticipated direction towards the island of Enyu on the Bikini Atoll where they were located, with the fire crew sheltering in place ("buttoning up") for several hours until outside radiation decayed to safer levels. 250 rads were recorded above the bunker.|$|E
25|$|The active {{substances}} in tobacco, especially cigarettes, are administered by {{burning the leaves}} and <b>inhaling</b> <b>the</b> vaporized gas that results. This quickly and effectively delivers substances into the bloodstream by absorption through the alveoli in the lungs. The lungs contain some 300 million alveoli, which amounts to a surface area of over 70m2 (about {{the size of a}} tennis court). This method is not completely efficient as not all of the smoke will be inhaled, and some amount of the {{active substances}} will be lost in the process of combustion, pyrolysis. Pipe and Cigar smoke are not inhaled because of its high alkalinity, which are irritating to the trachea and lungs. However, because of its higher alkalinity (pH 8.5) compared to cigarette smoke (pH 5.3), non-ionized nicotine is more readily absorbed through the mucous membranes in the mouth. Nicotine absorption from cigar and pipe, however, is much less than that from cigarette smoke. Nicotine and cocaine activate similar patterns of neurons, which supports the existence of common substrates among these drugs.|$|E

500|$|The tunnels {{were the}} most {{difficult}} and time-consuming part of construction. Of the twenty tunnels, machines were only used for the Nåli and Vatnahalsen Tunnels—the rest were built by hand. Hand-construction was done by [...] drilling up to [...] through the rock, filling the holes with dynamite and blasting. Construction of [...] tunnels started in 1924 and the first tunnel was completed in 1926; the last tunnel was completed in 1935. On average, tunneling proceeded at between 116 and 180 man-hours per meter (35–55 hr/ft). The work caused death or lifelong respiratory problems through silicosis caused by <b>inhaling</b> <b>the</b> smoke. There were two fatal accidents, one in 1925 and one 1938, both related to tunnel work.|$|E
500|$|Following {{opposition}} to the potential of Edward's marriage to Wallis Simpson from the British government and autonomous Dominions of the British Commonwealth, the fort became the final setting of Edward's abdication as king. He held several meetings with Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin at the fort during the crisis, and on 10 December 1936 signed his written abdication notices at the fort, witnessed by his three younger brothers: Prince Albert, Duke of York (who succeeded Edward as George VI); Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; and Prince George, Duke of Kent. The following day, it was given legislative form by special Act of Parliament: His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936. Following his abdication at the fort, Edward described himself as feeling [...] "like a swimmer surfacing from a great depth... I left the room and stepped outside, <b>inhaling</b> <b>the</b> fresh morning air." [...] He retained the visitor's book from the fort, and it would grace all their subsequent homes.|$|E

She then wrote a damning paper on the effects of lower levels of sulfuric acid on humans, levels {{similar to those of the}} 1948 smog. The paper, and her attempt to present the associated findings to the American Industrial Hygiene Association, caused her many difficulties. Amdur was accosted and threatened by two thugs in an elevator at the [...] association's 1954 annual meeting. She {{presented the}} findings regardless. As Drinker received funding from ASARCO, the company's management assumed that they would hold sway over what was published. When Amdur returned from the meeting, Drinker demanded that Amdur remove her name from the paper and to withdraw it from The Lancet, despite the fact it had already been accepted. Amdur refused Drinker's demands, so her position on his staff was removed and she was left to find new work. The paper was never published.|$|E
