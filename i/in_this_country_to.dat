500|$|The first {{critical}} review of Very's book {{was written by}} Margaret Fuller and published in Orestes Brownson's Boston Quarterly Review; it said Very's poems had [...] "an elasticity of spirit, a genuine flow of thought, and unsought nobleness and purity", though she admitted she preferred the prose in the collection over the poetry. She mocked the [...] "sing song" [...] style of the poems and questioned his religious mission. She concluded: [...] "I am... greatly interested in Mr Very. He seems worthy to be well known." [...] James Freeman Clarke admired Very's poetry enough to have several published in his journal, the Western Messenger, between 1838 and 1840. William Ellery Channing admired Very's poetry as well, writing that his insanity [...] "is only superficial". Richard Henry Dana Sr. also commented positively on Very's poetry: [...] "The thought is deeply spiritual; and {{while there is a}} certain character of peculiarity which we so often find in like things from our old writers, there is a freedom from quaintness... Indeed, I know not where you would... find any thing <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> compare with these Sonnets." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{turning point}} came for {{development}} in the Everglades at the proposition of an expanded airport after Miami International Airport outgrew its capacities. The new jetport was planned to be larger than O'Hare, Dulles, JFK, and LAX airports combined, and the chosen location was [...] north of Everglades National Park. The first sentence of the U.S. Department of Interior study of {{the environmental impact of}} the jetport read, [...] "Development of the proposed jetport and its attendant facilities... will inexorably destroy the south Florida ecosystem and thus the Everglades National Park". When studies indicated the proposed jetport would create [...] of raw sewage a day and [...] of jet engine pollutants a year, the project met staunch opposition. The New York Times called it a [...] "blueprint for disaster", and Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson wrote to President Richard Nixon voicing his opposition: [...] "It is a test of whether or not we are really committed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> protecting our environment." [...] Governor Claude Kirk withdrew his support for the project, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas was persuaded at 79years old to go on tour to give hundreds of speeches against it. Nixon instead established Big Cypress National Preserve, announcing it in the Special Message to the Congress Outlining the 1972 Environmental Program [...]|$|E
500|$|After {{the repeal}} of Don't Ask Don't Tell on September 20, 2011, Obama {{included}} openly gay service members in her national military families initiative. On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never stated her position on same-sex marriage publicly. Senior White House officials said that Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life. Michelle {{went on to say}} that [...] "This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that." [...] At the 2012 DNC Michelle said, [...] "Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it... and he wants everyone <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love." ...|$|E

500|$|When studies {{indicated}} the proposed jetport would create [...] of raw sewage {{a day and}} [...] of jet engine pollutants a year, the national media snapped to attention. Science magazine wrote, in a series on environmental protection highlighting the jetport project, [...] "Environmental scientists have become increasingly aware that, without careful planning, development of a region and the conservation of its natural resources do not go hand in hand". The New York Times called it a [...] "blueprint for disaster", and Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson wrote to President Richard Nixon voicing his opposition: [...] "It is a test {{of whether or not}} we are really committed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> protecting our environment." [...] Governor Claude Kirk withdrew his support for the project, and the 78-year-old Marjory Stoneman Douglas was persuaded to go on tour to give hundreds of speeches against it. She established Friends of the Everglades and encouraged more than 3,000members to join. Initially the U.S. Department of Transportation pledged funds to support the jetport, but after pressure, Nixon overruled the department. He instead established Big Cypress National Preserve, announcing it in the Special Message to the Congress Outlining the 1972 Environmental Program. Following the jetport proposition, restoration of the Everglades became not only a statewide priority, but an international one as well. In the 1970s the Everglades were declared an International Biosphere Reserve and a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, and a Wetland of International Importance by the Ramsar Convention, making it one of only three locations on earth that have appeared on all three lists.|$|E

However, because the treaty {{made no mention of}} agricultural land, the California Alien Land Law - which regulated only agricultural land - did not ostensibly present an obvious conflict.|$|E
2500|$|Jimmy Manyi, ANC {{director}} general of labour and later ANC spokesperson, is quotes as saying the following on a TV interview: â€œI think its very important for coloured people <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> understand that South Africa belongs to them in totality, not just the Western Cape. So this over-concentration of coloureds in the Western Cape is not working for them. They should spread {{in the rest of}} the country ... so they must stop this over-concentration situation because they are in over-supply where they are so you must look into the country and see where you can meet the supply." [...] No action has been taken against Manyi.|$|E

2500|$|..[...] I {{have read}} some history, and I find that several {{countries}} have {{from time to}} time been afflicted with the same land disease as that under which Ireland is now labouring, and although the political doctors applied many remedies, the one that proved effectual was the tearing out, root and branch, of the class that caused the disease. All right-thinking men would deplore the necessity of having recourse <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> scenes such as have been enacted in other lands, although I for one will not hold up my hands in holy horror at a movement that gave liberty not only to France but to Europe. If excesses were at that time committed, they must be measured by the depth of slavery and ignorance in which the people had been kept, and I trust Irish landlords will in time recognise {{the fact that it is}} better for them at least to have this land question settled after the manner of a Stein or a Hardenberg than wait for the excesses of a Marat or a Robespierre.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, when {{delivering}} a public lecture {{in support of}} divestment, Tutu said [...] "My heart aches. I say why are our memories so short. Have our Jewish sisters and brothers forgotten their humiliation? Have they forgotten the collective punishment, the home demolitions, in their own history so soon? Have they {{turned their backs on}} their profound and noble religious traditions? Have they forgotten that God cares deeply about the downtrodden?" [...] He argued that Israel could never live in security by oppressing another people, and stated, [...] "People are scared <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> , <b>to</b> say wrong is wrong because the Jewish lobby is powerful â€“ very powerful. Well, so what? For goodness sake, this is God's world! We live in a moral universe. The apartheid government was very powerful, but today it no longer exists." [...] The latter statement was criticised by some Jewish groups, including the Anti-Defamation League. When he edited and reprinted parts of his speech in 2005, Tutu replaced the words [...] "Jewish lobby" [...] with [...] "pro-Israel lobby".|$|E
