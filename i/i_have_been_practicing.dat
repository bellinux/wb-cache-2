After months of hearings, an IAAF arbitration panel upheld the two-year ban on June 27, 2000. The Cuban federation continued to appeal his case, citing a clause in the IAAF rulebook that allows drug bans to be modified under [...] "exceptional circumstances". In a controversial decision announced on August 2, the IAAF shortened the suspension to one year - which had elapsed on July 30 - thereby allowing him {{to compete in the}} 2000 Summer Olympics. IAAF's motivation for this action was that Sotomayor had done a great deal for the sport, had passed hundreds of drug tests during his long career, and acted exemplarily throughout. Two weeks after his suspension was lifted, Sotomayor returned to competition at a small track meet in Montauban, France, which he won with a jump of 2.28 m. Four days later he won a Golden League meet held in Monaco by clearing 2.30 m. Interviewed on French television immediately after his victory, Sotomayor said: [...] "I was not fantastic today. I was very tired because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>practicing</b> a lot, and I also have a new baby since July, which is another reason why I'm a little tired. But I should be able to clear 2.36 or 2.37 at the Olympics. I just hope nobody else does 2.40." ...|$|E

Sitting to sing the Chöd practice they were approached by a young woman whose husband had been murdered. Neither of them had any experience dealing with funerals yet as dealing with the dead and especially those who died in unfavorable ways is strongly connected to Chöd they agreed.Traveling to a cemetery to the south they came across another wondering male Chöd practitioner. They then remembered Nyala Pema Dundel's prophecy that they would meet a Chodpa who would help them in Tsawa. On meeting them the Chodpa asked which {{one of them was}} Dorje Paldron?

My ability to write the sentence above with a straight face should indicate that I accept the possibility of a much larger and more complex energetic universe than is presently verifiable even by today's science.

Above all, the decline of their reading comprehension has been pointed out. On the other hand, universities in Japan are being evaluated on the basis of its educational practices and performances now. In my opinion, the so-called falling of children's scholarship reflects the decline of their life scholarship. "The life scholarship" is defined as the scholarship of effectiveness in everyday life.

I always desired to be in the medical field as I enjoyed science, problem solving, and interacting with others. I decided to learn more about what a PA does and if I could see myself becoming one. I began shadowing my now supervising physician in 2004. At the time, he had a physician assistant working with him, so I had the opportunity to observe their interaction, learn dermatologic terminology and procedures, and strengthen my interpersonal communication skills. I knew I could see myself {{as an integral part of}} the patient’s care and was determined to become a physician assistant. Once accepted as a dual admission student, my undergraduate journey began. I had a rigorous schedule for three years which included required science courses and honors program seminars. I was on the executive board of pre-medical clubs and was a peer tutor at Academic Services. It was crucial to have an organized and strict schedule, which I feel helped prepare me well for the challenging and intense coursework in PA school. Being a PA student taught me to persevere and gave me confidence to apply my knowledge when diagnosing and treating patients. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>practicing</b> as a physician assistant for over six years and still learn new things each day; about medicine, those I take care of, and myself.

The study is a presentation of my Professional Integration Project on NAIP-European Master of Music-program. I have had many different projects that will be presented. By playing, listening, and analyzing free improvisation I wanted to learn more about myself as a musician and about improvisation in general. I am also going to present individual exercises for improvisation I’ve been using, as well as exercises for group improvisation. I am going to present time-lines of events to see how one thing leads to another. I will present the product of a piece with improvised aspects, that led me and my collaborators to find our own ways of rehearsing. By summarizing the many aspects, I present my findings by describing what I want to learn, and how I want to learn it, and how I’ve been working with free improvisation groups and music collaboration, and what is important for me while performing improvisations. The findings of my studies suggest that I have developed my improvisational skills by playing free improvisation and doing exercises. My projects has also shown that you can combine written music with improvisational aspects in a classical setting by using different ways of rehearsing. Lastly, I found that it is important that, while improvising, musicians have a total mental presence to avoid energy loss in the music. Självständiga arbete, Master, 40 hp.

[...] The University of Georgia Law School Alumni Association has {{presented}} its highest honor, the Distinguished Service Scroll Award, to Bruce W. Kirbo, {{an attorney in}} Bainbridge, Ga., and John S. Noell, Jr., an attorney in Athens, Ga. The award is given each year to two individuals whose services to the legal profession and to the UGA School of Law are worthy of special recognition. The awards were presented during the Law School Association 2 ̆ 7 s annual breakfast held {{in conjunction with the}} Georgia State Bar meeting at Kiawah Island, S. C. on Friday, June 15, 2001. Kirbo is the senior practitioner in the South Georgia circuit. He entered the University of Georgia at the age of 16 and earned a law degree in 1951 at the age of 21. While at UGA, Kirbo made a mark as a student leader: {{he was a member of}} Blue Key and Gridiron, president of Demosthenian, and served two terms of service on the law school 2 ̆ 7 s honor court. He was admitted to the Georgia Bar just a few days after his 21 st birthday and, after two years of service in the military, began his successful private practice in Bainbridge. During his distinguished career, Kirbo has served as a member of the board of governors and other committees of the State Bar, as a special master for the Supreme Court of Georgia, as well as a member of the School of Law 2 ̆ 7 s Board of Visitors. He was inducted into the American College of Trial Lawyers in 1979 and is now a Fellow of the organization. Kirbo has also led a lifetime of leadership, service and philanthropy to his local community. He has represented the Decatur County School Board since 1979, served as a member of the executive board of the Bainbridge College Foundation, as president of the Kiwanis Club, as chairman of the First Christian Church, and as a Sunday School teacher. In addition, he and his brother, the late Charles H. Kirbo (a Distinguished Service Scroll recipient in 1978), were named chairmen of the Thomas M. and Irene B. Kirbo Charitable Trust in the 1980 s. That fund, named for his late uncle and aunt, has benefited numerous educational institutions, including the University of Georgia School of Law, where a total of more than 2 million presently endows the Charles H. Kirbo Professorship of International Law. The city of Bainbridge also has the Kirbo Trust to thank for its YMCA building. 2 ̆ 2 Today we honor Bruce, but in honoring Bruce, we must honor the entire Kirbo family, 2 ̆ 2 said Beaird. 2 ̆ 2 I cannot think of another group who, as a family, has served the university and its law school as this family has. 2 ̆ 2 Kirbo and his wife, Cass, have been married for 45 years. They have five children, all of whom graduated from UGA. Bruce Wheat Kirbo, Jr., a UGA law graduate like his father, now practices with his father at the firm of Kirbo 2 ̆ 6 Kendrick in Bainbridge. MORE SCROLL AWARDS, page 2 2 ̆ 2 <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>practicing</b> law for 50 years, 2 ̆ 2 said Kirbo upon receiving his award. 2 ̆ 2 I have had some good times and some hard times, but I have thoroughly enjoyed it. I appreciate the university. I appreciate the law school, and I appreciate every one of you. 2 ̆ 2 John S. Noell, Jr., a native of Thomaston, Ga., also earned both his undergraduate (1963) and law degrees (1965) from the University of Georgia. He was a distinguished military graduate of the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) and secretary/treasurer of his first-year law class. Noell served as a captain in the U. S. Army with the 9 th Infantry Division in Vietnam from 1967 - 2 ̆ 768 and received numerous commendations for service: Bronze Star Medal, Air Medal, and Republic of Vietnam Medal with Gold Star. He returned to Athens in 1968 and continues to practice there today with the law firm of Cook, Noell, Tolley, Bates 2 ̆ 6 Michael. Noell 2 ̆ 7 s excellence as a litigator has led to his election to membership in the Georgia Trial Lawyers Association and Association of Trial Lawyers of America. He served as president of the Athens Bar Association in 1976 - 2 ̆ 777 and taught trial practice as an instructor at the UGA law school from 1973 - 2 ̆ 774. Noell 2 ̆ 7 s service to the law school also includes leadership as president of the Law School Association (1992 - 2 ̆ 793), chairman of the Board of Visitors (1999 - 2000), ex-officio member of the Dean Search Committee (1992 - 2 ̆ 793), member of the Law School Bicentennial Celebration Committee, fund-raising class agent for four years, and chair of his Class of 1965 reunion on five occasions. He is also a member of the UGA Partners, the Presidents Club, Heritage Society and Joseph Henry Lumpkin Society - all among the most prestigious designations for financial support of the University of Georgia and its School of Law. Noell gives of his time and energy to the local community as well. He has served as past president of the local Chamber of Commerce, Lions Club, and American Cancer Society chapter. 2 ̆ 2 For the past 36 years, John Noell has been what a good alumnus should be - a lawyer generous with his time, generous with his leadership skills and yes, his financial support, 2 ̆ 2 said Callaway Professor Emeritus Verner Chaffin, Noell 2 ̆ 7 s former law school professor, who presented him with the award. 2 ̆ 2 [The law school] has not hesitated to place responsibility on John Noell and to let him know that we trusted him. He has always been faithful to that trust. John has done honor to the law school and all his fellow alumni by rendering service back to our community of scholars and the legal profession. 2 ̆ 2 Noell and his wife, Claudia Stowers Noell, have been married for 37 years. She is retired from the UGA Cooperative Extension Service and had served for 10 years as extension agent for Athens-Clarke County. In 1999, she received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from UGA 2 ̆ 7 s College of Family and Consumer Sciences. 2 ̆ 2 You don 2 ̆ 7 t know what you 2 ̆ 7 re missing as alumni until you get involved with the institution, 2 ̆ 2 Noell said in his acceptance remarks. 2 ̆ 2 I encourage all of you to take away from this meeting of the State Bar a renewed dedication to your law school. And it is your law school, and you have an investment in it. You need to make sure that you don 2 ̆ 7 t lose the opportunity to participate. 2 ̆ 2 ## PHOTO CAPTION: UGA Distinguished Service Scroll Presenters and Recipients (l. to r.)

It is through my personal difficulty in dealing with that event and the ensuing litigation that this topic became relevant to me. I am certain that there are others here today, or your colleagues, who have also experienced an adverse outcome. While I am not an accomplished researcher, published author, or medical-legal expert, {{it is my hope that}} the information shared today will help you in several ways; (1) to prepare you for the personal and professional stress reactions common to physicians who have had an adverse outcome and/or litigation, (2) outline steps you can take to facilitate coping with the stressor(s), (3) outline risk management principles to incorporate into your practice and thereby minimize your exposure to adverse events and their sequelae.

Qigong <b>is</b> a <b>practice</b> (exercise) that promotes well being and simultaneously makes the participant(s) aware of themsleves and their environment through the cultivation of Qi, or the life force medium. The need to organize vast deposits of information becomes the central preoccupation in our lives as we grow and evolve. Inevitably, mankind will need to economize his/her knowledge base. Qigong <b>is</b> a <b>practice</b> that, utilizing positive theory, seeks to understand man's interactivity within nature. This understanding may facilitate architects to make optimal predictions and design decisions as such. I believe that if carefully articulated, Qigong will prove worthwhile for its role in informing design. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> studying and <b>practicing</b> a form of Qigong meditative practice in my daily routine for health purposes. I am impressed with the results and think it may be valuable architecturally-possibly as an architectonic devise, discourse, metaphor, or design methodology. Qigong is an appropriate impetus for architectural design because it is an integrated science whose primary intent or essence is inward reckoning and personal balance. IntentI hope to manifest an architectural solution derivative of the process of Qigong meditation. I want to distill the phenomenon that accompanies the exercise and reformulate it, composing a space appropriate for several activities. I hope to design a space that not only resonates with the experiential qualities of meditation, but also to overlapp the meditative consciousness with other aspects of life, imbuing otherwise isolated habits and activities with meaning.

Tommy later quoted Billy's reminiscences of the informal sessions at the Cloughs' and others: When he lived at Blagdon, he used to bike down to Clough's. There were fourteen or fifteen pipers all living in that area, and they took turns to play at each other's houses, including Billy's. Billy told him that when he first {{went to one of}} these sessions there were fourteen pipers in the house, ..., and everyone was better than me! By God..., there were some good pipers. But all <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to dee <b>was</b> <b>practice</b> and get up alongside them. He learned by ear at this stage, and when he won a learners' competition in 1923, it was noted that he played the Barrington Hornpipe, but not quite as it is written. An early photograph of him from 1924, with a new set of pipes, <b>is</b> at; he <b>had</b> won a Learners' Competition organised by William Cocks in this year, when he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> playing {{for three and a half}} years. The pipes in the photograph are the set made by Cocks, and offered as a trophy in the Competition. Billy went on to win these pipes outright. After winning the Spencer Cup at Bellingham Show in 1928, Cocks recorded that he was debarred from most contests, 'to give other pipers a chance'. At this time he must certainly <b>have</b> <b>been</b> playing in the traditional staccato style characteristic of the instrument, though in later years his style was much freer.|$|R

The last 10 years has also seen {{the proliferation of}} digital culture and an increasingly weightless economy. This practice-led research project aims to reconcile the ostensibly archaic discipline of silversmithing, with a prevailing digital culture. An increasingly dematerialised world economy, focused on information and experiences, {{has led to a}} reduction in physical interactions and unique commodities. For film, music, software and many other products, the digital sphere has made it possible for an unlimited number of consumers to access the same item without the need for physical reproduction or distribution. Many of the most desired material goods are dependent on the fetishisation of brands over more tangible qualities. There are of course many great advantages to the super connected society. We are able to globally share information and ideas more efficiently. Access to ever cheaper or open-source technology has enabled previously marginalised people to participate in a collective progression of ideas. The democratisation of creative production, be that through digital photography, image manipulation, film or rapid prototyping, has established the notion that anyone can do it. The speed and ease with which making now occurs, from an unprecedentedly large portion of society, produces a vast amount of physical and virtual things. This provides great potential for innovation, but often tends toward speed and limited depth of enquiry. It could be posited that more is possible but less is known. In contrast to many products of the digital sphere, hand crafted objects made with traditional materials and processes are widely perceived to have an aura of authenticity. The act of physically shaping a material, of labor, is seen to imbue the artifact with substance and authority. The field of silversmithing holds a particular reverence. Silver is tangible, elemental and strongly material. It has physical, cultural and historical weight. Along with connotations of domestic, ornamental and ceremonial use, silver is a physical manifestation of financial wealth. However, {{there is a sense that}} as a discipline, silversmithing belongs to the past. It is the stuff of pre-war grandeur, heirlooms and sporting trophies. There are certainly instances of vital contemporary silver, but typically it is viewed as an antiquated field. This exploration is centered around the creation of physical, traditionally crafted objects inspired by a digital vernacular. More specifically, using hand-engraving techniques unchanged for centuries, to interpret digital images from the photo sharing application Instagram. Images are carved into found antique silver objects. It is an attempt to give a physical presence to some of the immaterial and ephemeral information that makes up much of contemporary interaction. At the same time seeking to create works with layers of history and a resonance with the present...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} {{five to ten years}} Professional Practices has become a {{required}} subject of study in most Australian university visual arts programs. If not a required subject, it is up there as an identified elective study. NAVA and ACUADS teamed up in 2001 to produce a range of topics, outlines and tutorial tasks for use by tertiary art lecturers to ensure that information given to students 'accurately reflects the realities of the industry姠These were available on-line from 2003 and revised again in 2007. The topics identified are very appropriate and the content is thorough and concisely organised. With the increase of commissioned reports and research projects into the visual arts and the widespread development of cultural policies, the problem is certainly not the availability of accurate, relevant information (as it once <b>was),</b> however, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come to believe there is another problem. From viewing university course outlines Professional <b>Practices</b> appears to <b>be</b> taught in very similar ways across art schools - general issue discussions complemented by visiting lectures on specific small business and art sector topics. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> teaching Professional <b>Practices</b> in Fine Art at QCA since it was introduced as required study eight years ago. In each year, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> looked for a different focus or central emphasis drawn from local or national events or developments, or changes in arts policies, or new publications. Each year <b>I</b> <b>have</b> shuffled the guest lecturers eliminating poor presenters and identifying better presenters. However, on reflection <b>I</b> <b>have</b> serious doubts as to whether this method of subject presentation is {{the most effective way to}} impart knowledge and professionally prepare students for the range of opportunities in the sector. This year (through a glitch in the system), <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a small group of 15 students enrolled in Professional <b>Practices.</b> It <b>was</b> a chance to embark on a very different way to deliver the subject. In this proposed paper I would like to discuss the approach I've used and to look at some of the results from the very open-ended assessment items I've set the students.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to {{identify}} {{the problem of the}} practice of undergraduate self-plagiarism. My interest in this topic was sparked following a situation I encountered while tutoring a first-year English composition student in Purdue University Calumet’s Writing Center. The student wanted to “tweak” a paper he had written in high school that earned him an “A” in order to resubmit it to his college composition class. I urged the student to write a new and original paper. I never did find out how the “potentially recycling” student proceeded with his writing assignment. He stated {{that he was going to}} “make some changes. ” Since then, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> researching the <b>practice</b> of self-plagiarism. I also presented a paper on self-plagiarism at the IWCA/NCPTW Conference in 2008 in Las Vegas, Nevada (Mendenhall). There are many questions regarding the extent to which self-plagiarism is ethical. However, it is not a topic that receives much attention. In fact, according to Lelia Green in a 2005 article in the Journal of Media and Culture, “Self-plagiarism is a relatively new evil – at least, few people in author’s circles appear aware of it. Googling the term results in some 8, 000 hits (whereas plagiarism alone scores 3, 150, 000) ” (Green). Since this particular subject can be explored in various aspects from the elementary school level through the realm of the academic published professional, this thesis focuses on self-plagiarism at the undergraduate level. It identifies the boundaries of what does and does not constitute undergraduate self-plagiarism, as well as establishes when and why it is acceptable and ethical. It also provides practical recommendations for universities, as well as administrators and educators of undergraduate English Composition in dealing with this issue and how to avoid it. This is of particular importance because the role of college writing classes is to help the student grow in his knowledge, thinking and reasoning processes, and writing skills. True self-plagiarism needs to be prohibited because the recycling of previous work causes a student to cheat himself of these educational benefits which will serve him well throughout life. ...|$|R
40|$|One day, I {{was sent}} a cryptic message {{out of the}} blue {{suggesting}} I should read The Story of Mimi-Nashi- Hoichi written in 1903 by the Irish/Greek writer Lafcadio Hearn also sometimes known as Koizumi Yakumo. This is a ghost story and features in Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things. Hearn recalls an encounter that befell the blind storyteller Hoichi who was particularly adept at telling the story of a sea battle between the Heike and the Minamoto clans in the straits of Shimonoseki, just off the Yamaguchi Prefecture in Japan. The entire Heike clan including women and children and their six-year-old infant emperor were all lost at sea. To this day the Heike crab found in this region <b>is</b> said to <b>have</b> human faces on their back and posses the spirits of the lost Heike clan. Blind Hoichi lived in a temple near by the cemetery that honored the names of the Heike lost at sea. One night he received an invitation to recite the battle of Dan-no-ura to the accompaniment of the Biwa to a distinguished high-ranking lord who would repay him handsomely for his performance. Hoichi’s disappearance each night eventually aroused concern in the priest who had him followed. Hoichi was found by the servants alone reciting the story amongst the cemetery of the Heike believing he {{was in the midst of}} a great performance to nobleman and samurai. At this point the priest realized that ghosts had bewitched poor Hoichi. The priest promised to protect Hoichi and proceeded to paint Hoichi’s body with magical kanji characters from a holy sutra that would render him invisible to the ghost and told him to await his visitor on the veranda but warned him to stay perfectly still and not to make a sound. Later that night the visiting lords messenger who couldn’t see Hoichi apart from his ears that the priest had failed or forgotten to cover in the sacred text visited Hoichi. Fearing returning to his master empty-handed the messenger decided to tear off the ears to take them back to his master. Hoichi felt his ears being torn off but remained completely silent until he heard the messenger leave and his friend the priest return who instantly realized the result of his error. Hoichi was never visited again but did receive great notoriety for recalling his own story and was rewarded handsomely by audiences that were gripped by his tale. On the same day of reading this tale for the first time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> working in the studio preparing for a drawing class and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> researching the work of Edouard Lanteri, particularly his plaster cast of an ecorche from 1908. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> recently acquired a copy of Lanteri’s cast of the anatomical study the year before with its missing left arm and peculiar pose of right hand grasping its head in a tortured fashion whilst maintaining a strangely elegant stance. Coincidentally, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> also <b>been</b> <b>practicing</b> with Lanteri’s method of modeling an ear in clay the same day. I began to imagine a hypothetical meeting that might have took place between Lanteri and Hearn about the moment Hoichi had his ears torn off and how this might <b>have</b> looked or <b>be</b> represented. What sort of image would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> conjured up at that point? How could Hoichi’s silent composure <b>have</b> <b>been</b> maintained through such fear and agony? The Battle of Dan-no-ura took place around 900 years ago and made me wonder how many times did the ghosts of the Heike clan visit the land of the living and invade the innocent mind of folk. I went to bed that night and had the strangest of dreams where Hearn’s Greek cultural background coalesced with Lanteri’s interest in classical sculpture and the agony experienced by Hoichi with the tortured soul in Lanteri’s ecorche. The role of the storyteller was mixed with the role of the artist. The ear conjured up half remembered half forgotten images of a scene in Blue Velvet (1986) a film written and directed by David Lynch and what ever happened to Van Gogh’s ear? It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> widely believed that van Gogh cut off his own earlobe and presented it to a prostitute on the 23 rd December 1888, who in-turn alerted the authorities the following day. According to new research by Hans Kaufmann and Rita Wildegans in their book Van Goghs Ohr: Paul Gauguin und der Pakt des Schweigens, published in 2001, what actually happened was a conspiracy concocted by Gauguin and Van Gogh to keep them out of prison and to cover up a fight between the artists that led to Gauguin slicing Van Gogh’s ear. Nevertheless this uncertainty between truth and myth reminds me of a friend’s favorite saying of ‘Never let the truth get in the way of a good story’. I would like to thank Martin Greening at Sculptured Art Studio (www. marble-sculpture. com) for his generous expertise and help in realizing this project. Andrew Sneddon, 2012 </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{presented}} and treated struggles for recognition and meaning among {{persons with disabilities}} and their families in a community on the Mexican south-pacific coast. For people with disabilities, their disability often becomes an imperative status, and they are classified as ‘disabled’, a label itself of recent historic origin. In this paper <b>I</b> <b>have</b> shown how much agency and creativity, strength and courage it takes for a disabled person to gain recognition {{with a variety of}} statuses, as a man, woman, husband, daughter, mother and father. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> focused on employed life strategies which give people social recognition as women and men. For many of the persons presented gender categories, which by others might be conceived of as constraining, seem to be cherished and esteemed. Such categories seem to be experienced as somewhat liberating or even empowering, in contrast to the label disabled. Embracing typically gendered ways of action seem to be secure paths for achieving social recognition, though the contents and interpretations of these ways vary a great deal historically and situationally. I discuss the etic/ideological pair machismo and marianismo, which I argue are relevant for the configurations of gender which we find in my fieldwork area. As Melhuus (1992), I find a mentality and practices dependent on the ideals outlined by Stevens (1973) as marianismo, to be pervasive among many of my female friends and informants, although they do not belong to the same socio-economic class as Steven’s sources did. Women are active agents, although many employ culturally pre-shaped modes of action and behaviour, primarily connected to the role of mother, the status which most entirely seems to determine women’s futures and options. In analysis <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> looking at <b>practices</b> of risk-taking and suffering, which I see as epitomes of machismo and marianismo respectively. Suffering, though an aspect of both men and women’s lives, seemed to be employed as a verbal strategy primarily by women. One can see more disabled men than women in Mexico, as in many other parts of the world. This is partially a problem of representation, but what I primarily wanted to point at, was the fact that more men than women end up injured or disabled as victims of accidents and social violence. I see this phenomenon as a manifestation of cultural models of male action, which seem to highlight variations of risk-taking as a manhood test. As Melhuus and others have pointed out; men are here traditionally valued in terms of masculinity, as much or less of a man, while women are evaluated morally, as either good or bad. These cultural stereotypical evaluations of women and men seem to be highly relevant for people in my field settings, though alternatives to hyper-masculinity and –femininity/motherhood do exist and develop. The rehabilitation centre Palapa Papaya, where I undertook fieldwork is one place where alternative gender relations are welcomed and played out. The centre also represents a level playing field where processes of recognition are enabled. As an institution Palapa Papaya is a multiple field, in which actual content and policies are changing. One aspect that remains is nonetheless the centre’s role as catalyst for change, in individuals’ lives, and increasingly in practices and attitudes of collective or cultural character...|$|R
