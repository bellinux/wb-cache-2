50|$|The tank {{container}} concept was also employed in Europe by Bob Fossey, an engineer {{who worked for}} Williams Fairclough in London. They improved on the 1950s framed American elliptical container tanks, oft noted carrying specified USA engine oils for the UK’s MoD aircraft built in Preston, Lancashire. In 1964 Fairclough made a swap body tank for combined transport by truck and train, but not yet constructed according to ISO standards. In 1966, commercial production began and one year later the first {{tank container}} to <b>ISO</b> <b>dimensions</b> was developed. The first mass-produced tank containers were purchased by Trafpak, a part of Pakhoed.|$|E

50|$|While no {{official}} engineering standard covers the process or format of tolerance analysis and stackups, these are essential components of good product design. Tolerance stackups {{should be used}} {{as part of the}} mechanical design process, both as a predictive and a problem-solving tool. The methods used to conduct a tolerance stackup depend somewhat upon the engineering dimensioning and tolerancing standards that are referenced in the engineering documentation, such as American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Y14.5, ASME Y14.41, or the relevant <b>ISO</b> <b>dimensioning</b> and tolerancing standards. Understanding the tolerances, concepts and boundaries created by these standards is vital to performing accurate calculations.|$|R

Current terminology of the United States armed forces calls these small containers Bicon, Tricon and Quadcon, which correspond with ISO 668 standard sizes 1D, 1E and 1F respectively. This {{comes down to}} containers of 8 ft height, and with a footprint size either one half (Bicon), one third (Tricon) or one quarter (Quadcon) {{the size of a}} standard 20-foot, one TEU container.At a nominal length of 10 ft, two Bicons coupled together lengthwise match one 20-foot ISO container, but their height is 6 in shy of the more commonly available 10-foot ISO containers of so-called standard height, which are 8 ft tall. Tricons and Quadcons however have to be coupled transversely — either three or four in a row — to be stackable with twenty foot containers. Their length of 8 ft corresponds to the width of a standard 20-foot container, which is why there are forklift pockets at their ends, {{as well as in the}} sides of these boxes, and the doors only have one locking bar each. The smallest of these, the Quadcon, exists in two heights: 96 in or 82 in. Only the first conforms to ISO-668 standard dimensions (size 1F).|$|R
30|$|Comparisons at {{a single}} time-point can be {{sufficiently}} good if peak values or stationary conditions are studied; however, {{it is not enough}} if two curves are to be compared. Peacock et al. ([1999]) have used functional analysis in order to quantify the agreement between different sets of data. Time series curves are treated as multi-dimensional vectors in functional analysis with each point in time defining an additional <b>dimension</b> (<b>ISO</b> [2008]). This makes it possible to quantify the length, angle and distance between two curves. This means that, in contrast to the qualitative comparisons, it is possible to compare different curves quantitative. Functional analysis has been used previously in evaluation of fire modelling (Peacock et al. [1999]) and in evacuation modelling (Galea et al. [2014]; Ronchi et al. [2013]). Functional analysis has also been included in an example validation procedure in ISO 16730 - 1 ”Fire safety engineering - Assessment, verification and validation of calculation methods” (ISO [2008]).|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} work, the forming limit curve (FLC) of a 1. 1 mm thick DP- 780 steel sheet is evaluated. The full FLC {{determination}} involved tensile tests of planar samples with different notch geometries – providing {{data in the}} tension-compression range – and Nakajima tests with a 40 mm diameter hemispherical punch and different notch geometries, covering the full loading zone of the forming limit diagram. The proposed Nakajima tool geometry reduces the standard test <b>dimensions</b> (<b>ISO</b> 12004 - 2) by 60 %. Results show that the reduced diameter Nakajima test, in the particular case of Dual-Phase steels, overestimates limit strains {{when compared to the}} tensile test. This observed difference is explained in terms of the presence of a strain gradient through the sheet thickness imposed by the 40 mm diameter Nakajima punch, leading to the conclusion that this reduced sample type is not suitable for FLC determination when the DP- 780 steel sheet is more than a millimeter thick...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFunctional {{tolerancing}} {{must ensure}} the assembly and {{the functioning of}} a mechanism. There are several types of functional requirements: mainly the assembly requirements which are {{expressed in terms of}} maximum material conditions and accuracy requirements that impose minimum material conditions. The approach consists of five steps: -Definition of each functional requirement by geometrical characteristics between some functional surfaces of mechanism and determination of the limit values of this characteristic allowing insuring the requirement with an acceptable risk, -Determination of the annotations of each part with the standards <b>ISO</b> of <b>dimensioning</b> and tolerancing, -Choice of the tolerances of each specification of each part, -Verification that the accumulation of the tolerances guarantees the respect for all the requirements, -Optimization of the allocation of tolerances to minimize cost or to maximize the capability of manufacturing processes. In this approach of functional dimensioning, the tolerance analysis is a very delicate stage {{to take into account the}} dimensional and angular effects. The problem is to ensure that the studied functional requirement will be well respected considering the tolerances on influential parts. The aim of this paper is to compare two methods of tolerance analysis of a mechanical system: the method of "analysis lines" and the method of "polytopes". The first method needs a discretization of the ending functional surface according to various analysis lines placed on the outer-bound of the face and oriented along the normal of the surface. For each analysis line, the result is the sum of the influences of each junction defects on the search characteristic using pre-established relations for classical types of junctions. The calculation is very fast and it can express the result as a formula according to the tolerances, if necessary with a statistical approach. The second method uses polytopes (finite sets of point in n). The polytopes are defined from the acceptable limits of the geometric deviations of parts and possible displacements between two parts. Minkowski sums and intersections polytopes are then carried out to take into account all geometric variations of a mechanism. Tools like OpenCASCADE have been developed to quickly realize intersections and Minkowski sums. This comparison is performed on a simple example specified with the method CLIC. The requirement is the assembly condition of a shaft in two bores of two different parts which involves straightness in common zone of the bores. Comparison of these results shows that solutions are identical. Assumptions and model behaviour bonds are also identical...|$|R
