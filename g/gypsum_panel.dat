50|$|Drywall (also {{known as}} plasterboard, wallboard, <b>gypsum</b> <b>panel,</b> sheet rock, or gypsum board) is a panel made of calcium sulfate {{dihydrate}} (gypsum) with or without additives and normally pressed between a facer and a backer (typically thick sheets of paper). It is used to make interior walls and ceilings. The plaster is mixed with fiber (typically paper and/or fibreglass), plasticizer, foaming agent, and various additives that can decrease mildew, increase fire resistance, and lower water absorption.|$|E
50|$|Flue-gas {{desulfurization}} (FGD) {{materials are}} produced by chemical “scrubber” emission control systems that remove sulfur and oxides from power plant flue gas streams. FGD comprises 24 percent of all coal combustion waste. Residues vary, but the most common are FGD gypsum (or “synthetic” gypsum) and spray dryer absorbents. FGD gypsum is used in almost thirty percent of the <b>gypsum</b> <b>panel</b> products manufactured in the U.S. It is also used in agricultural applications to treat undesirable soil conditions and to improve crop performance. Other FGD materials are used in mining and land reclamation activities.|$|E

50|$|Gypsum blocks {{combine the}} {{advantages}} of classical masonry with modern drywall construction. Similar to masonry, walls built with gypsum blocks are massive, void-free and of high stability. Because no mortar, sand or plaster are used, the walls are (almost) built without water, like drywalls. To distinguish this kind of construction from conventional drywalls with wall studs and <b>gypsum</b> <b>panels</b> or <b>gypsum</b> fiber boards, the construction with gypsum blocks {{is often referred to}} as massive drywall construction.|$|R
50|$|Ready-mixed joint {{compound}} is {{most commonly used}} in hanging drywall for new or remodeled homes. Application is simple and easy, usually never taking more than three or four coats. When used for new walls, {{joint compound}} effectively eliminates all blemishes {{from the surface of}} the drywall, such as fasteners, damage, or drywall tape. Joint compound is used to finish <b>gypsum</b> <b>panel</b> joints, corner bead, trim and fasteners, as well as skim coating. In addition, it is also very handy for fixing minor blemishes or damages to walls. It easily patches up holes, bumps, tears, and other minor damage.|$|E

Probably the figures represents prince Henry of Sandomierz and Kazimir the Just with their families. It is also a burial place of Henry of Sandomierz. The church with Slab of Orants was replaced in the 13th century by bigger, three-aisled basilica. Its remains are still visible in the vaults and are represented by decorative ceramic floor.|$|E
50|$|Drywall is made {{primarily}} from gypsum (CaSO4•2H2O). As its chemical formula shows, gypsum contains chemically combined water (approximately 50% by volume). When gypsum panels {{are exposed to}} fire, heat is absorbed as {{a portion of the}} combined water is driven off as steam. This chemical process is called calcination. The thermal energy that converts the water to steam is thus diverted and absorbed, keeping {{the opposite side of the}} gypsum panels cool as long as there is crystalline water left to be converted into steam or until the <b>gypsum</b> <b>panel</b> is breached. In the case of regular gypsum board, as the crystalline water is driven off, the reduction of volume within the gypsum core causes large cracks to form, eventually causing the panel to fail due to loss of structural integrity. This is similar to the cracking that can be observed in a dry lake or river bed.|$|E

Early trials (for example homes built by Levitt and Eichler, c. 1940-70’s) experienced failures in embedded copper and steel piping systems as well as failures assigned by the courts to Shell, Goodyear and others for polybutylene and EPDM materials. There also have been a few publicized claims of failed electric heated <b>gypsum</b> <b>panels</b> from the mid 90’s.|$|R
30|$|The low {{external}} natural {{dose rate}} is {{partly due to}} high attenuation of cosmic and terrestrial radiation by the 30 -cm concrete floors of the hospital. Owing to self-absorption, the thickness of the concrete floors (which also contain some activity) does not seriously affect the gamma exposure rate [9, 10]. As all internal partition walls are made of <b>gypsum</b> <b>panels,</b> little extra contribution to the dose rate from these is expected [9]. Moreover, some of the gypsum walls are clad with 2  mm of lead, also providing some additional shielding against background gamma radiation.|$|R

5000|$|Often {{referred}} to as drywall taping mud, joint compound is the primary material used in the drywall industry by a tradesperson, or applicator, called a [...] "drywall mechanic," [...] "taper," [...] or [...] "drywall taper." [...] A similar compound is used in various ways as a sprayed-on textural finishing for <b>gypsum</b> <b>panel</b> walls and ceilings that have been pre-sealed and coated with joint compound. The flexibility and plastic qualities of joint compound make it a very versatile material both as sealer or finishing coat for wall surfaces, and also in decorative applications that range from machine sprayed texturing to hand-trowelled or even hand-crafted and sculptural finishes. In North America the application of joint mud and drywall tape sealer and trowelled joint compound on gypsum panels is a standard construction technique for painted wall and ceiling surfaces. Until more recently in North America, and through the world, several different plasters such as veneer plaster and [...] "plaster of Paris" [...] {{have been used in}} a similar ways to joint compounds as fillers or for decorative purposes since ancient times, and the actual make up and working properties of these compounds is much similar.

The influences of eccentricity distance and height to thickness ratio on the bearing capacity of the compression wall panels were studied, and the failure mechanism and bearing capacity of compression wall panels were gained through the experiments of twenty-seven(nine groups) axial compression wall panel specimens and twenty-seven(nine groups) eccentric compression wall panel specimens. The analysis results indicate that the bearing capacity of compression wall panels is obviously affected by the eccentricity distance and height to thickness ratio, and there is a linear relation between bearing capacity and eccentricity distance. The bearing capacity calculation formula of the concrete-filled glass fiber reinforced gypsum wall panel is obtained by regression analysis, which provides reliable gist for structural design of concrete-filled glass fiber reinforced gypsum wall panel buildings...|$|E

The {{concrete-filled}} {{glass fiber}} reinforced gypsum wall panel {{is a kind}} of panel that the inside cavums of the glass fiber hollow <b>gypsum</b> <b>panel</b> is filled with concrete. The experimental results indicate that the concrete-filled glass fiber reinforced gypsum wall panel which has a better performance of the force and can be used to be the bearing wall of a building can form a novel structural system. When the beams supporting the wall panels, the wall panels which under the beams is in local state of compression. It were gained that when the wall panels are in the local compression state, local pressure loads are primarily borne by the concrete core columns and fiber gypsum board will damage in advance through the eighteen experimental wall panel specimens which in local compression. The test results show that the final destruction of the concrete is caused by being crushed and the contribution of the gypsum wall panel to local compression bearing is small. Compressive stress can only spread in the local loading on concrete core columns, cannot be expanded into an adjacent stud. Finally, the local compression bearing capacity calculation formula of the concrete-filled glass fiber reinforced gypsum wall panel is obtained by analysis of the test results...|$|E

50|$|Type C <b>gypsum</b> <b>panels</b> provide {{even greater}} fire {{resistance}} than Type X. As with the Type X panels, {{the core of}} the Type C panels contains glass fibers, only in a much higher percent by weight. In addition to the greater amount of glass fiber, {{the core of the}} Type C panels also contains vermiculite, which acts as a shrinkage-compensating additive that expands when exposed to elevated temperatures of a fire. This expansion occurs at roughly the same temperature as the calcination of the gypsum in the core. It allows the core of the Type C panels to remain dimensionally stable in the presence of fire, which in turn allows the panels to remain in place {{for a longer period of}} time even after the combined water has been driven off.|$|R

40|$|Alternative {{material}} {{for construction of}} walls is gradually coming to stay {{in view of the}} scarce nature of traditional concrete material that is often being used. In the choice of suitable alternative walling material such as Gypsum board presented in this study, parameter such as cost, durability, shelf live among others need to be considered. It is based on this premises that perspectives on effectiveness of Gypsum board over sandcrete blocks as walling material. The analysis of the primary data received through the administered questionnaires was done using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), a software package developed for data analysis. Ninety-five (95) questionnaires were distributed to various construction organizations. · The data was analyzed using the Mean Index Score (MIS) method of ranking. the research showed that the use of gypsum wallboard will be beneficial in terms of time, ease of construction and handling; it is not yet manufactured in Nigeria and will require some special training for manufacture and installation by local technicians or artisans. the research showed that the board is durable especially for construction of non-load bearing walls as it is not subjected to too much stress so it can last for very long periods. Nine, the research proved that the effect of the Nigerian weather on the board is minimal. The board panels are used for internal walling and are not affected by the sun or rain or extreme temperatures and therefore are not damaged easily. The board however is affected by the foundation on which it stands: therefore, if the foundation is stable, failure free and water free, the <b>gypsum</b> <b>panel</b> wall also remains stable and damage fre...|$|E

50|$|Sound damping {{tapes and}} other {{materials}} {{have been used to}} reduce both vibration and sound transmission through materials since the early 1930s. Although the applications of sound damping was largely limited to defense and industrial applications such as naval vessels and aircraft in the past, recent research has proven the effectiveness of damping in interior sound isolation in buildings. Constrained-layer damping <b>gypsum</b> wallboard <b>panels</b> increase sound isolation in building partitions by drastically reducing the vibration of panels and, incidentally, the radiation of sound through panels. The shear loading of a highly visco-elastic interlayer sandwiched between two more rigid constraining layers causes decreased displacement due to vibration, reducing the amount of sound energy radiated through a panel between enclosures. Damped <b>gypsum</b> wallboard <b>panels</b> are effective in reducing sound transmission over a broad range of frequencies and especially useful for achieving high levels of speech privacy between partitions.|$|R
30|$|In {{the field}} tests, {{it must be}} noted that the floor impact sound {{insulation}} performance of the voided slab systems was performed without any floor finishing material or covering. The floors of apartment housing in South Korea commonly use standard floor finishings and structures for interlayer noise prevention, which generally consist of <b>gypsum</b> <b>panels,</b> lightweight porous concrete, side insulation, and finishing mortar. Additionally, it is reported that carpets and other soft resilient floor finishing material, such as carpet with rubber underlay, would be useful for reducing the influence of impact sound levels. However, the floor of this field test was bare, which means the finishing material or any type of noise resilient layers would be applied on top of the voided slab system. If the floor impact sound insulation performance test could be conducted after applying the construction finishing materials on top of the voided slab system, the floor impact sound insulation performance might be slightly better than that of the bare floor without finishing.|$|R

40|$|In a fire scenario, {{huge amounts}} of heat are {{generated}} and high temperatures rapidly achieved {{in such a way}} that the integrity of structural materials becomes compromised. One of the aims of passive fire protection is the use of building materials that are able to absorb at least part of that heat and maintain the structural materials under critical temperatures for longer times in order to gain evacuation time. <b>Gypsum</b> <b>panels</b> are commonly used in building walls, but they only absorb heat at temperatures around 110 degrees C. We use three inorganic fillers, Mg(OH) (2), Ca(OH) (2) and CaCO 3, which undergo endothermic transitions at high temperatures to obtain an improved panel with a richer heat-absorbing profile. With this formulation, the time to reach temperatures of the order of 500 degrees C, critical for steel and reinforced concrete, is significantly increased. In this work, we focus on the kinetics of the endothermic fillers as an essential ingredient for further spatially extended simulations that include macroscopic heat and mass transfer phenomena or sample heterogeneities.

At the same time, {{the estimation of}} the airborne sound insulation of timber frame structures is a complex procedure which includes the prediction of several resonances and the analysis of a significant decrease of the transmission loss in the low frequency range. Three case studies are presented in the paper. The emphasis is put on the transmission loss in 1 / 3 octave frequency bands of double leaf structures with <b>gypsum</b> <b>panels,</b> wood studs and a well-damped cavity. Methods of Sharp and Davy are used for the transmission loss prediction. Particular issues are discussed for an asymmetrically sheathed timber frame structure, wood studs with resilient channels and staggered studs.

40|$|The growing {{necessity}} to save material and energy resources, {{together with an}} increasing concern over the environmental issues and uncertainties {{on the evolution of}} the economy, have impelled minimalist approaches to Architecture and Engineering. This created a new necessity for reducing, to the minimum necessary expression, the used building materials and elements. When analysing the overall material inputs of a building, it is possible to conclude that the interior partition walls have the higher contribution to the material inputs, when compared to other non-load bearing construction elements. Other aspect to highlight is that a great portion of building designs are not flexible in use and therefore buildings are not suitably adjustable to the permanent updating of life-styles and variations on the composition of the households. Although there are some lightweight building technologies, in most cases the construction practice all over Europe makes use of heavyweight and static partition walls. This paper will focus the advantages of lightweight partition walls and may contribute for the development of new partition wall technologies.

Apparently similar to wooden coffered ceilings, the <b>gypsum</b> <b>panels</b> in these ceilings have a bearing function together with the wooden framework and they present a very rich collection of decorations derived from the wood carving tradition. The issues on which this paper focuses are the analyses carried out by GIS data management, intended to improve our knowledge of the value of these ceilings. New information about their presence, state of conservation and reasons for their widespread occurrence are the basic pillars for planning possible conservation strategies. A first step in the analysis addresses the comparison of the similarities between ceiling decoration and certain traditional works of wood crafts found in the same area. The collection of data concerning the carved decoration of wooden doors between the 16 th and the 19 th centuries, together with the organization of a geo-referenced spatial database, has provided the opportunity to identify the presence of gypsum ceilings and carved doors in the same places and belonging to the same period. A second step deals with the meaning of these different kinds of spatial distributions.
