5|$|At Danvers State Hospital Southard met Myrtelle Canavan, {{with whom}} he worked and {{published}} in neuropathology {{for the next few}} years. When Canavan received a tempting job offer from the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane, in his capacity with the Massachusetts Commission on Mental Diseases, Southard petitioned the board to create a position for her as his assistant, and her salary was <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> refuse the Pennsylvania offer.|$|E
5|$|It was {{to prove}} this revolutionary {{technology}} that Dreadnought was designed in January 1905, laid down in October 1905 and sped to completion by 1906. She carried ten 12-inch guns, had an 11-inch armor belt, {{and was the first}} large ship powered by turbines. She mounted her guns in five turrets; three on the centerline (one forward, two aft) and two on the wings, giving her at her launch twice the broadside of any other warship. She retained a number of 12-pound (3-inch, 76mm) quick-firing guns for use against destroyers and torpedo-boats. Her armor was heavy <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go head-to-head with any other ship in a gun battle, and conceivably win.|$|E
5|$|The {{costs of}} keeping the women imprisoned in the tolbooth at Pittenweem were {{becoming}} prohibitive; on 12 August, after payment of five hundred marks, all the women except Cornfoot were released on bail. In September Morton was summoned to give evidence to the Privy Council but he had fully regained his health and displayed no symptoms of being possessed. Adam was questioned by the Privy Council in October and freed. In November, Laing, Lawson, Horsefoot and Wallace were released after paying a fine of £8 each; but {{the last of the}} accused, Cornfoot, was kept in solitary confinement in the tolbooth by Cowper. One of the prison guards, who perhaps felt sorry for her, put her in a cell with a window low <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> escape so she also gained her freedom.|$|E

5|$|As her fame grew, Coffin {{gained the}} {{opportunity}} to put her design principles into practice on a larger scale. Her practice had grown large <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> need an assistant by 1911, and by 1918 she had moved her office to larger premises at 830 Lexington Avenue. She also took on James Scheiner, an architect, as an associate. He became {{a key part of}} Coffin's practice, working on large-scale tasks such as overseeing work on the ground. This in turn opened up new opportunities for her to take on new, larger commissions. Coffin insisted on being paid the same fees as a male architect and to be treated equally in contracts; this was a novelty in itself, at a time when women were usually paid less than men. She also liked to employ women to work with her on commissions, giving them the chance to undertake apprenticeships that male prejudice had denied her when she had first started on her career.|$|E
5|$|Experts {{testified in}} court {{she also said}} she conversed with Lord Voldemort {{and one of the}} Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. On August 1, 2014, she was found incompetent to stand trial and her {{prosecution}} was suspended until her condition improved. On November 12, 2014, a doctor judged that her condition had improved <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> stand trial, and on December 19, 2014, the judge ruled that both girls were competent to stand trial. In August 2015, the presiding judge ruled that the girls would be tried as adults. They were tried separately. On August 21, 2017, one of the girls, now 15, pleaded guilty to being a party to attempted second-degree homicide, but claimed she was not responsible for her actions on grounds of insanity. Although prosecutors alleged that she knew what she was doing was wrong, the jury determined that she was mentally ill during the attack. She will spend at least three years in a mental hospital.|$|E
5|$|The {{employees}} pursue Michael, and {{he confesses}} that {{he created the}} rumors to conceal the one true rumor. Andy fears {{that it might be}} the one about him. The employees urge Michael to tell them which one is true, but just as Michael is about to give in, Jim announces that Pam is actually pregnant to save Stanley. Michael denies it, but Pam shows her baby's ultrasound picture to prove it. Later, while Michael discusses her pregnancy with Jim and Pam in his office, Stanley's wife Teri returns Michael's call from earlier. He picks up the phone with the intention of making an excuse for his earlier call so as to not tip her off, but he accidentally calls her Cynthia twice before Jim hangs up the phone for him. Teri had already been suspicious of Stanley and Cynthia, so Michael calling her Cynthia is <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> figure out what is going on. Michael, feeling guilty, watches from his office window as Stanley attacks Michael's car with a tire iron in a fit of rage. At the end of the episode, the three interns discuss what they have learned at Dunder Mifflin, which they essentially reveal was nothing.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1888, Eddowes, Kelly, and their friend Emily Birrell took casual work hop-picking in Kent. At harvest's end they {{returned}} to London and quickly went through their pay. Eddowes and Kelly split their last sixpence between them; he took fourpence {{to pay for a}} bed in the common lodging-house, and she took twopence, just <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> stay a night at Mile End Casual Ward in the neighbouring parish.|$|E
25|$|Berkowitz {{claimed that}} his first attack was {{committed}} on Christmas Eve, 1975, when he used a hunting knife to stab two women. One alleged victim was never identified by police, but the other was teenager Michelle Forman, whose injuries were serious <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be hospitalized. Berkowitz was not suspected of these crimes, and soon afterward he relocated to an apartment in Yonkers, New York, just slightly north of the New York City borderline.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} 12 December that Howard {{formally}} conceded defeat, with the Electoral Commission formally declaring McKew the winner by 44,685 votes (51.4 percent) to Howard's 42,251 (48.6 percent). The final tally indicated that McKew had won victory on the 14th count due to a large flow of Green preferences to her; 3,793 (78.84 percent) of Green voters listed McKew as their second preference. This was <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> defeat Howard by 2.8 percentage points on the two-party vote.|$|E
25|$|With {{the release}} of the new album, the group {{announced}} a tour which was to include dates in Europe, parts of the UK, and North America. The shows were scheduled in smaller venues, with live orchestral accompaniment. However, in May 2017, shortly into the European tour, The Cranberries had to cancel the remainder of the European dates as O’Riordan had health issues. The North American tour dates were cancelled in July when her recovery had not progressed <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> participate. , no new or rescheduled tour dates were announced.|$|E
25|$|Hearst's {{attorney}} F. Lee Bailey {{used the}} Stockholm Syndrome argument {{as part of}} the defense at trial. During Hearst's subsequent trial, her lawyer claimed that she had been confined in a closet barely large <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> lie down in; that her {{contact with the outside world}} was regulated by her captors; and that she was regularly threatened with execution. Hearst's lawyer contended that she had been raped by DeFreeze and Wolfe. Both died before Hearst's capture and trial. The SLA claimed to be holding Hearst according to the conditions of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E
50|$|The story {{involves}} flashbacks, {{and in one}} sequence {{we learn}} that Camille's parents are feuding. Illogically, she tries to persuade them <b>to</b> reunite long <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> conception <b>to</b> take place. The surreal plot and series of stylized scenes {{is in keeping with}} postmodern cinema, which challenges the notion of original creative thought.|$|R

25|$|After {{the capture}} of Peking by the foreign armies, some of Empress Dowager Cixi's {{advisers}} advocated that the war be carried on, arguing that China could have defeated the foreigners as it was disloyal and traitorous people within China who allowed Beijing and Tianjin to be captured by the Allies, and that the interior of China was impenetrable. They also recommended that Dong Fuxiang continue fighting. The Empress Dowager Cixi was practical, however, and decided that the terms were generous <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> acquiesce when she was assured of her continued reign {{after the war and}} that China would not be forced to cede any territory.|$|E
25|$|Fern's first book, Fern Leaves (1853), was a best seller. It sold 46,000 {{copies in}} the first four months, and over 70,000 copies the first year. She {{received}} ten cents a copy in royalties, <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> buy a house in Brooklyn and live comfortably. Three years into her career, in 1855 she was earning $100 a week for her column in the New York Ledger, making her the highest-paid columnist in the United States. Her first regular column appeared on January 5, 1856, and would run weekly, without exception, until October 12, 1872, when the last edition was printed two days after her death.|$|E
25|$|The Qing dynasty was by {{no means}} {{defeated}} when the Allies took control of Beijing. The Allies had to temper the demands they sent in a message to Xi'an to get the Dowager Empress to agree with them; for instance, China did not have to give up any land. Many of the Dowager Empress's advisers in the Imperial Court insisted that the war be carried on against the foreigners, arguing that China could defeat the foreigners since it was the disloyal and traitorous people within China who allowed Beijing and Tianjin to be captured by the Allies, and the interior of China was impenetrable. The Dowager was practical, and decided that the terms were generous <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> acquiesce and stop the war, when she was assured of her continued reign after the war.|$|E
5000|$|... "Hearts and Flowers" [...] was {{not only}} heard in theater as accompaniment to films, but played an {{integral}} part of on-set music for actors. Viola Dana famously requested the tune to be played in order <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> generate <b>enough</b> emotion <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> cry real tears. This was later parodied in the 1928 film Show People with Marion Davies.|$|R

25|$|Merman's health {{eventually}} stabilized <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{be brought}} back to her apartment in Manhattan. Her son hired a healer {{who was able to}} reduce the size of Merman's tumor by a third. However, Merman began to refuse to see the healer and her health began to decline. On February 15, 1984, 10 months after she was diagnosed with brain cancer, Merman died at her home in Manhattan at the age of 76. On the evening of Merman's death, all 36 theatres on Broadway dimmed their lights at 9 pm in her honor. A private funeral service for Merman was held in a chapel at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church on February 27, after which Merman was cremated at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel. In accordance with her wishes, Merman's remains were given to her son Robert, Jr. Merman was interred in the Shrine of Remembrance Mausoleum in Colorado Springs, Colorado, next to her daughter Ethel.|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s, Aimé Dupont began {{suffering}} from stomach cancer. Just {{prior to a}} sitting with Emma Eames, he fell ill {{and was unable to}} work. Despite never having done photography work before, Etta Dupont stepped in and successfully kept the appointment. From then on, she would be responsible for posing the subjects. Dupont died of his condition on 16 February 1900. Afterwards, Etta became the photographer for the business (and in later years, their son Albert also took his turn behind the camera), keeping the name Aimé Dupont Studio. For many years, a number of the photographic subjects were under the belief that she was Aimé Dupont. Her endeavors proved to be successful <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> open another studio in Newport, Rhode Island, photographing socialites when she closed the New York studio for the summers. However, in 1906 the Metropolitan Opera, the studio's primary client, hired its own photographer, and without the artistic direction of Dupont, the business began to suffer. Finally, in 1920, Etta had to declare bankruptcy. She sold the business to an investor, and the name Aimé Dupont Studio continued as a portrait studio until the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|During the Battle of Beijing, {{the entire}} {{imperial}} court, including Empress Dowager Cixi and the Guangxu Emperor, fled Beijing and evacuated to Xi'an as the allied forced invaded the city. After {{the fall of}} Beijing, the Eight-Nation Alliance negotiated a treaty with the Qing government, sending messengers to the empress dowager in Xi'an. Included {{in the terms of}} the agreement was a guarantee that China would not have to give up any further territories to foreign powers. Many of Cixi's advisers in the imperial court insisted that the war against the foreigners be continued. They recommended that Dong Fuxiang be given responsibility to continue the war effort. Cixi was practical, however, and decided that the terms were generous <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> acquiesce and stop the war, at least after she was assured of her continued reign when the war was concluded. The Western powers needed a government strong enough to suppress further anti-foreign movements, but too weak to act on its own; they supported the continuation of the Qing dynasty, rather than allowing it to be overthrown. Cixi turned once more to Li Hongzhang to negotiate. Li agreed to sign the Boxer Protocol, which stipulated the presence of an international military force in Beijing and the payment of £67million (almost $333million) in war reparations. The United States used its share of the war indemnity to fund the creation of China's prestigious Tsinghua University. The Guangxu Emperor and Cixi did not return to Beijing from Xi'an until roughly 18 months after their flight.|$|E
