40|$|Spatial {{contacts}} among {{human beings}} are considered {{as one of the}} influential factors during the transmission of contagious diseases, such as influenza and tuberculosis. Therefore, representing and understanding spatial contacts {{plays an important role in}} epidemic modeling research. However, most current research only considers regular spatial contacts such as contacts at home/school/office, or they assume static social networks for modeling social <b>contacts</b> and omit <b>travel</b> <b>contacts</b> in their epidemic models. This paper describes a way to model relatively complete spatial contacts in the context of a large-scale artificial city, which combines different data sources to construct an agent-based model of the city Beijing. In this model, agents have regular contacts when executing their daily activity patterns which is similar to other large-scale agent-based epidemic models. Besides, a microscopic public transportation component is included in the artificial city to model public <b>travel</b> <b>contacts.</b> Moreover, social contacts also emerge in this model due to the dynamic generation of social networks. To systematically examine the effect of the relatively complete spatial contacts have for epidemic prediction in the artificial city, a pandemic influenza disease progression model was implemented in this artificial city. The simulation results validated the model. In addition, the way to model spatial contacts in this paper shows potential not only for improving comprehension of disease spread dynamics, but also for use in other social systems, such as public transportation systems and city level evacuation planning.

This paper identifies a travel health issue in need of more attention, illustrated by a wide range of practical problems that <b>travelling</b> <b>contact</b> lens wearers face.

50|$|Two or {{more players}} are {{represented}} by dual-wheeled motor vehicles, or light cycles, in a grid-lined arena. The vehicles constantly move forward, leaving a coloured trail behind them as they <b>travel.</b> <b>Contact</b> with either the arena walls or a trail left by a player will result in death and elimination from the battle (not only does this remove their trail entirely, the explosion also breaches trails a short distance away). Therefore, players attempt to box each other in order to force their opponents to touch their trail {{or one of the}} arena walls. Players can change the direction of movement, by turning 90 degrees to the left or right (though in some servers the number of axes is more than four, making it possible to turn 45 degrees, or none at all).|$|R

The double TSP with multiple stacks {{is concerned with}} determining the shortest route performing pickups and deliveries in two separated networks (one for pickups and one for deliveries) using only one container. Repacking is not allowed, instead each item can be positioned in one of several rows in the container, such that each row {{can be considered a}} LIFO (last in, first out) stack, but no mutual constraints exist between the rows. Two different neighbourhood structures are developed for the problem and used with each of three local search metaheuristics. Additionally some simpler removal and reinsertion operators are used in a Large neighbourhood search framework. Finally some computational results are given along with lower bounds on the objective value. Routing Packing Metaheuristics TSP variants...|$|R

5000|$|Grain {{undergoes}} {{free fall}} during many handling processes. For example, grain is conveyed {{out of the}} combine and dropped into some other storage device, usually a grain cart or semi. It also undergoes free fall when unloaded into bins or silos. Grain can be damaged from free fall anytime it is dropped into a new storage device. This damage is dependent on many factors such as type of grain, height of <b>travel,</b> <b>contact</b> surfaces, discharge size, and impact angle. As grain drop height increases, so does the amount of mechanical damage incurred due to the impact. For the same distance dropped, the highest percent of breakage will be in maize, followed by soybeans and then wheat. [...] Grain throwers may be used spread grain {{in an attempt to}} reach the full load capacity of a storage space, and can increase damage due to the grain undergoing yet another handling process.|$|R

40|$|The <b>double</b> <b>travelling</b> {{salesman}} problem (TSP) {{with multiple}} stacks (DTSPMS) is a pickup and delivery problem {{in which all}} pickups must be completed before any deliveries can be made. The problem originates from a real-life application where a 40 -foot container (configured as 11 rows of three columns) is used to transport 33 pallets from a set of pickup customers {{to a set of}} delivery customers. The pickups and deliveries are performed in two separate trips, where each trip starts and ends at a depot and visits a number of customers. The aim of the problem is to produce a packing plan for the pallets that minimizes the total transportation cost given that the container cannot be repacked at any stage. In this paper we present an exact solution method based on matching k-best tours to each of the separate pickup and delivery TSPs. The approach is shown to outperform the only known previous exact method for this problem in that solutions can be obtained faster and previously unsolved instances containing as many as 18 customers can now be solved to optimality...|$|R
