500|$|O'Leary {{also worked}} in the early 1970s to exclude trans people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for trans people would be too {{difficult}} to attain. Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [...] upstate New York, but later returned to {{the city in the}} mid-1990s to advocate for homeless members of the gay community. The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: [...] "Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now." [...] "It was horrible. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> work to exclude transvestites {{and at the same time}} criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?" ...|$|E

Fred tells Kenneth that he resembles a man he served with in the service, which Kenneth says [...] "Well, obviously that's a coincidence. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> be in Normandy?". Fred responds by saying that he never told Kenneth where he served.

500|$|In 2006, Ebert noted his own [...] "tendency {{to place}} what I now {{consider}} the year's best film in second place, perhaps because I {{was trying to}} make some kind of point with my top pick," [...] adding, [...] "In 1968, I should have ranked [...] above The Battle of Algiers.

Her father sold his ancestral land to educate her, and worked double shifts to continue to pay for her schooling. In an interview he related that as a youth he had dreamed of becoming a school teacher, but at that time education was not considered important and girls were not even sent to school. [...] "Attitudes are changing back home now, but when I left 30 years ago, I vowed never deny my children so sending them to school was fulfilling my desire for knowledge." [...] He said that he put his daughter's education above that of even his two sons. [...] "It never entered our hearts to ever discriminate. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> be happy if my son is happy and my daughter isn't?

Coyne said, [...] "Stephen [...] {{seems to be}} a fan of the weirder music of the late '80s and early '90s He wanted to evoke the music he got turned onto back then." [...] Coyne suggested a duet with Justin Timberlake, but Hillenburg refused, saying [...] "I don't want any of those sort of commercial weirdos on there. I don't like those commercial people. I like you guys, and Wilco and Ween." [...] American band Wilco wrote and recorded [...] "Just a Kid". One of the film's producers contacted frontman Jeff Tweedy after seeing a SpongeBob air freshener hanging from Tweedy's rearview mirror in [...] Tweedy said, [...] "I fell in love with SpongeBob when I heard him describe the darkness {{at the bottom of the}} sea as 'advanced darkness' <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> not write a song for this film?

500|$|The band {{refused to}} explain their lyrics {{to the press and}} did not print lyric sheets. Curtis told the fanzine Printed Noise, [...] "We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like." [...] The other band members later {{admitted}} they paid little attention to what Curtis was writing. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they [...] "just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion." [...] Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise [...] "is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics". The surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. [...] "This sounds awful but it was only after Ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics", Morris said in 2007. [...] "You'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself. Looking back, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> have been so bleedin' stupid? Of course he was writing about himself. But I didn't go in and grab him and ask, 'What's up?' I have to live with that".|$|E
500|$|Ritvo {{then moved}} Mucho Macho Man to Santa Anita Park {{almost two months}} before the Breeders' Cup races because she felt he [...] "thrived" [...] in California. It was a major {{commitment}} for the horse's team, as Ritvo, Green, Petro, Tapia and Lopez had to leave their home base in Florida, and Reeves had to cover the expenses. Dean Reeves said, [...] "Everybody has basically put their lives and their family second to the benefit and {{the best we can do}} for Macho." [...] The horse's next race was the Awesome Again Stakes at Santa Anita on September 28. [...] Because both Smith and Prado had prior riding commitments, Ritvo and Green decided to contact Gary Stevens. Stevens' contribution to the human interest saga included a comeback in 2013 after having been forced to retire seven years earlier due to debilitating knee pain. He also had his own near-death experience, having survived a major riding accident in 2003. [...] In a twist of serendipity, Stevens' agent, Craig O'Brien, came by the barn to inquire about the horse's availability about the same time Ritvo and Green had decided to see if Stevens was available. Stevens later claimed to be unaware of his agent's machinations. Noting that Stevens had portrayed Seabiscuit's jockey George Woolf in the eponymous film, Ritvo later joked, [...] "I was in Hollywood. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> not use a film star?" [...] In the course of the Awesome Again, Mucho Macho Man settled behind the leaders before making a bid on the final turn. The horse led by three lengths in the homestretch, and accelerated clear of the field to win easily by [...] lengths over Paynter. It was his first win in 2013 and his first Grade I stakes win. [...] The victory was also a [...] "win and you're in" [...] qualifying race for the Breeders' Cup Classic, which included a waiver of the $100,000 entry fee for the Classic.|$|E
