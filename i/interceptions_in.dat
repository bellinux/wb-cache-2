5|$|On September 6, Art Modell died in Baltimore {{at the age}} of 87. Although the Browns {{planned to}} have a moment of silence on their home opener for their former owner, his family asked the team not to, well aware of the less-than-friendly {{reaction}} it was likely to get. Weeden started the Browns' first game of the season. The 28-year-old rookie threw four <b>interceptions</b> <b>in</b> a 17–16 loss to Philadelphia in which the Browns' only touchdown was scored by the defense.|$|E

5|$|The Blitz changed everything. In September 1940 the Luftwaffe flew 6,135 night sorties, {{leading to}} only four combat losses. The Dowding system was {{incapable}} of handling night <b>interceptions</b> <b>in</b> a practical manner, and Dowding continued to state that the only solution was to get AI into operation. Seeking alternatives, the Chief of the Air Staff, Cyril Newall, convened a review committee {{under the direction of}} John Salmond. Salmond built a heavyweight panel including Sholto Douglas, Arthur Tedder, Philip Joubert de la Ferté, and Wilfrid Freeman.|$|E

After his career at Alabama, he joined the Packers in 1935 and played eleven seasons before he retired in 1945. He {{led the league in}} receiving yards in seven separate seasons and in receiving touchdowns in nine. A talented safety on defense, he also led the NFL in <b>interceptions</b> <b>in</b> 1940. Hutson was an eight-time All-Pro selection, a four-time Pro Bowler, and was twice awarded the Joe F. Carr Trophy as the NFL Most Valuable Player.|$|E

5|$|Through 11 {{weeks in}} 2012, the Jets {{struggled}} to a 4–7 record. The presence of quarterback Tim Tebow created a controversy {{as the media}} and fans called for Ryan to bench the inconsistent Mark Sanchez in favor of Tebow. Ryan was criticized for his decision to keep Tebow activated during the Jets' Thanksgiving Day contest against the New England Patriots despite Tebow playing with two broken ribs, leading to questions about his job security. With Tebow inactive for the Jets' following contest against the Arizona Cardinals, Ryan {{made the decision to}} bench Sanchez, who threw three <b>interceptions,</b> <b>in</b> favor of Greg McElroy. McElroy threw a touchdown pass to tight end Jeff Cumberland to score the team's only points in a 7–6 victory over Arizona.|$|E
5|$|After Leaf threw four <b>interceptions</b> <b>in</b> {{the first}} half against the New York Giants in the Week 4 game (September 28), coach Kevin Gilbride benched Leaf in favor of Craig Whelihan. The {{following}} game on October 4 against the Indianapolis Colts matched Leaf against the number one 1998 draft pick Peyton Manning. Indianapolis won 17–12, as both quarterbacks completed 12 of 23 passes with an interception each, but Leaf threw for 160 yards (23 more than Manning), and only Manning threw a touchdown. Manning was never sacked; Leaf was sacked four times. Inside the final two minutes and San Diego down 14–6, Leaf's 56-yard pass to Charlie Jones set up a one-yard Natrone Means touchdown run, but Leaf's potential tying two-point conversion pass to Webster Slaughter was incomplete.|$|E
5|$|After the Falcons traded Favre to the Packers, Miller and Tolliver {{were the}} only quarterbacks on the roster. Before the season started, Wade Wilson signed with the team, and the two shared the role of backup to Miller. Tolliver played two of the first eight games, then was named the {{starting}} quarterback when the Falcons lost Miller for the season {{as a result of}} reconstructive surgery on his left knee. Tolliver's first start of the season came against the 49ers. He completed 16 of 25 passes, but threw three <b>interceptions</b> <b>in</b> a 41–3 loss. The next week against the Cardinals, Tolliver was benched for the final series as Wilson led the team to victory and Tolliver argued with coach Jerry Glanville. Despite the conflict and a shoulder injury, Glanville gave Tolliver the start the following week against the Buffalo Bills. He played a few more games before being replaced by Wilson {{for the rest of the}} season, partially as a result of Wilson throwing five touchdown passes in his first start en route to a 35–7 Falcons victory. Tolliver finished the season with five touchdowns, five interceptions, a 55.7% completion percentage, and a 70.4 QB rating.|$|E
50|$|On November 15, 2009, Woodson {{recorded}} nine tackles (two for loss), a sack, two forced fumbles and an <b>interception</b> <b>in</b> a 17-7 {{victory over}} the Dallas Cowboys.

5|$|After the draft, on May 3, the Bears signed 15 undrafted free agents.

5|$|Before the 1989 season, All-Star safety Bennie Thompson {{left the}} Blue Bombers {{to join the}} New Orleans Saints of the National Football League, leaving an opening on the roster for a new {{starting}} safety. Allen was initially designated to fill this role, but it eventually went to Moustafa Ali. He found early success defensively, making two <b>interceptions</b> <b>in</b> his first five weeks. He also tied the CFL career record for fumbles recovered for touchdowns when he recovered his fourth career blocked punt in an August game against the Toronto Argonauts. In November of that year, Allen again blocked a punt which was recovered by Paul Clatney for a Blue Bombers touchdown. In addition to his large role on special teams, Allen contributed far more defensively in 1989 than he did in his rookie year, recording 27 tackles in 16 regular season games. The Blue Bombers again qualified for the playoffs, but lost to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 10–14 in the East Final.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} regular season {{game at the}} new Lucas Oil Stadium, the Colts lost 29–13 to the Chicago Bears.

Manning passed for 311 yards as the Colts avoided their first 0–2 start since Manning's rookie season. Week 3 matched the Colts with division rival Jacksonville. Manning threw two <b>interceptions</b> <b>in</b> the game, including one that was returned for a touchdown by Rashean Mathis. Jacksonville rushed for 236 yards and held the ball for over 41 minutes.

Jacksonville kicker Josh Scobee made a 51-yard field goal to win the game and drop the Colts to a 1–2 record.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} four seasons, the Colts won 48 of 64 games, but still could not find much success in the postseason. In 2002, they were blown out 41–0 in the wild card round by the New York Jets. In 2003, they won their first two playoff games behind {{impressive}} offensive performances, and reached the AFC title game. There, they lost to the eventual champion New England Patriots 24–14, with Manning throwing four <b>interceptions.</b> <b>In</b> 2004, the Colts {{had one of the}} most spectacular offensive seasons in NFL history, scoring 522 points and gaining 6,582 yards, while Manning set NFL records for most touchdown passes and highest passer rating. But again the Patriots' defense (and snowy conditions) proved too formidable, as they lost 20–3 in the divisional round of the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} the Redskins 24–14 in week 14 {{to move into}} sole possession of {{first place in the}} NFC East. The Redskins held Joe Morris, who had rushed for 181yards in the Giants week eight victory, to 62yards on 22 carries.

5|$|The Trojans next {{traveled}} to face rivals, the California Golden Bears, led by fourth–year head coach Jeff Tedford and quarterback Joe Ayoob. Although the Bears handed the Trojans their last loss in 2003, they were struggling in the season, having lost {{three out of}} the last four games and dropping out of the rankings {{for the first time since}} 2003. The Trojans scored first after Ayoob's first of four <b>interceptions</b> <b>in</b> the game, on a LenDale White rush.
