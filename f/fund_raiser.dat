5|$|A similar {{source of}} funds {{was to be the}} tax on exports of cotton. However, in {{addition}} to the difficulties associated with the blockade, the self-imposed embargo on cotton meant that for all practical purposes the tax was completely ineffective as a <b>fund</b> <b>raiser.</b> Initial optimistic estimates of revenue to be collected through this tax ran as high as 20 million dollars, but in the end only $30 thousand was collected.|$|E
50|$|According to Shaun King, HopeMob {{has been}} criticized by people who raised money but never {{received}} the funds. His answer is that HopeMob has paid out for every story that raised money.

On 6-7 occasions this made <b>fund</b> <b>raisers</b> angry, but nonetheless, King asserts that the goods and services that the funds were raised for were provided to the <b>fund</b> <b>raisers.</b>|$|R

In Smallville: Dragon, Lana visits an antiques dealer, Mrs. Mayfern, looking for a gift for her boyfriend, Whitney. When she leaves she breaks up with Whitney and starts dating Clark.

5|$|Years later, due to Betances' {{experience}} as a logistics facilitator of armed revolts, a <b>fund</b> <b>raiser</b> for the Cuban independence cause, and as a diplomat, José Martí asked Betances to become the leader of Cuban revolutionaries in France. Betances never met Martí personally, but Martí did know Betances' younger sister, Eduviges, who lived in New York City and shared her brother's revolutionary ideals. Martí assisted her financially in her final days, out of admiration for the Betances' family. Betances accepted the assignment out of gratitude towards Martí. Soon after, Martí died in battle in Cuba in 1895, an event that brought Tomás Estrada Palma to {{the leadership of the}} Cuban insurrection movement.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} combines {{systems and}} critical theory {{to analyze the}} relationship of the athletic department and the institutional development office. The {{purpose of the study was}} to propose a model of coordinated athletic fund raising based upon a theoretical framework that explains athletic fund raising as an organizational function within the context of the interdependencies of a system. ^ In the first phase of the research, a theory-based model of coordinated athletic fund raising is set forth. Several key characteristics of a coordinated approach are identified. In the second phase, results of telephone interviews with athletic <b>fund</b> <b>raisers</b> at Division I institutions are reported. Basic descriptive statistics and qualitative data analysis techniques are used to present a full and rich picture of how athletic <b>fund</b> <b>raisers</b> assess the relationship between the two offices. In the third phase of the research, a comparison is made between empirical findings and the model. ^ Relationships between development offices and athletic departments vary greatly in nature and in scope. The majority of athletic <b>fund</b> <b>raisers</b> report that the relationship between the athletic department and development office is strained. Poor relationships may be deleterious to the athletic fund raising effort. A comparison of reported existing relationships to the model suggests that few existing relationships approach the level of coordination presented in the model. The theory-based model is determined to be useful in providing insights into the complex forces that affect athletic fund raising. ^ Recommendations for moving relationships closer to the model focus on strategies that athletic <b>fund</b> <b>raisers</b> can employ to improve the relationship. Recommendations to athletic <b>fund</b> <b>raisers</b> include finding ways to produce and market critical fund raising resources to the development office; emphasizing negotiation as a strategy to improve exchanges; and working to establish better feedback mechanisms and more open lines of communication with the institutional development office. ...|$|R
