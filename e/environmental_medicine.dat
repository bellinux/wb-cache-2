This differs from Haldanian models which are parallel models {{and assume that}} all compartments are exposed to ambient partial pressures and no gas interchange occurs between compartments. A serial model assumes that the diffusion takes place {{through a series of}} compartments, and only one is exposed to the ambient partial pressures and is in effect a compartmentalised version of the Hempelman bulk diffusion slab model.|$|E

5|$|Since lead {{has been}} used widely for centuries, the effects of {{exposure}} are worldwide. Environmental lead is ubiquitous, and everyone has some measurable blood lead level. Atmospheric lead pollution increased dramatically beginning in the 1950s {{as a result of}} the widespread use of leaded gasoline. Lead is one of the largest <b>environmental</b> <b>medicine</b> problems in terms of numbers of people exposed and the public health toll it takes. Lead exposure accounts for about 0.2% of all deaths and 0.6% of disability adjusted life years globally.|$|E

[...] She continued the research on air pollution, which she began under Drinker, until she left the school in 1977. Partly {{because of the difficulty}} in obtaining tenure at Harvard, both for herself and for her colleague Sheldon Murphy, and partly because she needed to work with engineers to produce suitable combustion products, she moved her research to the nearby Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and accepted a promotion to lecturer, securing funding for 12 years. When she moved, her new focus was the role of metals in the inhalation of sulfuric acid. [...] Dissatisfied with the attention the research received at MIT, she moved to the Institute of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Medicine</b> [...] at [...] New York University in 1989 as a senior research scientist, where she remained until her retirement in 1996.|$|E

2500|$|The {{possibility}} of an alternate site located in Saudi Arabia has also drawn attention due to the Apostle Paul's assertion {{in the first century}} that Mount Sinai was located in Arabia, although in Paul's time, the region of Arabia Petraea would have included both the modern Sinai peninsula and northwestern Saudi Arabia. A possible candidate within the Arabia theory has been that of Jabal al-Lawz (meaning 'mountain of almonds'). Advocates for Jabal al-Lawz include Lennart Moller (a Swedish professor in <b>environmental</b> <b>medicine)</b> and also Ron Wyatt and Bob Cornuke. Allen Kerkeslager, associate professor of Theology at St. Joseph's University believes that the archaeological evidence is too tenuous to draw conclusions but has stated that [...] "Jabal al Lawz may also be the most convincing option for identifying the Mt. Sinai of biblical tradition" [...] and should be researched. A number of researchers support this hypothesis while others dispute it.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, the Marine Corps {{created a}} battery of six combat proxy tests {{in an attempt to}} answer the {{question}} [...] "Are Females Ready for the Fight?" [...] according to results presented at the 3rd International Congress on Soldiers’ Physical Performance, which was hosted in Boston in August 2014 by the United States Army Research Institute of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Medicine.</b> For these tests, about 400 male Marines and almost the same number of female Marines were tested on pull-ups, two weight-lifting exercises, a 120-mm tank loading drill, a 155-mm artillery round carry and a 7-foot wall-climb while wearing a fighting load of about 30 pounds. Of the 35 Marines deemed best performers, 92 percent were males and 8 percent were females, proving that some women [...] "are physically capable of meeting the demands of closed combat occupations," [...] according to results of the study presented by Karen Kelly, a San Diego-based research physiologist. However, the Marine Corps decided the proxy tests were not an adequate predictor of success in ground combat jobs.|$|E
50|$|According {{with some}} {{opinions}} {{the fields of}} microbiology, which studies viruses, bacteria and fungi are not {{within the scope of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>medicine,</b> if the spread of infection is directly from human to human. However, infections that are water-borne (e.g. cholera and gastroenteritis caused by norovirus or campylobacteria), or food-borne, are typical concerns of <b>environmental</b> <b>medicine.</b> Its role is preventive as far as possible. Much of epidemiology, which studies patterns of disease and injury, is not within the scope of <b>environmental</b> <b>medicine,</b> but e.g. air pollution epidemiology is a highly active branch of environmental health and <b>environmental</b> <b>medicine.</b> In addition, any disease with a large genetic component usually falls outside the scope of <b>environmental</b> <b>medicine,</b> although in diseases like asthma or allergies both environmental and genetic approaches are needed.|$|E
