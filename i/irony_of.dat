5|$|Music {{journalist}} Peter Doggett {{notes the}} <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> the surf music reference. In 1970, business manager Michael Jeffery committed Hendrix to {{contributing to the}} soundtrack for Rainbow Bridge; his music is heard during surfing scenes with David Nuuhiwa and others. Pioneer surf guitarist Dick Dale, {{who claimed to have}} met Hendrix in Los Angeles in 1964, believed the mention was Hendrix's way of encouraging his recuperation when Dale was seriously ill.|$|E
5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never giving in to her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores the <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E
5|$|Ten Nights in a Bar Room is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Adapted from the novel Ten Nights in a Bar-Room and What I Saw There by Timothy Shay Arthur, the production focuses on Joe Morgan after {{he has become a}} hopeless drunkard. Often Morgan's young daughter, Mary, comes to beg her father to return home. One day, she appears during a fight between the two men and is fatally struck by a bottle thrown by the saloon-keeper. Before Mary dies she asks her father to promise to swear off alcohol and he accepts. He is reformed and becomes successful, while the saloon-keeper is killed in a fight in an <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> fate. The film was released on November 4, 1910 and met with mixed reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|Burne-Jones {{was elected}} an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1885, and the {{following}} year he exhibited (for the only time) at the Academy, showing The Depths of the Sea, {{a painting of a}} mermaid carrying down with her a youth whom she has unconsciously drowned in the impetuosity of her love. This picture adds to the habitual haunting charm a tragic <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> conception and a felicity of execution which give it a place apart among Burne-Jones's works. He formally resigned his Associateship in 1893. One of the Perseus series was exhibited in 1887, two more in 1888, with The Brazen Tower, inspired by the same legend. In 1890 the second series of The Legend of Briar Rose were exhibited by themselves, and won the widest admiration. The huge watercolor, The Star of Bethlehem, painted for the corporation of Birmingham, was exhibited in 1891. A long illness for some time checked the painter's activity, which, when resumed, was much occupied with decorative schemes. An exhibition of his work was held at the New Gallery in the winter of 1892-1893. To this period belong several of his comparatively few portraits. In 1894 Burne-Jones was made a baronet. Ill-health again interrupted the progress of his works, chief among which was the vast Arthur in Avalon. In the winter following his death a second exhibition of his works was held at the New Gallery, and an exhibition of his drawings (including some of the charmingly humorous sketches made for children) at the Burlington Fine Arts Club.|$|E

25|$|The <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> the {{situation}} was that the primary reason {{this section of the}} creek was in so natural a state was that it had been protected from other development through the land having been reserved for the section of the proposed F35 Scoresby Freeway (Renamed Eastlink) to join the end of the Eastern Freeway under the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan.|$|E
25|$|As {{time went}} on, Franklin {{depended}} less on his literary conventions, {{and more on}} his own native humor.

25|$|Transformative {{products}} are exciting, but robo-pets {{are even more}} exciting.

25|$|Tacitus's {{political}} career was largely lived {{out under the}} emperor Domitian. His experience of the tyranny, corruption, and decadence of that era (8196) may explain the bitterness and <b>irony</b> <b>of</b> his political analysis.
