BACKGROUND OF SF 6 GAS USAGE IN JAPAN In recent years, since there has been a significant increase in electricity demand, substation equipment has had to be more reliable and compact, coping with higher voltage and larger capacity ratings. By applying sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) gas to substation equipment like circuit breakers and switchgear, downsizing and lower maintenance costs can be achieved to greater degrees than in a conventional air-insulated substation because of the excellent performance of SF 6 gas. Therefore, gas-insulated equipment like gas circuit breakers (GCB), <b>gas-insulated</b> <b>switchgears</b> (GIS) and <b>gas-insulated</b> transformers (GIT) are being widely and commonly used. Particularly in Japan, where land acquisition is extremely difficult, there is a large demand for GIS. On the other hand, because SF 6 gas was identified as a greenhouse gas in recent years, electri...|$|R
50|$|A {{switchgear}} may be {{a simple}} open-air isolator switch {{or it may be}} insulated by some other substance. An effective although more costly form of switchgear is the <b>gas-insulated</b> <b>switchgear</b> (GIS), where the conductors and contacts are insulated by pressurized sulfur hexafluoride gas (SF6). Other common types are oil or vacuum insulated switchgear.|$|E
50|$|Switchgear {{for lower}} {{voltages}} may be entirely enclosed within a building. For higher voltages (over about 66 kV), switchgear is typically mounted outdoors and insulated by air, although this requires {{a large amount}} of space. <b>Gas-insulated</b> <b>switchgear</b> saves space compared with air-insulated equipment, although the equipment cost is higher. Oil insulated switchgear presents an oil spill hazard.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{demands in}} {{electric}} energy stimulates {{a shift in}} functional requirements to power distribution networks and pushes equipment manufacturers to develop highly optimized products where high rated parameters (e. g., energy, voltages) are combined with reduced geometrical dimensions of components. Thus, newly developed <b>gas-insulated</b> <b>switchgears</b> (GIS) for distribution networks operate at enhanced electric fields, which should be withstood by the insulation. In this case, new additional challenges are imposed due to strong requirements concerning environmental safety that call for replacement of SF 6 -gas used as insulating medium in GIS by more environmentally friendly substitutes. Ideally, future “green” insulation is {{to be based on}} natural gases (e. g. synthetic air), which, however, are characterized by much lower electrical performance and thus need to be strengthened, e. g., by using solid insulating elements. To provide reliable design criteria for hybrid gas-solid insulation, there is a need in detailed understanding of basic physical phenomena taking place due to its exposure to strong electric fields. These include initiation and propagation of electrical discharges in gas phase, interactions of produced gas discharge plasma with solid dielectric surfaces, charge transport though solid material, etc. The research presented in the thesis focuses on analyzing field induced phenomena in gas and aims at developing computer simulation framework incorporating physical processes associated with the motion of charged species in gas medium under electric fields. The model of electrical discharges in air developed in the present study comprises a set of coupled non-linear partial differential equations (PDE) describing time dependent drift and diffusion of charge carriers associated with reactions between them (ionization, recombination, etc.); dynamics of electric fields in discharge volume affected by accumulated space charges; and intensity of photo-ionization in gas. The reactions rate coefficients for the charge transport equations are derived from numerical solution of Boltzmann’s equation for electrons energy distribution function in N 2 :O 2 (80 : 20) mixture. The set of PDEs is solved numerically utilizing commercial software based on finite element method. Numerical challenges and details of the implementation are discussed in the thesis; in particular, logarithmic formulation of transport equations, approaches for numerical stabilization of the solution, adaptive mesh refinement, etc. The developed computational framework is utilized for analyzing several study cases including propagation of streamer discharges in air in different 2 d geometrical arrangements and streamer branching in fully 3 d representation.
