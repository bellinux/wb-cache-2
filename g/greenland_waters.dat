50|$|Convection in the Labrador Sea is {{the result}} of a {{combination}} of cyclonic oceanographic circulation of the sea currents and cyclonic atmospheric forcing.

During winter months low pressure dominates in this region, and in years with a positive North Atlantic Oscillation deeper convection is observed.|$|R

50|$|Up to 2006, all EU {{funds to}} Greenland (then €42.8 {{million per year}}) went via the EU-Greenland fishing agreement.

It has been given aid since it {{pulled out of the}} EU (see below) in 1985 to roughly the same amount it was previously receiving in EU structural funds (which it lost the right to receive due to its secession). This amounted to about 7% of Greenland's budget. The amount paid via the fishing agreement was in return for EU vessels fishing in <b>Greenland's</b> <b>waters</b> and to help restructure Greenland's fishing fleet. However, this deal was struck down by the European Court of Auditors, who felt the amount the EU was paying was too high for the quantity of fish caught.|$|R
5000|$|The three deep waters {{consist of}} the <b>Greenland</b> Sea Deep <b>Water,</b> Norwegian Sea Deep Water, and the Arctic Ocean Deep <b>Water.</b> The <b>Greenland</b> Sea Deep <b>Water</b> has a {{temperature}} of approximately -1.8 °C and a salinity of 34.895 psu. This water mass is formed by deep convection that occurs intermittently in the Greenland gyre. The Arctic Ocean Deep Water is approximately 34.92 psu. This water mass has a higher salinity due to brine rejection in the Arctic Seas. The depth is around 1500 and 2000 meters. The Norwegian Sea Deep Water {{is a combination of}} the Arctic Ocean Deep <b>Water</b> and the <b>Greenland</b> Sea Deep <b>Water.</b> This water mass is found below 2000 meters.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} {{area classification}} for Landsat 7 satellite image. The {{main purpose of}} this system is to classify the area of each cluster contained in a satellite image.

Clustering is an unsupervised learning method that aimsto classify an image into homogeneous regions. This system is implemented based on color features with K-means clustering unsupervised algorithm. This method {{does not need to}} train image before clustering. The clusters of satellite image are grouped into a set of three clusters for Landsat 7 satellite image. For this work the combined band 432 from Landsat 7 satellite is used as an input.

50|$|In the 1990s, Hudson {{performed}} {{surveys in}} <b>Greenland</b> <b>waters,</b> Rankin Inlet and Chesterfield Inlet. During operations in <b>Greenland</b> <b>waters,</b> ice tore a 15 ft gash in {{the hull of}} the ship. Hudson was forced to return to Canada for repairs.

Hudson contributed to the recovery operations during the recovery operations of Swissair Flight 111 in the waters off of Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, Canada during the autumn months of 1998. From 1999 to 2001, Hudson performed surveys in the Sable Island region. In 2007 the Government of Canada announced several new shipbuilding projects for the Canadian Coast Guard, including a replacement for Hudson, {{expected to be in}} service by 2012. The ship rescued the seven-man crew of the fishing vessel Ocean Commander which burned and sank on 6 July 2009. The construction of the replacement for Hudson was delayed, forcing the Canadian Coast Guard to replace rusting plates aboard Hudson in 2012. The repairs were completed in September 2015.|$|E

40|$|Neighboring tidewater glaciers often exhibit {{asynchronous}} dynamic behavior, despite relatively uniform regional atmospheric and oceanic forcings. This variability may {{be controlled}} {{by a combination of}} local factors, including glacier and fjord geometry, fjord heat content and circulation, and glacier surface melt. In order to characterize and understand contrasts in adjacent tidewater glacier and fjord dynamics, we made coincident ice-ocean-atmosphere observations at high temporal resolution (minutes to weeks) within a 10 000 km 2 area near Uummannaq, <b>Greenland.</b> <b>Water</b> column velocity, temperature and salinity measurements reveal systematic differences in neighboring fjords that imply contrasting circulation patterns. The observed ocean velocity and hydrography, combined with numerical modeling, suggest that subglacial discharge {{plays a major role in}} setting fjord conditions. In addition, satellite remote sensing of seasonal ice flow speed and terminus position reveal both speedup and slow-down in response to melt, as well as differences in calving style among the neighboring glaciers. Glacier force budgets and modeling also point toward subglacial discharge as a key factor in glacier behavior. For the studied region, individual glacier and fjord geometry modulate subglacial discharge, which leads to contrasts in both fjord and glacier dynamics...|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} 30 years, {{it has been}} known that dense waters are created in the Arctic Ocean. However, before the late 1980 s, {{observations}} indicated that Arctic Ocean deep waters only modified the deep <b>water</b> in the <b>Greenland</b> Sea, which was still {{thought of as the}} major source of dense water. In the mid- 1990 s, this picture began to fade. The deep convection in the Greenland Sea weakened and only Arctic Intermediate Water was formed. A deep salinity maximum was reinforced and a temperature maximum emerged at middepth. The densities of the salinity and temperature maxima were those of the deep waters in the Arctic Ocean, and one possibility was that waters below the convection were ventilated by Arctic Ocean deep waters from the East Greenland Current. Between 1998 and 2010, the salinity and temperature of the deep <b>water</b> in the <b>Greenland</b> Sea increased, implying continuous input from the East <b>Greenland</b> Current. <b>Water</b> from the <b>Greenland</b> Sea advected to Fram Strait now has almost Arctic Ocean characteristics and cannot significantly change the outflowing Arctic Ocean waters by mixing in the East Greenland Current, leading to a more-rapid transformation of the deep <b>Greenland</b> Sea <b>water</b> column...|$|R

[...] The captain believed that such an explosion would damage a nearby NATO base and could cause a nuclear war between the Soviet Union and the United States. Mikhail Gorbachev later wrote that [...] "An explosion on board the K-19 could have been taken for a military provocation or even an attempt to launch a nuclear strike on the North American coast.
