5|$|Tilda Swinton reprises {{her role}} as <b>Jadis,</b> the White Witch. Her ghost appears as the hag and {{werewolf}} attempt to resurrect her. Swinton and her two children also cameoed towards the film's end as centaurs.|$|E
5|$|Nikabrik, {{with the}} aid of a hag and a werewolf, offers Caspian his help to {{guarantee}} victory. The hag uses black sorcery to summon <b>Jadis,</b> the White Witch. From inside a wall of ice, the White Witch tries convincing Caspian to free her, when Peter, Edmund, Lucy and Trumpkin arrive. The hag, werewolf, and Nikabrik are all killed. Edmund shatters the ice, destroying the Witch's apparition.|$|E
25|$|In The Magician's Nephew, <b>Jadis</b> is {{introduced}} as the Queen of Charn, {{a city in}} an entirely different world from Narnia. She was the last of a long line of kings and queens, who began well but grew evil over many generations and conquered the entire world of Charn. <b>Jadis,</b> a powerful sorceress, fought a bloody war of rebellion against her sister. On the point of defeat, <b>Jadis</b> chose not to submit, but spoke instead the Deplorable Word that destroyed all life on Charn except her own. She then cast a spell of enchanted sleep upon herself to await someone who could rescue her from Charn.|$|E
25|$|Aslan carries Lucy and Susan on {{his back}} as he hurries to <b>Jadis's</b> castle. He {{breathes}} upon the stone statues in the courtyard, restoring them to life.|$|R
2500|$|Parallels {{may also}} be found in Lewis's other writings. <b>Jadis's</b> {{references}} to [...] "reasons of State", and her claim to own the people of Charn and to be beyond morality, represent the eclipse of the medieval Christian belief in natural law by the political concept of sovereignty, as embodied first in royal absolutism and then in modern dictatorships. Uncle Andrew represents the Faustian element in the origins of modern science.|$|R
2500|$|A talking beaver {{intercepts}} them, proves {{himself a}} friend, and hides {{the children in}} his den. There, he and Mrs. Beaver tell them of a prophecy that <b>Jadis's</b> power will fail when two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve fill the four thrones at Cair Paravel. Aslan, the great lion and the rightful King, has been absent for many years but is now [...] "on the move again" [...] in Narnia.|$|R
25|$|<b>Jadis,</b> {{the white}} witch, {{is said to}} be descended from Adam's first wife Lilith (see below).|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} year of Narnia, the Creation of Narnia was {{witnessed}} by six creatures: <b>Jadis,</b> Empress of Charn, Digory Kirke, Polly Plummer, Andrew Ketterley, Frank the cabman, and his cab horse Strawberry. During a failed attempt by Digory to transfer <b>Jadis</b> from London in our world back to her own world of Charn, the group arrived in the unmade darkness of Narnia just prior to Aslan calling it into being.|$|E
25|$|During their visit, Digory accidentally wakes <b>Jadis</b> from {{suspended}} animation, {{and she is}} able {{to leave}} the world with them.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{believe that}} Charn {{stands for the}} natural {{progression}} of human depravity. [...] There is a striking similarity between <b>Jadis's</b> description of {{the life and death}} of her city and the text of the prophetic book of Nahum concerning the Biblical city of Nineveh. There are also similarities between the world of Charn, and the Biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, two cities whose depravity and wickedness resulted in their own devastation. Judging from the expressions of the waxwork images of Jadis' ancestors, it is apparent that while her race started out being gentle and wise, they later became corrupt. This has a parallel in J. R. R. Tolkien's depictions of the Kings of NÃºmenor (Lewis and Tolkien were friends). [...] The hall of waxworks may also be inspired by the underground grotto of mummies in King Solomon's Mines, an image which Lewis found very powerful. [...] The name [...] "Charn" [...] suggests [...] "charnel house," [...] a repository for human skeletal remains.|$|R
25|$|Tilda Swinton as <b>Jadis,</b> the White Witch, {{who holds}} Narnia under an eternal winter without Christmas or Spring or Summer.|$|E
25|$|Aslan: The Lion who was {{the king}} of Narnia, who kills <b>Jadis</b> in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.|$|E
25|$|In the BBC Radio {{productions}} of The Magician's Nephew and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe <b>Jadis</b> was played by Rosemary Martin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Jadis</b> has the {{appearance}} of a very tall human woman but is actually the last scion of the royal house of Charn as shown in The Magician's Nephew. In later Narnian times her origin on Charn is not known to her subjects. <b>Jadis</b> claims human descent to legitimize her rule, but in Chapter 8 of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe Mr. Beaver describes her as descended from a Jinn and Adam's first wife, Lilith, thus having no human blood at all.|$|E
25|$|Polly and Digory {{grab her}} and put on their rings to take her out of their world, {{dragging}} with them Uncle Andrew, Frank the cab-driver, and Frank's horse, since all were touching one another when the children grabbed their rings. In the Wood between the Worlds they jump into a pool, hoping it leads back to Charn. Instead they stumble into a dark void that <b>Jadis</b> recognises as a world not yet created. They then all witness {{the creation of a}} new world by the lion Aslan, who brings stars, plants, and animals into existence as he sings. <b>Jadis,</b> as terrified by his singing as the others are attracted to it, tries to kill Aslan with the iron rod; but it rebounds harmlessly off him, and in the creative soil of the new world it sprouts into a growing lamp-post. <b>Jadis</b> flees.|$|E
25|$|Lilith is also {{mentioned}} in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, by C.S.Lewis. The character Mr. Beaver ascribes the ancestry {{of the main}} antagonist, <b>Jadis</b> the White Witch, to Lilith.|$|E
25|$|Aslan next {{appointed}} {{its first}} rulers, the cabby and his wife, as King Frank I and Queen Helen (the cabby's wife Nellie was called into Narnia by Aslan soon afterwards), and commanded them to rule peacefully over the talking beasts. Aware that the evil Witch-Queen <b>Jadis</b> had entered his new land, Aslan sent Digory {{to retrieve a}} magic apple from a garden in the Western Wild beyond Narnia. When Digory returned, the apple was planted by the river, where it immediately grew into a tree which as Aslan explained would protect Narnia from <b>Jadis</b> for many years.|$|E
25|$|Sorlois: A city {{or similar}} {{location}} {{in the world of}} Charn; named by <b>Jadis</b> as a place that had been destroyed or devastated (presumably by her). The name is probably taken from the Arthurian legends.|$|E
25|$|When Digory, Polly, <b>Jadis</b> of Charn, Uncle Andrew, the Cabby and Strawberry {{inadvertently}} enter a {{new world}} using magic rings, they find it an empty void. Aslan appears, and {{through the power of}} his singing, calls the world of Narnia into existence.|$|E
25|$|The {{voice of}} <b>Jadis</b> was {{provided}} by Elizabeth Counsell in Focus on the Family's radio drama versions of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and The Magician's Nephew. Counsell also made a cameo appearance as a lamb in The Last Battle.|$|E
25|$|The Story of the Amulet {{written by}} Edith Nesbit also {{contains}} scenes {{that can be}} considered precursors to sequences presenting <b>Jadis,</b> particularly in The Magician's Nephew. Nesbit's short story The Aunt and Amabel includes the motif of a girl entering a wardrobe {{to gain access to}} a magical place.|$|E
25|$|<b>Jadis</b> is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of The Magician's Nephew and of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in C. S. Lewis's series, The Chronicles of Narnia. She is {{commonly referred to as}} the White Witch in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, as she is the Witch who froze Narnia in the Hundred Years Winter.|$|E
25|$|<b>Jadis</b> {{is viewed}} as {{significantly}} more psychopathic and malevolent, possessing an instinctively violent streak and the expressed disregard for {{the lives of others}} - during the Battle of Beruna, she declares that no prisoners are to be taken simply since she has no interest in taking any. She is also hinted to have a cynical, dry sense of humour.|$|E
25|$|Many years later, a 12-year-old Digory Kirke and {{his friend}} Polly Plummer arrive {{in the ruins of}} Charn through Digory's uncle's magic. The {{children}} find the bell that <b>Jadis</b> left to break the spell. Despite Polly's warning not to ring the bell, Digory does so. <b>Jadis</b> is awakened and by holding on to them is transported with them back to London in the year 1900. She initially aims to conquer the world to which she is transported, but finds that her magic does not work there. Digory, seeking to correct his mistake, attempts to transport her back to Charn, but they end up instead in the world of Narnia at the moment of its creation by the lion Aslan. As Aslan approaches, she attacks him with the rod of iron she has torn by main strength from a London lamp post; but when this has no effect, she flees.|$|E
25|$|Western Wild : A {{location}} in Narnia. A great western land of mountains and pine forests, {{it is here}} that Diggory and Polly find the silver apple the Great Tree grows from at a garden at the Great River's source. It is also here that Queen <b>Jadis</b> ate one of the magic apples in vain and became the White Witch.|$|E
25|$|<b>Jadis,</b> {{commonly}} known during her rule of Narnia as the White Witch, {{is the main}} antagonist of The Magician's Nephew and The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. She is the witch responsible for the freezing of Narnia resulting in the Hundred Year Winter. The White Witch {{was born in the}} world of Charn, before the creation of Narnia, and died in battle in Narnian year 1000.|$|E
25|$|Aslan {{explains}} that <b>Jadis</b> will pose a great {{threat to the}} Narnians, and charges Digory and Polly with a quest to acquire a magic apple so they may plant it to protect the land. To aid them, he turns Strawberry into a winged horse named Fledge. When the quest is complete, he crowns Frank and Helen, and advises Digory to take an apple from the tree to revive his sick mother.|$|E
25|$|For {{the brief}} {{period of time that}} <b>Jadis</b> is on Earth, she is shown to have no magical power, but to retain her phenomenal strength. This is {{demonstrated}} when she battles with Metropolitan Police in London, wielding the cross-bar she wrenched from a lamp post. The same cross-bar was taken into the new world that would become Narnia, and grew into the full lamp post encountered by Lucy Pevensie many years later.|$|E
25|$|Calormene {{social and}} {{political}} institutions are depicted as essentially unchanged between the time of The Horse and His Boy and The Last Battle - {{more than a thousand}} years, in which Narnia has profoundly changed several times. This is clearly an artifact of the order in which C. S. Lewis wrote and published the stories, with the two stories above and The Magician's Nephew which also references ancient Mesopotamian civilisation in its depiction of Queen <b>Jadis</b> and Charn, appearing last three of the seven.|$|E
25|$|All the {{characters}} immediately feel awe for Aslan. <b>Jadis</b> expresses this as fear and hatred, and before fleeing she assaults Aslan {{with an iron}} bar that she tore from a lamp-post in London. Aslan is unperturbed and continues calling plants and animals into existence. The power of his song {{is so great that}} even the iron bar, dropped on fertile earth, grows into a functioning lamp post, and toffees sprout into fruit trees. Aslan claims the power of his song will last for a few days.|$|E
25|$|In The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, in Narnian year 1000, four siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie, entered Narnia {{through a}} {{wardrobe}} Digory had built from {{the wood of}} a magical Narnian tree. Aslan returned to Narnia at the same time, defeated the foreign ruler <b>Jadis,</b> {{now known as the}} White Witch, and set up the four children as kings and queens. They ruled for fifteen years before returning to England as if no time had passed at all, back in the state of childhood.|$|E
25|$|The {{timeline}} also lists Narnia {{dates for}} {{events that are}} mentioned in passing, or only implied, in the books. For example, the timeline indicates that Moonwood the Hare lived around the Narnian year 570 (mentioned in the Last Battle), that the White Witch <b>Jadis</b> returns to Narnia around year 898 (corresponding roughly with her hundred-year reign), that King Ram of Archenland succeeds Cor in 1050 (as stated, without the year in The Horse and His Boy), and that Queen Swanwhite lived around the year 1502 (also mentioned in The Last Battle).|$|E
25|$|<b>Jadis</b> {{does not}} appear in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, though the stone knife she used to kill Aslan at the Stone Table is found on Ramandu's island by three of the Seven Great Lords of Narnia. Disagreeing on what course to take, one of them takes up the knife to use against the other two, whereupon all three fall into an enchanted sleep. The knife may be {{intended}} as an analogy to the Holy Lance, the spear used to pierce Jesus Christ, according to the Gospel of John.|$|E
25|$|<b>Jadis</b> {{makes her}} way to the garden on a {{mountain}} west of Narnia, where she eats an apple that she believes will make her immortal and give her eternal life. However, this supposed immortality comes at a cost: her skin is bleached white, and the evil in her heart causes her eternal misery. She cannot stand the sight of the tree that Aslan has Digory plant in Narnia from the fruit of the garden, and she thus stays to the north of Narnia, working to develop her magic.|$|E
25|$|Echoing the Christian {{theme of}} betrayal, repentance, and {{subsequent}} redemption via blood sacrifice, Edmund betrays his siblings to <b>Jadis,</b> the White Witch, but quickly realises {{the true nature}} of the witch and her evil intentions towards his siblings, and joins Aslan's side. At that point he is redeemed by the sacrifice of Aslan's life and he joins the fight against the White Witch. Lucy is the youngest of the four Pevensie siblings. Of all the Pevensie children, Lucy is the closest to Aslan, and of all the human characters who visit Narnia, Lucy is perhaps the one who believes in Narnia the most.|$|E
25|$|She is unaware, however, {{that due}} to a deeper magic from before Narnia's founding, that Aslan's life will be {{restored}} as he was an innocent, willing victim who had offered {{his life in a}} traitor's stead. Aslan then reaches her castle and restores all her statues to life, and brings them as reinforcements to the battle at Beruna against the witch's army. Her army is defeated, and Aslan himself kills <b>Jadis,</b> while most of her followers are killed and the remnants of her army flee and are eventually killed by Aslan's followers, who now serve Narnia under their new rulers.|$|E
