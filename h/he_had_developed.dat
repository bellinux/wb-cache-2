5|$|One {{of those}} {{attending}} the 1906 ceremonies at the Kansas monument was A. T. Hill, {{a resident of}} Logan, Kansas. Hill had no formal training as an archaeologist—indeed, his formal education had ended in the fourth grade. However, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> {{a strong interest in}} the history and archaeology of the Great Plains.|$|E
5|$|When Bruce Lee died in 1973, he left an {{unreleased}} movie {{script that}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> with James Coburn and Stirling Silliphant called The Silent Flute. The script became Circle of Iron (1978), {{and in the}} film, Carradine played the four roles that were originally intended for Lee. Carradine considered this to be among his best work.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his success}} as a producer, West's true {{aspiration}} {{was to be a}} rapper. Though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> his rapping long before he began producing, it was often a challenge for West to be accepted as a rapper, and he struggled to attain a record deal. Multiple record companies ignored him because he did not portray the 'gangsta image' prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time. After a series of meetings with Capitol Records, West was ultimately denied an artist deal.|$|E
5|$|His {{role with}} the team diminished over the {{following}} two seasons, as McGrattan appeared in only 45 games in 2006–07 and 38 in 2007–08. He had only five points and 146 PIM combined between the two seasons. McGrattan made headlines midway through the 2007–08 campaign when he fought teammate and goaltender Ray Emery – himself a noted fighter – in practice. McGrattan's on-ice performance had suffered over time in Ottawa {{as a result of}} a worsening drinking problem <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> beginning early in his career with Binghamton.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, Reubens {{performed}} at local comedy clubs and made four guest appearances on The Gong Show {{as part of}} a boy–girl act <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> with Charlotte McGinnis, called The Hilarious Betty and Eddie. He soon joined the Los Angeles–based improvisational comedy team The Groundlings and remained a member for six years, working with Bob McClurg, John Paragon, Susan Barnes, and Phil Hartman. Hartman and Reubens became friends, often writing and working on material together. In 1980, he had a small part as a waiter in The Blues Brothers.|$|E

5|$|On March 30, 1981, Ronald Reagan, 40th President of the United States, {{and three}} others were shot and wounded by John Hinckley Jr. in Washington, D.C., as they were leaving a {{speaking}} engagement at the Washington Hilton Hotel. Hinckley's motivation for the attack was to impress actress Jodie Foster, over whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> an obsession after seeing her in the 1976 film Taxi Driver.|$|E
5|$|Professorship brought Rimsky-Korsakov {{financial}} security, which {{encouraged him}} {{to settle down and}} to start a family. In December 1871 he proposed to Nadezhda Purgold, with whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> a close relationship over weekly gatherings of The Five at the Purgold household. They married in July 1872, with Mussorgsky serving as best man. The Rimsky-Korsakovs had seven children. One of their sons, Andrei, became a musicologist, married the composer Yuliya Veysberg and wrote a multi-volume study of his father's life and work.|$|E
5|$|Rewrites of {{the script}} {{gradually}} {{moved away from the}} ensemble of comedians and began to focus on two central characters, at which point Murphy left the project. For Ratner however, the modified script reminded him of the Ocean's Eleven remake, a project <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> but for which he was unavailable due to his commitment to directing Rush Hour 2.|$|E

50|$|His primary area of {{research}} involves the development of numerical schemes for hyperbolic partial differential equations using finite difference method. Together with Peter Lax, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>developed</b> the now classical Lax-Wendroff method. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>developed</b> two-dimensional HLLE Riemann solver and associated Godunov-type difference scheme for gas dynamics problems.

5|$|Saint-Amant {{wanted a}} third match, but Staunton was {{initially}} unwilling as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> heart palpitations {{during the second}} match. Von der Lasa later suggested this was why Staunton faded in the second match. However, after a long, difficult negotiation, which he reported in the Chess Player's Chronicle, Staunton went to Paris intending to start their third match in October 1844, but he caught pneumonia while travelling and almost died; the match was postponed and never took place.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{licensed}} to practise {{medicine in the}} United States, he began testing the boxes on human beings diagnosed with cancer and schizophrenia. In one case the test had to be stopped prematurely because the subject heard a rumour that Reich was insane; there were stories, which were false, {{that he had been}} hospitalized in the Utica State Mental Hospital. In another case the father of an eight-year-old girl with cancer approached him for help, then complained to the American Medical Association that he was practising without a licence. He asked his supporters to stick with him through the criticism, believing that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> a grand unified theory of physical and mental health.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} the plot {{concerned}} {{the crew of the}} Enterprise coming across God in space, something which Roddenberry had previously wanted to include in The Original Series but it had been turned down by NBC Primetime's executives. He thought that such an idea might be palatable to the Daytime executives instead. Roddenberry felt that such an episode would work better in animated form and asked Brody to work up a full script. Brody returned home and started work on the script immediately, wanting to improve it far beyond the point that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> when he pitched it for The Original Series.|$|E

5|$|At this point, Rejewski {{ran into}} {{difficulties}} {{due to the}} large number of unknowns in the set of equations that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed.</b> He would later comment in 1980 that it was still not known whether such a set of six equations was soluble without further data. But he was assisted by cryptographic documents that Section D of French military intelligence (the Deuxième Bureau), under future General Gustave Bertrand, had obtained and passed on to the Polish Cipher Bureau. The documents, procured from a spy in the German Cryptographic Service, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, included the Enigma settings for the months of September and October 1932. About 9 or 10 December 1932, the documents were given to Rejewski. They enabled him {{to reduce the number of}} unknowns and solve the wirings of the rotors and reflector.|$|E
5|$|Born in New York City, Franken {{moved to}} Minnesota {{when he was}} four. With his writing partner Tom Davis, with whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> an {{interest}} in improvisational theater at the prestigious college preparatory school The Blake School, he {{was hired as a}} writer for SNL at its inception in 1975. He worked on the show as a writer and performer until 1980, and returned from 1985 to 1995. After leaving SNL, he wrote and acted in movies and television shows. He also hosted a nationally syndicated political radio talk show, The Al Franken Show, and wrote seven books, four of which are political satires critical of conservative politics. His latest book, Al Franken, Giant of the Senate, about his time in the Senate, was a New York Times Non-Fiction Best Seller.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Sanchez entered the eighth grade, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> an {{interest}} in football but was unsure of what position to play. His father consulted coaches Bill Cunerty, who formerly coached at Saddleback College, and Bob Johnson, the head coach at Mission Viejo High School. Both coaches stated Mark could be a quarterback if he applied himself and was open to learning {{the intricacies of the}} position. Nick Sr. trained Mark during sessions in their backyard or at the park. Mark, who was attending Santa Margarita High School, joined the football team. During his first pass attempt as a sophomore, Mark threw a 55-yard touchdown.|$|E

5|$|For Thanksgiving 1988, {{his family}} spent the holiday with him, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> neuropathy and was increasingly bed-ridden and reliant on morphine; {{he died in}} his bed on December 16, 1988 {{at the age of}} 41. Sylvester had planned his own funeral, insisting that he be dressed in a red kimono and placed in an open-top coffin for the mourners to see, with his friend Yvette Flunder doing his corpse's makeup. He wanted Tracy to sing at his funeral, accompanied by choirs and many flowers. The whole affair took place in his church, the Love Center, with a sermon being provided by Reverend Walter Hawkins. The event was packed, with standing room only, and the coffin was subsequently taken and buried at his family's plot in Inglewood Park Cemetery. An album titled Immortal was posthumously released; it contained Sylvester's final studio recordings, and was compiled by Marty Blecman.|$|E
5|$|Grinsell {{was born}} in London on 14 February 1907. With his family, he moved to Brighton shortly after the First World War. There, his {{interest}} in archaeology was encouraged by H. S. Toms, the curator of Brighton Museum who had formerly been an assistant to the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers. Moving back to London, in 1925 Grinsell became a clerk for Barclays Bank. Although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> his interest in prehistory through an examination of stone tools, he came to focus his attention on barrows, recognising that these were among the least well understood prehistoric monuments in the British landscape {{and one of the}} few that could be studied from the position of an amateur. At the time, a number of antiquarians were still active in southern England, with Grinsell being encouraged in his interests by prominent figures in this milieu such as Eliot Curwen and Hadrian Allcroft.|$|E
5|$|In April 1942, the German Commanding General in Serbia, General der Artillerie (General) Paul Bader, issued orders giving unit numbers C39 to C101 to the Pećanac Chetnik detachments, {{which were}} put {{under the command}} of the local German {{division}} or area command post. These orders also required the deployment of a German liaison officer with all detachments engaged in operations, and limited their movement outside their assigned area. Supply of arms and ammunition was also controlled. In July 1942, Mihailović arranged for the Yugoslav government-in-exile to denounce Pećanac as a traitor. His continuing collaboration ruined what remained of the reputation <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>developed</b> in the Balkan Wars and World War I.|$|E
