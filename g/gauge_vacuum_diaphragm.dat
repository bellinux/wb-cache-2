5000|$|A lung is {{composed}} of many small sacks called alveoli that allow oxygen and carbon dioxide to diffuse {{in and out of}} the blood respectively as the blood is passed through small capillaries that surround these alveoli. Surface tension is exploited by alveoli by means of a surfactant that is produced by one of the cells and released to lower the surface tension of the fluid coating the inside of the alveoli to prevent these sacks from collapsing. Huh [...] and his fellow researchers created a lung mimic that replicated the function of native alveolar cells. An extracellular matrix of gel, human alveolar epithelial cells, and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were cultured on a polydimethylsiloxane membrane that was bound in a flexible <b>vacuum</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> Pressurization cycles of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> which simulated breathing, showed similar form and function to an actual lung.

40|$|Abstract. The hot-filament <b>vacuum</b> <b>gauge</b> is a {{traditional}} <b>gauge</b> for the <b>vacuum</b> measurement below 10 - 1 Pa. It consists of the cathode, grid and anode. The cathode is used to emit the electron to collide with a gaseous molecular to form a pair of ion and electron.

Unlike the traditional gauge with the large dimension, this paper develops a CMOS-compatible hot-filament <b>vacuum</b> <b>gauge.</b> With it, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>gauge</b> and its control circuit can be fabricated monolithically on a chip which will decrease the noise and be easy to use. Besides that, the optimal heating current for the cathode is also considered in this paper. The electro-thermal modeling using COMSOL software is introduced to calculate the heating current for cathode. The results show that for 200 µm× 5 µm× 0. 2 µm tungsten resistor, 200 mA current is needed to heat the tungsten resistor to 1800 °C to emit the electron...|$|R

Gribov noted that this is crucial for gluon confinement, since a mass gap precisely means that the field fluctuations are of a bounded size. This insight played a crucial role in Feynman's semi-quantitative explanation for the confinement phenomenon in 2+1 dimensional nonabelian gauge theory, a method which was recently extended by Karbali and Nair into a fully quantitative description of the 2+1 dimensional nonabelian <b>gauge</b> <b>vacuum.</b>|$|R

40|$|Lattice Monte Carlo {{studies in}} SU(3) gauge theory {{have shown that}} the topological charge {{distribution}} in the vacuum is dominated by thin coherent membranes of codimension one arranged in a layered, alternating-sign sandwich. A similar lamination of topological charge occurs in the 2 D CP^N- 1 model. In holographic QCD, the observed topological charge sheets are naturally interpreted as D 6 branes wrapped around an S_ 4 [...] With this interpretation, the laminated array of topological charge membranes observed on the lattice can be identified as a "tachyonic crystal", a regular, alternating-sign array of D 6 and D̅ 6 ̅ branes that arises as the final state of the decay of a non-BPS D 7 brane via the tachyonic mode of the attached string. In the gauge theory, the homogeneous, space-filling D 7 brane represents the perturbative <b>gauge</b> <b>vacuum,</b> which is unstable toward lamination associated with a marginal tachyonic boundary perturbation ∝cos(X/√(2 α')). For the CP^N- 1 model, the cutoff field theory can be cast as the low energy limit of an open string theory in background gauge and tachyon fields A_μ(x) and λ(x). This allows a detailed comparison with large N field theory results and provides strong support for the tachyonic crystal interpretation of the <b>gauge</b> theory <b>vacuum.</b> Comment: 21 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

Only a direct calculation of the Gasser-Leutwyler coefficient combination 2 L 8 − L 5 can resolve the issue.
