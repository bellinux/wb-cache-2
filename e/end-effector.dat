25|$|The {{study of}} motion {{can be divided}} into {{kinematics}} and dynamics. Direct kinematics refers to the calculation of end effector position, orientation, velocity, and acceleration when the corresponding joint values are known. Inverse kinematics refers to the opposite case in which required joint values are calculated for given end effector values, as done in path planning. Some special aspects of kinematics include handling of redundancy (different possibilities of performing the same movement), collision avoidance, and singularity avoidance. Once all relevant positions, velocities, and accelerations have been calculated using kinematics, methods from the field of dynamics are used to study the effect of forces upon these movements. Direct dynamics refers to the calculation of accelerations in the robot once the applied forces are known. Direct dynamics is used in computer simulations of the robot. Inverse dynamics refers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to create a prescribed <b>end-effector</b> acceleration. This information can be used to improve the control algorithms of a robot.|$|E

[...] Avoiding these singularities is naturally of great interest, and several techniques have been proposed. [...] David Bailey and others have argued (in patents and in academic publications) that merely avoiding the [...] "divide by zero" [...] error that is associated with these singularities is sufficient. Two more recent patents summarize competing approaches. See also: Gimbal Lock.|$|E
