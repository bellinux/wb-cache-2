40|$|The {{effect of}} low (0. 08 microU g- 1 body wt min- 1) and high (0. 16 microU g- 1 body wt min- 1) rates of {{vasopressin}} infusion on blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> normal liver tissue and to liver metastases derived from azoxymethane induced colorectal carcinomas was studied in 36 male Wistar rats. Portal venous flow {{was measured by}} electromagnetic flowmetry and blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> normal and metastatic liver tissue by the clearance of xenon- 133 injected directly into the liver parenchyma or metastasis. The low rate of vasopressin infusion decreased portal venous flow but increased blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> normal and metastatic liver tissue while at the higher rate of infusion these effects were reversed. Hepatic artery ligation (HAL) immediately following a low rate of vasopressin infusion abolished the observed increase in blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> both normal liver tissue and metastases. HAL immediately following the higher rate of vasopressin infusion further reduced blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> metastases but did not further alter blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> normal liver tissue. HAL prior to the infusion of the vasoactive drug significantly reduced blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> metastatic liver tissue, increased portal venous flow and was without effect on blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> normal liver tissue. Following HAL, blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> metastatic liver tissue was not further altered by either the low or high rates of vasopressin infusion. However, blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> normal liver tissue after HAL was reduced by a low rate of infusion of vasopressin and increased by the higher rate of infusion. The {{results of this study}} indicate that blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> normal or metastatic liver tissue can be increased or decreased by differential rates of infusion of vasopressin. These observations may have important implications in the treatment of liver metastases in man where different rates of vasopressin infusion may potentiate the effects of hepatic artery ligation or cytotoxic therapy...|$|R
5|$|Downstream from {{confluence}} of the Drina, the Sava River changes its eastward course to northeast, until it reaches Sremska Mitrovica, from where it <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> the southeast and then south to Šabac, before finally turning east towards Belgrade. Most of the river's course in Serbia represents a border between province of Vojvodina, on the left bank, and Central Serbia, on the right bank. Exceptions to that are in area around Sremska Mitrovica, where both banks are in Vojvodina, and downstream of Progar suburb of Belgrade where both banks are in Central Serbia. The river meanders and forms wetlands in there as well—the most significant wetland among them centering on Obedska bara oxbow lake.

5|$|Fish have a {{closed-loop}} circulatory system. The heart pumps {{the blood}} in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> the gills for oxygenation.|$|E
5|$|Mangrove trees {{cover the}} coastlines of South Florida, {{sometimes}} growing inland {{depending on the}} amount of salt water present within the Everglades ecosystems. During drier years when less fresh water <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> the coast, mangroves will appear among fresh water plants. When rain is abundant, sawgrass and other fresh water plants may be found closer to the coast. Three species of mangrove trees—red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa)—can be found in the Everglades. Due to their high tolerance of salt water, winds, extreme tides, high temperatures, and muddy soils, mangrove trees are uniquely adapted to extreme conditions. They act as nurseries for many marine and bird species. They are also Florida's first defense against the destructive forces of hurricanes, absorbing flood waters and preventing coastal erosion. The mangrove system in Everglades National Park is the largest continuous system of mangroves in the world.|$|E

By Day 19 of pregnancy, blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> the gravid uterine horn had returned to a level similar to that observed on Day 13. Blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> both uterine horns of pregnant cows remained constant from Days 19 to 25 and then increased to the gravid horn (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) markedly until Day 30 whereas blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> the non-gravid horn remained low. Uterine blood flow during the oestrous cycle of non-pregnant cows was positively correlated (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) with systemic concentrations of oestradiol and the ratio of oestradiol (pg/ml) to progesterone (ng/ml).

During quiet breathing, blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> the costal diaphragm (25. 1 +/- 13. 9 ml/ 100 g/min) exceeded blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> the parasternal intercostals (18. 0 +/- 10. 2 ml/ 100 g/min, p < 0. 05). Inspiratory resistive loading abolished these differences by increasing blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> the parasternal intercostals more than to the diaphragm. Aminophylline (40 mg/kg) significantly increased minute ventilation and tidal transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) swing during quiet breathing but not during inspiratory resistive loading. Theophylline did not affect diaphragmatic blood flow during inspiratory resistive loading while the same Pdi swing and tension-time index (TTdi) were reached. During quiet breathing, however, theophylline significantly (p < 0. 05) increased blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> the triangularis sterni from 7. 9 +/- 5. 6 to 18. 1 +/- 25. 6 ml/ 100 g/min and to the transversus abdominis from 10. 8 +/- 8. 4 to 14. 6 +/- 10. 5 ml/ 100 g/min and tended <b>to</b> increase blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> the costal diaphragm and the parasternals.

5|$|All winds on Venus are {{ultimately}} driven by convection. Hot air {{rises in the}} equatorial zone, where solar heating is concentrated, and <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> the poles. Such an almost-planetwide overturning of the troposphere is called Hadley circulation. However, the meridional air motions are much slower than zonal winds. The poleward limit of the planet wide Hadley cell on Venus is near ±60° latitudes. Here air starts to descend {{and returns to the}} equator below the clouds. This interpretation is supported by the distribution of the carbon monoxide, which is also concentrated in the vicinity of ±60° latitudes. Poleward of the Hadley cell a different pattern of circulation is observed. In the latitude range 60°–70° cold polar collars exist. They are characterised by temperatures about 30–40K lower than in the upper troposphere at nearby latitudes. The lower temperature is probably caused by the upwelling of the air in them and by the resulting adiabatic cooling. Such an interpretation is supported by the denser and higher clouds in the collars. The clouds lie at 70–72km altitude in the collars—about 5km higher than at the poles and low latitudes. A connection may exist between the cold collars and high speed midlatitude jets in which winds blow as fast as 140m/s. Such jets are a natural consequence of the Hadley–type circulation and should exist on Venus between 55–60° latitude.|$|E
