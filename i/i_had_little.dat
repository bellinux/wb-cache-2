25|$|World War <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> effect, good or bad, on {{the college}} and though some people on campus {{contracted}} influenza during the Spanish flu epidemic, there were no deaths. In February 1919, the Young Men's Christian Association attempted a peaceful takeover of the college, offering to raise an endowment of $500,000 if Antioch would serve as the official national college of the YMCA. The YMCA proposal was received positively by the college's trustees and enacted by a unanimous vote, and Grant Perkins, a YMCA executive, assumed the college's presidency. By May, Perkins had resigned, reporting {{that he was not}} prepared to raise the necessary funds.|$|E
500|$|Cage {{underwent}} {{an artistic}} {{crisis in the}} early 1940s. His compositions were rarely accepted by the public, and he grew more and more disillusioned {{with the idea of}} art as communication. He later gave an account of the reasons: [...] "Frequently I misunderstood what another composer was saying simply because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> understanding of his language. And I found other people misunderstanding what I myself was saying when I was saying something pointed and direct". At the beginning of 1946, Cage met Gita Sarabhai, an Indian musician who came to the United States concerned about Western influence on the music of her country. Sarabhai wanted to spend several months in the US, studying Western music. She took lessons in counterpoint and contemporary music with Cage, who offered to teach her for free if she taught him about Indian music in return. Sarabhai agreed and through her Cage became acquainted with Indian music and philosophy. The purpose of music, according to Sarabhai's teacher in India, was [...] "to sober and quiet the mind, thus rendering it susceptible to divine influences", and this definition became one of the cornerstones of Cage's view on music and art in general.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, Argentina {{benefited from the}} {{recruitment}} of prominent German aerospace scientists and engineers, fleeing Europe following {{the defeat of the}} Nazis and seeking sanctuary in Latin America. The first group of these refugees had also included French designer Émile Dewoitine, castigated as a collaborator in his homeland, who headed the IAe 27 Pulqui I experimental fighter program with Argentine engineers Juan Ignacio San Martín, Enrique Cardeilhac and Norberto L. Morchio. The Pulqui I was the first jet aircraft designed and built in Latin America. In 1947, flight tests revealed a mediocre performance resulting in the cancellation of the IAe 27 program. The Aerotechnical Institute (...) , under the leadership of Morchio, persevered with its efforts to build a successful indigenous jet fighter and, at first, attempted to modify the earlier aircraft. When it became apparent that the Pulqui <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> potential for further development, the Aerotechnical Institute initiated a new design utilizing the more powerful (...) Rolls-Royce Nene II turbojet engine. In early 1948, the Institute completed a scale model of what it called the IAe-27a Pulqui II. This design featured trapezoidal wings, swept back at an angle of 33°, and used a NACA 16009 laminar flow airfoil section. A revised model was built later that year with the wings relocated to a shoulder-mounted position and the tailplane changed to a T-tail configuration.|$|E
