40|$|Obtaining the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>flows</b> in {{transportation}} networks based on optimizing users&# 039; cost {{is one of}} the important problems in urban transportation planning. Therefore, finding accurate <b>equilibrium</b> <b>flows</b> in a short time is a significant issue. The required time to solve the traffic equilibrium problem and the accuracy of the obtained results depend on the information level about the transportation system. Using more detail increases the cost of data collection and, dimensions of the problem and, therefore, creates difficulties in solving it. Certainly, a detail level of data should be proportional to the accuracy level that is required. Collecting additional data does not necessarily improve the accuracy level of the results and may only increase the design costs. In this paper, the sensitivity analysis of the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>flows</b> in traffic assignment models with respect to changes in some important transportation network attributes is considered. These attributes include: the accuracy level in measuring link specifications (e. g., width), diversity of travel time functions, intersection delay functions, the method of connecting the zone centroids to a transportation network and number of traffic zones...|$|R
40|$|The {{consideration}} of delay at signalized intersections improves {{the accuracy of}} <b>equilibrium</b> <b>flows</b> obtained from traffic assignment models. This delay depends not only on physical specifications of the intersection, intersection signal timing, and traffic volume and its composition but on drivers&# 039; behavior and specific traffic culture in each country. This paper proposes a delay function for traffic assignment models, which considers the special drivers&# 039; behavior in Iran. Unlike the existing models such as the Highway Capacity Manual model, the proposed delay function has modest data requirements on intersection characteristics, and this ensures the easy use of this function in a real traffic assignment model. To evaluate the proposed function in a real network, the traffic assignment model {{of the city of}} Mashhad, Iran is used. In two different scenarios, the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>flows</b> obtained when the proposed function is applied and those obtained when a simple uniform delay function is used are compared to the observed traffic flows.

In this article, a Physarum-inspired model for the probit-based stochastic user equilibrium problem is proposed. There are two main contributions of our work.

A parametric analysis shows that there are values of the equilibrium velocity field for which the absorption rate becomes zero, even for rather small velocity shears.
