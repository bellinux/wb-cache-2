5|$|Several {{groups of}} temnospondyls have large bony plates on their backs. One temnospondyl, Peltobatrachus, has armour-like plating that covers both its back and underside. The temnospondyl Laidleria also has {{extensive}} plating on its back. Most {{members of the}} family Dissorophidae also have armor, although it only covers the midline of the back with two narrow rows of plates. Other temnospondyls, such as <b>Eryops,</b> have been found with small, disc-like bony scutes that were in life probably embedded in the skin. All of these temnospondyls were adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle. Armor may have offered protection from predators in the case of Peltobatrachus. The scutes may have provided stability for the spine, as they would have limited flexibility and may have been connected by strong ligaments. Temnospondyls, such as Sclerothorax and <b>Eryops,</b> that may have been at least partly terrestrial also have long neural spines on top of their vertebrae that would have stabilized the spine. Bony scutes are also seen in plagiosaurs, but unlike Peltobatrachus, Laidleria, <b>Eryops,</b> and dissorophids, these animals are thought to have been fully aquatic. Plagiosaurs may have inherited their armor from a terrestrial ancestor, as both Peltobatrachus and Laidleria have been considered close relatives of the group.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} from an aquatic, lobe-finned fish to an air-breathing amphibian {{was a significant}} and fundamental one in the evolutionary history of the vertebrates. For an organism {{to live in a}} gravity-neutral aqueous environment, then colonize one that requires an organism to support its entire weight and possess a mechanism to mitigate dehydration, required significant adaptations or exaptations within the overall body plan, both in form and in function. <b>Eryops,</b> an example of an animal that made such adaptations, refined many of the traits found in its fish ancestors. Sturdy limbs supported and transported its body while out of water. A thicker, stronger backbone prevented its body from sagging under its own weight. Also, through the reshaping of vestigial fish jaw bones, a rudimentary middle ear began developing to connect to the piscine inner ear, allowing <b>Eryops</b> to amplify, and so better sense, airborne sound.|$|E
5|$|By the Visean (mid-Carboniferous) stage, {{the early}} {{tetrapods}} had radiated into {{at least three}} or four main branches. Recognizable basal-group tetrapods {{are representative of the}} temnospondyls (e.g. <b>Eryops)</b> lepospondyls (e.g. Diplocaulus), anthracosaurs, which were the relatives and ancestors of the Amniota, and possibly the baphetids, which are thought to be related to temnospondyls and whose status as a main branch is yet unresolved. Depending on which authorities one follows, modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) are most probably derived from either temnospondyls or lepospondyls (or possibly both, although this is now a minority position).|$|E
5|$|In 2000, paleontologists Adam Yates and Anne Warren {{produced}} a revised phylogeny of more derived temnospondyls, naming several new clades. Two major clades were Euskelia and Limnarchia. Euskelia includes the temnospondyls {{that were once}} called rhachitomes and includes two subfamilies, the Dissorophoidea and the Eryopoidea. Dissorophoids include small, mostly terrestrial temnospondyls {{that may be the}} ancestors of modern amphibians. Eryopoids include larger temnospondyls like <b>Eryops.</b> The second major clade, Limnarchia, includes most Mesozoic temnospondyls, as well as some Permian groups. Within Limnarchia are the superfamily Archegosauroidea and the most derived temnospondyls, the stereospondyls.|$|E
25|$|He {{developed}} an early interest in both fishes {{and the land}} vertebrates, publishing papers on both groups, including two in Science in 1903. By 1911 he had expanded his interests to encompass amphibians with a paper on the limb structure of the Permian <b>Eryops.</b> Despite his heavy workload he served {{as editor of the}} American Museum Journal (which would later become Natural History). He was formally appointed to the scientific staff at the American Museum of Natural History in 1911 and became part of the teaching faculty at Columbia in 1916, eventually rising to the post of Da Costa Professor in the Department of Zoology. His notable students included Alfred Romer, James Chapin, C.L Camp, and G.K. Noble. He was similarly successful at the museum, becoming full curator of three departments and serving as Chairman of two.|$|E
500|$|Other {{animals that}} would later be {{classified}} as temnospondyls were placed in a group called Ganocephala, which was characterized by plate-like skull bones, small limbs, fish-like scales, and branchial arches. Unlike labyrinthodonts, {{they did not have}} parietal foramena, [...] small holes in their skulls behind their eye sockets. Archegosaurus, [...] Dendrerpeton, <b>Eryops</b> and Trimerorhachis were placed in this group and were considered to be the most primitive members of Reptilia. Their rhachitomous vertebrae, notochord, and lack of occipital condyles (which attached the head to the neck) were features that were also shared with fishes. Thus, they were considered a link between early fishes and more advanced forms such as stegocephalians.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, most of {{what are}} today {{regarded}} as temnospondyls were placed in the suborder Labyrinthodonta. The American paleontologist Ermine Cowles Case called it Labyrinthodonta vera or [...] "true labyrinthodonts". The names Stegocephalia and Labyrinthodontia were used interchangeably to refer to the order in which it belonged. The labyrinthodontian suborders Microsauria and Branchiosauria, both of which contain temnospondyls, were distinct from Labyrinthodonta. Within Labyrinthodonta were the groups Rhachitomi, Labyrinthodonti, and Embolerimi. Members of Rhachitomi, such as Archegosaurus and <b>Eryops,</b> had rhachitomous vertebrae with enlarged intercentra that displaced the pleurocentra. Labyrinthodonti, such as Mastodonsaurus, Trematosaurus, and Micropholis, had lost their pleurocentra, and the intercentra made up the entire body of the vertebrae. Embolerimi had intercentra and pleurocentra that were of equal size. Embolomeres are now identified as reptiliomorphs distantly related to temnospondyls.|$|E
500|$|Fossils of Dimetrodon {{are known}} from the United States (Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Ohio) and Germany, areas {{that were part of}} the supercontinent Euramerica during the Early Permian. Within the United States, almost all {{material}} attributed to Dimetrodon has come from three geological groups in north-central Texas and south-central Oklahoma: the Clear Fork Group, the Wichita Group, and the Pearce River Group. Most fossil finds are part of lowland ecosystems which, during the Permian, would have been vast wetlands. In particular, the Red Beds of Texas is an area of great diversity of fossil tetrapods, or four-limbed vertebrates. In addition to Dimetrodon, the most common tetrapods in the Red Beds and throughout Early Permian deposits in the southwestern United States, are the amphibians Archeria, Diplocaulus, <b>Eryops,</b> and Trimerorhachis, the reptiliomorph Seymouria, the reptile Captorhinus, and the synapsids Ophiacodon and Edaphosaurus. These tetrapods made up a group of animals that paleontologist Everett C. Olson called the [...] "Permo-Carboniferous chronofauna," [...] a fauna that dominated the continental Euramerican ecosystem for several million years. Based on the geology of deposits like the Red Beds, the fauna is thought to have inhabited a well-vegetated lowland deltaic ecosystem.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Eryops</b> {{were among}} the most {{formidable}} early Permian carnivores and perhaps the only ones capable of competing with the dominant synapsids of the time, though because they were semi-aquatic, if not mostly aquatic, as suggested by long bone microanatomy, they probably did not come into frequent competition with synapsids. [...] <b>Eryops</b> lived in lowland habitats in and around ponds, streams, and rivers, and the arrangement and shape of their teeth suggests that they probably ate mostly large fish and aquatic tetrapods. The torso of <b>Eryops</b> was relatively stiff and the tail stout, which would have made them poor swimmers.

5000|$|<b>Eryops</b> is {{currently}} thought to contain only one species, E. megacephalus, which means [...] "large-headed Eryops". E. megacephalus fossils {{have been found}} only in rocks dated to the early Permian period (Sakmarian age, about 295 million years ago) in the southwestern United States, primarily in the Admiral Formation of Texas. During the mid-20th century, some older fossils were classified as a second species of <b>Eryops,</b> E. avinoffi. This species, known from Carboniferous period fossil found in Pennsylvania, had originally been classified in the genus Glaukerpeton. Beginning in the late 1950s, some scientists concluded that Glaukerpeton was too similar to Eyrops to deserve its own genus. However, later studies supported the original classification of Glaukerpeton, finding {{that it was more}} primitive than <b>Eryops</b> and some other early temnospondyls. Supposed <b>Eryops</b> fossils also found in older Pennsylvanian epoch rocks of the Conemaugh Group in West Virginia also turned out to be remains of Glaukerpeton. In 2005, a skull clearly belonging to <b>Eryops</b> was found in upper Pennsylvanian epoch rocks of the El Cobre Canyon Formation in New Mexico, representing the oldest known specimen.|$|E

50|$|Parioxys is an extinct genus of temnospondyl {{amphibian}} {{from the}} Early Permian of Texas. The genus includes the type species Parioxys ferricolus, named by paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1878, and the species Perioxys bolli, named by paleontologist Robert L. Carroll in 1964. Parioxys was first {{classified as a}} close relative of <b>Eryops,</b> another temnospondyl from Texas, and was later assigned to the family Trematopidae. In 1955, Parioxys was placed as the sole member of the newly erected family Parioxyidae.

50|$|The {{skeleton}} of <b>Eryops</b> {{was much more}} strongly built and sturdy than related temnospondyls. The limbs were especially large and strong. The pectoral girdle was highly developed, with a larger size for increased muscle attachments. Most notably, the shoulder girdle was disconnected from the skull, resulting in improved terrestrial locomotion. The crossopterygian cleithrum was retained as the clavicle, and the interclavicle was well-developed, lying {{on the underside of}} the chest. In primitive forms, the two clavicles and the interclavicle could have grown ventrally in such a way as to form a broad chest plate, although such was not the case in <b>Eryops.</b> The upper portion of the girdle had a flat scapular blade, with the glenoid cavity situated below performing as the articulation surface for the humerus, while ventrally there was a large flat coracoid plate turning in toward the midline.|$|E

50|$|The Ada Formation is a {{geologic}} formation in Oklahoma, within and to west of Ada. It consist mainly of shale with numerous limestone layers which get thinner and eventually disappear to the south, {{where they are}} replaced by fine-grained sandstone. Fossils are rare.

50|$|These Mountains {{are home}} to world famous Early Permian trackways of {{invertebrates}} and vertebrates. The main locality was recently designated the 100th active national monument in the United States, and named Prehistoric Trackways National Monument. Rock outcrops in the area preserve numerous examples of Early Permian trackways. These trackways include prints of Dimetrodon, Edaphosaurus, <b>Eryops,</b> Cacops and many other small pelycosaurs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Eryops</b> {{averaged}} {{a little over}} 1.5 - 2.0 m long and could grow up to 3 m, making them among the largest land animals of their time. Adults weighed about 90 kg. The skull was proportionately large, being broad and flat and reaching lengths of 60 cm. It had an enormous mouth with many curved teeth. Its teeth had enamel with a folded pattern, leading to its early classification as a [...] "labyrinthodont" [...] ("maze toothed"). The shape and cross section of <b>Eryops</b> teeth made them exceptionally strong and resistant to stresses. The palate, or roof of the mouth, contained three pairs of backward-curved fangs, and was covered in backward-pointing bony projections {{which would have been}} used to trap slippery prey once caught. This, coupled with the wide gape, suggest an inertial method of feeding, in which the animal would grasp its prey and thrust forward, forcing the prey farther back into its mouth.|$|E
5000|$|Limnarchia is a clade of temnospondyls. It {{includes}} the mostly Carboniferous-Permian age Dvinosauria and the mostly Permian-Triassic age Stereospondylomorpha. The clade was named in a 2000 phylogenetic analysis of stereospondyls and their relatives. Limnarchia means [...] "lake rulers" [...] in Greek, {{in reference to}} their aquatic lifestyles and long existence over a span of approximately 200 million years from the Late Carboniferous to the Early Cretaceous. In phylogenetic terms, Limnarchia is a stem-based taxon including all temnospondyls {{more closely related to}} Parotosuchus than to <b>Eryops.</b> It is the sister group of the clade Euskelia, which is all temnospondyls more closely related to <b>Eryops</b> than to Parotosuchus. Limnarchians represent an evolutionary radiation of temnospondyls into aquatic environments, while euskelians represent a radiation into terrestrial environments. While many euskelians were adapted to life on land with strong limbs and bony scutes, most limnarchians were better adapted for the water with poorly developed limbs and lateral line sensory systems in their skulls.|$|E
5000|$|Platyhystrix {{may have}} been preyed upon by larger temnospondyls such as <b>Eryops,</b> or by larger {{carnivorous}} reptiles, which were becoming more common and diverse in the drier climate of the Permian.
