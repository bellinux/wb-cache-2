40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation was {{the development of a}} test that would readily identify the potential of an aggregate to cause <b>D-cracking</b> because of its susceptivity to critical saturation. A Press-Ur-Meter was modified by replacing the air chamber with a one-inch diameter plastic tube calibrated in milli-. It was concluded that the pore index was sufficiently reliable to determine the <b>D-cracking</b> potential of limestone aggregates in all but a few cases where marginal results were obtained. Consistently poor or good results were always in agreement with established service records or concrete durability testing. In those instances where marginal results are obtained, the results of concrete durability testing should be considered when making the final determination of the <b>D-cracking</b> susceptibility of the aggregate in question. The following applications for the pore index test have been recommended for consideration: concrete durability testing be discontinued in the evaluation process of new aggregate sources with pore index results between 0 - 20 (Class 2 durability) and over 35 (Class 1) durability; composite aggregates with intermediate pore index results of 20 - 35 be tested on each stone type to facilitate the possible removal of low durability stone from the production process; and additional investigation should be made to evaluate the possibility of using the test to monitor and upgrade the acceptance of aggregate from sources associated with <b>D-cracking...</b>|$|E
40|$|Concrete {{pavements}} containing {{coarse aggregate}} derived from {{certain types of}} sedimentary rocks, mainly limestone and dolomite, and exposed to a freeze-thaw (FT) environment may develop a series of closely spaced parallel cracks (D-cracks) located near the transverse and longitudinal joints. <b>D-cracking</b> resistance of aggregates is influenced by its microstructural properties and mineralogy. However, {{it is still not}} fully understood how each of these factors relates to FT durability of the aggregate. ^ The main objective {{of the study was to}} assess the influence of mineralogy, crystal/grain size, type of porosity, and content of non-carbonate minerals on <b>D-cracking</b> resistance of coarse carbonate aggregates quarried in the state of Indiana. The <b>D-cracking</b> resistance of aggregates was evaluated by two methods: (a) standard Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) freeze-thaw test (ITM 210) performed on concrete beams containing the aggregate in question and (b) modified Hydraulic Fracture Test (HFT). ^ Eighteen sets of coarse aggregate samples were collected from fourteen quarries in the state of Indiana. The samples included aggregates from different geological formations, with a range of <b>D-cracking</b> performance characteristics: durable, non-durable and variable (or unknown). In addition to previously mentioned <b>D-cracking</b> resistance evaluation, representative samples from each of the aggregate sources were thoroughly characterized with respect to their mineralogical and porosity characteristics by performing such tests as: specific gravity, absorption, determination of acid insoluble residues, X-Ray powder diffraction (XRPD analysis), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), thin section petrographic analysis, dynamic vapor sorption analysis (DVS), scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP) analysis. An attempt was then made to relate the results of these tests to aggregate <b>D-cracking</b> performance, in order to identify how it is influenced by the basic characteristics of the source material. ^ The results of the basic characterization tests revealed that the aggregates used in the study belonged to one of the three different mineralogical categories: (a) calcite (limestone), (b) dolomite, and (c) dolomitic limestone. The <b>D-cracking</b> resistance (FT durability) of dolomite aggregates is influenced by the type of its porosity (interparticle, intercrystal, channel porosity etc.), the size of crystals and the presence of non-carbonate minerals such as pyrite and microcrystalline quartz. The relative proportions of the carbonate mud matrix and the grains (fossils) influence the FT performance of calcite (limestone) aggregates. Specifically, limestone aggregates containing relatively high (more than 90 %) amounts of carbonate mud matrix tend to be not FT durable. Similarly, dolomite aggregates consisting mainly of small (less than 50 microns) crystals tend to have low <b>D-cracking</b> resistance. On the other hand, dolomite aggregates with porous microstructure are FT durable. The test results also showed that aggregates having large (above 25 %) percentage of fine (below 80 nm diameter) pores tend to be susceptible to FT problem irrespective of their mineralogy. Finally, the study also revealed that the presence of clay and microcrystalline quartz in the intercrystalline pores negatively impacts the freeze-thaw resistance of aggregates. ^ Statistical analyses were performed to develop linear regression models to predict percent dilation and durability factor (DF) (the main performance characteristics of the freeze-thaw test (ITM 210)) using the variables obtained from the modified HFT results. The models developed in the study predicted the FT performance of the aggregates with high certainty. The use of the modified HFT equipment developed during this study, combined with the test procedures and analysis methods described in this thesis, will allow for reduction of the testing time required to assess the <b>D-cracking</b> resistance of carbonate aggregates quarried in Indiana from the current 90 -days (as per ITM 210 test method) to 8 days. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} the evaluation of frost resistance of concrete bridge decks with stay-in-place galvanized steel deck forms. The evaluation included specific aspects related to the potential for <b>D-cracking</b> in concrete bridge decks with these forms. The experimental program has been set up so that the real parameters of the bridge deck overlays and the environmental conditions could have been modeled. The program included freezing-and-thawing testing of large concrete slab specimens (22 ¼” x 17 ¼” x 5 ¼”) situated in a computer-controlled environmental chamber and of small specimens (3 ” x 4 ” x 12 ”) immersed in water situated in a freezing-and-thawing machine. The following tests have been carried out: relative ultrasonic pulse velocity, expansion of small specimens, weight changes of small specimens. Relative humidity and moisture content have been measured for controlling the moisture state of concrete. The {{results of this study suggest}} that corrugated steel deck forms may promote the damage of concrete made with <b>D-cracking</b> coarse aggregate due to freezing-and-thawing action. The coarse <b>D-cracking</b> aggregate may by itself cause cracking and scaling of concrete bridge decks with or without steel deck forms...|$|E

In this study, textural changes of sludge extrudates submitted to convective drying are followed by a 3 D image analysis of reconstructed X-ray microtomograms. To achieve this goal, two different wastewater sludges collected in wastewater treatment plant after the thickening step and dewatered in the laboratory are used. It is showed that the evolution of the 3 <b>D-crack</b> ratio vs. the residual water content evolves following a hyperbolic law. The 3 D opening crack size distribution reveals two different types of pore development, i. e. a continuous pore size evolution for one sludge and the sudden appearance of cracks for the other sludge.

40|$|About 16, 000 out of 17, 000 {{miles of}} the Illinois Department of Transportation’s {{pavements}} were originally constructed as either jointed plain concrete, jointed reinforced concrete, or continuously reinforced concrete. Many of these pavements have been rehabilitated or {{are in need of}} rehabilitation. Typical repair of all portland cement concrete pavements is to repair the broken and <b>D-cracked</b> sections with patches and overlay with bituminous concrete. Bituminous concrete overlays of PCC pavements usually begin to fail at the reflected joints and patched areas of the old concrete pavement, in addition to areas where the underlying concrete has continued to deteriorate. Rubblization eliminates joints and cracks that may reflect through a bituminous concrete overlay. Ten projects using the rubblization method have been constructed in Illinois, seven of which incorporated experimental features and were closely monitored. The construction and performance of these seven projects are presented in this report. Performance has been very good, with less reflective cracking than on adjacent patch and overlay sections...|$|R
40|$|A poroelastic {{model is}} {{developed}} that can predict {{stress and strain}} distributions and, thus, ostensibly damage likelihood in concrete under freezing conditions caused by aggregates with undesirable combinations of geometry and constitutive properties. Sensitivity of the stress distributions to the aggregate and matrix constitutive parameters are assessed to allow improved concrete design. The proposed model {{does not account for}} the viscoelastic stress relaxation and may over-predict the stress results. The model is evaluated experimentally through acoustic emission analysis under freeze-thaw cyclic loading, which reveals that air-entrained concrete may undergo durability cracking (<b>D-cracking)</b> if deleterious materials are present. It is determined that high-porosity, low-permeability aggregates with fine pore structure are the most vulnerable to <b>D-cracking</b> in non-air-entrained concrete, and the destructive tensile stress is generated at the aggregate boundary by the Mandel-Cryer effect. On the other hand, low-porosity, high-permeability aggregates relax the pore liquid pressure rapidly and prove to be beneficial for the non-air-entrained concrete. Reduction in aggregate size is found to be effective in quickly relaxing the tensile tangentia...|$|E

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{results from}} 2 field sites, {{which include a}} total of 18 test sections in Minnesota and Ohio. The sites were monitored for long-term performance to verify the effectiveness of freeze-thaw resistance technology. The performance monitoring included annual distress surveys and physical testing of cores taken from the concrete slabs at both sites. Wave velocity was measured at joints at the Ohio site to evaluate some treatments for <b>D-cracking</b> mitigation. The field test sites were installed in 1992 {{as a part of}} Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP) Contract C- 203, “Resistance of Concrete to Freezing and Thawing. ” The purpose of both installations was to validate the current frost resistance technology for new concrete in a field environment. In addition, at the Ohio site an additional evaluation was conducted to examine the effectiveness of methods to treat existing D-cracked concrete pavements to mitigate the effect of future <b>D-cracking.</b> Results from the field and laboratory testing over a 6 -year period after construction (1992 to 1998) showed very little visual distress at the surface or physical distress of portland cement concrete (PCC) cores taken from the interior portions of the test sections.

40|$|Tunneling cracks {{driven by}} drying in a ceramic {{precursor}} confined between two glass plates represent a simple type of three-dimensional (3 D) crack pattern. They arrange themselves via mutual unloading which causes some cracks to stop whereby the remaining ones {{get the right}} spacing for further propagation. By extending a 2 D-model of self-driven propagation of crack arrays, a fracture mechanical bifurcation analysis for 3 <b>D-crack</b> patterns based on calculating the post-critical contour of the alternating bifurcation mode has been developed. Shrinkage due to drying is replaced here by a simplified thermo-mechanical model based on an effective heat flow whose related temperature field and thermal stresses drive crack propagation. By means of the finite element method, the propagation velocity and the minimum spacing between the steady-state parallel tunnelling cracks are determined. Comparison of theory and experiment suggests that propagation may be non-stationary in these experiments. The observed relation between crack spacing and layer thickness, p similar to e(2 / 3), follows from a scaling analysis...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{miles of}} U. S. Highway 20 in Webster County {{began to show}} {{deterioration}} in 1990. Any deterioration was unexpected, since the road was just constructed in 1986 and 1987. The deterioration looked much like the staining and cracking of <b>D-cracking.</b> Cracking was found on 391 joints throughout the 10 mile four lane divided highway. Evaluation of cores from the project reveal low air contents at those locations where cracking is occurring. The cause of the low air contents can only be speculated on. A possible cause may be the vibration from the paver coupled with the additional vibration at the joints. Other projects constructed in 1986 and 1987 with the same equipment show no signs of distress...|$|E

From the data collected and the analysis performed to date, the following conclusions can be made regarding the ground penetrating radar system used for this study: (1) steel reinforcement can be accurately located; (2) pavement thickness can be determined; (3) distressed areas in pavements can be located and broadly classified as to severity of deterioration; (4) voids under pavements can be located; and (5) higher resolution recording equipment is required to accurately determine both the thickness of sound pavement remaining over distressed areas and the depth of void areas under pavements...|$|E
40|$|Pavement {{preservation}} and rehabilitation {{have been growing}} in importance nationwide, {{which has led to}} increased interest in concrete overlays. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a report on the performance of concrete overlays in Iowa. Pavement condition data such as the international roughness index (IRI), transverse cracking, longitudinal cracking, <b>D-cracking,</b> spalled joints, and faulting has been collected on Iowa roadways since 2002. From this data, a determination of the pavement condition index (PCI) is made. By comparing key concrete overlay parameters, such as overlay type, thickness, age, and joint spacing, with IRI and PCI performance data, long-term performance trends can be established to complete the first major concrete overlay performance study of its kind. A summary of results showed that Iowa’s overlays performed very well, with service life trends exceeding previously defined expectations for concrete overlays. Further investigation of outlying data from poorly performing projects showed distress tended to be based on a combination of project-specific material- and construction-related issues rather than inherent overlay design issues. Addressing the causes of these issues may further improve the performance life of concrete overlays...|$|E
40|$|The Iowa DOT {{has been}} using rapid {{freezing}} in air and thawing in water to evaluate coarse aggregate durability in concrete since 1962. Earlier research had shown that the aggregate pore system was {{a major factor in}} susceptibility to <b>D-cracking</b> rapid deterioration. There are cases were service records show rapid deterioration of concrete containing certain aggregates on heavily salted primary roads and relatively good performance with the same aggregate in secondary pavements with limited use of deicing salt. A five-cycle salt treatment of the coarse aggregate prior to durability testing has yielded durability factors that correlate with aggregate service records on heavily salted primary pavements. X-ray fluorescence analyses have shown that sulfur contents correlate well with aggregate durabilities with higher sulfur contents producing poor durability. Trial additives that affect the salt treatment durabilities would indicate that one factor in the rapid deterioration mechanism is an adverse chemical reaction. The objective· of the current research is to develop a simple method of determining aggregate susceptibility to salt related deterioration. This method of evaluation includes analyses of both the pore system and chemical composition...|$|E
40|$|Iowa {{has more}} than 13, 000 miles of portland cement {{concrete}} (PCC) pavement. Some pavements have performed well for over 50 years, while others have been removed or overlaid due to the premature deterioration of joints and cracks. Some of the premature deterioration is classical <b>D-cracking,</b> which is attributed to a critically saturated aggregate pore system (freeze-thaw damage). However, some of the premature deterioration is related to adverse chemical reactivity involving carbonate coarse aggregate. The objective {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate the value of a chemical analysis of carbonate aggregate using X-ray equipment to identify good or poor quality. At least 1. 5 % dolomite is necessary in a carbonate aggregate to produce a discernible dolomite peak. The shift of the maximum-intensity X-ray diffraction dolomite d-spacing can be used to predict poor performance of a carbonate aggregate in PCC. A limestone aggregate with a low percentage of strontium (less than 0. 013) and phosphorus (less than 0. 010) would be expected to give good performance in PCC pavement. Poor performance in PCC pavement is expected from limestone aggregates with higher percentages (above 0. 05) of strontium...|$|E
40|$|Portland cement {{concrete}} pavements have given excellent service history for Iowa. Many of these pavements placed during the 1920 ’s and 1930 ’s {{are still in}} service today. Many factors go in to achieve a long term durable concrete pavement. Probably {{the most important is}} the durability of the aggregate. Until the 1930 ’s, pit run gravel was the most predominant aggregate used. Many of these gravels provided long term performance and their durability is dependent upon the carbonate fraction of the gravel. Later, limestone (calcium carbonate) and dolomite (calcium, magnesium carbonate) sources were mined across Iowa. The durability of these carbonate aggregates is largely dependent upon the pore system which can cause freeze thaw problems known as <b>D-cracking,</b> which was a problem with some sources during the 1960 ’s. Also, some of these carbonate aggregates are also susceptible to deterioration from deicing salts. Geologists have identified the major components that affect the durability of these carbonate aggregates and sources are tested to ensure long term performance in Portland {{cement concrete}}. Air entrainment was originally put in concrete to improve scaling resistance. It is well known that air entrainment is required to provide freeze thaw protection in concrete pavements today. In Iowa, air entrainment was not introduced in concrete pavements until 1952. This research investigates properties that made older concrete pavements durable without air entrainment...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of recycled concrete aggregate vary some from virgin aggregates, but typically {{not enough to}} undermine the benefits of their use. Because recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) particles are comprised of reclaimed virgin aggregate and/or mortar, {{they tend to be}} more angular and rough than typical virgin aggregates, and their properties are slightly different. RCA typically has a higher absorption capacity, lower specific gravity, greater mass loss in tests such as L. A. abrasion and sodium and magnesium sulfate, and higher chloride content than virgin aggregates. Even still, RCA aggregates typically must meet the same requirements as virgin aggregates for the target application, even if the RCA is produced from a concrete pavement with a materials-related distress such as <b>D-cracking</b> or alkali-silica reactivity (ASR). Other concerns with RCA are precipitate potential and surface dust/contaminants, both of which might be considered during the design phase. More about these topics is available in ACPA’s EB 043 P, “Recycling Concrete Pavements. ” RCA must generally meet the same requirements as virgin aggregate for the target application. A summary and comparison of the some typical {{properties of}} virgin and recycled concrete aggregates is presented in Table 1. There are some clear differences in the physical, mechanical and chemical properties of typical virgin aggregate and RCA, mainly because of the inclusion of reclaimed mortar in the RCA. Most of these differences, however, require little (if any) consideration or procedural adjustment for use in typical applications...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the performance of HMA overlays in Illinois. The service life of the overlays is affected by a variety of factors that were examined in this study.

40|$|Premature {{deterioration}} of joints in concrete pavements is reportedly {{a problem in}} cold weather regions. Distress is often first observed as shadowing when microcracking near joints traps water followed by loss of materials around the joints. It is also seen as cracks parallel to the saw cut. Although not all pavements are distressed, the problem is common enough to warrant attention. The goal {{of this study was}} to improve understanding of the mechanisms behind premature joint deterioration in concrete pavements. Objectives of this study were to (1) conduct laboratory freeze-thaw tests to investigate the effect of concrete interfacial zone to the deterioration, (2) evaluate the influence of pore structure of cement paste to the freeze-thaw durability using mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) tests, and (3) use of a borehole permeameter to conduct a field study to assess the influence of the permeability of subsurface layers on joint performance. Laboratory freeze-thaw tests results revealed that the concrete interfacial zone likely contributes to the accelerated {{deterioration of}} concrete pavement joints. MIP tests results showed that hardened cement paste with a w/cm ratio typically used in pavements has a pore size distribution similar to that of aggregates prone to <b>D-cracking.</b> The field investigation showed that impermeable base layers are likely contributing to joint deterioration. The field investigation indicated that subsurface layers of concrete pavements in winter are significantly less permeable than in summer because when water that is trapped in the subsurface freezes, excess water cannot drain out of the pavement so increasing concrete saturation and so risk of freezing related damage. Both laboratory and field studies indicate that a combination of multiple factors (e. g., materials, design, and construction) causes the deterioration of concrete...|$|E
40|$|For many decades, {{degradation}} of concrete by freezing actions {{has been a}} primary interest of research for civil engineers. Past studies mostly relied on expensive and time-consuming experimental or semi-empirical investigations to identify the source of damage that is attributable to substandard aggregates, inadequate entrained air content, highly porous mortar or cement matrix, and use of deicing salts. Theoretical works developed in recent years do not incorporate all these factors in one single model. Very recently, concrete has gained widespread popularity as a cheap alternative to traditional material utilized for containing liquefied natural gas (LNG). Most studies documenting concrete behavior at cryogenic temperatures are obscure. Therefore, poroelastic theory, capable of incorporating aggregate and mortar properties, pore solution characteristics, air void spacing, and environmental exposure has been utilized to model damage triggering stresses and strain in concrete used for two purposes: 1) concrete pavement exposed to freezing and thawing cycles, and 2) concrete walled tanks containing LNG. The solid-liquid phase transformation equilibrium has been redeveloped to demonstrate the effect of pore solution speciation and disjoining pressure on the deformation of freezing concrete. The modeled trends are in good agreement with experimental results obtained from literature. It {{has been found that}} the damage initiating tensile stresses, exhibited at the aggregate-matrix boundary for both the air-entrained and non-air-entrained concrete can be exacerbated by the Mandel-Cryer effect induced by the delayed relaxation of the pore pressure from the aggregate center. The model suggests that high-porosity, low-permeability aggregates are the most vulnerable to <b>D-cracking.</b> Concrete with low-porosity, low-permeability mortar matrix, typical of mortar containing supplementary cementitious materials and/or low water to cement ratio, can withstand freezing deformation even with a spacing factor larger than the recommended value. In addition, thermodynamic analysis shows that the disjoining force favors crystal growth, while the dissolved ions suppress the freezing point but are still capable of building high hydraulic pressure in the pore network. We believe that implementation of these models will help practitioners select appropriate combinations and proportions of concrete mixture constituents to build safe, economic, and durable concrete structures...|$|E
