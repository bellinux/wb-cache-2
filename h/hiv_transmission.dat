40|$|Introduction: Successful global {{treatment}} as prevention (TasP) requires identifying HIV-positive individuals {{at high risk for}} transmitting HIV, and having impact via potential infections averted. This study estimated the frequency and predictors of numbers of <b>HIV</b> <b>transmissions</b> and bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) acquisition among sexually active HIV-positive individuals in care from three representative global settings. Methods: HIV-positive individuals (n= 749), including heterosexual men, heterosexual women and {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) in HIV care, were recruited from Chiang Mai (Thailand), Rio De Janeiro (Brazil) and Lusaka (Zambia). Participants were assessed on HIV and STI sexual transmission risk variables, psychosocial characteristics and bacterial STIs at enrolment and quarterly for 12 months (covering 15 months). Estimated numbers of <b>HIV</b> <b>transmissions</b> per person were calculated using reported numbers of partners and sex acts together with estimates of HIV transmissibility, accounting for ART treatment and condom use. Results: An estimated 3. 81 (standard error, (SE) = 0. 63) <b>HIV</b> <b>transmissions</b> occurred for every 100 participants over the 15 months, which decreased over time. The highest rate was 19. 50 (SE= 1. 68) for every 100 MSM in Brazil. In a multivariable model, country×risk group interactions emerged: in Brazil, MSM had 2. 85 (95 % CI= 1. 45, 4. 25, p< 0. 0001) more estimated transmissions than heterosexual men and 3. 37 (95 % CI= 2. 01, 4. 74, p< 0. 0001) more than heterosexual women over the 15 months. For MSM and heterosexual women, the combined 12 -month STI incidence rate for the sample was 22. 4 % (95 % CI= 18. 1 %, 27. 3 %; incidence deemed negligible in heterosexual men). In the multivariable model, MSM had 12. 3 times greater odds (95 % CI= 4. 44, 33. 98) of acquiring an STI than women, but this was not significant in Brazil. Higher alcohol use on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (OR= 1. 04, 95 % CI= 1. 01, 1. 08) was also significantly associated with increased STI incidence. In bivariate models for both <b>HIV</b> <b>transmissions</b> and STI incidence, higher depressive symptoms were significant predictors. Conclusions: These data help to estimate the potential number of HIV infections transmitted and bacterial STIs acquired over time in patients established in care, a group typically considered at lower transmission risk, and found substantial numbers of estimated <b>HIV</b> <b>transmissions.</b> These findings provide an approach for evaluating the impact (in phase 2 studies) and potentially cost-effectiveness of global TasP efforts...|$|R
5|$|Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs {{more often}} in lesbians, but it is unclear if BV is {{transmitted}} by sexual contact; it occurs in celibate as well as sexually active women. BV often occurs in both partners in a lesbian relationship; {{a recent study of}} women with BV found that 81% had partners with BV. Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of human immunodeficiency virus (<b>HIV)</b> <b>transmission,</b> although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions. The highest rate of transmission of HIV to lesbians is among women who participate in intravenous drug use or have sexual intercourse with bisexual men.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of <b>HIV</b> <b>transmission</b> by {{approximately}} 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E

5|$|The {{second most}} {{frequent}} mode of <b>HIV</b> <b>transmission</b> is via blood and blood products. Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, needle stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63 and 2.4% per act, {{with an average}} of 0.8%. The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act. In the United States intravenous drug users made up 12% of all new cases of HIV in 2009, and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV positive.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{intercourse}} is {{the major}} mode of <b>HIV</b> <b>transmission.</b> Both X4 and R5 HIV {{are present in the}} seminal fluid, which is passed from a male to his sexual partner. The virions can then infect numerous cellular targets and disseminate into the whole organism. However, a selection process leads to a predominant transmission of the R5 virus through this pathway. In patients infected with subtype B HIV-1, there is often a co-receptor switch in late-stage disease and T-tropic variants appear that can infect a variety of T cells through CXCR4. These variants then replicate more aggressively with heightened virulence that causes rapid T cell depletion, immune system collapse, and opportunistic infections that mark the advent of AIDS. Thus, during the course of infection, viral adaptation to the use of CXCR4 instead of CCR5 may be a key step in the progression to AIDS. A number of studies with subtype B-infected individuals have determined that between 40 and 50 percent of AIDS patients can harbour viruses of the SI and, it is presumed, the X4 phenotypes.|$|E
5|$|Personal traits such as age, gender, location, and {{education}} correlate, either positively or negatively, with HIV/AIDS awareness levels. For example, older women have demonstrated {{higher levels of}} knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS than younger women in Malawi. Because men typically have greater access to education and other social resources, they are often more knowledgeable about HIV prevention and transmission than women. While men are, on average, able to list 2.2 ways to prevent <b>HIV</b> <b>transmission,</b> women are only able to list 1.5 ways. Only 38% of women surveyed in 2003-2004 understood that their husbands {{would be less likely}} to contract HIV if they used condoms during intercourse with prostitutes and other women from high-risk groups. In addition, men who are raised in urban environments are, on average, more informed about HIV/AIDS than men who are raised in rural environments, presumably because urban children typically have greater access to educational resources than rural children. Among both men and women, higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about HIV/AIDS: men and women who have received secondary school educations are significantly more likely to understand complex aspects of the disease, such as the fact that people who appear healthy can still be HIV-positive, than those who have not. Finally, people who have lost friends or family members to the disease are likely to have greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS due to their personal, firsthand exposure to the problem.|$|E

40|$|Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) {{have brought}} about a global {{epidemic}} far more extensive than was predicted even a decade ago (van Rensburg, 2002 : 1). South Africa {{has one of the}} highest HIV prevalence rates in the world (South African Department of Health, 2000 : 5), it still increase yearly. Before a vaccine and/or effective treatment become available, effective education and information campaigns are necessary for preventing the spreading of HIV and AIDS (WHO (the World Health Organization), 1988 : 21). According to WHO and ICN (International Council of Nurses) (1988 : 12), Nurses can play a pivotal role in the education of patients, their families and friends with regard to the prevention of <b>HIV</b> and AIDS <b>transmission,</b> so as to control the spread of this disease. In South Africa, more than 60 percent of the healthcare human resources comprise professional nursing practitioners (Muller, 2002 : 95). Therefore, the education and training of nurses is one of the effective methods to preventing further spread of HIV and AIDS infection in South Africa. Accordingly, nurses need to reduce both personal and occupational risk of becoming infected with HIV themselves, as well as provide education to patients and their families. Before effective and efficient in-service education guidelines on the prevention of <b>HIV</b> and AIDS <b>transmission</b> can be developed, any knowledge deficit and negative attitudes of registered nurses regarding the prevention of <b>HIV</b> and AIDS <b>transmission</b> should be identified. Thus, it is important to survey the knowledge and attitudes of nurses in healthcare institutions related to the prevention of <b>HIV</b> and AIDS <b>transmission.</b> The main goal of the study was to explore and describe the knowledge and attitudes of registered nurses in public hospitals related to the prevention of <b>HIV</b> and AIDS <b>transmission.</b> The secondary objective was to develop in-service education guidelines for registered nurses in public hospitals to optimise both personal and occupational prevention measures relating to <b>HIV</b> and AIDS <b>transmission.</b> The research was conducted using a quantitative, explorative, descriptive and contextual design. The purposive sampling method was used to select the participants and a self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. This data was analysed by inferential statistics and descriptive statistics and areas of deficits concerning knowledge and negative attitudes were identified. In this study there were deficits concerning the knowledge and negative attitudes regarding the prevention of <b>HIV</b> and AIDS <b>transmission</b> to a greater or lesser degree in all the subgroups of the questionnaire. In general, the registered nurses with the attendance of HIV and AIDS training program, experience in caring for HIV and AIDS patients made the level of certain knowledge related to the prevention of <b>HIV</b> and AIDS <b>transmission</b> different; Working experience as a registered nurses and the attendance of HIV and AIDS training programmes did not make attitudes towards the prevention of <b>HIV</b> and AIDS <b>transmission</b> significantly different. The registered nurses with experience of caring for HIV and AIDS patients had more positive attitudes than those without the experience. This information was used to compile in-service education guidelines for registered nurses concerning the prevention of <b>HIV</b> and AIDS <b>transmission.</b> The in-service education guidelines will be given to clinical facilitators at public hospitals.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To examine {{surveillance}} data {{for evidence of}} changing sexual behaviour and continuing transmission of HIV- 1 among {{men who have sex}} with men. DESIGN [...] Analytic study of {{surveillance data}} on sexually transmitted diseases. SETTING [...] England and Wales. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Number of cases of rectal gonorrhoea and newly diagnosed HIV infection in homosexual men. RESULTS [...] New cases of gonorrhoea among men attending genitourinary medicine clinics increased by 7. 7 % in 1989 and by 4. 2 % in 1990. Reports of rectal isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae also rose and the male to female ratio for patients with rectal gonorrhoea changed from 0. 3 : 1 during 1988 - 9 to 2. 6 : 1 in 1990 - 1. Although the overall number of cases of acute hepatitis B fell during 1988 - 91, 81 and 82 homosexual men were infected in 1990 and 1991 respectively compared with 50 and 42 in 1988 and 1989. 1526 men had HIV- 1 infection diagnosed in 1991, the largest number since 1987. Twenty eight of the 97 (29 %) men who seroconverted between January 1989 and December 1991 were aged less than 25. The proportion of men aged 15 - 19 who were found to be infected with HIV- 1 at their first test increased from an average of 2. 4 % up to 1990 to 4. 7 % in the first nine months of 1991.

40|$|Introduction: The recent {{availability}} of efficacious prevention interventions among stable couples offers {{new opportunities for}} reducing HIV incidence in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding the dynamics of HIV incidence among stable couples is critical to inform HIV prevention strategy across sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We quantified the sources of HIV incidence arising among stable couples in sub-Saharan Africa using a cohort-type mathematical model parameterized by nationally representative data. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were incorporated. Results: HIV incidence arising among stable concordant HIV-negative couples contribute each year, on average, 29. 4 % of total HIV incidence; of those, 22. 5 % (range: 11. 1 %– 39. 8 %) are infections acquired {{by one of the}} partners from sources external to the couple, less than 1 % are infections acquired by both partners from external sources within a year and 6. 8 % (range: 3. 6 %– 11. 6 %) are transmissions to the uninfected partner in the couple {{in less than a year}} after the other partner acquired the infection from an external source. The mean contribution of stable HIV sero-discordant couples to total HIV incidence is 30. 4 %, with most of those, 29. 7 % (range: 9. 1 %– 47. 9 %), being due to <b>HIV</b> <b>transmissions</b> from the infected to the uninfected partner within the couple. The remaining incidence, 40. 2 % (range: 23. 7 %– 64. 6 %), occurs among persons not in stable couples. Conclusions: Close to two-thirds of total HIV incidence in sub-Saharan Africa occur among stable couples; however, only half of this incidence is attributed to <b>HIV</b> <b>transmissions</b> from the infected to the uninfected partner in the couple. The remaining incidence is acquired through extra-partner sex. Substantial reductions in HIV incidence can be achieved only through a prevention approach that targets all modes of HIV exposure among stable couples and among individuals not in stable couples...|$|R
