50|$|The {{strength}} of the bond between the oxide and metal for the same nominal contact area can range from Pa to GPa stresses. The cause of this huge range stems from multiple phenomena dealing with at least four different types of adhesion. The main types of bonding that form adhesion are electrostatic, dispersive (van der Waals or London forces), chemical and diffusive bonding. As the adhesive forces increase, separation in crystalline materials can go from elastic <b>debonding</b> to elastic-plastic <b>debonding.</b> This {{is due to a}} larger number of bonds being formed or an increase in {{strength of}} the bonds between the two materials. Elastic-plastic <b>debonding</b> is when local stresses are high enough to move dislocations or make new ones.|$|E

40|$|Fiber/matrix {{interface}} cracking {{plays an}} important role in determining the final failureof unidirectional (UD) composites. When subjected to longitudinally tensile loading,fiber/matrix interface <b>debonds</b> originate from fiber breaks or initial defects propagatealong loading direction. Depending on the quality of fiber/matrix interface, debondscould keep growing longitudinally which leads to the degradation of compositestiffness or kink out of interface and connect with neighboring <b>debonds</b> or fiberbreaks that forms a so called critical fracture plane which leads to the final failure ofUD composite. For UD composite subjected to transversely tensile loading, theinitiation, growth and coalesce of arc-shape fiber/matrix interface <b>debonds</b> result inthe formation of macro-size transverse cracks, the propagation and multiplication ofthese transverse cracks, although would not directly lead to the final failure ofcomposite, could cause significant stiffness degradation of composite structures. In the presence thesis, the growth of a fiber/matrix interface <b>debond</b> of a UDcomposite with hexagonal fiber packing under longitudinal and transverse tensileloading was investigated numerically, with the special focus on the influence ofneighboring fibers. In the current study, energy release rate (ERR) is considered as thedriving force for the <b>debond</b> growth and was calculated based on J Integral andVirtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT) using finite element software ANSSY. Papers A – C in the present thesis deal with the influence of neighboring fibers on theERR of a <b>debond</b> emanating from a fiber break under longitudinal loading condition. In longitudinal loading case, <b>debond</b> growth is mode II dominated. In paper A, anaxisymmetric model consisting 5 concentric cylinders that represent broken fiber withdebond, surrounding matrix, neighboring fibers, surrounding matrix and effectivecomposite was generated. It’s found that there are two stages of <b>debond</b> growth, thefirst stage is when <b>debond</b> length is short, the ERR decreases with increasing debondlength, and the presence of neighboring fibers significantly increase the ERR ofdebond. For relatively long <b>debond,</b> the <b>debond</b> growth is steady when ERR is almostconstant regardless of <b>debond</b> length. In steady state of <b>debond</b> growth, the presenceof neighboring fibers have little effect on the ERR. In papers B and C, a 3 -D modelwas generated with broken fiber and its 6 nearest fibers in a hexagonal packed UDcomposite were modelled explicitly, surrounded by the homogenized composite. Based on the obtained results, it’s shown that ERR is varying along <b>debond</b> front, andhas its maximum at the circumferential location where the distance between two fibercenter is the smallest. This indicates that the <b>debond</b> front is not a circle. For steadystate <b>debond,</b> the presence of neighboring fibers have little effect on averaged ERR(averages of ERR along <b>debond</b> front). For short <b>debond,</b> the presences ofneighboring fibers increases the averaged ERR, and that increase is more significantwhen inter-fiber distance is the smallest. Paper D investigates the growth of afiber/matrix <b>debond</b> along fiber circumference under transverse loading. It’s foundthat <b>debond</b> growth in this case is mixed-mode, and both mode I and mode II ERRcomponents increase with increasing <b>debond</b> angle and then decreases. Debondgrowth is mode I dominated for small <b>debond</b> angle and then switch to mode IIdominated. The presence of neighboring fibers have an enhancement effect on debondgrowth up to certain small <b>debond</b> angle and then changes to a protective effect. InPaper E, the interaction between two arc-size <b>debond</b> under transverse loading isinvestigated. It’s found that when two <b>debonds</b> are close to each other, the interactionbetween two <b>debond</b> becomes much stronger, and that interaction leads to the increaseof ERR of each <b>debond</b> significantly, which facilitates further growth for bothdebond...|$|R

40|$|Fiber/matrix {{interface}} cracking {{plays an}} important role in determining the final failure of unidirectional composites. In the present study, energy release rate (ERR) for fiber/matrix interface <b>debond</b> growth originated from fiber break in unidirectional composite is calculated using 5 -cylinders axisymmetric and 3 -D FEM models with hexagonal fiber arrangement. In the model the <b>debonded</b> fiber is central in the hexagonal unit which is surrounded by effective composite. The effect of neighboring fibers focusing on local fiber clustering on the ERR is analyzed by varying the distance between fibers in the unit. Two different scenarios are considered, one is the steady-state <b>debond</b> where <b>debond</b> are long and thus there is no interaction between <b>debond</b> tip and fiber break; the other case is when <b>debond</b> are relatively short when <b>debond</b> tip interacts with fiber break. The steady-state ERR is calculated from potential energy difference between a unit in the bonded region far away from the <b>debond</b> front and a unit in the <b>debonded</b> region far behind the <b>debond</b> front. The ERR for different modes of crack propagation is obtained from a FEM model containing a long <b>debond</b> by analyzing the stress at the <b>debond</b> front. For very short <b>debonds,</b> the ERR was calculated by both the J integral and the Virtual crack closure technique (VCCT). For steady-state <b>debond</b> growth, results show that in mechanical axial tensile loading fracture Mode II is dominating, it has strong angular dependence (effect of closest fibers) but the average ERR is not sensitive to the local fiber clustering. In thermal loading the Mode III is dominating and the average ERR is highly dependent on the distance to neighboring fibers. For short debod growth, results show that the <b>debond</b> growth is Mode II dominated and that the ERR strongly depends on the angular coordinate. The local fiber clustering has larger effect on the angular variation for shorter <b>debonds</b> and the effect increases with larger local fiber volume fraction. Finally, the ERR values from 5 -cylinder axisymmetric model could be considered as upper bound for the 3 -D hexagonal model.

40|$|Characterizing failure {{behaviors}} of <b>debonded</b> composite sandwich structures under compressive loading Yi-Hsin Nieh, Yen-Kun Lai and Jia-Lin Tsai This research investigated the failure {{behaviors of}} the composite sandwich structures with face sheet and core <b>debond</b> subjected to compressive loading. Experiments and numerical simulations were conducted {{to determine the effects}} of the face sheet thick-ness and <b>debond</b> length on the compressive strength and failure mechanisms of the composite sandwich structures. Experimental results revealed that sandwich structures with either thicker face sheets or a shorter <b>debond</b> length exhibited a higher buckling load and greater failure strength. Moreover, when the <b>debond</b> length was short, failure was primarily caused by global buckling; conversely, when the <b>debond</b> length was long, failure was caused by local buckling and crack extension from the <b>debond</b> edge. To characterize the failure mechanism, a nonlinear finite element simulation of sandwich specimens containing imperfections was conducted. The simulation revealed that, when the dominant failure mode was global buckling, failure occurred at the intermediate portion of the foam core and strength could be characterized using the maximum principal strain criterion. However, when the failure mode was local buckling, failure was initiated at the <b>debond</b> tip, and strength could be predicted using the damage zone method...|$|R

The model includes a cohesive zone along one face sheet/core interface whereby the <b>debond</b> can extend by interface crack growth. Two geometrical imperfections are introduced; a global imperfection of the sandwich column axis and a local imperfection of the <b>debonded</b> face sheet axis. The model predicts the sandwich column to be very sensitive to the initial <b>debond</b> length and the local face sheet imperfection. The study shows that the sensitivity to the face sheet imperfection results from two mechanisms: (a) interaction of local <b>debond</b> buckling and global buckling and (b) {{the development of a}} damaged zone at the <b>debond</b> crack tip. Based on the pronounced imperfection sensitivity, the author predicts that an experimental measurement of the strength of sandwich structures may exhibit a large scatter caused by geometrical variations between test specimens...|$|R
50|$|The energy-balancing model {{applies the}} {{physical}} {{properties of the}} whole material to describe the microscopic behavior during triaxial stress. The volume stress and particle radius conditions for cavitation can be calculated, giving the theoretical minimum particle radius for cavitation, useful for practical applications in rubber toughening.Typically cavitation will occur when the average stress on the rubber particles is between 10 and 20 megapascal. The volume strain on the particle is relieved and voiding occurs. The energy absorption due to this increase in volume is theoretically negligible. Instead, it is the consequent shear band formation that accounts for increased toughness. Before <b>debonding,</b> as the strain increases, the rubber phases is forced to stretch further strengthening the matrix. <b>Debonding</b> between the matrix and the rubber reduces the toughness, creating the need for strong adhesion between the polymer and rubber phases.|$|E
