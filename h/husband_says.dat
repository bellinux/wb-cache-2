2500|$|Martha J. Cutter {{discusses}} how {{in many of}} Charlotte Perkins Gilman's works she addresses this [...] "struggle {{in which}} a male-dominated medical establishment attempts to silence women." [...] Gilman's works challenge {{the social construction of}} women in patriarchal medical discourse by displaying women as [...] "silent, powerless, and passive" [...] who refuse treatment. At the time in which her works take place, between 1840 and 1890, women were exceedingly defined as lesser than—sickly and weak. In this time period it was thought that [...] "hysteria" [...] (a disease stereotypically more common in women) was a result of too much education. It was understood that women who spent time in college or studying were over-stimulating their brains and consequently leading themselves into states of hysteria. In fact, many of the diseases recognized in women were seen {{as the result of a}} lack of self-control or self-rule. Different physicians argued that a physician must [...] "assume a tone of authority" [...] and that the idea of a [...] "cured" [...] woman is one who is [...] "subdued, docile, silent, and above all subject to the will and voice of the physician". A hysterical woman is one who craves power and in order for her to be treated for her hysteria, she must submit to her physician whose role is to undermine her desires. Often women were prescribed bed rest as a form of treatment, which was meant to [...] "tame" [...] them and basically keep them imprisoned. Treatments such as this were a way of ridding women of rebelliousness and forcing them to conform to social roles. In her works Gilman highlights that the harm caused by these types of treatments for woman i.e. [...] "the rest cure" [...] has to do with the way in which her voice is silenced. Paula Treichler explains [...] "In this story diagnosis 'is powerful and public[...] [...] [...] It is a male voice that [...] [...] [...] imposes controls on the female narrator and dictates how she is to perceive and talk about the world.' Diagnosis covertly functions to empower the male physician's voice and disempower the female patient's". The narrator in [...] "The Yellow Wallpaper" [...] is not allowed to participate in her own treatment or diagnosis and is completely forced to succumb to everything in which her doctor and in this particular story, her <b>husband,</b> <b>says.</b> The male voice is the one in which forces controls on the female and decides how she is allowed to perceive and speak about the world around her.|$|E
