25|$|Morphine was {{the most}} {{commonly}} abused narcotic analgesic in the world until heroin was synthesized and came into use. In general, until the synthesis of dihydromorphine (ca. 1900), the dihydromorphinone class of opioids (1920s), and oxycodone (1916) and similar drugs, {{there were no other}} drugs in the same efficacy range as opium, morphine, and heroin, with synthetics still several years away (pethidine was invented in Germany in 1937) and opioid agonists among the semi-synthetics were analogues and derivatives of codeine such as dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), <b>ethylmorphine</b> (Dionine), and benzylmorphine (Peronine). Even today, morphine is the most sought after prescription narcotic by heroin addicts when heroin is scarce, all other things being equal; local conditions and user preference may cause hydromorphone, oxymorphone, high-dose oxycodone, or methadone as well as dextromoramide in specific instances such as 1970s Australia, to top that particular list. The stop-gap drugs used by the largest absolute number of heroin addicts is probably codeine, with significant use also of dihydrocodeine, poppy straw derivatives like poppy pod and poppy seed tea, propoxyphene, and tramadol.|$|E

50|$|Benzylmorphine (Peronine) is a semi-synthetic opioid {{narcotic}} {{introduced to}} the international market in 1896 {{and that of the}} United States very shortly thereafter. It is much like codeine, containing a benzyl group attached to the morphine molecule just as the methyl group creates codeine and the ethyl group creates <b>ethylmorphine</b> or dionine (used as a generic name for that drug just as peronine is for benzylmorphine).

5000|$|The {{interaction}} of carisoprodol with essentially all opioids, and other centrally acting analgesics, but especially [...] {{those of the}} codeine-derived subgroup of the semisynthetic class (codeine, <b>ethylmorphine,</b> dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, nicocodeine, benzylmorphine, the various acetylated codeine derivatives including acetyldihydrocodeine, dihydroisocodeine, nicodicodeine and others) [...] which allows {{the use of a}} smaller dose of the opioid to have a given effect , is useful in general and especially where skeletal muscle injury and/or spasm is {{a large part of the}} problem. The potentiation effect is also useful in other pain situations and is also especially useful with opioids of the open-chain class, such as methadone, levomethadone, ketobemidone, phenadoxone and others. In recreational drug users, deaths have resulted from carelessly combining overdoses of hydrocodone and carisoprodol.

40|$|<b>Ethylmorphine</b> is metabolised by N-demethylation (to norethylmorphine) and by O-deethylation (to morphine).

To study further {{the features of}} <b>ethylmorphine</b> metabolism we investigated its N-demethylation and O-deethylation in human liver microsomes from eight extensive (EM) and one poor metaboliser (PM) of dextromethorphan. Whereas N-demethylation varied only two-fold there was a 4. 3 -fold variation in the O-deethylation of <b>ethylmorphine,</b> the lowest rate being observed in the PM. Quinidine, at a concentration of 1 microM, inhibited O-deethylation in microsomes from an EM, {{but was unable to}} do so in microsomes from the PM.

We conclude that the O-deethylation of <b>ethylmorphine</b> is catalysed by the CYP 2 D 6 in human liver microsomes consistent with previous findings in healthy volunteers...|$|E
