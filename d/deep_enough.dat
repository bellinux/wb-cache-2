5|$|In July 1940, Graf Zeppelin was towed from Kiel to Gotenhafen (Gdynia) and {{remained}} there {{for nearly a}} year. While there, she {{was used as a}} storage depot for Germany's hardwood supply. Just before Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the carrier was again moved, this time to Stettin, to safeguard her from Soviet air attacks. By November, the German army had pushed <b>deep</b> <b>enough</b> into Russian territory to remove any further threat of air attack and Graf Zeppelin was returned to Gotenhafen. There, she was used as a store ship for timber.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the {{epaulette}} shark extends from the southern coast of New Guinea to the northern coast of Australia, {{as far south as}} Sydney. The Capricorn-Bunker Group of the Great Barrier Reef contains a particularly large population, with thousands estimated to inhabit the reefs around Heron Island alone. Additionally, there are unsubstantiated reports of this species from Malaysia, Sumatra, and the Solomon Islands. Epaulette sharks are found in shallow water to a maximum depth of 50m (160ft), and are often seen in water barely <b>deep</b> <b>enough</b> to cover their bodies. They prefer tidal pools, coral flats, and stands of staghorn coral.|$|E
5|$|Substantial {{structural}} changes {{took place on}} January12: frontal boundaries separated from {{the core of the}} cyclone; convection developed atop the circulation; and it acquired a weak warm-core. All these factors, alongside the system being co-located with an upper-level low, indicated its transition into a subtropical cyclone by 18:00UTC. Upon doing so, the system received the name Alex. Though relatively shallow, owing to the seasonally low level of the tropopause, convection was deemed <b>deep</b> <b>enough</b> for classification. At this time, the subtropical storm was situated 1,150mi (1,850km) west-southwest of the Canary Islands. The trough that previously enabled the sharp southward turn later steered Alex to the east-northeast and later north-northeast. Operationally, Alex was not classified as a subtropical storm until late on January13.|$|E
5000|$|In 1808, Lieutenant Thomas Gedney of the United States Coast Survey {{discovered}} a new, deeper channel through The Narrows into New York Harbor. Previously, the passage was complex and shallow enough that loaded ships would wait outside the harbor until high tide, to avoid {{running into the}} huge sandbar, which was interrupted {{in a number of}} places by channels of fairly shallow depth: [...] at low tide and [...] at high tide. Because of the difficulty of the navigation required, since 1694, New York had required all ships to be guided into the harbor by an experienced pilot. The new channel Gedney discovered was [...] <b>deeper,</b> <b>enough</b> of an added margin that fully laden ships could come into the harbor even at slack tide. Gedney's Channel, as it came to be called, was also shorter than the previous channel, another benefit appreciated by the ship owners and the merchants they sold to. Gedney received the praise of the city, as well as an expensive silver service.|$|R

5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} {{has generally}} nocturnal habits and {{spends much of}} the day buried in the substrate. It has been known to follow the rising tide to forage in water barely <b>deep</b> <b>enough</b> to cover its body. This species preys upon small invertebrates, including crustaceans, annelid worms, and bivalve and gastropod molluscs, and bony fishes. It mainly targets benthic and burrowing organisms, but also opportunistically takes free-swimming prey. In Delaware Bay, this species feeds predominantly on the shrimp Cragon septemspinosa and the blood worm Glycera dibranchiata, and its overall dietary composition is virtually identical to that of the roughtail stingray (D.centroura), with which it shares the bay. The bluntnose stingray is preyed upon by larger fishes such as the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas). Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium brevissime and Kotorella pronosoma, the monogenean Listrocephalos corona, and the trematodes Monocotyle pricei and Multicalyx cristata.|$|E
5|$|The ice trade {{started with}} the {{harvesting}} of ice from ponds and rivers during the winter, to be stored for the summer months ahead. Water freezes in this way once it falls to a temperature of 40°F (5°C)and the surrounding air temperature drops to 32°F (0°C). Ice needed {{to be at least}} 18inches (0.46 m) thick to be harvested, as it needed to support the weight of the workers and horses and be suitable for cutting into large blocks. In New England, ponds and rivers typically had <b>deep</b> <b>enough</b> ice to harvest between January and March, while in Norway harvesting occurred between December and February. Natural ice could occur with different qualities; most prized was hard, clear crystal ice, typically consumed at the table; more porous, white coloured ice was less valuable and used by industry. With a good thickness of ice, around 1,000 tons (900,000kg) could be harvested from an acre (0.4 hectares) of surface water.|$|E
5|$|With {{more and}} more people coming to Aspen, a better road from the east was needed. An early {{investor}} in the city, B. Clark Wheeler, put up the money needed to improve the path over the pass to a stage road. It opened in November 1881, just as winter was beginning. The tolls, 25 cents for saddle horses and twice that for stages ($ and $ in modern dollars respectively) were primarily spent hiring a large crew of men who kept the pass clear in winter with snowshovels. They were able to keep the road through the pass open during its first five winters. In <b>deep</b> <b>enough</b> snow passengers switched to sleighs; in summer, dogs ran in advance to warn oncoming traffic through the pass itself as the stages took the switchbacks at full speed. It usually took a stage 10–25 hours and five changes of horses to reach Aspen from Twin Lakes.|$|E

50|$|Diogenites are {{composed}} of igneous rocks of plutonic origin, having solidified slowly <b>enough</b> <b>deep</b> within Vesta's crust to form crystals which are larger than in the eucrites.

5|$|Among {{the oldest}} rocks in Oregon, {{some of the}} {{formations}} in these terranes date to the Triassic, nearly 250million years ago. Between 165 and 170million years ago, in the Jurassic, faulting consolidated the Klamath terranes offshore during what geologists call the Siskiyou orogeny. This three- to five-million-year episode of intense tectonic activity pushed sedimentary rocks <b>deep</b> <b>enough</b> into the mantle to melt them and then forced them to the surface as granitic plutons. Belts of plutons, which contain gold and other precious metals, run through the Klamaths and include the Ashland pluton, the Grayback batholith east of Oregon Caves National Monument, the Grants Pass pluton, the Gold Hill pluton, the Jacksonville pluton, and others. Miners have worked rich deposits of gold, silver, copper, nickel, and other metals in several districts of the Klamaths. Placer mining in the mid-19thcentury soon led to lode mining for gold. Aside from a mine in eastern Oregon, the Greenback Mine along Grave Creek, a Rogue tributary, was the most productive gold mine in Oregon.|$|E
5|$|As an {{adaptation}} for navigating its complex reef environment, the epaulette shark moves by seemingly walking, bending its body from side-to-side and pushing {{off of the}} substrate with its paddle-shaped pectoral and pelvic fins. Its gait {{is similar to that}} of salamanders, an example of convergent evolution. The shark is capable of swimming, but often prefers to walk along the sandy or coral bottom even when the water is <b>deep</b> <b>enough</b> to allow it to swim freely. The cartilaginous supports of the epaulette shark's paired fins are reduced and separated when compared to other sharks, allowing them to be rotated for use as limbs. This mode of locomotion even enables the shark to crawl out of the water to access isolated tidal pools. The gait of the epaulette shark is convergently similar to those of tetrapods such as salamanders, suggesting that the movements needed for walking on land may predate, and facilitated the evolution of, the first terrestrial vertebrates. Epaulette sharks are largely nocturnal and are most active in low water. They often hide inside or below coral heads, though it is enough for the head to be covered even if the rest of the body is exposed. Sometimes they perch in the open on sandy flats or atop reefs facing into the current, a form of orientation known as rheotaxis that may improve respiration or predator awareness.|$|E
5|$|On 22 September Mack {{decided to}} hold the Iller line {{anchored}} on Ulm. In {{the last three days}} of September, the French began the furious marches that would place them at the Austrian rear. Mack believed that the French would not violate Prussian territory, but when he heard that Bernadotte's I Corps had marched through Prussian Ansbach, he made the critical decision to stay and defend Ulm rather than retreat to the south, which would have offered a reasonable opportunity at saving the bulk of his forces. Napoleon had little accurate information about Mack's intentions or maneuvers; he knew that Kienmayer's Corps was sent to Ingolstadt east of the French positions, but his agents greatly exaggerated its size. On 5 October Napoleon ordered Ney to join Lannes, Soult, and Murat in concentrating and crossing the Danube at Donauwörth. The French encirclement, however, was not <b>deep</b> <b>enough</b> to prevent Kienmayer's escape: the French corps did not all arrive at the same place– they instead deployed on a long west-east axis– and the early arrival of Soult and Davout at Donauwörth incited Kienmayer to exercise caution and evasion. Napoleon gradually became more convinced that the Austrians were massed at Ulm and ordered sizeable portions of the French army to concentrate around Donauwörth; on 6 October three French infantry and cavalry corps headed to Donauwörth to seal off Mack's escape route.|$|E

5|$|Walls' double {{continued}} his {{success as a}} pinch hitter, making him 13-for-26 with 12 runs batted in in such situations for the season. Don Larsen entered to relieve O'Dell, who had not recorded an out but had earned a blown save for his performance. Maury Wills hit a ground ball to the first baseman, who threw home {{in an attempt to}} put out Walls who slid hard into the Giants' catcher Haller. The slide, which cut Haller's arm <b>deep</b> <b>enough</b> to later require six stitches, caused him to drop the ball, leaving Walls safe on Haller's error and extending the Dodgers' lead to 7–5. John Orsino entered as the new catcher to replace the injured Haller. Wills then stole second, his 101st stolen base of the season, before the batter Gilliam saw a single pitch. Orsino's throw to try to catch Wills went past second base and into center field. Wills attempted to advance to third, but was thrown out by Willie Mays. Larsen then induced a flyball out by Gilliam and the inning was over. Between the two halves of the sixth the two teams had scored a combined 11 runs and used six pitchers, three pinch hitters, two defensive replacements, and a pinch runner.|$|E
5|$|Several basic {{offensive}} tactics {{come into}} play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating {{a gap in the}} infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even {{at the expense of the}} batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be <b>deep</b> <b>enough</b> to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.|$|E
