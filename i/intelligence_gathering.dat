5|$|In particular, <b>intelligence</b> <b>gathering</b> {{played a}} major role. Around 6,000 Belgian civilians were {{involved}} in gathering intelligence on German military installations and troop movements and communicating {{it back to the}} Allied armies. The organization was run through a large number of independent groups and included, notably, the large Dame Blanche (White Lady) network. Alongside <b>intelligence</b> <b>gathering</b> were similar organisations which helped men wishing to join the Belgian Army on the Yser Front escape occupied Belgium, usually to the neutral Netherlands. Around 32,000 were successfully smuggled out which boosted the size of the Belgian force considerably.|$|E

The AIB force continued to make guerilla attacks on Japanese positions until early October, when it was ordered to cease offensive operations and concentrate on <b>intelligence</b> <b>gathering</b> ahead of the landing of Australian infantry and support units at Jacquinot Bay. The AIB's operations from June to October were assisted by occasional air attacks and naval bombardments conducted by elements of the Allied air forces and navies.|$|E

However, having strong enough feelings (according to Yuri), he is able to regain his senses and manages to disappear like the others. He carries a Desert Eagle as a side-arm, but is also seen using a Sig 552.|$|E
5|$|An Australian naval vessel, HMAS Swan, {{under the}} command of Commander Arthur Bond (RN), {{conducted}} a reconnaissance and <b>intelligence</b> <b>gathering</b> mission in the Black Sea and territory of the Don Cossacks in December 1918, in conjunction with the French destroyer Bisson. The mission, conducted on behalf of the British military mission then advising the White Russian forces under General Denikin, was detailed to report to the true state of the Cossack forces and was carefully circumscribed by the British Foreign Office. Indeed, although the Cossacks fêted Commander Bond as a comrade-in-arms he had to explain to them that they were purely on an information gathering mission with the Australian vessel in no way intended to render military or naval aid to the Cossacks. After inspecting anti-Bolshevik forces in the area, as well as numerous military facilities and factories, Swan subsequently carried out anti-Bolshevik guard duties in Sevastopol, with the ship's guns helped protect the railway station {{at the head of the}} Inkerman valley. These duties were completed without incident and Swan subsequently sailed for Plymouth on 3 January 1919.|$|E

5|$|At 4:00p.m., two {{anti-tank}} teams {{joined the}} Sa'iqa {{company on the}} firing ramp. Both teams, along with the company, were ordered to advance eastward and seize the crossroads. At around 5:00p.m., the Israeli Air Force began attacking Egyptian forces in the fort and {{on the west bank}} of the canal. One group of four aircraft attempted to bomb the fort; the first aircraft dropped its payload of seven bombs, then descended to a low altitude to escape anti-aircraft fire. An anti-air platoon at the Kilometer 17 mark soon shot down an Israeli aircraft (either a Mirage III or an A-4 Skyhawk) with a Strela 2 missile, destroying it. Between 6:00 and 7:00p.m. all bunkers and troop shelters inside the fort were cleared, and the Egyptians transferred 26 Israeli prisoners to {{the west bank of the}} canal, and thereafter transferred them to Port Said for <b>intelligence</b> <b>gathering.</b> The Israelis concentrated heavy artillery fire against the fort, once they were sure it had been captured by the Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|German foreign <b>intelligence</b> <b>gathering,</b> {{large-scale}} Allied trench raids {{and observed}} troop concentrations west of Arras {{made it clear}} to the Germans that a spring offensive near Arras was being planned. In February 1917, a German-born Canadian soldier deserted to the German side and helped confirm many of the suspicions held by the Germans, providing them {{with a great deal of}} useful information. By March 1917, the German forces were aware that a major attack was imminent and would include operations aimed at capturing Vimy Ridge. General of Infantry Ernst August Marx von Bachmeister, commanding the German 79th Reserve Division, reported in late-March that he believed the Canadian Corps was moving into an echelon formation and were preparing for a major attack. The Germans quickly developed plans to launch a pre-emptive operation, following the adage that the best defence is a good offence, intent on capturing the northern section of the Zouave Valley along the northernmost portion of the Canadian front. Heavy Canadian Corps artillery fire ultimately prevented the Germans from executing their pre-emptive attack.|$|E
5|$|However, {{while no}} Australian units {{were engaged in}} {{operations}} there, many individuals did subsequently become involved through service with the British Army during the North Russia Campaign.

About 150 men of the Australian Imperial Force who were still in England awaiting repatriation following the end of World War I also enlisted as infantry in the North Russia Relief Force (NRRF), where they were involved in a number of sharp battles. The Royal Australian Navy was involved too, with the destroyer HMAS Swan briefly engaged in an <b>intelligence</b> <b>gathering</b> mission in the Black Sea in late 1918 on behalf of the British military mission then advising the White Russian general, Anton Denikin. There were several Australians acting as advisers with this mission as well, while several more served as advisers with Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia.|$|E
