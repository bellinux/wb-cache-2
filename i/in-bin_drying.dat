40|$|Three {{different}} corn types (yellow dent, waxy and white) {{were used}} {{in a set of}} desorption and adsorption equilibrium moisture content (EMC) experiments. The ranges of temperature and moisture content (MC) for the tests were 0 to 25 °C and 12 to 20 %. The main conclusion was that the three corn types investigated had different adsorption and desorption EMC relationships. These corn type specific relationships were incorporated into a new model-based fan and burner control strategy for the <b>in-bin</b> <b>drying</b> and conditioning of corn. This Self-Adapting Variable Heat (SAVH) strategy incorporated the Thompson equilibrium drying model to predict MC changes in different layers of the grain mass. The drying model allowed the SAVH control strategy to successfully identify wet or dry weather conditions and target a uniform final MC for the entire grain mass. ^ This SAVH control strategy was successfully implemented in three field experiments during the 2004 drying season. The Post-Harvest Aeration and Storage Simulation Tool–Finite Difference Method (PHAST-FDM) software was further refined and validated by comparing the observed MC values for four natural air/low temperature (NA/LT) <b>in-bin</b> <b>drying</b> experiments with the predicted MC values. ^ On the basis of a 40 -year analysis of weather data with respect to the performance of NA/LT <b>in-bin</b> <b>drying</b> systems, the Midwestern Corn Belt was divided into four regions. PHAST-FDM was used to study the performance of four NA/LT <b>in-bin</b> <b>drying</b> strategies for drying 20 % initial. ^ On the basis of a 40 -year analysis of weather data with respect to the performance of NA/LT <b>in-bin</b> <b>drying</b> systems, the Midwestern Corn Belt was divided into four regions. PHAST-FDM was used to study the performance of four NA/LT <b>in-bin</b> <b>drying</b> strategies for drying 20 % initial MC corn in 13 locations within these regions. The simulation results showed that the SAVH strategy outperformed the other strategies on the basis of drying costs (from 1. 1 to 9. 6 $/t lower drying cost), drying time, and relatively little overdrying of the grain bottom layer. The drying cost for the yellow dent corn type was always the lowest, followed by the white and then by the waxy corn types. ^ The fine material distribution in the grain mass and the air velocity through the core and periphery locations in the bin were quantified for 15 NA/LT <b>in-bin</b> <b>drying</b> field tests. The best management practices of leveling the grain peak after filling the bin and coring the grain mass were implemented, and the improvement on the airflow distribution was quantified. Simulation results showed that operators of NA/LT <b>in-bin</b> <b>drying</b> systems could reduce drying costs from 25 to 33 % by leveling the grain peak after loading the bin. An additional savings of 18 to 22 % could be achieved by installing effective grain (and fine material) distributors or by coring the grain mass. ...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a general}} study about the {{performance}} and energy requirement for NA/LT <b>in-bin</b> <b>drying</b> of corn at 10 different locations in Argentina. The goals {{of this study were}} to use the PHAST-FDM simulation model and historical weather data to study the performance of four NA/LT <b>in-bin</b> <b>drying</b> strategies for drying corn with different airflow rates (1 to 2 m 3 min- 1 t- 1) and from different initial moisture contents (MC) (17 and 20 %) in terms of drying time, final moisture content and dry matter loss, among other parameters. Additionally, the electrical and caloric energy consumption was also estimated. The most successful strategy across locations was the intelligent strategy (a model based strategy). The appropriate specific airflow rate was 2 m 3 min- 1 t- 1 in North Argentina and 1 m 3 min- 1 t- 1 in the South Argentina. In some locations with warm weather, no NA/LT <b>in-bin</b> <b>drying</b> strategy succeeded in drying corn with initial MC of 20 % or superior under the airflow rates ranges investigated in this study, mostly due to excessive dry matter loss. The location with the coldest weather (Balcarce) resulted with the highest total energy consumption per point of moisture extracted and per ton of grain, (35. 5 and 25. 1 kWh for 17 % and 20 % initial MC, respectively). On the contrary, the location with the warmest weather (Saenz Peña) resulted with the lowest total energy consumption, with 9. 4 and 10. 7 kWh per point of moisture extracted and per ton, for 17 % and 20 % initial MC, respectively.

40|$|Drying seed corn as ear-corn is {{a complex}} process, which {{traditionally}} depends on operator experience. Therefore, there is significant opportunity to improve the process in terms of preserving quality, minimizing cost, and/or maximizing capacity. A simulation model, based on heat and mass transfer, was used in a process optimization program. Optimal values of the initial bed-depth, the up-air and the down-air temperatures, the up-air and down-air airflows, and the reversal moisture content were calculated, using the Box complex method, for maximizing the capacity or for minimizing the energy cost of <b>in-bin</b> ear-corn <b>drying</b> at different initial product moisture contents. Operating the dryer under the capacity-optimization strategy increases the capacity by 26 - 43 % but also increases the cost by 25 - 33 %, compared to operating under the cost-minimization strategy.

40|$|High {{temperature}} and high relative humidity adversely affect {{the quality of}} seeds, and are features of tropical climate. Seed drying and storage are being used increasingly in developing countries to improve seed storage and quality. This study was undertaken to evaluate a range of seed drying methods and storage conditions with the view to selecting an appropriate method(s) for use in tropical countries. Pea (Pisum sativum L.) seeds at three initial seed moisture content (m. c.) of 23. 8, 18. 0 and 14. 5 % were dried to 10 % seed m. c. before storage. The performances of four different drying methods: artificial dryer (Kiwi Mini) set at 30 °C or 45 °C, natural sun <b>drying,</b> and <b>in-bin</b> natural ventilation <b>drying</b> were evaluated. Natural sun <b>drying,</b> and <b>in-bin</b> natural ventilation <b>drying</b> were conducted from March to May, 1997, when mean {{temperature and}} relative humidity during sunny days were 17 °C and 60 % respectively. The dried seeds were stored under two conditions: open storage at 20. 5 ° 0 and 55 % relative humidity (r. h.), and closed storage at 25 °C and 90 % r. h. for 20, 40, and 60 days. Time and energy consumed for drying by the different methods were determined to compare the drying efficiency when combined with quality of the seed. Deterioration of the seed due to storage conditions and drying methods used was determined by assessing their effects on seed germination, abnormal seedlings, dead seed, hollow heart percentages, and conductivity. Seed samples dried by the Kiwi Mini dryer set at 45 °C took 7 hours and those set at 30 °C took 17 hours. It took 54 hours with natural <b>in-bin</b> ventilation <b>drying,</b> while sun drying took 37 hours. However, energy consumed when drying seeds at 30 °C was 17 kWh, which was more than twice that at 45 °C. Seed germination was not significantly different between drying methods, but averaged only 75 % because of sprouting damage of the crop prior to harvest. Germinations after open and closed storage for 20 days did not differ, although some differences appeared after 40 days of storage. However, open and closed storage for 60 days significantly reduced seed germination to 54 and 33 % respectively. Because seeds are heat-sensitive, drying air temperature and drying rate are particularly important to avoid internal seed breakage, cracking and splitting, fungal growth, and loss of germination and vigour. Selected studies have shown that seed can be dried at high temperature for a short time, followed by tempering to re-distribute moisture and temperature inside the seed, thus reducing the percentage of cracking. Thus, a second experiment was conducted with maize (Zea mays L) to study the impact on seed viability of high temperature drying followed by tempering. Maize at 28. 5 % initial seed m. c. was dried at 60 °C for short periods of 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25 minutes, followed by tempering for 45 minutes at either 30 °C or 21 °C. This cycle was repeated until maize seeds were dried to 13. 0 % m. c [...] The percentage of cracked seeds, germination immediately after drying, and after an accelerated ageing test, did not differ between 30 °C and 21 °C tempering. Drying exposure times of up to 10 minutes per cycle at 60 °C caused vertical cracks in up to 50 % of seeds, but seed germination remained over 90 % and seed vigour was also maintained. The percentage of seeds with stress cracks due to high temperature drying (5 - 25 minute cycles) at 60 °C followed by tempering had polynomial relationships with seed germination and vigour. Seeds dried at the same temperature without tempering had their germination reduced from 99 to 20 %...|$|R
40|$|<b>In-bin</b> {{continuous}} flow <b>drying</b> {{has become a}} popular high speed method for on-farm grain drying. ln this system the grain bin is normally used as a combination wetholding and drying bin.

40|$|Natural air (NA), <b>in-bin</b> <b>drying</b> {{and storage}} of rough rice {{generally}} maintains high grain quality, but the associated slow movement and occasional stagnation of the drying front {{during the process}} may result in problems of rice quality reduction, mold growth, and mycotoxin development, especially for rough rice in the top layers of the bin. Using modeling techniques to simulate in-bin rough rice drying in typically-encountered field scenarios may provide a tool for rapidly predicting the grain condition as drying progresses. The objectives {{for this study were}} to (1) investigate accurate models for predicting equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of rough rice at set conditions of air temperature and relative humidity (RH), (2) develop and validate a mathematical model for predicting moisture content (MC) and temperature profiles of rough rice during NA, <b>in-bin</b> <b>drying,</b> and (3) perform computer simulations using the developed mathematical model to determine the impacts of drying strategy (rough rice initial MC, drying-start date, air flowrate, and fan control strategy) on rough rice drying duration, maximum dry matter loss, and percent overdrying. In order to accomplish objective (1), adsorption and desorption isotherms of long-grain hybrid rough rice at temperatures ranging from 15 °C to 35 °C and RHs of 10 % to 90 % were determined by using a Dynamic Vapor Sorption analysis device. Non-linear fitting techniques were used to determine constants of models for predicting rough rice adsorption or desorption EMCs. It was determined that the modified Halsey and modified Chung-Pfost equations were the best models to describe rough rice adsorption and desorption isotherms, respectively (RMSEs = 0. 54 % MC in dry basis and 0. 91 % MC in dry basis, respectively). To achieve objective (2), Post-Harvest Aeration Simulation Tool - Finite Difference Method, developed by Bartosik and Maier (2004), was modified for rice and used to simulate in-bin rough rice drying in Arkansas. Simulation results were validated by field experiments, which used modern, on-farm bins equipped with “cabling and sensing technology” for in-bin RH and rough rice temperature measurement; the rough rice MC was calculated based on the measured RH and temperature data. The sensor-determined data and simulation results of MC and temperature were compared. The simulation results described well the general trends of rough rice MC and temperature profiles (for MC, mean RMSE = 0. 56 % MC in wet basis; for temperature, mean RMSE = 1. 77 °C). The study validated the accuracy of the developed simulation model for prediction of <b>in-bin</b> <b>drying</b> and storage of rough rice. In order to accomplish objective (3), simulations of <b>in-bin</b> <b>drying</b> of rough rice with different drying strategies was performed. A twenty-year weather data set (1995 to 2014) of ambient air temperature and RH of the U. S. Mid-South rice growing locations (Jonesboro, West Memphis, and Stuttgart, Arkansas, and Greenville and Tunica, Mississippi) were procured. Drying simulations were performed using air flowrates 0. 55, 1. 10, 1. 65, and 2. 20 m^ 3 min-t^- 1, drying-start dates of 15 August, 15 September, and 15 October, and rough rice initial MCs of 16 % to 22 % (wet basis). Fan control strategies comprised running the drying fan continuously, at set window of natural air equilibrium moisture content, and air EMC window with supplemental heating option. Results showed that rough rice drying duration, dry matter loss, and percent overdrying were dependent on selected drying strategy with fan control strategy, initial rough rice MC, and air flowrate being key factors. Information generated using the simulations could guide rice producers, especially in selected U. S. Mid-South, to effectively dry rough rice in a timely manner, and mitigate problems of rice quality reduction, excessive mold growth, and mycotoxin contamination...|$|E
40|$|Batch-in-bin drying {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular on-farm grain drying {{technique}}s. The grain is dried daily in a batch usually 2. 5 to 4 feet deep in the drying bin and then cooled and moved to another storage bin in time for the next day's harvest. When the storage bins are full, the drying bin may be filled and the grain dried in layers if necessary. No wet grain storage is needed with this technique as the batch size constitutes one day's harvest. The basic principle behind the operation of a batch-in-bin dryer is to force relatively large quantities of air through a shallow grain depth so as to obtain a rapid drying speed, thus allowing the producer to accommodate larger harvest rates with other types of <b>in-bin</b> <b>drying.</b> Equipmen...|$|E

40|$|Experimental and {{computer}} simulation of <b>in-bin</b> grain <b>drying</b> was conducted. The {{study was to}} model the non-uniform distribution of temperature and moisture content in bins with slanted or partially perforated floors, hence with non-parallel airflow streamlines. Complete data were obtained for grain drying with non-parallel airflow. These data included moisture contents, temperatures, static pressures, intergranular air velocities, and shrinkage of the drying beds. The intergranular air velocities measured {{were found to be}} about three times those calculated from the superficial air velocity divided by the bulk porosity. The non-parallel airflow regions were more pronounced near the air entrance. A way from the entrance regions, the air velocity profile tended to be uniform. The partially perforated floor created higher resistance to airflow than the totally or slanted perforated floors. The drying pattern depended on the floor configuration. For the slanted floor, grain {{at the center of the}} bin remained undried at about 20 % moisture content when the average moisture content of the bin reached 14 % (w. b.). Typical bulk shrinkage of grain was about 20 % for grain dried from 22 % to 12 % moisture content. The shrinkage was non-uniform with the slanted floor. Grain shrinkage resulted in denser packing of the grain and an increase in the resistance to airflow. This increase was somewhat compensated for by a decrease in the grain bed depth. The net decrease in airflow supplied to the bin was about 13 %. An improved simulation scheme was developed to simulate the airflow distribution and to compute heat and mass transfer processes along streamlines. The improved simulation scheme predicts the general pattern of moisture content. Under non-parallel airflow conditions, the model provides a better estimation of moisture content than it does of grain temperature. Accurate prediction of airflow distribution was needed to simulate the grain drying process accurately. More work is required to simulate three dimensional flow and drying with concurrent grain shrinkage...|$|R
40|$|Finding ways to {{conserve}} energy {{and reduce costs}} associated with growing crops {{continues to be a}} critical challenge for Ohio agriculture. Significant energy inputs must be supplied by the farmer to grow a crop. For example, the production of an average field of corn can require an estimated 8 million Btu of purchased energy per acre. An estimated 3 million of the fuel and electrical energy use may be required for conventional grain drying. According to survey results reported in 1996, nearly 80 percent of the shelled corn harvested in Ohio was dried on the farm. Twenty percent was dried commercially. Although natural air drying was only used by approximately 8 percent of the farmers who dried corn, it shows promise for both reduced energy input and improved grain quality when properly applied and managed. Defining Natural Air Drying Natural air drying is an <b>in-bin</b> <b>drying</b> system with the following typical characteristics: • Drying process is slow, generally requiring 4 to 8 weeks. • Initial moisture content is normally limited to 22 to 24 %. • Drying results from forcing unheated air through grain at airflow rates of 1 to 2 cfm/bu. • Drying and storage occur in the same bin, minimizing grain handling. • Bin is equipped with a full perforated floor, one or more high-capacity fans, a grain distributor, and stairs (se...|$|E

After drying the grains were stored in bulk in their own silos, where they were drying out. Subsequently, at intervals of 3 months were carried out following physical chemical analysis: 1000 grain weight, volumetric weight, moisture, crude protein, ether extract, ash and carbohydrates. The drying of the grains was conducted with air flow of 2. 52 m 3. s- 1, the average air temperature during drying with natural air was 17 °C, during drying with air natural heated with LPG was 22 °C. The average air drying naturally was 48 hours, while for drying with warm air naturally with LPG was 34 hours. Grains of corn were harvested with moisture content of 31. 88 % and then dried with natural air to reach 15. 70 % moisture and air heated with natural LPG up 13. 39 % moisture. Based on the results we can conclude that: 1. The drying with natural air heated with LPG was faster than air drying in natural conditions of the study; 2. In conditions of high humidity and low temperature drying with natural air should be performed with care due to the equilibrium moisture content; 3. The two drying methods are feasible in terms of quality, but the losses of crude protein, lipid and carbohydrates were higher during the first six months of storage in dry grains with natural air; 4. The natural air drying can be an excellent alternative and low cost to small farmers to dry grain.
