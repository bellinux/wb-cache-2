5|$|The giant ground sloth Megatherium is {{from the}} Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs in South America, where Charles Darwin had {{excavated}} some fossils in 1835. The model was built <b>hugging</b> a live tree which subsequently grew and broke the model's arm. The arm was replaced and later the tree died. This model {{used to be in}} the children's zoo which has now been demolished.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic surge (or base surge), a ground <b>hugging</b> radial cloud that develops along with the eruption column. Base surges are caused by the gravitational collapse of a vaporous eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to the vent, resulting a wedge shape. Associated with these laterally moving rings are dune-shaped depositions of rock left behind by the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common surge indicator.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduate}} school Ahn moved to Seattle {{and worked as}} a psychotherapist. In late 2002 he was dismissed from his job as the supervisor of a group home for at-risk youth in Seattle, after one of the residents accused him of <b>hugging</b> her and holding her hand. In a 2013 retrospective he penned for news portal Rappler, Ahn contended that her allegations were false; made in retaliation for his sanctioning her with loss of privileges for illegal possession of a controlled substance. Thereafter he left the social services and found work in retail management.|$|E
5000|$|The pound <b>hug</b> (also {{referred}} to as a pound shake, hip-hop <b>hug,</b> one-armed <b>hug,</b> dude <b>hug,</b> cootie <b>hug,</b> homie <b>hug,</b> shug, hetero <b>hug,</b> bro-grab, bro <b>hug,</b> brah <b>hug,</b> thug <b>hug,</b> man-hug, or a daps) is a stylized greeting, exclusively performed between two people, that consists of a combination of a handshake and one-armed <b>hug.</b> Unlike the traditional <b>hug,</b> which symbolically and effectively removes interpersonal barriers and unites the two persons embracing, the pound hug—performed by keeping the right hand locked in handshake while the left arm wraps around the other's shoulder—interposes the obstacle of the two right arms to the joining of the two bodies. This type of <b>hug</b> has been frequently used in urban cities and hip hop culture since the late 80s. An example of the pound <b>hug</b> aka bro <b>hug</b> {{can be seen in the}} Tupac Video [...] "I get around" [...] in 1993.|$|R
40|$|In human {{face-to-face}} communication, embodied sharing {{using the}} synchrony of embodied rhythms is promoted by embodied interactions. In particular, embodied interactions with direct contact {{are considered to}} synchronize embodied rhythms effectively. <b>Hug</b> behavior {{is one of the}} types of embodied interactions that involve direct contact. In <b>hug</b> behaviors, humans whole-body contact with each other. In the case of interaction between a human and a robot, the robot synchronizes embodied rhythms effectively using <b>hug</b> behaviors. Thus, a behavior model that can generate a <b>hug</b> behavior with humans is required for robots. Therefore, in this paper, we analyzed <b>hug</b> behaviors between humans and proposed a <b>hug</b> behavior generation model for a <b>hug</b> robot system based in the results of the analysis. This model generates a <b>hug</b> behavior in response to human behavior when a human requests a <b>hug</b> from the robot. Next, we developed a <b>hug</b> robot system that uses the proposed <b>hug</b> behavior generation model. Using the robot system, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed <b>hug</b> behavior generation model by means of a sensory evaluation...|$|R
50|$|The {{official}} mascot of the 2010 ASEAN University Games is a hill tribe youth named Nong <b>Hug.</b> The name <b>Hug</b> {{was chosen}} for the mascot, because <b>Hug</b> means Love in Northern Thai language {{which is also the}} beginning of unity and harmony. In English, the word <b>Hug</b> defines as to embrace or hold one's arms to show the love shared and to <b>hug</b> each other. Nong is the Thai word for young man, or little brother. The combination of love and <b>hug</b> as shown in the red cloth wrapped around Nong <b>Hug’s</b> waist represents the existence of love when being <b>hug</b> for not just people of the host country Thailand but also participating countries of the games from Southeast Asia.|$|R
5|$|By the 1930s, necklines plunged at the back, sleeves {{disappeared}} and sides were cut away and tightened. With {{the development of}} new clothing materials, particularly latex and nylon, through the 1930s swimsuits gradually began <b>hugging</b> the body, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning. Women's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of midriff exposure. Coco Chanel made suntans fashionable, and in 1932 French designer Madeleine Vionnet offered an exposed midriff in an evening gown. They were seen a year later in Gold Diggers of 1933. The Busby Berkeley film Footlight Parade of 1932 showcases aquachoreography that featured bikinis. Dorothy Lamour's The Hurricane (1937) also showed two-piece bathing suits.|$|E
5|$|De Grasse {{ordered his}} fleet {{to prepare for}} action, and {{on the morning of}} April29 sailed for Fort Royal with the convoy ships <b>hugging</b> the coast and the armed ships in battle line. Hood's fleet was seen bearing toward them around 08:00 but deGrasse held the weather gauge. At about 09:20, Hood was joined by Prince William, a 64-gun ship that had been at St. Lucia. The two fleets {{continued}} to push for advantageous positions. Hood's leeward position prevented deGrasse from bringing the convoy to the harbour, but the four previously blockaded French ships were able to sail out and strengthen deGrasse's position. Gibraltar, as Drake's flagship, led the British rear division.|$|E
5|$|Oviri {{has long}} blonde or grey hair {{reaching}} to her knees. Her head and eyes are disproportionately large, she has adolescent breasts, while the aperture {{at the back}} of her head resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a wolf cub to her hip, a symbol of her indifference and wild power. It is not clear whether Oviri is smothering or <b>hugging</b> the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eugène Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.|$|E

5|$|The {{mating system}} of bears has {{variously}} {{been described as}} a form of polygyny, promiscuity and serial monogamy. During the breeding season, males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become more tolerant of males. A male bear may visit a female continuously {{over a period of several}} days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. During this time period, males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate. Courtship may be brief, although in some Asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, <b>hugging,</b> mock fighting and vocalising. Ovulation is induced by mating, which can last up to 30 minutes depending on the species.|$|E

5|$|A judge banned all filming {{but this}} ruling was {{overturned}} by an injunction. Although officials were angry, the residents were not and Jackson {{was surrounded by}} crowds of enthusiastic onlookers during filming. One woman managed to push through security to hug Jackson who continued dancing while <b>hugging</b> her. Another woman appeared and hugged him from behind. He then {{fell to the ground}} as police pulled the two women off him and escorted them away. After the director helped Jackson get up off the street, he continued to sing and dance. This incident made it into the music video. 1,500 policemen and 50 residents acting as security guards effectively sealed off the Dona Marta favela. Some residents and officials found it offensive that Jackson's production team had negotiated with drug dealers in order to gain permission to film in one of the city's shantytowns.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance moved northward, crossing Guatemala {{from the eastern}} Pacific ocean into the northwest Caribbean Sea between September 20 and September 21. It became a tropical cyclone soon after emerging into the Caribbean, and moved across the Yucatán Peninsula as a tropical depression before becoming a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico on September 22 and a hurricane on September 23. It turned sharply east-northeast across the Mouth of the Mississippi river on September 24 as a minor hurricane. The storm continued east-northeast and made landfall in Florida east of Pensacola. The system evolved into an extratropical cyclone soon after passing out of the Sunshine State and continued moving east to northeast <b>hugging</b> the Atlantic Seaboard to near the Virginia Capes before moving slowly through the shipping lanes between Canada and Bermuda, blocked by a high pressure system in southeast Canada.|$|E

Later, at the bar, Peter, Quagmire and Joe discuss the matter, asking if the police can solve the situation. Joe then suggests that the group have an intervention with Brenda, where Quagmire confesses that the sister he knew growing up no longer exists, and he wants her back.

Stevens says that if she had taken less time to dress, she would have arrived at his room sooner and could have been with him while he died. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) then talks to Stevens, picking her up and <b>hugging</b> her. Afterward, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), who {{did not know how to}} handle Burke's situation, goes to his room and puts her hand on his to show him her support. As the episode ends, Stevens confesses to Webber that she was the one responsible for the LVAD wire cut, and claiming she cannot be a surgeon, quits the program.

50|$|A <b>hug,</b> {{sometimes}} {{in association with}} a kiss, {{is a form of}} nonverbal communication. Depending on culture, context and relationship, a <b>hug</b> can indicate familiarity, love, affection, friendship, brotherhood or sympathy. A <b>hug</b> can indicate support, comfort, and consolation, particularly where words are insufficient. A <b>hug</b> usually demonstrates affection and emotional warmth, sometimes arising from joy or happiness when reunited with someone or seeing someone absent after a long time. A non-reciprocal <b>hug</b> may demonstrate a relational problem. A <b>hug</b> can range from a brief one second squeeze, with the arms not fully around the friend to an extended holding. The length of a <b>hug</b> in any situation is socially and culturally determined. In the case of lovers, and occasionally others, the hips may also be pressed together.|$|R

Despite this, Michaels was low-blowed after <b>hugging</b> with Chris Jericho. On the final episode of Raw of 2003, Michaels would defeat Triple H after a Sweet Chin Music for the World Heavyweight title in his hometown of San Antonio, Texas with Eric Bischoff as the special guest referee (Earl Hebner originally refereed the match, only to be knocked out by Triple H {{in the middle of the}} match). However, Bischoff reversed the decision due to both men's shoulders being on the mat. Angered by this, Michaels attacked Ric Flair and Bischoff. Because of Michaels putting his hands on Bischoff, Bischoff then fired him. However, Michaels would be rehired by Steve Austin.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift, barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down beside her and two begin to whisper and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and hugs her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and <b>hugging</b> her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E
