The first systematic observations of ELF electromagnetic fields at the Jagiellonian University were undertaken in 1994. At the beginning the measurements were carried out sporadically, during expeditions to sparsely populated areas of the Bieszczady Mountains in the southeast of Poland.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{analysis}} of background seismic noise variations in the proximity of river channels has revealed as a useful tool to monitor river flow, even for modest discharges. We will focus here {{in the application of}} this methodology to study the snowmelt cycle in an Pyrenean valley during the last 5 years, using data from the seismic <b>geophysical</b> <b>station</b> located inside the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (Central Pyrenees). Diaz et al. (2014) first identified in the seismic data the signature of river flow increases associated to snowmelt episodes in the catchment area of the Aragon River, based on the marked correlation between the seismic energy variations in the 2 - 8 Hz frequency band and the estimated variations in water resources from snowfall. The analysis of seismic data during the snowmelt periods allows to identify a clear 24 h cycle, with energy increasing from about 14 : 00 GMT, remaining at a relatively high level for 12 hours and then smoothly vanishing. The spectrogram reveals richer information, as clear variations in the frequency content can be detected during the time intervals in which the amplitude of the seismic signal remains constant. The data available so far allow to compare the evolution of snowmelt in five seasons with very different hydrological behavior. The 2011 and 2012 seasons have been dry, with snow volumes 30 - 50 % beneath the average values, while the 2013, 2014 and in particular the 2015 seasons have been largely above the mean. Those variations are reflected in the seismic data, which allow to monitor the time occurrence of the main snowmelt stages for each season and to estimate the intensity of the different snowmelt episodes. Therefore, seismic data can be useful for long term monitoring of snowmelt in Alpine-style mountains. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-five shallow, distant {{earthquakes}} {{located in}} the Pacific and recorded at the Ocean Bottom <b>Geophysical</b> <b>station</b> OBS III by a long-period vertical seis-mograph and a long-period crystal hydrophone were selected for analysis of the dispersion of Rayleigh waves. The sensors {{are part of the}} Lamont Geological Observatory's instrument package implanted in May 1966 approximately 200 km west of San Francisco at a water depth of 3. 9 km. The location of the station and that of the epicenters, all in the ocean, give us {{for the first time the}} opportunity of studying purely oceanic paths. The group velocity dispersion curves in the period range 12 - 40 sec show minor regional differences in the oceanic crustal structure. For comparison, dispersion curves were obtained for 24 of these earthquakes from the seismograms recorded at the Berkeley seismograph station, BKS. Most of the pairs of dispersion curves show no significant differences due to crossing the continental margin. However, the group velocities of Rayleigh waves from southern Alaska and Easter Island are higher at OBS III than at Berkeley by as much as 0. 1 km/sec. Realizing that theoretical models based exclusively on surface-wave data are not unique, and taking Dorman's oceanic model 8099 as our starting point, we were able to fit our experimental dispersion curves using models characterized by a low-velocity zone starting at a depth of about 60 km. According to this type of soludon the crust is thicker along the paths from south Alaska and Easter Island, parallel to the coast, than along the other paths examined. The pressure-to-displacement ratio (P/D) is not very sensitive to changes in the models for periods greater than 12 sec.

The Netlander mission offers a unique opportunity to explore the interior of Mars, its subsurface, its atmosphere, and its distant environment from four landing sites that will be selected to offer a variety of different geophysical conditions. We have thus proposed to fly on these four landers a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to explore the geological characteristics of the subsurface and search for water reservoirs down to a depth which may be sufficient to allow a possible detection of liquid water. We provide in this paper a short description of this radar which is based on a new concept to allow a 3 -D imaging of the subsurface by determining the range and direction of the underground reflectors. In order to access to deep layers, it will operate at a low frequency of 2 MHz. Some results obtained by a numerical modeling of the radar operation in an electromagnetic model of the Martian subsurface are presented in order to illustrate the main capabilities of the radar. In the last section, preliminary results from an initial field test are reported. In addition to its primary goal as a ground-penetrating radar, the GPR will also be operated on Mars as an ionospheric sounder and, in a passive mode, as a HF receiver to measure the radio-electric background...|$|R
