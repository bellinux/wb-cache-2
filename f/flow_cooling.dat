This salt had probably prevented vegetation. The water, however, never could have entered from the sea, had not the lava which originally made the outlet left a sort of channel that was lower than the surface of the outer rocks.

40|$|I study non-radiative cooling of X-ray {{emitting}} gas via {{heat conduction}} along magnetic field lines inside magnetic flux loops in <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> clusters of galaxies.

This non-radiative cooling joins two other proposed non-radiative cooling processes, which can be more efficient. These are mixing of cold and hot gas, and heat conduction initiated by magnetic fields reconnection between hot and cold gas. These processes when incorporated into the moderate <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> model lead to a general <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> model with the following ingredients. (1) <b>Cooling</b> <b>flow</b> does occur, but with a mass cooling rate ∼ 10 times lower than in old (∼ 10 years ago) versions of the <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> model. Namely, heating occurs such that the effective age of the <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> is much below the cluster age, but the heating can’t prevent cooling altogether.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> in galaxy {{clusters}} on the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SZ) distortion and the possible cosmological implications. The SZ effect, along with X-ray observations of clusters, is {{used to determine the}} Hubble constant, H◦. Blank sky surveys of SZ effect are being planned to constrain the geometry of the universe through cluster counts. It is also known that a significant fraction of clusters has <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> in them, which changes the pressure profile of intracluster gas. Since the SZ decrement depends essentially on the pressure profile, it is important to study possible changes in the determination of cosmological parameters {{in the presence of a}} <b>cooling</b> <b>flow.</b> We build several representative models of <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> and compare the results with the corresponding case of gas in hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that <b>cooling</b> <b>flows</b> can lead to an overestimation of the Hubble constant.

The mass flux due to the <b>cooling</b> <b>flow</b> increases with time, as the Compton cooled region expands.

Radiation may {{play an important role}} in the wall heating and <b>flow</b> <b>cooling</b> of scramjets. However, very few studies have focused on such. The present analysis is based on three-dimensional turbulent reacting flow simulations of the HyShot II hydrogen fueled scramjet engine running at flight conditions of Mach 7. 4.
