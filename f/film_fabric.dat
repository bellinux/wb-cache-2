5000|$|Many nitrate {{films have}} been {{transferred}} in recent decades to safety stock, and original nitrate prints are generally stored separately to prevent a nitrate fire from destroying other non-nitrate films; the gas they give off also affects the emulsion of safety film. Usually nitrate collections are even split up into several different fireproof rooms to minimize damage to an entire collection should a fire occur in one part. It is normal for a theater today to pass rigorous safety standards and precautions before being certified to run nitrate films; this includes a fireproof projection booth, fire chambers surrounding the feed and take-up reels, and several fire extinguishers built into the projector and aimed at the projector's film gate in case a trigger piece of <b>film</b> <b>fabric</b> ignites. Nitrate film is classified as [...] "dangerous goods", which requires licenses for storage and transportation.|$|E

40|$|Type of Technology: Capture device- {{collects}} and vents pollutants to an abatement device {{such as an}} incinerator. Applicable Pollutants: Organic hazardous {{air pollutants}} (HAP) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Achievable Emission Limits/Reductions: PTEs have a capture efficiency of 100 % (EPA, 2002). Emissions reductions are dependant on the downstream pollution control device. Applicable Source Type: Point or fugitive Typical Industrial Applications: Any process or operation where total emissions capture is required. They are commonly used in flexographic printing, rotogravure printing, coating (paper, <b>film,</b> <b>fabric,</b> and metal), laminating, screen printing, can coating, and plastic card coating. Emission Stream Characteristics: a. Air Flow: PTEs draw clean air into the enclosure for venting of waste gas. The air flow through a PTE must provide adequate capture and transport of the waste gas. The direction of air flow through all natural draft openings (NDOs) must be into the enclosure. The average facial velocity of air though all NDOs shall be at least 3, 600 m/hr (200 ft/min) (EPA, 1997).

50|$|Adhesion {{barriers}} are physical <b>films,</b> <b>fabrics,</b> gels or other {{materials that are}} applied between layers of tissues {{at the end of}} a surgery before the incision site is closed. While in place, the adhesion barrier acts as a physical barrier to separate traumatized tissue surfaces so that they do not adhere to one another while the tissue surfaces heal. Once the tissue surfaces heal, which is usually between 3 and 7 days, the barrier dissolves and is absorbed by the body.|$|R

40|$|Continuous {{ultrasonic}} welding of plastic <b>films,</b> <b>fabrics,</b> and even thermoplastic composite prepreg tape {{is a common}} industrial practice. However, continuous {{ultrasonic welding}} of stiff thermoplastic composite plates is challenging due to squeeze flow of resin at the welding interface, and significant local deformation of the welding stack, that are generally needed to achieve strong welds. This paper presents a novel approach to continuous ultrasonic welding of thermoplastic composite plates based on zero-flow welding. The proposed technique can create strong welds before any squeeze flow {{takes place at the}} interface. It is enabled by the use of very thin flat energy directors, owing to simultaneous melting of both energy director and adherends’ matrix. The results prove the feasibility and indicate the potential for high-strength welds between thermoplastic composite plates at very high speed. Structural Integrity & Composite...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) {{has good}} {{ultraviolet}} (UV) -blocking power {{and is very}} attractive in practical ap-plications because of such advantages as nontoxicity, chem-ical stability at high temperature, and permanent stability under UV exposure, for example.
