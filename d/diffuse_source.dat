5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a <b>diffuse</b> <b>source</b> set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{contributors}} to air, soil and water pollution is animal waste. According to a 2005 report by the USDA, more than 335 million tons of [...] "dry matter" [...] waste (the waste after water is removed) is produced annually on farms in the United States. [...] Animal feeding operations produce about 100 times more manure than the amount of human sewage sludge processed in US municipal waste water plants each year. <b>Diffuse</b> <b>source</b> pollution from agricultural fertilizers {{is more difficult to}} trace, monitor and control. High nitrate concentrations are found in groundwater and may reach 50mg/litre (the EU Directive limit). In ditches and river courses, nutrient pollution from fertilizers causes eutrophication. This is worse in winter, after autumn ploughing has released a surge of nitrates; winter rainfall is heavier increasing runoff and leaching, and there is lower plant uptake. EPA suggests that one dairy farm with 2,500 cows produces as much waste as a city with around 411,000 residents. The National Research Council has identified odors as the most significant animal emission problem at the local level. Different animal systems have adopted several waste management procedures to deal with the large amount of waste produced annually.|$|E

40|$|In the UK and Europe {{mine water}} {{management}} has, to date, focused {{almost exclusively on}} addressing point sources of pollution. However, {{with the introduction of}} the EU Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC), {{there is a need to}} address mine water pollution from a catchment management perspective. For this reason it is necessary to investigate <b>diffuse</b> <b>sources</b> of mining pollution. This paper relates the outcomes of a study of the River Gaunless catchment in County Durham, UK. These studies have shown that up to 45 % of the iron load to the River Gaunless may be due to <b>diffuse</b> <b>sources</b> during dry weather conditions, and over 95 % of the iron in the river may be attributable to <b>diffuse</b> <b>sources</b> during wet weather conditions. Identification and quantification of the most important <b>diffuse</b> <b>sources</b> (e. g. surface runoff from spoil, re-suspension of ochre from streambeds) is ongoing.

50|$|MPEG Surround coding uses our {{capacity}} to perceive sound in the 3D and captures that perception in a compact set of parameters. Spatial perception is primarily attributed to three parameters, or cues, describing how humans localize sound in the horizontal plane: Interaural level difference (ILD), Interaural time difference (ITD) and Interaural coherence (IC). This three concepts are illustrated in next image. Direct, or first-arrival, waveforms from the source hit the left ear at time, while direct sound received by the right ear is diffracted around the head, with time delay and level attenuation, associated. These two effects result in ITD and ILD {{are associated with the}} main source. At last, in a reverberant environment, reflected sound from the source, or sound from <b>diffuse</b> <b>source,</b> or uncorrelated sound can hit both ears, all of them are related with IC.|$|E
50|$|Perception of {{direction}} is greatly {{affected by the}} relative time that a sound arrives at each ear and any difference in the amplitude of a sound at each ear. It is possible to create a sound source having an output characteristic which is rapidly varying with direction and frequency of signal. These kinds of sources create sound fields which are rapidly variable around the listeners room. These are {{often referred to as}} diffuse sources, this is because their output resembles a diffuse sound field — a sound field where soundwaves are traveling in all directions with equal probability. In a diffuse field the sound at each of a listeners' ears is so completely different that it is impossible for the brain to work out where the sound has come from. A <b>diffuse</b> <b>source</b> located in front of the listener will be hard to localize and can be used to carry the surround signals.|$|E

As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen.

The novelty of the MSME method is to use wavelet decomposition and multiresolution support to control noise amplification in the different scales. And our work {{is focused on the}} application and modification of this method to restore diffuse sources detected by HXMT scanning observation. And an improved method, ensemble multiscale maximum entropy (EMSME) algorithm, is proposed to alleviate the problem of mode mixing exiting in MSME.

To achieve its aims the directive requires the realisation of cost-efficient programmes of measures. In this context, also measures for reducing phosphate inputs have to be taken, which demands models as quantification tools for the status quo analysis as well as for scenario analyses. An area-differentiated model approach (MEPhos) for the systematic quantification of P-inputs from point and <b>diffuse</b> <b>sources</b> via eight different pathways is presented.

40|$|Recently, a novel <b>diffuse</b> <b>source</b> (DS) {{upscaling}} {{method has}} been successfully applied for the upscaling of US tight gas reservoir model. However, this approach does not work {{very well in the}} conventional SPE 10 waterflood reservoir model. Therefore, in this work, the goal is to figure out why this approach does not work in another model and how to improve this DS upscaling algorithm. Detailed analysis shows that there are three issues that need to be resolved for a more robust algorithm. The first issue is about the specification of the <b>diffuse</b> <b>source</b> time that is needed to define the transient state <b>diffuse</b> <b>source</b> in the fine cell. In the previous work, the time selection rule is not clearly stated. Too small or too large time values can lead to an overestimated or underestimated upscaling result. In this study, I find that the <b>diffuse</b> <b>source</b> time can be correlated with the fine cell diffusive time of flight (DTOF). By means of a series of sensitivity test, I get the conclusion that we can use the pore volume weighted average of the DTOF square to determine the <b>diffuse</b> <b>source</b> time. The second issue is related to the calculation of the effective transmissibility. In the case of upscaling the homogenous model, the previous proposed effective transmissibility calculation method gives us a wrong result. In this study, by studying the internal pressure profile in the coarse cells, I propose to use the fine cell pressures immediately adjacent to the coarse cell interface to determine an effective face permeability and apply the effective permeability to the calculation of steady state transmissibility in the simulator. The effective transmissibility obtained from this method is correct when the model is homogenous. The third issue {{has to do with the}} no flow boundary condition used in the local upscaling. In upscaling, we often encounter such problem that the no flow boundary condition is a bad approximation and to improve the accuracy of the result, we need to consider the existence of boundary effect. In this study, I generalize the DS upscaling algorithm by adding a buffering region around the upscaling coarse cells to reduce the impact of unrealistic boundary condition on the inter-cell effective transmissibility calculation. The buffering region is determined according to the fine cell DTOF in the target coarse cells and by using the exponential function in the <b>diffuse</b> <b>source</b> term, I propose a cut-off criterion to exclude the cells that are not necessary for upscaling. Based on all the analysis above, I applied an improved upscaling algorithm for the upscaling of the SPE 10 model. It turns out that the simulation results from the new upscaled model have a good match with the fine scale results, which gives us the confidence on this improved algorithm...|$|E

The four catchments represent diverse climate, hydrology, and nutrient loads from <b>diffuse</b> and point <b>sources</b> in Norway, the UK, Italy, and the Czech Republic.

A comparison of retention values with the size of nutrient sources showed that the modelled nutrient export from <b>diffuse</b> <b>sources</b> was directly proportional to retention estimates, hence implying that the uncertainty in quantification of <b>diffuse</b> catchment <b>sources</b> of nutrients was also related to the uncertainty in nutrient retention determination.
