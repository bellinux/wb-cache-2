50|$|<b>Flywheel</b> {{energy storage}} (FES) works by {{accelerating}} a rotor (<b>flywheel)</b> {{to a very}} high speed, holding energy as rotational energy. When energy is extracted, the <b>flywheel's</b> rotational speed declines {{as a consequence of}} conservation of energy; adding energy correspondingly results in an increase in the speed of the <b>flywheel.</b>|$|R
25|$|The 2600s {{shared the}} engines and {{transmission}} of their GNR(I) predecessors, having two , 9.6-litre, six-cylinder, four-stroke engines driving the inner axles {{of the two}} bogies via fluid <b>flywheels</b> and Self-Changing Gears five-speed preselector gearboxes, with cardan shafts driving forward/reverse gearboxes {{on the ends of}} the axles. Multiple working was via 24-core jumper cables. The cars were fitted with two parallel vacuum brake systems—a conventional system and a second high-vacuum, quick-release system, based on reservoirs in which a vacuum was continually maintained, for use on services with frequent stops. Steam heating was originally fitted; even-numbered cars had a boiler in the guard's compartment, capable of supplying steam for up to four cars. Cars used on suburban services were subsequently fitted with a bus-type heating system that utilised the engines' cooling water.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical inertia is {{the basis}} of this storage method. When the {{electric}} power flows into the device, an electric motor accelerates a heavy rotating disc. The motor acts as a generator when the flow of power is reversed, slowing down the disc and producing electricity. Electricity is stored as the kinetic energy of the disc. Friction must be kept to a minimum to prolong the storage time. This is often achieved by placing the flywheel in a vacuum and using magnetic bearings, tending to make the method expensive. Greater flywheel speeds allow greater storage capacity but require strong materials such as steel or composite materials to resist the centrifugal forces. The ranges of power and energy storage technology that make this method economic, however, tends to make <b>flywheels</b> unsuitable for general power system application; they are probably best suited to load-leveling applications on railway power systems and for improving power quality in renewable energy systems such as the 20MW system in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Zvezda uses {{gyroscopes}} and thrusters to turn itself around. Gyroscopes do {{not require}} propellant, rather they use electricity to 'store' momentum in <b>flywheels</b> by turning {{in the opposite direction}} to the station's movement. The USOS has its own computer controlled gyroscopes to handle the extra mass of that section. When gyroscopes 'saturate', thrusters are used to cancel out the stored momentum. During Expedition 10, an incorrect command was sent to the station's computer, using about 14 kilograms of propellant before the fault was noticed and fixed. When attitude control computers in the ROS and USOS fail to communicate properly, it can result in a rare 'force fight' where the ROS GNC computer must ignore the USOS counterpart, which has no thrusters. When an ATV, NASA Shuttle, or Soyuz is docked to the station, it {{can also be used to}} maintain station attitude such as for troubleshooting. Shuttle control was used exclusively during installation of the S3/S4 truss, which provides electrical power and data interfaces for the station's electronics.|$|E
5000|$|A {{friction}} motor is {{a simple}} mechanism to propel toy cars, trucks, trains, action figures and similar toys. The motor consists of a large <b>flywheel</b> which {{is connected to the}} drive wheels of the toy via a very low gear ratio, so that the <b>flywheel</b> revolves faster. The <b>flywheel's</b> axis is perpendicular to the direction in which the toy faces and moves. When the toy is pushed forward, the drive wheels engage the <b>flywheel.</b> Pushing the vehicle forward repeatedly spins this <b>flywheel</b> up to speed. When let go, the <b>flywheel</b> drives the vehicle forward. The <b>flywheel</b> stores the kinetic energy of the initial acceleration and propels the toy after it is released.|$|R

25|$|Proper {{tracking}} {{of the blade}} is crucial to accurate cutting and considerably reduces blade breakage. The first step to ensuring good tracking is to check that the two bandwheels or <b>flywheels</b> are co-planar. This {{can be done by}} placing a straightedge across the front of the wheels and adjusting until each wheel touches. Rotate the wheels with the blade in position and properly tensioned and check that the tracking is correct. Now install the blade guide rollers and leave a gap of about 1 mm between the back of the blade and the guide flange. The teeth of blades that have become narrow through repeated sharpening will foul the front edge of the guide rollers due to their kerf set and force the blade out of alignment. This can be remedied by cutting of a small step on the rollers' front edges to accommodate the protruding teeth. Ideally the rollers should be crowned, (see belt_and_pulley_systems) a configuration that assists in the proper {{tracking of}} bands and belts, at the same time allowing clearance for the set of the teeth.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} Flywheel, Shyster, and <b>Flywheels</b> scripts reused plots from Marx Brothers films. The plot of Episode 17 was {{suggested}} by the stolen painting plot in Animal Crackers, {{though it was a}} [...] "Beauregard" [...] in the film, not a Rembrandt. The 23rd episode also reused scenes from Animal Crackers, including the stolen diamond plot and Groucho's lines regarding the need for a seven-cent nickel. Monkey Business influenced two skits in Episode 25, and The Cocoanuts gave Episode 19 its plot. Episode 26, The Ocean Cruise, lifted some scenes virtually unchanged from the Marx Brothers' film Animal Crackers. Vaudeville acts of the 1920s typically based their stage routines on the assumption that all audiences were heterosexual; some episodes of Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel accordingly included relatively low-key homosexual jokes taken from the Marx Brothers' stage act.|$|E

[...] Energy provided in pushing the plunger in will be returned when the plunger moves in the opposite direction, hence the device stores energy rather than dissipates it just like a block of mass.

500|$|A unique launch system propels riders up the [...] hill. The {{system was}} {{developed}} by Universal Creative and MTS Systems Corporation. A prototype launch system was designed by January 1995. The prototype consisted {{of a series of}} boxcars welded together to form a launch tunnel. A track-mounted dune buggy was then propelled inside the tunnel {{through the use of a}} weight drop launch mechanism. The designers then experimented with different rates of acceleration, each emitting between one and five times the force of gravity. The final system which was implemented on The Incredible Hulk sees trains launch from 0 to [...] in 2 seconds. Riders travel at an angle of 30 degrees through a [...] tunnel, pulling 1G. To power this launch the designers investigated a variety of systems ranging from hydraulic, pneumatic, cable, steam catapult, and conveyor belt. In the end a drive tire system was selected, where 230 electrical motors power a set of tires that pinch the train's underside to provide propulsion. As this system required eight megawatts of power to launch a train, the park built several customized motor generator sets with large <b>flywheels.</b> Without these stored energy units, they would have had to build a whole substation and risk browning-out the local energy grid with every launch.
