40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a {{mathematical}} model that answers a classical question concerning how much force, which is generally called static friction force, will it require to initiate the motion of a soft solid block such as <b>gel,</b> <b>rubber</b> or elastomer on a hard surface for instance glass surface. The model uses population balance of the bonds between the polymer chains of the soft solid and the hard surface to estimate rate and aging time dependent static friction. The model predicts that under certain range of the pulling velocity, the friction stress {{at the onset of}} sliding (static friction stress) varies as the logarithm of the pulling velocity, as well as the logarithm of the aging time. These predictions are consistent with the experimental observations...|$|E
40|$|Liquid crystal {{elastomers}} {{realize a}} fascinating {{new form of}} soft matter that is a composite of a conventional crosslinked polymer <b>gel</b> (<b>rubber)</b> and a liquid crystal. These solid liquid crystal amalgams, quite similarly to their (conventional, fluid) liquid crystal counterparts, can spontaneously partially break translational and/or orientational symmetries, accompanied by novel soft Goldstone modes. As a consequence, these materials can exhibit unconventional elasticity characterized by symmetry-enforced vanishing of some elastic moduli. Thus, a proper description of such solids requires an essential modification of the classical elasticity theory. In this work, we develop a rotationally invariant, nonlinear theory of elasticity for the nematic phase of ideal liquid crystal elastomers. We show that it is characterized by soft modes, corresponding {{to a combination of}} long wavelength shear deformations of the solid network and rotations of the nematic director field. We study thermal fluctuations of these soft modes in the presence of network heterogeneities and show that they lead to a large variety of anomalous elastic properties, such as singular length-scale dependent shear elastic moduli, a divergent elastic constant for splay distortion of the nematic director, long-scale incompressibility, universal Poisson ratios and a nonlinear stress-strain relation fo arbitrary small strains. These long-scale elastic properties are universal, controlled by a nontrivial zero-temperature fixed point and constitute a qualitative breakdown of the classical elasticity theory in nematic elastomers. Thus, nematic elastomers realize a stable "critical phase", characterized by universal power-law correlations, akin to a critical point of a continuous phase transition, but extending over an entire phase.

40|$|Blast injury {{has been}} a threat on the battle field, a threat to civilians from acts of terrorism, and a threat to {{soldiers}} in training. When the body is exposed to blast explosion, the body surface and internal organs such as brain, liver, kidney and lung, are rapidly distorted and ruptured due to the envelopment of body in the over pressurized wave Blast can cause {{a wide range of}} injuries. The mechanism of injuries can be correlated with the mechanical response of the body tissues and to the characteristic of blast pressure itself. Valid quantitative measurements of the tissues responses are of interest in biomedical study of blast injury. ^ Soft biological tissues such as brain, liver and kidney exhibit complex mechanical behavior. These materials are characterized by low strength and stiffness, low wave speed, low mechanical impedance, large strain, rate sensitivity and volumetric incompressibility. The need to accurately measure the high rate deformation of such materials has been tremendous challenges for scientist and engineers. ^ This thesis presents an experimental technique capable of measuring the family of stress-strain curves as a function of strain rates which represents the incidence of blast injury. In this technique, split Hopkinson pressure bar has been employed where an annulus biological tissue specimen were loaded in the axial direction to measure the compressive stress-strain behavior of tissues. ^ Modifications made to the conventional SHPB for soft material testing in recent decades have been adopted to characterize the brain, liver and kidney tissues at high strain rates. This method is capable to predict the dynamic behavior of other soft materials such as <b>gel,</b> <b>rubber</b> and polymeric foam. Quasistatic and intermediate compression experiments have been performed on brain, liver and kidney tissues. The quasi-static and intermediate axial load was applied by a hydraulic driven Material Test System (MTS). Under quasi-static, intermediate and dynamic loading conditions, the experimental results for brain, liver and kidney tissues showed that the stress-strain responses of these tissues are rate sensitive. ^ The biomechanical properties of living tissues depend not only on the inherent variability in the tissue properties due to gender, species and breeding but also region and orientation of the tested tissue specimen. A parametric study has been conducted on brain tissue to observe the effect of these factors on tissue properties. This study demonstrated that biomechanical properties of brain tissues are not significantly depends on brain region and orientation. The effects of species, gender and breeding has no contribution to the mechanical properties of brain tissues. ^ Tissue mimic gels are commonly used in biomedical applications such as tissue regeneration, tissue scaffolding and tissue repair due to their biocompatibility. Different concentration of gel materials have been fabricated and tested under identical dynamic loading condition to find the candidate gel materials that can response to dynamic loading in a similar as the brain tissues. It was found that Agarose gels with concentration of 0. 6 %- 0. 4 % range are closed to that of brain tissues in terms of mechanical and rheological properties. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{electric}} field strength on the electromechanical properties of crosslinked natural rubber {{for use in}} actuator applications was investigated. The physical and electrical properties of crosslinked natural rubber with various crosslinking ratios were measured under an applied external electric field.

All experiments were conducted in the linear viscoelastic regime, in the frequency range of 0. 1 - 100 rad/s and at 1 % strain. In the absence of an applied electric field, the storage modulus increased with deceasing crosslinking ratio because of the greater amount of strands in the <b>rubber</b> <b>gel.</b> When the external electric field was applied, the storage modulus increased because of the electrostatic force between the crosslinking points. At each crosslinking ratio, the storage modulus was higher than the loss modulus because of the solidity of the materials. Thus, the crosslinked natural rubber reported here may represent an inexpensive and highly electroresponsive material with good mechanical properties for artificial muscle applications...|$|R

We find that viscoelastic behavior of this suspension is dramatically affected with increasing volume fraction of montmorillonite platelets. Addition of montmorillonite generally leads to gel formation, which is attributed to interactions of montmorillonite and alginate via H-bonding and attraction between the positive edges of the platelets and the anionic backbone of the biopolymer. A critical concentration for the measured system was observed at 20 wt. % montmorillonite, where a crossover to a gel-like structure was detected. The observed <b>gel</b> has a <b>rubber</b> plateau, which develops further with higher montmorillonite concentration.

40|$|A nematic liquid-crystal gel is a macroscopically {{homogeneous}} elastic medium {{with the}} rotational symmetry of a nematic liquid crystal. In this paper, we develop a general {{approach to the}} study of these gels that incorporates all underlying symmetries. After reviewing traditional elasticity and clarifying the role of broken rotational symmetries in both the reference space of points in the undistorted medium and the target space into which these points are mapped, we explore the unusual properties of nematic gels from a number of perspectives. We show how symmetries of nematic gels formed via spontaneous symmetry breaking from an isotropic gel enforce soft elastic response characterized by the vanishing of a shear modulus and the vanishing of stress up to a critical value of strain along certain directions. We also study the phase transition from isotropic to nematic gels. In addition to being fully consistent with approaches to nematic <b>gels</b> based on <b>rubber</b> elasticity, our description has the important advantages of being independent of a microscopic model, of emphasizing and clarifying the role of broken symmetries in determining elastic response, and of permitting easy incorporation of spatial variations, thermal fluctuations, and gel heterogeneity, thereby allowing a full statistical-mechanical treatment of these novel materials.

Four different system geometries are considered: a rigid cylinder moving parallel to a soft layer coating a rigid substrate; a soft cylinder moving parallel to a rigid substrate; a cylindrical shell moving parallel to a rigid substrate; and finally a cylindrical conforming journal bearing coated with a thin soft layer. In addition, for the particular case of a soft layer coating a rigid substrate we consider both elastic and poroelastic material responses.

Here we present a conceptual framework for the interaction of amorphous aerosol particles with water vapor, outlining characteristic features and differences in comparison to crystalline particles. We used a hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer (H-TDMA) to characterize the hydration and dehydration of crystalline ammonium sulfate, amorphous oxalic acid and amorphous levoglucosan particles (diameter ~ 100 nm, relative humidity 5 – 95 % at 298 K). The experimental data and accompanying Köhler model calculations provide new insights into particle microstructure, surface adsorption, bulk absorption, phase transitions and hygroscopic growth. The results of these and related investigations lead to the following conclusions: (1) Many organic substances, including carboxylic acids, carbohydrates and proteins, tend to form amorphous rather than crystalline phases upon drying of aqueous solution droplets. Depending on viscosity and microstructure, the amorphous phases can be classified as glasses, <b>rubbers,</b> <b>gels</b> or viscous liquids. (2) Amorphous organic substances tend to absorb water vapor and undergo gradual deliquescence and hygroscopic growth at lower relative humidity than their crystalline counterparts. (3) In the course of hydration and dehydration, certain organic substances can form rubber- or gel-like structures (supramolecular networks) and undergo transitions between swollen and collapsed network structures. (4) Organic gels or (semi-) solid amorphous shells (glassy, rubbery, ultra-viscous) with low molecular diffusivity can kinetically limit the uptake and release of water and may influence the hygroscopic growth and activation of aerosol particles as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN). Moreover, (semi-) solid amorphous phases may influence the uptake of gaseous photo-oxidants and the chemical transformation and aging of atmospheric aerosols. (5) The shape and porosity of amorphous and crystalline particles formed upon dehydration of aqueous solution droplets depend on chemical composition and drying conditions. The apparent volume void fractions of particles with highly porous structures can range up to ~ 50 % or more (xerogels, aerogels).
