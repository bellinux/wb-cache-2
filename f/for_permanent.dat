40|$|AbstractLet UR(α, β) {{denote the}} class of all square {{matrices}} with each entry equal {{to one of the}} nonnegative numbers α and β and with row sum vector R. We prove that the maximum value of the permanent of a matrix in the convex hull of UR(α, β) is achieved at a matrix in UR(α, β). One consequence of this result is an extension to matrices with entries between 0 and 1 of the Minc-Brégman upper bound <b>for</b> <b>permanents</b> of (0, 1) matrices in terms of the integral row sums. We obtain other upper bounds <b>for</b> <b>permanents</b> of certain nonnegative matrices and give a nonprobabilistic proof of an inequality of Chang <b>for</b> the <b>permanents</b> of certain doubly stochastic matrices...|$|R

The Office du Niger was founded in 1926 as the main organization facilitating planned, irrigated agricultural projects. Farmers resisted forced resettlement and petitioned <b>for</b> <b>permanent</b> land rights to the irrigated land (which was usually held as property of the Office du Niger). Despite these efforts, a significant cash crop economy did not develop in the French Sudan.|$|E

She received emergency repairs before departing on 24 July <b>for</b> <b>permanent</b> repairs at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in the United States, 829 Squadron flying aboard with its Albacores to provide anti-submarine patrols during the voyage. She arrived on 25 August, and the repairs were completed in early December. After several days of sea trials, she sailed for Britain in company with Illustrious on 12 December. During the night of 15/16 December, Illustrious collided with Formidables stern, but neither ship was seriously damaged. She was repaired at Belfast from 21 December 1941 to 3 February 1942 and embarked the Albacores of 818 and 820 Squadrons and the Grumman Martlet fighters of 888 Squadron.|$|E

The facilities there could only provide emergency repairs, enough {{to allow her to}} reach the bigger dockyard in Sydney. Task Force 57 arrived in San Pedro Bay on 23 April for a more thorough replenishment period and Illustrious transferred aircraft, spares, stores, and newly arrived pilots to the other carriers before sailing for Sydney on 3 May. She arrived on 14 May and departed 10 days later, bound for Rosyth <b>for</b> <b>permanent</b> repairs. 854 Squadron was disembarked while at Sydney, but the carrier kept her two Corsair squadrons until after arriving in the UK on 27 June.|$|E

The Admiralty decided that further attempts to repair her at Malta were pointless and ordered her to Gibraltar <b>for</b> <b>permanent</b> repairs. On 6 April, while on passage to Gibraltar, Havock ran aground near Cape Bon, Tunisia, and her crew was interned by the Vichy French at Laghouat in the Sahara.|$|E
