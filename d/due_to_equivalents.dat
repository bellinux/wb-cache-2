40|$|To {{investigate}} the crack growth behaviour under combined creepfatigue loading, CT 25 mm-specimens of X 10 NiCrAlTi 32 20 (Alloy 800) {{have been tested}} in experiments with cyclic loadings and hold times, with static loadings and short stress relief interrupts, with ramp type loadings and with sequences of separatefatigue and creep crack growth periods.

For the estimation of crack growth under combined loading conditions a linear accumulation of increase in crack length was proved using the crack growth laws of pure creep and fatigue crack growth.

In hold time experiments the crack growth rate is higher than ramp tests of the same period time.

On one hand, OWRT needs two-phase for transmission in each direction, thus the data rate in each phase should be twice of that in DT, which requires more transmit power. On the other hand, OWRT has higher equivalent channel gain, which reduces the required transmit power. In low traffic region, doubling the lower data rate has little impact on the transmit power, and thus OWRT is more energy efficient <b>due</b> <b>to</b> higher <b>equivalent</b> channel gain.|$|R
