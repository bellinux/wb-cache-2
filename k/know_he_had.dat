5|$|In 1980, Hašek {{joined the}} top hockey league in the country, the Czechoslovak Extraliga, with his {{hometown}} team, HC Pardubice. He {{became the youngest}} hockey player in history {{to play at the}} professional level at age 16. He helped to win two league titles in 1987 and 1989. The next year, he was drafted by the Czech army to play for Dukla Jihlava. After making his mark and eventually playing for the Czechoslovakian National team, Hašek entered the NHL draft and was drafted by the Chicago Blackhawks in 1983. At the time, NHL teams were wary of drafting players from behind the Iron Curtain who were often unwilling to play in the NHL or barred from doing so by their countries. Consequently, Hašek was picked in the 10th round (199th overall) and was the seventeenth goalie selected. Hašek did not even <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been drafted until several months later.|$|E
5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E

25|$|On May 3, Carl Crawford set a team {{record and}} tied a modern-day league record with six stolen bases. The last player to steal six bases was Eric Young {{while he was}} a member of the Colorado Rockies on June 30, 1996. It was only the fifth time since 1912 that a player had stolen that many bases, which was also the last year it had {{happened}} in the American League. After the game Crawford stated that he didn't <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> tied a record, or else he would have made an attempt for seven.|$|E
25|$|Whitman {{enlisted in}} the United States Marine Corps one month after his June 1959 {{graduation}} from high school, where he had graduated seventh {{in a class of}} 72 students. He had not told his father beforehand. Whitman told a family friend that the catalyst was an incident a month earlier, in which his father had beaten him and thrown him into the family swimming pool because Whitman had come home drunk. Whitman left home on July 6, having been assigned an 18-month tour of duty with the Marines at Guantanamo Bay. His father still did not <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> enlisted.|$|E

500|$|Media reports {{suggested}} that {{his death was}} caused by heat exhaustion, until, on 31 July 1967 British journalist J. L. Manning of the Daily Mail broke the news about a formal connection between drugs and Simpson's death: [...] "Tommy Simpson rode to his death in the Tour de France so doped {{that he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> reached the limit of his endurance. He died in the saddle, slowly asphyxiated by intense effort in a heatwave after taking methylamphetamine drugs and alcoholic stimulants." ...|$|E
500|$|After Charles's death, Lucinda Dalton {{applied to}} cancel her temple sealing to Charles in 1884: [...] "though I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> many imperfections... now the brethren {{say he is}} unworthy, (though I know not who {{appointed}} them to judge him,) they urge that I stand in a very insecure position, and that for my children's sake, {{as well as my}} own, I ought to marry again." [...] Dalton feared that by remaining sealed to Charles, she would forfeit her claim to her children. Perhaps because Charles was a drinker, her [...] "brethren" [...] considered him unworthy of his sealing. Her sealing cancellation was approved in 1887 and then revoked after her death in 1931.|$|E
500|$|The {{main problem}} with the Act was {{whether or not the}} {{claimant}} had to <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a method of action or not for the standard limitation period to apply. The House of Lords had an opportunity to resolve this in Central Asbestos Co Ltd v Dodd but [...] "failed spectacularly", making a decision so confused that the Court of Appeal in Harper and others v National Coal Board said they could not actually find a ratio decidendi anywhere in the House of Lords' opinion. The Act also suffered from drafting problems - in Central Asbestos Lord Reid described it as having [...] "a strong claim to the distinction of being the worst drafted Act on the statute book". The Act was repealed piecemeal by a series of Acts during the 1970s, and the Limitation Act 1980 finally repealed the last remaining sections.|$|E

500|$|Initial discussions {{took place}} in 2008 between Tom Cruise and Noyce about Cruise playing Edwin A. Salt. These discussions were ongoing {{for more than a}} year between the pair and their representatives. It was finally decided that Cruise was unable to commit to the script, because he feared that the {{character}} was too close to his [...] character Ethan Hunt. Cruise decided to work on [...] Knight and Day instead. The filmmakers tried to differentiate the character from Hunt, but eventually came to accept they were too similar and decided not to change the characteristics of Salt. Noyce said [...] "But, you <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a valid point. It was kind of returning to an offshoot of a character that he’d already played. It’s like playing the brother, or the cousin, of somebody that you played in another movie".|$|E
500|$|Morgan's {{statements}} {{caused a}} furore in the press, which portrayed them as anti-Semitic and distasteful. However, Morgan's comments were factual, based on military intelligence. It was {{reported at the}} time in Time magazine that: [...] "Observers here ... are positive of [...] sincerity, and <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no intention of feeding the fires of anti-Semitic propaganda." [...] Archibald MacLeish, a former Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, stated that when the press had finished with Sir Frederick, [...] "..the sum total effect was a lie and a disastrous and evil lie. [...] This brings up the question of journalistic standards. In a world as closely integrated as this one is, the question must be asked: what is the standard of truth in journalism? When the journalist is dealing with an inflammatory subject and so reports it that verbally his story is true, but the overall effect is false, are the standards of truth satisfied?" ...|$|E

2500|$|About two {{kilometres}} {{from the}} summit of the day's main climb, Mont Ventoux, Simpson began to zig-zag across the road, eventually falling against an embankment. Manning was a serious and well-respected journalist. His exposure, the first time a formal connection had been made between drugs and Simpson's death, set off a wave of similar reporting in Britain and elsewhere. The following month, Manning went further, in a piece headed [...] "Evidence in the case of Simpson who crossed the frontier of endurance without being able to <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> 'had enough'": ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{subsequent}} interviews, Olbermann {{went into}} greater {{detail about the}} circumstances surrounding his exit from MSNBC. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published on June 7, 2011, Olbermann said he had faced increasing opposition from network management after Tim Russert died in 2008, because the Meet the Press moderator had been his ally and a peacemaker at the network. He further stated that [...] "there were {{lots of people who}} were forced to choose sides" [...] over his presence at MSNBC, including Maddow. Olbermann further stated that he didn't <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been released from his MSNBC contract until less than a half-hour before his on-air farewell.|$|E

[...] At another point [...] "it seemed like he was pulling out a gun and the barrel just kept coming." [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> an object and it was dark. And he was pulling it out with his right hand."He added: [...] "It was, to me, it just looked big and apparent that he's gonna shoot you, he's gonna kill you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} stage of the Tour de France Sagan came in third. He then won the second stage, which {{featured}} a finish on a category 3 climb, to claim the yellow jersey {{for the first time in}} his career. He mentioned that he did not <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> won upon reaching the finish line, thinking more riders from the breakaway had crossed the line before him. Sagan was part of the breakaway on stage 10. He finished second to Michael Matthews and won the most combative award for his efforts. On the very next stage, Sagan broke away with yellow jersey wearer Chris Froome, Geraint Thomas and his teammate Maciej Bodnar in the final kilometers. He outsprinted Froome to foil the sprinters' plans. After the stage, asked why he undertook such a daring move, he said: [...] "We are artists". Sagan claimed his 3rd victory by winning stage 16 in Bern, beating Alexander Kristoff in a sprint by few centimetres. He finished second to Greipel on the last stage in the Champs Élysées, securing his green jersey. He also was elected [...] "most combative" [...] rider of the whole Tour.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} month of the season, Schmeichel was shown a {{seemingly}} needless red card in the 79th minute of Leicester's away game to Nottingham Forest on 20 August 2011 after receiving two yellow cards for [...] "unsporting conduct". He received the first card for moving the ball from the penalty spot as Forest's Lewis McGugan was about to take a kick, then received his second for throwing the ball away after the spot kick was successfully converted. After the match, Schmeichel apologized, claiming his back was turned to the referee so did not <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> received the first of the yellow cards. [...] "I didn't know I had been booked as I had my back to the ref otherwise I would never have done that," [...] he said on his personal Twitter page. Despite this, Schmeichel's performances for Leicester quickly began earning him plaudits, with his then manager Sven-Göran Eriksson comparing him with England number 1 goalkeeper Joe Hart, and teammate and former England international Paul Konchesky describing him as [...] "one of the best [...] he has ever played with". [...] A short-distant reaction save against Portsmouth in November 2011, in particular, earnt Schmeichel praise and was described by Portsmouth manager Michael Appleton as [...] "one of the best saves I have seen in a very long time". and by Leicester manager Nigel Pearson as [...] "a world-class, outstanding save and was very important at that point of the game".|$|E
