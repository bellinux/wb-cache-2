40|$|The {{volume is}} {{designed}} to provide a reference text for all those concerned with selecting and growing trees and shrubs in rural areas of developing countries and in the more tropical parts of Australia. The purpose of this first chapter is to provide an introduction to the main features of the Australian environment within which the trees and shrubs described in the book have evolved. Emphasis is on those factors of the environment for which data are likely to be available in field situations in other countries where Australian trees and shrubs might be used, so facilitating the initial selection of species through the use of <b>homoclimes.</b> Such information has much more predictive value than observed natural occurrence, which can be limited by various factors such as fire and competition, which in turn may change, and gives no indication of adaptability or plasticity of potentially useful species. As moisture availability and temperature are very important influences on the survival and growth of plants, this chapter concentrates on these factors...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} the {{scientific}} literature and industry experience with the Sharnae greater lotus (Lotus uliginosus Schkuhr) germplasm in Australia. The purpose is to assess the merits and limitations of Sharnae based on knowledge and experience that was not available when Sharnae was first registered for release in 1991. Sharnae was subsequently withdrawn from commerce in 1998. This review is intended to inform a consideration of the potential for commercialising Sharnae for use in low latitude environments, and to promote awareness of the availability of Sharnae (and other similar germplasms) for future cultivar development or evaluation work in low latitude <b>homoclimes</b> of eastern Austalia. Key words: pasture legume(s), plant improvement Of the wide species diversity in the Lotus genus that comprises some 200 species (Kirkbride, 1999), two species (L. australis, L. cruentis) are endemic to Australia, and four exotic species (L. angustissimus, L. suaveoleus, L. corniculatus, L. uliginosus) have naturalised (Wilson, 1980). Of these, only L. corniculatus (birdsfoot trefoil) and L. uliginosus (greater lotus) are presently in commercial use as pasture plants (Blumenthal and McGraw, 1999). While the potential zone of adaptation of both birdsfoot trefoil and greater lotus in Australi...|$|E
40|$|The annual {{rates of}} growth (on {{the basis of}} dry weight and of solar energy fixed) and {{nutrient}} uptakes of garrigue, chaparral, heath, and mallee-broombush growing in the Mediterranean type homoclime of southern France, California, and southern Australia were compared during the first 10 years of succession following fire. The Australian and Californian communities have an essentially similar growth rate of 640 - 2000 kg/ha/yr. The growth rate of the chaparral may be slightly {{greater than that of}} the Australian communities owing to greater availability of the nutrients phosphorus and potassium. The application of phosphorus fertilizer will increase the growth rate of Australian heath to that of the chaparral. Observations of Long et al. (1967) made on garrigue 10 km north of Montpellier, France indicate a growth rate of c. 1500 kg/ha/yr, essentially {{similar to that of the}} Australian and Californian communities. The author’s data for a dense, vigorous stand of garrigue growing on relatively fertile calcareous soil 13 km north-west of Montpellier reveal an annual growth rate of 4000 - 4200 kg/ha/yr. The growth rates of these distinctive plant communities, composed of entirely different species, are largely controlled by the major factors — solar radiation and available water. In similar <b>homoclimes</b> essentially the same growth rate results. Within limits, soil fertility will play a minor role in controlling the growth rate and consequently the nature of the resultant plant community...|$|E

50|$|The {{region is}} part of the Southern Tablelands about 150 km inland from the Pacific Ocean. The region {{receives}} moderate, but variable rainfall, and vineyards require supplemental irrigation in most years. Typical vineyard elevations range between 500 and 900 m, and the inland location result in relatively high continentality, possibly explaining the affinity for leading varieties Shiraz and Riesling. Promising recent results from Tempranillo may be explained by the strong <b>homoclime</b> to Ribera del Duero.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{potential}} {{distribution of the}} invasive perennial Solidago canadensis in China was assessed by using the <b>homoclime</b> approach. This alien weed spreads rapidly in China, invading abandoned fields and disturbed habitats. It is currently abundant in four provinces of southeastern China, with scattered populations in other provinces to the West and North. We used a climatic profile from the native American range and matched it with data from climatic stations throughout China. To map the {{potential distribution}} in China, data were extrapolated to form a grid of 0. 1 degree latitude by 0. 1 degree longitude. Grid points that fall within the climatic profile are assumed to circumscribe the potential distribution. The potential range in China is remarkably larger than the current range, with parts of northeastern China appearing suitable for S. canadensis growth. The latitudes of the potential range span from 25 ° to 50 °. The results show the considerable potential for future spread of S. canadensis in China, implying that control measures {{should be taken to}} contain this invasive species. Key words China, <b>homoclime</b> approach, invasive alien plant, potential distribution, prediction, Solidago canadensis. Predicting the potential ranges of invasive alien plants has important ramifications fo...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) {{has been}} {{traditionally}} grown in India {{but is a}} relatively new export crop in Australia where its cultivation is expanding into new areas. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify <b>homoclimes</b> (i. e. similar chickpea-growing environments) in themajor chickpea-growing areas of the 2 countries, using theAgricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) chickpeamodel. Themodel, which processes climatic, soil, and plant information on a daily time step, was first validated and then used to simulate flowering, maturity, and grain yield of Amethyst, a mid-season cultivar, andBarwon, a full-season cultivar, on low (100 mm),medium (150 mm), andhigh (190 mm) water-holding capacity soils, using historical climatic data of 67 Australian and 24 Indian locations. The mean of annual outputs of flowering, maturity, and grain yield of the 2 cultivars on 3 soils was then clustered using Ward’s hierarchical complete linkage clustering procedure. At a 90 % level of similarity, all the locations could be grouped into 6 homoclime clusters. The Australian locations appearedmorediverse as theywerepresent in all the clusters,whereas the Indian locationswerepresent only inclusters 1, 2, and 6. While therewere clear geographical patternsof spreadof these clusters, inAustralia theywerenot entirely related to latitude. The cluster 1 and 2 locations,which represent the largest chickpea-growing area inAustralia, had homoclime locations in common with northern India. The clustering of locations appeared generally consistent with the known adaptation of chickpea in different environments of the 2 countries and therefore suggests that the methodology could be potentially used for complementing conventional approaches of introducing or exchanging germplasm, as well as determining appropriateness of breeding/testing sites...|$|E
