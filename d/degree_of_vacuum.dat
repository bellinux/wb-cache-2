40|$|As many of {{the dairy}} powders {{manufactured}} have to travel long distances to reach their customers, both domestically and internationally, there is considerable interest among dairy powder manufacturers to maintain {{the quality of their}} products for relatively long storage periods. Dairy powders can have a long shelf life if packaged and stored properly. Vacuum packaging can be an attractive packaging strategy to maintain the quality of dairy powders and provide added value by improving the efficiency of using the storage space; because of the inherent compactness <b>of</b> these products. <b>Vacuum</b> packaged dry dairy ingredients may also have added ease of handling for end users.

The requirements grow increasingly stringent with the desired <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>vacuum</b> achievable in the vacuum chamber.The materials can produce gas by several mechanisms. Molecules of gases and water can be adsorbed on the material surface (therefore materials with low affinity to water have to be chosen, which eliminates many plastics). Materials may sublimate in vacuum (this excludes some metals and their alloys, most notably cadmium and zinc). Or the gases can be released from porous materials or from cracks and crevices. Traces of lubricants, residues from machining, can be present on the surfaces. A specific risk is outgassing of solvents absorbed in plastics after cleaning.|$|E

40|$|In a {{thorough}} paper Kuchaˇr {{has examined the}} canonical reduction of the most general action functional describing the geometrodynamics of the maximally extended Schwarzschild geometry. This reduction yields the true <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom for (<b>vacuum)</b> spherically symmetric general relativity (SSGR). The essential technical ingredient in Kuchaˇr’s analysis is a canonical transformation to a certain chart on the gravitational phase space which features the Schwarzschild mass parameter M S, {{expressed in terms of}} what are essentially Arnowitt-Deser-Misner variables, as a canonical coordinate. (Kuchaˇr’s paper complements earlier work by Kastrup and Thiemann, based mostly on Ashtekar variables, which has also explicitly isolated the true <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom for <b>vacuum</b> SSGR.) In this paper we discuss the geometric interpretation of Kuchaˇr’s canonical transformation in terms of the theory of quasilocal energy-momentum in general relativity given by Brown and York.

Furthermore, our formalism is general enough to cover the case <b>of</b> (<b>vacuum)</b> twodimensional dilaton gravity. Therefore, besides reviewing Kuchaˇr’s original work for Schwarzschild black holes from the framework of hyperbolic geometry, we present new results concerning the canonical reduction of Wittenblack-hole geometrodynamics. Finally, addressing a recent work of Louko and Whiting, we discuss some delicate points concerning the canonical reduction of the “thermodynamical action, ” which is of central importance in the path-integral formulation of gravitational thermodynamics...|$|R

We knew that the vacuum of an incandescent lamp of good quality is comparable to that of the Hittorf or Crookes tubes, and that, furthermore, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>vacuum</b> in such lamps improves significantly after illuminating 100 or more hours.

5000|$|While {{the term}} Radiometer {{can refer to}} any device that {{measures}} electromagnetic radiation (e.g. light), the term {{is often used to}} refer specifically to a Crookes radiometer ("light-mill"), a device invented in 1873 in which a rotor (having vanes which are dark on one side, and light on the other) in a partial vacuum spins when exposed to light. A common belief (one originally held even by Crookes) is that the momentum of the absorbed light on the black faces makes the radiometer operate. If this were true however, the radiometer would spin away from the non-black faces, since the photons bouncing off those faces impart more momentum than the photons absorbed on the black faces. Photons do exert radiation pressure on the faces, but those forces are dwarfed by other effects.The currently accepted explanation depends on having just the right <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>vacuum,</b> and relates to the transfer of heat rather than the direct effect of photons.|$|E

40|$|Vacuum energy {{remains the}} {{simplest}} model of dark energy which could drive the accelerated {{expansion of the}} Universe without necessarily introducing any new <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom.

Although the four-velocity <b>of</b> <b>vacuum</b> energy is undefined, an interacting vacuum has an energy transfer and the vacuum energy defines a particular foliation of spacetime with spatially homogeneous vacuum energy in cosmological solutions. It is possible to give a consistent description <b>of</b> <b>vacuum</b> dynamics {{and in particular the}} relativistic equations of motion for inhomogeneous perturbations given a covariant prescription for the vacuum energy, or equivalently the energy transfer four-vector, and we construct gauge-invariant vacuum perturbations.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper it is claimed that vacuum {{birefringence}} has been experimentally observed {{for the first}} time by measuring the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> polarization of visible light from a magnetar candidate, a neutron star with a magnetic field presumably as large as 10 ^ 13 G. The role of such a strong magnetic field is twofold. First, the surface of the star emits, at each point, polarized light with linear polarization correlated with the orientation of the magnetic field. Depending on the relative orientation of the magnetic axis of the star with the direction to the distant observer, a certain <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> polarization should be visible. Second, the strong magnetic field in the vacuum surrounding the star could enhance the effective <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> polarization observed: <b>vacuum</b> birefringence.

40|$|The {{condensed}} matter examples, {{in which}} the effective gravity appears in the low-energy corner {{as one of the}} collective modes <b>of</b> quantum <b>vacuum,</b> provide a possible answer to the question, why the vacuum energy is so small. This answer comes from the fundamental ``trans-Planckian'' physics of quantum liquids. In the effective theory of the low energy <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> freedom the <b>vacuum</b> energy density is proportional to the fourth power of the corresponding ``Planck'' energy appropriate for this effective theory. However, from the exact ``Theory of Everything'' of the quantum liquid it follows that its vacuum energy density is exactly zero without fine tuning, if: there are no external forces acting on the liquid; there are no quasiparticles which serve as matter; no space-time curvature; and no boundaries which give rise to the Casimir effect. Each of these four factors perturbs the vacuum state and induces the nonzero value <b>of</b> the <b>vacuum</b> energy density <b>of</b> order of energy density of the perturbation. This is the reason, why one must expect that in each epoch the vacuum energy density is of order of matter density of the Universe or/and of its curvature...|$|R
