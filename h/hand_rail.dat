Each step has three twisted balusters, {{and there is}} a moulded <b>hand</b> <b>rail.</b> The staircase is situated in a hall with an 18th-century ceiling painting of pelicans, trumpets and swags.

25|$|Some of {{the earlier}} rear {{entrance}} buses had narrow doors, which slowed down boarding/alighting. As a result, these were widened during overhaul. By early 1922, two Edinburgh type buses were in service with a centre door layout, i.e. between the axles. Featuring a wide door with a central <b>hand</b> <b>rail,</b> and signage directing passengers to board {{on the right of}} it and alight on the left, early indications were that this not only speeded up boarding/alighting, it increased the space available for standees.|$|E
25|$|The red {{aspect is}} usually {{positioned}} {{at the bottom}} of pole and gantry mounted signals is so that snow does not build up on the lens hood of an aspect placed below the red aspect, resulting in the aspect becoming obscured. Similarly it is placed {{at the top of a}} ground mounted signal to minimize the risk of the red aspect becoming obscured by snow build up on the ground. Signal alignment is generally aimed towards a distance 200 yards (183 metres) in rear of the signal and at a height of 2.5 to 3 m from the left <b>hand</b> <b>rail.</b> Ground mounted signals are rarely so critical for alignment (hence ground mounting) and are often used in tunnels where the relative luminosity of the aspects are much higher.|$|E

2500|$|The Hidden Canyon Trail {{was built}} in 1928 under the {{guidance}} of Guy D. Edwards and F.A. Kittredge to provide access to a hanging canyon. The trail consists of three sections. [...] The first section starts at the East Rim Trail and runs for [...] as a horse trail with eleven switchbacks with dry-laid sandstone retaining walls. The [...] section was built as a hikers-only trail along a natural shelf, with a small section of blasted passage with steps and a <b>hand</b> <b>rail.</b> [...] The final section was blasted from a steep slope by workers hanging from ropes. The completed work was designed to blend into the landscape, while vegetation was preserved during construction. The Hidden Canyon Trail was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 14, 1987, reference number 86003731.|$|E
60|$|So he {{rose from}} the sofa, and began to stagger along toward {{the door of the}} saloon. He found, however, that after all he felt {{somewhat}} giddy and light headed; and he concluded, therefore, that, instead of going to dinner, he would go up on deck and see how the wind was. He accordingly turned to the staircase which led up to the main deck, and steadying himself by the <b>hand</b> <b>rail</b> as he ascended the steps, he went up.|$|E

He could spring from the floor, catch the <b>hand</b> <b>rail</b> of the runway above, and swing himself with a single effort to the upper cells. Every possible combination of strength and agility which the slender variety of means allowed he used, {{and not one of}} all the prisoners cared to try muscular conclusions with him. Occasionally a new prisoner would experiment, but those who held over knew better than to [...] "bother the kid." [...] When a rash and doubting man tried it, he repented it in cotton cloth and arnica.|$|E
