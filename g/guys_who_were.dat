500|$|Dworsky was a {{four-year}} starter under Michigan's legendary coach, Fritz Crisler. Dworsky later said that Crisler's [...] "real genius" [...] was in blending all the elements. The 1947 championship team included several older veteran players who {{had returned from}} military service. Dworsky recalled: [...] "About half of us were 18-year old kids, and half were veterans. We had <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> serious guys and <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> excitable.

500|$|Describing the {{selection}} process, early contributor Chris Vrenna told Gannett News [...] "coming {{from the same}} emotional background, I feel, {{is more important than}} how well you can play your instrument. That's one reason that makes our shows more intense when we're up there ... We found people that understood that. It makes us stronger". [...] Reznor described his selection of the earliest incarnations of the live band by saying [...] "I'm not in the position to offer somebody a thousand dollars a week to rehearse ... So I took some young <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> malleable, who would basically do what I want them to do but expand on it. [...] The only context I've worked with them in so far is, 'Here are the songs, here are your parts, learn them.' [...] " ...|$|E

500|$|Box Car Racer, {{intended}} as a one-time experimental project, became a full-fledged band with Barker behind the kit and Hazen Street guitarist David Kennedy on guitar. Blink bassist Mark Hoppus felt betrayed and jealous, and it would create an unresolved tension within the trio that followed the band for several years. [...] "At the end of 2001, it felt like Blink-182 had broken up. It wasn’t spoken about, but it felt over", said Hoppus later. Barker, meanwhile, joined rap rock group Transplants in 2002 and was featured on their first album, Transplants. In addition, Blink-182 co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Green Day, alongside opening acts Jimmy Eat World, Saves the Day, and Kut U Up in 2002. It was an [...] "uncomfortable" [...] time in the band according to Hoppus, but they had [...] "hundreds of discussions about it" [...] and seemingly moved on. Barker felt {{the dynamics of the}} band changed with Hoppus and DeLonge's marriages: [...] "Blink-182 were no longer just three inseparable <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> touring together." [...] Meanwhile, he began dating model Shanna Moakler, inviting tabloid attention, adding to the [...] "awkwardness" [...] present in the band.|$|E
500|$|The last {{performance}} of the original Experience lineup took place on June 29, 1969, at Barry Fey's Denver Pop Festival, a three-day event held at Denver's Mile High Stadium that was marked by police using tear gas to control the audience. The band narrowly escaped from the venue {{in the back of}} a rental truck, which was partly crushed by fans who had climbed on top of the vehicle. Before the show, a journalist angered Redding by asking why he was there; the reporter then informed him that two weeks earlier Hendrix announced that he had been replaced with Billy Cox. The next day, Redding quit the Experience and returned to London. He announced that he had left the band and intended to pursue a solo career, blaming Hendrix's plans to expand the group without allowing for his input as a primary reason for leaving. Redding later commented: [...] "Mitch and I hung out a lot together, but we're English. If we'd go out, Jimi would stay in his room. But any bad feelings came from us being three <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> traveling too hard, getting too tired, and taking too many drugs... I liked Hendrix. I don't like Mitchell." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2010, casting calls {{revealed}} the film would be undergoing an undisclosed number of reshoots. In March 2011, scenes involving Adriana Barraza {{were removed from}} the theatrical cut of the film during the editing process. Branagh sent a letter of apology explaining the reasons for the cut and desire to work with Barraza again in the future. In response Barraza stated, [...] "It saddens me because the movie is great and because I was acting alongside some tremendous actors that I admire very much, but I understand the nature of films, and it's not the first or last time that scenes will be cut". Barraza appears in only one scene in the film's theatrical cut. In that same month, Douglas Tait revealed that he performed for motion capture of the Frost Giants. On his hiring, Tait said [...] "I am 6'5" [...] and have a lean, athletic build, and they hired <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> 6'7" [...] and taller, and weighed over [...] When the film was being edited, they wanted to make them even bigger and move faster. They auditioned people again and Kenneth Branagh chose me to perform the motion capture movements of the Frost Giants". In April 2011, the IMAX Corporation, Paramount Pictures and Marvel Entertainment announced that they have finalized an agreement to release the film in IMAX 3D, continuing the partnership which began on Iron Man 2. Branagh stated that the 3-D process initially made him cringe but said [...] "We came to feel that in our case 3-D could be the very good friend of story and character for a different kind of experience". Although the film was shot in 2D, Feige stated that the [...] "special effects for the film were conceived and executed from the beginning in 3D". The post-credits scene that sees Nick Fury approach Erik Selvig to ask him to study the Tesseract, was directed by The Avengerss director, Joss Whedon.|$|E
