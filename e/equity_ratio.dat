40|$|Problem formulation: This {{paper will}} {{examine how the}} capital {{structure}} of firms affects their market valuation by applying the Modigliani-Miller theory on Swedish listed companies in a boom and a recession. The study will examine whether {{it is possible to}} draw any conclusions as to whether companies with high debt to <b>equity</b> <b>ratios</b> are valued lower in a recession, in comparison to companies with low debt to <b>equity</b> <b>ratios.</b> Purpose: To empirically test the Modigliani-Miller theory of capital structure in a boom and a recession in order to see if the companies’ market value is affected differently depending on whether they have a high or a low debt to <b>equity</b> <b>ratios.</b> Methodology: The essay has a deductive and a quantitative methodological approach. Data analysis was done through a correlation analysis, a regression analysis and a hypothesis testing. Theory: The Modigliani-Miller theory of capital structure with taxes states that companies with a high debt to <b>equity</b> <b>ratios</b> has a higher value. One of the risks {{with a high level of}} debt could be that during a financial downturn companies have more difficulty realizing capital and are thus more likely to go bankrupt. Conclusions: The study shows results that are contrary to the Modigliani-Miller's theory; all the correlation analyses between debt to <b>equity</b> <b>ratios</b> and market value are negative. The strongest negative correlation can be found in the measurements at the end of 2009 when the impact of the recession is noted in the companies' financial reports. It should also be noted that companies with low debt to <b>equity</b> <b>ratios</b> fared proportionately better than the highly leveraged, with respect to the market valuation. The study also shows that high debt to <b>equity</b> <b>ratios</b> has a negative impact on return on equity during the recession...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} which institutional determinants are chiefly {{responsible for the}} fact that the capital structure of Austrian companies is dominated by debt. An international comparison shows that company taxation is generally not financing-neutral and, given the observed differences in <b>equity</b> <b>ratios</b> between countries, cannot be the primary factor influencing capital structure choice. Instead, the nature of creditor protections, which determine the position of investors and lenders in the event of bankruptcy, is probably a far more decisive factor. <b>Equity</b> <b>ratios</b> decline in parallel with creditor-friendly provisions across countries. Because of the predominance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Austria, the Hausbank principle plays an important role in determining capital structure. The associated intensive exchange of information between banks and companies allows borrowings to take on the functions usually performed by equity. In the future, financial market innovations and the transfer of severance pay and pension entitlements to outside institutions could have an influence on capital structure.

40|$|This thesis {{increases}} {{our understanding}} of the book-to-market ratio via a detailed examination of how and when earnings are realised in relation to firms' "capitalisation" and "average useful-life of assets". Book-to-market ratios (BMRs) are regressed as a function of changes in market value of <b>equity</b> <b>ratios</b> for British industrial companies registered on the London Stock Exchange from 1987 to 1996. Data from a prior period (1976 - 1986) is also employed to stabilise for effects of earnings realisation before the regression period. The "average useful-life assets" for the firms in the sample determines the time horizon of the analysis. The path of abnormal earnings over this horizon reflects the pattern of expiration of the useful-lives of assets in place. The analysis finds that an accrual measurement effect dominated in BMRs increases over the analysis period and also that accrual measurement is more influential in BMRs for firms with short than with long "average useful-life assets". Changes in market value ratios are found to inform about future earnings up to at least six years, except for highlycapitalised firms with long useful-life assets (for which the relationship lasts up to 4 years). The length of the informative period is found to be inverse to the average useful-life of firms' assets. The effect of differences between annual changes in market value of <b>equity</b> <b>ratios</b> on BMRs across time diminishes soon (two years) after the initial market shock' occurs. Long useful-life assets have no further effect on BMRs evolution at more distant lags. Contrary to previous research (in the USA), changes in market value of <b>equity</b> <b>ratios</b> (for UK firms) are found to be associated more with short than with long useful-life assets. Although not specially tested for, this result supports the notion of "short-terminism" of which the UK stock market is sometimes accused. The apparent "short-terministic" outlook by investors in UK firms coincides with improved predictability of BMRs in the UK compared with the US market. The high coefficients of determination from changes in market value of <b>equity</b> <b>ratios</b> as a function of BMRs, identified in the study, motivates a further test for a prediction model which is able to predict 29. 2...|$|R

40|$|There are {{numerous}} myths {{that surround the}} financial crisis that began in August 2007. Some of these myths are {{about the role of}} bank credit in the crisis, while others concern the weakness of the U. S. banking system and supposed excess leverage—the ratio of assets to equity in banks [...] in contributing to the crisis. This paper provides evidence that net new commercial and industrial loans at banks did not slow before the financial crisis began in August 2007, nor was there any slowing in the early months. A subsequent slowing did reach its lowest pace in June-August 2008, but even at its worst, it was not particularly severe. The paper also looks at the safety and soundness of banks as indicated by their equity-assets ratio. The concern is that bank assets are troubled and excessively leveraged, with very low equity-asset ratios so that banks could have to “deleverage” or reduce lending as their equity declines. The shrinkage of bank equity and assets due to deleveraging could deepen the recession. But banks have not suffered significant declines in their <b>equity</b> <b>ratios</b> and they have been holding near record <b>equity</b> <b>ratios.</b> Moreover bank assets are growing rapidly, with equity nearly keeping pace. Ironically the Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program will add $ 270 beginning in the fourth quarter. The TARP’s injections of bank capital have dried up private sector injections that had appeared on the horizon from sovereign wealth funds and private <b>equity.</b> <b>Equity</b> <b>ratios</b> of banks could become strained in future as total loans and assets continue to expand. The financial crisis has not undermined the safety and soundness of the commercial banking system. It is not likely to do so because most of the expected losses from the foreclosure crisis have already been taken into provisions. Nonetheless, many banks heavily exposed to mortgage losses have failed and more will fail. ...|$|R
