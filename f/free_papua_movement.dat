25|$|In 1996, Prabowo led the Mapenduma Operation in {{the mountainous}} terrain of Papua, Indonesia. The {{goal of the}} {{operation}} was the release of 11 scientific researchers, who had been taken hostage by the <b>Free</b> <b>Papua</b> <b>Movement.</b> The researchers were five Indonesians, four Britons, one Dutchman and his pregnant German wife. Two of the Indonesian male hostages were killed shortly before the rescue operation. The mission involved covert support from British Military Attache and SAS veteran Colonel Ivor Helberg. The operation was criticised for using the Red Cross emblem on a white helicopter to deceive the Papuan rebels. When the helicopter landed at Geselema, innocent villagers who {{had nothing to do}} with the kidnapping ran towards it, thinking it was their friends from the Red Cross. Instead, white gunmen and Indonesian soldiers jumped out and shot them dead. The <b>Free</b> <b>Papua</b> <b>Movement</b> had been in peaceful negotiations to release the hostages until this massacre sparked violence in which the two Indonesian hostages were killed.|$|E

From 1989 to 1997 the PNGDF was involved in fighting the secessionist Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) on Bougainville and Buka. More recently, following {{the passage of a}} constitutional amendment allowing the stationing of the PNGDF on foreign soil, 80 personnel joined the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) in July 2003. PNGDF troops continued to serve in the Solomon Islands as part of the scaled down, rotational Pacific contingent until the military component of RAMSI was withdrawn in 2013.|$|E

5000|$|The government's {{main concern}} has been to bolster the economy. In keeping with its need for {{financial}} assistance, Vanuatu has joined the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF). According to ABC Radio Australia, [...] "Foreign policy issues that feature in Vanuatu include wide support for the <b>Free</b> West <b>Papua</b> <b>Movement</b> and broadly for independence throughout Melanesia, the One China Policy and relations with Australia and New Zealand."

50|$|After {{arriving}} in the United Kingdom, Benny became the leading spokesperson for the <b>Free</b> West <b>Papua</b> Campaign, {{which was founded in}} 2004 by a group of pro-Papuan activists in Oxford. The campaign's stated aims are to spread awareness of the human rights situation and independence aspirations of the people of West Papua, through lobbying governments and developing support throughout civil society. The <b>Free</b> West <b>Papua</b> Campaign <b>movement</b> in the UK has grown to include permanent student groups at British universities and regional groups, as well as permanent offices in Oxford, the Hague and Port Moresby.|$|R
40|$|West Papua {{has one of}} {{the most}} repressive media environments in the world with a long history of media {{censorship}} and banning of foreign journalists, and only recently has this policy been somewhat relaxed. The tight media restrictions has led to the increasing use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter by West Papuan activists who broadcast the atrocities and human rights violations committed in West Papua. Driven by ICT developments, Pacific Islanders are increasingly “switching on” and leveraging social media as a political tool. Digital tools such as hashtags are being used to organize, share and disseminate stories and Free West Papuan messages. This has garnered support from all over the world and created “digital villages” of Free West Papuan activists. The Free West Papuan campaign has received an unprecedented level of global attention with prominent politicians such as PNG’s Prime Minister, Peter O’Neil, coming out in support of West Papua with reference to graphic images posted on social media. This paper illustrates how social media is ushering in a new wave of Pacific activism and also fostering the rebirth of bottom-up regionalism in the Pacific using the case of the <b>Free</b> West <b>Papua</b> <b>Movement...</b>|$|R
25|$|Following the Act of Free Choice {{plebiscite}} in 1969, Western New Guinea {{was formally}} {{integrated into the}} Republic of Indonesia. Instead of a referendum of the 816,000 Papuans, only 1,022 Papuan tribal representatives were allowed to vote {{and all of these}} were coerced into voting in favour of integration. While several international observers including journalists and diplomats criticised the referendum as being rigged, the United States and Australia support Indonesia's efforts to secure acceptance in the United Nations for the pro-integration vote. That same year, 84 member states voted in favour for the United Nations to accept the result, with 30 others abstaining. Due to the Netherlands' efforts to promote a West Papuan national identity, a significant number of Papuans refused to accept the territory's integration into Indonesia. These formed the separatist Organisasi Papua Merdeka (<b>Free</b> <b>Papua</b> <b>Movement)</b> and have waged an insurgency against the Indonesian authorities, which still continues to this day.|$|E
2500|$|Nowadays the Acehnese and West Papuan {{autonomy}} movements currently use {{the term}} to express the concept of freedom, {{and the meaning of}} the term ranges from greater freedom to outright political independence. The major autonomy movement in Aceh, the Free Aceh Movement has the term in its name (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka), as does the major armed independence group in West Papua, the <b>Free</b> <b>Papua</b> <b>Movement</b> (Organisasi Papua Merdeka). Nowadays too, some conservative and Nationalists had re-thought the 'Merdeka' stance of Indonesia, many question related to it such as [...] "Apakah kita benar-benar sudah merdeka?" [...] (Had we been really independent?). They used the term Merdeka as a motivational battle cry to the public for a change against the increasing free-fight liberalism, globalization, and neo-imperialism in terms of capitalism in Indonesia, though the word [...] "Semangat Reformasi" [...] (Spirit of the Reformation) had since now more been used.|$|E

40|$|A {{substantive}} {{dialogue between}} the Indonesian government and Papuan leaders could help stem political radicalisation in the country’s easternmost province, according to this report. This report charts the radicalisation of activists from the central highlands, the province’s mountainous spine, and links {{a small group of}} them, the pro-independence National Committee for West Papua (Komite Nasional Papua Barat, KNPB),  to some of the violence that erupted in Papua in 2009. The KNPB is not broadly representative and its tactics are decried by other activists, but its message – that peaceful methods have failed to produce results – resonates more widely. A dialogue, if carefully prepared, offers the possibility of addressing longstanding grievances, without calling Indonesian sovereignty into question. But it will only succeed if all issues [...] political and historical, not just economic [...] are on the table, and President Yudhoyono gives it visible, public backing. The urgency of dialogue is underscored by the upsurge of violence {{in the second half of}} 2009 and early 2010. The report examines several incidents where members of the KNPB either claimed responsibility for the violence, although in one case playing no direct role, or appeared to be working in co-ordination with local guerrilla commanders of the <b>Free</b> <b>Papua</b> <b>Movement’s</b> National Liberation Army (Tentara Pembebasan Nasional/Organisasi Papua Merdeka, TPN/OPM). It also looks in detail at the shooting attacks near the giant Freeport copper and gold mine. In all cases, actions by security forces contributed to the problem, sometimes through poorly targeted arrests that angered the community or through demands for money that made the presence of troops a burden. Violence and radicalisation in Papua could increase unless political frustrations are addressed. The path to talks will not be easy, however. Some in the central government believe that any discussion of non-economic issues will only fuel support for independence. Some Papuan activists believe that dialogue should only take place with international mediation and with the political endgame left open. Even some of those who accept Indonesian sovereignty as a given believe that Jakarta has a history of promising but not delivering. But the radicalisation of the KNPB is proof of the dangers of leaving political grievances to fester. Papua is not the land of horrors that some activists would like to portray. It has huge problems, but there also have been huge changes over the last decade. The Indonesian government repeatedly shoots itself in the foot by restricting access and preventing a full picture of Papua from emerging. Image: deepchi 1 / flick...|$|R

5000|$|In October 1968, Nicolaas Jouwe, {{member of}} the New Guinea Council and of the National Committee elected by the Council in 1962, lobbied the United Nations {{claiming}} 30,000 Indonesian troops and thousands of Indonesian civil servants were repressing the Papuan population. According to US Ambassador Galbraith, the Indonesian Foreign Minister Adam Malik also believed the Indonesian military {{was the cause of}} problems in the territory and the number of troops should be reduced by at least one half. Ambassador Galbraith further described the OPM to [...] "represent an amorphous mass of anti-Indonesia sentiment" [...] and that [...] "possibly 85 to 90 percent Papuans, are in sympathy with the <b>Free</b> <b>Papua</b> cause or at least intensely dislike Indonesians".|$|R
50|$|Relations {{between the}} two have been marred by the separatist {{intentions}} of the West <b>Papua</b> <b>Movement.</b> Additionally, the Republik Maluku Selatan also seeks separation from Indonesia. In this vein, they have attacked targets in the Netherlands in the 1970s and 1980s, seeking to force the country to pressure Indonesia into allowing for the secession of their nation. Political ties were then strained as Indonesian officials refused to visit the Netherlands while the group was allowed to bring cases to court against them. In 2010, the Indonesia president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, cancelled {{a visit to the}} Netherlands after the group's activists asked a Dutch court to issue an arrest warrant for him.
