5|$|Following World War I (a {{period when}} the Machine Gun Corps was based in the park, as {{referred}} to in Henry Williamson's Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight), the Brownlows, like many of their peers, were faced with mounting financial problems. In 1984 they gave the house away—complete with most of its contents. The recipients of their gift, the National Trust, today fully open Belton to the public. It is in a <b>good</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> and visited by many thousands of tourists each year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money {{restoring}} Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a <b>good</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{follows the}} current {{trends in the}} field of maintenance, proposing {{approaches}} that fit in the concept of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM). First it is presented a new proposal for tracking in-service machine tools. This is based on the identification of three operating states: <b>good</b> running condition, <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> and stationary <b>state.</b> During the stationary state there are differentiated two distinct types of stops: natural stays and unproductive stays (those who often produce considerable losses). Based on the information contained in the records made for tracking the operation of machine tools there are proposed formulas for calculating some operational indicators and practical ways of using modern methods for the maintenance management of machine tools and for making preventive maintenance activities that lead to increased efficiency of machine tool operation. The proposals presented in this paper are applicable to all manufacturing companies and generate best practices that can be implemented in various industries...|$|R
2500|$|The use {{of stone}} {{construction}} in Finland was initially {{limited to the}} few medieval castles and churches in the country. The construction of castles {{was part of a}} project by the Swedish crown to construct both defensive and administrative centres throughout Finland. Six castles of national importance were built during the medieval period, from {{the second half of the}} 13th century onwards: Kastelholma on the Åland Islands, Turku, and Raseborg on the south-west coast, Vyborg on an islet off the south-east coast and Häme and Olavinlinna further inland. The northern-most castle, and situated even further inland, Kajaani, dates from the beginning of the 17th century. Kuusisto, on an island of the same name, and Korsholma on the coast also dates from this later period. The earlier parts of the castle constructions are characterised by heavy granite boulder constructions, but with ever more refined details in later periods. Strategically, the two most important castle were that of Turku and Vyborg. The three high-medieval Finnish [...] "castle fiefs" [...] were ruled until the 1360s from the castles of Turku, Hämeenlinna and Vyborg. By the beginning of the 14th century, Turku Castle was one of the largest in northern Europe, with over 40 rooms and by the mid-16th century received further changes to withstand cannon fire. Construction of Vyborg castle started in 1293 by order of Torkel Knutsson, Lord High Constable of Sweden. The documentation for the construction of Olavinlinna is unusually clear: it was founded precisely in 1475 by a Danish-born knight, Erik Axelsson Tott who worked in the service of the Swedish crown and was also governor of Vyborg castle; the castle's strategic significance, along with Vyborg castle, was to protect the eastern border from the Novgorod Republic to the east. According to Axelsson's own account, the castle was built by [...] "16 good foreign master masons" [...] - some of them from Tallinn. The castle is built on an island in the Kyrönsalmi strait that connects the lakes Haukivesi and Pihlajavesi; the design was based on the idea of 3 large towers in a line facing north-west and an encircling wall. The castle's present <b>good</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> is due to a thorough restoration carried out in the 1960s and 70s. Häme Castle, the oldest parts built in stone, said to originate in the 1260s, was originally built in wood, then rebuilt in stone, but then transformed radically in the 14th century in red brick, unique for Finland, with extra lines of defence also in brick added beyond the central bastion. In the 19th century it was converted into a prison in accordance with a design by architect Carl Ludvig Engel.|$|E

60|$|Unfortunately, the English fleet was {{far less}} {{prepared}} than the land forces. The militia had been easily and cheaply extemporized, but a fleet can only be prepared by long and painful sacrifices. The entire English navy contained but thirteen ships of over four hundred tons, and including small cutters and pinnaces there were but thirty- eight vessels of all sorts and sizes carrying the queen's flag. Fortunately, Sir John Hawkins was {{at the head of}} the naval administration, and in spite of the parsimony of Elizabeth had kept the fleet in a <b>good</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> and equipment. The merchant navy, although numerous, was equally deficient in vessels of any size.|$|E

60|$|After bidding {{farewell}} to Conde, and thanking {{him for his}} hospitality, Hector started immediately the midday meal was concluded. His cavalcade made a good show as he rode {{through the streets of}} Paris, with the four orderlies behind him, splendidly mounted, followed by Paolo leading another fine horse carrying baggage. The journey was an uneventful one, and on arriving at the castle of Villar, Hector was received by the royal intendant. It was still a place of considerable strength, standing on the crest of a hill. It had been kept in a <b>good</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> by the intendant, and could offer a stout resistance to anything short of an army provided with a powerful battering train. On making a tour of the estate Hector found that here, as throughout France, an immense amount of distress existed, owing to the crushing taxation rendered necessary by the war; he made minute inquiries of the intendant of the circumstances of the various tenants of the estate.|$|E
