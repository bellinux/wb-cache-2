5|$|A breed society, the Jacob Sheep Society, {{was formed}} in July 1969. Mary Cavendish, dowager Duchess of Devonshire, who had a <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> Jacob sheep at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, was the first {{president}} of the society. From 1972 onwards, the society published a flock book.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{possible}} to teach a migration route to a <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> birds, for example in re-introduction schemes.

5|$|Longleat Estate has fenced off a {{large part}} of its land and has {{introduced}} goats, as part of a programme to encourage the biodiversity of the area; the goats were intended to replace the sheep that grazed in the gorge until the 1970s. The National Trust announced in March 2007 that it plans to release a <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> sheep on its side of the gorge for the same purpose, but will first consult local residents and interested parties on whether to fence off the gorge or introduce cattle grids to prevent the sheep from straying. There is already a small <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> feral Soay sheep in the gorge.|$|E

5|$|The First World War {{badly damaged}} the {{remaining}} duck industry in Buckinghamshire, wiping out the small scale producers and {{leaving only a}} few large farms. Disruption caused by the Second World War further damaged the industry. By the 1950s only one significant <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> Aylesbury ducks remained in Buckinghamshire, and by 1966 there were no duck-breeding or -rearing businesses of any size remaining in Aylesbury itself. Although {{there is only one}} surviving <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> pure Aylesbury ducks in the United Kingdom and the breed is critically endangered in the United States, the Aylesbury duck remains a symbol of the town of Aylesbury, and appears on the coat of arms of Aylesbury and on the club badge of Aylesbury United.|$|E
5|$|A leucistic Coragyps atratus brasiliensis was {{observed}} in Piñas, Ecuador in 2005. It had white plumage overall, with only the tarsus and tail {{as well as some}} undertail feathers being black. It was not an albino as its skin seemed to have had the normal, dark color and {{it was part of a}} <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> some twenty normally plumaged individuals.|$|E
500|$|Difficulties in {{distinguishing}} Australian corvids has hampered {{understanding of}} seasonal movements.

Juvenile birds leave their parents and join flocks when they are four or five months old. Smaller <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> 8–30 birds stay within an area of around 260 square kilometres, while larger <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> up to 300birds may travel hundreds of kilometres seeking food.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In the European Union (EU), {{targets are}} being {{set for the}} {{reduction}} of certain zoonotic Salmonella serovars in different animal populations, including poultry populations, {{within the framework of}} Regulation (EC) No. 2160 / 2003 on the control of zoonoses. For a three-year transitional period, the EU targets were to cover only Salmonella Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium (and in addition S. Hadar, S. Infantis and S. Virchow for breeding <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> Gallus gallus). Before the end of that transitional period, the revision of the EU targets was to be considered, including the potentially addition of other serovars with public health significance to the permanent EU targets. This review article aims at providing an overview of the assessments carried out by the Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards of the European Food Safety Authority in the field of setting targets for Salmonella in poultry populations (breeding <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> Gallus gallus, laying <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> Gallus gallus, broiler <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> Gallus gallus and <b>flocks</b> <b>of</b> breeding and fattening turkeys...|$|R

5|$|As {{with other}} mammals, {{domestic}} sheep reproduction occurs sexually. Their reproductive strategy {{is very similar}} to other domestic herd animals. A <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> sheep is generally mated by a single ram, which has either been chosen by a farmer or has established dominance through physical contest with other rams (in feral populations). Most sheep have a breeding season (tupping) in the autumn, though some are able to breed year-round.|$|E

As in the {{previous}} version, the Ulstermen go hunting a <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> magical birds, are overtaken by a snowstorm and seek shelter in a nearby house. Their host is Lug, but this time his wife, who gives birth to a son that night, is Deichtine herself. The child is named Sétanta.|$|E

He became famous in London and Boston for recovering a large treasure from a sunken Spanish galleon, a feat that earned him instant wealth and a knighthood.|$|E
5|$|Causes {{of death}} of adult ibis {{are not well}} known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises {{but there has been}} little {{research}} in the area. A <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which suggested they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they {{had not been able to}} fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos are diurnal {{and require}} {{daylight}} {{to find their}} food. They are not early risers, instead waiting until the sun has warmed their roosting sites before feeding. All species are generally highly social and roost, forage and travel in colourful and noisy flocks. These vary in size depending on availability of food; in times of plenty, flocks are small and number a hundred birds or less, while in droughts or other times of adversity, they may swell up to contain thousands or even {{tens of thousands of}} birds; one record from the Kimberley noted a <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> 32,000 little corellas. Species that inhabit open country form larger flocks than those of forested areas.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, Calafia is a pagan who is {{convinced}} to raise {{an army of}} women warriors and sail away from California with a large <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> trained griffins {{so that she can}} join a Muslim battle against Christians who are defending Constantinople. In the siege, the griffins harm enemy and friendly forces, so they are withdrawn. Calafia and her ally Radiaro fight in single combat against the Christian leaders, a king and his son the knight Esplandián. Calafia is bested and taken prisoner, and she converts to Christianity. She marries a cousin of Esplandián and returns with her army to California for further adventures.|$|E
5|$|Jacobs {{were first}} {{exported}} to North America {{in the early}} 20th century. Some individuals acquired them from zoos in the 1960s and 1970s, but the breed remained rare in America until the 1980s; registration began in 1985. The first North American association for the breed, the Jacob Sheep Breeders Association, was established in 1989. The Jacob was introduced to Israel in 2016, when a small <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> about 120 head was shipped there from Canada by a couple who believes the breed {{is the same one}} mentioned in Genesis.|$|E

5|$|New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they locate carcasses. The turkey vulture has a red head. The black vulture has a grey head. Although not a water bird, a <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> black vultures at the Myakka River State Park, southeast of Sarasota, has been seen bathing {{at the edge of the}} lake and then drying out their wings in the same way as cormorants like the Florida anhinga. This habit may help free them of parasites.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} sermons I have ever been privileged to hear was by the late Bishop of Winchester. Social exclusion? He said {{virtually}} that if one sheep from a <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> 100 goes missing, the good shepherd worries frantically about that single sheep until it is safely found. There are too many sheep, men, women and children, being marginalised. John the Baptist had the answer: why do we not? I remain concerned in these turbulent times, but {{thank you for your}} patience. It has been my privilege to be able to speak in your Lordships' House.|$|E
5|$|The mallard usually feeds by dabbling {{for plant}} food or grazing; {{there are reports}} of it eating frogs. However, in 2017 a <b>flock</b> <b>of</b> mallards in Romania were {{observed}} hunting small migratory birds, including grey wagtail and black redstart, the first documented occasion they had been seen attacking and consuming large vertebrates. It usually nests on a river bank, but not always near water. It is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and forms large flocks, which are known as sords.|$|E
