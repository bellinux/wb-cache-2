40|$|This Ph. D. thesis pursues two goals: The {{study of}} the {{geometrical}} structure of two-dimensional quantum gravity and in particular its fractal nature. To address these questions we review the continuum formalism of quantum gravity with special focus on the scaling properties of the theory. We discuss several concepts of fractal dimensions which characterize the extrinsic and intrinsic geometry of quantum gravity. This work is partly based on work done in collaboration with Jan Ambj{ø}rn, Dimitrij Boulatov, <b>Jakob</b> L. <b>Nielsen</b> and Yoshiyuki Watabiki (1997). The other goal is {{the discussion of the}} discretization of quantum gravity and to address the so called quantum failure of Regge calculus. We review dynamical triangulations and show that it agrees with the continuum theory in two dimensions. Then we discuss Regge calculus and prove that a continuum limit cannot be taken in a sensible way and that it does not reproduce continuum results. This work is partly based on work done in collaboration with Jan Ambj{ø}rn, <b>Jakob</b> L. <b>Nielsen</b> and George Savvidy (1997) ...|$|R
40|$|Websites {{have become}} an {{important}} tool for businesses to communicate to customers. Every business is required to have a website otherwise the business will somehow disappear in a market where other competitors have a website and are simply more accessible. Kunstbiblioteket is a business established in 1957 and specializes in renting out different paintings on a three week basis. Kunstbiblioteket struggles with their website that {{is not up to}} date and lacks some functions if you compare it to today's standards. In this project a redesign of Kunstbibliotekets current website have been developed using theory like the Gestalt Principles, <b>Jakob</b> <b>Nielsens</b> five principles of user-friendly web design, and Lisbeth Thorlacius’ communication model. The design process consisted of five iterations where the project utilized qualitative methods consisting of interviews with informants that both did and did not know of Kunstbiblioteket to get feedback from the different designs and iterations. Additionally the project also utilizes quantitative methods consisting of a questionnaire with different people from Kunstbibliotekets clientele. The results from the interviews and the questionnaire together with the design theory was used to develop different phases in the design process that eventually ended up with a more refined and user-friendly website...|$|R

40|$|Websites {{today only}} offer simpler form of {{technical}} analysis {{and are not}} fun to use, therefore student decided to build a website that makes technical analysis a bit more fun by giving user possibility to experiment with settings for technical indicators and also see clear visible results from analysis. Student decided to build website in ASP. NET. Technical indicators for this project only consist of those who give buy and sell-signals via cross-over, no divergence or pattern finding. This project has three questions that define this project. It’s important that there is good functionality so that performing an analysis is perceived as simple, one question is therefore; what functionality for website is needed in order for analysis {{to be perceived as}} more simple?Technical analysis is a pretty complex subject and demands an interface that is perceived as easy to understand and easy to use, it’s therefore important that the interface is well designed, second question is therefore; how should the interface be designed to be user-friendly?When systems grow large they often become hard to develop and later on unmaintainable because of the accumulated complexity and dependency between classes, the code is a mess, the last question is therefore; how can the systems complexity be eased with object-oriented design principles?Jakob Nielsens ten heuristics for User Interface Design were used as inspiration for designing the interface for the website. The system design follows SOLID principles, some pattern-design were also used because pattern-design often fulfills SOLID principles or makes for pretty good solutions in regular code-problems. At the beginning of the project the student did a small research {{to find out what was}} needed in order to complete project. Work-method for project follows agile development where decisions were made on a weekly basis. The project was divided into three phases where each phase was strongly coupled to a specific area of responsibility. Prototypes for interface were made and used as a basis for the resulting interface. The project led to a working website with good functionality. Filter was considered as important in order to ease shaping of analysis because the user could more easily sort and pick stock. The student assumed that the user would want fast and easy access to their stock so portfolio management were implemented so that user could more easily get to stock that was considered as favorites. The interface follows to a big extent <b>Jakob</b> <b>Nielsens</b> ten heuristics for User Interface Design and is proven by comparing interface with principles. The same goes for design of the system, design is proven by comparing with principles, still to this day system is considered easy to continue development. Student made the conclusion that SOLID principles were very important in order for the system to maintain its health and took experience from these principles. Student became happy with the interface but more focus could’ve been given for a more interactive interface because it might’ve been perceived as more intuitive...|$|R
