Pillows and blankets are available on longer flights.|$|E

5|$|Combat {{behavior}} {{between males}} {{has been reported}} {{on a number of}} occasions, and is very similar in form to that seen in many other viperid species.

5|$|It {{is unknown}} if Majungasaurus {{actively}} hunted {{their own kind}} or only scavenged their carcasses. However, some researchers have noted that modern Komodo monitors sometimes kill each other when competing <b>for</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> carcasses. The lizards will then proceed to cannibalize the remains of their rivals, which may suggest similar behavior in Majungasaurus and other theropods.|$|E

5|$|At Ditmas Avenue, the Culver Ramp {{ends and}} the {{underground}} line becomes elevated. This is a three-track Dual Contracts elevated on the former BMT line over McDonald (formerly Gravesend) Avenue. Just before the station, the southbound local track merges into the southbound express track, while the northbound express track becomes the El's bidirectional center express track. During the 1990s and 2000s, the center express track in this section was occasionally used for non-revenue testing. After Avenue X station, a ramp diverges to the surface <b>for</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the Culver Yard of the Coney Island Yards complex. At this point the Culver Line narrows to a two-track structure bearing one more station–Neptune Avenue–before curving into West Eighth Street–New York Aquarium station on Coney Island.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the afternoon, nearly 300armed men had {{converged on}} the lawn of the State Capitol. Brooks' men seized the state arsenal and began turning the Statehouse into an armed camp. Telegrams covered in {{signatures}} were sent to President Ulysses S. Grant supporting Brooks as the legal governor. Three out of the five Supreme Court justices also telegraphed the President in support of Brooks. Brooks telegraphed the President himself asking <b>for</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> weapons housed at the federal arsenal. He also issued a statement to the press proclaiming himself governor. The senators from the state, Clayton and Steven Dorsey, met with President Grant, and they sent a message to Brooks giving their support.|$|E

5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, males compete <b>for</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> females. Such competition {{can take the}} form of fighting other males or of herding females to prevent access by other males. In Shark Bay, male bottlenose dolphins have been observed working in pairs or larger groups to follow and/or restrict the movement of a female for weeks at a time, waiting for her to become sexually receptive. These coalitions, also known as male reproductive alliances, will fight with other coalitions for control of females.|$|E
5|$|During the rut, males {{establish}} territories, {{ranging from}} , which they mark by urinating and depositing large piles of dung. Males in neighbouring territories frequently fight <b>for</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> females, {{which they do}} by twisting and levering {{at each other with}} their horns, interspersed with stabbing attacks. Females roam the territories of different males. Outside of the rut, mixed-sex herds can range from as few as three to as many as 180 individuals, while all-male bachelor herds are of typically no more than 50 individuals. Harem and nursery herds are much smaller, typically including no more than 10 individuals.|$|E
5|$|In {{competitive}} inhibition, {{the substrate}} and inhibitor cannot bind to the enzyme {{at the same}} time, {{as shown in the}} figure on the right. This usually results from the inhibitor having an affinity for the active site of an enzyme where the substrate also binds; the substrate and inhibitor compete <b>for</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the enzyme's active site. This type of inhibition can be overcome by sufficiently high concentrations of substrate (Vmax remains constant), i.e., by out-competing the inhibitor. However, the apparent Km will increase as it takes a higher concentration of the substrate to reach the Km point, or half the Vmax. Competitive inhibitors are often similar in structure to the real substrate (see examples below).|$|E

5|$|In {{parallel}} with the second investigation, a case was being prepared against Det Ch Supt Melvin and Det Insp Dingle. In July 1992 Melvin was charged with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and Dingle with conspiracy. In 1994 their lawyers applied <b>for</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> information from Nove's inquiry, {{on the grounds that}} it might help their clients; anything that implicated Winston Silcott would support the detectives' contention that their interview notes were genuine and that Silcott really had, in effect, confessed. The lawyers also argued that the detectives should not be prosecuted until all related criminal proceedings had concluded.|$|E
5|$|Kouao {{herself was}} called to the inquiry, {{becoming}} the first convicted murderer to appear in person in a public inquiry. She initially refused to answer questions, and when she did, protested her innocence, first in French, then, raising her voice in anger, in English. Giving evidence by video link from prison, Manning apologised for his actions and {{said that it was}} not the fault of the various agencies that Climbié died. Broadcasters applied <b>for</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> this video, but Laming refused the application. Climbié's parents gave evidence and were present at most of the hearings, becoming distressed when hearing of Climbié's plight and seeing pictures of her injuries. They blamed Haringey council and its chief executive for Climbié's death.|$|E
5|$|Modern use of AAC {{began in}} the 1950s with systems {{for those who had}} lost the ability to speak {{following}} surgical procedures. During the 1960s and 1970s, spurred by an increasing commitment in the West towards the inclusion of disabled individuals in mainstream society and developing the skills required for independence, the use of manual sign language and then graphic symbol communication grew greatly. It was not until the 1980s that AAC began to emerge as a field in its own right. Rapid progress in technology, including microcomputers and speech synthesis, have paved the way for communication devices with speech output and multiple options <b>for</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> communication for those with physical disabilities.|$|E

5|$|Petersham Gate {{served the}} Russell School, {{replacing}} the more ornate gates to Petersham Lodge. A disused carriage gate further {{up the hill}} was probably a tradesman's entrance to the school or to the Lodge stables. Bishop's Gate in Chisholm Road, previously known as the Cattle Gate, was for use by livestock allowed to pasture in the nineteenth century. It was opened for public use in 1896. Kitchen Garden Gate, hidden behind Teck Plantation, is probably a nineteenth-century gate. It has never been open to the public. Cambrian Gate or Cambrian Road Gate was constructed during World War I <b>for</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the newly built South Africa Military Hospital. When the hospital was demolished in 1925, the entrance was made permanent and public as a pedestrian gate.|$|E

Following this, Prime Television New Zealand began to take on branding and programming {{similar to that of the}} Nine Network. In November 2005, Prime Television New Zealand was purchased by subscription television provider SKY Network Television for $NZ30 million, completed after approval by New Zealand's Commerce Commission in February 2006.|$|E

Following a spell of unemployment, he joined the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) in June 1940, and undertook basic training in Gombong near Yogyakarta. With the Netherlands under German occupation and the Japanese pressing <b>for</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> Indonesian oil supplies, the Dutch had opened up the KNIL to large intakes of previously excluded Javanese. Suharto was assigned to Battalion XIII at Rampal, graduated from a short training course at KNIL Kaderschool in Gombong to become a sergeant, and was posted to a KNIL reserve battalion in Cisarua.|$|E
