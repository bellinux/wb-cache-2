50|$|The {{fact that}} an {{invention}} is patentable or even patented {{does not necessarily mean}} that use of the invention would not also infringe another patent. The first patent in a given area might include a broad claim covering a <b>general</b> <b>inventive</b> <b>concept</b> if there is at that point no relevant prior art. Later, a specific implementation of that concept might be patentable if it is not disclosed in the earlier patent (or any intervening prior art), but nevertheless still falls within the scope of the earlier claim (covering the general concept). The later inventor must, therefore, obtain a license from the earlier inventor to be able to exploit their invention. At the same time, the earlier inventor might want to obtain a license from the later inventor, particularly if the later invention represents a significant improvement in the implementation of the original broad concept. In this case, the two enter into a cross license.|$|E
40|$|Unity of Invention is one {{of those}} {{requirements}} of the EPC which are sometimes difficult to grasp. In this article an attempt is made to explain the unity reasoning applied by the EPO by using examples from daily life. Three types of reasoning (a quick approach, the single <b>general</b> <b>inventive</b> <b>concept</b> approach and the special technical features approach) are discussed. The procedural steps in relation to non-unity at the search and examination stages are also described.

40|$|Complex Applications {{are often}} {{difficult}} for patent examiners to search comprehensively due to problems relating to Articles 83 and 84 of the EPC. Non-Unity occurs {{when there is}} no single <b>general</b> <b>inventive</b> <b>concept</b> in an application (Article 82, EPC). But what does an examiner do when his application contains both? This article explores the particular problems and possible solutions when an application is both complex and lacking unity, and also notes that the streamlined EPO procedure can deal with these more effectively.

50|$|Since the Alice decision, the Federal Circuit and {{district}} courts have held {{a number of}} business-method patents to be patent ineligible as mere abstract ideas implemented in a conventional way without embodying any <b>inventive</b> <b>concept.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Even {{though a}} {{phenomenon}} of nature or mathematical formula may be well known, an inventive application of the principle may be patented.

5000|$|Judge Dyk {{wrote that}} “a problem with Mayo {{insofar as it}} concludes that <b>inventive</b> <b>concept</b> cannot come from {{discovering}} something new in nature,” especially in biological sciences, is undesirable. But he insisted that [...] "any further guidance must come from the Supreme Court, not this court.” ...|$|R
25|$|Several years later, in Alice v. CLS Bank, the Supreme Court readdressed {{the patent}} {{eligibility}} {{of a business}} method. It held patent ineligible a method of securing intermediated settlement—a form of electronic escrow. In invalidating Alice's patent, the Court announced a two-step test based on the Court's earlier decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Funk Bros. Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co. This test first determines whether the claimed invention is directed to an abstract idea, law of nature, mathematical formula, or similar abstraction, If it is, the court is to proceed to the second step—determining whether the way the claimed invention implements the abstraction contains an <b>inventive</b> <b>concept,</b> as contrasted with being routine and conventional. Under the Alice test, the claimed invention is patent eligible only if it contains an <b>inventive</b> <b>concept.</b>|$|R
50|$|Reyna added:Claims {{that fail}} to recite how a desired goal is {{accomplished}} do not recite an <b>inventive</b> <b>concept.</b> For example, limitations on the context—as opposed to the manner—of accomplishing a desired result is typically not inventive, even if that context is novel. The Pythagorean Theorem cannot be made eligible by confining its use to existing surveying techniques.|$|R
50|$|The {{generic drug}} {{manufacturers}} {{also sought to}} have the patent declared invalid {{on the grounds that}} the NIH researchers who did the human cell screening were not identified in the patent as co-inventors. Justice Binnie concluded that, to be considered a co-inventor, a person must have participated in the <b>inventive</b> <b>concept</b> and not merely its verification.|$|R
5000|$|Under , a European patent {{application}} must [...] "...relate to one invention only or {{to a group}} of inventions so linked as to form a single <b>general</b> <b>inventive</b> concept." [...] This legal provision is the application, within the European Patent Convention, of the requirement of unity of invention, which applies also in many other jurisdictions.|$|R
5000|$|A second {{basis for}} an “extended {{exhaustion}} doctrine” might exist if the overall device and its individual components {{are protected by}} different patents (as here), but only when the <b>inventive</b> <b>concept</b> of the two patents is the same and is substantially embodied in the component. But that was not true here, {{as it was in}} the Quanta case. This is the point of possible similarity to Quanta, but it is entirely in the form of obiter dicta, ...|$|R
50|$|In my view, Mayo did {{not fully}} {{take into account the}} fact that an <b>inventive</b> <b>concept</b> can come not just from creative, {{unconventional}} application of a natural law, but also from the creativity and novelty of the discovery of the law itself. This is especially true in the life sciences, where development of useful new diagnostic and therapeutic methods is driven by investigation of complex biological systems. I worry that method claims that apply newly discovered natural laws and phenomena in somewhat conventional ways are screened out by the Mayo test.|$|R
50|$|The V-weapons, {{which were}} {{developed}} earlier and saw considerable deployment, especially against London and Antwerp, trace {{back to the}} same pool of highly <b>inventive</b> armament <b>concepts.</b> Therefore, they are also included here.|$|R
2500|$|The court moderated that {{assertion}} {{by agreeing}} {{that not all}} patent applications involving formulas are patent-ineligible by saying, [...] "Yet it is equally clear that a process is not unpatentable simply because it contains a law of nature or a mathematical algorithm." [...] Patents involving formulas, laws of nature, or abstract principles are eligible for patent protection if {{the implementation of the}} principle is novel and unobvious—unlike this case, in which it was conceded that the implementation was conventional. Accordingly, in Flook's case, there was no [...] "other <b>inventive</b> <b>concept</b> in its application", and thus no eligibility for a patent.|$|R
5000|$|In its {{decision}} in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., however, the Supreme Court {{seems to have}} assumed without any discussion that its old precedents such as Lincoln Engineering (uncited in the Quanta opinion) are still in force, as least {{with regard to the}} exhaustion doctrine. In Quanta, the Court considered the sale of a patented microprocessor to [...] "exhaust" [...] not only the patent on the microprocessor but the patent on a conventional personal computer (PC) containing the microprocessor, since the PC patent had essentially the same <b>inventive</b> <b>concept</b> (or departure from the prior art) as the microprocessor patent.|$|R

5000|$|Reyna {{similarly}} {{analyzed the}} other patents. He found some claims patent ineligible because they merely claimed results or functions without describing how to accomplish them {{by using an}} <b>inventive</b> <b>concept.</b> Other claims, however, he found patent eligible because they not only described functions or goals, but they also recited specific steps or machinery to accomplish them. In this connection, he argued that [...] "software structure and process can confer eligibility," [...] so that [...] "the district court erred by dismissing the recited components on the sole basis that they are software without considering whether these architectural aspects are inventive structure or process." ...|$|R
5000|$|Under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), an {{international}} application, {{which is also}} called PCT application, [...] "shall relate to one invention only or {{to a group of}} inventions so linked as to form a single <b>general</b> <b>inventive</b> concept". If the requirement of unity of invention is not met, the International Searching Authority (i.e., the patent office in charge of carrying out the international search) [...] "is entitled to request the applicant to pay an additional search fee for each invention beyond the first which is to be searched".|$|R
5000|$|The {{court said}} that it {{rejected}} Sequenom's argument that “implies that the <b>inventive</b> <b>concept</b> lies in the discovery of cffDNA in plasma or serum.” That discovery is {{the discovery of a}} natural phenomenon. The court also rejected the argument that the patent did not preempt the entire use of cffDNA and that some uses were unpreempted. While total preemption “may signal patent ineligible subject matter,” under Parker v. Flook and other cases “the absence of complete preemption does not demonstrate patent eligibility.” The fact that once a court concludes that the claims involve only natural phenomena and “conventional” techniques, “preemption concerns are fully addressed and made moot.” ...|$|R

5000|$|If {{the breadth}} of the claim is {{sufficiently}} limited to a specific application of the new law of nature discovered by the patent applicant and actually reduced to practice, I think that the novelty of the discovery should be enough to supply the necessary <b>inventive</b> <b>concept.</b> My proposed approach would require that the claimed application be both narrow in scope and actually reduced to practice, not merely “constructively” reduced to practice by filing of a patent application replete with prophetic examples [...] [...] [...] So long as a claim is narrowly tailored to what the patent applicant has actually invented and reduced to practice, there is limited risk of undue preemption of the underlying idea.|$|R

5000|$|The {{preceding}} analysis {{may have}} been overtaken by the Supreme Court's 2014 decision in Alice v. CLS Bank. In that case the Court confirmed and extended the legal analysis of its prior decisions in Parker v. Flook and Mayo v. Prometheus to claimed inventions involving implementations of computer algorithms, methods of doing business, and other methods of organizing human activity. The form of analysis that these cases dictate is {{that the presence of}} a machine, in particular a programmed digital computer, is not enough without more to assure patent eligibility. Rather, the implementation of the underlying idea must embody an [...] "inventive concept." [...] The <b>inventive</b> <b>concept</b> must provide [...] "something extra" [...] that extends beyond the algorithm or other idea, if an otherwise patent-ineligible claim is to be saved from patent ineligibility--according to these cases and recent lower court decisions that follow in their wake.|$|R
