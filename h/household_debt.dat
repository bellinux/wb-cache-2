5|$|Iceland {{elected a}} new {{government}} in April 2013, which {{as one of their}} top priorities wanted to negotiate a debt haircut towards foreign creditors of the three failed Icelandic banks now in receivership, as part of a deal to lift the long enforced (since November 2008) capital controls. The current capital controls ban a swap/exchange of ISK denominated assets to foreign currency, and so by effect has trapped repayment of ISK denominated assets to the creditors – which in theory mean they should be interested to accept a haircut in return for getting the capital controls lifted. The Icelandic government intent somehow to route the saved money from the negotiated debt haircut for creditors into a national <b>household</b> <b>debt</b> relief fund, enabling a 20% debt relief for all household mortgages. In July 2013, Standard & Poors recommended Iceland to drop the debt relief initiative, as it would only result in increased debt for the government – making it even more difficult to lend at credit markets, and it was forecasted also to ignite high inflation along with an economic recession equal to a GDP detraction of 10%. The government has nevertheless appointed a taskforce to present proposals on how best to achieve the government's goal about implementing a combined capital control abolition and debt relief for households, with a reporting deadline in October 2013. Capital controls were eventually ended in March 2017.|$|E

The ADF and KPSS unit root test results confirmed that all the variables under study were stationary. Cointegration results allowed the acceptance of four cointegrating vectors. The ECM revealed a negative sign implying the existence of a long-run equilibrium relationship among the variables. The coefficient of the error term implied that 13. 8 % of disequilibrium due to negative and positive shocks was previously corrected in one period per quarter. This adjustment provided the model with all the signs concurring with economic theory and literature on <b>household</b> <b>debts.</b> Toda-Yamamoto causality results revealed a unidirectional relationship running from GDP, UR and ER to HHD.

While before-tax income inequality is subject to market factors (e.g., globalization, trade policy, labor policy, and international competition), after-tax income inequality can be directly affected by tax and transfer policy. U.S. income inequality is comparable to other developed nations before taxes and transfers, but is among the worst after taxes and transfers. Income inequality may contribute to slower economic growth, reduced income mobility, higher levels of <b>household</b> <b>debt,</b> and greater risk of financial crises and deflation.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to stress test the {{resilience}} of Croatian <b>households</b> with <b>debt</b> to economic shocks. The shocks not only impact a household's welfare, but also increase the probability of loan default. As a result, there is a direct link between these stress-testing exercises and financial stability risks. The authors find that very few households are at risk as a result of the shocks experienced over the past few years; new vulnerable households represent about 2 percent of all households, 6 percent of <b>households</b> with <b>debt,</b> and 2 - 3 percent of aggregate banking system assets. This suggests that household over-indebtedness in Croatia is unlikely to become a drag on aggregate economic activity and that financial stability risks remain manageable. One caveat should be noted. Some 27 - 31 percent of <b>households</b> with <b>debt,</b> representing 8 - 9 of banking system assets, are vulnerable even before being subjected to an economic shock. Since NPLs were low before the global financial crisis, it can be argued that banks knew something about some of these households that is not captured by household budget surveys. It follows that the calculations in this paper should primarily focus on the increased vulnerability of households as a result of shocks and are likely to represent an upper bound to the financial stability risks faced by Croatia on account of <b>household</b> indebtedness. <b>Debt</b> Markets,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Emerging Markets,Banks&Banking Reform,Currencies and Exchange Rates...|$|R

25|$|Italy {{has been}} hit hard by the Financial crisis of 2007–08, that {{exacerbated}} the country's structural problems. Effectively, after a strong GDP growth of 5–6% per year from the 1950s to the early 1970s, and a progressive slowdown in the 1980-90s, the country virtually stagnated in the 2000s. The political efforts to revive growth with massive government spending eventually produced a severe rise in public debt, that stood at over 135% of GDP in 2014, ranking second in the EU only after the Greek one (at 174%). For all that, the largest chunk of Italian public debt is owned by national subjects, a major difference between Italy and Greece, {{and the level of}} <b>household</b> <b>debt</b> is much lower than the OECD average.|$|E
40|$|American {{consumer}} bankruptcy {{provides for}} a Fresh Start through the dis-charge of a <b>household’s</b> <b>debt.</b> Until recently, many European countries speci-fied a No Fresh Start policy of life-long liability for debt. The policy trade-off is that while Fresh Start provides insurance across states, it drives up inter-est rates and thereby makes life-cycle smoothing more difficult. This paper quantitatively compares these bankruptcy rules using a life-cycle model with incomplete markets calibrated to the U. S. and Germany. A key innovation is that households face idiosyncratic uncertainty about their net asset holdings (expense shocks) and labor income.

We find that a household with a high DSR is {{significantly more likely to}} be turned down for credit than other households. Also, the consumption growth of likely constrained households, identified using the DSR along with the liquid-asset-to-income ratio, is significantly more sensitive to past income than that of other households, confirming the DSR's value in identifying constrained households.

25|$|From {{the late}} nineteenth century through the Great Depression, social and {{economic}} forces exerted a harmful impact on the structure of Bengal's income distribution and the ability of its agricultural sector to sustain the populace. These processes included a rapidly growing population, increasing <b>household</b> <b>debt,</b> stagnant agricultural productivity, increased social stratification, and alienation of the peasant class from their landholdings. The interaction of these left clearly defined social and economic groups mired in poverty and indebtedness, unable to cope with economic shocks or maintain their access to food beyond the near term. In 1942 and 1943, in the immediate and central context of the Second World War, the shocks Bengalis faced were numerous, complex and sometimes sudden. Millions were vulnerable to starvation.|$|E
25|$|Small landholders and sharecroppers {{were still}} {{required}} to pay rent and taxes and pay off their debts, which were characterised by usurious rates of interest. Any poor harvest thus exacted a heavy toll, given their lack of legally defined security. The accumulation of consumer debt, seasonal loans, and crisis loans began a cycle of spiraling, perpetual indebtedness. This dynamic was reinforced by laws, originally designed to alleviate usury, that restricted access to credit and discouraged or prevented the practice of using farmlands as collateral for loans. This had the unintended effect of making creditors less willing to accept farmlands as a pledge against a debt, {{and more likely to}} simply wait until their debtors were unable to repay their loans. Then it was relatively easy for the jotedars to use litigation to force debtors to sell all or part of their landholdings at a low price or forfeit them at auction. Debtors then became landless or land-poor sharecroppers and labourers, usually working the same fields they had once owned. The credit-driven slide into poverty converted farmers from smallholders into dwarfholders, and from dwarfholders into sharecroppers or agricultural labourers. The accumulation of <b>household</b> <b>debt</b> to a single, local, informal creditor (who also held power over land and sometimes grain or jute) also bound the debtor nearly inescapably to the creditor/landlord; it became nearly impossible to settle the debt after a good harvest and simply walk away. In this way, the jotedars effectively dominated and impoverished the lowest tier of economic classes in several districts of Bengal.|$|E

When housing prices fell, but the value of the mortgage debt generally did not, many homeowners found themselves in a negative equity position (underwater) on their homes, driving a significant housing payment delinquency and foreclosure problem. This caused investors to question the value of mortgage-backed securities held by financial institutions, contributing to the run on the shadow banking system.|$|E
