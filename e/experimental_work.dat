5|$|The first {{recorded}} <b>experimental</b> <b>work</b> related to decompression {{was conducted by}} Robert Boyle, who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of a primitive vacuum pump.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, biological research was largely a professional endeavour. Most work was still done in the natural history mode, which emphasized morphological and phylogenetic analysis over experiment-based causal explanations. However, anti-vitalist experimental physiologists and embryologists, especially in Europe, were increasingly influential. The tremendous success of experimental approaches to development, heredity, and metabolism in the 1900s and 1910s demonstrated the power of experimentation in biology. In the following decades, <b>experimental</b> <b>work</b> replaced natural history as the dominant mode of research.|$|E
5|$|B1 {{remained}} at Portsmouth for local defence and training duties through 1916 before being paid off. B3 and B4 {{were transferred to}} Ardrossan {{by the end of}} 1915 to relieve two even more obsolescent A-class boats on local defence duties in the Firth of Clyde. B3 was transferred to Leith during mid-1916 where she was fitted with an experimental hull-mounted directional hydrophone system and later sent to Rosyth in 1917 where she was used as either a target to train anti-submarine forces or <b>experimental</b> <b>work</b> {{for the rest of the}} war. B4 was paid off before the end of 1916. B5 moved to Portsmouth during 1915 where she too was paid off before the end of 1916.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Gočeva {{released}} the album Makedonsko Devojče {{in collaboration with}} Macedonian composer Zlatko Origjanski. The album features elements of Macedonian traditional music and it represented {{a change in the}} musical style for the singer. According to Gočeva, the album served as an <b>experimental</b> <b>work</b> for her in order to establish whether {{she would be able to}} successfully record folk music. Makedonsko Devojče turned out to be a commercial and critical success, becoming the best-selling album in Macedonia in the year of its release and receiving the award for Best World Music Album at the 2008 Sunčane Skale festival in Montenegro. Its popularity among the Macedonian public lasted for several years after its release.|$|E

5|$|In September 1941, Allison {{joined the}} S-1 Section, which coordinated the early {{investigations}} into the feasibility of an atomic bomb. He began building a reactor in the squash courts under the disused stands of Stagg Field. He became head of the Metallurgical Laboratory's chemistry section in January 1942, and in March, his small experimental reactor using beryllium came closer to criticality than the graphite-moderated design of Enrico Fermi's group at Columbia University. During 1942, Compton brought all the research groups working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design at Columbia University, Princeton University and the University of California together at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Allison was placed {{in charge of the}} <b>experimental</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Fairey Spearfish was a British carrier-based, single-engined, torpedo bomber/dive bomber {{that was}} ordered from Fairey Aviation for the Fleet Air Arm during World War II. Designed during the war, the {{prototype}} did not fly until July 1945. Much larger than earlier naval bombers, {{it was designed}} for use aboard the large s that were cancelled {{after the war and}} was itself cancelled thereafter. Seven prototypes were ordered, but only five were built, of which four actually flew. They were mostly used for <b>experimental</b> <b>work</b> until the last aircraft was scrapped in 1952.|$|E
5|$|When <b>experimental</b> <b>work</b> wound down, Agnew was {{transferred}} to Project Alberta, working as part of Luis W. Alvarez's group, whose role was to monitor the yield of nuclear explosions. With Alvarez and Lawrence H. Johnston, Agnew had devised a method for measuring the yield of the nuclear blast by dropping pressure gauges on parachutes and telemetering the readings back to the plane. In June 1945, he was issued with an Army uniform and dog tags at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, and was flown to Tinian in the Western Pacific in a C-54 of the 509th Composite Group. Agnew's first task was to install his yield measurement instrumentation in the Boeing B-29 Superfortress aircraft The Great Artiste.|$|E

5|$|White's {{ability to}} attract new writers {{suffered}} because of the low rates he paid: one cent per word, as compared to three or five cents per word at the leading competitive magazines. To compensate, White cultivated new writers whose <b>experimental</b> <b>work</b> was not selling elsewhere. White made a deal in 1971 with Gordon Eklund, who was hesitating to become a full-time writer because of the financial risks. White agreed to buy anything Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed {{it was a good}} story. The result was that much of Eklund's fiction appeared in Amazing and Fantastic over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|Further {{significant}} developments did {{not come}} until the Renaissance. Vesalius discussed the cerebellum briefly, and the anatomy was described more thoroughly by Thomas Willis in 1664. More anatomical work was done during the 18th century, {{but it was not}} until early in the 19th century that the first insights into the function of the cerebellum were obtained. Luigi Rolando in 1809 established the key finding that damage to the cerebellum results in motor disturbances. Jean Pierre Flourens in the first half of the 19th century carried out detailed <b>experimental</b> <b>work,</b> which revealed that animals with cerebellar damage can still move, but with a loss of coordination (strange movements, awkward gait, and muscular weakness), and that recovery after the lesion can be nearly complete unless the lesion is very extensive. By the beginning of the 20th century, it was widely accepted that the primary function of the cerebellum relates to motor control; the first half of the 20th century produced several detailed descriptions of the clinical symptoms associated with cerebellar disease in humans.|$|E
5|$|Rents {{were set}} {{based on the}} income of the occupant. Transient {{visitors}} to Los Alamos were accommodated in the Fuller Lodge, the Guest Cottage or the Big House, which had once {{been part of the}} Los Alamos Ranch School. A school was established in 1943, catering for both grade school and high school, and 140 children were enrolled; 350 by 1946. Education was free, as was a nursery school for working mothers. With 18 grade-school teachers, 13 high-school teachers, and a superintendent, it enjoyed an excellent teacher:pupil ratio. Numerous technical buildings were constructed. Most were of a semi-permanent type, using gypsum board. They were heated from a central heating plant. Initially this was Boiler House No. 1, which had two coal-fired boilers. This was replaced by Boiler House No. 2, which had six oil-fired boilers. In addition to the main site at Los Alamos, some 25 outlying sites were developed for <b>experimental</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
