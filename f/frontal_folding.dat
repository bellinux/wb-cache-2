40|$|Abstract [...] In {{order to}} {{understand}} interactions between motion along thrusts and the associated style of deformation and strain distribution in their hangingwalts, geologic mapping and strain measurements were conducted in an excellently exposed thrust-related fold system in the Lewis thrust plate, northwestern Montana. This system consists of: (1) an E-directed basal thrust (the Gunsight thrust) that has a fiat-ramp geometry and a slip of about 3. 6 km; (2) an E-verging asymmetric anticline with its nearly vertical forelimb truncated by the basal thrust from below; (3) a 4 -km wide <b>fold</b> belt, the <b>frontal</b> <b>fold</b> complex, that lies {{directly in front of}} the E-verging anticline; (4) a W-directed bedding-parallel fault (the Mount Thompson fault) that bounds the top of the <b>frontal</b> <b>fold</b> belt and separates it from the undeformed tobroadly folded strata bove; and (5) regionally developed, W-dipping spaced cleavage. Although the overall geometry of the thrust-related fold system differs from any previously documented fault-related folds, the E-verging anticline itself resembles geometrically a Rich-type fault-bend fold. The observed initial cut-off and fold interlimb angles of this anticline, however, cannot be explained by cross-section balancing models for the development of either a fault-bend fold or a fault-propagation fold. Possible origins for the E-verging anticline include (1) the fold initiated as an open fault-bend fold and tightened only later during its emplacement along the basal thrust and (2) the fold started as either a fault-bend or a fault-propagation fold, but simultaneous or subsequent volume change incompatible with an...|$|R

30|$|The {{consistency}} {{between the}} geomorphic rupture length and the meizoseismal {{extent of the}} 1934 earthquake (Sapkota et al., 2013) (Fig.  1) warrants a broader historical comparison between paleo-rupture extents, macroseismic source sizes, coseismic slip estimates, and likely positions of rupture termini or asperities. The homogeneous interseismic coupling along strike the Nepalese MHT (Ader et al., 2012) implies that rupture termini are chiefly controlled by long-term structural features in the footwall and hanging wall. Notably, tectonic structures in the underthrust Indian basement (Fig.  1) clearly impact both the <b>frontal</b> <b>fold</b> geometry and Lesser Himalayan exhumation (Bollinger et al., 2004 a; Gahalaut and Kundu, 2012; Godin and Harris, 2014).

Moreover, we provide field evidence that NW–SE fault zones oblique to the structural grain of the belt probably acted as transfer fault zones during the the Quaternary fold-thrust emplacement. Two successive Quaternary stress regimes are evidenced in southwestern Taiwan: A NW–SE compression, followed by a recent nearly E–W compression. The latter shows an along-strike change from pure E–W contraction to the north to perpendicular N–S extension in the south.

30|$|Direct {{observations}} of geological structures on an overriding plate {{are important because}} forearc slope deformation is related to large earthquakes and tsunami generation. The convergent margin along the Sumatran subduction zone, where the Mw 9.3 Sumatra–Andaman Earthquake and related tsunami occurred in 2004, is characterized by thick sediments and prominent deformation {{in the form of}} large-scale <b>frontal</b> <b>folds</b> in the accretionary prism (Sibuet et al. 2007). The distance from the trench axis to the arc in northern Sumatra is approximately 250  km, and the forearc Aceh Basin is located sub-parallel to the trench axis. The boundary between the Aceh Basin and the forearc region is marked by the West Andaman Fault, which has a flower structure, indicating strike-slip deformation on the landward side of the forearc high (e.g., Seeber et al. 2007). Numerous anticlinal ridges oriented sub-parallel to the trench have been found from the trench slope to forearc high by seismic reflection surveys (Misawa et al. 2014). Another example of a convergent margin is that of the Tohoku area along the Japan Trench, where the Mw 9.0 Great East Japan Earthquake and related tsunami occurred in 2011. Here, the upper forearc slope has a relatively flat seafloor topography that is inclined at <[*] 3 °, and recent tectonic deformation has been characterized by extensional subsidence and normal faulting within a series of small basins on the slope down to a water depth of ∼[*] 3000 m (Arai et al. 2014; Boston et al. 2017), which reveal extensional deformation related to the development of numerous normal faults sub-parallel to the trench axis.|$|R
40|$|We {{established}} a stress-history-dependent porosity model of potential target rocks for CO 2 geosequestration based on rock sample porosity measurements under various effective stresses (5 - 120 MPa). The measured {{samples were collected}} from shallow boreholes (< 300 m depth) drilled at the <b>frontal</b> <b>fold</b> in northern Taiwan. The lithology, density, and the stress-history-dependent porosity derived from shallow boreholes enabled us to predict the porosity-depth relationship of given rock formations at (burial depths of approximately 3170 - 3470 m) potential sites for CO 2 geosequestration located near the Taoyuan Tableland coastline. Our {{results indicate that the}} porosity of samples derived from laboratory tests under atmospheric pressure is significantly greater than the porosity measured under stress caused by sediment burial. It is therefore strongly recommended that CO 2 storage capacity assessment not be estimated from the porosity measured under atmospheric pressure. Neglecting the stress history effect on the porosity of compacted and uplifted rocks may induce a percentage error of 7. 7 % at a depth of approximately 1000 m, where the thickness of the eroded, formerly overlying formation is 2. 5 km in a synthetic case. The CO 2 injection pressure effect on the porosity was also evaluated using the stress-history-dependent porosity model. As expected, the pore pressure buildup during CO 2 injection will induce an increase in the rock porosity. For example, a large injection pressure of 13 MPa at a depth of approximately 1000 m will increase the rock porosity by a percentage error of 6. 7 %. Our results have implications for CO 2 storage capacity injection pressure estimates...|$|R

40|$|New {{structural}} data, available seismicity data {{together with}} mechanical {{constraints on the}} Eurasian continental lithosphere and reconstruction of paleostress trajectories are combined in order to re-assess and discuss the dominant deformation mode (thin-skinned vs thick-skinned) in the Western fold-and-thrust belt of the active Taiwan collision zone. Serial balanced cross-sections and computed paleostress tensors suggest that structural styles and stress trajectories {{at the front of}} the Taiwan mountain belt may vary rapidly along-strike depending on the presence of pre-orogenic Paleogene troughs in the Chinese continental margin (Taihsi and Tainan basins) that are favourably oriented to be reactivated and in-verted. In localities of the western foreland, where basin inversion and thick-skinned basement-involved shortening predominate, the crustal seismic activity is important and characterized by strike-slip faulting. In these domains of the foldethrust belt, the stress deviations with respect to the regional transport direction are also important. By contrast, in domains of significant syn-orogenic subsidence, a thin-skinned style of deformation may be prominent due to the lack of available pre-existing features. The seismic activity is limited to few major faulted boundaries such as the active ChelungpueSani thrust, and the stress deviations are limited. The timing of deformation at the belt front seems to be inde-pendent of the structural styles, so that <b>frontal</b> <b>folds</b> are active since probably 0. 5 Ma. However, in inner parts of the Western Foothills of Taiwan, where superimposed thick-skinned and thin-skinned deformation are required, out-of-sequence thrusting occurs to maintain the topographic pro-file. Finally, we suggest that kinematics and structural styles of the western foldethrust belt are controlled by the mechanics of the Eurasian continental margin in agreement with a recent study. At the scale of the orogen, the limited shortening amounts across the WF and in the Central Range as well as the absence of continental HP-rocks better support a thick-skinned collision model for Taiwan...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The Sulaiman {{foldbelt}} is {{an active}} and conspicuous tectonic feature on the northwestern margin of the Indo-Pakistani plate. Seismic reflection data have been combined with surface geological mapping and drillhole data to interpret the structural style and tectonic shortening of the eastern Sulaiman foldbelt and its adjacent foredeep. The data show that the basement is more than 8 km deep near the deformation front and that it deepens towards the west. The foredeep adjacent to the eastern Sulaiman foldbelt is a broad synclinal structure, with a steep western limb; the more gentle eastern limb has monoclinal dips from near zero to 2. 5 °. Several salt-cored anticlines are observed on {{the eastern part of}} the monocline, but the salt structures are lacking in the western foredeep and in the frontal part of the Sulaiman foldbelt. The basal decollement under the Sulaiman lobe lies either in ductile Eocambrian salt, or within a deep zone of other material that undergoes ductile behavior. Near the deformation front, ramps from the basal detachment become flats in lower Triassic and lower Cretaceous shales. A steep and highly elevated zone immediately to the west of <b>frontal</b> <b>folds</b> is interpreted to be underlain by a passive-roof duplex. The culmination wall of this oblique duplex is separated from the overlying roof sequence by a passive-roof thrust in lower Cretaceous shales. The roof-thrust has a back-thrust sense of movement, relative to the forelandward propagating duplex, and may extend obliquely 100 km into the interior of the foldbelt. Fault-propagation and fault-bend folds are present in the frontal portion of the eastern Sulaiman foldbelt. Palinspastic restoration of a balanced cross-section shows 108 km of shortening in the eastern Sulaiman foldbelt east of the Kingri strike-slip fault. The presence of more than 11 km of pre-Neogene strata on top of basement suggests that the Mesozoic rifted margin of the Indian subcontinent may lie beneath the Sulaiman foldbelt. This interpretation is also favored by the presence of ophiolites and flysch deposits overthrusted on late Cretaceous shelf strata...|$|R
40|$|The downstructure {{of viewing}} {{geologic}} maps, balanced and cross sections, and hanging-wall-sequence diagrams {{are applied to}} produce the first comprehensive synthesis of the structure below the willard thrust sheet. Development of the duplex beneath the Willard thrust may be explained with a 2 ̆ 2 piggyback 2 ̆ 2 thrust model where younger thrust slices form below and fold an older, overlying thrust sheet. Progressive failure of the footwall ramp of the Willard thrust sheet extended the sole thrust eastward and produced a duplex consisting of thrust slices (horses) which adhered to the overriding thrust sheet where it ramped from a lower sole thrust to an upper decollement horizon. The resulting structural culmination produced a distinct antiform in the Willard thrust sheet. The duplex is here named the Ogden duplex. <b>Frontal</b> <b>folds</b> (formed at ramps perpendicular to transport) and lateral folds (formed at ramps parallel to transport) mark the margin of Individual horses within the duplex. Folded thrusts, thrust-splay relationships, and lateral overlap of horses help determine the sequence of thrusting.

This is a comprehensive study of the geochemistry, petrography, and structural relations of veins and host rocks from the Nuncios Fold Complex, the west-plunging, <b>frontal</b> <b>fold</b> complex of the Sierra Madre Oriental exposed in the Monterrey Salient near Saltillo, Mexico. Oxygen, carbon, and strontium isotope variations in vein-filling calcite and quartz and their host rocks are used to elucidate the origin, spatial, and temporal evolution and migration pathways of fluids in the evaporite-detached Nuncios Fold Complex. The folded Mesozoic sedimentary sequence contains two regional paleohydrostratigraphic units separated by a unit of low permeability. The lower paleohydrostratigraphic unit is comprised of the Zuloaga and La Casita Formations. The unit directly overlies the lower detachment of Minas Viejas evaporite and lies beneath the low-permeability rocks of the Taraises shale. The upper paleohydrostratigraphic unit is comprised of the Taraises, Cupido, La Pena, and Aurora Formations. That unit is confined beneath the Parras shale, which also constituted the regional upper detachment in the Monterrey salient. Two main generations of cements are present in both regional paleohydrostratigraphic units. Early vein-filling cements have delta 18 O, delta 13 C, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, and fluid inclusion temperatures that are distinct between the lower and upper units. This suggests, along with a strong correspondence between early cement and host-rock delta 18 O and delta 13 C values, that early diagenetic fluids were compartmentalized between the lower and upper units. Late vein-filling cements have isotopic compositions and fluid inclusion temperatures that converge to similar values, indicating open fluid flow between the lower and upper units. Overall, {{the results of this study}} suggest that the fluid history of the Nuncios Fold Complex evolved in two main stages: (1) burial diagenesis and early folding, during which fluids were confined within individual units; (2) late stage folding, during which increased deformation associated with fold tightening caused the expulsion of fluids from the lower unit into the upper unit. During the latter stage, the fold hinge evolved as a distinct structural and geochemical environment where hydrocarbons and other fluids accumulated and interacted...|$|R
40|$|The {{pattern of}} fluvial {{incision}} across the Himalayas of central Nepal is estimated from {{the distribution of}} Holocene and Pleistocene terraces and from the geometry of modern channels along major rivers draining across the range. The terraces provide good constraints on incision rates across the Himalayan <b>frontal</b> <b>folds</b> (Sub-Himalaya or Siwaliks Hills) where rivers are forced to cut down into rising anticlines and have abandoned numerous strath terraces. Farther north and upstream, in the Lesser Himalaya, prominent fill terraces were deposited, probably during the late Pleistocene, and were subsequently incised. The amount of bedrock incision beneath the fill deposits is generally small, suggesting a slow rate of fluvial incision in the Lesser Himalaya. The terrace record is lost in the high range where the rivers are cutting steep gorges. To complement the terrace study, fluvial incision was also estimated from the modern channel geometries using {{an estimate of the}} shear stress exerted by the flowing water {{at the bottom of the}} channel as a proxy for river incision rate. This approach allows quantification of the effect of variations in channel slope, width, and discharge on the incision rate of a river; the determination of incision rates requires an additional lithological calibration. The two approaches are shown to yield consistent results when applied to the same reach or if incision profiles along nearby parallel reaches are compared. In the Sub-Himalaya, river incision is rapid, with values up to 10 – 15 mm/yr. It does not exceed a few millimeters per year in the Lesser Himalaya, and rises abruptly at the front of the high range to reach values of ∼ 4 – 8 mm/yr within a 50 -km-wide zone that coincides with the position of the highest Himalayan peaks. Sediment yield derived from the measurement of suspended load in Himalayan rivers suggests that fluvial incision drives hillslope denudation of the landscape at the scale of the whole range. The observed pattern of erosion is found to closely mimic uplift as predicted by a mechanical model taking into account erosion and slip along the flat-ramp-flat geometry of the Main Himalayan Thrust fault. The morphology of the range reflects a dynamic equilibrium between present-day tectonics and surface processes. The sharp relief together with the high uplift rates in the Higher Himalaya reflects thrusting over the midcrustal ramp rather than the isostatic response to reincision of the Tibetan Plateau driven by late Cenozoic climate change, or late Miocene reactivation of the Main Central Thrust...|$|R

40|$|The 100 km long <b>frontal</b> {{foreland}} <b>fold</b> — the Janauri anticline in NW Himalayan foothills {{represents a}} single segment formed due to inter-linking {{of the southern}} (JS 1) and the northern (JS 2) Janauri segments. This anticline {{is a product of}} the fault related fold growth that facilitated lateral propagation by acquiring more length and linkage of smaller segments giving rise to a single large segment. The linked portion marked by flat-uplifted surface in the central portion represents the paleo-water gap of the Sutlej River. This area is comparatively more active in terms of tectonic activity, well justified by the occurrence of fault scarps along the forelimb and backlimb of the anticline. Occurrence of active fault scarps on either side of the anticline suggests that the slip accommodated in the frontal part is partitioned between the main frontal thrust i. e. the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT) and associated back-thrust. The uplift in the piedmont zone along southern portion of Janauri anticline marked by dissected younger hill range suggests fore-landward propagation of tectonic activity along newly developed Frontal Piedmont Thrust (FPT), an imbricated emergent thrust branching out from the HFT system. We suggests that this happened because the southern segment JS 1 does not linked-up with the northwestern end of Chandigarh anticline segment (CS). In the northwestern end of the Janauri anticline, due to no structural asperity the tectonic activity on HFT was taken-up by two (HF 1 — in the frontal part and HF 2 — towards the hinterland side) newly developed parallel active faults (Hajipur Fault) branched from the main JS 2 segment. The lateral propagation and movements along HF 1 and HF 2 resulted in uplift of the floodplain as well as responsible for the northward shift of the Beas River.

40|$|Although the Main Himalayan Frontal Thrust (MHT/MFT), {{largest and}} fastest {{slipping}} continental megathrust, poses {{a major threat}} to the northern Indian sub continent, seismic hazard along it remains to be quantified. Based on historical descriptions of the two main 20 th century earthquakes (1905, 1934), a consensus has emerged that neither produced surface ruptures, a view recently reinforced by paleo seismological investigations in which only faulting much older than 1900 was found. This leaves us with fundamental, unanswered questions (recurrence times, rupture lengths, geomorphic signature of large events), and the ominous perspective of even greater quakes with displacements in excess of 15 m, potentially on par with M 9 oceanic subduction events. Knowing the precise geometry and history of earthquake ruptures along this very active fault is thus more than ever critical to assess seismic hazard in the area. To address such questions we have engaged high resolution geomorphic and paleo seismic studies of Main Frontal Thrust (MFT) in eastern Nepal. Long wavelength warping of river terraces show that late Pleistocene/Holocene deformation is well expressed across <b>frontal</b> <b>folds</b> above the thrust, which have been successfully used to determine a shortening rate on order of 2 cm/yr, but the surface trace of the MFT, where sharpest, remains the best location to document whether large earthquakes break the ground and to determine their sizes and recurrence times. Our survey of the area between the Mahara Khola and Arun/Sun Khosi valleys shows many clear outcrops with young, pristine scarps, challenging the consensus that no surface rupture took place in the 19 th century. This area is also located at the centre of the region comprised entirely within the 1934 isoseismal VIII. In the valley of the Sir Khola, which crosses the northern branch of the MFT, we logged in detail a refreshed river cut face across the 26 m high cumulative thrust scarp. Newly dated charcoal samples collected in the gravel layers of an uplifted strath terrace offset by thrusts reaching the surface confirm the young age of the last event. Six distinct 14 C calibrated dates indicate that the terrace was emplaced less than 250 years ago, in the 18 th or early 19 thcentury, and was subsequently offset by F 1, with a vertical throw of 1. 5 m (3 m of slip). This same terrace is offset again by another fault {{at the base of the}} main scarp. Since no other large earthquake than the Bihar Nepal event was recorded locally in the 19 th and 20 th century, it must be concluded that the Sir Khola rivercut exposes the first unambiguous surface trace ever found of the 1934 earthquake. Similarly, a trench excavated 30 m east of the Natural river cut shows two events approximately 700 years apart. We thus interpret the great 1934 earthquake to be a repeat of the 1255 AD event that destroyed Kathmandu. Other charcoal ages in lower fluvial units of the footwall rapidly jump to 3000 years BP, and to older ages just below (up to 7000 yrs), nearly at the same level as that of the present river. This implies that stratigraphic section is missing, but also that there has been no significant longterm incision by the river just south of the thrust. In the Charnath Khola area, the dating of different uplifted terraces on the MFT hanging wall, and of one on the footwall, supports our findings at the Sirkhola and Ratu Nadi. Here, the 14 16 m high Tintale terrace, whose age is only 1 1. 25 kyr, appears to have been uplifted by at least two events (possibly three) with 4 5 m of vertical coseismic throw in each event since its abandonment. 14 C dating of the lowest hanging wall terrace (4 m high) in Tintale creek, which was abandoned less than three centuries ago supports the existence of the 1934 rupture. Geophysical surveys including three shallow seismic profiles and Electrical Resistivity Tomographic (ERT) sections, 1. 5 km long each, in the Charnath, Sirkhola and Ratu Valleys, and one Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) profile at Thapatol near Bardibas, add invaluable information at various depths, complementing our morpho tectonic interpretation of the area. In particular, the seismic profiles shot across the MFT image well the shallow part of the thrust plane down to 400 mepth. To our knowledge, at least in Nepal, this is the first effort of this kind to study the MFT at such detailed scale in combination with paleo seismological trenching. PARIS-BIUSJ-Sci.

In contrast, geophysical data indicate that the subsurface structure is more complex, exhibiting several northward- and southward-directed thrusts and folds detaching on the Pyrenean foreland Eocene evaporites. Integration of surface (geologic maps and dip measurements) and subsurface data (seismic and wells) allowed us to reconstruct the 3 D structure of this area. To produce a more robust kinematic model, we used an experimental approach to investigate the evolution of <b>frontal</b> structures in <b>folds</b> and thrust belts on evaporitic detachments. Different viscous layer configurations were tested in a series of sandbox models comparing them with the evolution of the Súria Anticline. Taking into account the deformation and that seismic quality is in general poor, the experimental results allow us to better characterize the structures developed in this area. Our structural evolution is characterized by an early stage of salt inflation and fold nucleation. With increasing shortening, the structure evolved to a detachment anticline eventually developing a northward-directed thrust that broke through the northern anticline limb. The present-day geometry developed in a later stage of fold reactivation, when a new regional fold formed, and tightened the preexisting structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is to {{determine}} the folding characteristics including geometry, interaction of the surface and subsurface geometries, kinematic evolution of the structures and timing of deformation in Pusht-e Kuh Arc in Lurestan Province of Zagros fold and thrust belt in Iran. Multidisciplinary methods have been used for different objectives in this thesis. Structural characteristic and fold geometry in two different units have been studied in the Zangul anticline. The Zangul anticline is a four closures anticline, with an open box folding shape and slightly verging to the SW. Its amplitude is of about 1. 5 km and its half wavelength is ~ 4. 5 km. The geometric construction of several cross-sections showing a regular position of the axial traces intersections indicates that the Triassic Dashtak evaporites may represent one of the major intermediate detachment levels in the sedimentary pile. The significant result is that the grouping of Asmari folds forms synforms (SE termination of the Zangul anticline) and antiforms (NW termination), which is so important for oil exploration. The Anaran anticline on top of the Mountain Front Flexure represents the most external fold of the Pusht-e Kuh Arc. This anticline is asymmetric with a long and gently dipping backlimb and a very steep forelimb. However, the most characteristic tectonic feature is the large amount of normal faults that cut the crestal and forelimb domains of the anticline. These normal faults, formed by layer-parallel extension during folding, limit a crestal graben and are not very deep. In addition to these normal faults, the potential tectonic decoupling across the intermediate Gachsaran detachment level and the lack of reflections imaging the Anaran anticline forelimb in newly acquired seismic lines preclude the understanding of the geometry of the fold at depth. We propose a geometric and evolution model for the Anaran anticline with the help of sand box models and growth strata ages. We also explore the potential effects of erosion and sedimentation coeval to folding {{in the development of the}} Anaran anticline. The characteristic geometry of the Anaran anticline is directly related to its singular position on top of the Mountain Front Flexure. However, the proposed model may be applied to other folds on top of this major basement-related thrust as for example the Siah Kuh and Khaviz anticlines in Pusht-e Kuh Arc and Dezful Embayment domains. The magnetostratigraphy dating technique applied to the syntectonic detrital sediments of the Agha Jari Formation in two locations across the Pusht-e Kuh Arc. The first location is the Afrineh syncline in the center part of the folded belt displaying field evidences of growth strata in the uppermost part of the Agha Jari Formation. The second section is located in front of the High Zagros Fault across the Chaman Goli syncline with the same stratigraphy as in Afrineh syncline. The magnetostrigraphy dating technique in this study provides with the ages of the Agha Jari units and permits to constrain the sequence of the folding associated to growth strata across this particular part of the Zagros fold belt. Both sections are showing good paleomagnetic results with sequence of normal and reverse polarity intervals. They show very good correlation to the Global Polarity Time Scale. The correlation to the GPTS shows the base of the growth in Afrineh syncline dated at about 11. 8 Ma. The onlap geometry in Afrineh syncline is indication of deformation pulse associated to the folding. This phase of folding is about 5. 4 ± 0. 5 Ma earlier than folding in the front of the Pusht-e Kuh Arc. The correlation of the magnetic polarity sequence to the GPTS shows age of ~ 13. 9 Ma in Afrineh and ~ 17. 2 Ma in Chaman Goli synclines for the base of the Agha Jari Formation. It shows that both Agha Jari and Bakhtyari prograde from hinterland to foreland in agreement to other foreland basin in the World. The age of the folding becomes younger towards the foreland and therefore implying a foreland ward sequence of deformation that started at about 20 Ma in hinterland, reached the <b>frontal</b> <b>folds</b> at about 7. 6 Ma and continued to about 2. 5 - 1. 5 Ma. El Zagros representa la culminación de la colisión continental entre las placas tectónicas de Arabia y Euroasiática. Las montañas del Zagros se extienden por más de 2000 kilómetros desde Turquía hasta la parte suroccidental de Irán. Los movimientos orogénicos se iniciaron durante el Cretácico superior con el emplazamiento de unidades ofiolíticas sobre el margen de Arabia. A partir del Cretácico superior la continua convergencia entre las dos placas tectónicas produjo un acortamiento traducido en un sistema de cabalgamientos y pliegues que finalmente formó el plegamiento tal y como lo conocemos actualmente. Este plegamiento, sin embargo, ocurrió principalmente durante el Mioceno. ç La parte más externa de las montañas del Zagros presentan unos afloramientos de gran calidad que permiten estudios muy detallados de la estructura y permiten recoger muestras para datar los sedimentos sintectónicos que permitirán determinar la edad de la deformación tectónica. La datación del sistema de pliegues es muy importante para la exploración de hidrocarburos en una región en la que existen importantes reservas de petróleo y gas. Los objetivos de investigación de esta tesis doctoral son: 1) construir la geometría 3 D de una región plegada del Zagros, en concreto del anticlinal de Zangul, en donde coexisten pliegues de gran amplitud y pliegues de menor amplitud al nivel de las calizas de la formación de Asmari; 2) determinar la geometría de la parte frontal del Zagros donde coexisten el anticlinal de Anaran y el frente del Pusht-e Kuh Arc levantado por encima del "Mountain Frontal Flexure" (MFF); 3) determinar la edad de las diferentes formaciones litológicas que rellenan los sinclinales del Pusht-e Kuh Arc y así determinar la edad de la deformación y la secuencia de esta deformación. La datación de estos sedimentos sintectónicos continentales se ha realizado por medio de técnicas magnetoestratigráficas. </I...|$|R
40|$|On the Ionian Sea {{coast of}} {{southern}} Italy, spanning {{the transition from}} the Calabrian Arc to the Apennines, NE-directed motion of the thin-skinned frontal thrust belt of the Apennines toward the Apulian foreland reportedly ceased during the Early-Middle Pleistocene (PATACCA & SCANDONE, 2007). Deformation since then was dominated by the regional uplift of the Calabrian Arc (WESTAWAY, 1993; CUCCI & CINTI, 1998). However, detailed structural and geomorphologic analysis has revealed that uplift of Middle Pleistocene and younger marine terraces not only ensues from a regional-scale process, but also reflects a smaller-wavelength component of shortening which is attributed to recent, deeper activity of blind thrust and transpressional structures (FERRANTI et alii, 2009; CAPUTO et alii, 2010). Thus, shortening in this sector of the Apennines may still be ongoing although at a very slow rate and with a subdue morphological signature. The latter limitations have led to the common thinking that this sector of the Apennines is inactive. The submarine extension of the frontal thrust belt is represented by the Amendolara ridge, which stretches for over 80 km to the SE beneath the Taranto Gulf, the northern embayment of the Ionian Sea (Fig. 1, inset). Although it was suggested, based on existing multichannel seismic profile analysis, that the ridge has grown as a result of transpressional displacement (DEL BEN et alii, 2007; FERRANTI et alii, 2009), detailed images of the structural architecture as well as robust constraints on the timing of recent deformation were lacking. High-resolution marine geophysical data collected on the Amendolara ridge during the TEATIOCA_ 2011 cruise provided unequivocal constraints to assert active fault-related fold growth. Single-channel seismic (sparker) and acoustic CHIRP profiles, corroborated by multibeam mapping and shallow coring, form the novel dataset to constrain the near-bottom evolution. The new data were benchmarked to the crustal geometry by means of interpretation of existing multichannel seismic profiles. The integrated dataset analysis revealed that the NW-SE trending ridge has grown during Late Pliocene- Quaternary as a result of motion above an array of blind thrusts grouped into the Amendolara Thrust-Fold System (ATFS). Strikingly, the ATFS has displacement to the southwest toward land, and represents a backthrust belt in the regional reference frame. The stratigraphic signature of recent (Middle-Late Quaternary) fold growth is recorded by syn-tectonic depositional sequences within ponded basins and on the flanks of the ridge, and is represented by tectonicallystacked packages, and by widespread debris flows and slumping (Figs. 2, 3). Along the whole southwest margin of the ridge, the Middle-Late Quaternary depositional packages are ostensibly folded in response to southwestdirected displacement, as documented by fold asymmetry (Figs. 2, 3). Morpho-bathymetry data and seismic profiling show contrasting geometries and structural styles among the three 15 to 20 km long and right-laterally offset banks which form the top of the Amendolara Ridge (Fig. 1). These banks are floored by the folded sediments and locally by lower Pleistocene or older bedrock. Whereas the Amendolara and Rossano banks are floored by an asymmetric fold (Fig. 2) the structure of the Cariati bank is represented by a north-dipping monocline with a train of minor <b>frontal</b> <b>folds</b> (Fig. 3). Based on the different geometry and morpho-structure, we argue that the banks are the expression of as many en-echelon blind fault segments. Based on the pattern of folded reflectors, the eastern and central segments (Cariati and Rossano, respectively) display evidence of more recent activity (Fig. 3). To the north of the Amendolara bank, a NE-verging system of two anticlines (Fig. 2), which are the offshore prosecution of the Valsinni ridge on-land (one of the recent most uplifted ridge of the Southern Apennines, PATACCA & SCANDONE, 2007), fold the basal unconformity of the last glacial sequence. Appraisal of the crustal seismic reflection profiles calibrated with exploratory wells reveals that the ATFS controlled deposition of an up to 3 km thick syn-tectonic Late Pliocene-Quaternary sedimentary sequence in the Sibari and Corigliano basins, which flanks the ridge to the southwest (Fig. 1). Numeric modeling of Middle Pleistocene markers extracted from the sparker, and of older markers derived from the multichannel seismic dataset suggests that the three steep blind segments, which are the deep expression of the folded or tilted sediments in the banks, are rooted at 10 km depth into a low-angle dipping detachment ramp extending to 20 km depth. This deeper ramp is responsible for the overall NE-tilt of the ridge (Fig. 3) and development of a larger-wavelength fold involving the ridge as a whole. Documentation of active fold growth beneath the Amendolara Ridge carries important seismotectonic implications. This part of southern Italy is characterized by a low level of historical and instrumental seismicity. Indeed, the region suffered from moderate but locally damaging earthquakes caused by yet unknown or debated sources. The strongest earthquakes in the area are the 1836, April 25 (M= 6. 2), the 1917, June 12, (M= 5. 25) and the 1988, April 13 (M= 5) (data from CPTI 11, ROVIDA et alii., 2011). The 1917 and 1988 events are located offshore, and our new analysis supports the contention that they spatially coincide with the central-eastern segments of the ATFS, where the evidence of more recent activity is found (Fig. 3). On the other hand, evidences show that the 1836 event is located inland, near the northern coast of the Sila (GALLI et alii, 2010). We also investigated the tsunami occurred during the 1836 event (TINTI et alii, 2004) and the alternative hypothesis between earthquake or submarine landside. Today, the ATFS shows a moderate seismic activity expressed by Mw< 4. 7 thrust and transpressional earthquakes (Fig. 4), which apparently originate at the branching zone between shallow ramp segments and deep detachment. The incremental shortening axis resolved onto the mean strike of the ATFS indicates left-oblique to reverse motion. Based on the size of fault segments and the modeled depth of micro-seismicity, we argue that the ATFS may be capable of moderate (M 6) earthquakes. Growth of the Amendolara Ridge temporally coincides with cessation of the Southern Apennines thinskin thrust belt motion, when collision between southern Adria and Europe overwhelmed retreat of the Apulian- Ionian slab, that had dominated the structural evolution of the central Mediterranean orogen since the Oligocene. The localization of the transpressional belt was controlled by an inherited mechanical interface between the thick Apulian crust and the attenuated Ionian crust.

40|$|Sierra Blanca, {{situated}} in the SW of M&# 225;laga, forms part of the Blanca unit, belonging to the Alpujarride Complex of the Betic Cordillera. Its lithologic sequences {{are made up of}} a group of migmatites, gneisses and schists and an upper formation of marbles (white dolomitic and the bottom and blue calcareous towards the top), linked with a transitional contact. The structure of Sierra Blanca is comprised of folds, generally isoclinal, with reversed limbs and with important tectonic transpositions, the direction of which is approximately E-W in the eastern area and N-S and E-W in the West. In both areas the folds present opposing vergences, consistently towards the interior of the sierra. The origin of these structures is explained with a model of westerly movements of the Blanca unit, in relation to the Los Reales unit, with the formation of <b>frontal</b> and lateral <b>folds.</b> In its advancement, the western part of Sierra Blanca underwent an important anti-clockwise rotation responsible for the co-existence of folds in N-S and E-W directions. These structures occurred under ductile conditions, owing to the presence of important overthrusting peridotitic masses of the Los Reales unit. This model of westerly displacement is inserted in the process undergone by the Betic-Rif Internal Zones (with Blanca and Los Reales units included) which occurred {{at the end of the}} Oligocene-Early Miocene when the Gibraltar arch began to be formed. Sierra Blanca, situada al SW de M&# 225;laga, forma parte de la unidad de Blanca que pertenece al complejo Alpuj&# 225;rride de la Cordillera B&# 233;tica.

La estructura de Sierra Blanca est&# 225; formada por pliegues, generalmente isoclinales, con flancos invertidos que muestran importantes evidencias de estiramiento tect&# 243;nico. Estos pliegues tienen una direcci&# 243;n aproximada E-W en el sector oriental y N-S y E-W en el occidental. En los bordes de ambos sectores los pliegues muestran vergencias opuestas, siempre hacia el interior de la sierra. El origen de esta estructura se explica con un modelo que considera un desplazamiento hacia el oeste de la unidad de Blanca, con respecto a la de Los Reales, form&# 225;ndose pliegues en posici&# 243;n frontal y lateral.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the diagenetic history of dual (i. e. matrix and fracture) porosity reservoir lithologies in Cretaceous to Eocene carbonate turbidites of the Ionian fold and thrust belt, {{close to the}} oil-producing centre of Fier-Ballsh (central Albania). The first major diagenetic event controlling reservoir quality was early cementation by isopachous and syntaxial low-Mg calcite. These cements formed primarily around crinoid and rudist fragments, which acted as nucleation sites. In sediments in which these bioclasts are the major rock constituent, this cement can make up 30 % of the rock volume, resulting in low effective porosity. In strata in which these bioclasts are mixed with reworkedmicrite, isopachous/syntaxial cements stabilized the framework, and matrixporosity is around 15 %. The volumetric importance of these cements, their optical and luminescence character (distribution and dull orange luminescence) and stable isotopic signal (delta(18) O and delta(13) C averaging respectively; - 0. 5 parts per thousand VPDB and + 2 parts per thousand VPDB) all support a marine phreatic origin. Within these turbidites and debris flows, several generations of fractures alternated with episodes of cementation. A detailed reconstruction of this history was based on cross-cutting relationships of fractures and compactional and layer-parallel shortening (LPS) stylolites. The prefolding calcite veins possess orange cathodoluminescence {{similar to that of}} the host rock. Their stable isotope signatures (delta(18) O of - 3. 86 to - 0. 85 parts per thousand VPDB and delta(13) C of - 0. 14 to + 2. 98 parts per thousand VPDB) support a closed diagenetic rock-buffered system. A similar closed system accounts for the selectively reopened and subsequently calcite-cemented LPS stylolites (delta(18) O of - 1. 81 to - 1. 14 parts per thousand VPDB and delta(13) C of + 1. 52 to + 2. 56 parts per thousand VPDB). Within the prefolding veins, brecciated host rock fragments and complex textures such as crack and seal features resulted from hydraulic fracturing. They reflect expulsion of overpressured fluids within the footwall of the <b>frontal</b> thrusts. After <b>folding</b> and thrust sheet emplacement, some calcite veins are still rock buffered (delta(18) O of - 0. 96 to + 0. 2 parts per thousand VPDB and delta(13) C of + 0. 79 to + 1. 37 parts per thousand VPDB), whereas others reflect external (i. e. extraformational) and thus large-scale fluid fluxes. Some of these veins are linked to basement-derived fluid circulation or originated from fluid flow along evaporitic decollement horizons (delta(18) O around + 3. 0 parts per thousand VPDB and delta(13) C around + 1. 5 parts per thousand VPDB). Others are related to the maturation of hydrocarbons in the system (delta(18) O around - 7. 1 parts per thousand VPDB and delta(13) C around + 9. 3 parts per thousand VPDB). An open joint system reflecting an extensional stress regime developed during or after the final folding stage. This joint system enhanced vertical connectivity. This open joint network can be explained by the high palaeotopographical position and the folding of the reservoir analogue within the deformational front. The joint system is pre-Burdigalian in age based upon a dated karstified discordance contact. status: publishe...|$|R
