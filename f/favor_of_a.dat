5|$|A {{supporter}} of nine-man baseball teams, Adams favored a measure in 1856 which allowed for players {{from outside the}} Knickerbockers to join their intrasquad games when 17 or fewer team members appeared. No rules existed at the time regarding team size, but official games between clubs were typically played with nine men per club. The proposal was defeated by a 13–11 vote, in <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rule forbidding non-club members to play if there were 14 players (seven per team).|$|E

In opposition to these developments the Sandomierz Confederation was created by other nobles in support of Augustus. The latter could call on about 75% of the military capacity of the Polish army. Some smaller engagements at Poznań, Lwów, Warsaw and Poniec followed in 1704 {{as a consequence of}} Augustus' attempts to retake the throne.|$|E

5|$|At least 41 systems {{measure the}} severity, or grade, of a mild head injury, {{and there is}} little {{agreement}} about which is best. In an effort to simplify, the 2nd International Conference on Concussion in Sport, meeting in Prague in 2004, decided that these systems should be abandoned in <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 'simple' or 'complex' classification. However, the 2008 meeting in Zurich abandoned the simple versus complex terminology, although the participants did agree to keep the concept that most (80–90%) concussions resolve in a short period (7–10 days), and although the recovery time frame may be longer in children and adolescents.|$|E
5|$|At the time, he had {{his first}} {{confrontation}} with Spanish authorities, since Betances gave last priority of medical treatment to those Spanish-born military rank and officers who were affected by the disease (they demanded preferential and immediate treatment, and he openly despised them for it). For his hard work to save many Puerto Ricans from the ravages of the cholera epidemic of 1856, Betances was commended by the city's government. However, when the central government established a Chief Surgeon post for the city, Betances (who was the acting chief surgeon) was passed over, in <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Spanish newcomer.|$|E

Alabama and Wyoming, already states, had passed resolutions in <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> convention without formally calling for one.|$|E

5|$|Conceived in {{the wake}} of a series of {{distressing}} personal events, 808s & Heartbreak marked a major musical departure for West from his previous rap records, instead featuring a sparse, electronic sound and West singing through an Auto-Tune vocal processor. His lyrics explored themes of loss, alienated fame, and heartache, while the album's production abandoned conventional hip hop sounds in <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimalist sonic palette, which included prominent use of the titular Roland TR-808 drum machine.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became {{mired in the}} complex technical questions of a test ban, driven {{in part by a}} strong interest among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a comprehensive test ban would be abandoned in <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E

Lea was indicted on six felony counts, but prosecutors later dismissed them in <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single misdemeanor tax charge.

That same year, the DRR's track on the northern edge of its route was expanded outwards in order {{to make room for the}} new Videopolis stage. With the Mickey's Toontown expansion of the park, Mickey's Toontown Depot, a cartoon-themed depot building, replaced Videopolis Station in 1993.|$|E
