40|$|Any {{contract}} {{for the sale of}} goods between international commercial traders may be subject to the U. N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). If a buyer suffers damages {{as a result of a}} breach of contract, she is entitled to damages under the Convention. The issue in this thesis is whether a buyer may also invoke product liability actions under national tort law if a <b>defective</b> <b>good</b> causes bodily injury or property damage. The provisions of the CISG generally displace national law governing the rights and obligations deriving from a contract of sale. Despite the desirability of removing the uncertainties of foreign liability regimes from international trade, domestic rules of product liability remain, in general, applicable. Only if national tort actions interfere with the core of the Convention's liability regime, must the domestic law be modified...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the Swedish regulations of purchase taking {{the perspective of}} private persons as a starting point. The law of purchase from the year 1990 is applicable {{on a number of}} legal purchase situations where the contracting parties varies. Nevertheless, the law is mainly focused on the purchase between businessmen. This places private persons on level with businessmen, since they are given equal responsibility regarding legal knowledge and the drawing up of contracts.   In order to get a deeper knowledge of the law of purchase and to reach an understanding of how it should be interpreted we have studied the government bill on the law, cases from the Supreme Court, doctine on the area and legal articles. The purpose with this paper is to examine whether the law of purchase from the year 1990 is too old to be applicable on private purchases today. The reason would be the trade which has been modernised through the increased use of the Internet. Almost 90 % of the trade between private persons takes place through the Internet. Our intention is also to emphasise that the law of purchase lays too much responsibility on private persons and gives them too little protection at private purchases.   Since the law of purchase concentrates on trade between businessmen in the first place it is most suitable for people with legal knowledge. Hence it does not seem logical that it also applies on trade between private persons. The interpretation of the law might be difficult because of its vague wording. Several rules can make it problematic for a purchaser with low knowledge of the rules to invoke the sellers responsibility for a <b>defective</b> <b>good.</b> Moreover, according to the law the purchaser has a duty to inspect the good and this must be done carefully in order to avoid a situation where the seller will be able to escape from his responsibility.   As a result of this the law of purchase do not guarantee private persons any protection in practise. Since contracts are superior to the law it is possible to agree that rules involving protection should not be valid. To avoid insecurity and to secure evidence it is therefore important that the contracting parties carefully draft their contract. A comparison to the legal minimum protection of consumers clearly shows that the protection in the law of purchase seems relatively weak. Furthermore, because the law shall be interpreted in the light of secondary sources of law, which demands exstensive legal knowledge of the general public, legal security might be negatively affected.   We claim that {{it would be possible to}} reach a better harmonisation between the law of purchase and the current trade behaviour through a distinction between the regulation of trade between businessmen and the trade between private persons and also by introducing cogent rules for private persons...|$|E
40|$|Liability for <b>defective</b> <b>goods</b> and its {{application}} The purpose of my thesis is to analyse the legal institute "Liability for defective goods" and {{its application}} regulated by (Czech) Commercial Code.

40|$|Supply chain {{management}} (SCM) {{is a field}} of study which covers {{a wide range of}} research issues involving strategic to operational models. In the past two decades, SCM has drawn much attention from manufacturers and organizations for optimizing their operations. In this paper, a mathematical model to optimize costs of the supply chain for <b>defective</b> and repairable <b>goods</b> through the application of just-in-time (JIT) logistics is proposed. The hypothesis is that the <b>defective</b> <b>goods</b> are repairable {{and some of them are}} considered as scraps. The aim of this model is to minimize the total cost of production, maintenance, freight, reworking, scrap goods and shortage to retailers. The proposed model is novel and LINGO has been used to solve it. The validity of the model was proven by testing 12 sample problems and the results showed correctness and fine function of the model. Based on the data parameters, this model can also determine which manufacturer or distributor in the particular period of the production needs to be active. The model is applicable for all producers that are encountering with problem of producing of <b>defective</b> <b>goods...</b>|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} competitive criteria in the global marketplace is keeping the customer satisfaction. Timely delivery and cost of finished goods are two important factors for satisfaction of customers. In this study, we proposed a mathematical model to improve inventory control of <b>defective</b> <b>goods</b> supply chain by Available Time Limitation (ATL) of the production facilities. The <b>defective</b> <b>goods</b> are reworking able parts and the rest are considered as scraps. The aim of the model is to optimize the total costs of production, maintenance, freight, reworking, the quantity of scrap goods and shortage in retailers for three level supply chains.

Finally, the model determines the Economic Production Quantity (EPQ) and appropriate ATL of any production facilities. Our proposed model is novel and we used CPLEX and LINGO to solve the problem.

40|$|American courts, {{particularly}} during the last decade, have become increasingly {{aware of the need}} for protecting the consumer against dangers inherent in the use of <b>defective</b> <b>goods.</b> In few other fields of law has Corbin 2 ̆ 7 s advice to treat rules of law as 2 ̆ 2 tentative working rules 2 ̆ 2 been more heeded. Continuously and relentlessly our law has expanded contract and tort liability so as to satisfy public needs. Classical contract theory has undergone profound modifications in response to drastic changes {{in the structure of the}} distribution process. Our sales law and particularly the law of warranties likewise has changed. Where contract liability has been regarded as inadequate, it has been supplemented by tort law. There is an ever increasing tendency to permit the consumer injured by <b>defective</b> <b>goods</b> or services to reach the producer directly, if not with the help of contract law, then with the help of a revised law of torts. Not only has the decline of the rules of privity permitted the consumer to reach the producer, but product liability, in contrast to the tenets of classical tort law, is straining away from negligence. In a fascinating blending of tort and contract law, product liability increasingly is becoming strict liability. A theory of enterprise liability has emerged, frequently based on vague and unanalyzed notions of public policy and economics...|$|R

High demands are lodged to meat produce for production of summer sausages. The technological <b>defective</b> <b>goods</b> of sausages not infrequently occur under use of meat raw with non-traditional autolysis and quality. For prevention of <b>defective</b> <b>goods</b> is necessary {{to have an opportunity}} to forecast the chemical content and rheological characteristics of sausages. These indexes are important for prognosis of quality of newly worked out or modernized receipts of sausages. The quality of sausages depends on qualitative indexes of minced meat. One of the indexes of minced beef is a consistence which is assessed not only organoleptically but on rheological characteristics. For production of sausages with advanced chemical content and consistence assessed under the help of rheological characteristics is necessary to work out the method of forecasting of ready goods quality. At projecting of the receipt we were offered to use the calculation of rheological and chemical-technological characteristics. There was described the classification of minced meat as heterogeneous system consisting of dispersive medium and phase.
