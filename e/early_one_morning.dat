5|$|Thomas was an {{accomplished}} writer of prose poetry, with collections such as Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog (1940) and Quite <b>Early</b> <b>One</b> <b>Morning</b> (1954) showing {{he was capable}} of writing moving short stories. His first published prose work was After the Fair, printed in The New English Weekly on 15 March 1934. Jacob Korg believes that Thomas's fiction work can be classified into two main bodies, vigorous fantasies in a poetic style and, after 1939, more straightforward narratives. Korg surmises that Thomas approached his prose writing as an alternate poetic form, which allowed him to produce complex, involuted narratives that do not allow the reader to rest.|$|E
5|$|Bok tried {{twice to}} flee from slavery {{at the age}} of 14. The first {{instance}} happened <b>early</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> after he had been sent out with the cattle. Bok blindly ran down a road for several miles before he was captured by one of Giemma's fellow militia members. Giemma's peer returned Francis to the Giemma's compound, where he was beaten with a bullwhip. Bok attempted to escape once again just two days later, when he fled in the opposite direction of his previous escape. He once again fled for several miles, this time keeping to the forest. He stopped for water at a local stream crossing, where he was spotted by Giemma who happened to be there as well. Giemma forced Francis back to his home, this time promising to kill him. Francis was beaten again, but Giemma chose not to kill him, as Francis had become too valuable to the family as a slave.|$|E

Coached by a psychiatrist (Martin Gabel), Dunnigan tries to relate to the man on the ledge as one human to another.|$|E

500|$|Although Thomas had {{previously}} {{written for the}} BBC, it was a minor and intermittent source of income. In 1943 he wrote and recorded a 15-minute talk entitled [...] "Reminiscences of Childhood" [...] for the Welsh BBC. In December 1944 he recorded Quite <b>Early</b> <b>One</b> <b>Morning</b> (produced by Aneirin Talfan Davies, again for the Welsh BBC) but when Davies offered it for national broadcast BBC London turned it down. On 31 August 1945 the BBC Home Service broadcast Quite <b>Early</b> <b>One</b> <b>Morning,</b> and {{in the three years}} beginning October 1945, Thomas made over a hundred broadcasts for the corporation. Thomas was employed not only for his poetry readings, but for discussions and critiques.|$|E
500|$|In 1944, {{with the}} threat of German flying bombs on London, Thomas moved to the family cottage at Blaen Cwm near Llangain, where Thomas resumed writing poetry, {{completing}} [...] "Holy Spring" [...] and [...] "Vision and Prayer". In September Thomas and Caitlin moved to New Quay in Cardiganshire (Ceredigion), which inspired Thomas to pen the radio piece Quite <b>Early</b> <b>One</b> <b>Morning,</b> a sketch for his later work, Under Milk Wood. Of the poetry written at this time, of note is [...] "Fern Hill", believed to have been started while living in New Quay, but completed at Blaen Cwm in mid-1945.|$|E

[...] "Hang Me, O Hang Me" [...] and [...] "Cuckoo Bird" [...] were traditional folk songs but Dylan altered the words.

500|$|The main titles were {{designed}} by Nick Livesey, {{a graduate of the}} Royal College of Art who worked for one of Scott's production companies in London. The sequence, shot in Florence by Livesey himself was intended as the film's second promotional trailer. The studio thought it not [...] "quite right", but it remained on Scott's mind and would eventually end up as the main title sequence. Livesey would gather footage of pigeons in an empty square in Florence <b>early</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> which, in the final cut, would morph into the face of Hannibal Lecter. Scott believed it a good idea, as it fundamentally asked the question: 'Where is Hannibal Lecter?' Scott explains: [...] "And of course this story tells it, with pigeons in the cobblestones of somewhere, where you wonder where that is...and there he is his face appears." [...] The titles are said to have been influenced by the film Seven.|$|E
500|$|A prose {{introduction}} in {{the poem}} Völundarkviða relates that the brothers Slagfiðr, Egil and Völund dwelt in a house sited in a location called Úlfdalir ("wolf dales"). There, <b>early</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning,</b> the brothers find three women spinning linen {{on the shore of}} the lake Úlfsjár ("wolf lake"), and [...] "near them were their swan's garments; they were valkyries". Two daughters of King Hlödvér are named Hlaðguðr svanhvít ("swan-white") and Hervör alvitr (possibly meaning [...] "all-wise" [...] or [...] "strange creature"); the third, daughter of Kjárr of Valland, is named Ölrún (possibly meaning [...] "beer rune"). The brothers take the three women back to their hall with them—Egil takes Ölrún, Slagfiðr takes Hlaðguðr svanhvít and Völund takes Hervör alvitr. They live together for seven winters, until the women fly off to go to a battle and do not return. Egil goes off in snow-shoes to look for Ölrún, Slagfiðr goes searching for Hlaðguðr svanhvít and Völund sits in Úlfdalir.|$|E
500|$|In 1978 Dibnah was {{commissioned}} to make repairs to Bolton Town Hall. [...] Decades {{of exposure to}} soot and rain had caused serious damage to the clock tower and Dibnah alerted the Clerk of Works to {{the condition of the}} 16stone pillars {{at the top of the}} tower. [...] He bought new stone, built a lathe in his workshop and created the replacement pillars. [...] He was given the job of repairing the clock tower and he also gilded the golden sphere at the top of the building. While [...] Dibnah was working from his bosun's chair, a public relations officer at the Town Hall informed Dibnah that BBC Look North West wanted to interview him. The following week, the film crew arrived and Alistair MacDonald conducted the interview from the top of the building, with Dibnah perched outside on his scaffolding. His warm and friendly manner combined with his enthusiasm and broad Lancashire accent proved popular and he was later contacted by producer Don Haworth, with a view to making a documentary. After several meetings over the course of a few weeks, filming began <b>early</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> just as Dibnah had climbed to the top of a [...] chimney at Shaw and Crompton, a mill town near Oldham. Sporadic filming took place over an 18-month period and captured Dibnah (with assistant Donald Paiton) working on a range of buildings, spending time with his family and enjoying his hobbies. Giulio Briccialdi's Carnival Of Venice (performed by James Galway) was the music chosen to accompany Dibnah's work on Bolton Town Hall. One of the more notable aspects was Dibnah's 1979 demolition of a chimney in Rochdale. Standing only yards away from the base of the chimney as it began to collapse, his retreat to safety and subsequent boyish outburst of [...] "Did you like that?" [...] endeared him to viewers.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is quite dark and mysterious, {{as much of it}} is often {{interpreted}} to be dealing with issues such as substance abuse, suicide, and depression, with running themes of revenge, annihilation, seclusion, fear, loss, death, and discovery. Cornell was inspired by the writings of Sylvia Plath at the time. Commenting on the album's lyrics, Thayil said that [...] "a lot of Superunknown {{seems to me to be}} about life, not death. Maybe not affirming it, but rejoicing—like the Druids : 'Life is good, but death's gonna be even better!" [...] Cameron said that the lyrics on the album are [...] "a big fuck-you to the world, a plea to 'leave us alone. Cornell stated that [...] "Let Me Drown" [...] is about [...] "crawling back to the womb to die", [...] "Fell on Black Days" [...] is about realizing [...] "you're unhappy in the extreme", [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] is about a [...] "surreal dreamscape", [...] "Limo Wreck" [...] is a [...] "'shame-on-decadence' song", [...] "The Day I Tried to Live" [...] is about [...] "trying to step out of being patterned and closed off and reclusive", and [...] "4th of July" [...] is about using LSD. Cornell talked about [...] "Mailman" [...] at a concert saying, [...] "This next one is about killing your boss. It's about coming to work <b>early</b> <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> cause you have a special agenda and you're going to shoot him in the fucking head." [...] Conversely, [...] "Like Suicide" [...] was literal, written by Cornell after a bird flew into a window of his house. He found the severely injured animal and killed it, hitting it with a brick to end its suffering.|$|E
