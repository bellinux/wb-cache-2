Penfield also discovered that the sensory or motor maps were topographical; areas of the body adjacent to one another would likely be adjacent on the cortical maps.|$|E

50|$|In humans, electroejaculation {{is usually}} carried out under a general anesthetic. An <b>electric</b> <b>probe</b> is {{inserted}} into the rectum adjacent to the prostate gland. The probe delivers an AC voltage, usually 12-24 volts sine wave at a frequency of 60 Hz, with a current limited to usually 500 mA, although some devices can generate currents of up to 1 A. The probe is activated for 1-2 seconds, {{referred to as a}} stimulus cycle. Ejaculation usually occurs after 2-3 stimulus cycles. Care must be taken when using currents greater than 500 mA, as tissue burns may result due to heating of the probe. The stimulus voltage stimulates nearby nerves, resulting in contraction of the pelvic muscles and ejaculation. This procedure is used frequently with large mammals, particularly bulls and some domestic animals, as well as humans who have certain types of anejaculation. Electroejaculation has also been used for Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources where one would collect semen and stored in low temperatures with the intent of conserving genetic material and future revival.|$|E
5000|$|Bain {{worked on}} an {{experimental}} fax machine in 1843 to 1846. He used a clock to synchronise {{the movement of}} two pendulums for line-by-line scanning of a message. For transmission, Bain applied metal pins arranged on a cylinder made of insulating material. An <b>electric</b> <b>probe</b> that transmitted on-off pulses then scanned the pins. The message was reproduced at the receiving station on electrochemically sensitive paper impregnated with a chemical solution similar to that developed for his chemical telegraph. In his patent description dated 27 May 1843 for [...] "improvements in producing and regulating electric currents and improvements in timepieces, and in electric printing, and signal telegraphs," [...] he claimed that [...] "a copy of any other surface composed of conducting and non-conducting materials can be taken by these means". The transmitter and receiver were connected by five wires. In 1850 he applied for an improved version but was too late, as Frederick Bakewell had obtained a patent for his superior [...] "image telegraph" [...] two years earlier in 1848.|$|E

A standing electromagnetic wave, which is confined by aresonator cavity, penetrates the plasma and sustains it in the regions of highest fieldintensity. The geometry of this region determines the spatial distribution of the plasma. Plasmas excited in resonator mode are less resistant against detuning, for instance by the insertion of <b>electric</b> <b>probes</b> (Langmuir probes) or electrically conducting samples comparedto surface-wave plasmas.
