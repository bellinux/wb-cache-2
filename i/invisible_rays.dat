25|$|Both the 30-minute and 15-minute {{programs}} were performed and broadcast live. If a line was flubbed or an accident happened, the actors recovered {{as quickly as}} possible and soldiered on. The pressure of memorizing lines for a new live 15-minute show every day (Monday through Friday) was onerous enough, but became even more burdensome when the 30-minute weekly Saturday show was added beginning Dec. 30, 1950. Around this time, Moser began sharing the writing chores with Norman Jolley. The actors' tasks were increasingly difficult because they faced the complexity of coordinating their on-camera movements with intricate special effects, which also had to be created live and in real-time. For example, pistols that shot <b>invisible</b> <b>rays</b> necessitated pre-positioning small electrically wired explosive charges on the surface they were supposed to strike. An actor would aim the prop ray gun at that location and squeeze the trigger, whereupon a special effects worker off-scene would throw the detonation switch.|$|E

The terms chemical and heat rays were eventually dropped in favour of ultraviolet and infrared radiation, respectively.|$|E

50|$|Back in 1936, Boris Karloff was {{originally}} selected {{to play the}} role of Dan McCormick with Bela Lugosi to appear as Dr. Rigas. This earlier version of the film, which was titled The Electric Man, ended up being scrapped by the studio because the concept was too similar to another Karloff/Lugosi movie, The <b>Invisible</b> <b>Ray.</b> The script was then shelved for the next four years before being revived in 1940 under new management at Universal.|$|R
5000|$|In 1801, German {{physicist}} Johann Wilhelm Ritter discovered ultraviolet in {{an experiment}} similar to Hershel's, using sunlight and a glass prism. Ritter noted that <b>invisible</b> <b>rays</b> near the violet edge of a solar spectrum dispersed by a triangular prism darkened silver chloride preparations more quickly than did the nearby violet light. Ritter's experiments were an early precursor to what would become photography. Ritter noted that the ultraviolet rays (which at first were called [...] "chemical rays") were capable of causing chemical reactions.|$|E
5000|$|Electromagnetic {{radiation}} of wavelengths {{other than}} those of visible light were discovered in the early 19th century. The discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to astronomer William Herschel, who published his results in 1800 before the Royal Society of London.

When an object absorbs radiation from a warmer object (calorific rays) its temperature rises, and when it absorbs radiation from a colder object (frigorific rays) it temperature falls.

50|$|While the long, {{creative}} {{partnership between}} Karloff and Bela Lugosi never {{led to a}} close friendship, it produced some of the actors' most revered and enduring productions, beginning with The Black Cat (1934).

During this period, he also starred with Basil Rathbone in Tower of London (1939) as the murderous henchman of King Richard III, and with Margaret Lindsay in British Intelligence (1940).

5000|$|From an {{examination}} of the researches of Sir John Herschel on the coloring matter of plants, it will be seen that the action of the sun's rays is to destroy the color, effecting a sort of chromatic analysis, in which two distinct elements of color are separated, by destroying the one and leaving the other. The action is confined within the visible spectrum, and thus a broad distinction is exhibited between the action of the sun's rays on vegetable juices and on argentinecompounds, the latter being most sensibly affected by the <b>invisible</b> <b>rays</b> beyond the violet. It may also be observed, that the rays effective in destroying a given tint, are in a great many cases, those whose union produces a color complementary to the tint destroyed, or, at least, one belonging to that class of colors to which such complementary tint may be preferred. For instance, yellows tending towards orange are destroyed with more energy by the blue rays; blues by the red, orange and yellow rays; purples and pinks by yellow and green rays. Henry H.

2500|$|Regardless of controversy, five films at Universal — The Black Cat, The Raven, The <b>Invisible</b> <b>Ray,</b> Son of Frankenstein, Black Friday (plus minor cameo {{performances}} in 1934's Gift of Gab) and two at RKO Pictures, You'll Find Out and The Body Snatcher — paired Lugosi with Boris Karloff. Despite the relative {{size of their}} roles, Lugosi inevitably got second billing, below Karloff. There are contradictory reports of Lugosi's attitude toward Karloff, some claiming that he was openly resentful of Karloff's long-term success and ability to get good roles beyond the horror arena, while others suggested the two actors were — for a time, at least — good friends. Karloff himself in interviews suggested that Lugosi was initially mistrustful of him when they acted together, believing that the Englishman would attempt to upstage him. When this proved {{not to be the}} case, according to Karloff, Lugosi settled down and they worked together amicably (though some have further commented that Karloff's on-set demand to break from filming for mid-afternoon tea annoyed Lugosi). Karloff also insinuated that his iconic rival could not act, claiming Lugosi had [...] "never learned his trade". Universal did cast Lugosi in a couple of heroic parts, as in The Black Cat after Karloff had been accorded the more colorful role of the villain, The <b>Invisible</b> <b>Ray,</b> and a romantic role in the adventure serial The Return of Chandu, but his typecasting problem appears to have been too entrenched to be alleviated by those films. Of course, Karloff had a leg up on Lugosi simply by being a native English speaker; Lugosi had to learn English as a second language, and was never able to shed his heavy accent.|$|R
