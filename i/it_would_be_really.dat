The first edit was over 14minutes long and included a long organ interlude performed by Jonny Greenwood. Radiohead played this extended version during a tour with Alanis Morissette in September 1996. [...] "When we started playing it live, it was completely hilarious," [...] recalled O'Brien. [...] "There was a rave down section and a Hammond organ outro, and we'd be pissing ourselves while we played. We'd bring out the glockenspiel and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>really,</b> really funny." [...] Before the song's first live performance, Yorke told audiences that [...] "f you can have sex to this one, you're fucking weird." [...] He also sarcastically referred to the version of the song played during the tour as [...] "a Pink Floyd cover".|$|E

Jonny and Plank are inspired by one of Antonucci's childhood friends, a loner who spent most of his time outside with his blanket. He stated that he believed it was important to add Plank, a board of wood, to the show, and that he [...] "thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own" [...] and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do. Some wanted Plank to be able to talk, smile and blink as if he was alive, but Antonucci insisted that it should be treated as a piece of wood, brought to life by Jonny's imagination.|$|E
500|$|Ayola {{has since}} {{explained}} that her {{change of heart}} stemmed from becoming a mother. In {{the early years of}} her marriage to fellow actor Adam Smethurst the couple struggled financially, and with the added expense of the birth of their daughter, Ayola had been on the verge of giving up her acting career to begin a business franchise. [...] On joining the cast of Holby City, she disclosed: [...] "I've been someone who's loved the uncertainty of acting. I've loved that one month it's Sahara in Morocco and the next I'm doing a stage play, then it's a six-part telly thing. But last summer I started thinking <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> nice not to have to look for a job every couple of weeks. It would be nice just to stay put for a while. If I'm going to be a working mum I'd rather just be one rather than be one intermittently. And then Holby came along, so I'm very grateful." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The song {{has kind}} of an old school vibe to it, {{so we wanted to}} be really {{stripped}} down and really simple with the video. Every time we get the chance to work together I always try to do something a little different, you know. I hadn't seen her a do a real stripped down, really basic video. I got a taste of it when I did another video with her where she was a guest star, and I got her really stripped down in that but it was still in a Jamaican environment. I just wanted to put her in a really contemporary American environment and bring out the emotions in the song and the bittersweetness of it. Me and her were just vibing off that, and thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> fun to do something just really simple. No visual effects, no gags. The whole strength of the video is on just the honesty of the piece, and that was sort of what we set out to do. Sometimes it's an important visual effect, today it's an important emotion." ...|$|E
500|$|From 7 February 2006 to 9 December 2008, Ayola {{starred in}} BBC medical drama Holby City as nurse Kyla Tyson. She had {{previously}} appeared in Holby City sister show Casualty, {{and had made}} an appearance in Holby City fifth series as patient Marianne Lawson. She was approached about returning to the show in a more permanent role by BBC casting director Julie Harkin. After {{a series of three}} meetings, a year after the birth of her first child, she agreed to assume the role of Kyla, despite being [...] "nervous about signing such a long contract", stating: [...] "I've been someone who's loved the uncertainty of acting.

500|$|The group {{wrote and}} {{performed}} children's music {{that was different}} from {{what had been done}} previously; as Cook stated, [...] "we didn't just go down the route of what people think is kids' music". [...] They were not tied to one style or genre of music and often experimented in the studio; while some of their recordings were orchestral, others had a more live feel. The group was aware that their songs were often children's first exposure to music. Guitar Magazine speculated that since Cook {{was one of the first}} guitarists children were exposed to, he may be the most influential guitarist in the world. [...] Cook was conscious that he was probably the first guitarist children would see, and said, [...] "I always think that if it inspires kids to play guitar later on that would be great. I think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> nice if in 15years I read that somebody got into guitar playing because of [...] Wiggles". [...] In 2013, after Cook retired from touring with the group and became their touring manager, he reported that newer bands like Regular John approached him and said that The Wiggles were the first band [...] "they got into".|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} idea for Dragon Quest {{came during the}} development of the NES port of Portopia. Horii and Nakamura came across the RPG Wizardry at a Macworld Conference & Expo. While it had some influence on the NES Portopias dungeon crawl segments, Horii liked the game's depth and visuals. He wanted to create a game similar to Wizardry, to expose the mainly Western-exclusive RPG genre to Japan and to expand the genre past computer enthusiasts. Horii also cited Ultima as an inspiration for Dragon Quests gameplay, specifically the first-person random battles in Wizardry and the overhead perspective of Ultima. While the RPG genre was predominantly Western and limited to PCs, Japanese gamers enjoyed home-grown games such as The Black Onyx and the Dragon Slayer series alongside Western RPG ports. However, while Horii and Nakamura enjoyed the dungeon crawling and statistical nature of Wizardry, they realized most people would not. This had not originally been a concern, but the success of Super Mario Bros. greatly increased the potential audience of any new Famicom/NES game. To create Dragon Quest, the gameplay needed to be simplified. According to Horii: [...] "There was no keyboard, and the system was much simpler, using just a [...] controller. But I still thought that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> exciting for the player to play as their alter ego in the game. I personally was playing Wizardry and Ultima at the time, and I really enjoyed seeing my own self in the game." ...|$|E

So when I watched some of it on tape I was totally amazed that you couldn't see how frightened I really was. I kept thinking, 'Oh my God! I'm working with Adrian Lester and Robert Vaughn. Any time now someone is going to tap me on the shoulder and ask me to get my coat!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Outhwaite has {{suggested}} that the wardrobe department struggled {{to come up with a}} static identity for Melanie at first; however, this she felt turned out to be a good thing: [...] "What I really liked about it was, when we started looking for costumes , the wardrobe department couldn't quite fit where I was going. I'd wear Army pants and trainers some days and then jeans some other days and then I'd be all suited and booted at other times. I said, 'That's what girls do! That's how I am. Some days I'm in scruffs and some days I'm really dressed up. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> nice to have a character who's not so predictable.'" [...] Rosalind Powell, head of the EastEnders wardrobe design team in 2000, said that Mel had [...] "colourful and stylish" [...] wardrobe from retailers such as Kookai and Oasis. Powell added, [...] "Although she's a barmaid, she can still afford to wear nice clothes, she just doesn't have a very big wardrobe." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hatfield was {{profiled}} {{in a number}} of girls' magazines at this time and was embraced by many pre-teen and teenage girls as a role model due to the positive way she addressed serious issues faced by young women in her songs and interviews. About this period she says: [...] "I was never comfortable with the attention. I thought it had come too soon. I hadn’t earned it yet." [...] She gained notoriety in 1992 for saying that she was still a virgin in her mid-twenties in Interview magazine. In a 1994 interview for the magazine Vox, she said she was surprised by the effect 'outing' herself had: [...] "I {{think there are a lot}} of people out there who don't care about sex, but who you never hear from, so I thought I should say it. The magazine I did the interview for is full of beef-cake hunky guys and scantily-clad models, so I thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>really</b> funny to say that I didn't care about sex in a magazine that's full of sex and beauty – but no one really got the joke." ...|$|E
