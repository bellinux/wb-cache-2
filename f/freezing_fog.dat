Abashiri receives less precipitation than any other city in Japan because its location on the drift-ice-affected Sea of Okhotsk, which, however, causes Abashiri to receive less sunshine than the northeast coast since winter snowfall is heavier and fog less confined to the summer months when the Oyashio Current is strongest.

25|$|Gardermoen has had {{considerable}} problems with fog and freezing rain, and has several times had a complete close-down. This {{was also a}} problem at Fornebu, and reported to be at Hurum as well. On average there is super cooled rain three times per month during the winter. The use of deicing fluids is restricted since the area underneath the airport contains the Tandrum Delta, one of the country's largest uncontained quaternary aquifers (underground water systems). On 14 December 1998, a combination of <b>freezing</b> <b>fog</b> and supercooled rain caused glaze at Gardermoen. At least twenty aircraft engines were damaged by ice during take-off, and five aircraft needed to make precautionary landings with only one working engine. On 18 January 2006, an Infratek deicing system was set up, that uses infrared heat in large hangar tents. It was hoped that it could reduce chemical deicers by 90%, but the technique has proved unsuccessful.|$|E

40|$|<b>Freezing</b> of gait (<b>FOG)</b> is a {{disabling}} phenomenon {{common in}} patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD). The cause of FOG is unclear. The objective {{of this study was}} to explore a novel hypothesis stating that FOG is related to asymmetric motor performance. We compared PD patients that experience FOG episodes (PDFOG) with PD patients that do not (PDFOG) and studied the relationship of FOG to asymmetry in gait and in rhythmic hand movement performance to determine whether potential FOG-related gait asymmetry is unique to walking or whether it is systemic. Subjects were tested in an “off ” (unmedicated) and again in an “on ” (medicated) state. Gait was more asymmetric in PDFOG than in PDFOG during “off ” state (p 0. 005) and during “on ” (p 0. 016). Rhythmicity of foot swing in one leg was correlated with the other leg in PDFOG but not in PDFOG. There was no difference in asymmetry in performance of rhythmic hand movements between the two groups. No correlation was found between asymmetry of clinical symptoms and gait asymmetry. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that bilateral uncoordinated gait and marked gait asymmetry, but not asymmetry in motor performance in general, are associated with FOG.

40|$|<b>Freezing</b> of gait (<b>FOG)</b> is an incapacitating {{problem in}} Parkinson's disease that is {{difficult}} to manage therapeutically. We tested the hypothesis that impaired rhythm and amplitude control is a common mechanism of freezing which is also present during other rhythmic tasks. Therefore, we compared the occurrence and spatiotemporal profiles of freezing episodes during upper limb motion, lower limb motion, and FOG. Eleven freezers, 12 non-freezers, and 11 controls performed a rhythmic bilateral finger movement task. The triggering effect of movement speed, amplitude, and coordination pattern was evaluated. Regression slopes and spectral analysis addressed the spatial and temporal kinematic changes inherent to <b>freezing</b> episodes. The <b>FOG</b> Questionnaire score significantly predicted severity of upper limb freezing, present in 9 freezers, and of foot freezing, present in 8 freezers. Similar to gait, small-amplitude movements tended to trigger upper limb freezing, which was preceded by hastened movement and a strong amplitude breakdown. Upper limb freezing power spectra were broadband, including increased energy in the "freeze band" (3 - 8 Hz). Contrary to FOG, unilateral upper limb freezing was common and occurred mainly on the disease-dominant side. The findings emphasize that a core motor problem underlies freezing which can affect various movement effectors. This deficit may originate on the disease-dominant body side and interfere with amplitude and timing regulation during repetitive limb movements. These results may shift current thinking on the origins of freezing as being not exclusively a gait failure. © 2011 Movement Disorder Society. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Freezing</b> of Gait (<b>FOG)</b> is {{a common}} and {{disabling}} symptom in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). The relationship between FOG and dopaminergic medication is complex. The aim {{of the present study}} was to estimate the prevalence of self-reported FOG, its associated clinical features, and its relationship with wearing-off in a wide PD population. This is an observational multicenter study of 634 consecutive non-demented PD patients. Patients were identified either as freezers or non-freezers based on item- 3 of the <b>Freezing</b> of Gait-Questionnaire. <b>FOG</b> was then classified as on, off and onoff freezing based on its relationship with wearing-off. Patients were assessed with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr scale, 8 -item Parkinson's disease Questionnaire, Mini-Mental State Examination. Data from 593 patients were analyzed, 325 (54. 3 %) were freezers of whom 200 (61. 6 %) experienced FOG only during off state (off-freezers), 6 (1. 8 %) only during on state and 119 (36. 6 %) either in on and off states or independently of dopaminergic response-related symptoms (onoff-freezers). Overall, freezers vs non-freezers had longer disease duration, more advanced disease and greater disability. Moreover, freezers more frequently reported wearing-off and experienced worse quality of life. Onoff-freezers vs off-freezers were older, more severely disabled, less likely to experience wearing-off, treated with lower levodopa equivalent daily dose and with poorer cognitive performance. Self-reported FOG is mainly recognizable in advanced PD and is associated with more disability and worse quality of life.
