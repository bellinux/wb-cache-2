5000|$|In December 2012, it was {{announced}} that an upcoming storyline would see Tracy begin a relationship with Rob Donovan (Marc Baylis), the brother of Carla Connor (Alison King). Speaking of the storyline a Coronation Street source said: [...] "Tracy and Rob are a match made in soap heaven, They will be fiery, passionate and out to cause trouble." [...] Baylis went on to say: [...] "Watch this space - interestingly, Tracy Barlow comes onto his radar. [...] That is an interesting combination. Without a doubt, he sees something of himself in Tracy and finds her intriguing!" [...] Ford admitted: [...] "She Tracy likes the fact that he's quite feisty - it takes one to know one, after all. Maybe they're kindred spirits!" [...] Asked about the kind of a dynamic between Rob and Tracy, Baylis told Digital Spy: [...] "There's a lot of joyful banter - they challenge each other in a fun way. They're quite similar, they can see those similarities and they <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fun together. They put a smile on each other's faces, and we'll just have to see how it goes from there." [...] Asked if Rob can hold his own when it comes to Tracy, Baylis replied: [...] ""Definitely, otherwise he wouldn't get involved. He is aware of the whole situation that happened with Ryan last year, but he's got a few more years on Ryan and he's been round the block a few times. Rob definitely wouldn't get involved in something that he didn't think he could handle. But Rob does have an arrogant side, and he feels like he could deal with anything. That's one of Rob's main flaws. I've really enjoyed working with Kate Ford on the storyline - we've had an absolute blast. We've been working a lot together, and hopefully the working relationship that we've built up behind the scenes will come across on screen. I'm looking forward to seeing that unfold myself." [...] When asked how Rob first gets Tracy's attention, Ford told All About Soap: [...] "Well, Tracy's going off shopping in town and she gets into a taxi at exactly the same time as Rob. She demands that he leave, as it's her taxi and not his. He refuses to move though, and when Steve asks them where they're going and they both say the city centre at the same time, they share a smile and end up going in the cab together. She likes the fact that he's quite feisty - it takes one to know one, after all. Maybe they're kindred spirits!" [...] Ford also stated that not only is Tracy attracted to Rob, she realises that it would also annoy Michelle (Kym Marsh), adding: [...] "If he had got out of the taxi, she probably wouldn't have fancied him. He's quite easy on the eye too, of course. Plus, he hangs round with Michelle, and if Tracy and Rob were an item, it would annoy her - that's another good reason for Tracy." [...] On Tracy's reaction to being asked out by Rob, she said: [...] "She's quite annoyed at first and she turns him down. But he persists and he flatters her, so she thinks, why not? I think he's like a nicer version of Charlie, so maybe. He's got the bad lad streak, he's ruthless, but he's nowhere near as cruel as Charlie." ...|$|E

The study was performed at Stockholms läns sjukvårdsområde (SLSO) and the purpose of this project is to evaluate the support given by SLSO innovation gateway. Innovation gateway is an approach that has been spread to some of Sweden's county councils, where the aim is to take advantage of the staffs ideas and to develop products and services based on activities that contribute to improving health care. Interviews and observations have been made to understand the innovation environment in Stockholms läns lansting. This gave an understanding for which user-centred aspects that are important to consider when developing eHealth innovations. Aspects like security, usability and availability are essential to consider when creating innovations that create value for patients and employees. The results also showed that staffs need better support from the organization and an understanding and knowledge in information technology, law and project management to be able to manage and develop eHealth innovations. The study has also shown that the client, the project and developers must all be involved in the innovation process and work with the organization to succeed.

40|$|Transitions are long, {{complex and}} gradual {{processes}} that often start with niche experiments {{with a new}} technology. Battery powered vehicles {{are one of the}} promising technologies at the start of such a transition. With the ambition of the Netherlands to be a leading player in the transition towards electric mobility, several niche experiments are taking place. Literature emphasizes the important role of experiments in a protected space {{at the start of a}} transition. In order to build successful niche experiments, the shaping of expectations and multiple learning processes are seen as important steps. Both first- and second-order learning by providers is necessary to learn both from the technology and about preferences and the social embedding of the technology in society. Users play an important role in these processes. The goal of this research is therefore to shed light on the way interactions with users are shaped in niche experiments with electric vehicles in the Netherlands. This research is conducted as a multiple case study. Interviews with both providers of experiments and users in these experiments provided in-depth insight in the interactions between them in the four cases under investigation. Most important outcomes are that providers of niche experiments have difficulties in selecting the right users for their experiments and tend to have too little focus on the interaction with the users. Providers should therefore think about the users they want to incorporate in their experiment and the way they will setup a close interaction with these users before the experiment starts. This research showed that users <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> knowledge about the technology and the experiment they are being a part of, but also showed the difficulties of project teams to extract these learnings from the users. In conclusion, literature warns for a too strong focus on technological learning and highlights the role users can play in societal learning processes. Most experiments however proved to have this strong focus on technological learning, despite the role users can play in societal learning processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} of this thesis {{is focused on}} the optimization of laser beam welding of PMlOOO with respect to its high temperature mechanica! properties. This nickel chromium alloy is used for the thermal protection system of the re-entry test vehicle of ESA; Expert. With respect to the ceramic tiles which are used in conventional thermal protection systems, metals <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> sustainable advantages. For instance the ductility and the self healing capabilities will {{have a positive effect on}} the maintenance characteristics of the thermal protection system. PMlOOO makes use of yttrium oxide (1203) for the dispersion hardening which is responsible for the good mechanica! properties at high temperatures. This research focused therefore on the relation between the yttrium oxide in original state in the welds and the mechanica! properties of the welds. To optimize the laser beam wel ding process the wel ding speed (v) and the laser beam power (P) is varied. The first weld series (weld series I) is investigated with optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, hardness tests and morphology research. From these results three weld parameter combinations are chosen (weld series II) which are used for tensile tests at temperatures from room temperature up to 1250 °C. The parameters are chosen such that the infiuence of the welding speed and the welding power is individually measured. There are also tensile tests performed on the PMlOOO base material to set a reference. With optical microscopy it is shown that the macrostructure of the welds exists out of dendrites. In the middle of the weld the dendrites form a center line. The scanning electron microscope showed large amounts of black spots in the weld. With EDX analysis the elements in the spots are identified as titanium, yttrium, aluminum and oxygen. During welding the yttrium oxide is melted and farms yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG: Y 3 Al 50 12) in these spots. A part of this material is mixed out at the surface of the weld. The particles do not have a large infiuence on the mechanica! properties of the welds. From the morphology of the welds, the weld efficiency is calculated. The best welds are welded with a heat input between 24 J/mm and 36 J /mm. The efficiency is the highest close to 24 J /mm. Aerospace Materials and StructuresAerospace Engineerin...|$|E
