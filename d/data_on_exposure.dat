40|$|Methods of {{adjusting}} for bias in estimates due to mismeasured or missing covariates and outcomes {{through the use}} of validation sets have been developed in many types of health studies. These methods can be employed for the efficient design and analysis of vaccine studies as well. On the one hand, nonspecific case definitions can lead to attenuated efficacy and effectiveness estimates, but confirmation by culture or a quick test of the infectious agent is also expensive and difficult. On the other hand, <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>exposure</b> to infection can influence estimates of vaccine efficacy, but good <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>exposure</b> are difficult to obtain. In this paper, the authors show how use of small validation sets can correct the bias of the estimates obtained from a large main study while maintaining efficiency. They illustrate the approach for outcomes using the example of influenza vaccine efficacy and effectiveness trials and illustrate the approach for exposure to infection using the example of a human immunodeficiency virus vaccine trial. The authors discuss challenges posed by infectious diseases in the use of currently available methods. Development of these efficient designs and methods of analysis for vaccine field studies will improve estimation of vaccine efficacy for both susceptibility and infectiousness, as well as estimation of indirect and overall effects of vaccination in community trials.

The wide range of available consumer products is associated with an even wider variation in consumers and product use. Measured <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>exposure</b> to compounds in products is not always available. In the absence of these data, ConsExpo 4. 0 can be used to estimate the exposure for different exposure scenarios. The program offers a number of generally applicable exposure models and a database with <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>exposure</b> factors for a broad set of consumer products. Together, database and models provide the tools to assess exposure {{for a wide range of}} consumer products, whereby only basic additional information on product composition and the physicochemical properties of the compound of interest are needed. Moreover, ConsExpo 4. 0 can be used to obtain insight in the factors affecting exposure levels to compounds in consumer product by using the tools of sensitivity analysis and probabilistic calculation. In the development of the fourth version of the program special effort has been taken to improve transparency and ease of use of the software.

40|$|Abstract Background Estimates of {{the burden}} of disease caused by a {{particular}} agent are used to assist in making policy and prioritizing actions. Most estimations have employed the attributable fraction approach, which estimates the proportion of disease cases or deaths in a specific year which are attributable to past exposure to a particular agent. While this approach has proven extremely useful in quantifying health effects, it requires historical <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>exposures</b> which are not always available. Methods We present an alternative method, the future excess fraction method, which is based on the lifetime risk approach, and which requires current rather than historical exposure data. This method estimates the future number of exposure-related disease cases or deaths occurring in the subgroup of the population who were exposed to the particular agent in a specific year. We explain this method and use publically-available <b>data</b> <b>on</b> current asbestos <b>exposure</b> and mesothelioma incidence to demonstrate the use of the method. Conclusions Our approach to modelling burden of disease is useful when there are no historical measures of exposure and where future disease rates can be projected on person years at risk...|$|R

40|$|Background: Children {{engage in}} various {{physical}} activities that pose different injury risks. However, {{the lack of}} adequate <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>exposure</b> has meant that these risks have not been quantified or compared in young children aged 5 - 12 years. Objectives: To measure exposure to popular activities among Australian primary school children and to quantify the associated injury risks. Method: The Childhood Injury Prevention Study prospectively followed up a cohort of randomly selected Australian primary and preschool children aged 5 - 12 years. Time (min) engaged in various physical activities was measured using a parent-completed 7 -day diary. All injuries over 12 months were reported to the study. All <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>exposure</b> and injuries were coded using the International classification of external causes of injury. Injury rates per 1000 h of exposure were calculated for the most popular activities. Results: Complete diaries and data on injuries were available for 744 children. Over 12 months, 314 injuries relating to physical activity outside of school were reported. The highest injury risks per exposure time occurred for tackle-style football (2. 18 / 1000 h), wheeled activities (1. 72 / 1000 h) and tennis (1. 19 / 1000 h). Overall, boys were injured more often than girls; however, the differences were non-significant or reversed for some activities including soccer, trampolining and team ball sports. Conclusion: Although the overall injury rate was low in this prospective cohort, the safety of some popular childhood activities can be improved so that the benefits may be enjoyed with fewer negative consequences...|$|E

30|$|The {{study and}} its design have several strengths. Through a longitudinal, {{prospective}} design, this project performs repeated measurements of work factors, intervening variables, and outcomes.

As the survey part builds on the well-established QPS_Nordic (Dallner et al. 2000) {{as well as on}} other standardized inventories, the included instruments are psychometrically tested for validity and reliability. Several moderating or mediating factors are measured, allowing the study of social and psychological mechanisms of effects. Registry data are objective data and the data structure allows for multilevel models where individual level data are aggregated to department and organizational levels. Finally, the acquired response rate at the baseline survey assessment is in accordance with the estimated average response rate established in this kind of survey research (Baruch and Holtom 2008).|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the availability of}} information from poisons centres and other sources that would characterise the nature of accidental exposure to household chemical products to improve risk management. The DeNaMiC project was funded by European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) and {{was carried out by}} the poisons centres in Göttingen, Lille, London and Prague, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, the World Health Organization and the Health Protection Agency (UK). Method: The project involved developing an analytical tool to compare <b>data</b> <b>on</b> accidental poisoning obtained from the published literature, poisons centre annual reports and official mortality and morbidity statistics, and comparing and mapping the data collection and product classification schemes used by three poisons centres (Göttingen, Lille and London). A retrospective analysis of 3 years of enquiry data from Göttingen and Lille was also carried out to determine routinely available <b>data</b> <b>on</b> circumstances of <b>exposure.</b> European poisons centres were surveyed to {{determine the}} availability of data useful for product risk assessment. In addition, an analysis of published literature on toxicovigilance and a survey of toxicovigilance activities of European poisons centres was carried out. Finally, the project explored the feasibility of using poisons centres to obtain additional information about circumstances of exposure through a prospective followup study. Results: A range of publicly available <b>data</b> <b>on</b> accidental <b>exposures</b> was found; however, this provided little on the circumstances of exposure and could only be compared qualitatively. The product classification schemes used by three poisons centres showed some degree of comparability for household products. European poisons centres collected the same base data set but varied in collecting data relevant for risk assessment. European poisons centres varied in their understanding of ‘toxicovigilance’ but most stated that they perform it. It was possible to collect additional prospective <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>exposures</b> to household products relevant for risk assessment and management. Conclusions: Poisons centres are an important potential source of data useful for product risk assessment and management. In most cases, however, this requires additional work that needs to be resourced. Cooperation between poisons centres and industry can contribute to improving product safety...|$|R
