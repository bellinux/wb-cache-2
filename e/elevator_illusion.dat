40|$|It has {{generally}} been believed that the perceived intensity of a gravitational-inertial force depends on both the magnitude and orientation of the force {{with respect to the}} otolith organs, as does the <b>elevator</b> <b>illusion.</b> In this study, we examine the perceived intensity of Gz force and the <b>elevator</b> <b>illusion</b> {{as a function of the}} applied force and the orientation of the subject's head. Methods: Each of 7 male subjects was seated upright in a swinging chair mounted in the Ames 20 -G Human Centrifuge while he set a visual target to his apparent horizon and judged the perceived intensity of Gz forces by cross-modal matches on a hand dynamometer. Plateau Gz levels were 1. 00 1. 25, 1. 50, 2. 00, 2. 25, and 2. 50; a 30 second ramp to plateau was used in all cases, and the duration of exposure at each plateau was 120 seconds. All measures were obtained both with the subject's head erect and pitched forward 30 degrees. Results: Although the <b>elevator</b> <b>illusion</b> changed with head orientation (F(6, 60) = 7. 56; p less than 0. 001) the perceived intensity of Gz was essentially the same for both orientations of the head (F (6, 60) = 0. 61; p greater than 50). Conclusions: The results of this experiment suggest that the perceived intensity of gravitational-inertial force does not depend on otolith mechanisms in the same way as does the <b>elevator</b> <b>illusion</b> and that somesthetic, tactile, and other proprioceptive inputs are important for the psychophysical function...|$|E
40|$|Ten {{subjects}} {{served as}} their own controls in two conditions of continuous, centrifugally produced hypergravity (+ 2 Gz) and a 1 -G control condition. Before and after exposure, open-loop measures were obtained of (1) motor control, (2) visual localization, and (3) hand-eye coordination. During exposure in the visual feedback/hypergravity condition, subjects received terminal visual error-corrective feedback from their target pointing, and in the no-visual feedback/hypergravity condition they pointed open loop. As expected, the motor control measures for both experimental conditions revealed very short lived underreaching (the muscle-loading effect) {{at the outset of}} hypergravity and an equally transient negative aftereffect on returning to 1 G. The substantial (approximately 17 degrees) initial <b>elevator</b> <b>illusion</b> experienced in both hypergravity conditions declined {{over the course of the}} exposure period, whether or not visual feedback was provided. This effect was tentatively attributed to habituation of the otoliths. Visual feedback produced a smaller additional decrement and a postexposure negative after-effect, possible evidence for visual recalibration. Surprisingly, the target-pointing error made during hypergravity in the no-visual-feedback condition was substantially less than that predicted by subjects' <b>elevator</b> <b>illusion.</b> This finding calls into question the neural outflow model as a complete explanation of this illusion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Perception of body {{orientation}} and apparent location of objects are altered when humans are using assisted means of locomotion {{and the resultant}} of the imposed acceleration and gravity is no longer aligned with the gravitational vertical. As the otolithic system cannot discriminate the acceleration of gravity from sustained inertial accelerations, individuals would perceive the resultant acceleration vector (GiA) as the vertical. However, when subjects are aligned on the GiA, {{an increase in the}} magnitude of GiA induced a lowering of the apparent visual horizon (i. e. “elevator illusion”). The main aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the contribution of body and egocentric perception in the <b>elevator</b> <b>illusion.</b> While being exposed to 1 G and 1. 3 G and aligned on the GiA acceleration, subjects (N = 20) were asked (1) to set a luminous target to the subjective horizon, (2) to set a luminous target on “straight ahead” position (egocentric task) and (3) to rotate a tilting tube to their subjective perception of body orientation. Results showed that increasing GiA lowered horizon and egocentric settings and induces a backward body tilt perception. Moreover, the <b>elevator</b> <b>illusion</b> can be expressed as the additive combination of two processes: one that is dependent on body tilt perception, and the other that is dependent on egocentric perception. Both misperceptions in hypergravity may be considered to be a consequence of excessive shearing of the otolith organs. However large inter-individual differences in body tilt perception were observed. This last result was discussed in terms of the contribution of extravestibular graviceptors...|$|E
40|$|Travelling {{on board}} of {{locomotion}} vehicles often induce sensorial stimulations which provoke perceptive illusions. These erroneous perceptions of body position were {{defined in the}} literature as spatial disorientation, which is principally considered as otolithic origin. In fact, during a forward sustained linear acceleration, the resultant of the imposed acceleration and gravity is no longer aligned with the gravitational vertical. As other physical accelerometer, the otolithic system cannot discriminate the acceleration of gravity from sustained inertial acceleration, and will perceive this resultant, defined as gravito-inertial acceleration (GiA), as the new vertical. <b>Elevator</b> and oculogravic <b>illusions</b> are listed among the most experienced behavioural effects. These illusions are defined as erroneous visual perception of object position in hypergravity environment. This thesis takes an interest in i) sensorial information cues involved in perceptive illusions in hypergravity, ii) interindividuals differences in the estimation of visual horizon, iii) the role of egocentric and exocentric references implicated in <b>elevator</b> and oculogravic <b>illusions.</b> Our results highlight: (1) the fundamental role of gravito inertial intensity in the visual horizon perception, (2) the coupled effect of body and visual egocentric perceptions in visual horizon estimation, (3) inter-individuals differences, due to the modulation of gravito-inertial intensity, explained by otolithic cues, (4) the contribution of somesthetic cues, in particular for oculogravic illusion. All of the studies referred in this thesis suggest a sensory approach in otolithic and somesthetic terms, {{as well as an}} individual approach for visual horizon perception...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel setup called VisuaLift Studio for {{developing}} virtual reality content with a motion platform that employs an ordinary elevator and augments the subjective movement of said <b>elevator</b> using sensory <b>illusion</b> of movement induced by vision. A prototype system of VisuaLift Studio {{consists of an}} elevator, an acceleration sensor, a microcontroller, a laptop PC, and a head-mounted display (HMD). The experiment demonstrates {{that it is possible}} to control the perceived direction of the elevator by providing optical flow through the HMD (visual stimulus), regardless of the real direction of the elevator (physical stimulus). On the other hand, comparing the intensity of subjective movement between the case of visual and physical stimuli and the case of only visual stimulus, the former exhibits significantly stronger sensation of movement, even in the case where the directions of both stimuli are inconsistent...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{combined}} effects of gravitational and optical stimulation on perceived target elevation, we independently altered gravitational-inertial force {{and both the}} orientation {{and the structure of}} a background visual array. While being exposed to 1. 0, 1. 5, or 2. 0 Gz in the human centrifuge at NASA Ames Research Center, observers attempted to set a target to the apparent horizon. The target was viewed against the far wall of a box that was pitched at various angles. The box was brightly illuminated, had only its interior edges dimly illuminated, or was kept dark. Observers lowered their target settings as Gz was increased; this effect was weakened when the box was illuminated. Also, when the box was visible, settings were displaced {{in the same direction as}} that in which the box was pitched. We attribute our results to the combined influence of otolith-oculomotor mechanisms that underlie the <b>elevator</b> <b>illusion</b> and visual-oculomotor mechanisms (optostatic responses) that underlie the perceptual effects of viewing pitched visual arrays...|$|E
40|$|Both {{gravitational}} {{and optical}} sources of stimulation combine {{to determine the}} perceived elevations of visual targets. The ways in which these sources of stimulation combine {{with one another in}} operational aeronautical environments are critical for pilots to make accurate judgments of the relative altitudes of other aircraft and of their own altitude relative to the terrain. In a recent study, my colleagues and I required eighteen observers to set visual targets at their apparent horizon while they experienced various levels of G(sub z) in the human centrifuge at NASA-Ames Research Center. The targets were viewed in darkness and also against specific background optical arrays that were oriented at various angles with respect to the vertical; target settings were lowered as Gz was increased; this effect was reduced when the background optical array was visible. Also, target settings were displaced in the direction that the background optical array was pitched. Our results were attributed to the combined influences of otolith-oculomotor mechanisms that underlie the <b>elevator</b> <b>illusion</b> and visual-oculomotor mechanisms (optostatic responses) that underlie the perceptual effects of viewing pitched optical arrays that comprise the background. In this paper, I present a mathematical model that describes the independent and combined effects of G(sub z) intensity and the orientation and structure of background optical arrays; the model predicts quantitative deviations from normal accurate perceptions of target localization under a variety of conditions. Our earlier experimental results and the mathematical model are described in some detail, and the effects of viewing specific optical arrays under various gravitational-inertial conditions encountered in aeronautical environments are discussed...|$|E
