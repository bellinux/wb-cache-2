He argues that repentance appears as a strong theme only in Luke, that repentance was John the Baptist's message, and that Jesus' ministry {{would not have been}} scandalous if the sinners he ate with had been repentant. According to Theissen and Merz, Jesus taught that God was generously <b>giving</b> <b>people</b> an opportunity to repent.|$|E

Soon they are stopped by the survivors, who were looking for food, but the griffins don't have any food {{so they have to}} {{distract}} them. They continue their journey only to find that the car has run out of gas. The griffins now have to walk to Natick just as they found new home, but Peter thinks that our main journey was Natick as Lois takes an apple and bites it while an old man plays the song. So they once again continue their journey after Lois throws the apple at him. They made to natick, but there is no factory.

Peter proclaims himself mayor, and Joe and Clevemire join him to form a ruling council. One year later, New Quahog has become a fresh new community, complete with houses and wells. Peter has successfully reigned as mayor despite many mistakes, such as <b>giving</b> <b>people</b> jobs picked out of a hat rather than based on the person's skills. However, when Brian points out how New Quahog is a peaceful place with no violence, Peter says that they are completely defenseless finds metal to make guns. Later stewie has transformed into an octopus, when lois tries put stewie on with the pajamas with a trap door on the back, he sprays with ink but misses it.

25|$|In Grant's {{two terms}} he {{strengthened}} Washington's legal capabilities to directly intervene to protect citizenship rights {{even if the}} states ignored the problem. He worked with Congress to create the Department of Justice and Office of Solicitor General, led by Attorney General Amos Akerman and the first Solicitor General Benjamin Bristow. Congress passed three powerful Enforcement Acts in 1870–71. These were criminal codes which protected the Freedmen's right to vote, to hold office, to serve on juries, and receive equal protection of laws. Most important, they authorized {{the federal government to}} intervene when states did not act. Grant's new Justice Department prosecuted thousands of Klansmen under the tough new laws. Grant sent federal troops to nine South Carolina counties to suppress Klan violence in 1871. Grant supported passage of the Fifteenth Amendment stating that no state could deny a man the right to vote on the basis of race. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1875 <b>giving</b> <b>people</b> access to public facilities regardless of race.|$|E
25|$|In King Henry III's long reign (1216–1272) the short-cross penny {{continued}} in use until 1247. By then, however, {{through no fault}} of the moneyers' there was a problem in that many of the coins in circulation were underweight. This was caused by the illegal practice of clipping silver {{off the edge of the}} coin, which was made easier by the cross on the reverse not extending to the rim thus <b>giving</b> <b>people</b> no clear indication of exactly how big the coin was supposed to be. In 1247 therefore, a new long-cross penny replaced the short-cross coin, which made it more obvious when the coin had been clipped. Apart from the change in the size of the cross, the rest of the design did not substantially change, and the long cross made it easy to cut the coin into halves or quarters for change. Because of the introduction of the new coinage it was necessary to reopen many of the old mints to supply sufficient coins. Short-cross Henry III pennies were minted at Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Durham, London, Winchester and York. Long-cross pennies were produced at Bristol, Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Carlisle, Durham, Exeter, Gloucester, Hereford, Ilchester, Lincoln, London, Newcastle, Northampton, Norwich, Oxford, Shrewsbury, Wallingford, Wilton, Winchester, and York.|$|E
25|$|Pets {{might have}} the ability to stimulate their caregivers, in {{particular}} the elderly, <b>giving</b> <b>people</b> someone to take care of, someone to exercise with, and someone to help them heal from a physically or psychologically troubled past. Animal company can also help people to preserve acceptable levels of happiness despite the presence of mood symptoms like anxiety or depression. Having a pet may also help people achieve health goals, such as lowered blood pressure, or mental goals, such as decreased stress. There is evidence that having a pet can help a person lead a longer, healthier life. In a 1986 study of 92 people hospitalized for coronary ailments, within a year 11 of the 29 patients without pets had died, compared to only 3 of the 52 patients who had pets. Having pet(s) was shown to significantly reduce triglycerides, and thus heart disease risk, in the elderly. A study by the National Institute of Health found that people who owned dogs were less likely to die {{as a result of a}} heart attack than those who didn’t own one. There is some evidence that pets may have a therapeutic effect in dementia cases. Other studies have shown that for the elderly, good health may be a requirement for having a pet, and not a result. Dogs trained to be guide dogs can help people with vision impairment. Dogs trained in the field of Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) can also benefit people with other disabilities.|$|E

In buildings, carbon monoxide detectors are usually installed around heaters and other equipment.

5000|$|Researchers have {{determined}} that romantic love is a complex emotion that {{can be divided into}} either passionate or companionate forms. Berscheid and Walster (1978) and Hatfield (1988) found that these two forms can co-exist, either simultaneously or intermittently. Passionate love is an arousal-driven emotion that often <b>gives</b> <b>people</b> extreme feelings of happiness, and can also <b>give</b> <b>people</b> feelings of anguish. Companionate love is a form that creates a steadfast bond between two <b>people,</b> and <b>gives</b> <b>people</b> feelings of peace. Scientists have described the stage of passionate love as [...] "being on cocaine," [...] since during that stage the brain releases the same neurotransmitter, dopamine, as when cocaine is being used.

500|$|Catholics {{believe that}} Jesus Christ is the [...] "Second Person" [...] of the Trinity, God the Son.

Christ, therefore, is understood as being both fully divine and fully human, including possessing a human soul. It is taught that Christ's mission on earth included <b>giving</b> <b>people</b> his teachings and providing his example for them to follow as recorded in the four Gospels. Jesus is believed to have remained sinless while on earth, and to have allowed himself to be unjustly executed by crucifixion, as sacrifice of himself to reconcile humanity to God; this reconciliation is known as the Paschal Mystery.

Constantine and Woodall hosted What Not to Wear until 2005 and became renowned for their tactile behaviour with the participants, direct advice, and frequently referring to breasts as tits which {{has become something of}} a trademark. Never one to hold back, a notorious moment arose when Constantine spontaneously pulled a female candidate's underwear down during filming as her knicker line was visible. Critics of What Not to Wear argued that the duo were too patronising to their subjects, a claim which they strongly disagree with. Constantine insists that their subjects [...] "see we have a genuine love of women. We love women and they can see that. Women just know."

After the Ivory Coast qualified for the 2006 World Cup, Drogba made a desperate plea to the combatants, asking them to lay down their arms, a plea which was answered with a cease fire after five years of civil war. Drogba later helped move an African Cup of Nations qualifier to the rebel stronghold of Bouake; a move that helped confirm the peace process. On 24 January 2007, Drogba was appointed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as a Goodwill Ambassador. The UNDP were impressed with his previous charity work and believed that his high-profile would help raise awareness on African issues. In September 2011, Drogba joined the Truth, Reconciliation and Dialogue Commission as a representative to help return peace to his home nation. His involvement in the peace process led to Drogba being named as one of the world's 100 most influential people by Time magazine for 2010. Drogba's charity work continued when, in late 2009, he announced he would be donating the £3million signing on fee for his endorsement of Pepsi {{for the construction of a}} hospital in his hometown of Abidjan.
