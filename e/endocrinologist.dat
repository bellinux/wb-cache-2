40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comBackground Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) commonly consult <b>endocrinologists</b> or gynaecologists {{and it is not}} known whether these specialty groups differ in their approach to management. Objective To compare the investigation, diagnosis and treatment practices of <b>endocrinologists</b> and gynaecologists who treat PCOS. Design and Setting A mailed questionnaire containing a hypothetical patient's case history with varying presentations − oligomenorrhoea, hirsutism, infertility and obesity − was sent to Australian clinical <b>endocrinologists</b> and gynaecologists in teaching hospitals and private practice. Results Evaluable responses were obtained from 138 <b>endocrinologists</b> and 172 gynaecologists. The two specialty groups differed in their choice of essential diagnostic criteria and investigations. <b>Endocrinologists</b> regarded androgenization (81 %) and menstrual irregularity (70 %) as essential diagnostic criteria, whereas gynaecologists required polycystic ovaries (61 %), androgenization (59 %), menstrual irregularity (47 %) and an elevated LH/FSH ratio (47 %) (all P-values < 0 · 001). In investigation, gynaecologists were more likely to request ovarian ultrasound (91 %vs. 44 %, P < 0 · 001) and <b>endocrinologists</b> more likely to measure adrenal androgens (80 %vs. 58 %, P < 0 · 001) and lipids (67 %vs. 34 %, P < 0 · 001). Gynaecologists were less likely to assess glucose homeostasis but more likely to use a glucose tolerance test to do so. Diet and exercise were chosen by most respondents as first-line treatment for all presentations. However, <b>endocrinologists</b> were more likely to use insulin sensitizers, particularly metformin, for these indications. In particular, for infertility, <b>endocrinologists</b> favoured metformin treatment whereas gynaecologists recommended clomiphene. Conclusions There is a lack of consensus between <b>endocrinologists</b> and gynaecologists in the definition, diagnosis and treatment of PCOS. As a consequence, women may receive a different diagnosis or treatment {{depending on the type of}} specialist consulted. Andrea J. Cussons, Bronwyn G. A. Stuckey, John P.

An interactive model of factors likely to influence the balance between the supply and demand of <b>endocrinologists</b> during the next 20 years was constructed. The model used data from a wide range of sources and was developed under the guidance of a panel of experts derived from sponsoring organizations of <b>endocrinologists.</b> We determined current and projected numbers and demographics of en-docrinologists in the U.

40|$|AbstractAimsTo {{describe}} {{the views of}} healthcare providers about starting insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes and to determine the specific {{factors that contribute to}} delay insulin initiation. MethodsTwo-phases observational descriptive study. In the quantitative phase we conducted a cross-sectional survey of a sample of 380 healthcare professionals (general practitioners (GPs), <b>endocrinologists,</b> internists and nurses). In the qualitative phase, a discussion group reviewed the results of the survey to propose solutions. ResultsIn poorly controlled patients, 46 % of GPs vs. 43. 2 % of internists and 31. 3 % of <b>endocrinologists</b> waited 3 – 6 months before starting insulin, and 71. 4 % of GPs vs. 66. 7 % of internists vs. 58. 8 % of <b>endocrinologists</b> need to confirm twice the HbA 1 c levels. The upper level of basal glucose more frequently considered as good control is 130 mg/dL for GPs (35. 7 %), and 120 mg/dL for internists (35. 8 %) and <b>endocrinologists</b> (37. 5 %). In patients without comorbidities, 32. 5 % of <b>endocrinologists</b> vs. 27. 2 % of internists vs. 17. 9 % of GPs initiated insulin when HbA 1 c was > 7 % while 26. 3 % of <b>endocrinologists</b> vs. 28. 4 % of internists vs. 38. 4 % of GPs initiated insulin when HbA 1 c was > 8 %. The interference of the therapy with the patient’ social life and the need for time management were the most accepted barriers to initiate insulin. ConclusionsThere are significant differences between GPs and <b>endocrinologists</b> regarding the insulin initiation and GPs and internists felt less empowered to manage patients with diabetes.

40|$|Background: Adrenal {{insufficiency}} is {{a common}} occurrence in the critically ill and {{it is essential that}} intensivists and <b>endocrinologists</b> involved in the care of these patients have a good understanding of the concepts related to this condition. Objectives: To assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices about adrenal insufficiency in the critically ill among the <b>endocrinologists</b> and intensivists practicing in the city of Chennai. Materials and Methods: Questionnaires containing ten questions pertaining to adrenal insufficiency in the critically ill were sent to a total of six <b>endocrinologists</b> and 52 intensivists practicing in Chennai. Results: About 77 &#x 0025; of all the respondents agreed to the fact that adrenal insufficiency is a frequent occurrence in critical illness. But 57 &#x 0025; of them felt that {{there is no need for}} routine evaluation of critically ill patients for adrenal insufficiency. Random serum cortisol was selected by 62 &#x 0025; of the responders as the method for evaluating adrenal function in the critically ill. There is clearly no agreement among the <b>endocrinologists</b> or the intensivists on the various cut off levels for diagnosis. Neither is there a clear consensus on the method followed for treatment of patients with adrenal insufficiency in the critical care unit. Conclusion: There is no concordance in the knowledge, attitudes or practices on adrenal insufficiency in the critically ill among the <b>endocrinologists</b> and intensivists in Chennai.
