The plant had large costs <b>freighting</b> their products across the sound on the Alvøy–Brattholmen Ferry. In 1958, he took the initiative to conduct a traffic count, which along with estimates of increased traffic from other places that had replaced a ferry with a bridge, would give estimates for the revenue from tolls. Norwegian Talc also paid for a draft plan for a bridge. In 1959, Iversen presented an estimate that a bridge would cost NOK15.5 million, and on 19 December 1959, the council voted unanimously to recommend that a committee be established to continue work on the bridge plans. In 1960, the bridge {{was included in the}} road plan for Hordaland.|$|E

50|$|<b>Freight</b> audit can be {{conducted}} at the shipment or <b>freight</b> invoice level. A company that has standard weights for standard packages may opt to audit <b>freight</b> invoices at <b>freight</b> invoice level to reduce complexity in the <b>freight</b> audit process. This is known as <b>freight</b> invoice validation and this process is simple as compared to a <b>freight</b> audit at shipment level. A company that has a more complex shipping process may choose to go for <b>freight</b> invoice verification. This <b>freight</b> invoice verification process is a flexible solution that allows the customer to use their shipment and package measurements and calculate against the <b>freight</b> quotes and finally compare against the <b>freight</b> invoice. By having detail shipment information, customers can analyze <b>freight</b> cost by product line reports or interface payment information into their ERP systems.|$|R

40|$|The {{fluctuation}} {{of shipping}} <b>freight</b> rates (<b>freight</b> rate risk) {{is an important}} source of market risk for all participants in the <b>freight</b> markets including hedge funds, commodity and energy producers.

A range of parametric and non-parametric VaR methods is applied to various popular <b>freight</b> markets for dry and wet cargoes. Backtesting is conducted in two stages by means of statistical tests and a subjective loss function that uses the Expected Shortfall, respectively. We find that the simplest non-parametric methods should be used to measure <b>freight</b> rate risk. In addition, <b>freight</b> rate risk is greater in the wet cargoes markets. The margins in the growing <b>freight</b> derivatives markets should be set accordingly.

25|$|Although the <b>freighting</b> {{business}} remained brisk and {{the cars}} were a favourite with travelers, they never turned a very large profit for the company. Although private operators could discontinue their services when the road conditions were poor, the BC Express Company had advertised automobile services in all weather conditions from May to October. Fulfilling that promise meant that a large crew of mechanics and drivers had to be kept on staff. In 1913, it cost the company $67,233 to maintain their fleet of 8 Wintons. The largest sum went for repairs, but $15,835.53 was spent on tires alone. Furthermore the total profits that were made that season was only $3,337.23, which the company believed was not a large figure considering the risk and investment involved.|$|E
25|$|Four other G 31s {{were sold}} for <b>freighting</b> cargo in New Guinea. Operated by Guinea Airways, one {{was owned by}} the airline itself, while the other three were owned by the Bulolo Gold Dredging Company. Powered by Pratt & Whitney Hornets, these {{differed}} from the G 31 airliners in having open cockpits, and a large hatch in the fuselage roof to accommodate the loading of bulky cargo via crane. In one particular operation, the G 31s were used to airlift eight 3,000tonne (3,310ton) dredges (in parts) from Lae to Bulolo. Three of the aircraft were destroyed in a Japanese air raid on Bulolo on 21 January 1942, and the remaining aircraft was pressed into RAAF service ten days later. This machine (construction number 3010, registration VH-UOW) was seriously damaged in an accident at Laverton, Victoria on 31 October that year after it careened off the runway and collided with and destroyed the Minister for Air's car. Although judged beyond repair by the Air Force, it eventually returned to freighter use in New Guinea for some time after the war.|$|E

[...] Thomas Jefferson Butcher was initially skeptical; but after his son had arranged to photograph 75 homesteads, he agreed to provide a team and wagon for the project.|$|E
