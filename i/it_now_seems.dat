5|$|The {{first major}} work to {{represent}} this new orthography was Elihu Doty's Anglo-Chinese Manual with Romanized Colloquial in the Amoy Dialect, published in 1853. The manual {{can therefore be}} regarded as the first presentation of a pre-modern POJ, a significant step onwards from Medhurst's orthography and different from today's system in only a few details. From this point on various authors adjusted some of the consonants and vowels, but the system of tone marks from Doty's Manual survives intact in modern POJ. John Van Nest Talmage has traditionally been regarded as the founder of POJ among the community which uses the orthography, although <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> that he was an early promoter of the system, rather than its inventor.|$|E

60|$|Wait, though! Something surely WAS {{stirring}} on the desert--something {{her eyes}} had not observed at first. <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> like a cloud; <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> like a spot of silver; <b>now</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to be a mass of rainbow colors that moved swiftly toward her.|$|R
25|$|This naming {{convention}} led to much {{confusion in the}} early 20th century, as scholars debated whether Teotihuacan or Tula-Hidalgo was the Tollan described by 16th-century chronicles. <b>It</b> <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> clear that Tollan may {{be understood as a}} generic Nahua term applied to any large settlement. In the Mesoamerican concept of urbanism, Tollan and other language equivalents serve as a metaphor, linking the bundles of reeds and rushes that formed part of the lacustrine environment of the Valley of Mexico and the large gathering of people in a city.|$|E
25|$|Leosthenes (Greek: Λεωσθένης; died 323 BC) was an Athenian who was {{commander}} of the combined Greek army in the Lamian War. Leosthenes is usually identified {{as the son of}} that Leosthenes who had suffered exile in 362/1 BC and who had fled to the court of Philip II. It is unknown by what means he had obtained the high reputation he had when he first makes his appearance in history. It has been generally inferred, from a passage in Strabo, that he had first served under Alexander the Great in Asia; but <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> certain that this is a mistake, and rather the reference should have been to Leonnatus.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the works}} which bear the names of Bakhtin's close friends V. N. Vološinov and P. N. Medvedev have been {{attributed}} to Bakhtin – particularly Marxism and Philosophy of Language and The Formal Method in Literary Scholarship. These claims originated in the early 1970s and received their earliest full articulation in English in Clark and Holquist's 1984 biography of Bakhtin. In the years since then, however, most scholars have come to agree that Vološinov and Medvedev ought to be considered the true authors of these works. Although Bakhtin undoubtedly influenced these scholars and may even have had a hand in composing the works attributed to them, <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> clear that if it was necessary to attribute authorship of these works to one person, Vološinov and Medvedev respectively should receive credit.|$|E
60|$|Lawyer Gooch {{passed his}} hand tremblingly across his brow. It was a {{habitual}} act with him, serving {{to clear his}} thoughts. Perhaps also <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>seemed</b> to soothe the spot where a very hard alligator-hide satchel had struck.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>now</b> <b>seemed</b> {{as if the}} {{revenge of}} the Otaheitans had been sated, for after the last tragic act they {{remained}} for some {{time in front of}} Brown's house talking, and resting their hands on the muzzles of their guns.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, the Islamic Welfare Party (Refah Partisi) entered Parliament, and the CHP's {{share of}} the vote dropped to 10% and it {{received}} only 49 of the 550 deputies. <b>It</b> <b>now</b> <b>seemed</b> as if the CHP had been replaced as the main left-wing party.|$|R
25|$|Zhou's diaries {{and letters}} from {{his time in}} Tokyo show a deep {{interest}} in politics and current events, in particular, the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Bolsheviks' new policies. He began to read avidly Chen Duxiu's progressive and left-leaning magazine, New Youth. He probably read some early Japanese works on Marx, {{and it has been}} claimed that he even attended Kawakami Hajime's lectures at Kyoto University. Kawakami was an important figure in the early history of Japanese Marxism, and his translations and articles influenced a generation of Chinese communists. However, <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> unlikely that Zhou met him or heard any of his lectures. Zhou's diaries also show his concern over Chinese student strikes in Japan in May 1918, when the Chinese government failed to send the students' scholarships, but he apparently was not deeply involved in the protest. His active role in political movements began after his return to China.|$|E
500|$|Domesday {{recorded}} {{an early}} church at Snitterley, but its location is unknown, {{and it may}} not have been the present site of St Nicholas. There are scheduled monument and Grade II listed ruins of a medieval building in the salt marshes north of the present town described as [...] "Blakeney Chapel", but, despite the name, <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> likely that this was a domestic dwelling rather than a religious edifice. Another possible chapel site east of the Glaven was shown on an 1835 map, but there is no documentation to support that identification.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1890 season, Dunlap engaged in {{protracted}} salary negotiations with President Nimick of the Alleghenies. In late March 1890, the Pittsburg Dispatch reported that the two sides had reached a resolution, [...] "and <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> certain that Dunlap will play his old position in the Pittsburg league club." [...] Nimick said at the time: [...] "I had a long talk with Mr. Dunlap, and we agreed to terms for him to play with us this season. [...] Of course the terms were below those of last year, that is, he will play for much less than $5,000. [...] He did not sign a contract, for reasons that were quite satisfactory to me ... We know he is a good player and he is quite willing to remain with us." ...|$|E

"Your view of Mr. Morris's conduct surprises me," [...] he replied--"surprises me {{more than}} I can say," [...] he added; remembering that he too was guilty of having kept her in ignorance of the truth, out of regard--mistaken regard, as <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>seemed</b> to be--for her peace of mind.|$|R

500|$|Some limited {{evidence}} has been found of activity {{on the site of}} Warburton dating from the Bronze Age, through the Iron Age and Roman periods; these include a flint blade, six Mesolithic tools, pieces of quernstone, and a snake bracelet. Archaeological evidence indicates that the area around Warburton has been used agriculturally since at least the Roman times. In the Domesday Book, the name was Warburgtune which name has evolved to today's 'Warburton'. The suffix –ton means a settlement or farmstead in Old English, indicating that the settlement has pre-Conquest origins. It has been suggested that Warburton was the site of an Anglo-Saxon burgh or defended settlement, possibly either called [...] "Toppingburgh" [...] orWeard byrig, established by Aethelflaed, Queen of the Mercians, in 915 during the wars with the Vikings. However, <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> likely that site lay on the Wales–Cheshire border.|$|E
500|$|After {{reading an}} article about the iLoo, Andrew Cubitt, {{inventor}} of the similarly named i-Loo, wrote to The Inquirer stating that iLoo [...] "sounds remarkably similar... <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> that the clever people at Microsoft have cottoned onto the idea and even call it the i-Loo, the same as mine!" [...] Cubitt {{went on to say that}} [...] "mine did everything that the Microsoft one is meant to do, but additionally printed information on toilet paper and didn't use a keyboard for the interface due to hygiene reasons". The i-Loo was prototyped by Cubitt as part of his thesis for his 2001 university degree in Product Design and Engineering at Brunel University. In an interview with The Inquirer, he noted [...] "As it was designed at the university, they own the partial rights to the product so they will be watching the Microsoft 'invention' very closely." ...|$|E
500|$|It was not {{initially}} {{clear to the}} medical community how many casualties and illnesses had been caused by the smog — or indeed, whether the smog had caused any casualties at all. The population of the area affected by the smog has been estimated at 16 million. A November 26 story by Jane Brody in the New York Times cautioned that it would likely take [...] "a month or more" [...] before investigators had enough data to assess whether the smog had caused any deaths. Three days later, after studying admissions to municipal hospitals for cardiac and respiratory complications, the city commissioner of hospitals Joseph V. Terenzio told the press [...] "I can report almost with certainty {{that there was no}} detectable immediate effect on morbidity and mortality because of the smog.... <b>It</b> <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> unlikely that final statistical analysis will reveal any significant impact on the health of New York City's population." [...] Early reports of injuries focused not on respiratory damage, but on car or boating accidents caused by poor visibility.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{these two}} in the supreme moment of their life saw each other, yet did not understand. A word, a touch would have given them both the key to one another's heart, and <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>seemed</b> as if death would part them for ever, whilst that great enigma {{remained}} unsolved.|$|R

500|$|The {{series has}} {{a score of}} 66 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on five reviews for season seven. In {{response}} to the season, Bianco from USA Today commented: [...] "Happily, <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> to have landed on solid ground." [...] Also of the seventh season, Entertainment Weeklys Jennifer Armstrong said: [...] "It's in the shooting's emotional reverberations that the show is regenerating after the past few hit-and-miss seasons," [...] whereas Verne Gay of Newsday commented: [...] "Unfortunately, they've settled on far-too-easy and facile answers for the most part." [...] HitFix gave a positive review saying that, [...] "season 7 overall {{has been one of}} the show's strongest ever." [...] and added, [...] "There was a time when Grey's Anatomy was this show where I suffered through a lot of stuff that made me cringe to get to those genius melodrama moments it could do so well. Over the last couple of years, it's evolved into a show that's much more consistent in tone, where it may not move me as often as it did in the early years but also very rarely makes me question my reasons for watching." [...] Speaking of season eight, Entertainment Weekly Mandi Bierly called it a [...] "so-so season", and Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter called it [...] "emotional". Also acknowledging the fan base Verne Gay of Newsday wrote [...] "Grey's has had a good season and has an intensely loyal fan base to prove it." [...] regarding the 8th season.|$|E

2500|$|For many years, {{a certain}} Tiaa was also {{accepted}} as a wife of Seti II and mother of Siptah. This {{was based on a}} number of funerary objects found in the tomb of Siptah bearing the name of Tiaa as King's Wife and King's Mother. However, <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> that these items washed into Siptah's tomb from the nearby tomb, KV32, as the result of an accidental breakthrough. [...] KV32 is the tomb of the wife of Thutmose IV, Tiaa.|$|E
60|$|Between {{them they}} bore the {{unconscious}} girl to her chamber, leaving Gregory to curse himself {{for having been}} lured into a confession that <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>seemed</b> to him had been unnecessary, since in his newly found vitality he realized that death was none so near a thing as that scoundrelly fool of a leech had led him to believe.|$|R

2500|$|It {{was until}} {{recently}} {{thought that the}} Maya may have adopted writing from the Olmec or Epi-Olmec culture, who used the Isthmian script. However, murals excavated in 2005 have pushed back the origin of Maya writing by several centuries, and <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> possible that the Maya {{were the ones who}} invented writing in Mesoamerica. Regardless, it is [...] that the Maya developed the only complete writing system in Mesoamerica, meaning that they were the only civilization that could write everything they could say.|$|E
2500|$|Brian Higgins and Hershel Parker {{characterize}} {{the novel as}} [...] "an ambitious experiment in psychological fiction" [...] whose primary focus is the [...] "complex workings of the human psyche," [...] especially the [...] "tortuous processes of distortion and self-deception involved in fervid states of mind combining religious exaltation and sexual arousal." [...] They comment that the novel also draws on the conventions of Gothic fiction. Andrew Delbanco added that Pierre long suffered from being {{in the shadow of}} Moby-Dick, but that [...] "with its themes of sexual confusion and transgression" [...] <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> [...] "fresh and urgent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} Normans began to enter Italy, {{they entered the}} Byzantine Empire and then Armenia, {{fighting}} against the Pechenegs, the Bulgars, and especially the Seljuk Turks. Norman mercenaries were first encouraged {{to come to the}} south by the Lombards to act against the Byzantines, but they soon fought in Byzantine service in Sicily. They were prominent alongside Varangian and Lombard contingents in the Sicilian campaign of George Maniaces in 1038–40. There is debate whether the Normans in Greek service actually were from Norman Italy, and <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> likely only a few came from there. It is also unknown how many of the [...] "Franks", as the Byzantines called them, were Normans and not other Frenchmen.|$|E
