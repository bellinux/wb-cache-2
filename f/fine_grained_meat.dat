40|$|AbstractLow cycle fatigue {{behavior}} of single phase polycrystalline aluminium and copper {{has been investigated}} under completely reversed strain-control condition. In both cases two different grain sizes have been considered. It is found that over the range of strain amplitude of 0. 20 to 1. 0 pct the cyclic life is low in case of coarse grained aluminium as compared to <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> condition. However, the cyclic stress response of coarse grained aluminium is completely {{different from that of}} <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> condition. In contrast to <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> aluminium cyclic hardening of coarse grained aluminium is found to occur in different stages for all strain amplitudes. The initial hardening is first stabilized and then increases by substantial amount. On the other hand, although the nature of variation of cyclic stress response with number of cycles is almost similar for both <b>fine</b> and coarse <b>grained</b> copper, the magnitude of hardening all through the cyclic life is more in case of coarse grained copper. This is attributed to higher twin density in case of coarse grained copper. However, the cyclic life in coarse grained copper is less as compared to <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> copper. Irrespective of cyclic hardening behavior and stacking fault energy it is found that cyclic life is more in case of <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> materials...|$|R

40|$|The new {{developed}} <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> mixed ceramic {{cutting tools}} demonstrate {{a significant increase}} of the tool life time in typical cutting operations like turning of hardened steel. Additionally {{it is possible to}} use these new cutting tools in machining operations with discontinuous cut. In manufacturing cutting tools grinding operations are used to create the cutting edges. Especially in grinding <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> ceramics is it necessary to achieve high precision cutting edges by using <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> grinding wheels. By developing the in-process sharpening with electro contact discharge it is possible to use <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> grinding wheel with a high material removal rates. The in-process sharpening processes eliminate the influence of the mechanisms of grinding wheel wear on the grinding process. Therefore with in-process sharpening it is possible to generate high precision cutting edges in economical grinding processes. (orig.)

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the kinetics research into the drying of <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> material in a two-component fluidized bed. A review of theoretical and experimental investigations of aerodynamics of the fluidized bed is given, with a special insight into two-component fluidized beds, as well as the basics of heat and material transfer through a fluidized bed. Apart from the theoretical basis of convective drying of wet materials in a stagnant fluidized bed, the paper also emphasizes different approaches to <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> material drying kinetics. Based on the experimental investigations, where zealots used as a representative of <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> material and polyethylene as a representative of inert material (another component), an analysis of the influence of working parameters on drying in a two-component fluidized bed is performed. It is established that, apart from the influence of the considered parameters, such as fluidization velocity, diameter of <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> material particles and drying agent temperature, on the drying curve, the participation of inert material can considerably increase the intensity of heat and material transfer in the fluidized bed. A comparison of the experimental drying curves of <b>fine</b> <b>grained</b> material in the two-component fluidized bed with the results from the studies by other authors shows satisfactory agreement...|$|R
