40|$|Irradiation of argon {{matrices}} at 12 K containing {{hydrogen peroxide}} and tetrachloroethene using the output from a medium-pressure mercury lamp {{gives rise to}} the carbonyl compound trichloroacetyl chloride (CCl 3 CClO). Similarly trichloroethene gives <b>dichloroacetyl</b> <b>chloride</b> (CCl 2 HCClO) - predominantly in the gauche form - under the same conditions. It appears that the reaction is initiated by homolysis of the O-O bond of H 2 O 2 to give OH radicals, one of which adds to the double bond of an alkene molecule. The reaction then proceeds by abstraction of the H atom of the hydroxyl group and Cl-atom migration. This mechanism has been explored by the use of DFT calculations to back up the experimental findings. The mechanism is analogous to that shown by the simple hydrocarbon alkenes...|$|E

Titanium dioxide is commonly used as photocatalyst and ultraviolet light is utilized for decomposing gas phase pollutants. In the present work, the photocatalytic oxidation of methyl tert butyl ether (MTBE) and trichloroethylene (TCE) in the gas phase was studied.

I n addition, the results of chronic bioassays of three previously untested com-pounds are described. Female ICR/Ha Swiss mice, 30 - 50 per group, were used in all tests. The test duration was 18 - 22 months. Diethylcarbamyl chloride (DECC), ethyl chloroformate (ECF), and <b>dichloroacetyl</b> <b>chloride</b> (DCAC) were tested by repeated skin application, in two-stage carcinogenesis with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) as pro-moter, and by repeated subcutaneous injection.

All three compounds showed marginally significant incidences of papillomas and carcinomas when tested as initiators. ECF and DCAC did not show skin tumorigenicity in the repeated skin application tests. DECC showed weak carcinogenicity compared to DMCC. Subcutaneous injection resulted in the same pattern of tumorigenicity. Thus, the four acylating agents showed the following decreasing order of carcinogenicity: DMCC> DECC> ECF 2 DCAC.

40|$|Kempane diterpenes such as 1 and 2, {{which are}} a class of compact tetracyclic {{compounds}} isolated from the defense secretions of nasute soldier termites, have been challenging synthetic targets. We have achieved a highly stereoselective synthesis of the kempane diterpene ring system that possesses all the required stereogenic centers and sufficient functionality to allow elaboration to 1 and 2. A key step of our synthesis of the ring system is the highly regia- and facially-selective Diels-Alder cycloaddition of cis- 5 -(I-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl) oxy) vinyl) - 3, 3 a, 6, 6 a-tetrahydro- 2 H-cyclopenta[b]furan- 2 -one (78) and 2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone (13) to establish the benzoindane ring system 79. The diene 78 was prepared through a sequence that contained a regiospecific [2 + 2] cycloaddition of 1 -methyl- 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene (38) with dichloroketene, generated in situ from <b>dichloroacetyl</b> <b>chloride</b> and triethylamine. Though attempts to cyclize the seven-membered ring in hemi-acetal 72 by aldol reaction were unsuccessful due to the difficulty in opening the five-membered hemi-acetal ring, the seven-membered ring was constructed by a regiospecific Dieckmann condensation in ethyl (1 α, 2 β, 4 α, 4 aβ, 6 β, 6 aα, 7 aβ, 10 aβ, 10 bα, 10 cα) - 2, 3, 4, 4 a, 5, 6, 6 a, 7, 7 a, 10, 10 a, 10 b, 10 c-tridecahydro- 4 -hydroxy- 6 -(2 -methoxyethoxy) methoxy- 2, 10 c-dimethyl- 9 -oxo- 1 Hbenz[6, 7]indeno-[2, 1 -b]furan-l-methylcarboxylate (131). The transformation of the benzoindane ring system 79 to carboxylate 131 involved a remarkably regio- and stereoselective addition of an acetylide to the apparently more hindered carbonyl in 79, a reductive cleavage of a γ-hydroxy group in an α,β-enone system, and a one-pot acid-promoted epimerization and double-bond isomerization. [...] To explore the possibility of modifying our synthesis of the kempane diterpene ring system to an asymmetric approach, we investigated the asymmetric [2 + 2] cycloadditions of enantiopure, L-menthoxy- and 1, 2 : 5, 6 -di-O-isopropyllidene-a-D-glucofuranoxy-substituted ketenes 174 and 185 with cyclopentadiene (175). [...] In {{the course of the}} synthetic study towards kempane diterpenes, an exiremely regia- and stereoselective reduction of the seemingly more hindered carbonyl in enedione 56 with lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminohydride or sodium borohydride was observed. Systematic study proved this observation to be general with non-bridged cyclic enediones. Both the regio- and stereoselectivities are due to a preference for axial attack by the reducing reagents. Among possible axial additions to the two carbonyls, only one approach is sterically allowed. It was also found that the combination of sodium borohydride and cerium trichloride, the Luche reagent, was a useful alternative reducing reagent. It either improved or completely reversed the regioselectivity...|$|E
