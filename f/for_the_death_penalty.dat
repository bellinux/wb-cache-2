5|$|After {{spending}} {{two months}} in Batna with Ehnni, the French ordered her to leave North Africa without explanation; as an immigrant, {{she had no choice}} but to comply. Ehnni requested permission from his military superiors to marry Eberhardt (which would have enabled her to stay), but his request was denied. She traveled to France in early May 1901, staying with Augustin and his wife and daughter in Marseille. In mid-June she was summoned back to Constantine to give evidence at the trial of her attacker, who maintained his statement that God had ordered him to kill Eberhardt, though expressed remorse towards her. Eberhardt said that she bore no grudge against Abdallah, forgave him, and hoped that he would not be punished. Abdallah received life imprisonment although the prosecutor had asked <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b> When the trial ended, Eberhardt was again ordered to leave the country. She returned to live with Augustin, working with him (disguised as a man) as a dock labourer. Eberhardt and Augustin's family lived in appalling poverty. Eberhardt's health deteriorated, and she repeatedly suffered from fevers. She attempted suicide while in Marseille, one of several unsuccessful attempts she would make over the course of her life. Eberhardt continued to write during this time, working on several projects including her novel Trimardeur.|$|E
