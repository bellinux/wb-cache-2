25|$|The metal–oxide–semiconductor <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistor</b> (MOSFET, MOS-FET, or MOS FET) {{is a type}} of <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistor</b> (FET). It has an {{insulated}} gate, whose voltage {{determines the}} conductivity of the device. This ability to change conductivity with the amount of applied voltage can be used for amplifying or switching electronic signals. A metal–insulator–semiconductor <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistor</b> or MISFET is a term almost synonymous with MOSFET. Another synonym is IGFET for insulated-gate <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistor.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Field-effect</b> <b>transistors</b> {{based on}} single {{nanowires}} of conducting polymers (i. e., polyaniline and polypyrrole) were fabricated and characterized. The 100 -nm-wide and 2. 5 -ím-long conducting polymer nanowire <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistors</b> were turned “on ” and “off ” by electrical or chemical signals. A large modulation in the electrical conductivity {{of up to}} 3 orders of magnitude was demonstrated {{as a result of}} varying the electrochemical gate potential of these nanowires. Single nanowire conducting polymer <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistors</b> show higher electrical performance than <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistors</b> based on conducting polymer nanowire electrode junctions and thin films in terms of their transconductance (gm) and on/off current (Ion/Ioff) ratio. Furthermore, the performance of single nanowires conducting polymer <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistors</b> was found to be comparable to the silicon nanowire <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistors.</b> These results imply {{that it is possible to}} tune the sensitivities of these conducting polymer nanowires by simple control of the electrolyte/liquid ion gate potentials. On the basis of these findings, we demonstrated the ability to tailor the sensitivities of sensors based on single conducting polymer nanowires...|$|R

As <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistors,</b> they even may not need a p–n junction, thus avoiding the p-type doping problem of ZnO.

The device performance of the p-channel C- 60 <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistors,</b> such as mobility, threshold voltage, and on/off ratio is varied {{in a controlled manner}} by changing doping concentration.

This thesis first {{describes the}} creation of basic ambipolar FETs before building on this knowledge to develop ambipolar as well as hole-dominated light emitting <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistors.</b> Ambipolar FETs using a diketopyrrolopyrrole-based copolymer were first investigated in this thesis. When gold electrodes were used, the devices could transport only holes. The charge injection was altered by changing the contacts to aluminium. The devices then were able to conduct both electrons and holes with maximum electron and hole mobilities of order 10 − 4 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1 and 10 − 3 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1 respectively. Light-emitting <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistors</b> were first studied using the model emissive polymer Super Yellow. Charge injection was studied by altering the electron-injecting contact.

25|$|The <b>field-effect</b> <b>{{transistor}}</b> (FET) is a transistor {{that uses}} an electric field {{to control the}} electrical behaviour of the device. FETs are also known as unipolar transistors since they involve single-carrier-type operation. Many different implementations of field effect transistors exist. Field effect transistors generally display very high input impedance at low frequencies. The conductivity between the drain and source terminals is controlled by an electric field in the device, which is generated by the voltage difference between {{the body and the}} gate of the device.|$|E
