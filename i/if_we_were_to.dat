This critique {{was in response to}} the knowledge that some European Jews of the period addressed individual sephirot in some of their prayers, although the practice was apparently uncommon.

25|$|Teeth (singular tooth) {{are small}} whitish {{structures}} {{found in the}} jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates {{that are used to}} tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, dentine and cementum. Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception. This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> bite into something too hard for our teeth, such as a chipped plate mixed in food, our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we stop trying.|$|E

25|$|However, {{in almost}} all cases we are {{involved}} in the world in an ordinary, and more involved, way. We are usually doing things with a view to achieving something. Take for example, a hammer: it is ready-to-hand; we use it without theorizing. In fact, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> look at it as present-at-hand, we might easily make a mistake. Only when it breaks or something goes wrong might we see the hammer as present-at-hand, just lying there. Even then however, it may be not fully present-at-hand, as it is now showing itself as something to be repaired or disposed, and therefore a part of the totality of our involvements. In this case its Being may be seen as unreadiness-to-hand. Heidegger outlines three manners of unreadiness-to-hand: Conspicuous (damaged; e.g., a lamp's wiring has broken), Obtrusive (a part is missing which is required for the entity to function; e.g., we find the bulb is missing), Obstinate (when the entity is a hindrance to us in pursuing a project; e.g., the lamp blocks my view of the computer screen).|$|E

[...] "Stormy Monday" [...] was performed in a [...] "club combo" [...] or West Coast-blues style with a small back-up band. [...] The style, as heard in [...] "Driftin' Blues" [...] (one of the biggest hits of the 1940s), evokes a more intimate musical setting than the prevailing jump-blues dance-hall style. [...] Accompanying Walker is pianist Lloyd Glenn, bassist Arthur Edwards, drummer Oscar Lee Bradley, and horn players John [...] "Teddy" [...] Bruckner (trumpet) and Hubert [...] "Bumps" [...] Myers (tenor saxophone). [...] A key feature of the song's instrumentation is Walker's prominent guitar parts, including the extensive use of ninth chords, which gives the song its distinctive sound. [...] Author Aaron Stang explained: [...] "The real sound of this riff is based on starting each 9th chord a whole step (2 frets) above and sliding down.

The producers were also denied a request to film at a Berlin police station by the department, citing adverse impact to the facility. The German government eventually {{had a change of heart}} concerning the Bendlerblock site and gave permission for filmmakers to film there. A United Artists spokesman said that they were [...] "very grateful" [...] for the decision, saying that the site [...] " [...] always been important to us symbolically, creatively and for the sake of historical authenticity" [...] and that the company had been in continuous talks with the German government in order to clear up any misconceptions about the nature of the film.

500|$|Wenger {{appointed}} Vieira as club captain following Adams' retirement, {{and made}} few additions to his double-winning squad, signing defender Pascal Cygan, midfielder Gilberto Silva and utility player Kolo Touré.

It wouldn't surprise me <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> go unbeaten {{for the whole of}} the season". Arsenal set a new top-flight record in their opening game of the 2002–03 season; a 2–0 victory against Birmingham City was their 14th league win in succession. They continued their fine start by overhauling Nottingham Forest's top-flight record of 22 away league matches without defeat and later surpassed Manchester United's Premier League total of 29 matches unbeaten. Arsenal lost to Everton in October 2002, which began a run of four matches without a win. Though Wenger's team built an eight-point lead over challengers Manchester United by March 2003, they were overhauled in the final weeks of the season. [...] The title race shifted in United's favour when Bolton Wanderers came from behind to draw 2–2 against Arsenal. Wenger showed moments of exasperation during the match by loosening his tie and bellowing orders from the touchline. Journalist Phil McNulty wrote that Wenger's demeanor [...] "spoke of someone who had the title in his grasp but now saw it slipping from his fingers". Arsenal beat Southampton 1–0 to retain the FA Cup {{at the end of the}} campaign.|$|E
