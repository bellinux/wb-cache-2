However, previous research has shown that <b>downsizing</b> seldom generates positive results at a macro or micro level. It has been demonstrated that <b>downsizing</b> has a negative impact on financial performance, such as Return on Assets, Return on Investments, and profits in the long-term. <b>Downsizing</b> also has a negative impact on the remaining workers left employed, referred to as the 2 ̆ 2 survivors 2 ̆ 2.

40|$|In China, orgnizational {{change and}} <b>downsizing</b> {{are the primary}} topics studied in I/O {{psychology}} and Human Resource Management. Due to the great need in reality, both theorists and practitioners raised the same questions: Does <b>downsizing</b> increase the organizational performance? What {{is the relationship between}} organizational <b>downsizing</b> strategies and survivors&# 39; psychological reations? Which factors influence managers&# 39; <b>downsizing</b> decision-making most? How can managers manage the process successfully? The {{purpose of this study is}} trying to answer these questions, and then to establish the <b>downsizing</b> decision-making model of China&# 39;s SOE (State owned enterprise) managers. The hypothetical model of SOE managers&# 39; <b>downsizing</b> decision-making was put forward, based on a tremendous amount of literature on <b>downsizing</b> decision-making, especially on the <b>downsizing</b> decision-making model built by B. Shaw, and also based on the results of the interviews conducted to the SOE managers who have the <b>downsizing</b> decision-making experiences. In order to test and verify the model, 322 SOE managers were investigated by a questionnaire study. And the statistic results supported the hypothetical <b>downsizing</b> decision-making model. Further, 259 survivors (those who are still working in the SOEs) from 7 <b>downsized</b> SOEs and 1 non-downsizing SOE, were also investigated by a questionnaire study. The statistic results also supported the hypothetical <b>downsizing</b> decision-making model. A subsequent case study was performed upon one <b>downsized</b> SOE; and a deliberate focus group interview study within 6 SOE mangers from another <b>downsized</b> SOE was also conducted. Both fundings from the two studies surported the hypothetical model again. Thus, China&# 39;s SOE managers&# 39; <b>downsizing</b> decision-making model was established. This China&# 39;s SOE managers&# 39; <b>downsizing</b> decision-making model suggests the following: Firstly, the characteristics of managers&# 39;downsizing decision-making were the center of the model. Those characteristics displayed during the process of the <b>downsizing</b> decision planning, the participation of <b>downsizing</b> decision-making and the communication concerning <b>downsizing</b> events, were influenced by managers&# 39; sense of crisis, controlling factors out of the organization and the managing experience within it. Especially, the latter two factors were more important. Secondly, in <b>downsizing</b> decision-making problems, the perceived crisis of China&# 39;s SOE managers was mainly influenced by the outer factors, esp. the controlling factors from the government or the high authorities, but not by the inner factors including manufacturing management, HRM skills and organizational competition strategies. Thirdly, survivors&# 39;psychological reactions (including job satisfaction, job motivation, team working cooperation, etc) were mainly influenced by the characteristics of the managers&# 39; <b>downsizing</b> decision-making, at the same time, also by the outer factors (including controlling and social security factors) and the inner factors (including competition strategy and HRM skills). Finally, according to the model and the results from this study, the conclusions were reached in the followings: The stronger the controlling effort upon the SOE managers, the worse the effect displayed during the <b>downsizing</b> process. And in order to improve the effect and quality of <b>downsizing</b> decision-making, SOE managers need a lot of training to ameliorate their competencies such as competition strategies and HRM skills. 本研究通过对于实施裁员的国有企业管理者的决策特征的影响因素及其对留岗者心理影响的系统探讨，在组织层面上建构国有企业管理者裁员决策特征模型，来考察组织内外环境因素如何影响管理者的危机知觉，进而影响其裁员决策的行为特征；在此基础上重点探索管理者的这些特征如何影响留岗员工的心理反应。本研究基于国内外企业裁员管理决策研究的已有成果，特别是基于B．shaw的裁员决策模型，提出了我国国有企业管理者裁员决策的假设模型，在对 28 名国有企业管理者和 20 名留岗职工访谈的基础上，完善了国有企业管理者裁员决策特征模型的基本因素。此后，通过对 322 名参与过裁员管理决策的国企管理者的问卷调查，初步验证了国有企业管理者的裁员决策模型；通过对裁员后企业的 259 名留岗职工的问卷调查，对 2 家裁员企业的案例分析和 6 名管理者的团体焦点访谈，从多层面、多角度验证了本研究提出的国有企业管理者裁员决策模型。本研究结果如下：第一、我国国有企业管理者在裁员决策过程中的应对反应特征(方案制定、决策参与和裁员沟通) 主要受组织外部制约因素(上级指令、政策规定和社会保障等) 和内部管理因素(生产管理、团体维系和竞争策略) 的影响；第二、组织外部的制约因素(主要是上级指令、政策规定等控制因素) 影响管理者的危机知觉(威胁知觉和时间压力) ，而管理者的危机知觉则进一步影响其裁员决策特征，即裁员决策的应对反应特征；第三、留岗职工的心理反应(工作激励、团体精神、工作满意度和待遇满意度等) 主要受管理者裁员决策的应对反应特征的影响，但同时还受到组织内部竞争策略、团体维系等管理因素和社会保障等外部环境因素的影响；第四、没有发现组织内部的管理因素(生产管理、团体维系和竞争策略) 对管理者的危机知觉的影响...|$|R

40|$|While {{there is}} an {{extensive}} body of work on how organizational routines emerge and evolve over time, there is a scarcity of research on what happens when routines are disrupted or disbanded through the elimination of key individuals involved in them. This study {{is the first to}} theorize and empirically examine the relationship between the magnitude of workforce <b>downsizing</b> and firm performance applying an organizational routine perspective. Consistent with prior research on organizational routines, we posit that small-scale <b>downsizing</b> leads to efficiency improvements without disrupting the existing routines. While larger routine disruptions occur in both medium- and large-scale <b>downsizing,</b> we further argue and find that large-scale <b>downsizing</b> tends to be more beneficial than medium-scale <b>downsizing.</b> Building on prior research on routines, we reason that in medium-scale <b>downsizing</b> employees try to salvage the impaired, partially functioning routines, while large-scale <b>downsizing</b> requires a more fundamental rethinking and re-creation of routines leading to more positive outcomes. Our study contributes to <b>downsizing</b> research through the application of the organizational routine perspective to explain the financial outcomes of <b>downsizing.</b> In doing so, we depart from the widely held assumption in the <b>downsizing</b> literature that the relationship between the magnitude of <b>downsizing</b> and firm performance is linear.

40|$|Even {{after three}} decades, organisations {{worldwide}} have continued {{the practice of}} <b>downsizing.</b> Interestingly, {{the reasons for the}} differences in leaders 2 ̆ 7 approaches to <b>downsizing</b> still remain unclear. This study therefore, was primarily driven by the central research question: Why would leaders differ in their approaches to <b>downsizing?</b> Within the <b>downsizing</b> literature, the role of some internal factors (e. g. mutual trust, team composition and structure, managerial ideologies) has been analysed and that of others (e. g. dynamic managerial capabilities) has been alluded to, without being followed up by actual research. However, the systematic links between <b>downsizing</b> strategies, and leaders 2 ̆ 7 characteristics and organisational culture have not been empirically established to date, and this study applies the initiative to such efforts. In order to answer the central research question, the present study was conducted under two premises, viz. ideal and practical. Under ideal conditions, the intent was to identify the ideal <b>downsizing</b> strategy types and subsequently the leaders 2 ̆ 7 characteristics and organisational culture dimensions, so as to determine which leaders 2 ̆ 7 characteristics and organisational culture dimensions are favourable for which ideal <b>downsizing</b> strategy type. However, under practical conditions, the intent was to identify the practical <b>downsizing</b> strategy types and only organisational culture dimensions, so as to determine which cultural dimension is favourable for which practical <b>downsizing</b> strategy type. The research data was gathered from 255 mid-level leaders in ten publicly-funded Australian universities through a postal survey, and then analysed using exploratory factor analysis, cluster analyses and one-way ANOVAs. Ideally and practically, three types of <b>downsizing</b> strategies were identified.;Based on these, four clusters were derived and analysed methodically across personality, leadership styles, personal values, and organisational culture. Empirical evidence suggests that leaders who ideally prefer forced <b>downsizing</b> have a higher tendency to make their attitudes clear to the team members - a characteristic of high task-oriented style; leaders who prefer voluntary <b>downsizing</b> have a lower tendency to make their attitudes clear to the team members - a characteristic of low task-oriented style; leaders who prefer student load <b>downsizing</b> have a lower tendency to act with consulting their team - a characteristic of low people-oriented style; leaders who prefer a very limited <b>downsizing</b> have a higher tendency to act with consulting their team - a characteristic of high people oriented style. However, personality, personal values, and organisational culture dimensions are not differentiated by the leaders who prefer different ideal <b>downsizing</b> strategies and also those who prefer a very limited <b>downsizing.</b> Furthermore, leaders who use a forced <b>downsizing</b> tend to have a culture that is less likely characterised by a personal freedom; leaders who use voluntary <b>downsizing</b> tend to have a culture that is less likely characterised by sociable and trusting; leaders who use a very limited <b>downsizing</b> tend to have a culture that is more likely characterised by a personal freedom, sociable and trusting. Interestingly, organisational culture dimensions are not differentiated by the leaders who use student load <b>downsizing.</b> This research makes following three key contributions to the theory and practice of <b>downsizing.</b> First, it has advanced empirical typologies of ideal and practical downsizing; second, it has developed empirical model of differences in approaches to ideal downsizing; third, it has developed empirical model of differences in approaches to practical downsizing.;The present research has addressed a gap in the <b>downsizing</b> literature concerning characteristics of leadership styles and organisational culture as explanatory factors for the differences in approaches to <b>downsizing.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Around {{the turn}} of the century, China {{experienced}} perhaps the largest labour restructuring program in the world. This paper uses a new dataset of Chinese industrial enterprises to examine what leads to <b>downsizing,</b> and tries to understand the effects of labour <b>downsizing</b> on firms' technical efficiency, financial performance and employee wages. We find that <b>downsizing</b> is more prevalent in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and is more likely when enterprises are older, larger and have higher excess capacity. For both SOEs and private firms, <b>downsizing</b> is more likely when the prices of their products drop, but private firms respond more dramatically. Moreover, <b>downsizing</b> has serious short-term costs in terms of total factor productivity (TFP). For mild <b>downsizing,</b> private firms suffer more deterioration in productivity. The distribution of surplus after <b>downsizing</b> is more favourable to labour in SOEs. For severe <b>downsizing,</b> both SOEs and private firms exhibit lower TFP growth with similar magnitudes. Our findings imply that private firms emphasize profit goals, while SOEs place a greater weight on labour protection. Copyright (c) 2008 The Authors. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} survivor reactions to a <b>downsizing</b> and retention subsequent to a <b>downsizing.</b> We hypothesize that survivors who experience the <b>downsizing</b> as distributively, procedurally, and interactionally just and who see top management as trustworthy will feel more attached to the organization because each reduces the threat inherent in <b>downsizing.</b> In addition, we hypothesize that survivors who feel empowered will also feel more attached to the organization because they feel better {{able to cope with}} the <b>downsizing.</b> We further hypothesize that those survivors who feel more attached to the organization following the <b>downsizing</b> {{will be more likely to}} remain with the organization in the coming year. The theoretical model is tested on a sample of aerospace employees who survived an organizational <b>downsizing.</b> The trustworthiness of management, distributive justice, procedural justice, and three dimensions of empowerment are found to facilitate more organizational attachment. Higher levels of attachment are found, in turn, to facilitate less voluntary turnover in the year following the <b>downsizing.</b> Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
