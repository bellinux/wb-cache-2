Over the next 13 years, {{he served in}} <b>instructional</b> <b>and</b> command positions. He took over command of the 49th Pursuit Group in December 1941 and between March 1942 and January 1943, his fighters downed 78 enemy aircraft {{in the defense of}} Darwin in northern Australia, against Japanese air attacks. In 1943 he assumed command of the V Fighter Command, part of Major General George Kenney's Fifth Air Force. In 1945, he commanded the Thirteenth Air Force in the Southern Philippines and Borneo campaigns. After the war Wurtsmith served with the Strategic Air Command.|$|E
5|$|Air Vice Marshal Ian Dougald McLachlan, CB, CBE, DFC (23 July 1911– 14 July 1991) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Born in Melbourne, he was a cadet at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, before joining the Air Force in December 1930. After serving in <b>instructional</b> <b>and</b> general flying roles, he took command of No.3 Squadron in December 1939, leading it into action in the Middle East {{less than a year}} later. Awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, he returned to Australia in 1942 to command air bases in Canberra and Melbourne. The following year he was posted to the South West Pacific, where he led successively Nos.71 and 73 Wings. Having been promoted to group captain, he took charge of Southern Area Command in 1944, and No.81 Wing in the Dutch East Indies the following year.|$|E
5|$|Included {{were nine}} Australians—three {{officers}} and six sergeants—who {{had been selected}} by AIF Headquarters in April 1918. All were experienced soldiers, with three having served at Gallipoli {{as well as in}} France. Sailing on the SS City of Marseilles on 17 June 1918 the Australians arrived in Murmansk and most were immediately sent out on patrol. Later they were switched to the Archangel section. The men were then broken into small advisory groups and attached to White Russian and White Finnish units, being engaged in a range of administrative, <b>instructional</b> <b>and</b> advisory tasks. Due to their isolation, it is difficult to make generalisations about the nature of service experienced by the Australians at this time. Captain P.F. Lohan served in a variety of administrative positions both in Murmansk and Archangel, whilst Sergeant R.L. Graham was commissioned in the field and became railway transport officer on the Archangel-Vologda railway. Several other sergeants were involved in the various training roles, while Captain Allan Brown was attached to the North Russian Rifles based at Onega—a White Russian battalion.|$|E

5|$|No. 5 OTU was re-formed at Williamtown on 1April 1970 {{to provide}} pilots with {{operational}} training {{prior to their}} conversion to the Dassault MirageIII fighter. The unit's reactivation was celebrated with a dinner attended by its original commanding officer, Bruce Rose, and a flypast of forty-nine aircraft from No.2 Operational Conversion Unit (OCU). No.5 OTU was divided into <b>instructional</b> <b>and</b> operational flights, and conducted training in concert with Mirages from No.2 OCU and No.76 Squadron. Its aircraft also participated in joint exercises and display flights, including air shows celebrating the RAAF's 1971 golden jubilee. The unit was equipped with forty CAC Sabre jet fighters, some de Havilland Vampire jet trainers, and eight Macchi MB-326s previously operated by No.2 OCU for lead-in fighter training. Vampire operations began winding down in September 1970, and the type was withdrawn in April 1971.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{maintaining}} its training program, No.1 OTU {{was required to}} periodically release instructors, students and aircraft for maritime patrols to protect Australian shipping lanes. In April 1943, six Hudsons were attached to No.32 Squadron at Camden, New South Wales, for convoy escort and anti-submarine duties. A year later, four Beauforts were deployed to Mount Gambier, South Australia, {{to carry out a}} two-day escort for the Dutch transport ship Van Ruys. Beauforts from No.1 OTU were also ordered to locate and destroy the German U-Boat U-862, which had shelled the Greek tanker Illosis off Kingston, South Australia, on 9December 1944. Although the submarine was not sunk, it was apparently frightened off by the presence of the Beauforts and aircraft from other RAAF units in the vicinity. No.1 OTU's intensive training regime included night flying, so that it operated almost round the clock. Flying effort reached a peak in August 1944, when 132 aircraft made 2,479 flights, instructing 221 students. The unit had by this time logged over 100,000 flying hours. It trained a total of 2,150 aircrew on Beauforts during the war, and suffered 147 aircraft accidents on <b>instructional</b> <b>and</b> operational fights in Australia and New Guinea, resulting in the loss of 131 aircrew killed or missing. Post-war demobilisation saw the disbandment of all the RAAF's operational training units; No.1 OTU was dissolved in December 1945.|$|E
5|$|With Petre {{on active}} duty, Harrison {{took on the}} main {{responsibility}} for providing basic flying training to the pilots {{of the first three}} squadrons to be formed in Australia for overseas service. Many of his students would go on to play a prominent role in the future Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), including Bill Anderson, Harry Cobby, Adrian Cole, Frank McNamara, Lawrence Wackett, and Henry Wrigley. Having graduated twenty-four new pilots by the end of 1915, Harrison was able to establish the first AFC squadron, designated No.67 (Australian) Squadron, Royal Flying Corps; it was however commonly known as No.1 Squadron AFC from its inception, and officially so from 1January 1918. The unit departed for Egypt in March 1916 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel E.H. Reynolds. Nos. 3 and 4 Squadrons AFC were formed at Point Cook in late 1916 to operate in France following advanced training in England. In addition to his <b>instructional</b> <b>and</b> administrative duties, Harrison put his mechanical abilities to use initiating the building of aero engines in Australia and maintaining the CFS's complement of airframes; according to Wackett, only Harrison had the skill to keep the obsolescent machines in the air. He was appointed officer-in-charge of CFS in June 1917 with the temporary rank of major; this was made permanent in September 1918. The CFS was disbanded at Point Cook on 31December 1919.|$|E

A second legend is that the contractor accidentally swapped the tower drawings after having had too much to drink. Although the southern tower was designed with clock faces, it never held a working clock until October 2005.
