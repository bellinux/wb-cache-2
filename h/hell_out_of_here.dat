5000|$|Six {{weeks before}} his 18th birthday, Kennedy {{enlisted in the}} United States Naval Reserve as a Seaman Apprentice, but was {{released}} from active duty until March 1944 when he left Milton Academy early {{to report to the}} V-12 Navy College Training Program at Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His V-12 training occurred at Harvard (March-November 1944), Bates College in Lewiston, Maine (November 1944-June 1945), where he graduated with a specialized V-12 degree along with 15 others,) and Harvard once again (June 1945-January 1946). While at Bates College, Kennedy wrote a letter to David Hackett in which he expressed feelings of inadequacy and frustration at being isolated from the action, talked of filling his free time taking classes with other sailors and remarked that [...] "things are the same as usual up here, and me being my usual moody self I get very sad at times." [...] He added, [...] "If I don't get the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> soon I'll die." [...] Aside from Hackett, who was serving as a paratrooper, more of his Parker Hall dorm mates went overseas and left him behind. With others entering combat before him, Kennedy said this made him [...] "feel more and more like a Draft Dodger (sic) or something". He was also frustrated with the apparent desire to shirk military responsibility by some of the other V-12 students.|$|E

40|$|The two English constructions {{exemplified}} in Let 2 ̆ 7 s get the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> (type G) and They beat {{the hell out}} of him (type B) differ both syntactically and semantically, but in both the taboo expression has the force of an intensifier. History (through a corpus investigation) reveals that the B-construction started as a literal exorcism (beat the devil out of someone), where the hell substituted for the devil, and semantic bleaching ultimately made the literal sense give way to simple emphasis, with any taboo term jumping in. The G-construction may have developed simultaneously, always as an intensifier [...] or, perhaps, later, on analogy with B. Our analysis suggests that the use of taboo terms as intensifies spread from wh-constructions to these constructions and, finally, to degree intensifier constructions. These two uses of taboo terms as intensifies are best characterized in terms of constructions and thus offer evidence against theories lacking any notion of constructions as basic building blocks. Further, they give us information about language change: a pragmatically unified but semantically disparate class of expressions (namely, taboo terms) can extend its distribution in parallel...|$|E
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} show that NSM {{techniques}} of semantic and pragmatic analysis allow an integrated semantic-pragmatic approach {{to the use of}} "swear words" and "curse (cuss) words". The paper begins with a lexical semantic exegesis of the lexical items swear word and curse word. This is helpful to delimit and conceptualise the phenomena being studied, and it also hints at some interesting differences between the speech cultures of Australian English and American English. Subsequent sections propose semantic explications for a string of swear/curse words and expressions as used in Australian English, including: exclamations (Shit! Fuck! Damn! Christ! Jesus!), abuse formulas (Fuck you!, Damn you!), interrogative and imperative formulas (e. g. Who the fuck do you think you are?; Get the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here!),</b> and the free use of expressive adjectives, such as fucking and goddamn, in angry swearing. A novel aspect of these explications, with interesting implications for the relationship between semantics and pragmatics, is the proposal that the explications incorporate a Metalexical Awareness section, modelling speaker awareness of the particular words being used and ethno metapragmatic knowledge about their status in the community of discourse. The study goes on {{to address the issue of}} so-called social or conversational swearing. I propose cultural scripts to capture some Anglo ethnopragmatic assumptions about how the use of swear/curse words can be affected by perceptions of familiarity, solidarity, and mutuality. Differences between Australian English and American English in the use of swear/curse words expressions, and in attitudes towards such use, are discussed briefly. Overall, the study seeks to show how semantic explications and cultural scripts can work together to produce an integrated and explanatory account of a speech phenomenon which stands at the crossroads of pragmatics, semantics, and sociolinguistics.
