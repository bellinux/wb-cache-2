In other parts of the project, a simulation method for combined welding and heat treatment simulations of the component was developed and different plastic/viscoplastic material models have been compared, these models included effects of phase changes. These simulations were made using an axisymmetric finite element model. The current paper presents welding and heat treatment simulations of the same aerospace component but now using a three-dimensional shell model. The results are compared with the previously used axisymmetric model. The simulations revealed that the two first welds have the greatest influents on a 'key dimension'.

Accordingly,it is more efficient to conduct performance and effectiveness assessment of the pulse detonation module using the existing test rigs, modified to partially simulate flight conditions comprising: a platform with the studied gas turbine engine (GTE), a power plant on a movable platform, pressurization system pipeline from an auxiliary power unit (APU) to the test engine, fuel and electrical systems of the test rig.

40|$|This {{project was}} carried out at Sandvik Coromant in Sandviken. The {{objective}} was to investigate how the machining dynamics was influences by the workpiece and different positions of the fixtures. The project consisted of two parts: investigation of one simple beam model to gain {{knowledge and understanding of}} the problem and secondly: study of alternative clamping positions for a jet engine turbine <b>exhaust</b> <b>case.</b> For both cases natural frequencies, mode shapes, frequency response functions and machining stability was investigated. For the beam model the natural frequency changes resulting from machining were found to have specific patterns which were dependent on the boundary conditions. The changing natural frequencies were reflected on to the stability lobes. In order to maximize the production rate the spindle speed should be altered to natural frequencies changes. The natural frequencies can change considerably when the beam cross section is machined down. The mode shapes of the beam is however fairly unchanged. This makes it possible to choose a good position of an additional support based on knowledge of the original beam. A position of an additional support at a node point for a particular mode maximizes the natural frequency for the mode one number lower. A position of the support near the middle of the beam minimizes the highest flexibility that occurs and also maximizes the first natural frequency for a prismatic beam. For the jet engine casing six lower and six upper clamping sections with a 30 degree phase shift was found to have both the highest first natural frequencies and the highest machining stability limits of the investigates cases. Locking the casing in three symmetrically positioned sections of its lower flange gives the lowest first natural frequencies, of the investigated cases, followed by six sections and twelve sections.

40|$|Manufacturing of {{aero engine}} {{components}} requires attention to residual stress and final {{shape of the}} product in order to meet high quality product standards. This sets very high demands on involved manufacturing steps to meet design requirements. Simulation of manufacturing processes can therefore be animportant tool to contribute to quality assurance. The focus in this work is on simulation of a manufacturing process chain comprising of sheet metal forming, welding and a stress relief heat treatment. Simulation of sheet metal forming can be used to design a forming tool design that accounts for the material behaviour, e. g. spring back, and avoid problems such as wrinkling, thinning and cracking. Moreover, the simulation can also show how the material is stretched and work hardened. The residual stresses after forming may be of local character or global depending on the shape that is formed. However, the heat affected zone due to welding is located near the weld. The weld also causes large residual stresses with the major component along the weld. It is found that the magnitude of the residual stresses after welding is affected by remaining stresses from the previous sheet metal forming. The final stress relieve treatment will relax these residual stresses caused by e. g. forming and welding. However, this causes additional deformations. The main focus of this study is on how a manufacturing process step affects the subsequent step when manufacturing a component of the nickel-based super alloy 718. The chosen route and geometry is a simplified leading edge of an <b>exhaust</b> <b>case</b> guide vane. The simulations were validated versus experiments. The computed deformations were compared with measurements after each manufacturing step. The overall agreement between experiments and measurement was good. However, not sufficiently accurate considering the required tolerance of the component. It was found from simulations that the residual stresses after each process affects the subsequent step. After a complete manufacturing process chain which ends with a stress relief heat treatment the residual stresses were not negligible. VIII Special experiments were performed for studying the stress relief in order to understand how the stresses evolve through the heat treatment cycle during relaxation. It was found that the stresses were reduced already during the beginning of the heating up sequence due to decreasing Young´s modulus and yield stress with increasing temperature. Relaxation due to creep starts when a certain temperature was reached which gave a permanent stress relief...|$|E

40|$|The {{assembly}} and tack welding of jet engine turbine <b>exhaust</b> <b>cases</b> (TEC) {{is a complex}} and time consuming operation currently performed manually at Volvo Aero Norway. The assembly tolerances are very tight with a maximum alignment offset of 0. 7 mm. The company wants to investigate the possibility ofa complete or partial automation of this process. A test cell developed for studying the possibility of automating the {{assembly and}} tack welding operations of TEC components is presented. The test cell assembles TEC components using a control algorithm that combines high accuracy sensor measurements with an iterative stepwise alignment process performed bya robot. This test cell has been physically implemented and used for verifying the developed methodology. The equipment used in the test cell is specified in the thesis. The test cell consists of two industrial robots, fixtures and a high accuracy laser sensor. The laser sensor is mounted on the tool flange of one robot; the other robot is fitted with a specially designed gripper for performing the adjustment operation. A modular fixture system has also been developed focusing on flexibility and simplicity. A developed control algorithm that coordinates the different operations performed by {{the elements of the}} test cell is presented. This control algorithm is implemented using the Python programming language; the implementation is described in detail. The test cell assembly operation is based on the alignment of certain points on the components such that the offset is within tolerances. The iterative stepwise alignment process is described, including an operation for orienting the sensor for minimizing the offset measurement error. Once the points are aligned, the test cell simulates the tack welding operation. Multiple tests have been performed in order to verify the test cell’s capability of aligning the components within tolerances. These tests have shown positive results for assessment of the automation of the current process. To conclude, this thesis describes the developed test cell in detail. This includes the equipment used, the developed control algorithm, as well as multiple tests which confirm the test cell’s capability of aligningthe TEC components within tolerances. A valid methodology for robotic tack welding is also presented. Different studies for further development of the automation are finally proposed. </p...|$|R
