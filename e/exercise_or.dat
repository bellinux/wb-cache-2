5|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{is one of}} the few {{brain regions}} where new neurons are generated. This process of neurogenesis is confined to the dentate gyrus. The production of new neurons can be positively affected by <b>exercise</b> <b>or</b> negatively affected by epileptic seizures.|$|E
5|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is also known}} as ischemic heart disease, is caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the inner walls of the arteries which narrows them, reducing the blood flow to the heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during <b>exercise</b> <b>or</b> at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the heart muscle, causing unstable angina or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.|$|E
5|$|Slaves {{had special}} sexual {{restrictions}} and obligations. For example, a slave could not engage free boys in pederastic relationships ("A slave {{shall not be}} the lover of a free boy nor follow after him, or else he shall receive fifty blows of the public lash."), and they were forbidden from the palaestrae ("A slave shall not take <b>exercise</b> <b>or</b> anoint himself in the wrestling-schools."). Both laws are attributed to Solon. Fathers wanting to protect their sons from unwanted advances provided them with a slave guard, called a paidagogos, to escort the boy in his travels.|$|E

5|$|The brain consumes up {{to twenty}} percent of the energy used by the human body, more than any other organ. Brain {{metabolism}} normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source, but during times of low glucose (such as fasting, endurance <b>exercise,</b> <b>or</b> limited carbohydrate intake), the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose. The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise. Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies. However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells. The brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen, albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle.|$|E
5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or <b>exercise</b> <b>or</b> being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, may also help calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E
5|$|Several imaging {{methods can}} be used to assess the anatomy and {{function}} of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, CT scans, MRI and PET. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest ("transthoracic") or by a probe in the esophagus ("transoesophageal"). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, whether there is any backflow of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole, including an ejection fraction, which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume). Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances when the body is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac stress test involves either direct <b>exercise,</b> <b>or</b> where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as dobutamine.|$|E

25|$|Malignant {{hyperthermia}} is {{a disorder}} {{that can be}} considered a gene-environment interaction.

In rare cases, the biological stresses of physical <b>exercise</b> <b>or</b> heat may be the trigger.|$|E
