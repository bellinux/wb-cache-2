40|$|Purpose: One {{difficulty}} with Descemet’s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) is air management during surgery and <b>donor</b> endothelial lamella <b>centering.</b> We evaluated the no-touch technique for <b>donor</b> <b>centering</b> {{and the use}} of a newly developed DSAEK donor adjuster. Methods: We evaluated the records of 12 consecutive patients (mean age 75. 3 years) with bullous keratopathy who had undergone DSAEK. In all cases, the no-touch technique was attempted first. When the no-touch technique failed, a DSAEK donor adjuster with a 30 -gauge cannula resembling a curved reverse Sinskey hook was used for <b>donor</b> <b>centering.</b> The adjuster allows air injection during <b>donor</b> <b>centering.</b> Results: The no-touch technique using simple corneal surface massage to center the graft was successful in 4 cases (33. 3 %), while 4 cases required ocular tilting (33. 3 %) in addition to corneal surface massage. The no-touch technique was ineffective in 4 cases (33. 3 %), but the donor adjuster was used successfully and easily for these patients. Comparing the endothelial cell loss rate between the no-touch technique group and the donor adjuster group, {{there was no significant difference}} at 6 months. Conclusions: The no-touch technique was useful for better control of DSAEK <b>donor</b> <b>centering</b> in most cases. When the no-touch technique was ineffective, the DSAEK donor adjuster was uniformly successful...|$|R

40|$|The laser – induced <b>donor</b> <b>centers</b> in p-Insb {{have been}} studied by magneto-concentration effect (MCE). The {{distribution}} of <b>donor</b> <b>centers</b> in the nonequilibrium temperature field in InSb was obtained by redistribution of the interstitial In atoms (IIn) and vacanciens VIn under laser action. Comparison of the theoretical calculation and experimental data showed that depth δ {{of the position of}} p-n junction increased with temperature, and that relatively large value of δ at used value of laser intensity (Р ~ 3. 5 MW/cm²) is connected with presence of liquid phase during laser annealing process. Obtained results correlate with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements. Experiments were performed on p-InSb samples in the temperature range 180 – 290 K. Temperature gradient was provided by YAG: Nd laser illumination (l = 0. 53 µm, t = 15 ns).

40|$|The first subject {{considered}} in the article is a <b>donor</b> <b>center</b> embedded in a thin heterostructural barrier separating a semiconductor medium into two halves. As {{a result of the}} small thickness of this barrier, the wave function of an electron bound by the <b>donor</b> <b>center</b> shifts almost completely into both halves of the surrounding semiconductor medium. The ground and first excited electron states of such a <b>donor</b> <b>center</b> are separated from each other by a narrow energy gap determined by the symmetric-antisymmetric tunnel splitting. Such structures can be implemented in both GaAs/AlXGa 1 −XAsGaAs∕AlXGa 1 −XAs and Si/GeXSi 1 −XSi∕GeXSi 1 −X material systems. The second considered subject is an exciton formed in analogous heterostructures when the staggered band alignment takes place between the heterobarrier and semiconductor medium. As a result of such band alignment, the hole participating in the exciton creation is located in the formed quantum well and the electron, which is the hole’s opponent, is separated into halves (on different sides of the quantum well) as before. Unlike the <b>donor</b> <b>center,</b> the exciton can be shifted and localized in arbitrary positions along the staggered “barrier-well” boundary by inhomogeneous electric fields of external controlling gates...|$|E
