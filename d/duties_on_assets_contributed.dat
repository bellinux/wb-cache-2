40|$|In a two-country {{portfolio}} {{model with}} leverage constraints, I focus <b>on</b> private <b>assets</b> {{in order to}} understand how their behaviour can justify an expected excess return as well as the flight-to-safety observed in the data. The specific goal is to study how much these phenomena are {{explained by the fact that}} investors cannot always borrow the same amount of resources pledging domestic assets as pledging foreign collateral. Modeling the leverage constraints accordingly, I propose a methodology to deal with this heterogeneous pledgeability and solve for country portfolios. The central feature of this approach is that any idiosyncratic shocks generate an expected excess returns which compensate the current effects of the shock on the relative riskiness of local versus foreign collateral. The resulting portfolio solution shows that, in equilibrium, investors care for this risk and renounce to a part of the expected excess return - favouring current borrowing. The main consequences are: the home equity bias is smaller than in a model where assets are homogeneously pledgeable; the ex post dynamics of the relative premium paid <b>on</b> collateralized <b>assets</b> <b>contribute</b> to the cross-border transmission of shocks. Given these dynamics, idiosyncratic shocks to the pledgeability of local assets affect the value of external claims and liabilities of the country hit by the shock in such a way that its net foreign assets match those observed in the data during times of flight-to-safety. portfolio choice, riskiness of pledged collateral, return di¤erentials, macroeconomic interdependence...|$|R

Transformation {{is one of the most}} critical aspects of effective strategic management and the South African government, through the (NDPW), is committed to facilitating delivery by other departments by providing accommodation and property management services and meeting the objectives of poverty alleviation and transformation. In 2003 the Department formulated a new vision, mission and value statements to demonstrate the Department’s and its employees’ serious commitment to Government’s vision of a better life for all the country’s citizens. The (NDPW) aims to promote the government’s objectives of economic development, good governance and rising living standards and prosperity by providing and managing the accommodation, housing, land and infrastructure needs of national departments, by promoting the national Expanded Public Works Programme and by encouraging the transformation of the construction and property industries. In pursuance of this objective the Department will endeavour to efficiently manage the asset life cycle of immovable assets under the Department’s custodianship, provide expert advice to all three spheres of Government and parastatals <b>on</b> immovable <b>assets,</b> <b>contribute</b> to the national goals of job creation and poverty alleviation through the coordination of public works programmes nationally, of which the Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) and National Youth Service (NYS) forms an integral part; and provides strategic leadership to the Construction and Property Industries...|$|R

This paper presents a sustainability footprint framework and model that may be used in analyzing the impacts of transportation and other infrastructure systems on regional sustainable development. A specific application of the framework is in the quality of life contributions that transportation systems may make to communities as a function of their impacts <b>on</b> natural <b>assets</b> that <b>contribute</b> inputs and absorb the byproducts of development. The application is illustrated in a case study that uses data from the Atlanta and Chicago Metropolitan Areas to demonstrate how this model may be applied in real life situations. The implications of this model for transport systems research, policy and practice are discussed. The value of this framework and model lie in introducing both spatial and temporal flexibility that may enable stakeholders with widely different priorities to reach consensus on interim goals for sustainable development to ultimately attain sustainability.
