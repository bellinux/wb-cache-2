5|$|Though {{it might}} seem as if the Bible {{translation}} set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent during {{the remainder of the}} century. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> the 17th century that spelling began to be discussed, around the time when the first grammars were written.

5|$|Although {{europium}} {{is present}} {{in most of the}} minerals containing the other rare elements, due to the difficulties in separating the elements <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>until</b> the late 1800s that the element was isolated.
