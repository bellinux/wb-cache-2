40|$|The {{influence}} of the surface roughness of pearlitic grey cast <b>iron</b> <b>discs</b> on the formation of tribofilms {{and the evolution of}} the friction coefficient during a ring on disc tribotest with the addition of magnetite and magnetite–graphite nanopowders as interfacial media was investigated. The roughness parameters of the cast <b>iron</b> <b>discs</b> were varied by electro discharge machining (EDM) and grinding processes, producing four distinct surface roughness conditions.

Focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy on the cast <b>iron</b> <b>discs</b> was carried out to investigate the microstructure of the discs near the tribosurface. These results showed that the EDM process not only varied the surface roughness, but also changed the microstructure of the cast <b>iron</b> <b>discs,</b> promoting the incipient fusion of the cast iron surface, with the formation of ridges and casting defects (pores). As a result, a layer of rapidly solidified metal with a dendritic microstructure was formed near to the surface of the EDMed discs. CAPE...|$|R

50|$|The {{braking system}} was also typical; the front brakes were disc brakes, using a solid <b>iron</b> <b>disc</b> and a single-piston sliding caliper. The rears were drum brakes (a {{technological}} backwards step from the 124, which used discs all round), utilising leading and trailing shoe design {{operated by a}} dual piston fixed slave cylinder. They were operated hydraulically, with a tandem master cylinder assisted by a vacuum servo using two separate circuits. A rear-mounted load sensing valve varied the bias of effort applied to the rear brakes, dependent on the load being carried (and also the pitch dynamics caused by braking effort and road levels). A centrally located floor mounted handbrake operated on the rear axle using bowden cables.|$|E

However, in contrast to Fig 3, the protrusion on the base of the shell in Fig 4 is not part of the shell, but is instead a wrought <b>iron</b> <b>disc</b> attached to the shell by the screw plug. Initially, all studless shells 9 - 17.72 inches, including Palliser shells, were made in one piece as in Fig 3. These shells were identified as Mark I. However, it was found that casting Palliser shells in brittle metal in one piece was extremely difficult, especially for smaller calibres, and that the protusions were liable to chipping during handling. As a result, later Palliser shells 9 - 12.5 inches were made in two pieces as in Fig 4, and identified as Mark II. The separate protrusions were made from wrought iron, cast steel or malleable cast iron.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} {{of what is}} known as the imperfect junction coherer. The principle of operation (microwelding) suggested above for the filings coherer may be less likely to apply to this type because there is no need for decohering. An iron and mercury variation on this device was used by Marconi for the first transatlantic radio message. An earlier form was invented by Jagdish Chandra Bose in 1899. The device consisted of a small metallic cup containing a pool of mercury covered by a very thin insulating film of oil; above the surface of the oil, a small <b>iron</b> <b>disc</b> is suspended. By means of an adjusting screw the lower edge of the disc is made to touch the oil-covered mercury with a pressure small enough not to puncture the film of oil. Its principle of operation is not well understood. The action of detection occurs when the radio frequency signal somehow breaks down the insulating film of oil, allowing the device to conduct, operating the receiving sounder wired in series. This form of coherer is self-restoring and needs no decohering.|$|E

The force exerted on the disc increased continuously, as long as the heave of the surroundings progressed, while it decreased when the heave stopped. The force changed almost parallel to the heaving rate, and it was shown that the decrease was due to the stress relaxation in the frozen soil beneath the fixed disc. In the cold room two types of soil cylinders were set in a test box for frost heaving. One soil sample was set for free heaving, while the other was fixed to a rigid frame and restrained from heaving. The maximum heaving pressure developed at the ice-water interface in the freezing soil was computed from these two experiments. I...|$|E
