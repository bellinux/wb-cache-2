5|$|However, {{vegetables}} often {{also contain}} toxins and antinutrients which {{interfere with the}} absorption of nutrients. These include α-solanine, α-chaconine, enzyme inhibitors (of cholinesterase, protease, amylase, etc.), cyanide and cyanide precursors, oxalic acid, and others. These toxins are natural defenses, used {{to ward off the}} insects, predators and fungi that might attack the plant. Some beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, and cassava roots contain cyanogenic glycoside as do bamboo shoots. These toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking. Green potatoes contain <b>glycoalkaloids</b> and should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Many natural poisons act as {{neurotoxins}} {{that can}} cause paralysis leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey. Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses. An example of a neurotoxin are the <b>glycoalkaloids,</b> from the plant species in the Solanaceae family (includes potato, tomato and eggplant), that are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, muscular paralysis and then death. Neurotoxicity can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, atropine from deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) that functions as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to light, {{physical}} damage, and age increase glycoalkaloid content {{within the}} tuber. Cooking at high temperatures—over —partly destroys these compounds. The concentration of glycoalkaloid in wild potatoes suffices to produce toxic effects in humans. <b>Glycoalkaloids</b> may cause headaches, diarrhea, cramps, and in severe cases coma and death; however, poisoning from potatoes occurs very rarely. Light exposure causes greening from chlorophyll synthesis, thus giving a visual {{clue as to}} areas of the tuber that may have become more toxic; however, this {{does not provide a}} definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other. Varieties contain different levels of <b>glycoalkaloids.</b> The Lenape variety was released in 1967 but was withdrawn in 1970 as it contained high levels of <b>glycoalkaloids.</b> Since then breeders developing new varieties test for this, and sometimes have to discard an otherwise promising cultivar.|$|E

25|$|Potatoes contain toxic {{compounds}} {{known as}} <b>glycoalkaloids,</b> {{of which the}} most prevalent are solanine and chaconine. Solanine {{is also found in}} other plants in the family Solanaceae, which includes such plants as the deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna), henbane (Hyoscyamus niger) and tobacco (Nicotiana), as well as eggplant and tomato. These compounds, which protect the plant from its predators, are, in general, concentrated in its leaves, stems, sprouts, and fruits (in contrast to the roots). In a summary of several studies, the glycoalkaloid content was highest in flowers and sprouts and lowest in the tuber flesh (in order from highest to lowest content, generally: flowers, sprouts, leaves, skin, roots, berries, peel , stems, and tuber flesh).|$|E

The International Potato Center (CIP), has developed new heat tolerant clones which are heat tolerant and also resistant to late blight. These clones offer an opportunity to evaluate yield and <b>glycoalkaloid</b> levels after growth under high temperature environments. We evaluated four sets of 16 full-sib families and 20 clones for tuber yield and <b>glycoalkaloid</b> content in order to estimate narrow-sense and broad-sense heritability respectively. We used a randomized complete block design replicated in three locations in Peru; San Ramon, La Molina and Majes At harvest, the number and weight of marketable and nonmarketable tubers were recorded. We analyzed samples of tubers from each clone for <b>glycoalkaloid</b> content using spectrophotometry. Narrow-sense heritability for tuber yield, tuber number and average tuber weight were 0. 41, 0. 50 and 0. 83, respectively, indicating that further gains in breeding for heat tolerance will be possible. Broadsense heritability for <b>glycoalkaloid</b> content was 0. 63 and correlation with tuber yield was weak, r= 0. 33 and R²= 0. 11 (P< 0. 01). High heritability and weak correlation will allow us to select clones with high tuber yield and low <b>glycoalkaloid</b> content, to serve as candidate varieties and parents in breeding programs...|$|R
