40|$|The {{aims of the}} {{research}} were to study 1) Potency of beef cattle farming development in Kaliori District Rembang Regency and 2) Factors affecting potency of beef cattle farming development. Research has been conducted from February to March 2007. Six villages were chosen using Stratified Random Sampling, i. e. those with high, medium and low popula-tion of livestock. Livestock farmer samples were chosen by Random Sampling. Every village was representated by 15 farmers, so there were 90 samples of farmers. Data was collected based on the primary and second-ary data. Primary {{data were collected from}} result of interview with livestock farmer using of questionaire that has been prepared. Secondary data were collected from institution that related to {{the research}} matter. Data were analyzed descriptively and statistically. L/Q (Location Quotient) was used to know expansion potency. Statistic analysis was done by using multiple regression model, in which to know factors affecting t he development pot ency of public livest ock, using t he equat ion of regression are : Y = a +b 1 x 1 +b 2 x 2 +b 3 x 3 +b 4 x 4 +b 5 x 5 +b 6 x 6 +b 7 x 7 +e, where Y = population of livestock, x 1 : land space, x 2 : the avail-ability of forage, x 3 :labour effusing, x 4 : capital, x 5 : behavior of zootechnic business, x 6 : level of education and x 7 : farming experience. The result showed that potency of livestock development for level of district pertained potential (LQ = 1, 12), while 6 location of village yields potential storey of : Maguan (1, 23; potential), <b>Dresi</b> Wetan (1, 22; potential), Meteseh (1, 20; potential) Sendang Agung (1, 20; potential), Banyudono (1, 00; balance) and Tasikharjo (0, 87; less potential). Factors of x 1 (farm wide), x 2 (the availability of forage), x 3 (labour effusing), x 4 (capital), x 5 (behavior of zooteknik business), x 6 (level of education) and x 7 (farming experience) were highly significantly different (P< 0, 01) on development of public livestock, with regression equation : Y = - 1, 746 + 0, 008 x 1 + 0, 139 x 2 + 0, 023 x 3 + 0, 011 X 4 + 0, 018 x 5 + 0, 025 x 6 + 0, 022 x 7 + e and R 2 value = 0. 923. Parsially, factor having effect was farm wide, feed availability of forage, labour and capital, while behavior of zootechnic, level of education and farming stripper, factors were not significant.
