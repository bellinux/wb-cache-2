5|$|In the Metamorphoses by Antoninus Liberalis, written {{somewhere in}} the 2nd or 3rd century A.D., the myth is set in Phoenicia, near Mount Lebanon. Here King Thias, son of Belus and Orithyia, had a {{daughter}} named Smyrna. Being of great beauty, she was sought by men from far and wide. She had devised many tricks in order to delay her parents and defer the day they would choose a husband for her. Smyrna had been driven mad by desire for her father {{and did not want}} anybody else. At first she hid her desires, eventually telling her nurse, Hippolyte, the secret of her true feelings. Hippolyte told the king that a girl of exalted parentage wanted to lie with him, but in secret. The affair lasted {{for an extended period of}} time, and Smyrna became pregnant. At this point, Thias desired to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> so he hid a light, illuminating the room and discovering Smyrna's identity when she entered. In shock, Smyrna gave birth prematurely to her child. She then raised her hands and said a prayer, which was heard by Zeus who took pity on her and turned her into a tree. Thias killed himself, and it was on the wish of Zeus that the child was brought up and named Adonis.|$|E

The eldest Pandava Yudhishthira requests Krishna to stay with them for a couple of days. One day, Krishna and the middle Pandava Arjuna go for hunting in the forest.

Krishna who saw her and asked Arjuna to meet her to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> When Arjuna inquired, the girl told him that she was Kalindi, the daughter of Surya, and that she was living in a house constructed by her father in the river where she has been was performing austerities with intent to have Vishnu as her husband and would remain there, until she finds him. Arjuna conveys Kalindi's message to Krishna, the avatar of Vishnu, who readily agreed to marry the beautiful damsel. Then they traveled to Indraprastha with Kalindi in the chariot and met Yudhishthira. After a stay of few days there, Krishna and Kalindi returned to his capital Dwarka with their entourage and duly married each other. According to Bhagavata Purana she had ten sons: Shruta, Kavi, Vrsa, Vira, Subahu, Bhadra, Santi, Darsa, Purnamasa and the youngest, Somaka. The Vishnu Purana mentions that she had many sons headed by Shruta.|$|E

500|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asia and challenge Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States, saying: [...] "When I was in school , you never saw anyone who looked like us that was on TV. And that was really weird for me because there's so many people of South Asian descent in America – in the world. I didn't want to be this stereotype of what Indian people are usually seen as in global pop culture. We don't just have to be Apu from The Simpsons." [...] After being given all 26 pilot scripts which ABC was filming for the 2015–2016 television season, she chose Quantico. The actress, who had appeared in over fifty films at that time, was required to audition for the first time, which she found nerve-wracking. Safran was impressed by Chopra's audition, which helped him re-envision the character, adding [...] "She walked into the room, and it was like the molecules shifted in that way that superstars have. I was very confused because I didn't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> but we all sat up straighter. We're like this is clearly a movie star; it's like every {{hair on the back of}} your neck stands up watching her act. When I went back home I couldn't think about anyone else." [...] Chopra became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series.|$|E
