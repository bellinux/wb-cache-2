5|$|Many long-time {{employees}} of Olympus Corp were shocked and angry, and felt {{betrayed by the}} executives who were responsible for bringing public humiliation onto the company. Former director Koji Miyata started a web site, called Olympus Grassroots, demanding clean-up at the company they say they love. Miyata also circulated a petition targeted at employees calling on the reinstatement of Woodford. As Olympus has a 70-percent market share in endoscopy, the scandal caused anxiety and concern among the medical profession, which sees Olympus <b>endoscopes</b> as irreplaceable.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{still early}} in his {{surgical}} career, Negus took {{a different approach to}} that which was common at the time. Rather than be apprenticed to a leading surgeon in his ENT (ear, nose and throat) speciality, he undertook basic research on the structure of the larynx that would lead to a higher degree in 1924 and the publication of books and papers on the topic in later years. While engaged in this research, Negus continued his work at King's College Hospital, being appointed junior surgeon in 1924. It was during this period, following his return from the USA, that Negus both promoted the methods and tools he had seen used in Philadelphia by Jackson, and worked to improve the designs of the <b>endoscopes</b> and other equipment used in ENT surgery. These instruments, developed in collaboration with the Genito-Urinary Company of London, included laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes (such as the Negus bronchoscope) and oesophagoscopes. Other surgical innovations developed by Negus included an operating table (known as the King's College table), and a speaking valve for use in tracheotomy tubes. He also helped develop strategies for treatments of throat cancer to aid the choice between surgery and radiotherapy.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen peroxide, in both {{liquid and}} as vaporized {{hydrogen}} peroxide (VHP), is another chemical sterilizing agent.

The biggest advantage of hydrogen peroxide as a sterilant is the short cycle time.

To evaluate its safety and feasibility, we performed preliminary cadaveric study prior to clinical endoscopic intervention in the thoracic and lumbar spinal canal. METHODS The <b>endoscope</b> that had a directable tip with external diameters of 2. 2 mm was used in this study. The <b>endoscope</b> was inserted percutaneously in the lumbar region (lumbar puncture method) in nine cadavers and was advanced rostrally under endoscopic monitoring. In advancing the <b>endoscope</b> to the upper thoracic region, dorsal, lateral and ventral route was applied. When the <b>endoscope</b> was advanced to the upper thoracic region, vertebral canal from Th 1 to L 4 was opened to examine whether there were any injuries to spinal cord and nerves.

40|$|Colonoscopy {{is one of}} {{most widely}} used {{screening}} procedures conducted for detection colon cancers. Nevertheless, since the procedure is extremely uncomfortable, willingness to have a colonoscopy is very low. The <b>endoscope</b> looping, which is a common occurrence during colonoscopy procedures can cause severe pain to the patients. The detection of <b>endoscope</b> looping is difficult just from {{the feel of the}} <b>endoscope,</b> because of the <b>endoscope</b> stiffness and the high tension developed in the twisted <b>endoscope</b> inside the colon. The occurrence of <b>Endoscope</b> looping can be detected or prevented if the surgeon has sufficient spatial and orientation information of the <b>endoscope.</b> Hence, our goal is to develop a technique to track the three dimensional representation of the <b>endoscope</b> and develop a navigational aid for the surgeon to guide the colonoscopy.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: This report {{describes}} the design, development, {{and testing of}} a novel compact surgical assistant robot to control the orientation and insertion depth of a laparoscopic <b>endoscope</b> during minimally invasive abdominal surgery. In contrast to typical <b>endoscope</b> manipulators, the described robot is particularly compact and lightweight, is simple {{to set up and}} use, occupies no floor or operating table space, and does not limit access to the patient in any way. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sterilizable <b>endoscope</b> manipulator is sufficiently small and lightweight at 625 g and 110 mm in diameter that it can be placed directly on the abdomen of the patient without interfering with other handheld instruments during minimally invasive surgery. It consists of an annular base, a clamp to hold an <b>endoscope</b> trocar, and two joints which enable azimuth rotation and inclination of the <b>endoscope</b> about a pivot point at the incision. The <b>endoscope</b> insertion depth is controlled by a cable winding acting against a compression spring on the <b>endoscope</b> shaft. Voice recognition and miniature keypad user command interfaces are provided, and the manipulator motors are backdriveable for manual repositioning. RESULTS: <b>Endoscope</b> camera trajectory-following accuracy and response-time results were measured using an optical localizer. Experimental results are given comparing the current prototype with the previous cable-driven prototype. The <b>endoscope</b> manipulator and its user interface were tested and evaluated by several surgeons during a series of minimally invasive surgical training procedures on cadavers and animals.

25|$|The patient lies on his/her {{left side}} with the head resting comfortably on a pillow. A mouth-guard is placed between the teeth to prevent the patient from biting on the <b>endoscope.</b> The <b>endoscope</b> is then passed over the tongue and into the oropharynx.

The <b>endoscope</b> is gradually advanced down the esophagus making note of any pathology. Excessive insufflation of the stomach is avoided at this stage. The <b>endoscope</b> is quickly passed through the stomach and through the pylorus to examine {{the first and second}} parts of the duodenum. Once this has been completed, the <b>endoscope</b> is withdrawn into the stomach and a more thorough examination is performed including a J-maneuver. This involves retroflexing the tip of the scope so it resembles a 'J' shape in order to examine the fundus and gastroesophageal junction. Any additional procedures are performed at this stage. The air in the stomach is aspirated before removing the <b>endoscope.</b> Still photographs can be made during the procedure and later shown to the patient to help explain any findings.|$|R
