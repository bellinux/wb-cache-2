40|$|This paper {{proposes that}} the maximum entropy {{principle}} {{can be used for}} determining the drop size distribution of hydrometeors. The {{maximum entropy principle}} can be applied to any physical systems with many degrees of freedom in order to determine a distribution of a variable when the following are known: 1) the restriction variable that leads to a homogeneous distribution without constraint and 2) a set of integrals weighted by the distribution, such as mean and variance, that constrain the system. The principle simply seeks a distribution that gives the maximum possible number of partitions among all the possible states. A continuous limit can be taken by assuming a constant bin size for the restriction variable. This paper suggests that the <b>drop</b> <b>mass</b> is the most likely restriction variable, and the laws of conservation of total bulk mass and of total vertical <b>drop</b> <b>mass</b> flux are two of the most likely physical constraints to a hydrometeor drop size distribution. Under this consideration, the distribution is most likely constrained by the total bulk mass when an ensemble of drops under the coalescence-breakup process is confined inside a closed box. Alternatively, for an artificial rain produced from the top of a high ceiling under a constant mass flux of water fall, the total <b>drop</b> <b>mass</b> flux is the most likely constraint to the drop size distribution. Preliminary analysis of already-published data is not inconsistent with the above hypotheses, although the results are rather inconclusive. Data in the large drop size limit are required in order to reach a more definite conclusion...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the evaporation dynamics of water microdrops deposited on atomic force microscope cantilevers, which were employed as sensitive stress, mass and temperature sensors with high time resolution. The technique has some advantages with respect to video-microscope imaging and ultra-precision weighting with electronic microbalances or quartz crystal microbalances, since it allows to measure more drop parameters simultaneously for smaller drop sizes. On hydrophobic surfaces a single measurement with a silicon cantilever provides data for the <b>drop</b> <b>mass,</b> contact angle and radius until very close to complete evaporation. On hydrophilic surfaces, it is as well possible to measure <b>drop</b> <b>mass</b> and inclination of the cantilever. The technique further allows to detect differences between water microdrops evaporating from clean hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. On hydrophilic surfaces the cantilever inclination is negative {{at the end of}} the evaporation process. Negative inclination mostly occurs when drops are pinned. This effect can not be detected with any of the other well-established methods. The evidence arises that on the hydrophilic surface a thin water film forms, while this is not the case for the hydrophobic surface. Metal coated cantilevers can be used as thermometers, and allow to precisely measure the temperature of an evaporating microdrop. This can be relevant for further applications of cantilevers as calorimetric sensors for chemical reactions taking place in drops on their surface. The applicability of Young’s equation was verified for microdrops. It was shown that Young’s equation can not be applied to microscopic drops due to their fast evaporation. A study on evaporation of microdrops in saturated vapor atmosphere was performed to estimate evaporation times and compare them with a theory developed, which relates the initial drop volume with the overall evaporation time...|$|R
