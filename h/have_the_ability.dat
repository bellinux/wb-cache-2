5|$|A hazard {{of flight}} for very small insects such as thrips is the {{possibility}} of being trapped by water. Thrips have non-wetting bodies and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to ascend a meniscus by arching their bodies and working their way head-first and upwards along the water surface in order to escape.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{such as the}} {{flounder}} <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> {{to adapt}} their camouflage patterns to suit the background, and they do so extremely effectively, selecting patterns that match the spatial scales of the current background.|$|E
5|$|Sharks <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to {{determine}} {{the direction of a}} given scent based on the timing of scent detection in each nostril. This is similar to the method mammals use {{to determine}} direction of sound.|$|E
50|$|Deathwatch is {{a native}} of an alien demonic {{dimension}} and so derived at least some of his superhuman powers from his non-human heritage. Deathwatch <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to absorb life from another creature that is experiencing pain or death and enhance his own health, strength, stamina, agility, and reflexes. He <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to physically penetrate a victim's body and disrupt internal organs without creating a surface wound. He also <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to absorb and access a victim's short-term memories by penetrating the victim's brain physically with his fingers, and <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to derive surges of physical and emotional pleasure from the proximity of death.|$|R

5|$|Some snakes <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> {{to change}} the hue of their scales slowly. This is {{typically}} seen {{in cases where the}} snake becomes lighter or darker with change in season. In some cases, this change may take place between day and night.|$|E
5|$|Spiral arms also <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> {{to cause}} climatic changes on a planet. Passing through the dense {{molecular}} clouds of galactic spiral arms, stellar winds may be pushed {{back to the}} point that a reflective hydrogen layer accumulates in an orbiting planet's atmosphere, perhaps leading to a snowball Earth scenario.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{propagating}} TSE infectivity in cell-free {{reactions and}} in purified component chemical reactions {{is thought to}} strongly suggest against TSE viral nature. However, some viruses, such as Poliovirus, <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to replicate in cell-free reactions.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>abilities</b> {{associated}} with each character vary and include defensive, offensive, and bonus earning powers. For example, <b>the</b> Assassin <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to kill another character, preventing him or her from taking a turn; <b>the</b> King <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to move <b>the</b> crown counter, and the Warlord is able to destroy districts.|$|R

5|$|Termites {{going through}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis {{on the path}} to becoming alates form a subcaste in certain species of termite, functioning as potential supplementary reproductives. These supplementary reproductives only mature into primary reproductives upon the death of a king or queen, or when the primary reproductives are separated from the colony. Supplementaries <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to replace a dead primary reproductive, and there may also be more than a single supplementary within a colony. Some queens <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction. Studies show that while termite queens mate with the king to produce colony workers, the queens reproduce their replacements (neotenic queens) parthenogenetically.|$|E
5|$|The Long Valley to Mono Lake {{region is}} one of three areas in California that are in the United States Geological Survey's {{volcanic}} hazards program. These areas are in the program because they have been active in the last 2,000 years and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to produce explosive eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Three new civilizations {{are added}} in Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties. Each Asian civilization has monks, instead of explorers as in {{previous}} games.

5|$|Web-spinning {{also caused}} the {{association}} of the spider with creation myths, as they seem to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to produce their own worlds. Dreamcatchers are depictions of spiderwebs. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature. They placed emphasis on animals and often depicted spiders in their art.|$|E
5|$|A {{cover system}} {{can be used in}} combat as {{assistance}} against enemies. Players <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to lean around, over, and under cover, which {{can be used as a}} tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options; they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around. Weapon ammunition must be manually retrieved from the ground or from dead enemies. Players have access to a weapon inventory, which allows them to carry as many weapons as they find. With some of these weapons, players <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to dual wield, giving them an advantage over enemies by dealing twice as much damage. Players can also customize weapons through the use of upgrades; for example, a rocket launcher can be attached to the side of an assault rifle, and a laser cannon can be transformed into a wire cutting tool.|$|E
5|$|Avoidance therapy {{consists}} of minimizing or eliminating triggers. For example, {{in those who}} are sensitive to light, using a small television, avoiding video games, or wearing dark glasses may be useful. Operant-based biofeedback based on the EEG waves has some support in {{those who do not}} respond to medications. Psychological methods should not, however, be used to replace medications. Some dogs, commonly referred to as seizure dogs, may help during or after a seizure. It is not clear if dogs <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to predict seizures before they occur.|$|E

5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (the lining of the uterus or womb). It {{is the result of}} the abnormal growth of cells that <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause.|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto III is an action-adventure {{game played}} from a third-person view. Players {{complete}} missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to {{progress through the}} story. It is possible to have several active missions running at one time, as some missions require players to wait for further instructions or events. Outside of missions, players can freely roam the game's open world, and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to complete optional side missions. Liberty City is composed of three boroughs: Portland, Staunton Island, and Shoreside Vale; the islands are unlocked to players as the story progresses.|$|E
5|$|ICS {{compatible}} interfaces particularly {{suitable for}} bughouse include Thief and BabasChess. They <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to display both boards {{at the same}} time and store played or observed games, they also have partner communication buttons and a lag indicator. Special Chess Engine Communication Protocol compatible engines have been written that support bughouse, examples are Sunsetter, Sjeng and TJchess. Although much faster than humans, they lack in positional understanding and especially in coordination and communication, an essential skill in this team game.|$|E
40|$|We {{argue for}} argue for {{extending}} the conventional distributed objects model in two important ways: (1) <b>Having</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to insert injectors (filters, wrappers) into the communication path between components, and (2) <b>Having</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to annotate communications with additional information, and to propagate these annotations through an application...|$|R
50|$|Locus <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to {{teleport}} herself, other people, {{or other}} objects {{she is in}} physical contact with, to anywhere that she, or they, have been before. This makes her different from other teleporters like Nightcrawler who can teleport himself to anywhere in his range he can visualize. She also <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to levitate. She <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to select parts of people or objects (say a hand or head), and teleport them away, leaving the rest behind, often with deadly results. She also displayed the power to fire energy blasts.|$|R

5|$|On June 1, 2011, Twitter {{announced}} its own integrated photo-sharing service that enables users to upload a photo and attach it to a Tweet right from Twitter.com. Users now also <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to add pictures to Twitter's search by adding hashtags to the tweet. Twitter {{also plans to}} provide photo galleries designed to gather and syndicate all photos that a user has uploaded on Twitter and third-party services such as TwitPic.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the design}} intents of the SS190 variety of this {{cartridge}} was that it <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to penetrate Kevlar protective vests—such as the NATO CRISAT vest—that will stop conventional pistol bullets. Fired from the P90, the SS190 is capable of penetrating the CRISAT vest at a range of 200m (219yd), or a Level IIIA Kevlar vest at the same range. However, sporting variants of the 5.7×28mm are classified by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) as not armor-piercing.|$|E
5|$|Pupae <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> {{to enter}} facultative diapause, {{the state of}} arrested {{development}} and growth {{in response to a}} change in the environment. By preparing themselves for a major change in environmental conditions, they can increase reproductive success. Diapause increases with increasing latitude. In tropical conditions, populations breed continuously, and only 2-4% of pupae diapause. In subtropical and temperate regions, most individuals diapause. Individuals who don't enter diapause in these areas emerge in late fall and die without reproducing. Drought-responsive diapause has also been observed in the summer.|$|E
