5|$|The most {{successful}} reagents employed in a stoichiometric fashion are shown below. The {{first is a}} bicyclic oxathiane that has been employed in the synthesis of the β-adrenergic compound dichloroisoproterenol (DCI) but <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> by the availability of only one enantiomer of the reagent. The synthesis of the axial diastereomer is rationalized via the 1,3-anomeric effect which reduces the nucleophilicity of the equatorial lone pair. The conformation of the ylide <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> by transannular strain and approach of the aldehyde <b>is</b> <b>limited</b> to one face of the ylide by steric interactions with the methyl substituents.|$|E
