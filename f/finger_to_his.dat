5|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, Berg {{had no real}} job, living off friends and {{relatives}} who put up with {{him because of his}} charisma. When they would ask what he did for a living, he would reply by putting his <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> lips, giving them the impression that he was still a spy. A lifelong bachelor, he lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, he became moody and snappish after the war and did not seem to care for much in life besides his books. His brother finally grew fed up with the arrangement and asked Moe to leave and even had eviction papers drawn up. After being evicted from his brother's home, Berg moved in with his sister Ethel in Belleville, New Jersey, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
25|$|He secured {{his first}} trophy {{by winning the}} League Cup against Liverpool 3–2 (AET) in Cardiff. Towards {{the end of the}} match, Mourinho was escorted from the touchline after putting his <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mouth in the {{direction}} of Liverpool fans, as a response to taunts directed towards him whilst Liverpool were leading, before the equalising goal.|$|E
500|$|The use of {{the middle}} finger has become {{pervasive}} in popular culture. The band Cobra Starship released a song called [...] "Middle Finger", and released a music video that showed people giving the finger. Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan installed a marble statue of a middle finger measuring , located {{directly in front of}} the Milan Stock Exchange. A now-famous photograph of Johnny Cash shows him giving the middle finger to a photographer during a 1969 concert at San Quentin State Prison, released as At San Quentin. However, the photo remained fairly obscure until 1998, when producer Rick Rubin made it the centerpiece of an ad in Billboard criticizing country radio for not giving airplay to Cash's Grammy-winning album Unchained. Cameron Diaz made the gesture during a photo shoot for Esquire. Harold Lloyd shot the <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own reflection in a Coney Island funhouse after getting paint on his suit in Speedy, his final silent feature, from 1928.|$|E

2500|$|This is {{generally}} done {{by using a}} physical representation of a trader's intentions with his hands. [...] If a trader wants to buy ten contracts at a price of eight, for example, in the pit he would yell [...] "8 for 10", stating price before quantity, and turn his palm inward toward his face, putting his index <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> forehead denoting ten; {{if he were to}} be buying one, he would place his index finger on his chin. [...] If the trader wants to sell five contracts at a price of eight, they would yell [...] "5 at 8", stating quantity before price, and show one hand with palm facing outward, showing 5 fingers. [...] The combination of hand-signals and vocal representation between the way a trader expresses bids and offers is a protection against misinterpretation by other market participants. For historical purposes, an illustrated project to record the hand signal language used in CBOT's trading pits has been compiled and published.|$|E
2500|$|When {{photographic}} curator Maya Benton {{began to}} catalog Vishniac's negatives for the archive of the International Center of Photography, she noticed that, {{in his book}} A Vanished World, Vishniac juxtaposed photos to tell stories, and wrote captions that were {{not supported by the}} material. In the final spread of the book, for example, there is a photo of a man peering through a metal door; on the opposite page a small boy points with his <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> eye. Vishiniac's caption reads: [...] "The father is hiding from the Endecy (members of the National Democratic Party). His son signals him that they are approaching. Warsaw, 1935-1938." [...] At the front of the book, additional commentary reads: [...] "The pogromshchiki" [...] (pogrom lynch mob) [...] "are coming. But the iron door was no protection." [...] Benton's research found that the photos were from different rolls of film, taken in different towns, so the scene described in the book [...] "almost certainly did not happen".|$|E
2500|$|Mr. America's last WWE {{appearance}} {{was on the}} June 26 episode of SmackDown! when Big Show and The World's Greatest Tag Team (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) defeated Brock Lesnar, Kurt Angle, and Mr. America in a six-man tag team match. After the show went off the air, Mr. America unmasked to show the fans that he was indeed Hogan, putting his <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> lips telling the fans to keep quiet about his secret. The next week, Hogan quit WWE due to frustration with the creative team. On the July 3 episode of SmackDown!, McMahon showed the footage of Mr. America unmasking as Hogan and [...] "fired" [...] him, although Hogan had already quit in real life. The Mr. America charactercame under fire briefly from Marvel Comics, who anointed it a rip-off of Captain America, citing costume similarity. It was later revealed that Hogan was unhappy with the payoffs for his matches after his comeback under the Mr. America gimmick. McMahon decided to terminate Hogan's contract and Hogan left WWE in 2003.|$|E

2500|$|The {{work had}} its genesis in a {{commission}} from the dancer Ida Rubinstein, who asked Ravel {{to make an}} orchestral transcription of six pieces from Isaac Albéniz's set of piano pieces, Iberia. While working on the transcription, Ravel was informed that the movements had already been orchestrated by Spanish conductor Enrique Fernández Arbós, and that copyright law prevented any other arrangement from being made. When Arbós heard of this, {{he said he would}} happily waive his rights and allow Ravel to orchestrate the pieces. However, Ravel changed his mind and decided initially to orchestrate one of his own works. He then changed his mind again and decided to write a completely new piece based on the musical form and Spanish dance called bolero. While on vacation at St Jean-de-Luz, Ravel went to the piano and played a melody with one <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> friend Gustave Samazeuilh, saying [...] "Don't you think this theme has an insistent quality? I'm going to try and repeat it a number of times without any development, gradually increasing the orchestra as best I can." [...] This piece was initially called Fandango, but its title was soon changed to [...] "Boléro". According to Idries Shah the main melody is adapted from a melody composed for and used in Sufi training.|$|E
