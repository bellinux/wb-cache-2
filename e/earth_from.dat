5|$|Jupiter {{has been}} called the Solar System's vacuum cleaner, because of its immense gravity well and {{location}} near the inner Solar System. It receives the most frequent comet impacts of the Solar System's planets. It was thought that the planet served to partially shield the inner system from cometary bombardment. However, recent computer simulations suggest that Jupiter does not cause a net {{decrease in the number of}} comets that pass through the inner Solar System, as its gravity perturbs their orbits inward roughly as often as it accretes or ejects them. This topic remains controversial among scientists, as some think it draws comets towards <b>Earth</b> <b>from</b> the Kuiper belt while others think that Jupiter protects <b>Earth</b> <b>from</b> the alleged Oort cloud. Jupiter experiences about 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than Earth.|$|E

The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes.

40|$|Keynote lectureEnd-of-life neodymium-iron-boron and samarium-cobalt {{permanent}} magnets, {{fluorescent lamps}} and metal hydride batteries are valuable secondary resources of rare earths. These resources are characterised by relatively small volumes, but {{high concentrations of}} rare earths [1]. On the other hand, industrial process residues such as bauxite residue (red mud) and phosphogypsum contain low concentrations of rare earths, but are available in huge volumes [2]. Recovery of rare <b>earths</b> <b>from</b> end-of-life consumer goods by urban mining and from industrial process residues by landfill mining can partly mitigate the supply risk of these critical metals. Efficient recovery of rare <b>earths</b> <b>from</b> these resources is a technological challenge, even though many pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes have been described in the literature. At KU Leuven (Belgium), we are developing new breakthrough technologies for recovery and separation of rare earths based {{on the use of}} ionic liquids. Ionic liquids are solvents that consist entirely of ions [3]. These solvents have properties that are quite different from those of conventional molecular organic solvents. Ionic liquids can find applications as lixiviants for selective leaching of rare <b>earths</b> <b>from</b> solid materials, as organic phase in solvent extraction processes for separation of rare earths, and as electrolytes for the electrodeposition of rare earths and alloys. During this talk, several new ionic liquid processes will be discussed: (1) recovery of yttrium and europium from end-of-life fluorescent lamps [4](2) recovery of rare <b>earths</b> <b>from</b> neodymium-iron-boron magnets [5], (3) separation of rare <b>earths</b> <b>from</b> transition metals by extraction with undiluted ionic liquids [6] (4) separation of rare earths by homogeneous liquid-liquid extraction (HLLE) [7] (5) efficient recovery of scandium from leachates of bauxite residue [8].
