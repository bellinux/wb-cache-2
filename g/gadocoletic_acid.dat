50|$|<b>Gadocoletic</b> <b>acid</b> (Bracco SpA), {{also known}} as B-22956 and B22956/1, is a Gd-DTPA {{derivative}} that is currently in development, but {{has not yet been}} approved for clinical use.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the diagnostic {{value of the}} intravascular contrast agent <b>gadocoletic</b> <b>acid</b> (B- 22956) in three-dimensional, free breathing coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for stenosis detection in patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease. METHODS: Eighteen patients underwent three-dimensional, free breathing coronary MRA of {{the left and right}} coronary system before and after intravenous application of a single dose of <b>gadocoletic</b> <b>acid</b> (B- 22956) using three different dose regimens (group A 0. 050 mmol/kg; group B 0. 075 mmol/kg; group C 0. 100 mmol/kg). Precontrast scanning followed a coronary MRA standard non-contrast T 2 preparation/turbo-gradient echo sequence (T 2 Prep); for postcontrast scanning an inversion-recovery gradient echo sequence was used (real-time navigator correction for both scans). In pre- and postcontrast scans quantitative analysis of coronary MRA data was performed to {{determine the}} number of visible side branches, vessel length and vessel sharpness of each of the three coronary arteries (LAD, LCX, RCA). The number of assessable coronary artery segments was determined to calculate sensitivity and specificity for detection of stenosis > or = 50 % on a segment-to-segment basis (16 -segment-model) in pre- and postcontrast scans with x-ray coronary angiography as the standard of reference. RESULTS: Dose group B (0. 075 mmol/kg) was preferable with regard to improvement of MR angiographic parameters: in postcontrast scans all MR angiographic parameters increased significantly except for the number of visible side branches of the left circumflex artery. In addition, assessability of coronary artery segments significantly improved postcontrast in this dose group (67 versus 88 %, p or = 50 %...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} <b>gadocoletic</b> <b>acid</b> (B- 22956), a gadolinium-based paramagnetic blood pool agent, for contrast-enhanced coronary {{magnetic resonance}} angiography (MRA) in a Phase I clinical trial, and {{to compare the}} findings with those obtained using a standard noncontrast T 2 preparation sequence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The left coronary system was imaged in 12 healthy volunteers before B- 22956 application and 5 (N = 11) and 45 (N = 7) minutes after application of 0. 075 mmol/kg of body weight (BW) of B- 22956. Additionally, imaging of the right coronary system was performed 23 minutes after B- 22956 application (N = 6). A three-dimensional gradient echo sequence with T 2 preparation (precontrast) or inversion recovery (IR) pulse (postcontrast) with real-time navigator correction was used. Assessment of {{the left and right}} coronary systems was performed qualitatively (a 4 -point visual score for image quality) and quantitatively in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), vessel sharpness, visible vessel length, maximal luminal diameter, and the number of visible side branches. RESULTS: Significant (P < 0. 01) increases in SNR (+ 42 %) and CNR (+ 86 %) were noted five minutes after B- 22956 application, compared to precontrast T 2 preparation values. A significant increase in CNR (+ 40 %, P < 0. 05) was also noted 45 minutes postcontrast. Vessels (left anterior descending artery (LAD), left coronary circumflex (LCx), and right coronary artery (RCA)) were also significantly (P < 0. 05) sharper on postcontrast images. Significant increases in vessel length were noted for the LAD (P < 0. 05) and LCx and RCA (both P < 0. 01), while significantly more side branches were noted for the LAD and RCA (both P < 0. 05) when compared to precontrast T 2 preparation values. CONCLUSION: The use of the intravascular contrast agent B- 22956 substantially improves both objective and subjective parameters of image quality on high-resolution three-dimensional coronary MRA. The increase in SNR, CNR, and vessel sharpness minimizes current limitations of coronary artery visualization with high-resolution coronary MRA...|$|E
40|$|Contrast-enhanced {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (CE-MRI) is a valuable technique for the diagnosis of liver diseases. As <b>gadocoletic</b> <b>acid</b> trisodium salt (B 22956 / 1), a new contrast agent showing high biliary excretion, may be potentially advantageous in hepatobiliary imaging, {{the aim of the}} study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of hepatic transport of the B 22956 ion in a cellular model of hepatic tumor. B 22956 ion uptake was measured in tumoral (HepG 2) and nontumoral (Chang liver) hepatic cell lines. Absolute quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase (RT) -polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses, using cloned PCR products as standards, were performed on total RNA of both cell lines and normal liver to evaluate the transcription of 12 transport genes: SLCO 1 A 2, SLCO 2 B 1, SLCO 1 B 1, SLCO 3 A 1, SLCO 4 A 1, SLCO 1 B 3, SLC 22 A 7, SLC 22 A 8, SLC 22 A 1, SLC 10 A 1, SLC 15 A 1, and SLC 15 A 2. B 22956 transport was more efficient in Chang liver than in HepG 2 cells and was inhibited by cholecystokinin- 8, a specific substrate of OATP 1 B 3. Real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed different transcription profiles in the tumoral and nontumoral cell lines. Compared with normal liver, the expression of SLCO 1 B 1, SLCO 3 A 1, and SLCO 1 B 3 was greatly repressed in HepG 2 cells, whereas SLCO 2 B 1, SLC 22 A 7, and SLC 22 A 8 expression was either maintained or increased. On the contrary, in Chang liver cells, SLC 22 A 7 and SLC 22 A 8 genes were undetectable, whereas the expression of SLCO 3 A 1, SLCO 4 A 1, and SLCO 1 B 3 was similar to normal liver. Transport studies and gene expression analyses indicated that B 22956 ion is a good substrate to the liver-specific OATP 1 B 3, reported to be poorly expressed or absent in human liver tumors. Therefore, B 22956 may be helpful in detecting hepatic neoplastic lesions by CE-MRI...|$|E
