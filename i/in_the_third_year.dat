5|$|By early 1896, {{many in the}} Democratic Party were bitterly {{opposed to}} President Cleveland and his policies. The United States was by then <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>year</b> of a deep recession, the Panic of 1893. Cleveland was a firm {{supporter}} of the gold standard, and soon after the recession began forced through repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which he believed had helped cause it. Sherman's act, although not restoring bimetallism, had required the government to purchase and coin large quantities of silver bullion, and its repeal outraged supporters of free silver. Other Cleveland policies, such as his forcible suppression of the Pullman strike, led to the Democrats losing control of both houses of Congress in the 1894 midterm elections, and to a revolt against him by silver supporters within his party.|$|E
5|$|Original {{estimates}} {{predicted a}} daily ridership of 180,000 after launch, growing to 400,000 by 2036. In {{view of a}} 50% drop in airline passengers {{in the wake of}} the 1997 Asian financial crisis, forecasts were revised downwards. The final initial ridership estimate was 140,000 passengers per day. Actual initial ridership did not match these projections. In September 2007, six months after opening, THSRC carried 1.5million passengers monthly, translating to about 50,000 passengers daily. In the second year, passenger numbers almost doubled. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>year,</b> average daily ridership continued to grow to 88,000 passengers per day, jumping to over 120,000 passengers per day in 2012. (updated to September 2012) Seat occupancy was around 45% in the first three years, with a modest improvement achieved in 2009, and reached 53.91% in 2012. (updated to September 2012) Punctuality is stable above 99%.|$|E
5|$|The Chronicles {{version of}} events makes it appear that Baldred was driven out shortly after the battle, but this was {{probably}} not the case. A document from Kent survives which gives the date, March 826, as being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>year</b> {{of the reign of}} Beornwulf. This makes it likely that Beornwulf still had authority in Kent at this date, as Baldred's overlord; hence Baldred was apparently still in power. In Essex, Ecgberht expelled King Sigered, though the date is unknown. It may have been delayed until 829, since a later chronicler associates the expulsion with a campaign of Ecgberht's in that year against the Mercians.|$|E

25|$|Learning {{a foreign}} {{language}} is compulsory throughout Germany in secondary schools and English {{is one of the}} more popular choices. Students at certain Gymnasium are required to learn Latin as their first foreign language and choose a second foreign language. The list of available foreign languages as well as the hours of compulsory foreign language lessons differ from state to state, but the more common choices, besides Latin, are English, French, Spanish, ancient Greek. Many schools also offer voluntary study groups for the purpose of learning other languages. At which stage students begin learning {{a foreign language}} differs from state to state and is tailored according to the cultural and socio-economical dynamics of each state. In some states, foreign language education starts in the Grundschule (primary school). For example, in North Rhine-Westphalia, English starts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>year</b> of elementary school. Baden-Württemberg starts with English or French in the first year. The Saarland, which borders France, begins with French <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>year</b> of primary school and French is taught in high school as the main foreign language.|$|E

The study found motivational peaks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>years</b> of junior high school, secondary school, and university, with motivational ebbs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intervening periods of study. Higher levels of motivation were attributed to entrance examinations, positive features of the learning environment, future career preparation, and credit requirements, while drops in motivation were attributed to insufficient skills (self-evaluated), negative features of the learning environment, and a general dislike for, or lack of interest in, English. 特集 外国語教...|$|R
