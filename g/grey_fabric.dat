500|$|An {{experimental}} station {{was established to}} grow sugar at Mongalla in the 1950s, and there were plans to establish commercial operations. However, after independence in 1956 the Khartoum government shifted the sugar project to the north, where it is grown under much less favorable conditions with heavy irrigation. After the First Sudanese Civil War ended in 1972, there were plans to revive sugar production at Mongalla, and although Mongalla Sugar Processing Factory operated on a low-scale in the 1970s, it ceased production when civil war broke out again in 1983.A clothing mill also operated in the 1970s but was deactivated due to the unrest in the early 1980s. A paper mill was also planned at Mongalla, to be fed by eucalyptus species planted in a 70,000 feddan area.Equipment was supplied from Denmark between 1975 and 1976 for use in an agro-industrial complex at Mongalla. This would include a power station and pump station to support an abbatoir, poultry project, fish-receiving plant [...] and wood-working factory. The equipment arrived but was not installed, and eventually rusted away. A project funded by Khartoum also established six textile-manufacturing units in Sudan, one at Mongalla, and the other five factories located in the north at Ed Duiem, Kadugli, Kosti, Nyala, and Shendi. An agreement was made with a Belgian firm, SOBERI, to supply the weaving factory of 256 looms {{and at one point}} it was estimated to produce around 9 million meters of <b>grey</b> <b>fabric</b> per annum, but it failed to get past the trial phase due to lack of raw materials, capital, and transportation facilities.|$|E

40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the issue}} {{related to the}} influence of finishing on fabrics, made of yarn of different raw material, by research of mechanical and end-use properties. The issue is relevant to textile companies that manufacture fabrics from various natural fibres and its blends. During the manufacturing process, it has been noticed that finishing has a negative effect on end-use properties, such as abrasion resistance and pilling. Moreover, finishing has an impact on mechanical properties of fibres, such as breaking force and elongation at break. Therefore, this work analyses the abovementioned mechanical (breaking force and elongation at break) properties of yarn and fabrics made of it and end-use (abrasion resistance and pilling) properties of <b>grey</b> <b>fabrics</b> and finished fabrics. It has been determined that the strength and tension rates of used yarn have an impact on fabrics and its breaking force and elongation at break. The fabric finishing affects the properties of the mentioned fabrics, i. e. breaking force decreases after finishing, while the elongation at break increases. During finishing, fabrics undergo various chemical and mechanical impacts which might decrease the quality of fabrics. On the other hand, fabrics become denser, its threads crimp, and thus fabrics become more tensile. Finishing affects end-use fabric properties as well (resistance to abrasion and pilling). These properties of fabrics worsen. Dependencies are described by linear equations. During the abrasion resistance analysis, almost all of the dependencies were strong. Abrasion resistance of <b>grey</b> <b>fabrics</b> was higher than those after finishing. Pilling resistance of <b>grey</b> <b>fabrics</b> is also better than of fabrics after finishing. Pilling resistance dependencies on the number of abrasion cycles were mostly of medium strength. It might be concluded that finishing and the raw material of used yarn influences the mechanical (breaking force, elongation at break) and end-use (abrasion resistance and pilling) properties of fabrics...|$|R

There {{is a tendency to}} use more amount of water than required while removing the residual chemicals during rinsing [16]. To fulfil the objective, an unprocessed <b>grey</b> <b>fabric</b> was subjected to combined pre-treatment and dyeing process which was carried out using all the conventional chemicals in the same bath. Successful attempt were also made to dye fabrics at grey stage, desized stage and scoured stage.

Though the absorbency time of grey dyed fabric is more, one can utilise these fabrics depending on their end use, e.g. upholstery fabric, technical textiles, etc. where a good absorbency is not of utmost importance. We also should take into notice that this can tremendously save water, chemicals and energy required for processing a fabric for making it ready for dyeing.|$|E

30|$|Based on this {{experimental}} study, it can {{be concluded}} that warp density and weft density of denim fabric were changed due to change in position of whip roller both in horizontal and vertical way. That’s why areal density was also affected by backrest roller position. Warp way crimp% gradually decreased with increasing height at fixed depth of whip roller both in grey and finished state while it showed vice versa result with increasing depth at fixed height in both state of fabric. The sample made at height position of + 12 and depth 5 showed maximum warp crimp% value of 13.33 and 16.36 in grey and finished state respectively. Weft way crimp% also showed a significant result in finished state. The maximum finished weft crimp% value found at the position of + 16 height and depth 4 was 7.8. The position of whip roller affects <b>grey</b> <b>fabric’s</b> weft way crimp% slightly. Warp way tensile strength tremendously increased with ascending of whip roller position. But after a certain position again it gradually decreased in both state. Warp strength had a similar relation with decreasing depth position of whip roller in fixed height. The maximum warp strength value for <b>grey</b> and finished <b>fabric</b> were 761.77 N and 688.06 N respectively found at height position of + 14 and depth position of 4. No significant effect was found on weft strength, width wise shrinkage and skewness of denim <b>fabric</b> both in <b>grey</b> and finished state due to change in settings of whip roller. Air permeability of denim fabric simultaneously decreased with increasing height of whip roller but after a certain position it started to increase. This trend was found for both (<b>grey</b> and finished) <b>fabric</b> at fixed depth position of whip roller. But air permeability changed in inversely proportional way with variable depth at constant height position of whip roller. The highest value of air permeability (in cm 3 /s/cm 2) for grey and finished denim was found 160.42 and 156.94 respectively at the position of height + 8 and depth 4. Width wise fabric shrinkage gradually increased with increasing height position of whip roller at fixed depth and similarly decreased with decreasing depth of whip roller at fixed height setting but only in case of grey state. The maximum value of shrinkage% was 12.6 at height + 12 and depth 3. In finishing state of fabric, shrinkage% had so negligible value due to different finishing treatment. Generally whip roller setting is kept unchanged in different woven fabric production. But it directly affects EPcm and PPcm which change the cover factor of fabric. Moreover, the research result shows that it also deviates different physical properties of fabric. So if this position is optimized, fabric properties can be enriched as well as faults can be minimized.|$|R

40|$|Textile {{industry}} {{has an important}} impact in world economy and consequently on environmental quality of life. Textile processing uses huge amount of water, chemicals and energy and it is quite easy to conclude about the enormous meaning of pollution control and rationalization of energetic demands. CORONA treatment in the wet processing of cotton textile materials has a great potential concerning the improvement of all the operations included in it, namely in preparation, dyeing, printing or final finishing. Physical and chemical surface changes in cotton structure are noticed after CORONA discharge. The increase in oxidation potential {{and the creation of}} channels through cuticle are referred as responsible for the variation in cotton properties after plasmatic discharge, specially concerning absorption of water and treatment baths. Advantages as the use of less chemicals, namely alkalis, oxidants and other auxiliaries, the reduction of times and temperatures, less damages in the materials surely can have a strong impact in economical and ecological aspects of the process. Complete hidrophilization of cellulosic materials renders very easy the access of baths and consequently conditions to more efficient operations are found. Bleaching processes aim to give textile materials the adequate whiteness degree, the removal of sizing agents, the increase of hidrophility and cleaning by extraction of seeds, husks and waxes. The use of hydrogen peroxide in alkaline medium is a flexible and more ecological process when compared with methods based in chlorinated compounds.

It can also be seen that a <b>grey</b> unprocessed <b>fabric</b> can also be dyed with acceptable properties as of the RFD fabric.
