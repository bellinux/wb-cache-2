This study examines {{the extent to which}} the ineffectiveness of <b>enterprise</b> <b>policy</b> can be attributed to the way it has been implemented. Interviews with central government policy-makers, Regional Development Agency staff and business development managers in local enterprise agencies during the Labour administration (2007 - 2010) revealed that the implementation process of <b>enterprise</b> <b>policy</b> initiatives is complex and confusing, with fragmented relationships between the actors involved. The abundance of <b>enterprise</b> <b>policy</b> initiatives being delivered at the time, the absence of clearly defined objectives, the limited emphasis on the delivery of business support and the lack of measurement and evaluation combined to create an unnecessarily complicated process of <b>enterprise</b> <b>policy</b> implementation which, in turn, reduced its effectiveness...|$|R

In its current form European <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Policy</b> focuses on the promotion of small and medium enterprises as a panacea for economic growth, innovative capacity, productivity gains and job creation. The {{first part of the}} article places European <b>Enterprise</b> <b>Policy</b> within a wider political economy, and draws attention to the notions of competitiveness and enterprise embedded in current policy discourse. The second part of the discussion examines more closely issues of integration, governance and spatial development, arguing that awareness of spatial dynamics is, at the moment, a missing element in this policy framework.

40|$|Given {{that most}} economies {{are now in}} recession, policymakers are looking to small firms to act as engines of {{economic}} growth; {{this has led to}} a revived interest in the role of <b>enterprise</b> <b>policy.</b> The 'new' <b>enterprise</b> <b>policy</b> is systemic, promoting and shaping externalities and capabilities. At its core are R&D, innovation and education. It encapsulates a shift from direct intervention towards creating an enabling environment for small firms and entrepreneurship. At present there is a research lacuna regarding the evaluation of such policies. The aim {{of this paper is to}} fill this gap by making two key contributions. First, I demonstrate that traditional enterprise evaluation metrics are too narrow: they focus almost exclusively on private firm impacts, rather than broader societal impacts caused by the pervasive nature of 'new' <b>enterprise</b> <b>policies.</b> Second, I illustrate how logic models could be expanded to account for these broader impacts.

40|$|Entrepreneurship {{policy has}} been criticised for its lack of effectiveness. Some scholars, such as Scott Shane in this journal, have argued that it is ‘bad’ public policy.

To answer this question this study examines the UK’s <b>enterprise</b> <b>policy</b> process in the 2009 – 2010 period. It suggests that a key factor for the ineffectiveness of policy is how it is formulated. This stage in the policy process is seldom visible to those outside of government departments and has been largely ignored by prior research. The application of institutional theory provides a detailed theoretical understanding of the actors and {{the process by which}} <b>enterprise</b> <b>policy</b> is formulated.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explore the logic of {{actually}} existing austerity {{and its effects on}} the development of <b>enterprise</b> <b>policy</b> in the Republic of Ireland. It asks the following question: in what manner has <b>enterprise</b> <b>policy</b> been affected by the Irish experience of austerity? Neoliberal austerity is not merely state parsimony; after all the austerity of post-WWII United Kingdom, with its frugal construction of national health and welfare systems, is far from the austerity advocated by Merkel and Cameron today. In light of this, there are a large number of factors which have led to the unique development of actually existing austerity in the Republic of Ireland, factors such as the small and open nature of the Irish economy and the over-reliance on FDI; yet an obvious factor in understanding austerity is <b>enterprise</b> <b>policy.</b> As the neoliberal mantra goes, without a thriving and innovative private sector from which to collect revenue, the state cannot fund public services; the public sector is thus wholly subsumed by the market which acts as the ultimate arbiter of veridiction in matters of policy. In light of this, the question of how the state fosters enterprise in a climate of austerity is a proposition which merits exploration. Through a corpus linguistic analysis of key policy texts, this paper seeks to uncover the manner in which <b>enterprise</b> <b>policy</b> has been affected in light of the Irish experience of austerity...|$|R

40|$|Objectives • To {{review the}} {{literature}} on <b>enterprise</b> <b>policy</b> and purposive sustainability transitions • To present comparative case-based analyses of entrepreneurial activity in different transitions • To draw out the implications for research, policy and practice Prior Work Our paper is framed around the socio-technical transitions literature, with a particular focus on entrepreneurship and <b>enterprise</b> <b>policy.</b> It builds on previous work, in which we challenged pre-conceptions {{about the role of}} entrepreneurial actors in purposive sustainability transitions. In this paper, we build on these themes and draw out the implications for SME and entrepreneurship policies in Europe. Approach We conduct a critical review of recent policy developments, with selected case-based illustrations that involve various kinds of purposive sustainability transition. This concludes with a brief reflection on the main similarities and differences in terms of governance mechanisms and entrepreneurship infrastructures. We note that, while cross-national agreements, such as EU-ETS and the European Small Business Act, provide overarching frameworks, there is considerable variety in <b>enterprise</b> <b>policies</b> at a national level (e. g. goals, approaches, target audiences, performance), which overlay, and interact with, pre-existing geographic variations in entrepreneurial activity. Results Our argument is based around the following observations: (i) there is a groundswell of entrepreneurial activity oriented towards environmental sustainability; (ii) many governments have recognised that entrepreneurs can be key actors in the design and delivery of sustainability initiatives; (iii) transitions scholars have already highlighted many specific instances of entrepreneurial agency; (iv) there is now an urgent requirement to consolidate and build on this evidence base, in order to draw out practical implications for <b>enterprise</b> <b>policy</b> conception and implementation. Implications Traditionally, <b>enterprise</b> <b>policies</b> have been framed and evaluated with a primary focus on economic criteria, such as job creation and economic growth. A new set of challenges arises when governments seek to reorient policy around more ambitious and multi-faceted sustainability goals. For example: evidence on the long-term outcomes of previous policy initiatives are mixed, whether at firm-level or across geographic regions; there are difficulties in isolating the impact of particular policies even when relevant statistical measures and datasets (e. g. for unemployment and GDP) are generally available; and policies are now being developed in a much wider range of contexts, including newly-industrialised and developing countries. Value The study is designed to inform future research and policy-making. It makes connections between the socio-technical transitions literature and relevant research on entrepreneurship and <b>enterprise</b> <b>policy,</b> in pursuit of entrepreneurial activities that contribute to more effective and equitable sustainability transitions...|$|R

This paper looks at how enterprise has evolved in Cleveland/Tees Valley over the past three decades. It suggests - and finds - that businesses in the 1980 s were more numerous but of lower 'quality' (even if the influence of unemployment is accounted for) than those from the 1970 s and 1990 s. This implies that we should be cautious about the value of policy attempts to increase business formation rates in areas such as Cleveland/Tees Valley...|$|R
