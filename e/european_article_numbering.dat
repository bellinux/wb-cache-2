40|$|Abstract: Pharmacy {{inventory}} management (PIM) comprises business activities which are {{connected with the}} size and placement of stocked drugs. To manage minimal and maximal drugs stock, orders dynamics etc., pharmacies must track expiration dates of each drug in stock. Outdated drugs can’t be counted as stock and produce lot of costs, especially for their disposal. The most number of pharmacies in Bosnia use <b>European</b> <b>Article</b> <b>Numbering</b> (EAN 13) barcode by which is impossible to define drug expiration dates. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) enables full automatization of PIM, {{but it is still}} not in use, mostly because of high costs of implementation of this system. In our research we have observed 52 Bosnian pharmacies and presented another approach to barcode technology which can be used in automatization of PIM. As the base we have used existing EAN 13 code, adding 6 digits for expiration dates. We have successfully created and tested program for extraction of EAN 13 and expiration dates from that barcode using separate files in database to keep inputs, outputs and stocks of each item by expiration dates...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Within {{the coming}} years, low cost radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) systems are expected to become commonplace throughout the business-to-business and business-to-consumer marketplace. Much of the work to date on these systems pertains to systems engineering and electronic product code issues. This paper discusses ways to ensure personal privacy, and presents policies and technologies that could limit abuse. Introduction to RFID “Automatic Identification ” (Auto-ID) describes a wide class of technologies used for automatically identifying objects, individuals, and locations. Typical Auto-ID systems assign a code to a product model or type. This code can then be automatically read and manipulated by an information processing system.

40|$|The {{advent of}} modern {{technology}} has brought {{a new dimension to}} the power of number theory: constant practical use. Once considered the purest of pure mathematics, it is used increasingly now in the rapid development of technology in a number of areas, such as art, coding theory, cryptology, computer science, and other necessities of modern life. Elementary Number Theory with Applications is the fruit of years of dreams and the author 2 ̆ 7 s fascination with the subject, encapsulating the beauty, elegance, historical development, and opportunities provided for experimentation and application. This is the only number theory book to show how modular systems can be employed to create beautiful designs, thus linking number theory with both geometry and art. It is also the only number theory book to deal with bar codes, Zip codes, International Standard Book <b>Numbers</b> (ISBN), and <b>European</b> <b>Article</b> <b>Numbers</b> (EAN). Emphasis is on problem-solving strategies (doing experiments, collecting and organizing data, recognizing patterns, and making conjectures). Each section provides a wealth of carefully prepared, well-graded examples and exercises to enhance the readers 2 ̆ 7 understanding and problem-solving skills[URL]...|$|R
40|$|This project {{describes}} {{the process of}} creating a cross-platform application, starting into an Android app and a web page designed to control food intolerances users. The system will control a full database of products, its composition and manage all user queries entering a EAN code (<b>European</b> <b>Article</b> <b>Number)</b> of a product or food. EAN is a 13 -digit bar code symbology, which is a superset of the original UPC (Universal Product Code), and adopted by over 100 countries and nearly one million businesses and printed on all products that can be purchased at stores in our country. The application will acquire this code by mobile phone camera (Android version) or by directly entering (all versions). It will also allow the user to incorporate all intolerances into the system, warning us about the danger of consuming any product or component stored as harmful in the app. The aim is to create a separate 3 -tier application where logic and storage of information are in unique and separate layers, detached of the presentation layer, since in our design we have two different fronts: on the one hand, a website and the other an Android app. This way, the effort required for implementation is substantially reduced, since it is only necessary to duplicate work in very specific parts, the both fronts. The final products are an Android app, a web page, a SaaS-based webservice that will manage both logic, a database system and a description of the most significant parts of the process...|$|R

This network will have a number of important characteristics. First, unlike conventional bar-codxN this system will network physical objects without human intervention or manipulation by automatic machines. Second the network will be seamless. In other wordr it will operate continuously throughout the environment rather than just at the checkout or exit, as with current scanningand Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) systems. Third the network will be relatively inexpensive. Although it was technically possible to create such a network in the past, new technologies make its practical implementation a reality. Fourth, the network will be ubiquitous, operating in manydLqM se environments [...] from manufacturing plantsand dtswBHBOMw centers to retail establishmentsand homes.
