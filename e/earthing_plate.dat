5000|$|For MF and HF use, {{the most}} common antenna design is to add two RF {{insulators}} into the backstay of the mast and feed it from the transceiver using a sintered bronze <b>earthing</b> <b>plate,</b> bolted {{to the outside of}} the hull, well under the waterline, as an earth. On metal hulled boats the <b>earthing</b> <b>plate</b> can be dispensed with, and the whole hull used as a ground. In this case, the thickness of any paint layer is entirely negligible at RF. On a yacht with twin backstays, if insulators are placed in both of them and they are fed from the masthead, they may be usable as an [...] "inverted vee" [...] avoiding the need to feed the antenna against ground. Either format will require the use of an ATU (Antenna Tuning Unit) to achieve resonance for the HF frequency in use, as the physical length of the antenna will almost invariably be incorrect at the frequency of choice. A few twin-masted sailing vessels have the space to erect a [...] "Tee" [...] antenna or an inverted [...] "L" [...] between masts. These antenna configurations are more common on merchant ships.|$|E
50|$|Once a good {{connection}} to the sea water has been established, {{it is necessary to}} make a good RF connection from the transceiver and ATU to the grounding system. While it might seem that a good, thick wire is all that is needed, for large RF currents it is usually recommended that copper grounding tape is used. This is not because thick wires {{will not be able to}} support the currents involved, but because it is more likely that RF currents will remain flowing along something that has a wide surface area without re-transmitting themselves along the way due to skin effect. The key pathway from the ATU of a single-ended antenna system to the <b>earthing</b> <b>plate,</b> or the hull earth-point, should be as short and as straight as possible. This should be considered from the start when deciding where to mount the various components within the hull. There is not much that the installer can do about the losses in, and the efficiencies of, the transceiver, the ATU, the antenna or its feed, but extra effort put into the efficiency of the earthing paths will pay much bigger dividends, in terms of radiated power and freedom from EMC problems later, than any other single aspect of the installation. The salty sea makes an exceptionally good ground plane, and effort put into achieving a good {{connection to}} it will be handsomely repaid.|$|E

25|$|Many Rare Earth proponents {{argue that}} the <b>Earth's</b> <b>plate</b> {{tectonics}} would probably not exist {{if not for the}} tidal forces of the Moon. The hypothesis that the Moon's tidal influence initiated or sustained <b>Earth's</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics remains unproven, though at least one study implies a temporal correlation to the formation of the Moon. Evidence for the past existence of plate tectonics on planets like Mars which may never have had a large moon would counter this argument. Kasting argues that a large moon is not required to initiate plate tectonics.|$|R

50|$|The {{landscape}} at {{that time}} was loose glacial till so the large amounts of glacier melt water eroded deep valleys over thousands of years.

Some {{structures}} and their relationships, positions {{in space and}} shifts represent the structural set of an area, as included within regional units, and smaller or larger portions of the earth’s crust known as the <b>Earth’s</b> <b>plates</b> and micro plates.
