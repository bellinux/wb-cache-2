These sweep circuits remained dormant, with the CRT beam cut off, until a <b>drive</b> <b>pulse</b> from an external device unblanked the CRT {{and started a}} constant-speed horizontal trace; the calibrated speed permitted measurement of time intervals.

Prior to commenting on D'banj's exit from Mo' Hits, there were allegations that D'banj signed over Mo' Hits to Don Jazzy. In an interview with Sunday Punch, Don Jazzy addressed D'banj's departure from Mo Hits, saying: [...] "We were working together and all was going on well. It got to a point where ’I’ looked at the situation and we both decided that it was not working and we had to move on." [...] Don Jazzy alluded to being hesitant of a name change. According to BellaNaija, the term [...] "Mavin" [...] describes someone who is gifted and skilled in any field. Upon establishing the rebranded record label, Don Jazzy said he sees Mavin Records being the power house of Music in Africa in the shortest possible time. After re-branding Mo' Hits to Mavin, Don Jazzy signed Nigerian singer Tiwa Savage. Pulse reported that Don Jazzy admires the singer's work ethic and <b>drive.</b> <b>Pulse</b> also reported that Mavin Records signed Aluko Altims Timothy and Sunday BabyFresh Enejere to the label. On May 7, 2012, the record label launched its official website and introduced their fans to the Mavin league (a social networking site designed to cater to their fans worldwide). Don Jazzy signed endorsement deals with Samsung and Loya Milk after establishing the label. Tiwa Savage also signed an endorsement deal with Pepsi. On February 14, 2015, Don Jazzy announced the addition of Di'Ja to Mavin Records. On February 21, 2014, it was reported that Reekado Banks signed a record deal with Mavin Records. On February 28, 2014, Don Jazzy unveiled Korede Bello as another signee to Mavin Records. On February 25, 2015, Don Jazzy and Tiwa Savage both signed endorsement deals with Konga.com. On October 31, 2016, several media outlets in Nigeria reported that Iyanya signed a record deal with Mavin Records. Both Iyanya and Don Jazzy confirmed the report via Instagram. On February 28, 2017, Don Jazzy announced the signings of Johnny Drille, Poe and the DNA Twins to Mavin Records.|$|E

In order to reduce vibration andor attitude error, the <b>drive</b> <b>pulses</b> are generated by a clock down-counter (312) with variable count ratio.

When a direction change is commanded, a flag signal generator (350) disables the selectable memories, and enables a further store (360), which generates a count ratio representing a very slow solar panel rotational rate, so that the rotational rate always slows to a low value before direction is changed.

The main findings are: (1) an LPA driven in the blowout regime by 30 TW, 30 fs laser pulses producesnot only a high-quality, tunable, quasi-monoenergetic electron beam, but also a high-quality, relativistically intense (a 0 ~ 1) spent <b>drive</b> <b>pulse</b> that remains stable in profile and intensity over the LPA tuning range. (2) A thin plastic film near the gas jet exit retro-reflects the spent <b>drive</b> <b>pulse</b> efficiently into oncoming electrons to produce CBS x-rays without detectable bremsstrahlung background. Meanwhile anomalous far-field divergence of the retro-reflected light demonstrates relativistic "denting" of the PM. Exploiting these optimized LPA and PM conditions, we demonstrate quasi-monoenergetic (50 % FWHM energy spread), tunable (75 to 200 KeV) CBS x-rays, characteristics previously achieved only on more powerful laser systems by CBS of a split-off, counter-propagating pulse. Moreover, laser-to-x-ray photon conversion efficiency ~ 6 e 12 exceeds that of any previous LPA-based quasi-monoenergetic Compton source.

40|$|The laser and optics {{system for}} the photon {{collider}} seeks to minimize the required laser power by using an optical stacking cavity to recirculate the laser light. An enhancement of between 300 to 400 is desired. In order to achieve this the laser <b>pulses</b> which <b>drive</b> the cavity must precisely match the phase of the pulse circulating within the cavity. We report on simulations {{of the performance of}} a stacking cavity to various variations of the drive laser in order to specify the required tolerances of the laser system. We look at the behavior of a simple four mirror cavity as shown in Fig. 1. As a unit input pulse is applied to the coupling mirror a pulse begins to build up in the interior of the cavity. If the <b>drive</b> <b>pulses</b> and the interior pulse arrive at the coupling mirror in phase the interior pulse will build up to a larger value. The achievable enhancement is a strong function of the reflectivity of the cavities.
