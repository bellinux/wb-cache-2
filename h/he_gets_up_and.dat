25|$|Akin {{arrives in}} Owerri {{and asks for}} the ticket to Abuja, but he is told there's no flight {{scheduled}} for Abuja {{for the rest of}} the day.

Akin asks Mary to go to his mother's house in Abuja, Akin also finds himself in Mary's Father's house which is a very ancient house.

Mary is also received happily by Akin's mother, Kike (Joke Silva) and she believed Mary is Akin's girlfriend. Mary tries to explain to her what happened, but she is too overjoyed to listen. Akin finds it hard to adapt to the life in the Village: He asks the family for a cutlery to eat 'swallow' food and he is laughed at, He is also unable to sleep with the others on bed and goes to sleep on the veranda. He finds it hard to sleep on the Veranda again due to mosquitoes. <b>He</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> calls Mary instead and they get to discuss many things like the fact that her sister's sin is that she beats her husband and she's accused of pulling her husband's penis this time around. Mary asks Akin to speak to Cynthia on her behalf because she thinks Cynthia will listen to him as Cynthia seems to like him. Akin also asks Mary to go to the company's retreat on his behalf.

At the meeting she kneels down for the Elders and apologizes to everyone in a sober state and eventually bursts into tears.|$|E
500|$|The {{video is}} shot as one long take, {{shot in a}} mostly dark room. Ocean sits in the room, smoking an {{unspecified}} drug. Eventually, <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> begins to smear an unknown substance onto his face. Random shots of pandas and rain forest imagery are also spliced into the video, and it ends with Ocean being slapped by the ghostly image of a woman. MTV further summarized the video; [...] "Ocean is surrounded by ghostly incarnations of beautiful women, tigers and pandas. At one point, Ocean smears {{what appears to be}} novocaine — or Procaine — on his solemn-looking face." [...] Supposedly, it required several takes to achieve the correct angle for the slapping moment, and the spliced images were placed in the video because Ocean asked the director whether or not they [...] "can we put some kind of Asian-rain-forest stuff in there?" [...] Billboard wrote that the video was [...] "minimalist" [...] and [...] "eerie". Pitchfork named the video amongst the best of the year.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't stand this," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{throwing}} {{the book from}} him right across the drawing-room floor; [...] "and, by heavens! I won't stand it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{fellow in}} your song. Lay him doon and dee! Finely he'd show off before the girl by doing THAT. A sniveller! Why couldn't <b>he</b> <b>get</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> punch somebody's head!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{very glad}} to see you; I am indeed," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> putting {{out his hand to}} her. [...] "But I really never knew why you went away." ...|$|R

6000|$|NAPOLEON (laughing grimly and {{pinching}} her cheek). That is the {{one question}} you must never ask a soldier. The sergeant asks after the recruit's height, his age, his wind, his limb, but never after his courage. (<b>He</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> walks about with his hands behind him and his head bowed, chuckling to himself.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{neither does}} nor doesn't. She is the harlot, the actual harlot of {{adultery}} to him. And he's got a craving to throw {{himself into the}} filth of her. Then <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> calls on {{the name of the}} lily of purity, the baby-faced girl, and so enjoys himself all round. It's the old story--action and reaction, and nothing between.' ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the ninth}} round Wepner scored a knockdown, which Ali claimed had {{occurred}} because Wepner was stepping on his foot. Wepner {{went to his}} corner and said to his manager, [...] "Al, start the car. We're going to the bank. We are millionaires." [...] To which Wepner's manager replied, [...] "You better turn around. <b>He's</b> <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> looks pissed off." ...|$|R
6000|$|He made a queer, whining sound, {{covering}} his face. And the beggar's tag: [...] "'Ave a feelin' 'eart, gentleman--'ave a feelin' 'eart!" [...] passed idiotically through Gyp's mind. Would <b>he</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> strangle her? Should she dash to the door--escape? For a long, miserable moment, {{she watched him}} swaying on the window-seat, with his face covered. Then, without looking at her, he crammed a clenched hand up against his mouth, and rushed out.|$|R
6000|$|... "You’re {{all being}} made fools of," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> stamping. [...] "I {{tell you he}} pushed me over-board for the purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well,--no,--you didn't; {{but they}} do, you know. What does a country gentleman know, {{and what does}} he do? What's the country the better of him? He 'unts, and he shoots, and he goes to bed with his skin full of wine, and then <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> he 'unts and he shoots again, and 'as his skin full once more. That's about all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to know, Martin Sanders," [...] said Matlack, [...] "that I don't pitch into a man when he's in his bed, {{no matter what it}} is that made him take to his bed or stay there. But I'll just say to you now, that when <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> shows himself, there'll be the biggest case of bounce in these parts that you ever saw." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were indeed}} as unsavoury in {{appearance}} {{as they were}} brutal in manner. Water is scarce in the Transvaal, and is used most sparingly for all purposes of cleanliness. The Boer sleeps in his clothes, gives himself a shake when <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> his toilet is completed, unless on very exceptional occasions when he goes outside {{the door to the}} water- cask, fills his hands with water, and rubs them over his face.|$|E
500|$|What {{happens in}} that moment? [...] Does he despair? [...] Does <b>he</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> go on? For me, {{there is no}} more {{defining}} moment for a character. We tried to do this with almost all the characters in this episode: , Laura, Kara, Lee. We ripped everything out from under them then sat back to see what they would do. What were their individual breaking points? And if they did break, would they stay broken or grope toward a recovery? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} injuries," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> walking about the room. [...] "But I am sure of this. You {{will have to}} be my wife." ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{may have}} been easier to tell the man {{something}} than to demand <b>he</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> walk. Jesus chooses to prove his ability to forgive sins, with {{a demonstration of the}} man's ability to walk. He forgives and heals by word alone, highlighting the power of his words. Mark says that [...] "everyone" [...] was amazed by this. We are not informed whether this included the teachers of the law or the [...] "obstinate" [...] Pharisees who, it is intimated, had hardened hearts due to sin, self righteouness and [...] "man-made" [...] teachings.|$|R
6000|$|... "I says to Simon, 'What a shame!' but afore {{the words}} {{was out of}} my mouth, Master Walsham he hits him, and hits him hard, too. Then there was a fight, but Master Horton, he hadn't a chance with James, who gave him as sound a licking as ever you see'd, and ending with {{knocking}} him backwards into the pool. Then <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> shakes his fist at James, and then goes off as hard as he could. That's all I know about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Like, Babie? Like {{anything}} {{long and}} limp {{you can think}} of. He sits all in a coil and twist, and you don't think there's much of him; but when <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> pulls himself upright, you go looking and looking till you don't know where's the top of him, till you see a thin white face in washed-out hair. He is a good fellow, awfully kind, and I suppose he can't help being such a tremendous-—" [...] John hesitated, in deference to his father, for a word that was not slang, and finally chose [...] "don." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, {{by and by}} {{the king}} <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> comes forward a little, and works himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and flapdoodle about its being a sore trial {{for him and his}} poor brother to lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four {{thousand}} mile, but it's a trial that's sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother's heart, because out of their mouths they can't, words being too weak and cold, {{and all that kind of}} rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he blubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust.|$|E
60|$|Charley assured {{his father}} that he was almost well, and much the better of having Kate to tend him. In fact, he felt so much revived that he said <b>he</b> would <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{go out for a}} walk.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got {{a little}} library here," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> raising the shades and opening the glass doors of a {{bookcase}} which had escaped my attention. He took down a volume of Carlyle, bound in half calf.|$|R
50|$|Although Henry {{has been}} in love with her for years, <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> fed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> spends his time on their honeymoon with his old girlfriend, wealthy Helen Van Orden (Claudia Dell), and a bevy of beauties.|$|R
6000|$|... "We did an' we didn't. The fifth {{night after}} he was missing we heard a fearful noise right in a cage wot had a lion in it. We run to the place with shootin' irons an' spears and capstan bars, thinkin' the lion was loose. When we got there we found the orang outang had twisted one o' the bars o' the cage loose an' got inside and {{disturbed}} Mr. Lion's best nap. Mr. Lion didn't like it, an' <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> in about two minutes he makes mince meat o' the orang outang. When we got there all we see was bits o' skin, an' the feet an' head o' the orang outang, yes, sir. We was glad he was gone--especially the cap'n wife --but the circus men was mad to lose sech a valerable beast," [...] concluded Bahama Bill.|$|E
60|$|He {{was going}} to reply, and had {{said that he was}} sorry I could not be persuaded, and was a-going to say more, but he heard his sister a-coming, and so did I; and yet I forced out these few words as a reply, that I could never be persuaded to love one brother and marry another. He shook his head and said, 'Then I am ruined,' meaning himself; and that moment his sister entered the room and told him she could not find the flute. 'Well,' says he merrily, 'this laziness won't do'; so <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> goes himself to go to look for it, but comes back without it too; not but that he could have found it, but because his mind was a little disturbed, and he had no mind to play; and, besides, the errand he sent his sister on was {{answered}} another way; for he only wanted an opportunity to speak to me, which he gained, though not much to his satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|Most unexpected, {{the mystery}} come out {{one day at}} Egham Races. The Public was shy of bein pulled in, and Chops was ringin his little bell out of his drawing-room winder, and was snarlin to me over his {{shoulder}} as he kneeled down with his legs out at the back-door--for he couldn't be shoved into his house without kneeling down, and the premises wouldn't accommodate his legs--was snarlin, [...] "Here's a precious Public for you; why the Devil don't they tumble up?" [...] when {{a man in the}} crowd holds up a carrier-pigeon, and cries out, [...] "If there's any person here as has got a ticket, the Lottery's just drawed, and the number as has come up for the great prize is three, seven, forty-two! Three, seven, forty-two!" [...] I was givin the man to the Furies myself, for calling off the Public's attention--for the Public will turn away, at any time, to look at anything in preference to the thing showed 'em; and if you doubt it, get 'em together for any indiwidual purpose {{on the face of the}} earth, and send only two people in late, and see if the whole company an't far more interested in takin particular notice of them two than of you--I say, I wasn't best pleased with the man for callin out, and wasn't blessin him in my own mind, when I see Chops's little bell fly out of winder at a old lady, and <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> kicks his box over, exposin the whole secret, and he catches hold of the calves of my legs and he says to me, [...] "Carry me into the wan, Toby, and throw a pail of water over me or I'm a dead man, for I've come into my property!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So, young gentleman," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{extending}} his hand, [...] "are {{you come to}} breakfast with me in good fellowship, or to spoil my meal this morning, as you did my supper last night, by asking untimely questions?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> {{suddenly}} <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> walks about. LADY CHESHIRE, too, moves [...] {{over to the}} fireplace, {{and after}} an uneasy look at him, turns to [...] the fire. Then, {{as if trying to}} switch of his mood, she changes [...] the subject abruptly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{put on some}} of {{the polite}} outside habiliments of {{external}} society and went into Rufe's room. <b>He</b> had <b>gotten</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> lit his lamp, and was pouring some milk into a tin pan on the floor for a dingy-white, half-grown, squealing pig.|$|R
6000|$|... "As to {{picking up}} the fruit, that's as may be," [...] said Mr. Supplehouse. Was he not the man to save the nation; and if so, why should he not pick up the fruit himself? Had not the {{greatest}} power in the country pointed him out as such a saviour? What though {{the country at the}} present moment needed no more saving, might there not, nevertheless, be a good time coming? Were there not rumours of other wars still prevalent--if indeed the actual war then going on was being brought to a close without his assistance by some other species of salvation? He thought of that country to which he had pointed, and of that friend of his enemies, and remembered that there might be still work for a mighty saviour. The public mind was now awake, and understood what it was about. When a man gets into his head an idea that the public voice calls for him, it is astonishing how greet becomes his trust in the wisdom of the public. Vox populi, vox Dei. [...] "Has it not been so always?" [...] he says to himself, as <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> as he goes to bed. And then Mr. Supplehouse felt that he was the master mind there at Gatherum Castle, and that those there were all puppets in his hand. It is such a pleasant thing to feel that one's friends are puppets, and that the strings are in one's own possession. But what if Mr. Supplehouse himself were a puppet? Some months afterwards, when the much-belaboured head of affairs was in very truth made to retire, when unkind shells were thrown in against him in great numbers, when he exclaimed, [...] "Et tu, Brute!" [...] till the words were stereotyped upon his lips, all men in all places talked much about the great Gatherum Castle confederation. The Duke of Omnium, the world said, had taken into his high consideration the state of affairs, and seeing with his eagle's eye that the welfare of his countrymen at large required that some great step should be initiated, he had at once summoned to his mansion many members of the Lower House, and some also of the House of Lords,--mention was here especially made of the all-venerable and all-wise Lord Boanerges; and men {{went on to say that}} there, in deep conclave, he had made known to them his views. It was thus agreed that the head of affairs, Whig as he was, must fall. The country required it, and the duke did his duty. This was the beginning, the world said, of that celebrated confederation, by which the ministry was overturned, and--as the Goody Twoshoes added--the country saved. But the Jupiter took all the credit to itself; and the Jupiter was not far wrong. All the credit was due to the Jupiter--in that, as in everything else.|$|E
50|$|In the office, the geezer is napping. Momentarily, <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{heads to}} the egg-packaging place to check the cat's work. To his horror, he sees the mess piling up which {{indicate}} hundreds of dollars in losses.|$|E
5000|$|Duma {{also appears}} at the funeral of Dream of the Endless in The Wake, where <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> [...] "speaks", but being the angel of silence, simply sheds a single tear which {{effectively}} communicates his feelings to all those present.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know, my dear," [...] she answered, blushing, [...] "since {{about this}} matter {{he is very}} strange and obstinate. Do you know {{that all the time}} you were absent he never {{mentioned}} your name, and if anyone else spoke it <b>he</b> would <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> go away!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{could not}} say, [...] "Mara, I have done wrong," [...] though he every day {{meant to do}} it, and {{sometimes}} sat an hour in her presence, feeling murky and stony, as if possessed by a dumb spirit; then <b>he</b> would <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> fling stormily out of the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Yes,' <b>he</b> ses, <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> walking {{backwards}} and forwards; 'especially as Mrs. Plimmer is {{always talking about}} coming down to see the ship.
