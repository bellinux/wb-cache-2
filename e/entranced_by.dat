5|$|The {{presence}} {{of death is}} felt throughout the poem, although it is mentioned explicitly only in the final line. The moon, {{a symbol of the}} beloved, sinks steadily as the poem progresses, until its abrupt drop in the penultimate stanza. That the speaker links Lucy with the moon is clear, though his reasons are unclear. The moon nevertheless plays {{a significant role in the}} action of the poem: as the lover imagines the moon slowly sinking behind Lucy's cottage, he is <b>entranced</b> <b>by</b> its motion. By the fifth stanza, the speaker has been lulled into a somnambulistic trance—he sleeps while still keeping his eyes on the moon (lines 17–20).|$|E
5|$|According to medieval scholar Richard Zeikowitz, the Green Knight {{represents}} {{a threat to}} homosocial friendship in his medieval world. Zeikowitz argues that the narrator of the poem seems <b>entranced</b> <b>by</b> the Knight's beauty, homoeroticising him in poetic form. The Green Knight's attractiveness challenges the homosocial rules of King Arthur's court and {{poses a threat to}} their way of life. Zeikowitz also states that Gawain seems to find Bertilak as attractive as the narrator finds the Green Knight. Bertilak, however, follows the homosocial code and develops a friendship with Gawain. Gawain's embracing and kissing Bertilak in several scenes thus represents not a homosexual but a homosocial expression. Men of the time often embraced and kissed and this was acceptable under the chivalric code. Nonetheless, the Green Knight blurs the lines between homosociality and homosexuality, representing the difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating the two.|$|E

25|$|In 1950, LaVey met Carole Lansing {{and they}} married the {{following}} year. Lansing {{gave birth to}} LaVey's first daughter, Karla LaVey, born in 1952. They divorced in 1960 after LaVey became <b>entranced</b> <b>by</b> Diane Hegarty. Hegarty and LaVey never married; however, she was his companion for 25 years and mothered his second daughter, Zeena Galatea Schreck (nee LaVey), in 1963. At {{the end of their}} relationship, Hegarty sued for palimony.|$|E
25|$|Other Stewart–Mann westerns, such as Bend of the River (1952), The Naked Spur (1953), The Far Country (1954) and The Man from Laramie (1955), were {{perennial}} favorites {{among young}} audiences <b>entranced</b> <b>by</b> the American West. Frequently, the films featured Stewart as a troubled cowboy seeking redemption, while facing corrupt cattlemen, ranchers and outlaws—a {{man who knows}} violence first hand and struggles to control it. The Stewart–Mann collaborations {{laid the foundation for}} many of the westerns of the 1950s and remain popular today for their grittier, more realistic depiction of the classic movie genre. Audiences saw Stewart's screen persona evolve into a more mature, more ambiguous, and edgier presence.|$|E
25|$|Borovansky's next ballet, The Black Swan, {{also had}} an Australian theme. It {{was based on a}} {{historical}} incident in 1697 when Captain Vlaming from the Dutch East India Company was exploring Australia. He discovered and named Rottnest Island and the river on which the city of Perth now stands. There were a large number of black swans on the river which drew Captain Vlamingh's attention and his crew captured several and took them back to Java. Thus, the main plot of the ballet was the story of the Captain <b>entranced</b> <b>by</b> a black swan, which symbolised a new land. The ballet premiered in Melbourne in the Borovansky Ballet's 1949 season. The work was revived both in 1950 and 1951.|$|E

As they put up a futile effort to fight back, the crowd starts cheering for Joe and Silvia, which gives them the power to transform and ultimately defeat Jet Black. Captain Blue is restored to normal and reveals that Jet was his best friend and cinematographer, but had found the Black Film one day and became <b>entranced</b> <b>by</b> its power {{and that of the}} Rainbow Oscars. In the end, it is revealed that all Jet really wanted was to prove himself as a hero to his own son Joe.|$|E
25|$|Luciana is Giovanni's {{youngest}} daughter, out of four. At {{thirteen years}} old, {{she is a}} very spoiled child. She returns early from her convent school to find that her father has taken Erik on as an apprentice. <b>Entranced</b> <b>by</b> the young Erik's air of mystery, Luciana takes an instant liking to him, but seems unable to express her feelings for him, so she teases and torments him. Erik is attracted to her as well as she is particularly beautiful for her age. Eventually, she requests that Giovanni remove Erik's mask, and after she has seen his ugliness, she runs away, falling from a section of crumbling roof of their two story house and dying a grotesquely violent end.|$|E
25|$|Gaston {{talks to}} Gigi {{and she tells}} him {{that she is not}} the type of girl who wants {{publicity}} and to be dumped by him one day, then having to become someone else’s mistress. Gigi wants their relationship to remain platonic but when Gaston accidentally reveals that he loves Gigi she bursts into tears, upset that he would want to expose her to the uncertainty of being his mistress if he actually loves her. Gaston leaves angered, where he later runs into Honoré, who declares the family has always been a bit odd. Gigi later calls Gaston up, admitting she would rather be miserable with him than without him and agrees to accompany him in public. Gigi dresses in finery for their date, and when Gaston arrives, he is <b>entranced</b> <b>by</b> her beauty.|$|E

25|$|When Bowles {{had first}} visited Tangier with Aaron Copland in 1931, {{they were both}} outsiders to what they {{perceived}} as an exotic place of different customs. They were not bound by any local rules, which varied among the many ethnic groups. Tangier was a Moroccan and international city, a longtime trading center, with a population made up of Berber, Arab, Spanish, French and other Europeans, speaking Spanish, French, Berber and Arabic, and professing a variety of religions. Politically it was {{under the control of}} a consortium of foreign powers, including the United States. Paul Bowles was <b>entranced</b> <b>by</b> the city's culture. By his return in 1947 the city had of course changed, but he still found it full of strangeness and wonder. In 1955 anti-European riots erupted as the people sought independence. In 1956 the city was returned to full Moroccan control.|$|E
25|$|Elliott shows little {{interest}} in the kidnapping. Shortly thereafter, however, Haley Dubois (Morgan Flynn) and her father arrive in their run-down mobile home and move in next door. Haley's father is the new deputy sheriff in town, and Haley is <b>entranced</b> <b>by</b> the mystery surrounding the kidnapping of Froggy Doo. Elliott quickly begins {{to fall in love with}} Haley, and soon he agrees to help Haley and Rocky find Froggy Doo in order to win Haley's heart. The three kids have to find the marionette before the two bumbling FBI agents, Hardigan (Peter Scolari) and Brinkman (Rick Overton) can do so. Elliott, Haley, and Rocky's list of suspects include the local bully, a store clerk, and Happy Herb's wife Viv (Brenda Strong). As the kids pursue the case, Elliott and Rocky's brotherly bond strengthens, and Elliott realizes he might not only win back the love of his father but provide his family with the substantial reward money and help his parents' marriage, too.|$|E
500|$|The {{music is}} {{predominantly}} slow-moving and quiet. Bryars allocated distinct voice types {{to the different}} types of roles: town elders, young lovers and scientists. He also included some unusual instruments in his orchestra: an oboe d'amore and an amplified jazz bass in the love scene, an electronic keyboard and a flugelhorn instead of trumpets in the brass section. The [...] reception was mixed with several critics complaining of boredom while others wrote of members of the audience being <b>entranced</b> <b>by</b> the music.|$|E

His strength and good looks have aroused [...] "the cunning spirits", {{and on his}} way to a feast one summer evening, he is <b>entranced</b> <b>by</b> the [...] "singing" [...] woods. The opening music, [...] "breezy" [...] and triumphant in C major, recalls the Karelia Overture, Op. 10 (not to be confused with the Karelia Suite, Op. 11) which Sibelius had written in 1893, and betrays no sign of Björn's impending fate. Björn's theme is recapitulated at the end of the second section.|$|E
500|$|By all accounts, James was {{at first}} <b>entranced</b> <b>by</b> his bride, but his infatuation {{evaporated}} quickly and the couple often found themselves at loggerheads, though {{in the early years}} of their marriage, James seems always to have treated Anne with patience and affection. Between 1593 and 1595, James was romantically linked with Anne Murray, later Lady Glamis, whom he addressed in verse as [...] "my mistress and my love"; and Anne herself was also occasionally the subject of scandalous rumours. In Basilikon Doron, written 1597–1598, James described marriage as [...] "the greatest earthly felicitie or miserie, that can come to a man".|$|E
500|$|Vašek expresses his confusions in a short, sad song ("I can't {{get it out}} of my head"), but is {{interrupted}} by the arrival of a travelling circus.

500|$|According {{to local}} folklore, the Doom Bar {{was created by}} the Mermaid of Padstow as a dying curse after being shot. In 1906, Enys Tregarthen wrote that a Padstow local, Tristram Bird, bought a new gun and wanted to shoot {{something}} worthy of it. He went hunting seals at Hawker's Cove but found a young woman sitting on a rock brushing her hair. <b>Entranced</b> <b>by</b> her beauty, he offered to marry her and when she refused he shot her in retaliation, only realising afterwards that she was a mermaid. As she died she cursed the harbour with a [...] "bar of doom", from Hawker's Cove to Trebetherick Bay. A terrible gale blew up that night and when it finally subsided there was the sandbar, [...] "covered with wrecks of ships and bodies of drowned men".|$|E
500|$|Most critics' praise went to Robin Williams' {{performance}} as Genie, with Janet Maslin of The New York Times declaring that children [...] "needn't know precisely what Mr. Williams is evoking {{to understand how}} funny he is."

[...] Furthermore, English-Irish comedian Spike Milligan considered {{it to be the}} greatest film of all time. James Berardinelli gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising the [...] "crisp visuals and wonderful song-and-dance numbers." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said the comedy made the film accessible to both children and adults, a vision shared with Desson Howe of The Washington Post, who also said [...] "kids are still going to be <b>entranced</b> <b>by</b> the magic and adventure." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety praised the cast of characters, describing the expressive magic carpet as [...] "its most remarkable accomplishment" [...] and considered that [...] "Aladdin overcomes most story flaws thanks to sheer technical virtuosity." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Chris Carabott {{rated the}} premiere 9/10, calling the [...] "peek {{into the life}} of The Others... {{exceptionally}} done" [...] and the non-appearance of the other survivors [...] "a smart move". Carabott also praised Jack's flashbacks, writing [...] "Previously, Jack has been written as the white knight and reluctant hero who everyone looked to in their time of need. The more chinks they show in Jack's armor, the better - the more human he becomes." [...] He called [...] "Juliet... a promising new character who will hopefully add a new dimension to The Others this season" [...] and concluded his review by calling the episode [...] "a solid season opener". Robert Bianco from USA Today praised the opening scene and called the episode [...] "a fine start for a great series" [...] but with reservations. Bianco wished Jack would [...] "win one again for the team", and was fearful that Lost could eventually become like Alias, [...] "a series that became so <b>entranced</b> <b>by</b> its puzzle and its villains that it let the main characters vanish behind them".|$|E
