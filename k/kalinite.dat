40|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} concerning the surface mineralogy {{and the history of}} water on Mars remain unresolved using the Viking analyses and Earth-based telescopic data. Identification and quantitation of iron-bearing clays on Mars would elucidate these outstanding issues. Near infrared correlation analysis, a method typically applied to qualitative and quantitative analysis of individual constituents of multicomponent mixtures, is adapted here to selection of distinctive features of a small, highly homologous series of Fe/Ca-exchanged montmorillonites and several <b>kalinites.</b> Independently determined measures of surface iron, relative humidity and stored electronic energy were used as constituent data for linear regression of the constituent vs. reflectance data throughout the spectral region 0. 68 to 2. 5 micrometers. High correlations were found in appropriate regions for all three constituents, though that with stored energy is still considered tenuous. Quantitation was improved using 1 st and 2 nd derivative spectra. High resolution data over a broad spectral range would be required to quantitatively identify iron-bearing clays by remotely sensed reflectance...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Kalinite</b> {{is a rare}} {{secondary}} mineral observed in the oxidized zone of mineral deposits, as efflorescence on alum slates, in caves, and as a volcanic sublimate. [...] It is associated with jarosite, KFe3+3(SO4)2(OH)6, and cuprian melanterite (pisanite), (Fe2+,Cu2+)SO4·7H2O, at Quetena, Chile.|$|E
50|$|It {{forms as}} an {{alteration}} product of pyrite in aluminium rich rocks and in coal seams.It also occurs in pyrite rich hydrothermal ore deposits in arid regions. It forms in fumaroles and in caves. It occurs with <b>kalinite,</b> alunogen, epsomite, melanterite, copiapite and gypsum.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Kalinite</b> is {{a mineral}} {{composed}} of hydrated potassium aluminium sulfate (a type of alum). It is a fibrous monoclinic alum, distinct from isometric potassium alum, named in 1868.

50|$|Potassium alum or alum-(K) is a {{naturally}} occurring sulfate mineral, which typically occurs as encrustations on rocks {{in areas of}} weathering and oxidation of sulfide minerals and potassium-bearing minerals. In the past, alum was obtained from alunite, a mineral mined from sulfur-containing volcanic sediments source. Alunite is an associate and likely potassium and aluminium source. It has been reported at Vesuvius, Italy; east of Springsure, Queensland; Alum Cave, Tennessee; Alum Gulch, Santa Cruz County, Arizona and the Philippine island of Cebu. A related mineral is <b>kalinite,</b> a fibrous mineral with formula KAl(SO4)2·11H2O.|$|E
