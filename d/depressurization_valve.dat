50|$|There {{are several}} large <b>depressurization</b> <b>valves</b> {{located near the}} top of the reactor {{pressure}} vessel. These constitute the DPVS. This is a capability supplemental to the ADS, which is also included on the (E)SBWR. The DPVS consists of eight of these valves, four on main steamlines that vent to the drywell when actuated and four venting directly into the wetwell.|$|R
40|$|Two tests {{related to}} a new safety system for a {{pressurized}} water reactor were performed with the ROSA/LSTF (rig of safety assessment/large scale test facility). The tests simulated cold leg small-break loss-of-coolant accidents with 2 -inch diameter break using an early steam generator (SG) secondary-side depressurization with or without release of nitrogen gas dissolved in accumulator (ACC) water. The SG depressurization was initiated by fully opening the <b>depressurization</b> <b>valves</b> in both SGs immediately after a safety injection signal. The pressure difference between the primary and SG secondary sides after the actuation of ACC system was larger in the test with the dissolved gas release than that in the test without the dissolved gas release. No core uncovery and heatup took place because of the ACC coolant injection and two-phase natural circulation. Long-term core cooling was ensured by the actuation of low-pressure injection system. The RELAP 5 code predicted most of the overall trends of the major thermal-hydraulic responses after adjusting a break discharge coefficient for two-phase discharge flow under the assumption of releasing all the dissolved gas at the vessel upper plenum...|$|R
40|$|Counter Current Flow Limitation (CCFL) was {{observed}} in the pressurizer surge line of the Oregon State University APEX facility during test NRC- 10. This test simulated a one-inch diameter cold leg break with a failure of three of four of the fourth-stage Automatic <b>Depressurization</b> System (ADS) <b>valves.</b> The result was a high vapor flow rate through ADS 1 - 3, that caused CCFL in the pressurizer surge line and liquid holdup in the pressurizer. Because this liquid was not available for core cooling, further study of the passive safety systems in the AP 600 under Mode 5 Cold Shutdown conditions was deemed necessary. An analysis of the AP 600 geometry and the existing CCFL database determined that Kutateladze scaling is appropriate for the APEX and AP 600 surge lines. The Kutateladze CCFL correlation {{was used to assess}} CCFL in the APEX and AP 600 pressurizer surge lines under Mode 5 Cold Shutdown conditions. The results indicate that CCFL would be expected in the pressurizer surge lines at low pressures and decay powers prior to ADS 4 actuation. Test NRC- 35 examined CCFL and provided data to benchmark NRC's thermal hydraulic analysis codes. This thesis presents the results of test NRC- 35 and the supporting CCFL calculations...|$|R
