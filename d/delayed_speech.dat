40|$|Background: <b>Speech</b> <b>delay</b> {{is one of}} the {{problems}} of child development. The most common cause of <b>speech</b> <b>delay</b> is sensorineural hearing loss. Risk factors that may affect sensorineural hearing loss varies, ranging from risk factor on prenatal to after birth. Objective: To determine the risk factors that affect the sensorineural hearing loss in patients with <b>speech</b> <b>delay.</b> Methods: This is an analytic observational study using case control design. The subjects were 62 patients with <b>speech</b> <b>delay,</b> consisting of 31 patients with <b>speech</b> <b>delay</b> diagnosed with SNHL as a case group and 31 patients with <b>speech</b> <b>delay</b> undiagnosed with SNHL as a control group. The statistical analysis inferential test was performed using chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. Statistical multivariate analyzes test was performed using logistic regression test. Results: Low birth weight is a risk factor affecting SNHL in patients with <b>speech</b> <b>delay</b> (OR = 27. 259 CI = 1. 749 to 440. 491; p = 0. 018). Prenatal history, prematurity, neonatal asphyxia, neonatal jaundice, and postnatal history has no effect on SNHL in patients with <b>speech</b> <b>delay.</b> Conclusions: Low birth weight is a risk factor affecting SNHL in patients with <b>speech</b> <b>delay.</b> Keywords: sensorineural hearing loss, <b>speech</b> <b>delay,</b> risk factor...|$|R

5000|$|Intellectual Disability is the {{limitation}} in an individual's mental functioning and skills. Patients of Wilson-Turner Syndrome have mental disability generally ranging from mild to severe, more frequently on the former.

However, individuals who displayed aggression and became easily upset were also seen. Children will display a <b>delay</b> in <b>speech</b> development often combined with excessive drooling and low voice tone. Some of the studied male patients had speech impairment ranging from little or no speech to minor stuttering.|$|R

[...] Commonalities include usually being boys, <b>delayed</b> <b>speech</b> development, highly educated parents, musically gifted families, puzzle-solving abilities, and lagging social development. [...] Late talkers can often be misdiagnosed as having autism. Many high achieving late talkers were notoriously strong willed and noncompliant as children.

5000|$|Other {{changes in}} the number or {{structure}} of chromosome 7 can cause delayed growth and development, mental disorder, characteristic facial features, skeletal abnormalities, <b>delayed</b> <b>speech,</b> and other medical problems. These changes include an extra copy of part of chromosome 7 in each cell (partial trisomy 7) or a missing segment of the chromosome in each cell (partial monosomy 7). In some cases, several DNA building blocks (nucleotides) are deleted or duplicated in part of chromosome 7. A circular structure called ring chromosome 7 is also possible. A ring chromosome occurs when both ends of a broken chromosome are reunited.|$|E
50|$|Schizencephaly can be {{distinguished}} from porencephaly {{by the fact that}} in schizencephaly the fluid-filled component, if present, is entirely lined by heterotopic grey matter while a porencephalic cyst is lined mostly by white matter.

40|$|Background: Subtelomeric deletions of {{the long}} arm of {{chromosome}} 20 are rare, with only 11 described in the literature.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We characterized microdeletions at 20 q 13. 33 in six individuals referred for genetic evaluation of developmental delay, mental retardation, and/or congenital anomalies.

5000|$|The {{first case}} of PMS was {{described}} in 1985 by Watt et al., who described a 14-year-old boy with severe intellectual disability, mild dysmorphic features and absent speech, which was associated with terminal loss of the distal arm of chromosome 22. [...] In 1988, Phelan et al. described a similar clinical presentation associated with a de novo deletion in 22q13.3. Subsequent cases where described in the following years with a similar clinical presentation. Phelan et al. (2001), compared 37 subjects with 22q13 deletions with features of 24 cases described in the literature finding that the most common features were global developmental delay, absent or <b>delayed</b> <b>speech</b> and hypotonia. In 2001, Bonaglia et al., described a case that associated the 22q.13 deletion syndrome with a disruption of the SHANK3 gene (also called ProSAP2). The following year, Anderlid et al. (2002), refined the area in 22q13 presumably responsible for the common phenotypic presentation of the syndrome to a 100kb in 22q13.3. Out of the three genes affected, SHANK3 was identified as the critical gene due to its expression pattern and function. Wilson et al. (2003) evaluated 56 patients with the clinical presentation of PMS, {{all of whom had}} a functional loss of one copy of the SHANK3 gene. However, later the same group demonstrated that loss of SHANK3 gene was not an essential requirement for the disorder.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{whether there is an}} association between prenatal ultrasound exposure and <b>delayed</b> <b>speech</b> in children. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Network of community physicians affiliated with the Primary Care Research Unit, University of Calgary. SUBJECTS: Thirty-four practitioners identified 72 children aged 24 to 100 months who had undergone a formal speech-language evaluation and were found to have <b>delayed</b> <b>speech</b> of unknown cause by a speech-language pathologist. For each case subject the practitioners found two control subjects matched for sex, date of birth, sibling birth order and associated health problems. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of prenatal ultrasound exposure and <b>delayed</b> <b>speech.</b> RESULTS: The children with <b>delayed</b> <b>speech</b> had a higher rate of ultrasound exposure than the control subjects. The findings suggest that a child with <b>delayed</b> <b>speech</b> is about twice as likely as a child without <b>delayed</b> <b>speech</b> to have been exposed to prenatal ultrasound waves (odds ratio 2. 8, 95 % confidence limit 1. 5 to 5. 3; p = 0. 001).
