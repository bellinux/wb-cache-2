2500|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is used in}} brewing beer, when it is {{sometimes}} called a top-fermenting or top-cropping yeast. It is so called because during the fermentation process its hydrophobic surface causes the flocs to adhere to CO2 and {{rise to the top}} of the fermentation vessel. Top-fermenting yeasts are fermented at higher temperatures than the lager yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus, and the resulting beers have a different flavor than the same beverage fermented with a lager yeast.

2500|$|During fermentation, {{there are}} several factors that winemakers take into consideration, with the most {{influential}} to ethanol production being sugar content in the must, the yeast strain used, and the <b>fermentation</b> <b>temperature.</b> The biochemical process of fermentation itself creates a lot of residual heat which can take the [...] must out of the ideal temperature range for the wine. Typically, white wine is fermented between 18-20°C (64-68°F) [...] though a wine maker may choose to use a higher temperature to bring {{out some of the}} complexity of the wine. Red wine is typically fermented at higher temperatures up to 29°C (85°F).

2500|$|One of {{the major}} {{differences}} between Old world and New world styles of Chenin blanc is the <b>fermentation</b> <b>temperature.</b> Old World style producers in the Loire tend to ferment their Chenin blanc at higher temperatures, 60-68°F (16-20°C), than New World producers in South Africa and elsewhere, usually fermenting their whites at temperatures around 50-54°F (10-12°C). This is because Old World wine producers tend not to put a premium on the tropical fruit flavors and aromas that come out more vividly with cooler fermentation temperatures. Chenin blanc can accommodate some skin contact and maceration which will allow extraction of phenolic compounds that could add {{to the complexity of}} the wine. Two of the aromas that skin contact can bring out is the characteristic greengage and angelica notes of Chenin. The grape's characteristic acidity can be softened by malolactic fermentation, which will give the wine a creamier or [...] "fattier" [...] texture as would a period spent aging on the lees. The use of wood or oak aging is up to each individual producer. Old World producers tend to shy away from the use of new oak barrels which can impart flavors of vanilla, spice, and toastiness; though these notes may be desirable for a New World producer. In Savennières there is a tradition of using acacia and chestnut barrels for aging; though acacia can impart a yellow tint to the wine, and chestnut barrels may add some buttery notes.|$|E

50|$|Final {{flavors of}} beer are {{influenced}} by the strain of yeast and the <b>fermentation</b> <b>temperature.</b> Lager yeast is best used at temperatures from 48 to 58 F.

50|$|Other {{techniques}} {{associated with}} Old World winemakers include higher <b>fermentation</b> <b>temperatures</b> and {{a period of}} extended maceration following fermentation where the wine can leech more phenolic compounds from the grape skins.

The winemaking process was followed during 4 weeks, being registered the amounts of grapes received, the <b>fermentation</b> <b>temperatures,</b> the time at which fermentation was stopped and evolution of must densities until the fortification time. The characterization of musts and wines was done in terms of density, total and volatile acidity, alcohol content, pH, total of polyphenol, organic acids composition, sugars concentration and the volatile profile. Also, it was developed and validated an analytical methodology to quantify the volatile fatty acids, namely using SPME-GC-MS. Briefly, the following key features were obtained for the latter methodology: linearity (R 2 = 0. 999) e high sensitivity (LOD = 0. 026 - 0. 068 mg/L), suitable precision (repeatability and reproducibility lower than 8, 5 %) and good recoveries (103, 11 - 119, 46 %).

50|$|Fermentation by lactobacilli is {{introduced}} naturally, as these air-borne bacteria culture on raw cabbage leaves where they grow. Yeasts also are present, and may yield soft sauerkraut of poor flavor when the <b>fermentation</b> <b>temperature</b> is too high. The fermentation process has three phases, collectively {{sometimes referred to}} as population dynamics. In the first phase, anaerobic bacteria such as Klebsiella and Enterobacter lead the fermentation, and begin producing an acidic environment that favors later bacteria. The second phase starts as the acid levels become too high for many bacteria, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides and other Leuconostoc spp. take dominance. In the third phase, various Lactobacillus species, including L. brevis and L. plantarum, ferment any remaining sugars, further lowering the pH. Properly cured sauerkraut is sufficiently acidic to prevent a favorable environment for the growth of Clostridium botulinum, the toxins of which cause botulism.|$|E
50|$|In {{still wine}} production, {{particularly}} of red wines and some white wines like Chardonnay, the secondary fermentation process can also usher {{in the use}} of malolactic fermentation (or MLF) where the hard, green apple-like malic acid is converted into softer, butter-like lactic acid.
