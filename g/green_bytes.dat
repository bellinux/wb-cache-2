40|$|This {{document}} covers {{image processing}} functions available in Eyebot RoBIOS version 2. 3 internal patch level g. It tries {{to give the}} reader a good start to use the available primitives as eective as possible. It {{is based on the}} RoBIOS source code, to make sure the function descriptions are as accurate as possible. 1 Introduction Eyebot image functions handle 4 -bit gray scale images and 24 bit color images. There are two dened image types, available when including "eyebot. h": #define imagecolumns 82 #define imagerows 62 BYTE image[imagerows][imagecolumns]; /* 5084 bytes */ BYTE colimage[imagerows][imagecolumns][3]; /* 15252 bytes */ The image dimensions are 80 rows and 60 columns with one border row on all sides. The color images are RGB images with red as <b>byte</b> 0, <b>green</b> as <b>byte</b> 1 and blue as byte 2. The memory layout of the image types makes this the fastest way to loop thru the image components: image img; int row, column; for (row = 1; row < imagerows- 1; row++) for (c [...] ...|$|R
