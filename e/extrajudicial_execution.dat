25|$|Altogether, about 767 Jews from Norway were {{deported}} {{and sent}} to concentration camps under German control, primarily Auschwitz. 26 of these survived the ordeal. In addition to the 741 murdered in the camps, 23 {{died as a result}} of <b>extrajudicial</b> <b>execution,</b> murder, and suicide during the war; bringing the total of Jewish Norwegian dead to at least 764, comprising 230 complete households.|$|E
25|$|Indonesian {{military}} abuses {{against women}} in East Timor were numerous and well-documented.

The {{scope of the problem}} is difficult to ascertain, owing to the intense military control imposed during the occupation, compounded by the shame felt by victims.|$|E

25|$|Immense {{power in}} the {{executive}} branch and corruption in the legislative and judiciary branches also contribute to the worsening of Mexico's human rights situation, leading to such problems as police forces violating basic human rights through torture and threats, the autonomy of the military and its consequences and the ineffectiveness of the judiciary in upholding and preserving basic human rights. Some of the forms of human rights violations in recent years presented by human rights organizations include illegal arrests, secret and prolonged detention, torture, rape, <b>extrajudicial</b> <b>execution,</b> and fabrication of evidence.|$|E
500|$|The Misrata militia took Gaddafi prisoner, causing serious {{injuries}} {{as they tried}} to apprehend him; the events were filmed on a mobile phone. A video appears to picture Gaddafi being poked or stabbed in the anus [...] "with some kind of stick or knife" [...] or possibly a bayonet. Pulled onto the front of a pick-up truck, he fell off as it drove away. His semi-naked, lifeless body was then placed into an ambulance and taken to Misrata; upon arrival, he was found to be dead. Official NTC accounts claimed that Gaddafi was caught in a cross-fire and died from his bullet wounds. Other eye-witness accounts claimed that rebels had fatally shot Gaddafi in the stomach. Gaddafi's son Mutassim, who had also been among the convoy, was also captured, and found dead several hours later, most probably from an <b>extrajudicial</b> <b>execution.</b> Around 140 Gaddafi loyalists were rounded up from the convoy; tied up and abused, the corpses of 66 were found at the nearby Mahari Hotel, victims of <b>extrajudicial</b> <b>execution.</b> Libya's chief forensic pathologist, Othman al-Zintani, carried out the autopsies of Gaddafi, his son and Jabr in the days following their deaths; although the pathologist initially told the press that Gaddafi had died from a gunshot wound to the head, the autopsy report was not made public.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to suffering systematic sexual slavery, forced sterilization, enforced marriage, torture, and <b>extrajudicial</b> <b>execution,</b> women also faced rape {{and sexual abuse}} during interrogation by Indonesian authorities. These women included the wives of resistance members, resistance activists and suspected Fretilin collaborators. Often times women were targeted and subjected to torture {{as a form of}} proxy violence when male relatives who were suspected of being Fretilin were not present. [...] In 1999 researcher Rebecca Winters released the book Buibere: Voice of East Timorese Women, which chronicles many personal stories of violence and abuse dating to the earliest days of the occupation. One woman tells of being interrogated while stripped half-naked, tortured, molested, and threatened with death. Another describes being chained at the hands and feet, raped repeatedly, and interrogated for weeks. A woman who had prepared food for Fretilin guerrillas was arrested, burned with cigarettes, tortured with electricity, and forced to walk naked past a row of soldiers into a tank filled with urine and feces.|$|E

2500|$|In 1941–1942 {{during the}} {{occupation}} of Norway by Nazi Germany, {{there were at least}} 2,173 Jews in Norway. At least 775 of them were arrested, detained and/or deported. More than half of the Norwegians who died in camps in Germany were Jews. 742 Jews were murdered in the camps and 23 Jews {{died as a result of}} <b>extrajudicial</b> <b>execution,</b> murder and suicide during the war, bringing the total of Jewish Norwegian dead to at least 765 Jews, comprising 230 complete households. [...] "Nearly two-thirds of the Jews in Norway fled from Norway". Of these, around 900 Jews were smuggled out of the country by the Norwegian resistance movement, mostly to Sweden but some also to the United Kingdom). Between 28 and 34 of those deported survived their continued imprisonment in camps (following their deportation)—and around 25 (of these) returned to Norway after the war.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} expose the relationships between State and Violence {{in the cases of}} <b>extrajudicial</b> <b>executions</b> that occurred massively during Álvaro Uribe’s Presidential tenure, showing how Democratic Security policy represents the framework of such legitimization. In this sense, it puts at stake the classical definitions of the State concerning the monopoly of the use of force by posing the following question {{at the center of the}} debate: Is it just the legal force what the State controls? For so doing, it will develop a case study of <b>extrajudicial</b> <b>executions</b> occurred in Eastern Antioquia region and then it will analyze the discourses given by different state agents in front of the cases, for showing the patterns for the creation of a combat scenario for the illegal killings and the official responses as denial discourses regarding the cases nationwide. Data have been collected from newspapers, magazines, reports from State agencies, NGOs and from Nations Special Rapporteur on <b>extrajudicial</b> <b>executions.</b> Both the above patterns as State responses show how legality is constructed and legitimized in violent ways in regarding <b>extrajudicial</b> <b>executions</b> cases in Colombia: by silencing the context, dealing with bodies and how they are got and counted, denying the facts, and denying the victims.
