The Income Tax Law of 1928 introducing income tax was the first law drafted entirely in English. Income tax has been levied at a flat rate of 20% set by the occupying Germans during the Second World War.|$|E

This was challenged by an individual who argued the constitution forbade the states from collecting taxation in this way.

Since NSW expends far more than it can ever earn, it has little choice but to comply with Commonwealth demands.|$|R

Heavy taxation of status goods, despite the fact that these are typically overconsumed, is not particularly favoured in a social welfare maximisation context, because the tax rate is highly distortionary, due to the presence of piracy. It is also noted that corrective taxation, aimed at remedying the inefficiencies associated with the consumption externalities generated by the status goods, is made ineffective by piracy...|$|R
25|$|The King and noblemen, {{as well as}} high officials, had {{the right}} to receive {{conveyance}} from farmers.

Conveyance duty (Norwegian: skyssplikt) is known since the 12th century and functioned as <b>indirect</b> <b>taxation.</b> In 1816, the duty was changed from being a free service to receiving payment per trip. However, the partial tax freedom which conveyance farmers had was abolished at the same time.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of our research}} is to make extensive analysis on the budgets of EU member states in order to emphasize the main trends within the period 2000 - 2011.

On our case study we are focusing only in indirect taxes since these are, for many EU countries the main budgetary revenues. Another important reason for focusing on <b>indirect</b> <b>taxations</b> is the fact that most countries during the financial crises consider readjusting of these taxes on of the main tool to adapt to the lack of public resources. Our research is based on data extracted from EUROSTAT and our calculation and compilations. Our working hypothesis is that despite huge differences in tax policy among all 27 European countries there are some common trends and Romanian tax policy must adapt and must follow them. Another important element is that trends in fiscal policy may vary due different elements such as: level of development, social policy issues, systems of financing different public expenditures, number and structure of populations, regional and local objectives and many others. The VAT, the main important indirect tax is extensively annualized since most of the trends of taxation are dictated by the trends of VAT. Romania is a special example, not the only one., where VAT has significance importance for budgetary revenues and was the main element of fiscal adjustments during the financial crisis...|$|R

The rule of law remains strongly buttressed and enforced by an independent and efficient judicial system.

The 2017 Ease of Doing Business Index by the World Bank Group places the country 12th in the world, surpassing neighbouring Finland, Australia, Germany, Canada and Switzerland. The strong focus on the IT sector has led to much faster, simpler and efficient public services where for example filing a tax return takes less than five minutes and 98% of banking transactions are conducted through the internet.

25|$|Muldoon {{initially}} opposed indirect consumer taxation on {{the basis}} that it would penalise poor people and increase inflation due to compensatory wage increases. However, in May 1979 he attempted to increase tax revenue by levying 10–20% taxes {{on a wide range of}} goods, including petrol, lawnmowers, caravans and boats. The taxes were criticised for being discriminatory, ineffective and a quick means of raising more revenue for the government without any accompanying fundamental reform of the taxation system – there were no income tax cuts to reflect the shift to <b>indirect</b> <b>taxation.</b> The immediate result of the boat and caravan levy, in particular, was the decimation of both industries as potential buyers could not afford to pay the 20% tax on top of the construction costs; the tax also had the additional effect of adding to the numbers of unemployed as boat and caravan builders could not pay their employees because of the order cancellations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{issues of}} tax {{harmonization}} and fiscal integration in Europe {{have been discussed}} since the Treaty of Rome, they have become a very live and contentious issue. By reviewing briefly the literature, the paper argues that closer cooperation in tax issues, for both <b>indirect</b> and direct <b>taxation,</b> needs to accompany {{the current state of}} integration in the European Union. Tax competition could undermine economic integration in Europe, while fiscal integration could enhance economic efficiency and economic integration within the common market. Since the foundation of the European Economic Community in 1957, there is a perpetual debate going on over the necessity of an overall tax and fiscal cooperation and harmonization in Europe, which has been intensified mainly because of Economic and Monetary Union...|$|R
25|$|Heath {{also tried}} to curb the trade unions with the Industrial Relations Act 1971, and hoped to deregulate the economy and make a {{transfer}} from direct to <b>indirect</b> <b>taxation.</b> Rising unemployment in 1972 led him to reflate the economy; he attempted to control the resulting high inflation by a prices and incomes policy. Two miners' strikes, in 1972 and {{at the start of}} 1974, damaged the government; the latter caused the implementation of the Three-Day Week to conserve energy. Heath eventually called an election for February 1974 to obtain a mandate to face down the miners' wage demands, but this instead resulted in a hung parliament in which the Labour Party, despite gaining fewer votes, had four more seats than the Conservatives. Heath resigned as Prime Minister after trying in vain to form a coalition with the Liberal Party. Despite losing a second general election in October that year, he vowed to continue as leader of his party. In February 1975, Margaret Thatcher challenged and defeated him to win the leadership.|$|E

Webb, who chaired the board of trustees appointed to supervise the legacy, proposed to use most of it to found a school of economics and politics.

The more people that paid income tax, Gladstone believed, the more the public would pressure the government into abolishing it.

40|$|The paper studies {{non-linear}} {{income taxation}} and linear commodity taxation {{in a household}} production context with households differentiated by market and non-market ability. In such a setting, there is an efficiency motive for re-distribution which is independent from the usual equity motive, and operates also when the social planner is indifferent to utility inequality. As a consequence, some of the policy prescriptions applicable to the case in which households differ in market ability only do not hold when households differ also in non-market ability. For instance, re-distribution is not necessarily from high- to low-wage households, {{and it is not}} necessarily true that the marginal rate of income tax should be zero for high incomes and positive for low incomes. In some cases, re-distribution may accentuate rather than lessen utility inequality, and can reverse the direction of income inequality relative to the laissez-faire equilibrium. Furthermore, contrary to Atkinson-Stiglitz, it may be optimal to use <b>indirect</b> and direct <b>taxation</b> simultaneously even when the utility function is separable in commodities and labour.

Wantje Fritschy – Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam – June 2007 The ‘world of islam’ and ‘the West’ before 1800 {{seem to have}} displayed different ‘fiscal values’: {{not only was it}} forbidden to take or offer interest according to the Quran, but also indirect urban taxes were illegal according to the shari‘a. Can these differences have been important to explain their divergent historical development? Or was Sevket Pamuk (2004) right in supposing that during the seventeenth and eighteenth century the parallels between the evolution of Ottoman public finance and that of its European counterparts became in fact quite striking? This paper seeks to answer these questions on behalf of existing literature and by focusing on the Middle East and North Africa. It emphasizes the absence of urban public finance and the lack of urban autonomy {{in this part of the}} world. It moreover highlights the importance of <b>indirect</b> urban <b>taxation</b> in Western Europe for a ‘financial revolution’ that enabled states to contract perpetual loans at low rates of interest and that made public debts into an important element of their fiscal systems. It concludes that an understanding of the pre-Islamic historical roots of institutional differences between cities in both worlds may be at least as important as a focus on differences in ‘fiscal values’. From a comparison in more detail of the relations between tax farming and public debt in France with the seemingly related malikane- and esham-systems of public finance in the Ottoman Empire, it concludes that both fiscal systems remained in fact strikingly different. The paper, lastly, suggests that differences in population development and population density, due to ecological differences in both parts of the world, may have been as important as ‘fiscal values’ to explain this continuing difference...|$|R
40|$|The complex {{causes of}} the current food and {{agriculture}} crisis require a comprehensive response. In view of the urgency of assisting people and countries in need, {{the first set of}} policy actions— an emergency package—consists of steps that can yield immediate impact: 1. expand emergency responses and humanitarian assistance to food-insecure people and people threatening government legitimacy, 2. eliminate agricultural export bans and export restrictions, 3. undertake fast-impact food production programs in key areas, and 4. change biofuel policies. A second set of actions—a resilience package—consists of the following steps: 5. calm markets with the use of market-oriented regulation of speculation, shared public grain stocks, strengthened food-import financing, and reliable food aid; 6. invest in social protection; 7. scale up investments for sustained agricultural growth; and 8. complete the Doha Round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations. Investment in these actions calls for additional resources. Policymakers should consider mobilizing resources from four sources: the winners from the commodity boom among countries; the community of traditional and new donor countries; direct or <b>indirect</b> progressive <b>taxation</b> and reallocation of public expenditures in the affected countries themselves; and mobilization of private sector finance, including through improved outreach of banking to agriculture. Because of countries' diverse situations, the design of programs must be country driven and country owned. Accountability for sound implementation must also rest with countries.
