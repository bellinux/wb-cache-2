5|$|On January 6, 2012, Mancera {{resigned}} {{as attorney general}} to become candidate for the Head of Government in the July 1, 2012 election. Jesús Rodríguez Almeida took his place as Attorney General. On January 8, Mancera registered as a precandidate for Mayor of Mexico City, {{as a member of}} the PRD. On January 19, he became the official Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) candidate for Mayor of Mexico City, running against Alejandra Barrales, Gerardo Fernández Noroña, Martí Batres and Joel Ortega Cuevas, representing the leftist Progressive Movement coalition, which is formed by the PRD party, the Labor Party, and the Citizen's Movement Party.

5000|$|With 1994 {{being the}} final year of his administration's sexenio (the country's six-year {{executive}} term limit), then-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari endorsed Luis Donaldo Colosio as the <b>Institutional</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Party's</b> (PRI) presidential candidate for the Mexico's 1994 general election. In accordance with party tradition during election years, Salinas de Gortari began an unrecorded spending spree. Mexico's current account deficit grew to roughly 7% of GDP that same year, and Salinas de Gortari allowed the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit, Mexico's treasury, to issue short-term peso-denominated treasury bills with a guaranteed repayment denominated in U.S. dollars, called [...] "tesobonos". These bills offered a lower yield than Mexico's traditional peso-denominated treasury bills, called [...] "cetes", but their dollar-denominated returns were more attractive to foreign investors.|$|R

5000|$|In 1988, Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, son of {{president}} Lázaro Cárdenas, broke with the PRI, forming an independent leftist party, the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD. It {{is not by}} chance that the party used the word [...] "Revolution" [...] in its name, challenging the <b>Institutional</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Party's</b> appropriation of the Mexican Revolution. Earlier, there was a leftist party the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, which never functioned as a full political party fielding presidential candidates, but asserted its legitimacy {{as the party of}} Revolution in Mexico until its demise.In this the Mexican Revolution was not revolutionary, only making the mechanisms of power less autocratic and more efficient in the attainment of its interests. Octavio Paz wrote that the revolution strengthened the Mexican state more than ever, making Mexico a very state-centered and patrimonialist society. In such a development they betrayed their acknowledged liberal predecessors of the Restored Republic of 1867-1876 which saw the most significant break from authoritarian politics in Mexico's history.|$|R
25|$|While {{many factors}} {{have contributed to}} the {{escalating}} violence, security analysts in Mexico City trace the origins of the rising scourge to the unraveling of a longtime implicit arrangement between narcotics traffickers and governments controlled by the <b>Institutional</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Party</b> (PRI), which began to lose its grip on political power in the late 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Competition was intense, {{with the}} National Action Party (PAN) eager {{to hold on}} to the {{presidency}} for a second period, the <b>Institutional</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Party</b> (PRI) equally keen to regain the office it lost in the 2000 election for the first time in 71 years (then in coalition with the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico), and the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) (then in coalition with Convergence and the Labor Party) believing itself to have a good chance to win after disappointments in the two previous elections.|$|E
25|$|LGBT {{participation}} {{is a part}} of the long-governing <b>Institutional</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Party</b> (PRI). Since the triumph of the Liberals under President Benito Juárez in the 1860s and the 1910 Revolution, there has been separation of church and state in Mexico. With morality generally considered the province of the Church, the PRI (which considers itself the party of the Revolution) has generally been reluctant to be seen as implementing the will of the Catholic Church. However, it has also been careful not to offend Catholic moral sensibilities.|$|E

25|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, Mexico was {{dominated}} by the <b>Institutional</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Party</b> (PRI). Discontent with this one-party system became prominent in the northern states of Mexico, including Sonora. As early as 1967, a competing party, the National Action Party (PAN), won control of the city government of Sonora's capital, Hermosillo. PAN won important municipal victories {{in the state in}} 1983, which President de la Madrid refused to officially recognize but was forced to let stand. PAN's growing strength by the 1980s forced the PRI to nominate candidates who were similar to PAN, successful business executives who favored economic liberalization over traditional Mexican statism, preferred in the north of the country. <b>Institutional</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Party</b> won the Sonoran gubernatorial race in 1985, but it was heavily contested with obvious problems of fraud. By the 1990s, PRI operatives caught manipulating election results were actually prosecuted by the Sonoran state attorney. This along with other events in the country eventually led {{to the end of the}} one-party system when Vicente Fox was elected president in 2000. PAN has since dominated most of the north of the country, but Sonora did not have its first PAN governor until 2009, with the election of Guillermo Padrés Elías.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Grupo Garza Ponce {{had a strong}} {{business}} relationship with the <b>Institutional</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Party</b> (PRI) based in Nuevo León, which granted them opportunities to participate in several construction projects, including the Puente de la Unidad bridge {{and the expansion of}} the Monterrey Metro. In the 2010s, they constructed industrial park projects in Nuevo León, the Mexico City Arena, and the football stadium Estadio BBVA Bancomer, home of Mexican top division team C.F. Monterrey.

Calles is most noted for a fierce backlash against Catholics, {{which led to the}} Cristero War, a civil war between Catholic rebels and government forces, and for founding the Partido Nacional Revolucionario (National Revolutionary Party, or PNR), which became the Partido de la Revolución Mexicana (Party of the Mexican Revolution, or PRM), which eventually became the <b>Institutional</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Party</b> (PRI), that governed Mexico from 1929 to 2000 under these three different names.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the strong}} (and usually coercive) ties between the Mexican labor {{movement}} and the officialist <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Institutional</b> <b>Party</b> {{during most of the}} 20th century, Chumacero was elected once to the Congress of Puebla, six times to the Chamber of Deputies and twice to the Mexican senate; for a total of 33 years serving as legislator.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s, the Church in Chihuahua {{began to}} take an activist stance on {{creating}} a new civic culture in which citizen participation was aimed at promoting clean elections and rule of law. In Chihuahua, Archbishop Adalberto Almeida y Merino began to be outspoken against electoral fraud and government corruption. Almeida issued a document in 1983 entitled [...] "Vote with Responsibility: A Christian Orientation," [...] in which the archbishop urged citizens to vote. Voter apathy had become a problem in Mexico, since many citizens saw the process as corrupt and assumed their vote would not count. Almeida called upon voters to participate and then continue involvement by monitoring winners’ performance in office. This document was the reassertion of the Church’s right to [...] "evangelize the totality of human existence including the political dimension." [...] The archbishop did not explicitly advocate for a particular party, although the National Action Party was gaining increasing numbers of votes in northern Mexico. In the municipal elections in Chihuahua that year, voter participation increased significantly and the <b>Institutional</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Party’s</b> candidates fared badly. This touched off an attack by the PRI, that denounced Church participation in elections, and a response from Almeida criticizing the PRI’s characterization, saying that their [...] "vision, {{in addition to being}} unjust, ingenuous, and arrogant, inevitably leads to an absolutist conception of power, with the consequent destruction of democracy." ...|$|R
