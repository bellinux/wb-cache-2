2500|$|When the <b>grid</b> <b>voltage</b> reaches 4.9 V, {{electron}} collisions {{near the}} grid become inelastic, and the electrons are greatly slowed. The kinetic {{energy of a}} typical electron arriving at the grid is reduced {{so much that it}} cannot travel further to reach the anode, whose voltage is set to slightly repel electrons. The current of electrons reaching the anode falls, as seen in the graph. Further increases in the <b>grid</b> <b>voltage</b> restore enough energy to the electrons that suffered inelastic collisions that they can again reach the anode. The current rises again as the grid potential rises beyond 4.9 V. [...] At 9.8 V, the situation changes again. [...] Electrons that have traveled roughly halfway from the cathode to the grid have already acquired enough energy to suffer a first inelastic collision. As they continue slowly towards the grid from the midway point, their kinetic energy builds up again, but as they reach the grid they can suffer a second inelastic collision. Once again, the current to the anode drops. [...] At intervals of 4.9 volts this process will repeat; each time the electrons will undergo one additional inelastic collision.|$|E

40|$|A grid {{connected}} inverter usually requires {{voltage and current}} measurements to control the active and reactive powers {{as well as the}} inverter output currents. While voltage sensors are essential to obtain reliable information on the phase angle, these additional components certainly increase the production costs and complexity. In this paper, a voltage-sensorless control scheme for a {{grid connected}} inverter using a disturbance observer (DOB) is presented. The <b>grid</b> <b>voltages</b> are estimated by DOB in the stationary reference frame using the current measurements and reference signals. Even though the DOB estimates the <b>grid</b> <b>voltages</b> with reasonable accuracy {{in the presence of the}} uncertainty such as the unbalanced condition and harmonic distortion, the resultant waveform shows a phase lag depending on the estimation bandwidth. To overcome this limitation, a phase lead compensation is introduced. By using these techniques, the phase angle of <b>grid</b> <b>voltages</b> can be completely restored even if the phase angle of grid is initially unknown. The proposed scheme is simple and straightforward. In addition, it does not require any additional hardware. The feasibility of the proposed voltage-sensorless control scheme is demonstrated through simulations and experiments using 2 kVA prototype inverter...|$|R
