Polypropylene fiber leads to an increase in the resisting strength, cracking resistance performance, resistance to impact performance and permeability reducing performance of the concrete, thus reduces the shrinking and deformation of the concrete. This paper uses the method of numerical analysis, assisted by the software of finite element analysis, makes both static and dynamic analysis on the polypropylene <b>fibrous</b> <b>concrete</b> ditch with different volume mixing. It results in the stress and strain table of the head and base plates of the polypropylene <b>fibrous</b> <b>concrete</b> ditch in the case of 0. 1 %, 0. 5 %, and 1 % volume mixing of polypropylene fibers.

Hooked steel fibers with 60 -mm length and an aspect ratio of 80, with three volume fractions of 0 %, 0. 5 %, and 1 % were used as the reinforcing material. In pre-determined mixtures, silica fume {{is used as a}} cement replacement material at 8 % weight of cement. The experimental results show that incorporation steel fibers improve the strength performance of concrete, particularly the splitting tensile and the flexural strengths. A remarkable improvement was observed in impact resistance of the <b>fibrous</b> <b>concretes,</b> as compared with the reference materials. The results demonstrate that when steel fiber is introduced into the specimens including silica fume, the impact resistance and the ductility of the resulting concrete are considerably increased. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Eleven half scale T-shaped post-tensioned simple beams were cast and tested in four points bending under the effect of a repeated load using a displacement control system up to failure. The test parameters were the fibers’ type (steel and polypropylene) and content, as well as the prestressing ratio (partially or fully). Key test results showed considerable enhancement in the crack distribution, crack width and spacing, concrete tensile strength and flexural stiffness in all beams with steel <b>fibrous</b> <b>concrete.</b> The latter aspects were directly proportional to the steel fibers’ contents. On the other hand, beams containing polypropylene fibers demonstrated a slight decrease in the flexural strength and a slight increase in flexural stiffness.

Based on the accumulated theoretical and experimental data it is determined that elastic and plastic deformations developed in the action under the action of the applied load due to the forming or development of different defects in concrete structures.

A total of twenty simply supported beams were tested. Ten of the twenty beams were cured under controlled laboratory conditions and the other ten were cured under severe hot dry climate (SHDC) characterized by their intense heat, Iow relative humidity, direct solar radiation, and large diurnal variations of daily temperatures. Tests were carried out 28 and 90 days after casting. Test results show that for non <b>fibrous</b> RC <b>concrete</b> beams the adverse effects of SHDC have more influence in reducing the flexural toughness than the flexural strength.

Moreover, the results reveal that the enhancements in these engineering properties due to the steel fiber addition are not affected by the above described severe field conditions.

40|$|AbstractSelf healing {{phenomenon}} of concrete {{has been observed}} in traditional, <b>fibrous,</b> self compacting <b>concrete.</b> This phenomenon occurred mainly due {{to the presence of}} unhydrated cement particles in the presence of water. Mechanism of polymer in concrete depends on creating a layer and net of polymer around cement particles which enhances the properties of polymer modified concrete. This mechanism may affect the self healing of this type of concrete. This work aims to study the presence of the self healing phenomenon in polymer modified concrete and the related parameters. An experimental investigation on self healing of polymer modified concrete was undertaken. In this research work, effect of polymer type, polymer dose, cement content, cement type, w/cm ratio and age of damage were studied. The healing process extended up to 60 days. Ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements were used to evaluate the healing process. Results indicated that, the self healing phenomenon existed in polymer modified concrete as in traditional concrete. The increase of polymer dose increases the healing degree at the same healing time. This increase depends on polymer type. Also, the decrease of w/cm ratio reduces the self healing degree while the use of Type V Portland cement improves the self healing process compared with Type I Portland cement. Cement content has an insignificant effect on healing process for both concrete with and without polymer. In addition, the increase of damage age decreases the efficiency of self healing process...|$|R
40|$|Several primary {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} through which soil aggregate road material properties may be improved. Such techniques basically involve a mechanism of creating a continuous matrix system of soil and/or aggregate particles, interlocked {{through the use of}} some additive such as portland cement, lime, or bituminous products. Details by which soils are stabilized vary greatly, but they are dependent on the type of stabilizing agent and nature of the soil, though the overall approach to stabilization has the common feature that improvement is achieved by some mechanism(s) forcing individual particles to adhere to one another. This process creates a more rigid material, most often capable of resisting the influx of water during freezing, loss of strength due to high moisture content and particle dispersion during thawing, and loss of strength due to migration of fines and/or water by capillarity and pumping. The study reported herein, took a new and relatively different approach to strengthening of soils, i. e., improvement of roadway soils and/or soil-aggregate materials by structural reinforcement with randomly oriented fibers. The {{purpose of the study was}} to conduct a laboratory and field investigation into the potential of improving (a) soil-aggregate surfaced and subgrade materials, including those that are frost-prone and/or highly moisture susceptible, and (b) localized base course materials, by uniting such materials through fibrous reinforcement. The envisioned objective of the project was the development of a simple construction technique(s) that could be (a) applied on a selective basis to specific areas having a history of poor performance, or (b) used for improvement of potential base materials prior to surfacing. Little background information on such purpose and objective was available. Though the envisioned process had similarities to <b>fibrous</b> reinforced <b>concrete,</b> and to <b>fibrous</b> reinforced resin composites, the process was devoid of a cementitious binder matrix and thus highly dependent on the cohesive and frictional interlocking processes of a soil and/or aggregate with the fibrous reinforcement; a condition not unlike the introduction of reinforcing bars into a concrete sand/aggregate mixture without benefit of portland cement. Thus the study was also directed to answering some fundamental questions: (1) would the technique work; (2) what type or types of fibers are effective; (3) are workable fibers commercially available; and (4) can such fibers be effectively incorporated with conventional construction equipment, and employed in practical field applications? The approach to obtaining answers to these questions, was guided by the philosophy that an understanding of basic fundamentals was essential to developing a body of engineering knowledge, that would serve as the basis for eventual development of design procedures with fibrous products for the applications previously noted...|$|R
40|$|To popularize nanoindustrial {{subjects}} in construction, to increase consumers’ confidence to nanotechnological products, the main results of Russian scientists’ research are publised as the abstracts. Within the frame «Production of modified <b>fibrous</b> <b>concrete</b> mixture, {{aimed at improving}} physical and mechanical properties through the components hardening the structure of <b>fibrous</b> <b>concrete</b> at micro- and nanolevels» it was experimentally proved that complex modifying additive containing carbon nanomodifier «Taunit» can be applied in production of steel fiber concrete and solution; compositions of steel fiber concrete with complex modifying additives and compositions of lightweight heat-resistant steel fiber concrete have been developed. Two Russian patents (№ 2361847, 2386599) for inventions have been obtained. Practical recommendations concerning application of <b>fibrous</b> <b>concrete</b> mixture with reinforcer made of fiber «Miksarm» and nanoadditives have been developed; technology for production of steel fiber concrete {{with the use of}} complex modifying additives has been offered. Within the frame «Development and optimization of façade plaster compositions with increased durability based on simple and complex binders with fine natural and artificial fillers and research of their structure» it was proved that there is potential and practicability to apply nanotechnological fillers of local origins in façade plasters affecting positively on the structure and properties of the composition; compositions of façade plasters based on simple and complex binders modified with nanotechnological mineral fillers with high properties which provide required resistance when operated (bond resistance, compressive strength, cold resistance) have been developed. As a result of systematic façade plaster optimization the share of construction market products has been minimized – binder savings are from 5 to 15...|$|E
