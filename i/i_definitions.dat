50|$|Diameters {{and their}} conjugates are defined in Book <b>I</b> (<b>Definitions</b> 4-6). Not every {{diameter}} has a conjugate. The topography of a diameter (Greek diametros) requires a regular curved figure. Irregularly-shaped areas, addressed in modern times, {{are not in}} the ancient game plan. Apollonius has in mind, of course, the conic sections, which he describes in often convolute language: “a curve in the same plane” is a circle, ellipse or parabola, while “two curves in the same plane” is a hyperbola. A chord is a straight line whose two end points are on the figure; i.e., it cuts the figure in two places. If a grid of parallel chords is imposed on the figure, then the diameter is defined as the line bisecting all the chords, reaching the curve itself at a point called the vertex. There is no requirement for a closed figure; e.g., a parabola has a diameter.|$|E

50|$|The Municipal Campaign Finance Code {{would become}} amended with an {{ordinance}} numbering 2007-OR-56 in city records. In this {{amendment to the}} Municipal Campaign Finance Code it begins with an introduction, Article <b>I</b> <b>definitions,</b> and then into Article II Section 2.4 Receiving and Collecting Gifts and Favors. Section 2.4 restricts {{the context in which}} gifts or favors are given and what can be given. It also explains who can give gifts or favors and what amounts in certain situations can be given. Section 2.5 City Owned Property addressed that use of property of the city is for official use only and all uses must be authorized prior to usage by city officials or employees. Then Section 2.6 Use or Disclosure of Confidential Information explains that officials, candidates, and city employees shall not disclose confidential information other than what required by law, performing his or her official duties, and as permitted in section 2.13. The Municipal Finance Code continues explanations in conflicts of interest regulating business conducted with people like family members of an official, representations of other people regulating how officials and employees represent the city or other persons in situations, post employment restrictions regulating how business is conducted after leaving a job with the city or official position, interests in city business regulating the interaction of business conducted with officials or employees for contracts, services, or other work. After those sections this amendment addresses the employment of Relative in which input is prohibited in the decision process of hiring someone of relation to an official or employee of the city. The hiring of relatives has been controversial for several mayor administrations in the past. The amendment then continues with political activity regulating officials, candidates, or employees interactions with other officials or employees political interests. As well as the limitations thus far the amendment addresses a Whistleblower Protection clause for people making reports with the Ethics Commission as long as they aren't knowingly making a false report. The rest of the amendment clarifies limitations of contributions to elected officials and candidates and the prohibition of accepting donations from individuals, entities, or corporations that have pending litigation against the city. Article III is the Financial Disclosure referencing an old ordinance numbered 94-OR-17 in the city records. Article IV Board of Ethics regulates the composition and powers of the board and confidentiality. Article V Sanctions for Violations explains employment sanctions, fines, and validity of contract. Article VI Miscellaneous Provisions regulating severability. Article VIII Effective Date which was passed by the Council on November 5, 2007 and then signed by mayor Rob Waiz on November 9.|$|E

We systematically reviewed existing CPGs on the HDPs (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy) to inform clinical practice. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Methodology Register, Health Technology Assessments, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (Ovid interface), Grey Matters, Google Scholar, and personal records were searched for CPGs on the HDPs (Jan/ 03 to Nov/ 13) in English, French, Dutch, or German. Of 13 CPGs identified, three were multinational and three developed for community/midwifery use. Length varied from 3 - 1188 pages and three guidelines did not formulate recommendations. Eight different grading systems were identified for assessing evidence quality and recommendation strength. No guideline scored ≧ 80 % on every domain of the AGREE II, a tool for assessing guideline methodological quality; two CPGs did so for 5 / 6 domains. Consistency was seen for (<b>i)</b> <b>definitions</b> of hypertension, proteinuria, chronic and gestational hypertension; (ii) pre-eclampsia prevention for women at increased risk: calcium when intake is low and low-dose aspirin, but not vitamins C and E or diuretics; (iii) antihypertensive treatment of severe hypertension; (iv) MgSO 4 for eclampsia and severe pre-eclampsia; (v) antenatal corticosteroids at < 34 wks when delivery is probable within 7 days; (vi) delivery for women with severe pre-eclampsia pre-viability or pre-eclampsia at term; and (vii) active management of the third stage of labour with oxytocin.

40|$|The idea of genre marks {{large-scale}} repeated {{patterns in}} human symbolic production and interaction, patterns that {{are taken to}} be meaningful. They thus can be defined by reference to pattern, or form, and by reference to theories of meaning and interaction. As a consequence, {{there are many ways}} to define genres, with some looking internally, to linguistic features and clusters of features, and others externally, to discourse communities and social interactions or recurrent rhetorical situations. Our discussion covered differences and difficulties with alternate ways of defining genres, their relevance to science and technology, explorations of the ways genres change or evolve, and pedagogical applications of genre analysis in scientific and technical discourse. 1 What follows is an outline of the issues and questions that our discussion raised.

Advances have been made this decade on meta-analysis and the understanding of the positive side of WF interface. Future research opportunities in this field will include a deeper understanding of how to effectively cope with WF conflict, how to achieve WF enrichment, the use of different methods (qualitative, longitudinal and experimental studies) on samples of new occupations, and how researchers could address methodological problems (causality, endogeneity, simultaneity, effect size, and self-selection bias) to better handle the complexity of WF issues...|$|E
