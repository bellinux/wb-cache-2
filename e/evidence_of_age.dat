60|$|It {{may seem}} illogical to the reader, but this {{deference}} {{on the part}} of the old soldier did not amuse me. On the contrary it hurt me. A little pang went through me every time he yielded his leadership. I hated to see him display the slightest <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> of weakness. I would rather have had him storm than sigh. Part of his irresolution, his timidity, was due, as I could see, to the unwonted noise, and to the crowds of excited men, but more of it came from the vague alarm of self-distrust which are signs of advancing years.|$|E

30|$|We omit {{at least}} two {{potentially}} important determinants of the early retirement decision in our analysis due to data limitations. First, previous studies like Johnson and Neumark (1997) find <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> discrimination {{in the work place}} in terms of both career prospects and the likelihood of job separations. Self-reported age discrimination may then be a relevant driver of the early retirement decision. 25 See Neumark (2009) for a review. Second, previous studies like Liebman and Luttmer (2012) have also assigned a specific role to individual expectations over future pension benefits and the rest of income components in shaping the labor supply of the elderly. We leave both extensions to future research.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTâ€”Levels of {{loneliness}} are relatively stable across most of adult life, but correlates {{of loneliness}} show age differences.

The effects {{of each of these}} pathways endow loneliness with the capacity to accelerate the rate of physiological decline with age. Additional research across the lifespan is re-quired {{to understand the nature of}} accrued loneliness ef-fects on health behavior and physiology in the short and long term.

The epoxy resin quickly showed <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> through color change and increased brittleness. The influence <b>of</b> <b>aging</b> on the material s glass transition temperature (Tg) was evaluated by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA).

40|$|Abstract This paper {{reviews the}} {{research}} literature on age discrimination in the employment interview and related contexts. Twenty one studies were identified which explored whether age discrimination occurs {{within the context of}} the employment interview since the Age Discrimination in Employment Act was put into law. Sixteen studies were conducted in laboratory settings. It was concluded that <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> discrimination in the employment interview is commonly observed in laboratory studies which do not assess the influence of other job-relevant characteristics. Laboratory studies may create too much artificiality, where the impact of qualifications is artificially minimized and the impact of irrelevant factors like age are maximized. Only 5 of the 21 studies were conducted in the field, but they found far less consequential age discrimination in the employment interview...|$|E
40|$|The book superstore is {{promoted}} {{not just as}} a place to buy books but also as a community resource in which to read, learn and socialise: traits that have in combination traditionally been the preserve of the public library. This study investigates the impact of the bookstore environment on public library space. The attitudes and behaviours of library and bookstore users were examined through focus group interviews and a self-completed questionnaire. Clear areas of overlap in the functions of the two sites were found, as was <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>age</b> and income-related splits in use and perception of bookstores and libraries. Results suggest attention should be paid to the beliefs and behaviours of young people and middle-income earners (the groups most noticeably increasing their use of the bookstore) and to the desired balance of education and recreation in the image and nature of the public library...|$|E
