50|$|The {{central core}} of the cattle yards {{comprises}} crushes for <b>de-horning,</b> cutting, drafting, dipping, and branding. Surrounding the stock working facilities of the central core, are the receiving, forcing and holding yards. The <b>de-horning</b> and cutting crush, cattle dip and stock loading ramp are in better condition than most sections of the yards, possibly through having remained in use and repair until {{the closure of the}} station. The loading ramp was built in the early 1960s and is the most recent structure. The most substantial feature of the yards is the cattle dip, which is of the conventional design and construction. The dip was built during the O'Beirne's tenure and is the earliest surviving structure within the yards. The walls of the dip are of concrete with concrete rendered steps and pit. Bush timber uprights and rafters support a corrugated iron roof that covers the dip itself. Steps lead out of the dip to a concrete-surfaced draining and pound yard. Beyond the dip is a large circular holding yard over 50 metres in diameter which forms a significant feature of the stockyards.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to evaluate the inter-observer reliability of a welfare monitoring scheme {{to be applied to}} sheep, and compare the welfare state of the animals between 10 organic and 10 conventional sheep farms. Two trained observers performed recordings. A graded point protocol was used, that relies on five sheets mostly derived by the Animal Needs Index, which is mainly based on resource-based parameters. Therefore, in the fifth sheet animal-based parameters, deemed relevant to sheep welfare, were taken into account. In particular, the following animal-based variableswere assessed: integument alterations, animal dirtiness, hoof overgrowth, lameness and lesions, which where scored {{on the basis of their}} prevalence (number of affected animals/numbers of observed animals), longevity (age in years), and mutilations, such as <b>de-horning</b> and caudotomy, evaluated in terms of presence/absence. No significant differences were observed between organic and conventional farms in terms of ANI scores, housing characteristics and animal-based parameters. This result was not surprising, as most of the farms, both conventional and organic, based their farming systems on an extensive use of the land by grazing animals. The monitoring protocol proved to be feasible (the mean time needed to perform the assessment of welfare was 85 min per farm) and reliable: a significant Spearman’s correlation coefficient between observers was observed for total score and all sheets. As to animal-based parameters, body condition could not be assessed visually due to the presence of flee in winter; the correlation between observers was significant for integument alterations, animal dirtiness, hoof overgrowth and lameness, whereas inter-observer reliability was not significant for lesions. This result indicated that more training is needed for the assessment of lesions in order to increase the reliability of the measure. In addition, we suggest visiting farms in early summer, soon after shearing, in order to make easier the detection of lesions and the assessment of body condition...|$|E
40|$|Screwworms are obligate, {{invasive}} parasites of warm-blooded animals. The female flies lay {{batches of}} eggs {{at the edge}} of wounds or other lesions. These eggs hatch to larvae or screw-worms which feed on affected animals for 6 - 7 days, burrowing deeply into subcutaneous tissues and causing severe trauma to animals, production loss and potentially death. Susceptible sites include wounds resulting from management practices such as castration, <b>de-horning</b> and ear tagging and lesions caused by the activities of other parasites such as buffalo flies and ticks. The navels of the new born and the vulval region of their mothers following parturition are highly susceptible and body orifices such as nose and ears are also frequent targets for ovipositing screwworm flies. The Old World screw-worm, Chrysomya bezziana (OWS) {{is considered one of the}} most serious exotic insect pest threatening Australia's livestock industries and is endemic in a number of our closest neighbouring countries. New World screwworm (NWS), Cochliomyia hominivorax, endemic to South America, has also entered Australia on at least 2 occasions. Many tropical and subtropical areas of Australia are suitable for the establishment of OWS and the potential range is expected to increase with climate change. The Australian screwworm preparedness strategy indicates a program of containment with chemical treatments followed by eradication of OWS using sterile male release and parasiticides. However, there is no longer an operational OWS sterile insect screw-worm facility anywhere in the world and establishing a large scale production facility would most optimistically take at least 2 years. In the interim, containment would be almost totally dependent on the availability of effective chemical controls. A review of chemical formulations available for potential use against OWS in Australia found that currently only one chemical, ivermectin administered by subcutaneous injection (s. c.) is registered for use against OWS and that many of the chemicals previously shown to be effective against OWS were no longer registered for animal use in Australia. 18 From this review a number of Australian-registered chemicals were recommended as a priority for testing against OWS. The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) can issue an emergency use permit for use of pesticides if they are registered in Australia for other animal uses and shown to be effective against OWS. This project tested the therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy of chemicals with potential for use in the treatment and control of OWS...|$|E
40|$|A newly-introduced pest poses {{a serious}} Ask for Africa's {{domestic}} and wild animals {{and also to}} the human population. It is the New World Screwworm fly (NWS), Cochliomyia hominivorax, or 'devourer of man''. Female screwworm flies lay their eggs in wounds such as insect bites, scratches, wounds caused by shearing, castration, <b>de-horning</b> and branding or the umbilicus of newborn animals. The eggs hatch into larvae, or maggots, which eat deeply into the living flesh; {{in a very short}} time a skin puncture or abrasion as small as a tick bite or scratch can be transformed into a large and dangerous wound. Unless treated quickly, even full grown cattle can die within days. The NSW is the most destructive pest of livestock in the Americas. Its presence outside the Western Hemisphere was confirmed for the first time in April 1989 in Libya. It is thought to have entered Libya on sheep imported from Latin America. The fly has been known to migrate up to 200 kilometres, although the pest most commonly spreads in the larval form through the transport of infested animals. The pest's range used to extend from Florida to Texas in the United States, through Central America and some Caribbean islands into the temperate zones of South America. It has already cost the US and Mexico US$ 500 million to eradicate the screwworm from the US and most of Mexico. It is feared that if the pest is not eradicated very quickly from Libya, it will spread into neighbouring countries, across the Sahara into tropical Africa and even around the Mediterranean basin, into Southern Europe, and possibly into West Asia. Eradication the aim It is possible to treat domestic livestock attacked by NWS but great expense and effort are involved. The possible effects on the wild animal population of Africa which cannot be treated, are alarming. Once infested, wild animals would become a continuing reservoir of infection probably causing more widespread and devastating losses than tsetse. The female screwworm lays clutches of up to 400 eggs at about three-day intervals before she dies. Larvae hatch 11 to 24 hours later and begin to feed on the host's tissues. The wounds produce an odour that then attracts more flies. After feeding and growing for four to eight days, the larvae drop to the ground, burrow into the soil and pupate. Adult flies emerge in as little as seven days and complete a life cycle that can be as short as three weeks (see diagram). The only worthwhile option is to eradicate the screwworm totally and the only proven technique is to combine the release of sterile male flies from the air with strict ground controls on the movements of animals, quarantine, monitoring and preventative treatment of wounds. The sterile insect technique (SIT) was pioneered in the US 33 years ago. A special rearing centre propagates flies and bombards the larvae with a carefully controlled dose of gamma radiation to make them sterile without weakening or reducing the male's desire to mate. The irradiated pupae are packaged and delivered to the infested area, ready to hatch. The flies are then loaded into light aircraft for dispersal. The technique is effective because the female NWS, mating with a sterile male, lays eggs that do not hatch. The female usually mates only once while the males mate five or six times; saturating an area with sterile males, that greatly outnumber the local fertile males, and results in population decline and eventual eradication. Action to-date The Libyan Government has already spent over $ 7. 5 million to fight the screwworm. It has fielded more than 90 teams to inspect and treat wounded animals every 21 days in the infested and adjacent areas and has set up 12 quarantine stations to control movement of animals. In July 1989, FAO and the UN Development Programme organized a regional training course for officials from Libya, Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Niger, Sudan, Morocco and Tunisia. A second training course was held in Libya in March for African countries farther from Libya, which are considered 'the second line of defence. ' And components for 1, 750, 000 animal treatment and sampling kits together with information material in Arabic, English and French have been provided to Libya and neighbouring countries. To meet the North African emergency, transport planes will make at least two deliveries each week of irradiated flies from Mexico to the operation headquarters in Libya. Millions of flies will be released to achieve a ratio of at least 10 sterile males to each local male. FAO estimates that it would cost $ 42 million per year for two years to mount a full eradication programme. However, this expense is only a fraction of the losses that a widespread infestation would cause. If it is not eradicated from Libya, the estimated costs of controlling the screwworm in the five countries of North Africa alone would exceed $ 250 million per year. The costs of further spread are incalculable: this is truly a now-or-never opportunity to eradicate screwworm from Africa.
