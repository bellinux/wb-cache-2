2500|$|In September 2007, Boeing {{announced}} a three-month delay, blaming {{a shortage of}} fasteners as well as incomplete software. On October 10, 2007, a second three-month delay to the first flight and a six-month delay to first deliveries was announced due to supply chain problems, a lack of documentation from overseas suppliers, and <b>flight</b> <b>guidance</b> software delays. Less than a week later, Mike Bair, the 787 program manager was replaced. On January 16, 2008, Boeing {{announced a}} third three-month delay to the first flight of the 787, citing insufficient progress on [...] "traveled work". On March 28, 2008, {{in an effort to}} gain more control over the supply chain, Boeing announced plans to buy Vought Aircraft Industries' interest in Global Aeronautica; a later agreement was also made to buy Vought's factory in North Charleston.|$|E

50|$|Published from 1970 to 1991, the {{bi-monthly}} publication was oriented towards expert {{analysis of}} diverse aviation topics. Considering {{the quality and}} sourcing of data in aircraft aerodynamics, <b>flight</b> mechanics, <b>guidance</b> and control, materials, construction, propulsion systems, ground aids, aviation medicine, aviation law and regulations, as well as, news from other air forces, it gathered a substantial expert base.|$|R
40|$|An ongoing {{series of}} joint NASA/FAA {{helicopter}} Microwave Landing System (MLS) flight tests {{was conducted at}} Ames Research Center. This paper deals with tests done from the spring through the fall of 1983. This flight test investigated and developed {{solutions to the problem}} of manually flying curved-path and steep glide slope approaches into the terminal area using the MLS and <b>flight</b> director <b>guidance.</b> An MLS-equipped Bell UH- 1 H helicopter flown by NASA test pilots was used to develop approaches and procedures for flying these approaches. The approaches took the form of Straight-in, U-turn, and S-turn flightpaths with glide slopes of 6 deg, 9 deg, and 12 deg. These procedures were evaluated by 18 pilots from various elements of the helicopter community, flying a total of 221 hooded instrument approaches. Flying these curved path and steep glide slopes was found to be operationally acceptable with <b>flight</b> director <b>guidance</b> using the MLS...|$|R
5000|$|... {{navigation}} data and symbolsâ€”for approaches and landings, the <b>flight</b> <b>guidance</b> systems can provide visual cues based on navigation aids {{such as an}} Instrument Landing System or augmented Global Positioning System such as the Wide Area Augmentation System. Typically this is a circle which fits inside the flight path vector symbol. Pilots can fly along the correct flight path by [...] "flying to" [...] the guidance cue.|$|E
50|$|The image {{indicates}} a wings level aircraft (i.e. the flight path vector symbol is flat {{relative to the}} horizon line and there is zero roll on the turn/bank indicator). Airspeed is 140 knots, altitude is 9,450 feet, heading is 343 degrees (the number below the turn/bank indicator). Close inspection of the image shows a small purple circle which is displaced from the flight path vector slightly to the lower right. This is the guidance cue coming from the <b>Flight</b> <b>Guidance</b> System. When stabilized on the approach, this purple symbol should be centered within the FPV.|$|E
50|$|On {{aircraft}} avionics systems, HUDs typically operate from dual independent redundant computer systems. They receive input {{directly from the}} sensors (pitot-static, gyroscopic, navigation, etc.) aboard the aircraft and perform their own computations rather than receiving previously computed data from the flight computers. On other aircraft (the Boeing 787, for example) the HUD guidance computation for Low Visibility Take-off (LVTO) and low visibility approach comes from the same <b>flight</b> <b>guidance</b> computer that drives the autopilot. Computers are integrated with the aircraft's systems and allow connectivity onto several different data buses such as the ARINC 429, ARINC 629, and MIL-STD-1553.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this effort is to determine IFR approach path and touchdown dispersions for manual and automatic XV- 15 tilt rotor landings, and to develop missed approach criteria. Only helicopter mode XV- 15 operation is considered. The analysis and design sections develop the automatic and <b>flight</b> director <b>guidance</b> equations for decelerating curved and straight-in approaches into a typical VTOL landing site equipped with an MLS navigation aid. These system designs satisfy all known pilot-centered, guidance and control requirements for this flying task. Performance data, obtained from nonstationary covariance propagation dispersion analysis for the system, are used to develop the approach monitoring criteria. The autoland and <b>flight</b> director <b>guidance</b> equations are programmed for the VSTOLAND 1819 B digital computer. The system design dispersion data developed through analysis and the 1819 B digital computer program are verified and refined using the fixed-base, man-in-the-loop XV- 15 VSTOLAND simulation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the second part}} of the research activities carried out to develop a novel Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Avionics-Based Integrity Augmentation (ABIA) system for manned and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications. The ABIA system&# 039;s architecture was developed to allow real-time avoidance of safety-critical flight conditions and fast recovery of the required navigation performance in case of GNSS data losses. In more detail, our novel ABIA system addresses all four cornerstones of GNSS integrity augmentation in mission- and safety-critical avionics applications: prediction (caution flags), avoidance (optimal <b>flight</b> path <b>guidance),</b> reaction (warning flags) and correction (recovery <b>flight</b> path <b>guidance).</b> Part 1 (Sabatini et al., 2012) presented the ABIA concept, architecture and key mathematical models used to describe GNSS integrity issues in aircraft applications.

40|$|The {{navigation}} and <b>flight</b> director <b>guidance</b> systems {{implemented in the}} NASA/FAA helicopter microwave landing system (MLS) curved approach flight test program is described. Flight test were conducted at the U. S. Navy's Crows Landing facility, using the NASA Ames UH-lH helicopter equipped with the V/STOLAND avionics system. The purpose of these tests {{was to investigate the}} feasibility of flying complex, curved and descending approaches to a landing using MLS <b>flight</b> director <b>guidance.</b> A description of the navigation aids used, the avionics system, cockpit instrumentation and on-board navigation equipment used for the flight test is provided. Three generic reference flight paths were developed and flown during the test. They were as follows: U-Turn, S-turn and Straight-In flight profiles. These profiles and their geometries are described in detail. A 3 -cue flight director was implemented on the helicopter. A description of the formulation and implementation of the flight director laws is also presented. Performance data and analysis is presented for one pilot conducting the flight director approaches...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally {{autoland}} {{systems have}} been very expensive, and have been rare on small aircraft. However, as display technology has developed {{the addition of a}} Head Up Display (HUD) allows for a trained pilot to manually fly the aircraft using guidance cues from the <b>flight</b> <b>guidance</b> system. This significantly reduces the cost of operating in very low visibility, and allows aircraft which are not equipped for automatic landings to make a manual landing safely at lower levels of look ahead visibility or runway visual range (RVR). In 1989, Alaska Airlines was the first airline in the world to manually land a passenger-carrying jet (Boeing B727) in FAA Category III weather (dense fog) made possible with the Head-Up Guidance System.|$|E
50|$|During the 1980s, the {{military}} tested {{the use of}} HUDs in vertical {{take off and landing}}s (VTOL) and short take off and landing (STOL) aircraft. A HUD format was developed at NASA Ames Research Center to provide pilots of V/STOL aircraft with complete <b>flight</b> <b>guidance</b> and control information for Category III C terminal-area flight operations. This includes a large variety of flight operations, from STOL flights on land-based runways to VTOL operations on aircraft carriers. The principal features of this display format are the integration of the flightpath and pursuit guidance information into a narrow field of view, easily assimilated by the pilot with a single glance, and the superposition of vertical and horizontal situation information. The display is a derivative of a successful design developed for conventional transport aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Guidance is the [...] "driver" [...] of a vehicle. It takes {{input from}} the {{navigation}} system (where am I) and uses targeting information (where do I want to go) to send signals to the flight control system {{that will allow the}} vehicle to reach its destination (within the operating constraints of the vehicle). The [...] "targets" [...] for guidance systems are one or more state vectors (position and velocity) and can be inertial or relative. During powered <b>flight,</b> <b>guidance</b> is continually calculating steering directions for flight control. For example, the space shuttle targets an altitude, velocity vector, and gamma to drive main engine cut off. Similarly, an Intercontinental ballistic missile also targets a vector. The target vectors are developed to fulfill the mission and can be preplanned or dynamically created.|$|E

5000|$|Not {{all of the}} {{passenger}} aircraft flying today have an autopilot system. Older and smaller general aviation aircraft especially are still hand-flown, and even small airliners with fewer than twenty seats may also be without an autopilot as they are used on short-duration flights with two pilots. The installation of autopilots in aircraft with more than twenty seats is generally made mandatory by international aviation regulations. There are three levels of control in autopilots for smaller aircraft. A single-axis autopilot controls an aircraft in the roll axis only; such autopilots are also known colloquially as [...] "wing levellers," [...] reflecting their limitations. A two-axis autopilot controls an aircraft in the pitch axis as well as roll, and may {{be little more than}} a [...] "wing leveller" [...] with limited pitch oscillation-correcting ability; or it may receive inputs from on-board radio navigation systems to provide true automatic <b>flight</b> <b>guidance</b> once the aircraft has taken off until shortly before landing; or its capabilities may lie somewhere between these two extremes. A three-axis autopilot adds control in the yaw axis and is not required in many small aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The 9M123 missile is supersonic, {{flying at}} an average speed of 400 m/s or Mach 1.2 and has a range of between 400 and 6,000 meters. Propulsion is {{by way of a}} single solid fuel rocket motor with two {{exhausts}} {{on either side of the}} missile. The off-set exhausts cause the missile to spin during <b>flight.</b> <b>Guidance</b> control is provided by two pop-out control surfaces at the rear of the missile (four additional surfaces help stabilise the missile during flight). The Khrizantema is unique among Russian anti-tank guided missiles as, depending on the variant the missile, it can either be guided by laser or radar. The radar unit uses the millimeter wave band and the system automatically tracks the target and guides the missile in the radar beam; this form of guidance is LOSBR (Line-Of-Sight Beam Riding) that is ACLOS. When guided using a laser, a continuous laser beam is generated towards the target and a sensor in the rear section enables the missile to ride the laser beam to the target; this form of guidance is LOSBR that is SACLOS. This dual guidance system allows two missiles to be fired at two separate targets at once, with one missile guided by laser and the other by radar. Each missile carries a tandem HEAT warhead with a reported penetration of 1100-1250 mm RHA behind ERA, alternatively a thermobaric warhead can be carried to engage soft-skinned targets, fortifications and manpower.|$|E
