The sandwiches were introduced {{at the insistence of}} the new CEO, former Darden Restaurants executive Bradley (Brad) Blum, shortly after the company was acquired by TPG Capital in 2002. The sandwiches were designed to be a lower fat alternative with 5g of fat and 350 or <b>fewer</b> <b>calories.</b> The line was a health conscious oriented product that got its taste from ingredients instead of fat.

25|$|Some people—including German soldiers—benefited {{from the}} black market, where food was sold without tickets at very high prices. Farmers {{especially}} diverted meat to the black market, which meant that much less for the open market. Counterfeit food tickets were also in circulation. Direct buying from farmers in the countryside and barter against cigarettes became common. These activities were strictly forbidden, however, and thus carried the risk of confiscation and fines. Food shortages were most acute in the large cities. In the more remote country villages, clandestine slaughtering, vegetable gardens {{and the availability of}} milk products permitted better survival. The official ration provided starvation level diets of one thousand thirteen or <b>fewer</b> <b>calories</b> a day, supplemented by home gardens and, especially, black market purchases.|$|E
25|$|Fifty years ago, {{the common}} {{perception}} was that water was an infinite resource. At the time, {{there were fewer}} than half the current number {{of people on the}} planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed <b>fewer</b> <b>calories</b> and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for the fixed amount of water resources is much more intense, giving rise to the concept of peak water. This is because there are now nearly seven billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from industry, urbanisation and biofuel crops. In future, even more water will be needed to produce food because the Earth's population is forecast to rise to 9 billion by 2050.|$|E

40|$|Obesity and obesity-related disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and {{cardiovascular}} disease, are epidemic in Western countries, particularly the United States. The conventional wisdom holds that obesity is primarily {{the result of}} a positive energy balance, i. e. too many calories in and too <b>few</b> <b>calories</b> burned. Although it is self-evident that fat cannot be accumulated without a higher caloric intake than expenditure, recent research in a number of laboratories suggests the existence of chemicals that alter regulation of energy balance to favor weight gain and obesity. These obesogens derail the homeostatic mechanisms important for weight control, such that exposed individuals are predisposed to weight gain, despite normal diet and exercise. This review considers the evidence for obesogens, how they might act, and where future research is needed to clarify their relative contribution to the obesity epidemic...|$|R
50|$|UNICEF and WHO {{recommended}} that children be exclusively breastfed (no other liquid, solid food, or plain water) {{during the first}} six months of life (WHO/UNICEF, 2002). The nutrition program under the 2004 National Nutrition Policy and Strategy promotes exclusive breastfeeding through the age of 6 months and, thereafter, the introduction of semisolid or solid foods along with continued breast milk until the child is at least age 2. Introducing breast milk substitutes to infants before age 6 months can contribute to breastfeeding failure. Substitutes, such as formula, other kinds of milk, and porridge, are often watered down and provide too <b>few</b> <b>calories.</b> Furthermore, possible contamination of these substitutes exposes the infant to the risk of illness. Nepal’s Breast Milk Substitute Act (2049) of 1992 promotes and protects breastfeeding and regulates the unauthorized or unsolicited sale and distribution of breast milk substitutes.|$|R

5000|$|There is {{a change}} in the {{attitude}} of individuals when they are told that a snack is either healthy or unhealthy. Janet Polivy and C. Peter Herman noted that individuals generally believe that whether a snack is healthy or not is based on its calorie and fat content. A “healthy” food is thought to contain <b>few</b> <b>calories,</b> and an “unhealthy” food is thought to contain many calories. Adding to that, restaurants that claim they serve “healthy” foods sometimes lead their customers to believe their food has low calorie content. [...] Noting the perception of individuals of the healthiness of foods, snacks are perceived similarly to other foods and can be regarded as healthy or unhealthy based on their caloric content. Polivy and Herman found, in a study they performed on the perceived healthiness of a snack, that if the snack were regarded as healthy the participants ate 35% more of it than of snacks regarded as unhealthy.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIt {{is crucial}} that {{emergent}} technologies create foods that help prevent the causal mechanisms of the diet induced disease epidemic. Food nanotechnology could create modem convenience foods that mimic and improve on the nutritional value of the most nutritious cooked wild foods for humans. Structuring a solid processed food similar to a celery stalk using self-assembled, water-filled, edible nanocells or nanotubes would substantially lower its energy density (< 1. 6 kcal g(- 1)). Food technologists could harness the natural turgor force to produce a firm chocolate bar, biscuit or breakfast cereal with a good bite, without altering the appearance or taste of the product. Water carries flavour with <b>few</b> <b>calories,</b> and taste sensation per mouthful could be improved by processing food on the nanoscale to increase the surface area that is in contact with taste and smell receptors. The bioavailable nutrient content (including cofactors) of processed foods could be increased by existing bioactive nanoencapsulation. This would allow people to continue to consume modern convenience food on a mass scale, while simultaneously and significantly increasing nutrient intake and reducing energy intake per day. Thus, helping to reduce mental ill health, obesity and other postprandial insults...|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS School-based cross-sectional study conducted in 2 private and 2 government schools of a rural area in Trivandrum district. Total 800 students (200 from each school) aged 11 - 15 years in 6 th to 10 th standards were selected by systematic random sampling and consent were obtained.
