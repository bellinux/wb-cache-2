40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to precipitate dissolved copper, zinc, and lead from simulated wastewater solutions as solids which could then be separated by filtration. The precipitants used were hydrated lime, as a slurry and in powdered form, aqueous ammonium hydroxide, <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphide</b> sludge, and carbon dioxide gas. These five different chemicals, singly or in combination, were used; {{at least one of}} which was highly successful in precipitating each of the metals, removing at least 99 % of that originally present. Copper and zinc were very effectively precipitated as the hydroxides with lime, whereas lead was not. Considering lead to be the most difficult metal to remove, four other chemical conditions were attempted for lead; these were <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphide</b> alone, lime with <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphide,</b> lime with carbon dioxide, and lime with ozone. The precipitation of lead with <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphide</b> alone, was only partially successful with only 95 % removal. The other three combinations of chemicals precipitated more than 99 % of the soluble lead, giving excellent results. Furthermore, because lead is usually difficult to remove from solution, it is considered that the three new chemical combinations show strong promise for the removal of other heavy metals from wastewater solutions. Experiments were also conducted to decompose the organic compounds, formaldehyde and pyridine, in simulated wastewater solutions in a mixed reactor, using ozone and UV radiation as oxidants. Although 200 ppm Total Organic Carbon content of each of those chemicals, and a mixture of both, were completely decomposed by ozone-UV oxidation, the time taken for these decompositions ranged from about three to four hours. Such prolonged reaction times are considered too long for most wastewater treating processes. However, low concentrations of organic matter might be successfully treated using ozone/UV processes...|$|E

This paper discusses the utility of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans for the selective flotation of chalcopyrite from pyrite. Consequent to interaction with bacterial cells, pyrite remained depressed even {{in the presence of}} potassium isopropyl xanthate collector while chalcopyrite exhibited significant flotability. However, when the minerals were conditioned together, the selectivity achieved was poor due to the activation of pyrite surface by the copper ions in solution. The selectivity was improved when the sequence of conditioning with bacterial cells and collector was reversed, since the bacterial cells were able to depress collector interacted pyrite effectively, while having negligible effect on chalcopyrite. The observed behaviour is analysed and discussed in detail. The separation obtained was significant both at acidic and alkaline pH. This selectivity achieved was retained when the minerals were interacted with both bacterial cells and collector simultaneously...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: There {{are many}} strains and perhaps {{several species of}} sulphate-reducing bacteria. They may be {{isolated}} by {{using a variety of}} media over a wide range of temperature. Crude cultures are readily obtained, but isolation of absolutely pure cultures is usually difficult. Considerable simplification in procedure may sometimes be effected by including 3 yo Na,SO,. 7 H,O in the media; the sulphite eliminates most of the contaminating organisms in crude cultures and facilitates subsequent. purification. A method of maintaining stock cultures on sterile clay is preferred to the use of artificial media. No growth takes place in media rendered ‘biologically free ’ of iron, but the traces normally present in media constituents AS impurities are sufficient for good develop-ment. Rapid and abundant growth free from <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphide</b> has been obtained in a mineral salts + lactate + yeast extract medium containing ferrous ions below thc saturation concentration for <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphide.</b> One thermophilic and four mesophilic strains {{have been shown to be}} facultative autotrophs, using the oxidation of hydrogen as energy source, with sulphate, sulphite...|$|E

30|$|There {{has been}} a long {{tradition}} of studying lichens, including Acarospora sens. lat. found on metalliferous rocks and slags, especially in Central Europe (Hilitzer, 1923; Schade, 1933; Lange and Ziegler, 1963; Poelt and Ullrich, 1964; Noeske et al., 1970; Wirth, 1972; Hauck et al., 2007). The term ‘chalcophile’ (‘copper-loving’) was first used in a lichenological sense (Poelt and Ullrich, 1964) to describe lichens more-or-less restricted to metalliferous rocks, slags and ores. Volkmar Wirth (Poelt and Ullrich, 1972) was the first to suggest that it was the low pH, rather than iron and other metals, that was responsible for their development. <b>Ferrous</b> <b>sulphides</b> are the principal acid-forming constituents of mine spoils which liberate dilute sulphuric acid as a result of bacterially assisted oxidative weathering and which leads to ‘acid mine drainage’, a major source of metal contamination (Jenkins et al., 2000). The Acarosporion sinopicae community, characterised by the obligate rust-coloured Acarospora sinopica, is characteristic of such acidic environments (Wirth, 1972) (Figure  2 A). With particular reference to sulphide-rich substrata, metamorphosed in greenschist facies, in central Scandinavia, the author’s multi-disciplinary doctoral studies illustrated the complexity of the interrelationships between Cu and Fe minerals, pH and other ecological factors in determining assemblage composition (Purvis, 1985). A new lichen community was described related to cupriferous habitats at near neutral to slightly basic pH where characteristic Acarospora taxa occurred, including A. rugulosa Koerber (Figure  3 D) and distinctive yellow-green Acarospora and lichens belonging to other saxicolous lichen genera (Aspicilia, Bellemerea, Lecidea, Lecanora) exhibiting a similar colour. The importance of a mineralogical understanding was highlighted, which determines the availability of elements to saxicolous crustose lichens intimately associated with the substratum through weathering processes which may involve the lichen itself (Purvis, 1985; Purvis and Halls, 1996; Purvis, 2000).|$|R

Copper (I) sulphide further react with oxygen and remain as Cu metal in the soil. Again, SO 2 reacts with oxygen and produce SO 3 and finally SO 3 reacts with water and produce H 2 SO 4.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to propose a {{granulation}} mechanism in order to interpret all the experimental observations that arose during experiments on two UASB reactors, where one was supplemented with ferrous iron at a dose of 0. 01 g Fe 2 + per g COD feed. This supplementation with ferrous iron allowed COD removal of more than 98 % at a loading rate of 9 g COD/L per day, which was 24 % higher than for the reactor not receiving the ferrous iron. Moreover, in the Fe 2 +-dosed reactor, a higher increase of the granule diameter was observed. Indeed, the granule diameter in the Fe 2 +-dosed reactor {{at the end of the}} experiments was 56 % greater than that of the control reactor, This mechanism describes the course of anaerobic granule growth.

40|$|The {{effect of}} ferrous ion {{addition}} on the granularity of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was investigated. Two UASB reactors (R 1 and R 2) (35 degrees C; pH 7) were operated for 3 {{months at a}} 20 -h hydraulic retention time (HRT) at organic loads from 1. 4 to 10. 0 g COD L- 1 d(- 1). Ferrous iron was fed only to reactor R 1 {{in a range of}} load from 0. 014 to 0. 100 g Fe 2 + L- 1 d(- 1). The addition of ferrous iron induced a stable and excellent COD conversion rate. The enhancement of the performance of reactor R 1 may be accredited to the mean granule diameter increase {{as well as to the}} Sludge bed porosity decrease. The addition of iron to reactor R 1 had a pronounced effect on the quality of the granular sludge, increasing the characteristic settling velocities.

30|$|Colour is a {{qualitative}} characteristic {{that can be}} used to assess the general condition of wastewater. Wastewater that is light brown in colour is less than 6  h old, while a light-to-medium grey colour is characteristic of wastewaters that have undergone some degree of decomposition or that have been in the collection system for some time. Lastly, if the colour is dark grey or black, the wastewater is typically septic, having undergone extensive bacterial decomposition under anaerobic conditions (Buvaneswaril et al. 2013). The blackening of wastewater is often due to the formation of various sulphides, particularly <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphide.</b> This results when hydrogen sulphide produced under anaerobic conditions combines with divalent metal, such as iron, which may be present. In the present investigation, the colour of the untreated effluent was dark yellow. Similar studies by different authors found that the colour was dark brownish (Kolhe et al. 2009) black (Samuel and Muthukkaruppan 2011), yellow (Baskaran et al. 2009), and reddish yellow (Hampannavar and Shivayogimath 2010).

40|$|Pre-photosynthetic niches were meagre with a {{productivity}} of {{much less than}} 10 − 4 of modern photosynthesis. Serpentinization, arc volcanism and ridge-axis volcanism reliably provided H 2. Methanogens and acetogens reacted CO 2 with H 2 to obtain energy and make organic matter. These skills pre-adapted a bacterium for anoxygenic photosynthesis, probably starting with H 2 in lieu of an oxygen ‘acceptor’. Use of <b>ferrous</b> iron and <b>sulphide</b> followed as abundant oxygen acceptors, allowing productivity to approach modern levels. The ‘photobacterium’ proliferated rooting much of the bacterial tree. Land photosynthetic microbes faced a dearth of oxygen acceptors and nutrients. A consortium of photosynthetic and soil bacteria aided weathering and access to ferrous iron. Biologically enhanced weathering {{led to the formation}} of shales and, ultimately, to granitic rocks. Already oxidized iron-poor sedimentary rocks and low-iron granites provided scant oxygen acceptors, as did freshwater in their drainages. Cyanobacteria evolved dioxygen production that relieved them of these vicissitudes. They did not immediately dominate the planet. Eventually, anoxygenic and oxygenic photosynthesis oxidized much of the Earth's crust and supplied sulphate to the ocean. Anoxygenic photosynthesis remained important until there was enough O 2 in downwelling seawater to quantitatively oxidize massive sulphides at mid-ocean ridge axes...|$|R

Pyrolysis {{of the coal}} usually requires iron minerals for activation step to both absorption microwave from the matrix of the sulphides and conduct the heat to coal for pyrolysis. In this investigation, the copper pyrite and coal pyrite was microwave roasted to oxidize both the sulphides and even the pyrolysis of coal for reduction iron oxide. The effects were investigated by gravimetric and infrared analysis and the microwave absorption characteristics were quantified by determining the permittivities. The microwave heating behaviour studies showed that the sample temperature increased with increasing incident microwave power, processing time and sample mass. Due to {{the activity of the}} iron ore to the microwaves, a low incident power of 600 W was found to be sufficient for roasting, as higher powers resulted in sintering and melting of the concentrate. The copper pyrite weight loss values after roasting were over 25 % and these were similar to those obtained by conventional roasting. The main advantages of microwave roasting were that both the total pyrolysis rates and the heating rates were higher and the specific energy consumptions were lower than in coal pyrite. In this study; low-grade iron ore and sponge iron pyrite by high production of waste parched areas were carried out. X-ray diffraction analysis of the products mineralogy and grain size in polarizing microscopic description is determined {{by the nature of the}} leaching effect on the physical and chemical parameters.

40|$|Typically {{the iron}} {{bacteria}} {{are described as}} ferrous iron (Fe 2 +) oxidisers (with oxy¬gen) to ferric iron (Fe 3 +). Exposure of <b>ferrous</b> iron and <b>sulphide</b> containing ground¬water to atmospheric oxygen forms the well known phenomena of ferric iron and sulphur precipitation which typically, but not necessarily, involves iron and sulphide oxidising bacteria. In this process ferrous iron serves as the electron donor and mo¬lecular oxygen as the electron acceptor. The flow of electrons from ferrous iron to oxygen enables the respiration process of the bacteria and allows their growth. Also insoluble iron species allow an electron flow that bacteria can use for their respira¬tion and growth. Two such examples are covered in this paper: 1. Bacterially influenced corrosion of steel. The iron in steel (Fe 0) is even more reduced than ferrous iron and hence offers a more attractive electron donor for bacteria. Sulphate-Reducing bacteria can utilise the electrons from metallic iron using sulphate, sulphite or elemental sulphur as electron acceptor. Again, this elec¬tron flow from metallic iron to sulphate provides the bacteria with a suitable energy source for growth. And like usual this electron flow is used for respiration, here an anaerobic respiration. Sulphate-Reducing bacteria (SRB) {{play an important role}} in the corrosion of steel in anaerobic environments, such as oilfields, marine sediments, treatment tanks etc. This paper covers the principle and examples of steel corrosion by SRB. 2. Bacterial reduction of ferric iron to ferrous iron. Also the most oxidized form of iron, ferric iron can be used by bacteria for growth. However, as it is in its most oxidised form it can not act as electron donor but as electron acceptor. Analogous to the oxygen respiration using O 2 as electron acceptor for electrons derived from the oxidation of organic material, iron reducing bacteria can ʻrespireʼ ferric iron. This reaction occurs typically in anaerobic ecosystems with organic compounds (e. g. or¬ganic acids) as the electron donor. The role and economic potential of iron reducing bacteria in groundwater are discussed in this paper. Both the above cases of iron metabolism involve insoluble species of iron. As bacte¬ria by definition can only metabolise soluble material, specific mechanisms need to be in place that enable the electron transfer. This paper discusses possibilities and implications of such electron flow by also covering other species relevant to ground¬water chemistry (e. g. elemental sulphur and chlorinated solvents) ...|$|R

Pyrite generated more H 2 O 2 than the other sulphide minerals and the order of H 2 O 2 production by the minerals {{was found to be}} pyrite > chalcopyrite >sphalerite> galena. The pH of water influenced the extent of hydrogen peroxide formation where higher amounts of H 2 O 2 were produced at highly acidic pH. The amount of H 2 O 2 formed also increased with increasing sulphide mineral loading and grinding time due to increased surface area and its interaction with water. The sulphide surfaces are highly catalytically active due to surface defect sites and unsaturation because of broken bonds and capable of breaking down the water molecule leading to hydroxyl free radicals. The type of grinding medium on {{formation of}} hydrogen peroxide by pyrite revealed that the mild steel produced more H 2 O 2 than stainless steel grinding medium, where Fe 2 + and/or Fe 3 + ions {{played a key role in}} producing higher amounts of H 2 O 2. Furthermore, the effect of mixed sulphide minerals, i. e., pyrite–chalcopyrite, pyrite–galena, chalcopyrite–galena and sphalerite–pyrite, sphalerite–chalcopyrite and sphalerite–galena on the formation of H 2 O 2 showed increasing H 2 O 2 formation with increasing pyrite fraction in chalcopyrite–pyrite composition. In pyrite–sphalerite, chalcopyrite–sphalerite or galena– sphalerite mixed compositions, with the increase in pyrite or chalcopyrite proportion, the concentration of H 2 O 2 increased but with increase in galena proportion, the concentration of H 2 O 2 decreased. By increasing the pyrite proportion in pyrite–galena mixture, the concentration of H 2 O 2 increased. Similarly, in the mixture of chalcopyrite–galena, the concentration of H 2 O 2 increased with increasing chalcopyrite fraction. The results of H 2 O 2 formation in pulp liquid of individual sulphide minerals and in combination at different experimental conditions have been explained by Eh–pH diagrams of these minerals and the existence of free metal ions that are equally responsible for H 2 O 2 formation besides the catalytic activity of surfaces. The results of the amount of H 2 O 2 production also corroborate with the rest potential of the sulphide minerals; higher the rest potential more is the formation of H 2 O 2.

Subsequently these minerals are converted to oxyhydroxide, oxide and sulphate minerals to form gossans, where specific iron oxide assemblages can be associated with ore bodies and potentially correlated with a definite host rock composition. Owing to the links between gossans and ore deposits, much {{attention has been paid to}} mapping gossans by remote sensing means. In some studies the spectral shape of gossans in the visible-near infrared wavelength region has been exploited for determining their mineralogical composition. However, little attention has been paid to the possible effects of spectral mixing of oxidized surfaces with lichens or host rock substrates. In this study we have investigated the effects of lichens and host rocks on the spectral properties of gossans by means of near-infrared and short-wave infrared hyperspectral data acquired from samples and from airborne data for the Ni-Cu bearing Cape Smith Belt in northern Canada. Fifty-eight rock samples, twenty-three of which are gossans, were collected from the study area across sedimentary, mafic and ultramafic rocks. Spectral measurements were acquired from these samples by means of the ASD FieldSpec 3 spectrometer and Sisurock imaging system that acquires sample imagery at high spatial resolution (0. 8 mm in the visible-near infrared region). These measurements were used to build a series of synthetic spectral mixtures comparing gossans to lichens and rocks that do not have an oxidized surface. The analysis was constrained by means of X-ray diffraction, which provided information on the mineralogy of the samples. The synthetic mixtures were used to investigate the effects of lichens and rock substrates on spectra of gossans. Furthermore, the laboratory spectrometry of the gossan samples was compared to 10. 7 km 2 of hyperspectral airborne imagery acquired over the study area where the objective was to study how lichens affect the spectral properties of gossans at a large scale. Results show that different lichen species have an impact on the spectral shape of gossans in the near infrared wavelength region, consistent with previous studies. Moreover, some gossans are optically thin, meaning that the thickness of the oxidized surface does not completely prevent the transmission of light onto the host rock mineralogy. Implications include: i) the host rock mineralogy can be spectrally mixed with the gossan mineralogy and ii) the host rock mineralogy can be detected by remote sensing means. The latter finding is important from a mineral exploration point of view, especially in areas where there is a known association between specific rock types and ore deposits. However, our findings also suggest that the spectral shape of the iron oxide minerals can only be relied upon as a mineral identification method in the absence of lichens and when the gossans are optically thick...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge about {{biogeochemical}} processes {{associated with}} natural attenuation of chlorinated solvents {{in the environment}} is currently limited. Though processes such as sorption, volatilization or dilution may contribute to contaminant natural attenuation, in situ biodegradation is the only process leading to destructive removal of contaminants. However, the distribution of hydrological and hydrochemical processes over both spatial and temporal scales influence degradation reactions, and thus {{should be taken into}} account when assessing in situ biodegradation in complex systems. This thesis aimed at gathering knowledge about in situ biodegradation of chlorinated solvents and associated biogeochemical processes within both contaminated wetlands and aquifers. The specific objectives of this thesis were i) to develop and apply an approach in order to demonstrate in situ degradation of toxic reductive dechlorination intermediates such as dichloroethenes (DCE), vinyl chloride (VC) and chlorobenzene (CB), ii) to investigate the biogeochemical development of model wetlands treating intermediate dechlorination compounds, iii) to identify the prevailing degradation pathways within the investigated systems, and iv) to investigate the relationships between the microbial community and ambient hydrochemical conditions. The different investigations carried out in the framework of this thesis were based on an integrative approach, which couples Compound Specific Isotope Analysis (CSIA) to hydrogeochemical and molecular techniques. The various resulting sets of data were explored and linked by means of multivariate statistics in order to gain additional insights into the development of biogeochemical processes. First, recent progresses made towards understanding how mechanisms attributed to various organic chemicals removal interact to form a functioning treatment wetland were reviewed (Chapter 1, section 2). In particular, possible complementary techniques and integrative approaches to follow up in situ degradation processes were discussed. Second, the biogeochemical processes and the in situ biodegradation activity were characterized in two different model constructed wetland systems for contaminated groundwater-surface water interfaces (Chapter 2). In a first study (Chapter 2, section 1), the biotransformation of CB was investigated in a constructed wetland supplied with contaminated groundwater by means of a detailed geochemical characterization, stable isotope composition analysis and in situ microcosm systems loaded with 13 C-labelled CB. Significant shift in the isotopic composition of CB over the flow path under prevailing iron reducing conditions and the detection of 13 C-labelled benzene indicated reductive dehalogenation of CB. In a second study (Chapter 2, section 2), the spatial and temporal biogeochemical development of a model system loaded with cis - and trans - 1, 2 -dichloroethene contaminated groundwater was characterized over 430 days by means of hydrogeochemical and CSIA. The hydrogeochemistry dramatically changed over time from oxic to strongly reducing conditions, as emphasized by increasing concentrations of <b>ferrous</b> iron, <b>sulphide</b> and methane over time. In a complementary study (Chapter 2, section 3), the model wetland microbial community was characterized during the transition phase from a prevailing aerobic to an anaerobic regime. Non-metric dimensional scaling analysis of microbial fingerprints revealed that a dynamic community was associated with changes of redox-sensitive processes at the system scale. Microbial analyses emphasized the possible involvement of several microbial groups in the observed biogeochemical processes potentially influencing DCE transformation. The presence of a complex guild of putative dehalorespirers (Dehalobacter spp., Dehalococcoides spp. and Geobacter spp.) during the anoxic phase, where reductive dechlorination prevailed, was detected. 16 S rRNA gene libraries revealed substantial changes of the bacterial composition between the supplied groundwater and the model wetland pore water. Proteobacteria accounted for > 50 % of 16 S rRNA gene clone library of the wetland, and about 17 % of the sequences could be related to sulphate reducers. Overall, the investigation of the model system treating DCE contaminated groundwater i) demonstrated the linkage between the hydrogeochemical variability and the ongoing degradation processes, ii) highlighted the potential of CSIA to trace the temporal and spatial changes of the dominant degradation mechanism of DCE in natural or engineered systems, and iii) underscores progressive changes of both wetland microbial community structures and degrading guilds during the transition from mostly oxic to anoxic conditions that also coincided with changing degradation mechanism. The use of an integrated approach enabled monitoring in situ biodegradation of DCE and CB in model wetland systems, and to gather parallel information on the associated biogeochemical processes and prevailing contaminant transformation pathways. Third, in situ biodegradation of chlorinated solvents was studied in two different groundwater systems (Chapter 3). In a first study (Chapter 3, section 1), biodegradation of mostly recalcitrant chlorobenzenes was assessed at an anoxic aquifer by combining hydrogeochemical and stable isotope analyses. In situ microcosm analysis evidenced microbial assimilation of CB derived carbon, whereas laboratory investigations asserted mineralization of CB. An isotope balance was applied to overcome the limit of interpretation posed by the simultaneous enrichment and depletion in 13 C of reductive dechlorination intermediates during sequential in situ degradation. The enrichment obtained by cumulating the concentration and isotopic composition values of single chlorobenzene species indicated CB biodegradation at various zones of the aquifer. Additionally, the relationship between hydrogeochemical conditions and degradation activity was investigated by principal component analysis. This analysis underlines variable hydrogeochemical conditions associated with degradation activity at the plume scale. In a second study (Chapter 3, section 2), the ongoing in situ biodegradation of chlorinated ethenes within a hydrogeologically complex groundwater system (Bitterfeld, Germany) was investigated at the plume scale. The assessment of hydrogeochemical species and chlorinated ethenes concentrations distribution by principal component analysis (PCA), in combination with carbon stable isotope composition analysis, revealed that chlorinated ethenes were subjected to substantial biodegradation. Changes in isotopic composition values up to 20. 4, 13. 9, 20. 1 and 31. 4 ‰ were observed between geological units for tetrachloroethene (PCE), trichloroethene (TCE), cis -dichloroethene (cDCE) and vinyl chloride (VC), respectively. The use of specific biomarkers (16 S rRNA gene) indicated the presence of Dehalococcoides sp. DNA in 20 of the 33 evaluated samples. Analysis of bacterial community structures variation in the aquifers using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated a predominant influence of the contaminant concentrations. To gain additional knowledge on biogeochemical variability within this groundwater system, a third study assessed the bacterial community structures, hydrogeochemical indicators and the carbon stable isotope composition of chlorinated ethenes at discrete-depth intervals along a hydrogeologically heterogeneous vertical profile (Chapter 3, section 3). Substantial variation of the hydrogeochemistry, bacterial community structures and the distribution of putative dehalorespirers (Dehalobacter spp., Desulfitobacterium spp., Dehalococcoides spp. or Geobacter spp.) were observed with depth, according to the contaminant concentration. The compound specific isotope analysis of the single chlorinated ethenes species was interpreted globally based on an isotope balance. Hydrogeochemical and microbiological indicators as well as the isotope balance, revealing isotopic enrichment above 8 ‰ between the sources and the plume fringe area, clearly demonstrated the occurrence of reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes at the investigated depths. Isotope balance values revealed enrichment from - 14. 4 to - 4. 4 ‰ over the vertical profile, which suggested that chlorinated ethenes biodegradation reaction varied spatially. Overall, a relationship could be established between bacterial community structures, hydrogeochemical variables and hydrogeological conditions. In summary, the different investigations presented in this thesis underscored the relevance of conducting integrative studies based on several, complementary techniques to improve the assessment of relevant chlorinated solvents in situ biogeochemical processes in complex systems. In order to facilitate the exploration and interpretation of the relationships between subsurface biocenoses and biogeochemical contaminant removal processes, complex microbial and hydrochemical sets of data can be efficiently treated by multivariate analysis. Several concepts related to the isotopic analysis of chlorinated solvents developed and applied in the framework of this thesis (i. e. the elucidation of DCE degradation pathways, the isotope balance and the use of in situ microcosms experiments) may be adapted and employed for further investigation of the environmental fate of chlorinated solvents as well as for other organic chemicals. Furthermore, the investigation demonstrated that concepts and approaches currently being applied in groundwater systems for assessing in situ biodegradation and elucidating degradation pathways of chlorinated solvents can be efficiently transposed to monitor and study organic chemicals in hydrologically and hydrochemically heterogeneous wetland systems...|$|R
40|$|Metal {{and energy}} {{extractive}} industries play a strategic {{role in the}} economic development of Sweden. At the same time these industries present {{a major threat to}} the environment due to multidimensional environmental pollution produced in the course of ageing of ore processing tailings and waste rocks. In the context of valuable sulphide mineral recovery from sulphide ore, the complex chemistry of the sulphide surface reactions in a pulp, coupled with surface oxidation and instability of the adsorbed species, makes the adsorption processes and selective flotation of a given sulphide mineral from other sulphides have always been problematic and scientifically a great challenge. Invariably, the problems associated with acid mine drainage and selectivity in flotation are explained {{to be associated with the}} oxidation of metal sulphides. Although metal sulphides oxidation and galvanic effects were well known in flotation and leaching of sulphides, recent studies reveal the formation of reactive, oxidizing oxygen species and H 2 O 2 by sulphides due to the catalytic activity of sulphide surfaces. The inherent formation of H 2 O 2 by single and mixture of sulphide minerals during wet and dry grinding systems and in open and closed environments have been investigated. It was found that pyrite (FeS 2), chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2), sphalerite ((Zn,Fe) S), and galena (PbS) generated H 2 O 2 in pulp liquid during wet grinding in the presence and absence of dissolved oxygen in water and also when the freshly dry ground solids are placed in water immediately after grinding. Pyrite generated more H 2 O 2 than other sulphide minerals and the order of H 2 O 2 production by the minerals found to be pyrite > chalcopyrite > sphalerite > galena. The pH of water influenced the extent of hydrogen peroxide formation where higher amounts of H 2 O 2 are produced at highly acidic pH. The amount of H 2 O 2 formed also increased with increasing sulphide mineral loading and grinding time due to increased surface area and its interaction with water. The sulphide surfaces are highly catalytically active and capable of breaking down the water molecule leading to hydroxyl free radicals. Type of grinding medium on formation of hydrogen peroxide by pyrite and galena revealed that the mild steel produced more H 2 O 2 than stainless steel grinding medium, where Fe 2 + and/or Fe 3 + ions played a key role in producing higher amounts of H 2 O 2. In addition, the effect of mixed sulphide minerals, i. e., pyrite–chalcopyrite, pyrite–galena, chalcopyrite–galena and sphalerite–pyrite, sphalerite–chalcopyrite and sphalerite–galena on the formation of H 2 O 2 showed increasing H 2 O 2 formation with increasing the content of a nobler mineral or higher rest potential mineral in a mixed composition. The results of H 2 O 2 formation in pulp liquid of sulphide minerals and mixed minerals at different experimental conditions have been explained by Eh–pH diagrams of these minerals and the existence of free metal ions that are equally responsible for H 2 O 2 formation besides surfaces catalytic activity. The results also corroborate the amount of H 2 O 2 production with the rest potential of the sulphide minerals; higher is the rest potential more is the formation of H 2 O 2. Most likely H 2 O 2 is answerable for the oxidation of sulphide minerals and dissolution of non-ferrous metal sulphides in the presence of <b>ferrous</b> <b>sulphide</b> besides the galvanic interactions. Studies have also been carried out to build correlation between percentage of pyrite in the concentrate, grinding conditions and concentration of OH•/H 2 O 2 in the pulp and as well of controlling the formation of these species through known chemical means for depressing the generation of the oxidant. Flotation tests using a complex sulphide ore with the same reagent scheme that is being used at Boliden concentrator but with the addition of collector and depressant during grinding stage have been performed to judge the beneficial or detrimental role of H 2 O 2 on the selective flotation of sulphides. The results demonstrate that the selectivity of metal sulphides against pyrite increases with increasing generation of H 2 O 2 in the pulp liquid. This study highlights the necessity of revisiting into the electrochemical and/or galvanic interactions between the grinding medium and sulphide minerals, and interaction mechanisms between pyrite and other sulphide minerals in terms of their flotation behaviour, leaching and environmental degradation in the context of inevitable H 2 O 2 existence in the pulp liquid.
