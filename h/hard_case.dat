Additional gear that is acceptable though subject to individual team rules include padded knee length pants, similar to what aggressive skateboarders wear, and biologically specific gear such as a <b>hard</b> <b>case</b> sports bra for female players and protective cups for males.|$|E

40|$|Courts {{interpret}} statutes in <b>hard</b> <b>cases.</b> Statutes {{are frequently}} ambiguous, and an enacting legislature cannot foresee all future applications of a statute. The Supreme Court {{in these cases}} often chooses statutory interpretations that privilege the values that it has emphasized in its recent constitutional jurisprudence. In doing so, the Court rejects alternative interpretations that are more consistent with the values embodied in more recently enacted statutes. This is constitutional mainstreaming—an interpretive practice that molds statutes toward the Court 2 ̆ 7 s own preferred values and away from values favored by legislative majorities. In addition to providing a novel descriptive framework for what the Court is doing in these <b>hard</b> <b>cases,</b> this Article offers two normative contributions. The first is a critique of constitutional mainstreaming. Challenging the prevailing view that constitutional norms should have primary influence on the interpretation of statutes in <b>hard</b> <b>cases,</b> I argue that the Court should not engage in constitutional mainstreaming because it implicitly undermines a central principle of statutory interpretation: legislative supremacy. The Article 2 ̆ 7 s second normative contribution is an alternative to constitutional mainstreaming. I suggest that in <b>hard</b> <b>cases</b> the Court should prioritize the values reflected in more recently enacted statutes rather than the values emphasized in its own constitutional jurisprudence. These evolving statute-based values {{are more likely to}} reflect evolving democratic preferences than are judicially emphasized constitutional norms...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores {{whether the}} three {{standard}} value relations, “better than”, “worse than” and “equally as good”, exhaust the possibilities in which things can relate {{with respect to}} their value. Or more precisely, whether there are examples in which one of these relations is not instantiated. There are cases in which it is not obvious that one of these relations does obtain; these are referred to as “hard cases of comparison”. These <b>hard</b> <b>cases</b> of comparison become interesting, since if it not the case that the standard three value relations obtains in these cases then the three standard relations do not exhaust the possibility of instantiated value relations. It is argued that for some of the <b>hard</b> <b>cases</b> of comparison, the standard relations determinately obtain. For some it is indeterminate, due to vagueness, which of the three relations obtains, but it is determinate that one of them obtains. Thereafter it is argued that the influential Collapsing Argument fails in ruling out other accounts of the <b>hard</b> <b>cases</b> of comparison. Since one cannot depend on the Collapsing Argument in order to conclude that all items are related by the standard three relations, the investigation continues. It is argued that none of the <b>hard</b> <b>cases</b> of comparison are cases of incomparability. Furthermore, none of them are cases of a fourth basic positive value relation such as “parity”. Consequently, for all the <b>hard</b> <b>cases</b> of comparison one of the standard value relations holds, although sometimes we do not know which one and sometimes it is indeterminate which one holds. This means that {{there is no reason to}} assume that one of the standard three value relations does not hold between items we are comparing. This is followed by a brief discussion about the normative consequences of this result. The thesis ends with four different appendices in which related topics are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Without a {{religious}} justification in the law, judges cannot fully justify their decisions in <b>hard</b> <b>cases</b> {{from within the}} law. The law must be indeterminate because the Establishment Clause proscribes this full justification. This {{does not mean that}} the Establishment Clause prohibits judges from fully justifying their decisions during their deliberations about <b>hard</b> <b>cases.</b> It only prohibits judges from including that full justification in their written opinions. Deliberation and explanation are separate stages of judicial decision making that should be kept distinct. Given this distinction, my thesis is that judges should fully justify their decisions in <b>hard</b> <b>cases</b> by relying on their religious or comprehensive convictions in their deliberation (religionist deliberation) but that judges 2 ̆ 7 religious convictions should only implicitly inform the legal explanation of their decision in their written opinions (separationist explanation). I refer to this as the religionist-separationist model of judicial decision making which maintains that religious convictions are the 2 ̆ 2 silent prologue 2 ̆ 2 to any full justification of the law...|$|R
