40|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} quantification methods for gluten in food {{are necessary to}} ensure proper product labelling and thus safeguard the gluten sensitive consumer against exposure. <b>Immunochemical</b> <b>detection</b> is the method of choice, as it is sensitive, rapid and relatively easy to use. Although {{a wide range of}} detection kits are commercially available, there are still many difficulties in gluten detection that have not yet been overcome. This review gives an overview of the currently commercially available <b>immunochemical</b> <b>detection</b> methods, and discusses the problems that still exist in gluten detection in food. The largest problems are encountered in the extraction of gluten from food matrices, the choice of epitopes targeted by the detection method, and the use of a standardized reference material. By comparing the available techniques with the unmet needs in gluten detection, the possible benefit of a new multiplex immunoassay is investigated. This detection method would allow for the detection and quantification of multiple harmful gluten peptides at once and would, therefore, be a logical advancement in gluten detection in food...|$|E

40|$|During progesterone-induced {{maturation}} of Xenopus oocytes, {{the transport}} and ouabain binding capacity of Na(+) -K(+) -ATPase at the plasma membrane is completely downregulated. To elucidate the mechanism and the physiological {{significance of this}} process, we have followed the fate of oocyte alpha-beta 3 -Na(+) -K(+) -ATPase complexes during meiotic maturation and early embryonic development. An immunocytochemical follow-up of the catalytic alpha-subunit, ouabain binding studies, cell surface iodination, and oocyte cell fractionation combined with <b>immunochemical</b> subunit <b>detection</b> provides evidence that following progesterone treatment Na(+) -K(+) -ATPase molecules are retrieved from the oocyte plasma membrane. The enzyme complexes are recovered in an active form in an intracellular compartment in both in vitro and in vivo matured eggs. Exogenous Xenopus alpha 1 - and beta 1 -complexes expressed in the oocyte from injected cRNAs are regulated by progesterone similar to endogenous Na(+) -K(+) -ATPase complexes. Finally, active Na(+) -K+ pumps internalized during oocyte maturation appear to be redistributed to plasma membrane fractions during blastula formation in Xenopus embryos. In conclusion, our data suggest that endocytosis of alpha 1 - and beta 3 -complexes during meiotic maturation of Xenopus oocytes is responsible for downregulation of Na(+) -K(+) -ATPase activity and results in an intracellular pool of functional enzymes, which might be reexpressed during early development in response to physiological needs...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcal food {{poisoning}} {{is caused by}} ingestion of enterotoxins which are excreted into foods by some strains of coagulase positive staphylococci, mainly Staphylococcus aureus. To protect consumers, Commission Regulation 1441 / 2007 specifies thresholds {{for the presence of}} these toxins in foods such as cheeses. In addition, the reference method to be applied for detection is defined (extraction, dialysis concentration, <b>immunochemical</b> toxin <b>detection).</b> In order to enforce legislation, it is indispensable to have suitable quality assurance tools such as reference materials (RMs) available to implement and safeguard reliable measurements. Anses and IRMM collaborate to develop a RM for Staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) in cheese. First a feasibility study was conducted to establish a suitable processing procedure for producing large quantities of homogeneous and stable cheese powders. Three types of materials were made, and the following one proved to be most suitable: the blank material was prepared by cutting, grinding, freeze-drying, milling and mixing. For the spiked material, the cheese was converted into a slurry, spiked with a solution of SEA, freeze-dried, mixed, and diluted with blank material to the target SEA concentration level. Thereafter, large batches of three materials (blank, very low contaminated, low contaminated) were processed, and the materials' homogeneity and short-term stability were assessed using the reference method. The materials showed to be sufficiently homogeneous for the intended used, and storage at + 18 ºC for 4 weeks did not indicate any detectable material degradation.

Reactive nitrating species have specifically been implicated in AD based on <b>immunochemical</b> and instrumental <b>detection</b> of nitrotyrosine in AD brain protein. The significance of lipid-phase nitration has not been investigated in AD. This study documents a significant two- to threefold increase in the lipid nitration product 5 -nitro-gamma-tocopherol in affected regions of the AD brain as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. In a bioassay to compare the relative potency of alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol against nitrative stress, rat brain mitochondria {{were exposed to the}} peroxynitrite-generating compound SIN- 1. The oxidation-sensitive Kreb's cycle enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase was inactivated by SIN- 1, in a manner that could be significantly attenuated by gamma-tocopherol (at < 10 microM) but not by alpha-tocopherol.

Oxidative {{modification of}} total cellular proteins has been described under many pathologic and experimental conditions, but no specific proteins have been identified as in vivo targets for oxidative modification. Utilizing an <b>immunochemical</b> method for <b>detection</b> of oxidatively modified proteins, we identified a protein in rat liver that was highly oxidized.

Carbonic anhydrase III was purified from rats aged 2, 10, and 18 months, and the proteins were characterized. All three preparations were highly oxidatively modified as assessed by their carbonyl content. The enzyme has three known catalytic activities, and the specific activities for carbon dioxide hydration and for ester hydrolysis decreased during aging by Graphic 30 %. However, the third activity, that of a phosphatase, was virtually lost during aging.

We aimed {{to estimate the}} sensitivity and specificity of CTC for colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps following positive FOBt via systematic review. Methods: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED and Cochrane Library databases were searched for CTC studies reporting sensitivity and specificity for colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps. Included subjects had tested FOBt-positive by guaiac or <b>immunochemical</b> methods. Per-patient <b>detection</b> rates were summarized via forest plots. Meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity was conducted using a bivariate random effects model and the average operating point calculated. Results: Of 538 articles considered, 5 met inclusion criteria, describing results from 622 patients. Research study quality was good. CTC had a high per-patient average sensitivity of 88. 8 % (95 % CI 83. 6 to 92. 5 %) for ≥ 6 mm adenomas or colorectal cancer, with low between-study heterogeneity. Specificity was both more heterogeneous and lower, {{at an average of}} 75. 4 % (95 % CI 58. 6 to 86. 8 %). Conclusion: Few studies have investigated CTC in FOBt-positive individuals. CTC is sensitive at a ≥ 6 mm threshold but specificity is lower and variable. Despite the limited data, these results suggest that CTC may adequately substitute for colonoscopy when the latter is undesirable. Key Points: • FOBt is the most common mass screening test for colorectal cancer. • Few studies evaluate CT colonography after positive FOBt. • CTC is approximately 89 % sensitive for ≥ 6 mm adenomas/cancer in this setting. • Specificity is lower, at approximately 75 %, and more variable. • CT colonography is a good alternative when colonoscopy is undesirable. © 2014 European Society of Radiology...|$|R

However the number of relapses remains high, caused by persistence of residual tumor cells, i. e., the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD). One of the methods for MRD study is multicolor flow cytometry (MFC) where abnormal expression of surface antigens on myeloma plasma cells (PC) is determined. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} the MRD by MFC before and after ASCT, the {{frequency of}} MRD-negative status achievement in complete remission (CR) patients at + 100 days after ASCT and the frequency of abnormal expressed antigens on myeloma plasma cells. The study included 40 MMpatients in CR at + 100 days after ASCT and showed that the most common aberrations of PC were: abnormal absence of CD 19 and/or CD 27, decreased expression of CD 38 and abnormal presence of CD 56. The proportion of myeloma PCs from all bone marrow cells decreased significantly after ASCT: 20 % of patients acquired MRD-negative status, 10 % had a {{decrease in the number of}} abnormal PCs by one fold.

An indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for 2, 4, 5 -TCP has been developed after a rational design of the immunizing hapten chemical structure, and the screening of 12 competitor haptens. The effect of the conjugation degree of the competitors and their homology with the target analyte, the physicochemical parameters (pH, ionic strength), the concentration of detergent, the time of incubation and the specificity were studied. Two immunoassays (2, 4, 5 - and 2, 4, 6 -TCP ELISAs) were evaluated {{for the analysis of}} water, milk, serum and urine. Drinking water was analyzed directly after buffering the sample. The strong matrix effects in milk samples requires the sample clean up. Human serum can be analyzed after protein precipitation with absolute ethanol. The strong matrix effect of urine and its variability for samples from different individuals suggested the introduction of a purification step prior to ELISA. The C 18 - solid phase extraction (SPE) is an effective clean up method to remove {{an important part of the}} nonspecific interferences present in urine. The C 18 -SPE-ELISA method allows accurate quantification of TCPs in urine of occupationally exposed persons. SPE based on immunosorbents (immunoaffinity extraction, IAE) have been developed in single and 96 -column formats. IAE is an effective clean up method to remove all nonspecific urinary interferences. The IAE step was optimized regarding sample volume, loading level, type of urine hydrolysis washing and elution conditions. The selectivity of the immunosorbents can be modulated by the washing conditions. The immunosorbents have sufficient capacity to effectively extract 2, 4, 6 -TCP from urine samples of occupationally exposed persons and the general population. The HTS-IAE-ELISA method allows the processing of 100 samples/day with very good precision and accuracy. The method was validated with GC-MS and applied to the biomonitoring of three groups of population from Catalonia. A quenching fluorescence immunoassay based on the laser-induced fluorescence detection in microdroplets (LIF-microdroplet-QFIA) for 2, 4, 6 -TCP has been developed as a novel biodetection system.

40|$|The {{blood brain barrier}} (BBB) is {{the site}} of {{exchange}} between blood and the nervous tissue. Damage of it may impair physiological balance between blood stream and nervous tissue. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is defined by several interconnected physiological, biochemical, and metabolic factors directly related to obesity. It increases the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease and of all cause mortality. Obese Zucker rats (OZRs), with a mutation in leptin receptor, represent a model of obesity exhibiting diabetes and moderate arterial hypertension. In OZRs hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and hyperlipidaemia occur simultaneously. This work had characterized BBB and endothelial alterations of OZRs compared to their non-obese cohort lean Zucker rats (LZRs) for assessing the occurrence of an eventual cerebrovascular injury. Brains of male OZRs and LZRs of 12, 16 and 20 weeks were processed for the <b>immunochemical</b> and immunohistochemical <b>detection</b> of different BBB markers. The water channel protein Aquaporin- 4 (AQP 4) and the glucose transporter protein- 1 (GLUT 1) involved in the glucose passage across the BBB endothelial cells were investigated. The expression of adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM- 1) and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 (PECAM- 1) was also assessed within cerebrovascular endothelium as a marker of inflammation. In intracerebral arteries of older OZRs, a decrease of lumen area with an increase of wall area was found. BBB of older OZRs revealed an augmented expression of AQP 4 probably related to an edema formation. A downregulation of GLUT 1 was observed in OZRs of 12 weeks of age. This may represent the adaptive reaction to prevent excessive glucose entering in neurons. On the contrary, in older OZRs an obvious increase in the expression of GLUT 1 was found. These phenomena are probably related to vascular inflammation as confirmed by the increase of ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 expression in the endothelium of older OZRs. The above evidence shows that OZRs develope specific BBB changes. This could contribute to clarify the pathophysiology of nervous system damage reported in obese individuals.

To determine the role of vascular homeostasis disorders regulation in the event of pregnancy complications in liver disorders in the study group allocated 2 groups: 1 st — 19 women with essential obstetric and perinatal disorders (abortions and missed abortion, preeclampsia, severe, decompensated fetal distress), 2 nd — 31 women without such disorders. It was found that pregnancy after ART programs held for particularly severe complications in women with hepatobiliary pathology, who already at the beginning of pregnancy, the formation and development of the placenta takes place under conditions of endothelial dysfunction (reduction of L-arginine to 39. 8 ± 2. 0 versus 45. 8 ± 1. 6 mmol/l in women without significant violations of gestation, p< 0. 05), the negative impact of homocysteine (an increase to 7. 4 ± 0. 44 versus 6. 4 ± 0. 36 mmol/l, p< 0. 05), violations of angiogenesis (PlGF decrease in blood to 70. 5 ± 11. 9 versus 103. 7 ± 9. 8 pg/ml, p< 0. 05). Consequently, these factors may be early prognostic markers of severe obstetric and perinatal disorders during induced pregnancy in women with hepatobiliary disorders. Conclusions.

The selectivity of the immunosorbents can be modulated by the washing conditions. The immunosorbents have sufficient capacity to effectively extract 2, 4, 6 -TCP from urine samples of occupationally exposed persons and the general population. The HTS-IAE-ELISA method allows the processing of 100 samples/day with very good precision and accuracy. The method was validated with GC-MS and applied to the biomonitoring of three groups of population from Catalonia. A quenching fluorescence immunoassay based on the laser-induced fluorescence detection in microdroplets (LIF-microdroplet-QFIA) for 2, 4, 6 -TCP has been developed as a novel biodetection system. This approach offers significant improvement in method detectability compared to the microplate immunoassays and is the first application urine samples that can be directly analyzed after sample dilution.

40|$|International audienceAim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the extent of pollution in the West Black Sea Coast of Turkey by measuring CYP 1 A associated EROD activity, phase II enzyme, glutathione S-transferase and antioxidant enzymes, catalase and glutathione reductase activities and <b>immunochemical</b> <b>detection</b> of CYP 1 A protein level in the liver of mullet. The fish samples were caught from six locations having a varying degree of pollution in the West Black Sea Region of Turkey in August 2005, 2006 and 2007. Mullets caught from Zonguldak Harbour, Ereğli Harbour and Gülüç Stream's Mouth displayed 6 - 9 fold higher EROD, 2 - 4 fold higher glutathione S-transferase and 2 - 3 fold higher catalase activities than the reference site, Amasra. Total polyaromatic hydrocarbon levels in mullets caught from these locations were also significantly higher (2 - 4 fold) than Amasra. The results {{of this study}} indicate that Zonguldak Harbour, Ereğli Harbour and Gülüç Stream are highly polluted by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and related contaminants...|$|E
40|$|Prion {{diseases}} are usually diagnosed clinically and confirmed by post-mortem histopathological examination of brain tissue. The only reliable molecular marker for prion diseases is PrPSc, the pathological conformer of the prion protein that accumulates {{in the central}} nervous system and, to a lesser extent, in lymphoreticular tissues. For BSE, several commercial diagnostic kits based on the post-mortem <b>immunochemical</b> <b>detection</b> of PrPSc in brain tissue are now available. These rapid screening tests have been used in active surveillance of BSE and have greatly improved the detection of infected cattle before their entry into the human food chain. At present, no diagnostic test exists for the detection of prion diseases in live animals or humans. New diagnostic techniques aimed at increasing sensitivity and specificity of PrPSc detection in body fluids and at identifying novel surrogate markers are under development. In this report, we review the classical diagnostic methods as well as present and future tools for the diagnosis of prion diseases. Overview of TSE diagnosi...|$|E
40|$|Pigments {{homologous}} to {{the green}} fluorescent protein (GFP) contribute up to 14 % of the soluble protein content of many anthozoans. Maintenance of such high tissue levels poses a severe energetic penalty to the animals if protein turnover is fast. To address this as yet unexplored issue, we established that the irreversible green-to-red conversion of the GFP-like pigments from the reef corals Montastrea cavernosa (mcavRFP) and Lobophyllia hemprichii (EosFP) is driven by violet–blue radiation in vivo and in situ. In the absence of photoconverting light, we subsequently tracked degradation of the red-converted forms of the two proteins in coral tissue using in vivo spectroscopy and <b>immunochemical</b> <b>detection</b> of the post-translational peptide backbone modification. The pigments displayed surprisingly slow decay rates, characterized by half-lives of 20 days. The slow turnover of GFP-like proteins implies that the associated energetic costs for being colorful are comparatively low. Moreover, high in vivo stability makes GFP-like proteins suitable for functions requiring high pigment concentrations, such as photoprotection...|$|E
40|$|Biacore biosensors (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) {{have proven}} to be robust {{analytical}} tools for the automated <b>immunochemical</b> <b>detection</b> of different adulterants and contaminants in milk and milk powder. However, the significant cost of the instruments is a disincentive for their wide application in food control laboratories. Therefore, a low-cost alternative optical biosensor (Spreeta¿, Texas Instruments, Attleboro, MA) was built into an affordable liquid handling system. Using this prototype biosensor, an inhibition immunoassay for bovine ¿-casein was evaluated for the detection of cow's milk in ewe's and goat's milk and for the detection of bovine rennet whey powder in milk powder. Comparable sensitivities were obtained for both adulterants in the Spreeta-based prototype biosensor and a Biacore 3000 instrument. The limit of detection for cow's milk was 0. 17 % (v/v) and bovine rennet whey powder could be detected in milk powder above 1 % (w/w). The Spreeta sensor was also useful in the control of fraudulent water additions to milk, simply by measuring differences in the bulk respons...|$|E
40|$|As part of {{a program}} to develop methods for {{diagnosis}} of exposure to chemical warfare agents, we developed immunochemical methods for detection of adducts of sulfur mustard to keratin in human skin. Three partial sequences of keratins containing glutamine or asparagine adducted with a 2 -hydroxyethylthioethyl group at the ω-amide function were synthesized and used as antigens for raising antibodies. After immunization, monoclonal antibodies were obtained with affinity for keratin isolated from human callus exposed to 50 μM sulfur mustard. These antibodies showed binding to the stratum corneum of human skin exposed to low levels of sulfur mustard, as evidenced by immunofluorescence microscopy. This approach opens the way for development of a detection kit {{that can be applied}} directly to the skin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of <b>immunochemical</b> <b>detection</b> of adduct formation of toxic chemicals with skin proteins. A similar approach can be followed for skin exposure to environmental pollutants...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe cDNAs {{for the two}} {{variable}} {{domains of}} the antibody 9 E 10 were cloned from the hybridoma cell line. A chimeric 9 E 10 Fab fragment was produced in E. coli under control of the tightly controlled tetracycline promoter. The functional Fab fragment was isolated in a single step via a His 6 -tag, which also served for its recognition by a nickel chelate-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Thus, the recombinant Fab fragment permitted the <b>immunochemical</b> <b>detection</b> of the myc tag in a sandwich ELISA. The dissociation constant for the interaction with the myc tag peptide was determined as 80 ± 5 nM by fluorescence titration. In an attempt to produce the smaller 9 E 10 Fv fragment {{it was found that}} its VH domain alone can be readily isolated from E. coli as a soluble protein. This unusual behaviour may be explained by the 18 amino acid-long CDR-H 3 and could be of value in the design of `single domain' antibodies...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} is to develop improved antibody-based methods for detection of multiple polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), to fill several needs in DOE's remediation, regulatory monitoring, ecotoxicology, and human health effects missions. Present-generation <b>immunochemical</b> <b>detection</b> methods have already proven to be useful and cost-effective in DOE applications. The problem being addressed is that the unique properties of PAHs make it impractical to generate antibodies with the required diversity, specificity and selectivity, by the previous techniques. The scientific goals are to determine the mechanisms by which antibodies bind PAHs, use genetic engineering and computational chemistry techniques to construct improved antibodies, and to devise methods for making immunochemical and instrumental analysis more compatible. The potential relevance is that our results should provide a rational basis by which immunochemical and other molecular recognition systems for PAHs and other large classes of toxic pollutants such as PCBs could be produced and deployed with substantially less cost, labor, and development time...|$|E
