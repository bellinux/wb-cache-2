50|$|For these reasons, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a United Nations agency {{specializing in}} safety of {{shipping}} and preventing ships from polluting the seas, began looking at ways of improving maritime distress and safety communications. In 1979, {{a group of}} experts drafted the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, which called for development of a global search and rescue plan. This group also passed a resolution calling for development by IMO of a Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) to provide the communication support needed to implement the search and rescue plan. This new system, which the world's maritime nations are implementing, is based upon a combination of satellite and terrestrial radio services, and has changed international <b>distress</b> <b>communications</b> from being primarily ship-to-ship based to ship-to-shore (Rescue Coordination Center) based. It spelled the end of Morse code communications for {{all but a few}} users, such as amateur radio operators. The GMDSS provides for automatic distress alerting and locating in cases where a radio operator doesn't have time to send an SOS or MAYDAY call, and, for the first time, requires ships to receive broadcasts of maritime safety information which could prevent a distress from happening in the first place. In 1988, IMO amended the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention, requiring ships subject to it fit GMDSS equipment. Such ships were required to carry NAVTEX and satellite EPIRBs by August 1, 1993, and had to fit all other GMDSS equipment by February 1, 1999. US ships were allowed to fit GMDSS in lieu of Morse telegraphy equipment by the Telecommunications Act of 1996.|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 22 - 25, 1984 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaFor {{maritime}} {{applications of}} <b>distress</b> <b>communications</b> via geostationary satellites a special method of signal processing was developed, called superposition technique. The data frame containing the alert message {{is transmitted from}} a distress equipment repeatedly. After being relayed by the satellite the signal is detected and improved by superimposing the frames. Around 14 dB is the actual processing gain. Thus a distress buoy is able to transfer a message {{from all over the}} world with high reliability by only transmitting a power of 50 mW omnidirectionally over a slant range of about 40 000 km. The described system, called the Distress Radio Call System (DRCS) was tested in a Coordinated Trials Program (CTP) of 6 nations. Both in a simulation phase and in a field test under exactly the same environmental conditions the DRCS with its superposition technique was able to detect signals with lowest signal-to-noise-density ratio without error. In laboratory tests using GAUSS channel conditions, a system threshold of 13 dB-Hz could be demonstrated. In a real environment (North Cape) 15 dB-Hz was the lower limit for error-free reception. CCIR approved a recommendation in June, 1984 for a system operating through geostationary satellites at 1. 6 GHz being a DRCS-type with very little modifications...|$|E
40|$|Aim. Undergoing {{genetic testing}} {{for breast cancer}} risk can be {{stressful}} {{and women who have}} testing frequently rely on their spouses for support. Unfortunately support partners often experience considerable distress themselves, feeling under-informed about the genetic testing process and unsure about how best to support the woman concerned. In this study we describe the development of a theoretically-driven web-based information and support resource for male support partners of women undergoing genetic testing. Method: Development of the Supporting Men, Supporting Women website entailed: 1) A needs analysis by interviewing genetics health professionals and male support partners; 2) Module and content development informed by theory, the needs analysis and expert consultation; 3) Video-recording and editing of interviews depicting experiences of male support partners and modelled stress management techniques; 4) Website ‘look-and-feel’ piloting; and, 5) Final website production. Results: Interviews with health professionals and support partners highlighted the need for a resource to provide men with information about the genetic testing process as well as guidance on managing their own and the woman’s <b>distress,</b> and improving <b>communications</b> with the tested woman. Website modules developed for this resource reflect information about these topics, as well as descriptions of typical reactions of women and their spouses to the testing process, and guidance to enhance coping and communication. Additionally, videotaped interviews depicting the experiences of spouses who have supported women through genetic testing were included. Conclusion: Supporting Men, Supporting Women is the first resource to specifically target the support needs of partners of women undergoing genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility. By providing an accessible web-based supportive resource for male partners, this resource is likely to provide benefits both to supportive spouses, as well as the tested women themselves. The efficacy of this web-based resource will be assessed in a randomised controlled trial. 2 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|International {{refinements}} {{for the use}} of 500 kHz were {{specified in}} later agreements, including the 1932 Madrid Radio Conference. In later years, except for distress traffic, stations shifted to nearby [...] "working frequencies" [...] to exchange messages once contact was established. 425, 454, 468, 480, and 512 kHz were used by ships while the coast stations had their own individual working frequencies. Twice each hour, all stations operating on 500 kHz were required to maintain a strictly enforced three-minute silent period, starting at 15 and 45 minutes past the hour.As a visual memory aid, a typical clock in a ship's radio room would have the silence periods marked by shading the sectors between h+15 to h+18 and h+45 to h+48 in RED. Similar sectors between h+00 to H+03 and h+30 to h+33 are marked in GREEN which is the corresponding silence period for the 2182 kHz voice <b>communications</b> <b>distress</b> signals. In addition, during this silent period all coastal and ship stations were required to monitor the frequency, listening for any distress signals. All large ships at sea had to monitor 500 kHz at all times, either with a licensed radio operator or with equipment that automatically detected an SOS alarm signal. [...] Shore stations throughout the world operated on this frequency to exchange messages with ships and to issue warning about weather and other navigational warnings. At night, transmission ranges of 3,000-4,000 miles (4,500-6,500 kilometers) were typical. Daytime ranges were much shorter, on the order of 300-1500 miles (500-2,500 kilometers). Terman's Radio Engineering Handbook (1948) shows the maximum distance for 1 kW over salt water to be 1,500 miles, and this distance was routinely covered by ships at sea, where signals from ships and nearby coastal stations would cause congestion, covering up distant and weaker signals. During the silence, a distress signal could more easily be heard at great distances.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{variations in}} corporate fiduciary duties arising from financial distress. This paper argues {{whether there is}} an affirmatively enforceable duty under the principles of Credit Lyonnais is not moot, because, inter alia, the availability of aiding and abetting liability for breach of fiduciary duty will give rise to a greater set of potentially liable defendants (aiding and abetting a fraudulent transfer typically not separately giving rise to liability), allowing a court to reverse some outcomes that would otherwise obtain under the in pari delicto doctrine and the Wagoner rule, and will expand the remedies available. This paper argues application of the business judgment rule to directors 2 ̆ 7 operation of a distressed firm should be, if anything, stronger than the corresponding provision applied to a solvent firm. The rationale is that a contrary right would create an anomalous option for creditors having expressly negotiated approval rights - one that would be difficult to value and that would create greater costs of investigation in order to avoid being a winner in a contest presenting a winner 2 ̆ 7 s curse. This paper also examines the interplay of distress with approval of conflict of interest and final period transactions. It concludes that during distress short of insolvency, fiduciary duties to maximize firm value on a sale should continue to be owed to stockholders, and that approval of conflict-of-interest transactions by disinterested stockholders should continue to shift the burden of proof as to transaction fairness. Lastly, this paper argues for an increase in the duty of candor, following Malone v. Brincat, during <b>distress</b> appertaining to <b>communications</b> to creditors. Financial creditors will consider information a debtor provides in deciding whether to exercise contractually negotiated control rights. Creditors should be entitled to rely on truthfulness even if the debtor is unaware of a particular action the creditor may take in reliance. As proposed, a creditor would not need to prove a distressed debtor made a statement for purposes of influencing the creditor 2 ̆ 7 s conduct because financial creditors may be presumed to be deciding whether to exercise remedies on an ongoing basis. Other elements of a cause of action, e. g., whether a defendant failed to exercise the appropriate care in assuring the accuracy of the statement, would remain unchanged.
