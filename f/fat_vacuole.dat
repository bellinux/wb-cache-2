We report a case of FRG in the bone marrow biopsy of a 45 -year old male with pancytopenia and clinical features of sepsis and bleeding diathesis. Serologically, the antibodies against Orientia tsutsugamushi were positive; being diagnostic of scrub typhus. The patient responded to specific antibiotics and supportive treatment. Thus, scrub typhus should be included as aetiology for FRG. Index Terms- Fibrin-ring granuloma (FRG); scrub typhus; bone marrow biopsy, sepsis. F I...|$|E
40|$|Background. Obesity {{is often}} {{associated}} with increased biliary cholesterol secretion resulting in cholesterol gallstone formation. We have previously demonstrated that leptin-deficient C 57 Bl/ 6 J Lep ob obese mice have abnormal biliary motility and are prone to cholesterol crystal formation. In addition, others have demonstrated that leptin-deficient mice when fed a lithogenic diet for eight weeks are not prone to gallstone formation. However, the biliary lipid and in vivo cholesterol crystal response of homozygous and heterozygous leptin-deficient mice to four weeks on a lithogenic diet has not been studied. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that lithogenic diets influence gallbladder bile composition, serum lipids and cholesterol crystal formation in homozygous and heterozygous leptin-deficient mice compared to normal lean controls. Methods. 319 female lean control mice, 280 heterozygous lep ob obese mice and 117 homozygous lep ob obese mice were studied. Mice were fed either a lithogenic or control non-lithogenic chow diet for four weeks. Gallbladder volumes were measured, and bile was pooled to calculate cholesterol saturation indices. Serum cholesterol, glucose, and leptin levels were determined. Hepatic fat vacuoles were counted, and bile was observed microscopically for cholesterol crystal formation. Results. The lithogenic diet and mouse strain influenced body and liver weights, gallbladder volume, cholesterol crystal formation, serum cholesterol, glucose and leptin levels and hepatic <b>fat</b> <b>vacuole</b> numbers. However, only diet, not strain, altered biliary cholesterol saturation. Conclusion. The association among obesity, leptin, and gallstone formation may be primarily related to altered gallbladder motility and cholesterol crystal formation and only secondarily to biliary cholesterol saturation...|$|E
40|$|Central {{nervous system}} space-occupying lesions with clear-cell {{features}} encompass a nosologically heterogeneous array, ranging from reactive histiocytic proliferations to neuroepithelial or meningothelial neoplasms of various grades and to metastases. In {{the face of}} such differential diagnostic breadth, recognizing cytoplasmic lucency as part of the morphological spectrum of some low grade gliomas will directly have an impact on patient care. We describe a prevailing clear-cell change in an epileptogenic left temporal pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma surgically resected from a 36 -year-old man. Mostly subarachnoid and focally calcified, the tumor was composed of fascicles of moderately atypical spindle cells with optically lucent cytoplasm that tended to intermingle with a desmoplastic mesh of reticulin fibers. Immunohistochemically, coexpression of S 100 protein, vimentin, GFAP, and CD 34 was noted. Conversely, neither punctate staining for EMA nor positivity for CD 68 was seen. Mitotic activity was absent, and the MIB 1 labeling index was 2 - 3 % on average. Diastase-sensitive PAS-positive granula indicated clear-cell change to proceed from glycogen storage. Electron microscopy showed tumor cell cytoplasm to be largely obliterated by non-lysosomal-bound pools of glycogen, while hardly any <b>fat</b> <b>vacuole</b> was encountered. Neither ependymal-derived organelles nor annular lamellae suggesting oligodendroglial differentiation were detected. The latter differential diagnosis was further invalidated by lack of codeletion of chromosomal regions 1 p 36 and 19 q 13 on molecular genetic testing. By significantly interfering with pattern recognition as an implicit approach in histopathology, clear-cell change in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma is likely to suspend its status as a "classic", and to prompt more deductive differential diagnostic strategies to exclude look-alikes, especially clear-cell ependymoma and oligodendroglioma...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study fat {{metabolism}} and evaluate lipid deposition in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells during parenteral nutrition (PN) {{with or without}} fat. DESIGN: 20 male Sprague-Dawley rats, divided into four groups, were investigated. Rats fed orally were used as a reference group and compared to three groups of rats receiving PN either without fat or with 33 % of non-protein energy as fat or with 66 % of non-protein energy as fat. The PN regimens were equicaloric and administered continuously via a jugular catheter for 7 days. INTERVENTIONS: After suffocation, blood was collected for determination of serum lipids. Epididymal fat and heart were collected for analysis of lipoprotein lipase activities, and pieces of liver were saved for analyses of liver triglyceride concentration and hepatic lipase activity. Light and electron microscopy were used for examination of lipid deposition in Kupffer cells. RESULTS: Directly after termination of parenteral feeding, the serum levels of triglycerides were similar in all PN groups, while the levels of non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and non-HDL phospholipids were significantly increased in parallel with increased doses of fat. Lipid-free PN resulted in significantly less liver steatosis than high-fat PN. Lipid PN also resulted in downregulated hepatic lipase activity, signs of lipid accumulation in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes and an increased number of phagosomes in Kupffer cells. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Fat</b> <b>vacuoles</b> were found in Kupffer cells after lipid PN, although serum levels of triglycerides were not elevated and lipoprotein lipase activity were not depressed. The cells were distended by <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles</b> after administration of PN solutions with a high fat concentration.

5000|$|Fatty change {{represents}} the intracytoplasmatic accumulation of triglycerides (neutral fats). At the beginning, the hepatocytes present small <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles</b> (liposomes) around the nucleus (microvesicular fatty change). In this stage, liver cells {{are filled with}} multiple fat droplets that do not displace the centrally located nucleus. In the late stages, {{the size of the}} vacuoles increases, pushing the nucleus to the periphery of the cell, giving characteristic signet ring appearance (macrovesicular fatty change). These vesicles are well-delineated and optically [...] "empty" [...] because fats dissolve during tissue processing. Large vacuoles may coalesce and produce fatty cysts, which are irreversible lesions. Macrovesicular steatosis is the most common form and is typically associated with alcohol, diabetes, obesity, and corticosteroids. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy and Reye's syndrome are examples of severe liver disease caused by microvesicular fatty change. The diagnosis of steatosis is made when fat in the liver exceeds 5-10% by weight.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Patients with third degree burn wounds {{would benefit}} from a three-layer skin graft {{consisting}} of the epidermis, dermis and hypodermis. As part of the ArtiVasc 3 D EU project {{we are trying to}} come closer to this goal and to generate a vascularized 3 D skin substitute. Materials and methods: To generate the hypodermis a construct of hydrogels and electrospun matrices will be produced and then seeded with adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) and adipocytes. Results: ASCs adhered and proliferated on the matrices. After 21 days <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles</b> could be detected as a sign of successful differentiation of ASCs. The use of bioreactors additionally improved the viability of cells within the hydrogel.

40|$|Although sclerosing lipogranuloma is {{relatively}} rare, {{it is of}} special interest to urologists {{because the majority of}} the cases occur in the genital and urinary tracts. A 49 -year-old man complained of urinary frequency and lower abdominal pain. IVP examination revealed compression and irregularity of dome of bladder.

Histological findings were necrosis of the fat cells with liberation of fat droplets into the intercellular spaces. There were giant cells clinging to fatty masses and small <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles</b> in them. Essentially sclerosing lipogranuloma is a disease affecting the fat cells which for some unknown reason undergo a degenerative type of change which results in rupture of the cells with liberation of free fat droplets into the surrounding intercellular spaces and then reaction around.

40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} and define a morphologically distinctive group of cutaneous papillary haemangiomas. Methods and results: Eleven patients (seven male, four female, age range 1 - 77 years, median 57) were {{identified with a}} solitary bluish cutaneous papule (median size 11 mm) arising {{in the head and}} neck region. Most lesions had been present for several years. None of the patients had associated systemic disease or polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, skin changes (POEMS) syndrome. Only one lesion recurred locally. The lesions showed predominantly intravascular papillary growth within multiple ectatic dermal vessels. The papillae had cellular cores containing pericytes and stromal cells, arranged around normal small capillaries. The surfaces of the papillae were covered by focally swollen endothelial cells containing numerous hyaline globules, ultrastructurally representing giant lysosomes containing organelle debris and <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles</b> (so-called thanatosomes).

40|$|Tocotrienols {{have been}} {{reported}} to improve lipid profiles, reduce atherosclerotic lesions, decrease blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin concentrations, normalise blood pressure in vivo and inhibit adipogenesis in vitro, yet their role in the metabolic syndrome has not been investigated. In this study, we investigated the effects of palm tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) on high carbohydrate, high fat diet-induced metabolic, cardiovascular and liver dysfunction in rats. Rats fed a high carbohydrate, high fat diet for 16 weeks developed abdominal obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose and insulin tolerance with increased ventricular stiffness, lower systolic function and reduced liver function. TRF treatment improved ventricular function, attenuated cardiac stiffness and hypertension, and improved glucose and insulin tolerance, with reduced left ventricular collagen deposition and inflammatory cell infiltration. TRF improved liver structure and function with reduced plasma liver enzymes, inflammatory cell infiltration, <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles</b> and balloon hepatocytes. TRF reduced plasma free fatty acid and triglyceride concentrations but only omental fat deposition was decreased in the abdomen. These results suggest that tocotrienols protect the heart and liver, and improve plasma glucose and lipid profiles with minimal changes in abdominal obesity in this model of human metabolic syndrome. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} were {{to study the}} ultrastructural changes in the myelinated nerve fibers in an animal model of galactosaemia. The study {{was done in the}} Anatomy Department, Faculty of Medicine, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Twenty-four adult male albino rats were used (6 control and 12 experimental animals). Galactosaemia was induced by adding 40 % D-galactose to the rats' diet for 2 months. Sciatic nerves of the control and experimental animals were removed and processed for electron microscopic study. Four months following galactosaemia, the myelinated nerve fibers showed cytoplasmic vacuoles in Schwann cells, myelin degeneration, axonal retraction and destruction of the myelinated axons. 6 months after induction, some myelinated nerve fibers showed disruption of myelin sheaths with marked shrinkage of the axons. The endoneurial edema was prominent and some regenerating nerve fibers were reported. 8 months latter: the endoneurial and intra-axonal oedema accumulated more. Schwann cells showed cytoplasmic degenerated myelin, <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles</b> and accumulation of fine glycogen granules in the axoplasm.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{migrating}} helminth larvae do a great amlount of damage to the host. Often, however, the host is relatively large and the damage done by few larvae is not serious. When the host is very small the niechanical damnage, at least, must be proportionately greater for each larva present. An unusual case of mlortality of smlall brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) roughly 2 to 4 inches long was brought to our attention. Examination of the mortalities, as well as survivors, revealed relatively large diphyllobothrid larvae (fig. 1) in the chambers of the heart, liver, pericardial sac, and body cavity. Death of the fish was attributed to hemorrhaging caused by the migrating larvae. Some larvae appeared to be quiescent and were surrounded with sparse connective tissue and very little white cell infiltration. There was some tissue necrosis adjacent to somie of the worlms, and the livers were 2 ̆ 2 fatty 2 ̆ 2 with foam fat and sparse <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles.</b> We do not believe that either of these conditions contributed to the mortalities.

40|$|Objectives: Fine-needle {{aspiration}} cytology (FNAC) is a first-line {{investigation in}} the evaluation of neck nodules. In an attempt to search for reliable cytomorphological criteria for parathyroid lesions, we systematically evaluated cytomorphology of FNAC of parathyroid lesions. Study Design: FNAC of 15 parathyroid and 15 hyperplastic thyroid nodules with histological confirmation were reviewed for following features: Cellularity, follicles, bare nuclei, cohesiveness, vascular profiles, cytoplasmic granularity, intracytoplasmic vacuolation, mitosis, macrophages, and colloid. Results: Vascular proliferation, bare nuclei, intracytoplasmic fat vacuolation, absence of colloid, and high cellularity showed significant association with parathyroid lesions (P ≤ 0. 05). Intracytoplasmic fat vacuolation was 53. 3 % sensitive and 100 % specific for parathyroid. Follicular pattern and papillaroid clusters were also important; however, they achieved nearly significant statistical difference (P = 0. 05 and P = 0. 06, respectively). The combination of vascular proliferation and intracytoplasmic fat vacuolation were significantly associated with parathyroid (P = 0. 006) whereas the absence of bare nuclei and the presence of background colloid were associated with thyroid cytomorphology (P = 0. 03). Conclusion: No single cytological feature is helpful in differentiating parathyroid from thyroid lesion. Vascular proliferation, bare nuclei, intracytoplasmic fat vacuolation, high cellularity, and the absence of colloid were significantly associated with the parathyroid origin. The combination of at least two features - vascular proliferation and intracytoplasmic <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles</b> - were highly suggestive of parathyroid origin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. During {{a natural}} {{outbreak}} of hepatic fatty cirrhosis (HFC) in western Texas, 500 2 - 6 -year-old Rambouillet ewe sheep were sequentially studied {{to determine the}} pattern of lesion development. All sheep developed lesions of HFC. Grossly, changes first began in the subcapsular hepatic parenchyma along the porta hepatis and spread peripherally until, {{in the final stages}} of the disease, approximately 80 % of the liver was affected. Ascites, hydropericardium, and acquired hepatic vascular shunts were present in sheep with severe HFC. Light microscopic lesions initially appeared as accumulations of fine lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of periacinar hepatocytes but, with time, involved all hepatocytes of the lobule. The <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles</b> in the periacinar hepatocytes coalesced to form larger vacuoles; and after rupture of adjacent fat-laden hepatocytes, fatty cysts appeared. Fibrosis began in the periacinar zone associated with the ruptured fatty cysts and continued until there was widespread bridging periacinar fibrosis. Islands of regenerating hepatocytes were frequently sequestered within the bands of fibrous tissue. Characteristically, the hepatic and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, lung, and spleen contain ceroid. No lesions of hepatic encephalopathy were found in any animal. HFC is a progressive, chronic disease of sheep, and the morphology of the hepatic lesions is similar to lipotrope-deficient forms of nutritional cirrhosis. These findings are discussed in relation to similar nutritional deficiencies and toxicoses in sheep...|$|R

40|$|This thesis evaluates {{alterations}} in lipid metabolism and Kupffer cell morphology seen during total parenteral nutrition in healthy rats. During infusion of lipid emulsions, cholesterol and phospholipids accumulated in non-high density lipoproteins, while high density lipoproteins were enriched in triglycerides. Triglycerides also accumulated in hepatic tissue, and {{the activity of}} hepatic lipase decreased. Although lipoprotein lipase activity in the heart was up-regulated and serum levels of triglycerides were normal, suggesting that the total elimination rate of triglycerides was not impaired, ultra-structural investigations indicated that Kupffer cells were involved in clearing exogenous lipids from the blood during the infusion of long-chain triglycerides. Furthermore, the Kupffer cells were activated, according to morphological criteria. When high doses of fat were given intravenously, the Kupffer cells were grossly distended by <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles,</b> and serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase increased. During treatment with fat emulsions containing medium-chain triglycerides and long-chain triglycerides in equal amounts, the {{alterations in}} lipid transport were less pronounced, and signs of Kupffer cell activation were weaker than during infusion with long-chain triglycerides only. To some extent, the experimental findings {{may be related to}} clinical observations of a head injured patient who developed signs of acute, severe macrophage activation with haemophagocytosis during and after accumulation of exogenous fat in the blood after treatment with intravenous fat emulsions. The condition was considered to be a consequence of impaired lipid elimination and altered macrophage function during clearance of fat from the blood...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} miRNA- 384 (miR- 384) expression on hepatic steatosis in mice with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced by high-fat diet (HFD). MethodsA total of 30 male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed for 7 days {{to adapt to the}} environment and then randomly divided into 2 groups, with 15 mice in each group. The mice in the control group were given normal diet, and those in the model group were given HFD for 8 weeks and then the liver tissue was harvested. HE and Nile red staining were used to observe the pathological changes of the liver. Microarray sequencing was performed to determine the whole-genome miRNA expression profile of liver tissue, and PCR was used to measure the relative expression of miR- 384. The t-test was used for the comparison of continuous data between groups. ResultsIn the control group, the liver was red with sharp edges, the lobular structure was clear, and there was no hepatic steatosis; in the model group, the liver was yellow with blunt edges, and the hepatocytes were swollen with a large number of <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles</b> in the cytoplasm and nuclear deviation caused by the fusion of lipid droplets. Compared with the normal mice, the NAFLD mice had 12 upregulated miRNAs and 18 downregulated miRNAs in liver tissue.

Results The isolate HLX 37 consistently produced fermented milk with strong cholesterol-reducing properties was identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (accession number: KR 105940) and was thus selected for further study. The cholesterol reduction by strain HLX 37 was 45. 84 %. The isolates were acid-tolerant at pH 2. 5 and bile-tolerant at 0. 5 % (w/v) in simulated gastric juice (pH 2. 5) for 2 h and in simulated intestinal fluid (pH 8. 0) for 3 h. The auto-aggregation rate increased to 87. 74 % after 24 h, while the co-aggregation with Escherichia coli DH 5 was 27. 76 %. Strain HLX 37 was intrinsically resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin, tobramycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, vancomycin and amikacin.

Thirty-two-week-old ISA Brown Leghorn hens (n = 120) were kept in cages and were fed 1 of the 3 corn-soybean meal-based diets, a control diet (no flax) or a 10 % flax diet with or without 100 IU of tocopher-ols, until the hens were 64 wk of age. Feeding diets with 10 % flaxseed reduced hepatic and plasma fat content, hepatic triglycerides, total number of <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles,</b> and number of cells with 75 % or higher lipid infiltration in hepatocytes (P < 0. 05). Addition of tocopherols to the 10 % flax diet increased hepatic and plasma tocopherol content. A significant reduction in hepatic TBA reac-tive substances was observed in the hens supplemented with the basal diet with 10 % flax and 100 IU of to-copherols (P < 0. 05). Feeding diets containing flaxseed resulted {{in an increase in}} the content of α-linolenic (18 : n- 3) and docosahexaenoic acids (22 : 6 n- 3), with a con-comitant reduction in monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids in the hen liver and plasma. Overall, long-term feeding of hens with flax led to a reduction in liver and plasma lipids and reduced hepatocellular infiltra-tion. Inclusion of tocopherols may be needed to reduce lipid oxidation products in the liver of flax-fed hens. However, tocopherol supplementation had no effect on hepatocellular lipid infiltration or liver total lipid or triglyceride content.

40|$|Abstract Background Non {{alcoholic}} {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFL) consists in {{the accumulation of}} <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles</b> in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. Many etiologic factors are associated with NAFL, such as, the metabolic syndrome factors, medications, bariatric surgery, nutritional disorders. However, very little information is available on the clinical relevance of this disorder as a health problem in the general population. Methods and design The aim of the study is establish the risk factors most frequently associated with NAFL in a general adult population assigned to the primary care units and to investigate the relationship between each component of the metabolic syndrome and the risk of having a NAFL. A population based case-control, observational and multicenter study will be carried out in 18 primary care units from the "Area de Gestión del Barcelonés Nord y Maresme" (Barcelona) attending a population of 360, 000 inhabitants and will include 326 cases and 370 controls. Cases are defined as all subjects fulfilling the inclusion criteria and with evidence of fatty liver in an abdominal ultrasonography performed for any reason. One control will be randomly selected for each case from the population, matched for age, gender and primary care center. Controls with fatty liver or other liver diseases will be excluded. All cases and controls will be asked about previous hepatic diseases, consumption of alcohol, smoking and drugs, and a physical examination, biochemical analyses including liver function tests, the different components of the metabolic syndrome and the HAIR score will also be performed.

Materials and Methods: Liver fibrosis was induced in male adult C 57 BL/ 6 N mice (22 - 25 g; n = 12) by repetitive dosing of carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4). The respiratory-gated diffusion-weighted (DW) images were acquired using single-shot spin-echo EPI (SE-EPI) with 8 b-values and single diffusion gradient direction. True diffusion coefficient (D true), blood pseudodiffusion coefficient (D pseudo), and perfusion fraction (P fraction) were measured. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was also performed for comparison. Histology was performed with hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome staining. Results: A significant decrease in D true was found at 2 weeks and 4 weeks following CCl 4 insult, as compared with that before insult. Similarly, D pseudo values before injury was significantly higher than those at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after CCl 4 insult. Meanwhile, P fraction values showed no significant differences over different timepoints. For DTI, significant decrease in ADC was observed following CCl 4 administration. Fractional anisotropy at 2 weeks after CCl 4 insult was significantly lower than that before insult, and subsequently normalized at 4 weeks after the insult. Liver histology showed collagen deposition, the presence of intracellular <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles,</b> and cell necrosis/apoptosis in livers with CCl 4 insult. Conclusion: Both molecular water diffusion and blood microcirculation contribute to the alteration in apparent diffusion changes in liver fibrosis. Reduction in D true and D pseudo values resulted from diffusion and perfusion changes, respectively, during the progression of liver fibrosis. IVIM analysis may serve as valuable and robust tool in detecting and characterizing liver fibrosis at early stages, monitoring its progression in a noninvasive manner. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{characterize}} {{changes in}} diffusion properties of liver using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in an experimental model of liver fibrosis. Materials and Methods Liver fibrosis was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 12) by repetitive dosing of carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4). The animals were examined with a respiratory-gated single-shot spin-echo echo-planar DTI protocol at 7 T before, 2 weeks after, and 4 weeks after CCl 4 insult. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), directional diffusivities (ADC // and ADC ⊥), and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured. Liver histology was performed with hematoxylin-eosin staining and Masson's trichrome staining. Results Significant decrease (P < 0. 01) in ADC {{was found at}} 2 weeks (0. 86 ± 0. 09 × 10 - 3 mm 2 /s) and 4 weeks (0. 74 ± 0. 09 × 10 - 3 mm 2 /s) following CCl 4 insult, as compared with that before insult (0. 97 ± 0. 08 × 10 - 3 mm 2 /s). Meanwhile, FA at 2 weeks (0. 18 ± 0. 03) after CCl 4 insult was significantly lower (P < 0. 01) than that before insult (0. 26 ± 0. 05), and subsequently normalized at 4 weeks (0. 26 ± 0. 07) after the insult. Histology showed collagen deposition, presence of intracellular <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles,</b> and cell necrosis/apoptosis in livers with CCl 4 insult. Conclusion DTI detected the progressive changes in water diffusivities and diffusion anisotropy of liver tissue in this liver fibrosis model. ADC and FA are potentially valuable in detecting liver fibrosis at early stages and monitoring its progression. Future human studies are warranted to further verify the applicability of DTI in characterizing liver fibrosis and to determine its role in clinical settings. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Thymic {{size and}} T-cell {{function}} decrease with age, {{and it has}} not yet been possible to totally reverse this thymic atrophy and completely restore T-cell-dependent immune functions. In this study, GH 3 pituitary adenoma cells, which secrete growth hormone and prolactin, were implanted subcutaneously into 16 - and 22 -month-old female Wistar-Furth rats and the rats were sacrificed approximately 2 months later. Only thymic remnants were detected in aged, non-implanted rats, but thymus glands were found in both the 18 - and the 24 -month-old rats that had been implanted with GH 3 cells. Thymus glands from the GH 3 -implanted 18 -month-old rats contained distinct cortical thymocytes and medullary epithelial cells. Depending on the concentration of phytohemagglutinin or concanavalin A, T-cell proliferative responses of splenocytes from these implanted rats were 2 - to 5 -fold greater than those of 18 -month-old controls. At the optimal concentration of mitogen, proliferative responses to either lectin could be restored to those levels observed in splenocytes from 3 -month-old Wistar-Furth females. Thymus glands from 24 -month-old GH 3 -implanted rats contained more cortical thymocytes and fewer <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles</b> than controls, but they were not totally reconstituted. No significant lectin-induced T-cell proliferative responses or IL- 2 secretion were detected in 24 -month-old control rats, but splenocytes from GH 3 -implanted rats showed augmented T-cell proliferative responses and increased synthesis of IL- 2. Fluorescence-activated cell-sorter analysis of thymocytes revealed that 24 -month-old rats implanted with GH 3 cells had a higher proportion of lymphocytes with the Thy- 1. 1 and helper-T-cell phenotypes. These data show {{that it is possible to}} regenerate normal thymic tissue in situ and reverse the natural loss in cell-mediated immunity that occurs with aging...|$|R
40|$|Normal and {{centrifuged}} hyphae of Neuro¢ora {{were studied}} with the electron microscope. The following cell structures could bc identified: nuclei with nucleoli, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, glycogen, <b>fat</b> bodies, <b>vacuoles,</b> and vesicles with an inner canalicular system, of unknown nature. In centrifuged hyphac, the glycogen layer {{appeared as a}} light area, with a slight indication of granular structure. The ribosome layer consisted of densely" packed ribosomes without any membranes. The mitochondrial layer contained spaces filled with ribosomes. The nuclci were loosely packed, with endoplasmic reticulum between them. The "enchylema " layer was composed of vesicles belonging to the endoplasmic reticulum. The vacuolar layer was poorly preserved and consisted of double-walled vesicles. Fat appeared as stellate osmiophilic droplets. These observations were compared with previous observations under the optical microscope and their meaning for cell physiology was discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Fatty {{liver disease}} is {{characterized}} by the accumulation of <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles</b> inside of the hepatocytes. Non alcoholic fatty liver is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipemia, the intake of certain drugs and with the so-called metabolic syndrome. However, there is little information on the clinical relevance of this disorder as a healthcare problem in the general population, since the studies published generally include a limited number of patients and the diagnosis is established on the basis of clear biochemical alterations and liver biopsy. Methods/Design The aim of the study is the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in a general adult population by hepatic ultrasonography. A population-based, descriptive, transversal, multicentre study. Eighteen primary care centres of the north of Barcelona and the Maresme Areas of Healthcare Management attending an urban and semi-urban population of 360. 000 inhabitants. A randomized sample of 786 subjects of 15 years or older were selected from the population and assigned to the participating centres according to the Primary Care Information System (SIAP) : This population is practically the same as the general population of the area. The following determinations will be carried out in all the participants: hepatic ultrasonography to detect fatty liver, a questionnaire concerning liver diseases, alcohol intake, smoking and drug use, physical examination including abdominal perimeter and body mass index and biochemical analysis including liver function tests and parameters related to the metabolic syndrome and the HAIR score. Ultrasonographic diagnosis of fatty liver will be made according to established criteria (American Gastroenterology Association) and diagnosis of metabolic syndrome according to the criteria of the European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance. Discussion This study will attempt to determine the prevalence of non alcoholic fatty liver disease, as well as, the factors most frequently associated with the presence of this disease to thereby achieve the most appropriate treatment and avoid the evolution of the disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|Epoxy resin {{appears to}} be the best {{embedding}} material for preserving tissues for electron microscopy. Its low linear coefficient of contraction I ensures that no appreciable distortion can occur owing to polymerization damage or excessive shrinkage (1). This plastic also is exceptionally stable in the electron beam, so that surface damage to the section is slight. Although Araldite blocks are often more difficult to cut than those of methacrylate, the introduction of the diamond knife (2) with its superior cutting abilities over The linear contraction is less than 1 per cent, an amount even lower than that of the polyester resins like Vestopal W, which contract about 2. 5 per cent (author's measurements, unpublished data). the glass knife has considerably reduced this difficulty. The greatest disadvantage of Araldite is the low contrast of sections of osmium tetroxidefixed material in the electron microscope. In the author's experience, satisfactory lead staining (3, 4) of Araldite sections is difficult to obtain. More contrast is achieved by staining Araldite sections with potassium permanganate (5, 6), but a fine precipitate on the stained sections is troublesome. Potassium permanganate-fixed tissues (7) show satisfactory contrast in Araldite, but permanganate fixation appears less perfect than osmium tetroxide fixation in several respects (8). Mitochondria are nearly always swollen, and some structures, e. g. 492 B R I E F N O • ~. SRNA granules and <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles,</b> either are not stained or are oxidized or leached away during fixation. On the other hand, permanganate has proved especially useful for the study of membranous structures of the cell (9). In recent experiments to study the effects of ionizing radiation on cell membranes, many attempts were made to prevent the swelling and breaking-up of mitochondria during fixation by permanganate solutions. The combined use of a modified osmium tetroxide fixative, Araldite embedding, and staining of the tissue in an acetone solution of potassium permanganate was found to give good preservation and increased contrast of these structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{extended}} essay is {{to investigate the}} effect of corticosteroids (CS) on the differentiation and growth of adipocytes from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). My research question was “Do CSs have any impact on the differentiation and growth of adipocytes from MSCs?” Six wells were used; Well 1 -only MSC (control); Well 2 - 0. 2 mg dexamethasone (DXM) with MSC; Well 3 - 5 mg DXM with MSC; Well 4 - Adipogenic differentiation solution (ADS) with MSC (ADS control); Well 5 - 0. 2 mg DXM with ADS and MSC; Well 6 - 5 mg DXM with ADS and MSC. Adipogenic differentiation and growth were assessed by an inverted phase-contrast microscope by noting the appearance of fat cells and making cell counts at the 5 th, 10 th and 15 th days. At the 5 th day, small <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles</b> that indicated adipogenic differentiation was noted only in Well 6. At the 10 th day, such differentiation was noted in Wells 3, 4, 5 {{as well as in}} Well 6 with the maximum cell count in Well 6 (Well 6 versus Wells 1, 2 and 3, p< 0. 05). The size of the lipid droplets in Well 6 increased when compared to Day 5 assessment. At the 15 th day, the growth and differentiation further increased in Wells 4, 5 and 6; Wells 1, 2 and 3 had significantly less cell counts when compared to Wells 4, 5 and 6 (p< 0. 05). Moreover, at Day 15, the sizes of the lipid droplets in Wells 4, 5, 6 and also Well 3 increased when compared to Day 10 assessment. I conclude that DXM, in a dose-response manner, affect both the development (hyperplasia) and the size (hypertrophia) of adipocytes in the MSC model. These data contribute to our understanding of development of obesity as a side effect of CS treatment...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{healing of}} a {{ruptured}} {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) is reconsidered. In a previous study, we {{have shown that the}} transected ACL can heal after treatment with the triple X locking suture alone or combined with small intestine submucosa (SIS). The first research question of this study was whether the healing ACLs in both groups show histological characteristics that are typical for ligament healing. Secondly, did the combined treatment with SIS lead to improved histological healing, in terms of the morphology of the fibrous synovial layer, the extracellular matrix (ECM), collagen fiber orientation, cellularity, ratio of myofibroblasts, and collagen type 3 staining. The hypothesis was that SIS enhances the healing by the scaffolding effect, endogenous growth factors, and chemoattractants. In the Suture group, the left ACL was transected and sutured with the triple X locking suture repair technique. In the Suture-SIS group, the left ACL underwent the same procedure with the addition of SIS. The right ACL served as internal control. Standard histology and immunostaining of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and collagen type 3 were used. Microscopy showed that the fibrous synovial layer around the ACL was reestablished in both groups. The collagen fibers in the Suture-SIS group stained denser, were more compactly arranged, and the ECM contained fewer voids and <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles.</b> Neovasculature running between the collagen fibers was observed in both experimental groups. Collagen type 3 stained less in the Suture-SIS group. The cellularity in the Suture group, Suture-SIS group and Control was 1265 [*]±[*] 1034 per mm(2), 954 [*]±[*] 378 per mm(2), 254 [*]±[*] 92, respectively; 49 %, 26 % and 20 % of the cells stain positive for α-SMA, respectively. The healing ACL in both treated groups showed histological characteristics which are comparable to the spontaneously healing medial collateral ligament and showed that the ACL has a similar intrinsic healing response. Though, no definitive conclusions on the beneficial effects of the SIS scaffold on the healing process can be mad...|$|R
40|$|There are {{relatively}} few published reports on anatomy and histology of liver and pancreas of commercial domestic turkeys {{as well as}} their wild relatives, wild type turkeys. In this study a commercial domestic turkey strain (British United Turkeys, B. U. T. Big 6) was compared to an original wild type turkey strain (Wild Canadian Turkeys, WTC) with focus on anatomy, histology and morphometry of liver and pancreas. 5 domestic and 8 wild type turkeys at the age of 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks and additionally a group of wild type turkeys at the age of 24 weeks have been examined. The organs were photographed in situ, than measured, weighed and macroscopically investigated. A qualitative description of the organs, a semiquantitative evaluation of their fine tissue structure and a measurement of the hepatic plates was carried out using light and transmission electro microscopic sections. In the case of the pancreas, distinction of various pancreatic islets and their cell structure was the focal point. The domestic and wild type turkey lines were shown to have similar liver structure, liver impressions, topography and shape. In comparison differences have been found in the absolute body and liver ratio, the relative liver mass (were mostly higher in wild turkeys) as well as the size of the individual lobes of the liver. In contrary to domestic turkeys, significant differences in texture and colour have been observed in the liver of wild type turkeys in the course of aging. The liver of adult versus juvenile wild type turkeys was more pale and friable. The hepatic lobule typical for mammalian liver parenchyma could not be observed in both lines. Instead, both showed a three dimensional meshwork and the composition of a hepatic plate, consisting of 6 - 7 hepatocytes, was shown to be identical in both domestic and wild type turkeys. Histologically two types of lymphocytic areas that have not yet been described in current literature could be observed on both turkey lines. Furthermore, in domestic and wild type turkeys eosinophilic granulocytes were seen in liver tissue. While distribution of fat within liver parenchyma of domestic and wild type turkeys showed little difference, a larger fraction of <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles</b> occurs in the liver of wild type turkeys rather than in those of domestic turkeys that are adapted to concentrated feed. Periodical {{decline in the number of}} <b>fat</b> <b>vacuoles</b> of both lines was associated with a significant gain in body mass. Anastomosing plates and lateral interhepatocytic surfaces of domestic and wild type turkeys appeared to be similar. Both strains exhibit mitochondria of Crista type as well as Interstellate-, Kupffer- and Fat-Storing-Cells. The hepatic cell plate sizes and the number of hepatic plates forming hepatocytes varied between the individual groups. The pancreata of domestic and wild type turkeys correspond in topography, colour, structure and length, however, differences were found in pancreatic mass. Both turkey lines displayed an identical number of pancreatic ducts. Accordingly lymphocytic areas were observed in the exocrine pancreas. The exocrine pancreas cells showed large, in diameter 1. 500 ηm zymogenic granules as well as predominantly roundish oval mitochondria and richly developed rough endoplasmic reticulum. In both turkey lines the A-islets were found to be larger than the B-islets with similar cell composition as well as granular size. The mitochondria were smaller than in the exocrine pancreas. In the present study an endocrine pancreas islet consisting of equal shares of A- and D-cells could be observed. Such an islet has not been described in the available literature, but was observed in one 8 week old wild type turkey exclusively. Also the B-islets of domestic and wild type turkeys were shown to be similar in size as well as granular shape. They were surrounded by a thin layer of fibrous tissue and in comparison to the exocrine pancreas, showed smaller mitochondria. APP cells could be found in both turkey lines. No difference in the occurrence of Type IV cells was found between domestic and wild type turkeys. In contrary to other pancreas cells, their granula appeared to be highly biconcave without a light-coloured peripheral halo and without a membrane. In conclusion no fundamental differences exist between B. U. T. Big 6 - and WCT-turkeys with respect to the morphology of the liver and the pancreas...|$|R
