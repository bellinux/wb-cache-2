25|$|The Armstrong School District {{offers a}} wide variety of clubs, {{activities}} and an extensive <b>junior</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> school sports program. In 2013, Armstrong School District spent over $1.5 million for activities (not including facilities costs or transportation). In 2014, Armstrong School District spent over $1.8 million for activities (not including facilities costs or transportation). The total revenue received by the district from all activities was only $107,500 in 2013. The district is especially challenged because it operates multiple high schools there by duplicating sports teams and the associated costs like coaches salaries, officials salaries, transportation, facilities and their maintenance, administration, uniforms and so on. Armstrong School Board determines eligibility policies to participate in these programs. When the planned high school and junior high school consolidation occurs in 2014-15, some duplicate teams will be eliminated.|$|E

[...] When asked {{about the way she}} spent her youth, Tyler said: [...] "For me, I didn’t get much of a childhood in my teen years because I’ve been working since I was 14. But that also kept me out of trouble. When everybody was doing acid and partying like crazy, I was at work on a movie in Tuscany... having my own fun, of course, but it was a different kind of thing. I have no regrets. I love the way my life has gone." ...|$|E

Recognizing that their musical relationship was still intact, the trio began rehearsing with Todd and Nelson, working on material that would become [...] "Dirty Little Thing", but eventually decided against forming a group with them. During a Loaded show at West Hollywood's Viper Room, McKagan introduced Kushner to Slash, who were previously friends in <b>junior</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> school. Kushner was invited to jam with the group and was soon invited to join with Slash, stating that [...] "Dave brought a cool vibe to what [...] were doing.

500|$|After {{the divorce}} became final in 1976, the children, then aged 12 and 9, {{returned}} {{to live with}} their mother, who was director of nursing at a Montreal hospital. [...] In 1977, the family moved to a house purchased in the middle-class Montreal suburb of Pierrefonds. Gamil Gharbi attended <b>junior</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>high</b> school, where he was described as a quiet student who obtained average to above average marks. He developed a close friendship with another boy, but he did not fit in with other students. [...] Taunted as an Arab because of his name, at the age of 14 he legally changed it to [...] "Marc Lépine", citing his hatred of his father as the reason for taking his mother's surname. Lépine was uncommunicative and showed little emotion. He suffered from low self-esteem, exacerbated by his chronic acne. [...] Family relations remained difficult; his younger sister Nadia publicly humiliated him about his acne and his lack of girlfriends. He fantasized about her death, and on one occasion made a mock grave for her. [...] He was overjoyed when in 1981 she was placed in a group home because of her delinquent behaviour and drug abuse. Seeking a good male role model for Lépine, his mother arranged for a Big Brother. For two years, the experience proved positive as Lépine, often with his best friend, enjoyed the time with photography and moto-cross motorcycles. However, in 1979 the meetings ceased abruptly when the Big Brother was detained on suspicion of molesting young boys. Both Lépine and his Big Brother denied that any molestation had occurred. Lépine owned an air rifle as a teenager, which he used to shoot pigeons near his home with his friend. [...] They also enjoyed designing and building electronic gadgets. [...] He developed an interest in World War II and an admiration of Adolf Hitler, and enjoyed action and horror movies. [...] Lépine also took considerable responsibility at home, including cleaning and doing repairs while his mother worked.|$|E
