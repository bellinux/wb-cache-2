5|$|There are {{thousands}} of uses of various potassium compounds. One example is potassium superoxide, , an orange solid {{that acts as a}} portable source of oxygen and a carbon dioxide absorber. It is widely used in respiration systems in mines, submarines and spacecraft as it takes less volume than the <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxygen.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{electrolysis}} {{of water}} is a simple method of producing hydrogen. A low voltage current is run through the water, and <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxygen</b> forms at the anode while gaseous hydrogen forms at the cathode. Typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals. (Iron, for instance, would oxidize, and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off.) The theoretical maximum efficiency (electricity used vs. energetic value of hydrogen produced) is in the range 80–94%.|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{can catch}} fire when a fresh, non-{{oxidized}} surface {{comes in contact}} with liquid oxygen. Fresh metal may be exposed when the oxidized surface is struck or scratched with a hard object, or when mechanical strain causes a crack. This poses a limitation to its use in liquid oxygen systems, {{such as those in}} the aerospace industry. Because titanium tubing impurities can cause fires when exposed to oxygen, titanium is prohibited in <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxygen</b> respiration systems. Steel tubing is used for high pressure systems (3,000 p.s.i.) and aluminium tubing for low pressure systems.|$|E
50|$|Air {{can be more}} {{specifically}} described as a <b>gaseous</b> solution (<b>oxygen</b> and other gases dissolved in the major component, nitrogen). Since interactions between molecules play almost no role, dilute gases form rather trivial solutions. In part of the literature, they are not even classified as solutions.|$|R
50|$|Common oxidizers include <b>gaseous</b> or liquid <b>oxygen,</b> nitrous oxide, and {{hydrogen}} peroxide. For a reverse hybrid, oxidizers such as frozen oxygen and ammonium perchlorate are used.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} for the determination of wooden artefacts based on {{the correlation between the}} number of carboxyl groups present in the wood sample and its age, on the number of carboxylic groups the immobilized enzymatic activity depends. A glucose oxidase biosensor in which a wooden disk on which the enzyme glucose oxidase is immobilized is used, with a <b>gaseous</b> diffusion <b>oxygen</b> amperometric transducer...|$|R
25|$|Conversely, non-spontaneous {{electrochemical}} reactions can {{be driven}} {{forward by the}} application of a current at sufficient voltage. The electrolysis of water into <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxygen</b> and hydrogen is a typical example.|$|E
25|$|When {{comparing}} the reduction potentials in reactions 2 and 4, {{the reduction of}} chloride ion is favored. Thus, if the Cl− ion is favored for reduction, then the water reaction is favored for oxidation producing <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxygen,</b> however experiments show gaseous chlorine is produced and not oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is a harmful {{byproduct of}} many normal metabolic processes; to prevent damage to cells and tissues, {{it must be}} quickly converted into other, less dangerous substances. To this end, catalase is frequently used by cells to rapidly catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into less-reactive <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxygen</b> and water molecules.|$|E
40|$|Technology {{for long}} life, high performing, <b>gaseous</b> hydrogen-gaseous <b>oxygen</b> rocket engines {{suitable}} for auxiliary propulsion {{was provided by}} a combined analytical and experimental program. Propellant injectors, fast response valves, igniters, and regeneratively and film-cooled thrust chambers were tested {{over a wide range}} of operating conditions. Data generated include performance, combustion efficiency, thermal characteristics film cooling effectiveness, dynamic response in pulsing, and cycle life limitations...|$|R
50|$|Parts of Mayow's work {{seems to}} agree with modern ideas {{regarding}} air and combustion. Mayow noted, as had others before him, that some materials gain weight on strong heating. Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794) and others later interpreted this gain {{in terms of a}} reaction with a <b>gaseous</b> material (<b>oxygen)</b> in the air. See Holmyard and others for critiques of Mayow's work and comparisons to modern chemical thought.|$|R
40|$|Propellant shutoff valves {{required}} for {{the operation of the}} pulse modulated <b>gaseous</b> hydrogen/gaseous <b>oxygen</b> rocket engines for the Space Shuttle Auxiliary Propulsion System are specified to operate for one million cycles over a ten-year period with zero maintenance, very fast response, very low leakage, and over a wide temperature range. Based on an analytical leakage and wear model, sealing configurations were conceived, sized, and developed. Two prototype valves featuring different components were designed, built, and evaluated for 100, 000 cycles. Design concepts and test results are presented...|$|R
25|$|The ET {{has five}} {{propellant}} umbilical valves that interface with orbiter umbilicals: {{two for the}} liquid oxygen tank and three for the liquid hydrogen tank. One of the liquid oxygen tank umbilical valves is for liquid oxygen, the other for <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxygen.</b> The liquid hydrogen tank umbilical has two valves for liquid and one for gas. The intermediate-diameter liquid hydrogen umbilical is a recirculation umbilical used only during the liquid hydrogen chill-down sequence during prelaunch.|$|E
25|$|When closed, a well-maintained bin is odorless; when opened, {{it should}} have little smell if any smell is present, it is earthy. Worms require <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxygen.</b> Oxygen can be {{provided}} by airholes in the bin, occasional stirring of bin contents, and removal of some bin contents if they become too deep or too wet. If decomposition becomes anaerobic from excess wet feedstock added to the bin, or the layers of food waste have become too deep, the bin will begin to smell of ammonia.|$|E
25|$|At T-31 seconds, {{just before}} Atlantis's {{computers}} {{were supposed to}} take control of the flight, the launch countdown clock stopped. This was because of a lack of an indication that the <b>Gaseous</b> <b>Oxygen</b> Vent Arm had retracted and properly latched, a problem that had never occurred during previous launches in the program's history. Soon the launch team was able to verify the Vent Arm's position with the help of a closed circuit camera, and the countdown clock resumed after approximately 2 minutes, 18 seconds.|$|E

50|$|Xenic acid is a {{noble gas}} {{compound}} {{formed by the}} dissolution of xenon trioxide in water. Its chemical formula is H2XeO4. It {{is a very powerful}} oxidizing agent, and its decomposition is dangerous as it liberates a large amount of <b>gaseous</b> products: xenon, <b>oxygen,</b> and ozone.|$|R
50|$|An {{oxidizer}} is a {{pure substance}} (molecule) that in a chemical reaction can contribute some atoms {{of one or more}} oxidizing elements, in which the fuel component of the explosive burns. On the simplest level, the oxidizer may itself be an oxidizing element, such as <b>gaseous</b> or liquid <b>oxygen.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{presence}} {{of water in}} a solution of sodium chloride must be examined in respect to its reduction and oxidation in both electrodes. Usually, water is electrolysed as mentioned in electrolysis of water yielding <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxygen</b> in the anode and gaseous hydrogen in the cathode. On the other hand, sodium chloride in water dissociates in Na+ and Cl− ions, cation, which is the positive ion, will be attracted to the cathode (-), thus reducing the sodium ion. The anion will then be attracted to the anode (+) oxidizing chloride ion.|$|E
25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the Lightning was {{designed}} to meet the RAF's OR946 specification for tactical air navigation technology, and thus featured an integrated flight instrument display arrangement, an Elliott Bros (London) Ltd auto-pilot, a master reference gyroscopic reader, an auto-attack system, and an instrument landing system. Despite initial scepticism of the aircraft's centralised detection and warning system, the system proved its merits during the development program and was subsequently redeveloped for greater reliability. Communications included UHF and VHF radios and a datalink. Unlike the previous generation of aircraft which used <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxygen</b> for lifesupport, the Lightning would employ liquid oxygen-based apparatus for the pilot; cockpit pressurisation and conditioning would be maintained through tappings from the engine compressors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gaseous</b> <b>oxygen</b> is {{excluded}} from the reactions by physical containment. Anaerobes utilize electron acceptors from sources other than oxygen gas. These acceptors can be the organic material itself or may be supplied by inorganic oxides from within the input material. When the oxygen source in an anaerobic system {{is derived from the}} organic material itself, the 'intermediate' end products are primarily alcohols, aldehydes, and organic acids, plus carbon dioxide. In the presence of specialised methanogens, the intermediates are converted to the 'final' end products of methane, carbon dioxide, and trace levels of hydrogen sulfide. In an anaerobic system, the majority of the chemical energy contained within the starting material is released by methanogenic bacteria as methane.|$|E
50|$|Water {{subjected}} to ionizing radiation forms free radicals of hydrogen and hydroxyl, which can recombine to form <b>gaseous</b> hydrogen, <b>oxygen,</b> hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, and peroxide radicals. In living organisms, which are composed mostly of water, {{majority of the}} damage {{is caused by the}} reactive oxygen species, free radicals produced from water. The free radicals attack the biomolecules forming structures within the cells, causing oxidative stress (a cumulative damage which may be significant enough to cause the cell death, or may cause DNA damage possibly leading to cancer).|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program was}} conducted to evaluate the catalytic ignition of <b>gaseous</b> hydrogen and <b>oxygen</b> propellants. Shell 405 granular catalyst and a monolithic sponge catalyst were tested. Mixture ratio, mass flow rate, propellant temperature, and back pressure were varied parametrically in testing to determine the operational limits of the catalytic igniter. The test {{results show that the}} <b>gaseous</b> hydrogen and <b>oxygen</b> propellant combination can be ignited catalytically using Shell 405 catalyst over a wide range of mixture ratios, mass flow rates, and propellant injection temperatures. These operating conditions must be optimized to ensure reliable ignition {{for an extended period of}} time. A cyclic life of nearly 2000, 2 sec pulses at nominal operating conditions was demonstrated with the catalytic igniter. The results of the experimental program and the established operational limits for a catalytic igniter using the Shell 405 catalyst are presented...|$|R
50|$|Oxidation {{catalysis}} {{is conducted}} by both heterogeneous catalysis and homogeneous catalysis. In the heterogeneous processes, <b>gaseous</b> substrate and <b>oxygen</b> (or air) are passed over solid catalysts. Typical catalysts are platinum, and redox-active oxides of iron, vanadium, and molybdenum. In many cases, catalysts are modified {{with a host}} of additives or promoters that enhance rates or selectivities.|$|R
25|$|Cockroaches, {{like all}} insects, breathe through {{a system of}} tubes called tracheae. The tracheae of insects are {{attached}} to the spiracles, excluding the head. Thus cockroaches, like all insects, are not dependent on the mouth and windpipe to breathe. The valves open when the CO2 level in the insect rises to a high level; then the CO2 diffuses out of the tracheae to the outside and fresh O2 diffuses in. Unlike in vertebrates that depend on blood for transporting O2 and CO2, the tracheal system brings the air directly to cells, the tracheal tubes branching continually like a tree until their finest divisions, tracheoles, are associated with each cell, allowing <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxygen</b> to dissolve in the cytoplasm lying across the fine cuticle lining of the tracheole. CO2 diffuses out of the cell into the tracheole. While cockroaches do not have lungs and thus do not actively breathe in the vertebrate lung manner, in some very large species the body musculature may contract rhythmically to forcibly move air out and in the spiracles; this may be considered a form of breathing.|$|E
500|$|Uptake of [...] {{from the}} air is the {{essential}} purpose of respiration, so oxygen supplementation is used in medicine. Treatment not only increases oxygen levels in the patient's blood, but has the secondary effect of decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs, easing work load on the heart. Oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema, pneumonia, some heart disorders (congestive heart failure), some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure, and any disease that impairs the body's ability to take up and use <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxygen.</b>|$|E
500|$|The other primary {{method of}} {{producing}} [...] is passing {{a stream of}} clean, dry air through one bed {{of a pair of}} identical zeolite molecular sieves, which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90%to93% [...] Simultaneously, nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed, by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it, in the reverse direction of flow. After a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged, thereby allowing for a continuous supply of <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxygen</b> to be pumped through a pipeline. This is known as pressure swing adsorption. Oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non-cryogenic technologies (see also the related vacuum swing adsorption).|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{stability}} of ultrafine grained, elemental metal powder compacts (Cu, Ag, Pd) with low impurity content and high mass density were investigated by DSC and TEM measurements. In all our samples the crystallites grow abnormally. Grain growth {{is found to}} set in at temperatures below the recrystallization temperature known from coarse grained metals that have been heavily cold worked. For Cu and Pd even at ambient conditions abnormal grain growth occurs. Porosity up to 15 % does not change grain growth temperature and abnormal grain growth behaviour. <b>Gaseous</b> impurities (<b>oxygen)</b> tend to stabilize the grain boundaries and enhance the effective activation energy for the grain growth proces...|$|R
40|$|Valves for the <b>gaseous</b> hydrogen/gaseous <b>oxygen</b> shuttle {{auxiliary}} propulsion system {{are required to}} feature low leakage over a wide temperature range coupled with high cycle life, long term compatibility and minimum maintenance. In addition, those valves used as thruster shutoff valves must feature fast response characteristics to achieve small, repeatable minimum impulse bits. These valve technology problems are solved by developing unique valve components such as sealing closures, guidance devices, and actuation means and by demonstrating two prototype valve concepts. One of the prototype valves is cycled over one million cycles without exceeding a leakage rate of 27 scc's per hour at 450 psia helium inlet pressure throughout the cycling program...|$|R

500|$|Oxygen storage {{methods include}} high {{pressure}} oxygen tanks, cryogenics and chemical compounds. For reasons of economy, oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since one liter of liquefied oxygen {{is equivalent to}} 840liters of <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxygen</b> at atmospheric pressure and [...] Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions that need large volumes of pure oxygen gas. Liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers, which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building. Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and oxy-fuel welding and cutting.|$|E

2500|$|After STS-4, {{several hundred}} pounds were {{eliminated}} by deleting the anti-geyser line. This line paralleled the oxygen feed line, providing a circulation path for liquid oxygen. This reduces accumulation of <b>gaseous</b> <b>oxygen</b> in the feed line during prelaunch tanking (loading of the LOX). After propellant loading data from ground tests {{and the first}} few space shuttle missions were assessed, the anti-geyser line was removed for subsequent missions. The total length and diameter of the ET remain unchanged. The last SWT, flown on STS-7, weighed approximately [...] inert.|$|E
