40|$|AbstractCurrent {{processes}} for producing transmission gears involve hobbing, milling or shaping of a forged stock {{to obtain the}} gear shape. Gears are typically formed by hobbing tools made from solid tooling material, such as tungsten carbide, and have dozens of teeth. The gear hobbing process entails several teeth in cut simultaneously. Generation of in-volute <b>tooth</b> <b>profiles</b> results in varying chip loads from pass to pass. In this paper, details are provided for a finite element-based model of gear hobbing and milling processes. The model explicitly meshes gear cutter geometries with dozens of teeth. These cutters are used to simulate the complicated kinematic motion between tool and workpiece. Thermo-mechanical coupled calculations within an explicit dynamic formulation are per-formed on the tool and workpiece during chip removal. The complex geometry of <b>involute</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>profiles</b> results in complicated contact scenarios on the evolving workpiece geometry during <b>tooth</b> <b>profile</b> generation. Tooth-workpiece-chip contact is enforced rigorously and is particularly complicated with the confined space of gear hobbing. Advanced adaptive meshing strategies are developed and employed to maintain {{the resolution of the}} tool-workpiece interaction while multiple teeth are in contact. Cutting forces, temperatures and stresses in the tool and workpiece are predicted for steel workpiece materials. Models are validated through a set of initially simplified experiments where incremental complexity is added, allowing for direct comparison between predicted and measured forces and chip shapes...|$|R

Forming processes offer particularly high optimisation potential compared to the actual gear fabrication processes.

Based on the finished gear, material savings up to 30 % depending on the gear geometry can be achieved. Other advantages of forming <b>involute</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>profiles</b> by cold rolling are extremely short process times, no material loss, elimination of waste removal, contour related and refined grain structure and minimal thermal distortion after heat treatment processes. 40 % strain hardening of the gear flank zone, 80 % of the tooth root area compared to basic hardness as well as high achievable surface roughnesses of Ra = 0. 4 mm/ Rz = 1. 5 mm are advantageous for applications without subsequent heat treatment.

40|$|This paper explores ways {{in which}} gear teeth that possess 2 ̆ 2 {{designed}} compliance 2 ̆ 2; that is, tooth flexure that {{is an integral part}} of the designed mechanical system, affect transmission of angular motion and torque. It is commonly assumed that deformation of engineered components is counterproductive to the function and performance of machinery and, hence, must be minimized. However, none of the current gear designs alone can address problems such as absorption of shock loads, vibration (2 ̆ 2 chatter 2 ̆ 2) attenuation, and reduction of the overall mass and inertia. Allowing gear teeth to have a designed flexibility is another way of approaching the above problems in gear system design. In this study, the deformation of flexible gear teeth is treated as a classical curved beam deformation problem. A quasi-static, mechanics based model is used for computing displacements of slender <b>tooth</b> <b>profiles</b> subjected to contact forces that arise during the tooth engagement process. The teeth are analyzed as slender cantilever circular beams with a constant curvature and the curved beam model is based on the Castigliano 2 ̆ 7 s energy theory for displacement. Non-dimensional parameters are created to study the effects of various design parameters on gear properties such as the pressure line and the satisfaction of the law of gearing. It is observed from conducted studies that the engagement process involving <b>teeth</b> with circular <b>profiles</b> has properties which differ from those of rigid gears with <b>involute</b> <b>profile</b> <b>teeth.</b> The pressure line for gears with circular teeth is not linear and the law of gearing is not satisfied with this profile.

40|$|Abstract The tooth {{flanks of}} bevel gears with <b>involute</b> <b>teeth</b> are still cut using approximations such as Tredgold’s and octoid curves, while the {{geometry}} of the exact spherical involute is well known. The modeling of the tooth flanks of gears with skew axes, however, still represents a challenge to geometers. Hence, {{there is a need}} to develop algorithms for the geometric modeling of these gears. As a matter of fact, the modeling of gears with skew axes and <b>involute</b> <b>teeth</b> is still an open question, as it is not even known whether it makes sense to speak of such tooth geometries. This paper is a contribution along these lines, as pertaining to gears with skew axes and cycloid teeth. To this end, the authors follow and extend results reported by Martin Disteli at the turn of the 20 th century concerning the general synthesis of gears with skew axes. The main goal is to shed light on {{the geometry of}} the tooth flanks of gears with skew axes. The dualization of the <b>tooth</b> <b>profiles</b> of spherical cycloidal gears leads to ruled surfaces as conjugate tooth flanks such that at any instant the contact points are located on a straight line.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model {{is presented in}} the paper for predicting involute profile deflection in hot precision forging of gears. This model is a function of a number of material and processing parameters, including the thermal expansion of the die, thermal contraction of workpiece, elastic expansion of the die during forging, and workpiece recovery after ejection. To improve the accuracy of the hot forged gear tooth, an equation set to define modified involute that is used to design the die tooth has been proposed based on the model. The distribution of deflection along the involute was also predicted using the commercial FE code, PRO-E. The deflection characteristic of the toothed die through the tooth width was analyzed by combining the theoretical method and FEM to investigate the non-uniform deflection. The dimension of the forged gears was measured using a gear measurement machine WGT 3000. A close agreement between predicted and measured <b>tooth</b> <b>involute</b> <b>profiles</b> was obtained, which validated the involute deflection prediction model.

40|$|The hobbing {{theory of}} {{generating}} the <b>involute</b> gear <b>teeth</b> has been often reported.

40|$|The area of gear {{dynamics}} and noise, {{which is the}} most underdeveloped area of gear design, has recently been the focus of many studies. The proper kinematic and geometric design of gears, the mathematical modeling of gear systems, and the analysis of vibration excitation of gears and gear systems are essential for a good design. This work presents a state-of-the-art review of gear noise, the general area of gear design for reducing noise, and practical approaches used for machinery noise reduction along with a summary of methods available for predicting gear noise in terms of the transmission error. ^ A new method is proposed for reducing the vibration and noise of involute gears. The method is based on the use of cubic spline curves for gear <b>tooth</b> <b>profile</b> modification. The <b>tooth</b> <b>profile</b> is constrained to assume an involute shape during the loaded operation so that it ensures conjugate motion at all points along the line of action. The new profile is found to result in a more uniform static transmission error compared to the standard involute profile, thereby contributing to the improvement of the vibration and noise characteristics of the gear. The methodology is extended for the minimization of the transmission error in helical gears. Using the concept of optimal modification of the plane of action to generate the new <b>tooth</b> <b>profile,</b> the idea of a perfect plane of action of helical gears is introduced. The proposed method constitutes a general tooth correction method and makes the design, unlike other modification schemes presented in the literature, less complex, less sensitive to dynamic factors, and easier to manufacture while retaining the involute characteristics. A dynamic analysis of the gear drive with the <b>involute</b> <b>tooth</b> and the modified <b>tooth</b> <b>profile</b> (using cubic splines) is performed to establish the fact that a reduction in the transmission error reduces the gear vibration and noise due to smaller dynamic tooth loads during a meshing cycle. For this, first the tooth deformation is found and then the tooth dynamic load is determined for all reasonable speeds. A parameter study is also conducted to establish the superiority of the cubic spline (C. S.) based gear profile over the involute profile as well as those based on the use of linear and parabolic tip reliefs. ...|$|R
