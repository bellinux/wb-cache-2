The upper limit for number <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> hypotheses is determined by finding maximum difference between expected true hypotheses and false hypotheses among all possible sets <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> hypotheses.

Of particular interest to forensic document examiners, <b>ink</b> analysis <b>of</b> security documents has emerged as an important tool for the analysis, comparison, and association <b>of</b> <b>inks</b> to a potential production source. In this study, methods were developed for Py-GC/MS, ATR-FTIR, DART-MS, and MALDI-MS analyses <b>of</b> printing <b>inks</b> <b>of</b> four classes: 78 inkjet inks, 76 toners, 79 offset inks, and 86 intaglio inks in order to generate information on the organic chemical characterization <b>of</b> the <b>inks</b> to determine the ability to associate and discriminate the inks for uses in security document examinations. The suite of analytical techniques evaluated in the study focused on having the following analytical characteristics: 1) rapid analysis time, 2) little-to-no sample preparation, 3) minimal destructiveness to the sample, 4) allow for association <b>of</b> <b>inks</b> with the same source of origin as well as discrimination <b>of</b> <b>inks</b> originating from different sources.
