Our study of such lattices differs from the literature in the fact that we must take into account the different orders of magnitude of the extensional and <b>flexural</b> <b>stiffnesses.</b> This allows us to consider structures which would have been floppy when considering only extensional stiffness and completely rigid when considering <b>flexural</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> of the same order of magnitude than the extensional ones.

If these moments are distributed in the structural elements such as shear walls and frames with regard of their corresponding <b>flexural</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> [(EI/h) or (EI/l)], then the approximate values of the actual end moments can be obtained. It is worth stating that if the shear walls are significantly different, or if there are great variations in the shear wall areas at each floor level, then the above calculation method can lead to false results. In this case, it is necessary to consider an idealized structure with more than one shear wall connected to the frame by means of tension elements, and the stiffness of each one must be calculated separately. Then the stiffness of the idealized structure can be calculated by summation of the distinct stiffnesses.|$|R
40|$|Moment {{redistribution}} in beams {{has traditionally}} been considered as an ultimate limit state (ULS) phenomenon closely associated with considerations of reinforcement ductility. This paper demonstrates that {{a significant proportion of}} this redistribution will almost always occur at the serviceability limit state (SLS) because of the mismatch between the <b>flexural</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> assumed when calculating moments for the ULS and those actually occurring at the SLS due to variations in the reinforcement layout along the member and the influence of cracking.

Tests on 33 two-span beams are then presented, parameters investigated being values of redistribution, beam depth, reinforcement arrangements, concrete strength and the effect of brittle reinforcement. The results confirm that there is significant redistribution at the SLS and that there is scope for increasing the permissible limits for redistribution beyond those currently prescribed in design codes. This is supported by further modelling although it is shown that considerations of crack width may become a limiting factor...|$|R

The governing equations are simplified on the basis of physically justifiable assumptions and are shown to reduce to simpler models published in the literature. The resulting nonlinear {{equations of motion}} are used to investigate the flexural–torsional buckling of translating continua such as belts and tapes caused by parallel pulley misalignment. The effect of pulley misalignment on the steady motion (equilibrium) solutions and the bifurcation characteristics of the system are investigated numerically. The system undergoes multiple pitchfork bifurcations as misalignment is increased, with out-of-plane equilibria born at each bifurcation. The amount of misalignment to cause buckling and the post-buckled shapes are determined for various translation speeds and ratios of the <b>flexural</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> in the two bending planes.

40|$|In this paper, the {{development}} and assessment of a stiffness reduction method for the in-plane design of steel frames is presented. The adopted stiffness reduction approach is implemented by reducing the <b>flexural</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> (EI) {{of the members of}} a steel frame by considering the first-order forces they are subjected to through the stiffness reduction functions and performing Geometrically Nonlinear Analysis (i. e. second-order elastic analysis). Since the presented approach uses stiffness reduction functions that fully take into account the deleterious influence of imperfections and the spread of plasticity on the structural response and member strengths, it obviates the need of using member design equations, and only requires cross-section strength checks. The accuracy of the presented approach is illustrated for individual steel members and non-redundant and redundant benchmark steel frames from the literature. In all the considered cases, the presented method is verified against the results obtained from nonlinear finite element modelling.

The discussion is restricted to simple-span, right bridges consisting of a slab of constant thickness supported on five girders, spaced equidistantly, and having equal <b>flexural</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> but no torsional stiffness. The numerous variables influencing the behavior of this type of structure are listed, and the effects of the following are considered in detail: (i) the relative stiffness of girders and slab, H (2) the ratio of girder spacing to span of bridge, b/a; (7 /) the number and arrangement of the loads on the bridge; and (4) the effect of diaphragms, their stiffness, number, and location on the structure. Particular emphasis is placed on the relative magnitudes of the maximum moments in interior and exterior girders.

40|$|Abstract | Variable Angle Tow (VAT) {{placement}} {{allows the}} designer to tailor the composite structure {{to enhance the}} structural response under prescribed loading conditions. VAT technology allows curvilinear place-ment of tows within the plane of a structure and gives freedom for altering pointwise in-plane, coupling and <b>flexural</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> of a plate. This stiff-ness tailoring improves the buckling performance of VAT plates by allow-ing re-distribution of loads from the critical regions of the plate. In the present work, the Differential Quadrature Method (DQM) is investigated for performing buckling analysis of VAT panels. The governing differential equations are derived for the in-plane and buckling analysis of symmetric VAT plate structure based on classical laminated plate theory. DQM was applied to solve the buckling problem of simply supported VAT plates sub-jected to uniform edge compression. To show the accuracy and robust-ness of DQM, the results obtained using DQM are compared with finite element analysis. In this work, Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) curves are used to model the fibre path and the fibre orientation can be designed by modifying the control points within {{the domain of the}} plate. The NURBS representation allows general fibre angle variation of tow resulting in wider design space of VAT panels. Also, the number of design variables for VAT panels are reduced by using NURBS curves and the fibre manufacturing constraints can be handled easily. Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been coupled with DQM to determine the optimal tow path for improving the buckling performance...|$|R

This reveals that it may be a poor assumption to use continuous fiber reinforced plastics for emerging applications in large telescopes. Previous work [Ref. 2] shows that out of plane surface deformations in π/n laminates, where n= 3, 4, and 6, lead to unacceptable surface waviness hindering diffraction-limited performance required in precision optics. Within the industry, it is believed that high surface frequency due to fiber print-through can be eliminated by applying sufficient resin rich layer of more than 10 -mil [Ref. 6]. In this paper, the effects of resin thickness of 5 -mil up to 20 -mil on the surface of a π/ 4 laminate were evaluated to quantify the magnitude of surface undulations. Also, the applicability of various graded and intermediate resin material properties are performed to determine which variables have the most positive influence on the surface deformations and to see feasibility of various mitigation techniques for fiber print-through. Numerical results show that the increased resin buffer layers have more adverse effects on surface quality of the composite mirror, particularly in variable environment conditions. Experiments on a π/ 4 quasi-isotropic laminate fabricated from Bennett Optic Research (BOR) are performed to explore actual surface qualities of the quasi-isotropic mirror. The experimental results reveal that the unfavorable sinusoidal surface undulations identified in previous work [Ref. 2] do exist and that radial variations are more dramatic in the angular orientations ± 15 º from one of the defined lamina orientations.
