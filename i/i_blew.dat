Although the defense teams in both McVeigh's and Nichols trials suggested that others were involved, Judge Steven W. Taylor found no credible, relevant, or legally admissible evidence, of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing. When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing, he replied: [...] "You can't handle the truth! Because the truth is, <b>I</b> <b>blew</b> up the Murrah Building, and isn't it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell?" [...] On the morning of McVeigh's execution a letter was released in which he had written [...] "For those die-hard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this, I turn the tables and say: Show me where I needed anyone else.

2500|$|By {{the time}} of the 1996 US Olympic Trials, he had also run a 100-meter dash best of 10.14seconds. He scored another {{personal}} record in the first round, running 10.02seconds, and progressed to the final with similar marks.

This was his best ever 100m placing, but he was disappointed with his performance: [...] "I had a mental breakdown and got called for a false start. <b>I</b> <b>blew</b> it". He fared better in the 200m and came second with a time of 20.03seconds, although he was some distance off the winner, Michael Johnson, who ran a world record time of 19.66seconds.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{the history}} of jazz, {{there have always been}} musicians who sought to combine it with {{classical}} music. Ebony Concerto is one {{in a long line of}} music from the twenties to the present day that seeks to do this. Herman said about the Concerto: [...] " [...] very delicate and a very sad piece." [...] Stravinsky felt that the jazz musicians would have a hard time with the various time signatures. [...] Saxophonist Flip Philips said, [...] "During the rehearsal [...] there was a passage I had to play there and I was playing it soft, and Stravinsky said 'Play it, here I am!' and <b>I</b> <b>blew</b> it louder and he threw me a kiss!" [...] In his own original way Stravinsky noticed the massive amount of smoking at the recording session: [...] "the atmosphere looked like Pernod clouded by water." [...] Ebony Concerto was performed live by the Herman band on March 25, 1946 at Carnegie Hall.|$|E
