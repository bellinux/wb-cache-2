In 1969, the limitations of Perception were explained by Minsky and Papert. Neural nets have been expanded by a variety of neuroscientists and psychologists. Churchland discusses neural nets in the context of facial coding. The example consisted of a bank teller who could not remember the face of a bank robber to provide a description. However, Churchland says the teller would likely recognize and discriminate the robber's face when she sees him again. This example contains not only the idea of neural nets, but also of vector coding.|$|E
5000|$|Kortge (1990) {{proposed}} a learning rule for training neural networks, called the 'novelty rule', to help alleviate catastrophic interference. As its name suggests, this rule helps the neural network to learn only {{the components of}} a new input that differ from an old input. Consequently, the novelty rule changes only the weights that were not previously dedicated to storing information, thereby reducing the overlap in representations at the hidden units. Thus, even when inputs are somewhat similar to another, dissimilar representations can be made at the hidden layer. In order to apply the novelty rule, during learning the input pattern {{is replaced by a}} novelty vector that represents the components that differ. The novelty vector for the first layer (<b>input</b> <b>units</b> to hidden units) is determined by taking the target pattern away from the current output of the network (the delta rule). For the second layer (hidden units to output units) the novelty vector is simply the activation of the hidden units that resulted from using the novelty vector as an input through the first layer. Weight changes in the network are computed by using a modified delta rule with the novelty vector replacing the activation value (sum of the inputs): ...|$|E
