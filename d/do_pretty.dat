Bell stated that S.H.I.E.L.D. would be depicted {{as it was in the}} second season, underground with small [...] "pockets" [...] of S.H.I.E.L.D. around the world, as following the release of [...] "we found we like our team ... as underdogs, as opposed to a giant, powerful, NSA organization that can <b>do</b> <b>pretty</b> much anything." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Break the Ice" [...] {{was written}} by Nate [...] "Danja" [...] Hills, Marcella [...] "Ms. Lago" [...] Araica, Keri Hilson, James Washington and {{produced}} by Danja. Spears started working with Danja in July 2006. He explained that the creative process was not difficult at first since he was [...] "left to <b>do</b> <b>pretty</b> much whatever I wanted to", and [...] "if she felt it, she was gonna ride with it. If she didn't, you’d see it in her face." [...] Spears began recording the track in Las Vegas in August 2006, while she was seven months pregnant with her second child, Jayden James. Recording continued at Spears' house in Los Angeles, California, three weeks after she gave birth. Hilson commented that [...] "She gave 150 percent. [...] I don’t know any other mother that would do that." [...] "Radar" [...] was originally planned to be released as the third single from Blackout, according to Ezekiel Lewis of The Clutch. [...] "Break the Ice" [...] was chosen as a single by a poll on Spears' official Jive Records website. On February 11, 2008, {{it was announced that}} the song had won, receiving a 39% of the total votes.|$|E
500|$|Before [...] "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily" [...] was broadcast, {{a promotional}} {{commercial}} aired on television that featured, among other things, {{the announcement that}} [...] "one of Springfield's most beloved will die" [...] and a snippet of {{a scene from the}} episode with the character Lenny, sitting in the speedway spectator stand, being hit by a car tire, giving the impression that he would be the one who would die. Many viewers of the commercial, including Speedway Motorsports, Inc. owned Lowe's Motor Speedway president Jerry Gappens, expressed their concern as it appeared the episode was parodying an actual incident that happened during a speedway race at Lowe's Motor Speedway in May 1999, in Charlotte, North Carolina, when flying debris in a crash killed three spectators. Gappens said that doing a parody of that was [...] "a real insensitive thing to <b>do,</b> <b>pretty</b> irresponsible. Obviously what might appear funny in L.A. or New York isn't funny here in Charlotte." [...] Lowe's Motor Speedway announced to WSOC-TV's Channel 9 Eyewitness News on February7,2000 that they were thinking of placing a complaint to the Fox Broadcasting Company. WCCB, the then-Fox affiliate in Charlotte, refused to continue showing the commercial for the episode. As a result, Fox distributed a new commercial to the affiliate on February 9 that did not contain the scene with Lenny.|$|E

"We <b>did</b> <b>pretty</b> well, John, notwithstanding," [...] {{answered}} my uncle, {{who had a}} strong attachment to the old black race, that once so generally filled all the menial stations of the country, as is apt {{to be the case}} with all gentlemen of fifty; [...] "we <b>did</b> <b>pretty</b> well, notwithstanding; Jaaf, however, never acted strictly as a body-servant, though he was my grandfather's own man." ...|$|R

500|$|Commentators commended {{the first}} half of [...] "Space Race". The A.V. Club {{columnist}} Todd VanDerWerff approved of several aspects of the episode—mainly its animation, character development, and dialogue. In his A grade review, VanDerWerff felt that the producers were playful with the concepts of space. [...] "Archer, of course, takes place in a weird blend of past and present," [...] he professed, [...] "but 'Space Race' goes {{out of its way to}} toss 'future' into the middle of that mix as well. There are so many jokes that come just from the characters hanging out in anti-gravity, for God's sake, including a ping pong paddle strategically covering Pam's breasts." [...] Commenting on the program's animation, The A.V. Club journalist thought that its emphasis on the convergence of various science fiction techniques resulted in aesthetically pleasing visuals. VanDerWerff stated, [...] "Everything about this one gleams, and it makes for an Archer that will almost certainly look great in HD." [...] Furthermore, he adulated the episode's dialogue, avouching that even the characters with very limited screen time were given opportunities to shine with humor. Although Marcos Canales of Screen Invasion opined that [...] "Space Race: Part I" [...] contained far too many one-liners and jokes, he praised the storyline and was keen to the character progression of Lana. [...] "Usually, she’s the best agent ISIS has and can <b>do</b> <b>pretty</b> much anything," [...] explained Canales, [...] "so putting her in a situation where she was not a bad ass gave the character some added depth which is something most animated shows don’t prioritize." [...] Cinema Blend's Jesse Carp—despite criticizing the show's [...] "nonsensical" [...] narrative—declared it to be hilarious.|$|E
500|$|In July 2006, {{she started}} working with Danja, who {{contacted}} songwriters such as Keri Hilson, Jim Beanz, Marcella Araica and Corte Ellis to work with him. The team wrote seven tracks for Spears: [...] "Gimme More", [...] "Break the Ice", [...] "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)", [...] "Hot as Ice", [...] "Perfect Lover", [...] "Outta This World" [...] and [...] "Get Back". Danja explained that the creative process was not difficult at first since he was [...] "left to <b>do</b> <b>pretty</b> much whatever I wanted to", and [...] "if she felt it, she was gonna ride with it. If she didn't, you'd see it in her face." [...] Hilson wrote [...] "Gimme More" [...] with Spears in mind after Danja played her the instrumental, saying, [...] "I just started singing, 'Give me, Give me' and added a little more in and just having fun and messing around really." [...] Spears began recording with them at Studio at the Palms in Las Vegas in August 2006, while she was seven months pregnant with Jayden James. Recording continued at Spears' house in Los Angeles, three weeks after she gave birth. Hilson commented that [...] "She gave 150 percent. [...] I don't know any other mother that would do that." [...] Danja added that despite all her problems in her personal life, [...] "As far as her work ethic, I haven't seen anybody come in like that {{and do what you}} go to do." [...] Regarding the sound of the album, he deemed it as bigger, more mature and [...] "a new Britney", explaining: [...] "I come from hip-hop, so it's underlined with , but I throw it down." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of his {{freshman}} year, Frazier recorded a team-high 34-inch vertical in Penn State's preseason workouts. He also matched the 2009 NBA Draft Combine record, and surpassed the event's best lane agility time. Frazier did not participate in Penn State's exhibition opener against Slippery Rock. Coach DeChellis said, [...] "Billy Oliver, Sasa , Tim Frazier, Jermaine Marshall, they haven't played in this yet, so it was important just to get out there." [...] In his first official appearance against Pennsylvania, Frazier added 2 points and 1 rebound in a scoreless performance. He was only allowed 8 minutes of play time. He scored his first points against Robert Morris the following contest, with a game-high 19 points off the bench. He shot 6-of-11 from the field, and 4-of-5 on three-pointers. Frazier also contributed 3 assists, 2 rebounds, and 1 steal in 30 minutes on the court. DeChellis said, [...] "(Tim) is a hard guy to contain. If he starts making perimeter shots, then we're that much better. We've seen him where he can make shots in practice and <b>do</b> <b>pretty</b> well. We just needed to get him some confidence and get him into the flow." [...] The game would remain a season-high for him under the scoring category. Frazier was awarded his first start as a shooting guard on November 22, 2009 against Davidson; he registered 7 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists, and 3 steals. He recorded a season-high 34 minutes. He finished the 2009–10 season averaging 5.0 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 0.7 steals, and 1.7 turnovers. He played in all 31 regular season games.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of this sudden bit of {{inspiration}} when working on her next album, Amos requested that Lamb shoot additional footage for this project instead, forming the idea for a complementary [...] "road chronicle" [...] that would accompany Abnormally Attracted to Sin. Amos also stated that viewing the 2007 footage directly inspired her to write some of the songs. That the original footage dates back to the previous album period can observed in the video clips as Amos' fashion, styling and appearance {{is the same as the}} artwork and promotion during the release and tour supporting American Doll Posse. [...] The footage was shot in HD and Super 8. Seemingly inspired more by fashion, scenery and art, rather than by silent films or typical music videos, The Road Chronicles is composed of 16 vignettes in which Amos can be seen in dream-sequences infused with myriad metaphors, symbols, images, locations and haute couture fashion-pieces, meant to evoke and open up the themes and experiences tackled on each of the corresponding album songs. Commenting on not pursuing a more traditional form of music videos, Amos stated: [...] "I began to really think about the idea of a story being told through the visuals and yet the song itself giving us all the information – that’s our dialogue. I didn’t want any lip-syncing." [...] About the look of the visualettes, Amos has said: [...] "We wanted to <b>do</b> <b>pretty</b> much 8mm and more of a late ‘60’s, indie kind of feeling and that began the visualette world." ...|$|E
