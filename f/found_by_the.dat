More than 55% of the epigraphical inscriptions (about 55,000) <b>found</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Archaeological Survey of India are in the Tamil language. Tamil language inscriptions written in Brahmi script have been discovered in Sri Lanka, and on trade goods in Thailand and Egypt.

5|$|Beetle remains bearing what {{appeared}} to be the marks of bird attacks have been <b>found</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> River Ouse and hardened adults often bear symmetrically indented elytra, interpreted as 'pinch marks' inflicted by a beak whilst newly emerged adults are still hardening. Dead beetles have also been found in the webs of spiders in a captive population. The accidental predation of C. graminis by livestock consuming the tansy plant is also possible. Predation of a larva by the scorpionfly Panorpa germanica has been observed in the field. The tachinid genus Macquartia exclusively parasitizes Chrysolmelid beetles and one species of which, Macquartia dispar, may parasitise C. graminis directly. The adult fly deposits fully incubated eggs or newly hatched larvae into the vicinity of the host larvae.|$|E
5|$|Castiel gets {{a job at}} a {{gas station}} and {{attempts}} to adjust to his new life as a human. He helps Dean hunt a rogue angel that is killing people in emotional pain, but later prays for help when Dean sends him away for the second time on Ezekiel's orders.

Castiel and Muriel are taken to the anarchist angel Malachi, the leader of one side of the angel civil war (the other side being headed by the angel Bartholomew), and tortured for information on Metatron. Muriel is killed in the process.|$|E

This negotiation did much to secure further peace with the Native Americans in the area.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Catawissa Creek was <b>found</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission {{to have good}} {{temperatures}} for trout habitation, {{but there was no}} aquatic life in the creek due to acid mine drainage.

Several other tributaries, namely Dark Run, Davis Run, Little Catawissa Creek, and Messers Run are designated as high-quality cold water fisheries.|$|E
