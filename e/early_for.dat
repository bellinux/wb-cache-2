5|$|Along with {{single-seater}} racing, Rindt took up {{sports car}} racing in the mid-1960s. Rindt {{started at the}} 24 Hours of Le Mans {{a total of four}} times. At his debut in 1964, sharing a Ferrari 250LM with David Piper, the car retired too <b>early</b> <b>for</b> Rindt even to take the wheel.|$|E
5|$|Camera crews spent 10 {{days from}} November 5–18, 2005 to film {{sequences}} that would involve intense visual effects so Sony Pictures Imageworks could begin {{work on the}} shots early in the project.

5|$|Bradley {{declared}} his candidacy <b>early</b> <b>for</b> the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1895, and no real challenger emerged {{prior to the}} Republicans' nominating convention. Consequently, Bradley was nominated in a relatively harmonious convention. The major issue of the campaign was whether the country should maintain a monetary system based on the gold standard or allow the coinage of silver {{at a ratio of}} 16 to 1, commonly called the free silver position. At their convention, the Republicans adopted a platform that was unequivocally in favor of the gold standard.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 Fleming {{enrolled}} at Eton College. Although not a high achiever academically, he excelled at athletics {{and held the}} title of Victor Ludorum ("Winner of the Games") for two years between 1925 and 1927. He also edited a school magazine, The Wyvern. His lifestyle at Eton brought him into conflict with his housemaster, E. V. Slater, who disapproved of Fleming's attitude, his hair oil, his ownership of a car and his relations with women. Slater persuaded Fleming's mother to remove him from Eton a term <b>early</b> <b>for</b> a crammer course to gain entry to the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. He spent {{less than a year}} there, leaving in 1927 without gaining a commission, after contracting gonorrhea.|$|E

To remedy the problem, Michael leaves work <b>early</b> <b>for</b> a late night job as a telemarketer until 1 a.m. When Ryan finds out, he forces Michael to quit, who then fears {{that there is no}} way in which he can support Jan and himself. He hops a train to run away, but Jan meets him and tells him that they can work together to find a way to live. Meanwhile, Dwight pines over Angela, who is later asked out by Andy. After a pep-talk by Jim, Dwight returns as his normal annoying self, to Jim's pleasure. Pam and Jim visit Dwight's family farm, which he has fashioned into a bed and breakfast.|$|E
5|$|Of all the draft-eligible juniors, Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, Adrian Hubbard, Cyrus Kouandjio, Jeoffrey Pagan and Vinnie Sunseri {{declared}} their {{eligibility for}} the 2014 NFL Draft. At {{the time of}} their announcement, Clinton-Dix and Kouandjio were projected to be first-round picks and both Hubbard and Pagan were projected to be no lower than third-round picks. With their departures it marked the first time during the Saban era that more than three juniors declared <b>early</b> <b>for</b> the NFL Draft. In February 2014, twelve Alabama players, seven seniors and five juniors, were invited to the NFL Scouting Combine. The invited players were offensive linemen Cyrus Kouandjio and Anthony Steen, safeties Ha Ha Clinton-Dix and Vinnie Sunseri, linebackers Adrian Hubbard and C. J. Mosley, defensive ends Jeoffrey Pagan and Ed Stinson, quarterback AJ McCarron, wide receiver Kevin Norwood, cornerback Deion Belue and punter Cody Mandell.|$|E

5|$|The first final of the UEFA European Football Championship (then {{referred}} to as the European Nations' Cup Final) was contested in July 1960 in Paris between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Milan Galić scored for Yugoslavia just before half-time but Slava Metreveli equalised soon after the break, and the scores remained level, sending the game into extra time. With seven minutes left, Viktor Ponedelnik won the match for the Soviet Union, scoring the winner with a header. The 1960 champions qualified for the final of the 1964 tournament, where they faced hosts Spain. Jesús María Pereda scored <b>early</b> <b>for</b> the home side, but the match was levelled two minutes later when Galimzyan Khusainov equalised. Nearly 80,000 spectators at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid had to wait for the winner which came six minutes from time, courtesy of a header from Spaniard Marcelino.|$|E

Vanuatuan dignitaries, including the head of state, prime minister, and the minister of sports, also accompanied the team to attend the opening ceremony on August 8. Table tennis player Priscila Tommy and athlete Moses Kamut, the other two Vanuatuan qualifiers, did not accompany the Vanuatuan delegation to Beijing. Tommy arrived in China <b>early</b> <b>for</b> training, while Kamut spent time in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|After {{announcing his}} plans for the World Coal Center, Wilkinson began {{attending}} meetings of the Lexington Urban City Council, where he advocated his fiscally conservative political views. He was an admirer of Ronald Reagan, although he said he wished Reagan was a Democrat like himself. In 1979, Wilkinson became involved with Terry McBrayer's campaign against John Y. Brown, Jr. in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. He held a critical fundraiser for Scotty Baesler's 1981 Lexington mayoral campaign, although most of the businessmen in Lexington favored Baesler's opponent. In the 1983 Democratic gubernatorial primary, he served as finance chairman for Harvey Sloane's campaign. When Sloane lost a close race to Lieutenant Governor Martha Layne Collins, Republican nominee Jim Bunning tried to enlist the support of Sloane and his supporters, including Wilkinson. After a month of consideration, however, Wilkinson endorsed the entire Democratic ticket. The following year, he managed former governor Brown's brief senatorial campaign. Already considering running for governor in 1987, Wilkinson had hoped to remove Brown as a potential competitor for that office by helping him get elected to the Senate, but Brown ended his campaign <b>early</b> <b>for</b> health reasons. Through his work in various the campaigns, Wilkinson found that he enjoyed the challenges of competing in the political arena. He lobbied the General Assembly to pass a multi-bank holding company bill allowing banking companies to own more than one Kentucky bank. The bill passed in 1984.|$|E

5|$|Audi's No. 8 car made a {{pit stop}} for tyres, fuel and a {{replacement}} rear spoiler. The safety car {{went into the}} pit lane after 24 minutes and racing resumed with Jarvis leading the field back up to speed. Lamy passed François Perrodo's No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari at Rivage corner {{to take over the}} LMGTE Am lead. Patrick Long in the No. 88 Abu Dhabi Proton Racing car overtook Perrodo at Les Comes to take over second position in the same category. Fässler closed the gap to Heidfeld in the No. 12 Rebellion Racing vehicle but was spun by Albuquerque's RGR Sport car after moving in front of the vehicle upon lapping it at La Source resulting in heavy damage to the No. 7 Audi car's front-end, littering debris on the track. This was partly because Fässler braked <b>early</b> <b>for</b> the corner due to slower cars. Baxi DC Racing's No. 35 Alpine and the Abu Dhabi's No. 88 Porsche made heavy contact causing the former to sustain a right-rear puncture, littering the track with debris on the Kemmel Straight, and stopping {{on the side of the}} track. Calado's engine failed which prevented him from clinching victory in LMGTE Pro and he went into his garage to retire. Derani locked his tyres at La Source, allowing Lapierre to close the gap, and the French driver overtook Derani around the outside while lapping Franchitti's Ford GT at Fagnes to move into the LMP2 lead.|$|E
5|$|HMS Illustrious was {{the lead}} ship of her class of {{aircraft}} carriers built for the Royal Navy before World War II. Her first assignment after completion and working up was with the Mediterranean Fleet, in which her aircraft's most notable achievement was sinking one Italian battleship and badly damaging two others during the Battle of Taranto in late 1940. Two months later the carrier was crippled by German dive bombers and was repaired in the United States. After sustaining damage on the voyage home in late 1941 by a collision with her sister ship , Illustrious {{was sent to the}} Indian Ocean in early 1942 to support the invasion of Vichy French Madagascar (Operation Ironclad). After returning home in early 1943, the ship was given a lengthy refit and briefly assigned to the Home Fleet. She was transferred to Force H for the Battle of Salerno in mid-1943 and then rejoined the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean at the beginning of 1944. Her aircraft attacked several targets in the Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies over the following year before Illustrious was transferred to the newly formed British Pacific Fleet (BPF). The carrier participated {{in the early stages of}} the Battle of Okinawa until mechanical defects arising from accumulated battle damage became so severe that she was ordered home <b>early</b> <b>for</b> repairs in May 1945.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Buemi was the fastest driver with a lap time of {{one minute and}} 2.164 seconds; Di Grassi and Vergne were one-tenth of a second behind in second and third. Heidfeld placed fourth; Abt was fifth-fastest and Piquet sixth. Engel was seventh-fastest, António Félix da Costa eighth, Turvey ninth and Duval completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. During the session, where teams assessed their car's thermal management {{in preparation for the}} race, Bird and Piquet locked their tyres and went off into the turn one run-off area, while Abt stopped on the start/finish straight but was able to restart his car. Duval and Frijns spun within moments of each other. López lost control of his car at the final chicane, and later heavily damaged his vehicle's front-right corner in the session's closing minutes by steering too <b>early</b> <b>for</b> turn 14 and collided with the barrier. The fastest 13 drivers were covered by under one second, indicating there would be a tightly-contested midfield battle.|$|E

5|$|The 2000–01 season started <b>early</b> <b>for</b> Bradford after {{chairman}} Geoffrey Richmond {{decided to}} enter the Intertoto Cup. Wetherall did not play in the team's first game away at FK Atlantas, and after playing in the second leg and the two third-round games, he missed the semi-final with Zenit St Petersburg because of an ankle injury. Bradford subsequently lost both legs. Wetherall started the league season but after playing all 52 league games since joining Bradford without leaving the field, Wetherall limped off before half-time during a 2–0 defeat to their nearest rivals Derby County in November 2000. Days after new manager Jim Jefferies took over, Wetherall was ruled out until the following February following a groin operation. His first game back was on 24 February 2001 as Bradford lost 2–1 to West Ham United. His return to league action lasted just four games when, after scoring in a 2–2 draw with Newcastle United, he was ruled out {{for the rest of}} the season with a recurrence of the groin injury.
