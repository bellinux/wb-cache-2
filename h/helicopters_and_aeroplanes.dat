40|$|Mosquitoes exhibit unusual wing kinematics; their long, slender wings flap at remarkably high {{frequencies}} for their size (> 800 [*]Hz) and with lower stroke amplitudes {{than any other}} insect group 1. This shifts weight support away from the translation-dominated, aerodynamic mechanisms used by most insects 2, {{as well as by}} <b>helicopters</b> <b>and</b> <b>aeroplanes,</b> towards poorly understood rotational mechanisms that occur when pitching {{at the end of each}} half-stroke. Here we report free-flight mosquito wing kinematics, solve the full Navier–Stokes equations using computational fluid dynamics with overset grids, and validate our results with in vivo flow measurements. We show that, although mosquitoes use familiar separated flow patterns, much of the aerodynamic force that supports their weight is generated in a manner unlike any previously described for a flying animal. There are three key features: leading-edge vortices (a well-known mechanism that appears to be almost ubiquitous in insect flight), trailing-edge vortices caused by a form of wake capture at stroke reversal, and rotational drag. The two new elements are largely independent of the wing velocity, instead relying on rapid changes in the pitch angle (wing rotation) at the end of each half-stroke, and they are therefore relatively immune to the shallow flapping amplitude. Moreover, these mechanisms are particularly well suited to high aspect ratio mosquito wings...|$|E

40|$|Radio {{telemetry}} {{has been}} widely used to study the space use and movement behaviour of vertebrates, but transmitter sizes have only recently become small enough to allow tracking of insects under natural field conditions. Here, we review the available literature on insect telemetry using active (battery-powered) radio transmitters and compare this technology to harmonic radar and radio frequency identification (RFID) which use passive tags (i. e. without a battery). The first radio telemetry studies with insects {{were published in the}} late 1980 s, and subsequent studies have addressed aspects of insect ecology, behaviour and evolution. Most insect telemetry studies have focused on habitat use and movement, including quantification of movement paths, home range sizes, habitat selection, and movement distances. Fewer studies have addressed foraging behaviour, activity patterns, migratory strategies, or evolutionary aspects. The majority of radio telemetry studies have been conducted outside the tropics, usually with beetles (Coleoptera) and crickets (Orthoptera), but bees (Hymenoptera), dobsonflies (Megaloptera), and dragonflies (Odonata) have also been radio-tracked. In contrast to the active transmitters used in radio telemetry, the much lower weight of harmonic radar and RFID tags allows them to be used with a broader range of insect taxa. However, the fixed detection zone of a stationary radar unit (< 1 km diameter) and the restricted detection distance of RFID tags (usually < 1 - 5 m) constitute major constraints of these technologies compared to radio telemetry. Most of the active transmitters in radio telemetry have been applied to insects with a body mass exceeding 1 g, but smaller species in the range 0. 2 - 0. 5 g (e. g. bumblebees and orchid bees) have now also been tracked. Current challenges of radio-tracking insects in the field are related to the constraints of a small transmitter, including short battery life (7 - 21 days), limited tracking range on the ground (100 - 500 m), and a transmitter weight that sometimes approaches the weight of a given insect (the ratio of tag mass to body mass varies from 2 to 100 %). The attachment of radio transmitters may constrain insect behaviour and incur significant energetic costs, but few studies have addressed this in detail. Future radio telemetry studies should address (i) a larger number of species from different insect families and functional groups, (ii) a better coverage of tropical regions, (iii) intraspecific variability between sexes, ages, castes, and individuals, and (iv) a larger tracking range via aerial surveys with <b>helicopters</b> <b>and</b> <b>aeroplanes</b> equipped with external antennae. Furthermore, field and laboratory studies, including observational and experimental approaches as well as theoretical modelling, could help to clarify the behavioural and energetic consequences of transmitter attachment. Finally, the development of commercially available systems for automated tracking and potential future options of insect telemetry from space will provide exciting new avenues for quantifying movement and space use of insects from local to global spatial scales...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} aerodynamic optimisation of tiltrotor blades with high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics. The employed optimisation {{framework is}} based on a quasi-Newton method, and the required high-fidelity flow gradients were computed using a discrete adjoint solver. Single-point optimisations were first performed, to highlight the contrasting requirements of the <b>helicopter</b> <b>and</b> <b>aeroplane</b> flight regimes. It is then shown how a trade-off blade design can be obtained using a multi-point optimisation strategy. The parametrisation of the blade shape allowed to modify the twist and chord distributions, and to introduce a swept tip. The work shows how these main blade shape parameters influence the optimal performance of the tiltrotor in <b>helicopter</b> <b>and</b> <b>aeroplane</b> modes, <b>and</b> how a compromise blade shape can increase the overall tiltrotor performance. Moreover, in all the presented cases, the accuracy of the adjoint gradients resulted in a small number of flow evaluations for finding the optimal solution, thus indicating gradient-based optimisation as a viable tool for modern tiltrotor design...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{aerodynamic}} blade design of a tiltwing aircraft with a multi-objective optimization procedure. The aerodynamic design of tiltrotor blades is a very challenging task in the project of this type of aircraft. Design/methodology/approach - Tiltrotor blades have to give good performance both in <b>helicopter</b> <b>and</b> <b>aeroplane</b> modes. According to the design parameters (the chords, the twists and the airfoils along the blade), as the optimization objectives are different from one operating condition to another, the blade is the result of a multi-objective constrained optimization based on a controlled elitist genetic algorithm founded on the NSGA-II algorithm. The optimization process uses a BEMT solver to compute rotor performance. To avoid negative effects due to compressibility losses in aeroplane mode, the blade shape has been refined following the normal Mach number criterion. Findings - It has been found that the optimized rotor blade gives good performance both in terms of figure of merit and propulsive efficiency if compared with experimental data of existing rotor (ERICA tiltrotor) and propeller (NACA high-speed propeller). Practical implications - The optimization procedure described in this paper for the design of tiltrotor blades can be efficiently used for the aerodynamic design of <b>helicopter</b> rotors <b>and</b> aircraft propellers of all typology. Originality/value - In this work, advanced methodologies have been used for the aerodynamics design of a proprotor optimized for an aircraft which belongs to the innovative typology of high-performance tiltwing tiltrotor aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Hummingbirds are {{the only}} birds that can sustain hovering. This unique flight {{behaviour}} comes, however, at high energetic cost. Based on <b>helicopter</b> <b>and</b> <b>aeroplane</b> design theory, we expect that hummingbird wing aspect ratio (AR), which ranges from about 3. 0 to 4. 5, determines aerodynamic efficacy. Previous quasi-steady experiments with a wing spinner set-up provide no support for this prediction. To test this more carefully, we compare the quasi-steady hover performance of 26 wings, from 12 hummingbird taxa. We spun the wings at angular velocities and angles of attack that are representative for every species and measured lift and torque more precisely. The power (aerodynamic torque × angular velocity) required to lift weight depends on aerodynamic efficacy, which {{is measured by the}} power factor. Our comparative analysis shows that AR has a modest influence on lift and drag forces, as reported earlier, but interspecific differences in power factor are large. During the downstroke, the power required to hover decreases for larger AR wings at the angles of attack at which hummingbirds flap their wings (p < 0. 05). Quantitative flow visualization demonstrates that variation in hover power among hummingbird wings is driven by similar stable leading edge vortices that delay stall during the down- and upstroke. A side-by-side aerodynamic performance comparison of hummingbird wings and an advanced micro helicopter rotor shows that they are remarkably similar...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{evidence on}} the ability of grid-based, Computational Fluid Dynamics methods based on the Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations to accurately predict axial flight performance of rotors with modest computer resources. Three well-studied blades, the B 0 - 105, S- 76, and PSP main rotor blades, are used and results are compared with experimental data. Likewise, performance analyses of the JORP propeller and XV- 15 tiltrotor blades are carried out, respectively, aiming to validate the employed CFD method for such relevant flows. Validation of the HMB 3 CFD solver for complete tiltrotors is also presented. The aim is to assess the capability of the present CFD method in predicting tiltrotor airloads at different flight configurations. In this regard, three representative cases of the ERICA tiltrotor were selected, corresponding to <b>aeroplane,</b> transition corridor, <b>and</b> <b>helicopter</b> modes, covering most modes of tiltrotor flight. Aerodynamic optimisation of tiltrotor blades with high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics coupled with a discrete adjoint method is also carried out. This work shows how the main blade shape parameters influence the optimal performance of the tiltrotor in <b>helicopter</b> <b>and</b> <b>aeroplane</b> modes, <b>and</b> how a compromise blade shape can increase the overall tiltrotor performance. Finally, the implementation and validation of an efficient, high-order, finite-volume scheme (up to 4 th-order of spatial accuracy) in the HMB 3 CFD solver is presented. The scheme shows a higher level of accuracy if compared with the standard-MUSCL, and 4 th-order accuracy was achieved on Cartesian grids. Furthermore, a significantly high spectral resolution (dispersion and dissipation) of the new scheme is observed. Two-and three-dimensional test cases were considered to demonstrate the new formulation. Results of the steady flow around the 7 AD, S- 76, JORP propeller, and XV- 15 blades showed a better preservation of the vorticity and higher resolution of the vortical structures compared with the standard MUSCL solution. The method was also demonstrated for three-dimensional unsteady flows using overset and moving grid computations for the UH- 60 A rotor in forward flight and the ERICA tiltrotor in aeroplane mode. For medium grids, the new high-order scheme adds CPU and memory overheads of 22...|$|R
