25|$|Fairly {{straightforward}} statistics provide {{estimates of}} whether associations between genes on lists {{are greater than}} what one would expect by chance. These statistics are interesting, even if they represent a substantial oversimplification of what is really <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> <b>Here</b> is an example. Suppose there are 10,000 genes in an experiment, only 50 (0.5%) of which play a known role in making cholesterol. The experiment identifies 200 regulated genes. Of those, 40 (20%) {{turn out to be}} on a list of cholesterol genes as well. Based on the overall prevalence of the cholesterol genes (0.5%) one expects an average of 1 cholesterol gene for every 200 regulated genes, that is, 0.005 times 200. This expectation is an average, so one expects to see more than one some of the time. The question becomes how often we would see 40 instead of 1 due to pure chance.|$|E
500|$|Known for his fearlessness in {{assisting}} runaway slaves, Coffin {{served as a}} role model who encouraged his neighbors to help contribute to the effort, although many were wary of providing them with a safe haven in their homes as he and his wife did. Best known for his leadership in aiding fugitive slaves, Coffin was first referred to as the unofficial [...] "President of the Underground Railroad" [...] by a slavecatcher who said, [...] "There's an underground railroad <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>here,</b> and Levi's the president of it." [...] The informal title became commonly used among other abolitionists and some ex-slaves.|$|E
500|$|Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph {{was more}} {{critical}} with the episode, stating, [...] "having {{set up an}} interesting cliffhanger last week, it was a tad annoying that Steven Moffat did his trick again of taking a swerve with the pre-credits section of this week's episode, and more supposed shock value with the shootings of Amy and Rory," [...] but also more annoyed [...] "that what exactly was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>here,</b> {{and how it was}} influenced by the events of the previous episode, were never exactly explained, leaving the audience to fill in the blanks." [...] Fuller believed that the plot and ending [...] "only raised more questions than answers," [...] believing that the overarching storyline would [...] "require the audience's concentration over many weeks; any casual viewer tuning in this week, and I suspect not a few fans, will have been left baffled by the goings-on," [...] but still felt the episode [...] "was interesting and showed just how, when the writers use their imagination, Doctor Who can tell stories in a way little else on television can." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{contemporary}} reviews, Peter Paphides {{wrote in}} Melody Maker that the EP was [...] "25 minutes of snowblind glory waiting {{here if you}} want them. Each {{of them is a}} towering monument to nothingness". The Alternative Press opined that the EP was not [...] "a progression from the gorgeously devastated Frigid Stars and I couldn't be happier. Codeine have hit upon a formula so pure and righteous it would be tragic for them to deviate from it." [...] The Washington Post gave the album a mixed review, explaining that [...] "There's not a lot <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>here,</b> but songs such as [...] "Realize" [...] and [...] "Hard to Find" [...] are hardly nothing." [...] and that tracks such as [...] "W." [...] allow Codeine to achieve [...] "both earthly aggression and unearthly calm." [...] Charles Aaron of Spin, reviewed the single [...] "Realize", stating that the song [...] "inches along as if Codeine's still wondering whether it's worth the effort". The b-side [...] "Broken-hearted Wine" [...] was described as a song that [...] "coolly walks a delicate line between delibitating sadness and cartoon regret." ...|$|E
500|$|Cool World {{opened at}} sixth on the North American box office, with $5.5 million. Its {{lifetime}} gross was $14.1 million, {{a little more}} than half its reported $28 million budget. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes collected a sample of 45 reviews and judged 4% of them to be positive. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that Cool World [...] "misses one opportunity after another", describing it as [...] "a surprisingly incompetent film". Deseret News reviewer Chris Hicks described it as [...] "a one-joke movie – and it's a dirty joke. [...] And much of what's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>here</b> seems more angry and nasty than inspired or funny." [...] Variety reviewer Brian Lowry compared the film to an extended music video, praising the soundtrack and visuals, but panning the story. Leonard Maltin described the film as [...] "too serious to be fun [...] too goofy to take seriously", and the lead characters as [...] "unlikable and unappealing". The Washington Post reviewer Hal Hinson wondered [...] "whether Kim Basinger is more obnoxious as a cartoon or as a real person," [...] and felt that the combination of animation and live action was unconvincing. Contributing to the low box office was the fact the studio withdrew all advertising support after the opening weekend.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic praised the song {{as one of}} the best tracks of the album, calling it [...] "infectious". Sean O'Brien from The People praised [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] as [...] "the best song of the album" [...] and her [...] "one of her best ever". He also said that the song is one of the reasons why Madonna is queen of pop. Jon Pareles from The New York Times considered it as the album's most danceable song. Lucy O'Brien in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, called the song [...] "dazed-sounding". Metro Times described Ahmadzai's programming as [...] "by far the best thing on the album". James Hannaham from Spin compared [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] to Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love", and deemed it as a highlight from the album. Alan Braidwood from BBC Music felt that the song was [...] "insane" [...] with its electronic, chaotic, fast and manic pounding synths. [...] "There is so much <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>here</b> several it'll take several plays to really get it, but it's ace." [...] Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly described [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] as the [...] "downright thrilling" [...] and [...] "deploys a shrewd little form-versus-content paradox".|$|E

500|$|The teams {{moved to}} Headingley for the Fourth Test at Leeds. Hutton was {{recalled}} {{and the home}} team won the toss and batted first. England tallied 496, its highest score of the series. Miller took the last wicket of Yardley to finish with 1/43. Generally unthreatening throughout the innings, he bowled only 17.1 overs; the other frontline bowlers sent down at least 33 each. The innings started badly for Miller. He bowled below his full pace and his opening over yielded three full tosses. In Miller's first over, Hutton scored the first boundary of the day, driving past mid-off. He felt his legs for muscle strains, and after two overs that O'Reilly described as [...] "very innocuous", Miller was taken off. Nursing fitness concerns, Miller was forced to bowl medium-paced off breaks {{on the second day}} as England proceeded to 2/423 and appeared to be in complete control, before losing 8/73. In reply, Australia was struggling at 3/68 on the third morning. Neil Harvey—playing his first Ashes Test—joined Miller at the crease. Both had walked out in the same over, as Pollard removed Bradman and Hassett in the space of three balls. Australia was more than 400 behind, and if England were to remove the pair quickly, they would expose Australia's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to win by taking a hefty first innings lead. Harvey asked his senior partner [...] "What’s <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>here,</b> eh? Let's get stuck into 'em". The pair launched a counterattack, with Miller taking the lead. He hoisted Laker's first ball over square leg for six. Miller shielded the left-handed Harvey from Laker, as his partner was struggling against the off breaks that were turning away from him, especially one that spun, bounced, and beat his outside edge. The all rounder drilled one off-drive from Laker for four, and after mis-hitting the next to the amusement of the crowd, struck the off spinner flat over his head, almost for six into the sightscreen. This allowed Australia to seize the initiative, and Harvey joined in during the next over. The left-hander hit consecutive boundaries against Laker, the second of which almost cleared the playing area. He followed this with another boundary to reach 44. Miller then lifted Laker for a six over long off, hitting a spectator in the head, and another over long on from Yardley's bowling to move from 42 to 54. He drove the next ball through cover for four. Yardley responded by stacking his leg side with outfielders and bowling outside leg stump, challenging Miller to another hit for six. The batsman attempted to oblige, but insteadedged the ball onto wicket-keeper Evans' head; Edrich dived forward and caught the ball on the rebound at short fine leg. The crowd was in raptures at both the batting and Edrich's catch.|$|E
2500|$|AIDS {{was seen}} as a disease of gay, White, North American men. And people were really afraid of it. There were no {{treatments}} available in the Caribbean at the time, so AIDS really was a death sentence. You had people with Kaposi's sarcoma, people with violent diarrhea, who were just wasting away and then dying in really horrible and traumatic ways. To call what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>here</b> [...] "stigma and discrimination" [...] was really an understatement. In the ghettos they were putting tires around people who had AIDS and lighting the tires on fire. They were killing gay people because they thought AIDS was contagious. It was a very extreme environment, and really horrible things were happening.|$|E
2500|$|One of Crosby's songwriting {{contributions}} to the album, [...] "What's Happening?!?!", began his penchant for writing abstract songs asking irresoluble questions, a trend that has continued throughout his career with Crosby, Stills & Nash and as a solo artist. During a 1966 interview, Crosby admitted {{that it was a}} strange song, noting [...] "It asks questions of what's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>here</b> and who does it all belong to and why is it all going on. I just ask the questions because I really don't know the answers." [...] Like [...] "Eight Miles High", the song exhibits the strong influence of Indian classical music with its droning guitar and melody. [...] "What's Happening?!?!" [...] is also notable for being the first song written solely by Crosby to appear on a Byrds' record.|$|E

The union's constitution required the convention to be held in May, but AFL leaders (including the influential Executive Council member, Matthew Woll) demanded that Shachtman delay the meeting until such time as he could guarantee that a large majority of delegates would be pro-AFL. [...] "As you well know, your International Union is today being financed to a great part by the reorganizing activities <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>here</b> in New York City," [...] Woll and two others wrote Shachtman, [...] "and that without this income your organization would be practically bankrupt."

2500|$|The script of [...] "Band of Brothers" [...] {{describes}} Darius as a monk with a [...] "hideously ugly face", {{but when}} the producers cast the part, they chose German actor Werner Stocker, who did not fit this description. Abramowitz explains, [...] "Darius, originally in the script, was written as almost {{to look like the}} Hunchback of Notre Dame, to be physically ugly and with a glorious soul. And when I got to France, I noticed that they cast this young, handsome German actor named Werner Stocker. I said, 'Wait a minute. What's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>here?</b> He's supposed to be ugly.' And it seemed that the Germans, who were putting up a great deal of money, didn't want the only German actor in the show to be ugly; so he wasn't ugly. And {{this was one of the}} cases where politics won out and it didn't hurt anything." ...|$|E

[...] The package contained a book titled Naming Your Baby along with a letter encouraging him to help decide on a name while there was still time. [...] As Smith flipped through the pages, a crowd of Marines formed around him, each of them urging him to look up their own names, and the names of their fathers, mothers, siblings, and girlfriends. [...] "While we were engaged in this incongruous diversion," [...] Smith wrote in his February 21, 1979 column, [...] "a photographer happened by and was curious. [...] What was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>here?</b> [...] He was sick of death, shock and horror and was looking for something upbeat. [...] Human interest. [...] A sign that life would go on."

5000|$|Several country stars {{declared}} {{their support}} for Beyoncé, including Dierks Bentley who said that [...] "Daddy Lessons" [...] is undoubtedly a country song: [...] "it's not just choruses and verses that could be intermixed anywhere as some pop songs are, it's a real story that she tells about what's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in <b>here</b> life growing up".

2500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{film critic}} Lisa Schwarzbaum gave Knight and Day a grade of [...] "C+", and {{compared}} it to the 2010 film Killers starring Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher, [...] "The producers assume that audience interest in movie stars is bigger than audience interest in characters. The conclusion is overdetermined, since Roy and June are such flimsy constructions. ... At least they're not Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher in Killers." [...] Colin Covert of Star Tribune made a similar comparison, [...] "The film looks unambitious, like a remake of 'Killers,' the Ashton Kutcher-Katherine Heigl guns-and-giggles toss-off everyone has already forgotten, but with bigger stunts and more star wattage." [...] The film received a rating of two stars out of four from critic Peter Howell in the Toronto Star; the reviewer commented, [...] "There {{is supposed to be}} romance in Knight and Day — and Diaz is up for it — but Cruise still looks as if he’s taken charisma lessons from Al Gore." [...] In a review for The Huffington Post, critic Marshall Fine observed, [...] "the movie bubbles happily for almost an hour before it flags". Robert Bell of Exclaim! wrote of the script, [...] "Sure, things slow down a bit around the midway point, making it clear that there is very little <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>here</b> aside from cheesy escapist fantasy, but things quickly pick up again, engaging us in the moment of a movie that knows exactly what mainstream trash cinema should be." [...] In a review for the Orlando Sentinel, critic Roger Moore commented, [...] "The blase plot devices (a gadget, the nerdy guy who invented it), the bland villains, the too-fast dash through exotic locales, don't matter so long as Cruise and Diaz click and spark their scenes – chases and embraces – to life. And Cruise, hurling himself at this as if his Mission: Impossible future and indeed his whole career depended on it, makes sure they do." ...|$|E
