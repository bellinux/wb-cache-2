5|$|Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and {{insecure}} man {{in private}} but adopted {{a warm and}} outgoing public persona. He had <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> and high expectations of those with whom he worked. Although there have been accusations that he was racist or anti-Semitic, they have been contradicted by many who knew him. His reputation changed {{in the years after}} his death, from a purveyor of homely patriotic values to a representative of American imperialism. He nevertheless remains an important figure in the history of animation and in the cultural history of the United States, where he is considered a national cultural icon. His film work continues to be shown and adapted; his studio maintains <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> in its production of popular entertainment, and the Disney amusement parks have grown in size and number to attract visitors in several countries.|$|E
5|$|Relative {{to their}} <b>high</b> <b>standards,</b> UConn {{struggled}} {{during the first}} two years following Taurasi's graduation in 2004. Some of its highly touted recruits did not play up to expectations while others suffered injuries. Taken together during the three years 2005–2007, UConn never made a Final Four, something that has become almost routine (17 final fours in 22 years from 1995 to 2016).|$|E

This can be seen in Copenhagen's University Library (1861) designed by Johan Daniel Herholdt and inspired by St Fermo's Church in Verona.|$|E
5|$|Attrition by 1942 {{had created}} a {{shortage}} of experienced combat leaders. No special training was made available for this role. Galland set up a course in late 1943, but it only lasted a few months. Galland {{was quoted as saying}} he thought they could learn the skills while on operations, as he had. This ignored his own talents, and blithely expected other pilots to reach his <b>high</b> <b>standards.</b>|$|E
5|$|During October, City also hosted an inter-league {{game between}} the English and Irish Leagues at Valley Parade. Although the ground was not up to <b>high</b> <b>standards,</b> the Football League was keen to {{encourage}} football in Bradford.

5|$|During the Edo period Noh {{continued}} to be aristocratic art form supported by the shogun, the feudal lords (daimyōs), as well as wealthy and sophisticated commoners. While kabuki and joruri popular {{to the middle class}} focused on new and experimental entertainment, Noh strived to preserve its established <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> and historic authenticity and remained mostly unchanged throughout the era. To capture the essence of performances given by great masters, every detail in movements and positions was reproduced by others, generally resulting in an increasingly slow, ceremonial tempo over time.|$|E

His success in One-day cricket was underlined by his {{rise to the}} top of the ICC ODI batting rankings in February 2004. However, he was unable to maintain this form on the 2004 tours of Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and the Champions Trophy in England, accumulating 253 runs at 28.11 in 11 innings.|$|E

5|$|Plant {{medicines}} {{can cause}} adverse effects and even death, whether by side-effects of their active substances, by adulteration or contamination, by overdose, or by inappropriate prescription. Many such effects are known, while others {{remain to be}} explored scientifically. There {{is no reason to}} presume that because a product comes from nature it must be safe: the existence of powerful natural poisons like atropine and nicotine shows this to be untrue. Further, the <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> applied to conventional medicines do not always apply to plant medicines, and dose can vary widely depending on the growth conditions of plants: older plants may be much more toxic than young ones, for instance.|$|E

5|$|The first dent to morale {{came after}} about a week when the volunteers were first issued ranks in the Rhodesian Army.

Some men who considered themselves to have been overlooked began to have problems with discipline. The brazen attitude of most of the company's soldiers jarred strongly with that of their Rhodesian commanders, who had <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> regarding presentation and dress which many of the Frenchmen had little inclination to meet.|$|E

She started a school for African-American girls in Daytona Beach, Florida. It later merged with a private institute for African-American boys, and was known as the Bethune-Cookman School. Bethune maintained <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> and promoted the school with tourists and donors, to demonstrate what educated African Americans could do.

5|$|Bruntwood Park has {{a variety}} of facilities, {{including}} orienteering, an 18-hole, par 3 pitch and putt golf course, children's play areas, football pitches, and a BMX track. Bruntwood Park is also home to The Bowmen of Bruntwood, Stockport's only archery club. Bruntwood Park is a Grade B Site of Biological Interest, and in 1999 was given a Green Flag Award for its <b>high</b> <b>standards.</b> The land it occupies was once a large estate, which at one time included a stud farm. Bruntwood Hall, a Victorian Gothic building constructed in 1861, has been used for various purposes, including serving as Cheadle and Gatley Town Hall from 1944 until 1959. It is now used as offices, and since the 1940s the park has been open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel began {{training}} his brigade {{upon arrival}} in Egypt. He was noted for insisting on <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> of dress and bearing from his troops. The 1st Light Horse Brigade {{became part of}} Major General Alexander Godley's New Zealand and Australian Division, along with the 4th Infantry Brigade, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. When {{the rest of the}} Australian and New Zealand Army Corps departed for Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, the mounted brigades remained in Egypt – the Gallipoli Peninsula being unsuited to mounted operations. Following heavy casualties {{in the early days of}} the Gallipoli Campaign, however, the light horse were called upon to provide 1,000reinforcements. The British commander in Egypt, Lieutenant General Sir John Maxwell, elected instead to ship the mounted brigades to Anzac Cove intact.|$|E

5|$|Internally at Rare, the Stamper {{brothers}} were demanding bosses {{who continued to}} work 15-hour days after transitioning into management roles. Chris Stamper continued to code for the company through the mid-90s, while also serving as Rare's chairman and technical director. Tim, the managing director, continued to work on graphics for the company, including backgrounds in Donkey Kong Country. Their younger brother, Stephen, also worked as Rare's operations director. The Stampers encouraged competition between the company's development teams and {{were involved in the}} decision-making on every game, even when the company expanded to several hundred employees. A group of employees left in 1997 to work for another Sony-focused studio, while another group left during production for the sequel to GoldenEye. Despite decent reviews, Rare's subsequent games did not appear to meet the <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> of their predecessors, and poor sales led to another staff exodus.|$|E
5|$|Lang became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1928. He {{presided over}} the 1930 Lambeth Conference, which gave limited church {{approval}} {{to the use of}} contraception. After denouncing the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 and strongly condemning European anti-semitism, Lang later supported the appeasement policies of the British government. In May 1937 he {{presided over the}} coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. On retirement in 1942 Lang was raised to the peerage as Baron Lang of Lambeth and continued to attend and speak in House of Lords debates until his death in 1945. Lang himself believed that he had not lived up to his own <b>high</b> <b>standards.</b> Others have praised his qualities of industry, his efficiency and his commitment to his calling.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the largest}} groups of {{surviving}} works of art are the seal matrices that appear to have entered Scottish usage with feudalism in the reign of David I, beginning at the royal court and among his Anglo-Norman vassals and then by about 1250 they began to spread to the Gaelicised areas of the country. They would be made compulsory for barons of the king in a statute of 1401 and seal matrices show very <b>high</b> <b>standards</b> of skill and artistry. Examples of items that were probably the work of continental artists include the delicate hanging lamp in St. John's Kirk in Perth, the vestments and hangings in Holyrood and the Medieval maces of the Universities of St Andrews and Glasgow.|$|E
