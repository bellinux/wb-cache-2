5|$|Ealdred had {{returned}} to England by 1055, and brought with him {{a copy of the}} Pontificale Romano-Germanicum, a set of liturgies, with him. An extant copy of this work, currently manuscript Cotton Vitellus E xii, has been identified as a copy owned by Ealdred. It appears likely that the Rule of Chrodegang, a continental set of ordinances for the communal life of secular canons, was introduced into England by Ealdred sometime before 1059. Probably <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> back from Germany, possibly in concert with Harold.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{three out}} of the serial's twelve episodes have been recovered. 16mm copies of episodes 5 and 10 were {{returned}} in the early 1980s, under unclear circumstances (with rumour claiming they {{were found in the}} basement of a Mormon church). Episode 2 was returned in 2004 by former BBC engineer Francis Watson. He had come across the film in the 1970s, while clearing a projector testing room at the BBC's Ealing Studios. Instead of disposing of the film as instructed, <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> home – eventually to return it to the Corporation when he realised the value of the material.|$|E
5|$|Producer Nancy Tenenbaum {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the short film. After she sent a copy of the original film to several people of interest, filmmaker Steven Soderbergh replied that he was interested and that he wanted to direct a remake. <b>He</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to the attention of Universal Studios who initially declined but subsequently optioned {{the rights to the}} film in 1995. Soderbergh took on the project but then dropped it when he got involved with Out of Sight.|$|E

5|$|The {{script for}} what was then known as Scary Movie went on sale on a Friday in June1995, but {{received}} no bids. By the following Monday, the script had become {{the subject of a}} significant bidding war among a host of established studios, including Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, and Morgan Creek Productions. Producer Cathy Konrad read the script and felt it was exactly what the Weinstein brothers of the fledgling Dimension Films — then a part of Miramax — were looking for. Dimension had previously released several horror films and intended to focus on that genre. Konrad brought the script to Bob Weinstein's assistant, Richard Potter. Believing it had potential, <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to Weinstein's attention. Studios began {{to drop out of the}} bidding as the price of the script increased, and the final two bidders were Oliver Stone, who was at the time working under Cinergi Pictures, and the Weinsteins of Dimension Films. Williamson agreed to a bid of $400,000 from Miramax, plus a contract for two sequels and a possible fourth unrelated film. Williamson said he chose Dimension because he believed they would produce Scary Movie immediately and without significantly censoring the violence in the script. Craven read the script before he became involved in the production, and considered convincing a studio to buy it for him to direct. However, by the time Craven read the script, it had already been sold.|$|E

6000|$|When I {{had been}} sitting there for five or ten minutes I saw Mahony's grey suit approaching. He came up the hill, smiling, and clambered up beside me on the bridge. While we were waiting <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> out the {{catapult}} which bulged from his inner pocket and explained some improvements which he had made in it. I asked him why <b>he</b> had <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> and <b>he</b> told me <b>he</b> had <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to have some gas with the birds. Mahony used slang freely, and spoke of Father Butler as Old Bunser. We waited on {{for a quarter of}} an hour more but still there was no sign of Leo Dillon. Mahony, at last, jumped down and said: ...|$|R

25|$|Bookkeeping by double entry {{may have}} been known to Stevin, as he was a clerk in Antwerp in his younger years, either {{practically}} or through the medium of the works of Italian authors such as Luca Pacioli and Gerolamo Cardano. However, Stevin was the first to recommend the use of impersonal accounts in the national household. <b>He</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> into practice for Prince Maurice, and recommended it to the French statesman Sully.|$|E
25|$|Hubert has had {{the most}} success in the Craftsman Truck Series, scoring two top fives in fifteen races. He would make his first start in 1997 with Dana Racing at Colorado where he would finish 23rd. Hubert would race an {{additional}} four races in the #18 Dana Dodge. He dominated the 1997 Kragen / Exide 151 at Infineon Raceway only to finish second to Joe Ruttman. In 1998 he would drive five races for Phelon Motorsports in the #66 Carlin Burners & Controls Ford. His best finish was a 5th at Gateway {{and he was able}} to get a pole at Sears Point. Hubert would also drive one race for Engineered Victories Inc and finish 24th in the #89 Cyberdyne Tech Chevrolet. In 1999, he would compete in three races for Conley Racing and one race for Marty Walsh's #81 team. He had a wild ride during the 100th race in Craftsman Truck series history at Evergreen when he spun after contact from behind by David Starr through an opening in the inside wall and went into the infield. Amazingly, he didn't hit anything, but when <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> into the pits seconds later, his brakes failed and his truck caught fire, sending him out. His best finish during the season, 17th, would come in the #7 Conely Racing Engines Chevrolet at Phoenix. He has yet to return to the Craftsman Truck Series since the 1999 season.|$|E

500|$|Keef {{has drawn}} {{comparisons}} to 50 Cent, as The New York Times writes, that like 50 Cent, Keef [...] makes thuggery, [...] "a {{major part of}} his early-career persona." [...] Lupe Fiasco, who {{has been involved with}} a controversy with Keef, has been referred to as an [...] "antagonist" [...] to Keef's more gangsta-rap persona. The New York Times writes, [...] "Lupe Fiasco is a stern and didactic teacher, but it’s arguable that Chief Keef’s music is far better at ringing warning bells." [...] Another rapper, Common, has praised Chief Keef's contributions to rap, stating, [...] "I think Chief Keef brought something that nobody else was doing and <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> raw. <b>He</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> real. With that, I have to respect that as an artist that he has come and brought that." [...] Other rappers, such as Rhymefest and Lupe Fiasco, however, have been critical of Chief (see controversies section below).|$|E
500|$|The Codex Boreelianus {{is named}} after Johann Boreel (1577–1629), Dutch Ambassador at the Court of James I of England. There is no record of Boreel's obtaining the codex, but it is {{generally}} believed that <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to the Netherlands {{from one of his}} travels to the Middle East. The connection to Boreel is indicated by Wettstein, who was given a partial collation of the codex in 1730. The collation was made by Izaak Verburg, rector of the Amsterdam gymnasium, and contained text from Matthew 7:2 to Luke 11. Wettstein adds that he was not aware of its current location. Wettstein cited the codex in his Novum Testamentum Graecum (1751), also in these parts, which do not survive to the present day (e.g. Matthew 7:9).|$|E

500|$|The surreal, largely improvised story {{began with}} a series of {{unrelated}} short strips that Brown went on to tie into a single narrative. [...] Brown first serialized it in his comic book Yummy Fur, and the first, incomplete collected edition in 1989, titled Ed the Happy Clown: A Yummy Fur Book. [...] Shortly after, Brown became unsatisfied with the direction of the serial; <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to an abrupt end in the eighteenth issue of Yummy Fur and turned to autobiography. [...] A second edition titled Ed the Happy Clown: The Definitive Ed Book appeared in 1992 with an altered ending and most of the later parts of the series eliminated. [...] The contents of this edition were re-serialized with extensive endnotes in 2005–2006 as a nine-issue Ed the Happy Clown series and collected as Ed the Happy Clown: A [...] in 2012.|$|E
500|$|Stravinsky first {{conducted}} {{the work in}} 1926, in a concert given by the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam; two years later <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to the Salle Pleyel in Paris for two performances under his baton. Of these occasions he later wrote that [...] "thanks to the experience I had gained {{with all kinds of}} orchestras... I had reached a point where I could obtain exactly what I wanted, as I wanted it". Commentators have broadly agreed that the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than it has on the stage; many of Stravinsky's revisions to the music were made with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind. The work has become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras, and has been cited by Leonard Bernstein as [...] "the most important piece of music of the 20th century".|$|E
500|$|Meeker {{was given}} a truck chassis and money to modify it into a wagon-topped vehicle by Henry Ford in 1928 for yet another Trail trip. [...] Ford offered to make the vehicle more {{comfortable}} for Meeker if <b>he</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> to the Ford factory in Dearborn, Michigan. [...] Accordingly, when he left New York [...] in August 1928 on another journey, planning to sell half dollars along the way, he headed directly for Michigan. He arrived ill, and was hospitalized, almost dying there. [...] He was able to return home, disgruntled at having missed voting in the election (he supported the successful Republican candidate, Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, for president) {{for the first time}} since 1853. [...] At his home in Washington state, Meeker again became ill in November, and died December 3, 1928, three and a half weeks before his 98th birthday. [...] He was buried in a cemetery in Puyallup, a place he had helped settle. [...] Meeker's headstone bears a plaque reproducing the wagon side of the half dollar.|$|E

Polonsky's band featured Marc Ribot on guitar, Sebastian Steinberg of Soul Coughing on bass, and Sim Cain of Rollins Band on drums. Of that performance, singer Jeff Buckley (who was in attendance) was later quoted as saying, [...] "He came to CBGB's Gallery and ripped it up...He killed 'em...The charm of <b>it</b> is that <b>he's</b> <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> into his own thing.
