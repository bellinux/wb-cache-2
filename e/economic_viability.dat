5|$|Accordingly, {{building}} a new oil terminal in Europe capable of handling the largest vessels that were planned was judged appropriate. The intention was that oil coming from the Middle East would be off-loaded at this terminal and then stored for trans-shipment to European refineries using smaller vessels. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 {{as a result of}} the Six-Day War reinforced the <b>economic</b> <b>viability</b> of this scheme. Oil shipments had to come round the Cape of Good Hope, thus avoiding the vessel size constraints previously imposed by the canal.|$|E

During Jennings's second term the state government continued to support public improvements, with new road construction and expanded settlement into central Indiana. After Indianapolis became {{the site for the}} state's permanent capital in 1821 and new settlers arrived in the area, the Indiana General Assembly appropriated $100,000 for new road construction and improvements to some of the more important routes, but it was considerably short of the amount needed.|$|E
5|$|Lord Kelvin {{invented the}} heat pump in 1852, and Heinrich Zoelly had {{patented}} {{the idea of}} using it to draw heat from the ground in 1912. But {{it was not until the}} late 1940s that the geothermal heat pump was successfully implemented. The earliest one was probably Robert C. Webber's home-made 2.2kW direct-exchange system, but sources disagree as to the exact timeline of his invention. J. Donald Kroeker designed the first commercial geothermal heat pump to heat the Commonwealth Building (Portland, Oregon) and demonstrated it in 1946. Professor Carl Nielsen of Ohio State University built the first residential open loop version in his home in 1948. The technology became popular in Sweden as a result of the 1973 oil crisis, and has been growing slowly in worldwide acceptance since then. The 1979 development of polybutylene pipe greatly augmented the heat pump’s <b>economic</b> <b>viability.</b>|$|E
5|$|Questions then arose {{among the}} U.S. {{administration}} and military leadership {{as to the}} best method by which Hanoi (the perceived locus of the insurgency) could be dissuaded from its course of action. The answer seemed to lie {{in the application of}} air power. By 1964 most of the civilians surrounding President Lyndon B. Johnson shared the Joint Chiefs of Staff's collective faith in the efficacy of strategic bombing to one degree or another. They reasoned that a small nation like North Vietnam, with a tiny industrial base that was just emerging after the First Indochina War, would be reluctant to risk its new-found <b>economic</b> <b>viability</b> to support the insurgency in the south. Constantly affecting this decision-making process were fears of possible counter moves or outright intervention by the Soviet Union, the PRC, or both. The civilians and the military were divided, however, on the manner of affecting Hanoi's will to support the southern insurgency. The civilians thought in terms of changing the regime's behavior while the military men were more concerned with breaking its will.|$|E

5|$|The British South Africa Company had {{reservations}} about devoting all of Southern Rhodesia's {{resources to the}} war effort, {{in part because of}} its desire to keep the colonial economy operating. There was indeed tightening of belts in the Rhodesias during the war, but not on the same scale as in Britain. The retail sector suffered, prices for many basic day-to-day items rose sharply, and exports plummeted as much of the white male citizenry went overseas to war, but mining, the industry on which Rhodesia's <b>economic</b> <b>viability</b> hinged, continued to operate successfully, despite occasional difficulties in obtaining manpower. The Company administration posted record outputs of gold and coal during 1916, and began to supply the Empire with the strategic metal ferrochrome.

40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} {{different}} solar technologies and its suitability for hybridization with biomass for {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) generation in Europe. Although hybrid solar-biomass research and demonstration {{is in its}} infancy, {{it has the potential to}} provide dispatchable renewable energy at a significant scale over many areas in Europe. Therefore, this review examines the technical and economic reported performances on hybrid systems in order to assess the technical and <b>economic</b> <b>viabilities</b> of newly-emerging projects. Three different combinations of solar and biomass technologies are discussed in this paper: solar tower (ST) - biomass, parabolic trough (PT) - biomass and linear Fresnel (LF) - biomass systems. Using findings from literature, case studies and industry sources, this review compares each of these systems with respect to their technical and economical parameters. The paper shows that, of the three concentrated solar power (CSP) technologies, ST provides the best overall efficiencies for both heat and power generation. However, complex installation requirements and high capital cost may explain poor uptake of this technology. Of the three systems, LF suffers from relatively high optical and thermal losses and also to greater cosine effect losses; which may explain why this technology is also poorly deployed. Only one solar-biomass hybrid power plant is currently operating in Spain; this uses PT technology due to its comparatively easy installation process compared to ST and relatively higher heat and optical gain than LF...|$|R
