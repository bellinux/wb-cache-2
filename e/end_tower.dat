60|$|I {{should think}} {{the length of}} the house {{on the side of the}} square which {{contains}} the staircase might be ninety feet, including the tower at the end, and the tower at the angle; and perhaps the side which contains the offices may be even a little longer; though this will also include the same tower in the same angle, as well as the one at the opposite corner; while the side in which is the gateway can scarcely exceed sixty feet. If my estimates, which are merely made by the eye, are correct, including the towers, this would give an outside wall of two hundred and fifty feet, in circuit. Like most French buildings, the depth is comparatively much less. I question if the outer drawing-room is more than eighteen feet wide, though it is near thirty long. This room has windows on the court and on the lawn, and is the first apartment one enters after ascending the stairs. It communicates with the inner drawing-room, which is in the <b>end</b> <b>tower</b> of this side of the chateau, is quite round, of course, and may be twenty feet in diameter.|$|E

40|$|Given {{the fact}} that the {{installing}} costs of an optical ground wire on overhead lines directly depend on its cross-section, which in turn depends on the level of fault current it should withstand, in order to reduce these current values in the optical ground wire, I suggested performing its isolated descents from the <b>end</b> <b>towers</b> of the line with its transition to an optical cable. The research was carried out on the example of a 500 kV overhead line in the National Electric Power Grid. The Method of Symmetrical Components for calculating asymmetrical fault currents was not used; therefore, calculations were carried out on the base of presenting the line as a multi-wire system for the considered case as a five-wire system (optical ground wire, steel ground wire, and three phase wires). Such approach allows taking into account the initial asymmetry of the line parameters and modeling any kind of asymmetrical faults. The analyses of calculated results were performed. The conclusive evidence that the optical ground wire isolated descents from the <b>end</b> <b>towers</b> of the line give the possibility of reducing the level of maximal fault current distribution values in it and therefore its cross section, is presented...|$|R

Near the amphitheatre, where the sing takes place, the folly Nab <b>End</b> <b>Tower</b> can be found. The tower was built in 1861 by {{unemployed}} local woollen mill workers. In 2008 it was restored by Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council at a cost of £200,000.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} a {{composite}} building of flint and ragstone rubble with ragstone and Caen Stone dessings. Generally the earlier work is flint/ragstone and the later rubble/limestone. The plan is traditional with a rectangular chancel, arch, nave with aisles north and south and west <b>end</b> <b>tower.</b> The chancel, nave and lower parts of the tower are Norman. In the 14th century the tower stair and south aisle were added. The north aisle was added (or possibly rebuilt) in 1884.|$|E
50|$|A. W. Buck House is a {{historic}} home located at Ebensburg, Cambria County, Pennsylvania. It was built in 1889, and is a high style Queen Anne style dwelling. A two-story wing with <b>end</b> <b>tower</b> was built in 1903. It is a 2 1/2-story, three-bay brick building. It features an eight sided, three-story tower and a wrap-around porch. It was originally built as a private residence. In 1923, it was purchased by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown as a convent for the Sisters of St. Joseph.|$|E
50|$|In Kingston, Ontario, {{the annual}} FebFest snow {{sculpture}} competition in Confederation Park features snow forts by the Royal Military College of Canada and Queen's University. The snow forts {{must not only}} be pleasing to look at but also safe for children to play on. In 2008, Royal Military College's snow fort was modelled after the MacKenzie Building in the Second Empire style with a Mansard roof, and a central tower incorporating a working clock, flanked by projecting <b>end</b> <b>towers</b> and a slide. Both teams worked through the night, filling rectangular recycling bins with snow.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{bridge was}} to be a [...] "Bollman suspension truss". The Little Pipe Creek bridge and viaduct structures were to be a mixture of wrought iron tension members and cast iron compression members,including other decorative elements, such as Doric styled vertical members and <b>end</b> <b>towers,</b> all cast iron and detailed. Bollman built about a hundred of these bridges through 1873 and this bridge with a creek span of 135 feet, 60 feet above water {{was one of the last}} and largest bridges built by Bollman using his patent.|$|R
5000|$|The truss {{includes}} decorative elements, such as Doric styled vertical members. The {{cast iron}} <b>end</b> <b>towers,</b> which bear transfer {{the weight of}} the structure to the abutments and pier, are also detailed. A decorative and protective metal enclosure {{at the top of the}} towers was lost to vandalism, but was replaced during the restoration work. Metal strips at each portal read [...] "W. BOLLMAN, PATENTEE", [...] "BALTIMORE, MD.", [...] "BUILT BY B&O R.R. CO.", [...] "1869" [...] AND [...] "RENEWED 1866". Replicas of the original strips were installed during the restoration.|$|R

50|$|The Old Bell is a {{hotel and}} {{restaurant}} {{on the edge of}} the Cotswolds in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, England. Built on the remains of outbuildings of Malmesbury Abbey, it lays claim to being the oldest existing hotel in England, standing on foundations dated to 1220, and is a Grade I listed building. It is located in Abbey Row adjacent to the abbey, which was built to accommodate scholars studying at the abbey. The bell of the inn sign refers to St Aldhelm's bell, the great bell in a peal of ten that once hung in the former west <b>end</b> <b>tower</b> of the abbey church, noted by John Leland's Itinerary and in William Camden's Britannia.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} that the nave was {{extended}} a West <b>end</b> <b>tower</b> was built. The original tower only extended as far as the first string course, roughly on a level with the top of the nave roof. The base of the tower communicates directly with the nave through a simple pointed arch. Above the arch can be seen a blocked doorway, this gave access to an upper room. Lancet windows illuminated this room, but those to the north and south have been blocked. In the 15th century the upper stage was added which now houses the bells. The eastern face has just a small opening, the other three have two light windows now closed by the louvres for the bells. The parapet is castellated.|$|E

5000|$|Construction of {{the third}} cathedral, now Gothic in style, began circa 1205, but {{problems}} with the foundation delayed continued work until 1255 under Bishop Martín Fernández {{with the support of}} King Alfonso X of Castile and León. The design is attributed to the master Enrique, perhaps a native of France, who had previously worked on the Cathedral of Burgos. Clearly, he knew the Gothic architectural form of the Isle of France. He died in 1277 and was replaced by the Spaniard Juan Perez. In 1289, Bishop Martín Fernández was also dying when the front of the temple was already open for worship. The basic structure of the cathedral was finished soon, and in 1302 Bishop Gonzalo Osorio opened the whole church to the faithful. However, during the fourteenth century the cloister, the north <b>end</b> <b>tower</b> were at last to be finished, and the south tower was not completed until {{the second half of the}} fifteenth century.|$|E

The intent of the guidelines is to consider building faces, setbacks, and step-backs for individual sites in relation to the surrounding development sites, and to the scale, proportion and quality of the public open spaces. Expression Lines are to be developed architecturally as a linear element or projection, marked by a change in colour, texture or material. Expression Lines mark the base of buildings, and help reduce its scale. Towers should be slender in width to maintain the broadest possible views between buildings.
