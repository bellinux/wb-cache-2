40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{provides}} {{an estimate of}} the prevalence of risk <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> venous thromboembolism among hospital patients. METHODS: The presence of risk <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> venous thromboembolism was determined from a retrospective review of the medical records of 1, 000 randomly selected patients in 16 acute care hospitals in central Massachusetts. RESULTS: The most common risk <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> venous thromboembolism were age 40 years (59 %) or more, obesity (28 %), and major surgery (23 %). The average number of risk factors increased with increasing age. One or more risk <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> venous thromboembolism were present in 78 % of hospital patients, two or more in 48 %, three or more in 19 %, four or more in 6 %, and five or more in 1 %. CONCLUSION: Risk <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> venous thromboembolism are common among hospital patients, suggesting that prophylaxis should be widely employed. The cost-effectiveness and risk benefit of prophylaxis is well established in patients undergoing major surgery. Further studies are needed to confirm the benefit of prophylaxis in patients with nonsurgical risk <b>factors</b> <b>for</b> venous thromboembolism...|$|R

5|$|Estimates of the {{heritability}} {{of schizophrenia}} is around 80%, which implies that 80% {{of the individual}} differences in risk to schizophrenia is explained by individual differences in genetics. These estimates vary {{because of the difficulty}} in separating genetic and environmental influences. The greatest single risk <b>factor</b> <b>for</b> developing schizophrenia is having a first-degree relative with the disease (risk is 6.5%); more than 40% of monozygotic twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected.
