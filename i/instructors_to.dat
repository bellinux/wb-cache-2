5|$|In more {{advanced}} developing countries, establishing ambulance transport systems is more feasible, but still requires considerable expertise and planning. Prior to 2004, Pakistan {{did not have}} an organized emergency medical system. In that year, Rescue 1122 was launched as a professional pre-hospital emergency service, and it has managed to achieve an average response time of 7 minutes, comparable to that of developed nations. Some of the critical factors in its success included local manufacture of vehicles, training <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> certify emergency medical technicians, adopting training materials to the local context, and branching out to include fire and rescue service response under a united command structure.|$|E
5|$|At Velfarre, she was {{introduced}} to her future producer, Max Matsuura, through a friend. After hearing Hamasaki sing karaoke, Matsuura offered her a recording deal, but Hamasaki suspected ulterior motives and turned the offer down. He persisted and succeeded in recruiting her for the Avex label in the following year. Hamasaki started vocal training, but skipped most of her classes after finding her <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> be too rigid and the classes dull. When she confessed this to Matsuura, he sent her to New York to train her vocals under another method. During her foreign sojourn, Hamasaki frequently corresponded with Matsuura and impressed him with her style of writing. On her return to Japan, he suggested that she try writing her own lyrics.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} the ship arrived in Leningrad, only the two forward gun turrets had been {{installed}} and the bridge superstructure was incomplete. The only secondary guns installed were the 3.7cm anti-aircraft guns. The Soviet Navy renamed the ship Petropavlovsk on 25 September 1940, and designated the construction effort to complete the ship Projekt 83. The vessel's design {{provided the basis for}} a planned heavy cruiser, designated Projekt 82, although this ship was canceled before work began. Training for the Soviet crew of the ship proved to be contentious; the Soviets wanted their personnel trained in Germany, while the Germans preferred sending <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> the Soviet Union. Language barriers and inexperience with international training missions also hampered the training effort.|$|E
5|$|In May 1962, Serong was {{selected}} to lead the 30-man Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) of <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> South Vietnam. Serong had been appointed by Pollard—with whom he was close friends—and was given authority to act unilaterally. He conducted a reconnaissance of South Vietnam in June, and {{the main body of}} the AATTV began arriving in early August. Serong based his headquarters in Saigon; the rest of the team was located at various installations throughout the country. Although the AATTV was mostly involved in training the South Vietnamese forces, a few had been attached to the Combined Studies Division, run by the CIA as a counter-insurgency organisation. Serong later became a counter-insurgency advisor to General Paul Harkins, Commander US MACV, but this relationship ended under Pollard's successor, Lieutenant General John Wilton, who reduced Serong's autonomy while continuing to grant him considerable latitude. In May 1963 Serong accepted an invitation to visit the US Special Warfare School in North Carolina, only informing the Military Board after doing so, and he later visited West Germany to become familiar with intelligence activities there, again without informing Wilton, who reacted angrily after finding out about it from a newspaper report. Meanwhile, in late 1963, Serong started to redeploy members of the team into combat advisory roles, and by February 1964 some officers and NCOs were working with Special Forces teams involved in counter-insurgency operations. Resulting in the first involvement of Australian personnel in combat during the conflict, this was a significant decision; it was retrospectively approved by Wilton, who lifted earlier restrictions on the role of AATTV personnel that had prevented them being involved in combat.|$|E

25|$|After the March 11th 2011 earthquake, when {{embassies}} were urging {{their citizens}} to evacuate, Nova pressured <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> move to Tokyo or have allowances cut. The GU members at one Nova branch protested and negotiated with Nova and the allowances were repaid.|$|E
25|$|By 20 October {{there had}} been both union {{organized}} and wildcat strikes over the unpaid wages. The numerous delays of wages also led individual teachers also to boycott classes. On 23 October, the Osaka Labor Standards office accepted a demand by Nova <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> investigate criminal charges against Sahashi over delayed and unpaid wages.|$|E

It supplied 100 <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> replace the departing French mentors. It also supplied six C-47s, two DHC L-20s, and two L-19 Bird Dogs. They also began airfield construction throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|Hatamoto patronized the {{development}} of the martial arts in the Edo period; many of them were involved in the running of dojo in the Edo area and elsewhere. Two hatamoto who were directly involved in {{the development}} of the martial arts were Yagyū Munenori and Yamaoka Tesshū. Munenori's family became hereditary sword <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> the shogun.|$|E
25|$|The later 1960s and 1970s {{witnessed}} {{an increased}} media interest in Chinese martial arts, influenced by martial artist Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee is credited {{as one of}} the first <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> openly teach Chinese martial arts to Westerners. World Judo Championships have been held since 1956, Judo at the Summer Olympics was introduced in 1964. Karate World Championships were introduced in 1970.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, {{after two}} Nova {{instructors}} were arrested on drug charges in August and September, Nova asked all 3,100 <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> {{sign an agreement}} to have a mandatory drug test, the results {{of which would be}} reported to the police. The drug test only applied to foreign staff. This action led to the General Union branch of Nova being founded on 6 September 1994. At the same time there was also a NUGW Nova branch founded in Kanto.|$|E
25|$|In June 1985, Dornier {{announced}} that it was studying its own third generation Alpha Jet upgrade program, independent of Dassault. This proposed upgrade involved substantial avionics upgrades and man-machine interface alterations, such as the addition of multiple head-up displays (HUDs) to allow <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> view what students are viewing, with the aim of being more suited for the sophisticated requirements of modern and impending fighter aircraft; Dornier had judged the Alpha Jet's airframe itself to have been suitable without modification for future market needs.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a {{shortage}} of academically qualified <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> teach at schools of nursing worldwide. The serious need for educational capacity is not being met, which is the underlying most important preparation resource for the nurses of tomorrow. The decrease in faculty everywhere is due to many factors including decrease in satisfaction with the workforce, poor salaries, and reduction in full-time equivalent. Throughout the span of 6 years the nursing faculty shortage has been written about an increasing amount. Unfortunately, there is no clear consensus or an organized plan on how to fix the ongoing issue.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after graduating}} high school, Fairgrave {{spent a few}} months at the Guy Durrell Dramatic School and worked briefly as a secretary. Bored with the prospects, she began hanging around airfields near her home and {{attempted}} to convince the airport manager to allow one of his flight <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> take her flying. The manager finally agreed, thinking that he could scare Fairgrave's interest in aviation out of her by performing various aerobatic maneuvers {{in an attempt to}} make her sick. Instead, Fairgrave demanded more flight time and used some of her inheritance to purchase a Curtiss JN-4 biplane after her fourth flight.|$|E
25|$|Makart {{was the son}} of a chamberlain at the Mirabell Palace, born in {{the former}} {{residence}} of the prince-archbishops of Salzburg. Initially, he received his training in painting at the Vienna Academy between 1850 and 1851 from Johann Fischbach. While in the Academy, German art was under the rule of a classicism, which was entirely intellectual and academic—clear and precise drawing, sculpturesque modelling, and pictorial erudition were esteemed above all. Makart, who was a poor draughtsman, but who had a passionate and sensual love of color, was impatient to escape the routine of art school drawing. For his fortune, he was found by his <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> be devoid of all talent and forced to leave the Vienna Academy.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, {{after two}} {{instructors}} were arrested on drug charges in August and September, Nova asked all 3,100 <b>instructors</b> <b>to</b> {{sign an agreement}} to have a mandatory drug test, the results {{of which would be}} reported to the police. The drug test only applied to foreign staff. The Osaka Bar Association wrote an opinion that the policy was a violation of the teachers' right to privacy. Nova claimed consent forms had been received from more than 90 percent of employees. According to the union, no instructors were ever required to take a drug test. On 31 January 2007, seven Nova teachers were charged with possession of illegal drugs arising from the arrest of two men in Roppongi on 19 November 2006.|$|E
