25|$|After Phil {{is treated}} at a clinic, Alan confesses {{that he had}} drugged some of the marshmallows from the {{previous}} night with muscle relaxers and ADHD medication in order to sedate Teddy but accidentally mixed up the bags. Phil and Stu become furious that Alan drugged them again. Stu blames Alan for ruining his life and attacks him. Phil breaks it up and tells them that they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> together. They notice something on Alan's stomach: an address and a time for a meeting. They meet a gangster named Kingsley, who demands Chow's bank account password {{by the next morning}} in exchange for Teddy. They return to the hotel to try to find Chow's password, only to discover that he is still alive. They steal the monkey (who had the code given to him and put inside his jacket for safe-keeping by Chow) back from the Russian mobsters through a violent car chase, during which the monkey is shot and injured. After taking the code and leaving the monkey at a veterinary clinic, the group completes the deal with Kingsley. Suddenly, Interpol agents appear and arrest Chow. Kingsley turns out to be an undercover agent, who tells the trio that the police had used the information that Teddy had disappeared to arrest Chow and Kingsley actually does not know where Teddy is.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack for On Her Majesty's Secret Service {{has been}} called [...] "perhaps the best score of the series." [...] It was composed, {{arranged}} and conducted by John Barry; it was his fifth successive Bond film. Barry opted to use more electrical instruments and a more aggressive sound in the music – [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> my oar in the musical area double strong to make the audience try and forget they don't have Sean... to be Bondian beyond Bondian." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore {{described}} the recording process as challenging {{because she was}} provided with little visual aid, explaining, [...] "All I had to work off were a few sketches ... {{but it was also}} fun because it allows you to go into the depths of your imagination." [...] She also revealed that creating Rapunzel's voice was simply a process of [...] "let go". Moore was often required to re-record a single line a total of four times before the directors finally heard a version with which they were satisfied. After watching the completed film for the first time, Moore was disappointed with her own performance because she felt that her voice sounded [...] "shrill". According to composer Alan Menken, Moore's musical background made her [...] "a delight to work with". Moore found the practice of performing in character challenging in comparison to recording her own original music, explaining, [...] "I can't just be like Mandy and sing something the way that I want to necessarily, because you know, you sort of <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> to certain guidelines." [...] She found recording [...] "When Will My Life Begin" [...] particularly difficult due to the speed at which she had to say certain words, and cites both Menken and discovering Rapunzel herself as a character with guiding her through the process.|$|E

500|$|Owing to {{a decline}} in {{population}} and lack of interest in the mail contract, the GPO ended its presence on Lundy at the end of 1927. For the next two years Harman handled the mail to and from the island without charge. On 1 November 1929, he decided to offset the expense by issuing two postage stamps (½ puffin in pink and 1 puffin in blue). One puffin is equivalent to one English penny. The printing of Puffin stamps continues to this day and they are available at face value from the Lundy Post Office. One used to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> Lundy stamps {{on the back of the}} envelope; but Royal Mail now allows their use on the front of the envelope, but placed on the left side, with the right side reserved for the Royal Mail postage stamp or stamps. Lundy stamps are cancelled by a circular Lundy handstamp. The face value of the Lundy Island stamps covers the cost of postage of letters and postcards from the island to the Bideford Post Office on the mainland for onward delivery to their final destination anywhere in the world. The Lundy Post Office gets a bulk rate discount for mailing letters and postcards from Bideford. Lundy stamps are a type of postage stamp known to philatelists as [...] "local carriage labels" [...] or [...] "local stamps". Issues of increasing value were made over the years, including air mail, featuring a variety of people. Many are now highly sought-after by collectors. The market value of the early issues has risen substantially over the years. For the many thousands of annual visitors Lundy stamps have become part of the collection of the many British Local Posts collectors. The first catalogues of these stamps included Gerald Rosen's 1970 Catalogue of British Local Stamps. Later specialist catalogues include Stamps of Lundy Island by Stanley Newman, first published in 1984, Phillips Modern British Locals CD Catalogue, published since 2003, and Labbe's Specialised Guide to Lundy Island Stamps, published since 2005 and now in its 11th Edition. Labbe's Guide is considered the gold standard of Lundy catalogues owing to its extensive approach to varieties, errors, specialised items and [...] "fantasy" [...] issues. There is a comprehensive collection of these stamps in the Chinchen Collection, donated by Barry Chinchen to the British Library Philatelic Collections in 1977 and now held by the British Library. This is also the home of the Landmark Trust Lundy Island Philatelic Archive which includes artwork, texts and essays as well as postmarking devices and issued stamps.|$|E
2500|$|Localized lovebug flights can {{number in}} the {{hundreds}} of thousands. The slow, drifting movement of the insects is almost reminiscent of snow fall except that the flies also rise in the air. Two major flights occur each year, first in late spring, then again in late summer. In south Florida, a third (but smaller) flight can occur in December. [...] The spring flight occurs during late April and May, and in the summer during late August and September. Flights extend over periods of four to five weeks. Mating takes place almost immediately after emergence of the females. Adult females live only three to four days, while males live a little longer. They <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> to each other at all times.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the name}} of the {{magazine}} suggested a male-oriented magazine, Gentleman was anything but. They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> the name due to corporate red-tape, and as a relief, used the tagline [...] "Gentleman: Mindspace for Men".|$|R

6000|$|... "That {{seems to}} me conceited," [...] {{observed}} Miss Doyle, composedly. [...] "Detective stories don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> to facts; or, rather, {{they can make the}} facts to be whatever they please.

50|$|Rodney Savage {{recognises}} that he {{is losing}} out to his social inferior, but realises {{that he is}} powerless to prevent it.

60|$|A hotel, awful high, {{higher than}} Oscar Tollefson's new red barn; three stories, one {{right on top}} of another; you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> your head back to look clear up to the top. There was a swell {{traveling}} man in there--probably been to Chicago, lots of times.|$|R

It {{is the first}} artist-run nonprofit organization in Bangladesh, which focuses on experimental and dynamic art. Her works were largely influenced by September 11 attacks in New York in 2001.
