500|$|Semen {{collection}} is naturally an integral component of this entire process. [...] Once semen has been collected {{it can be}} used immediately for insemination or slowly frozen for use at a later date. Fresh semen is recognized as the method of choice as it lives longer and yields higher conception rates. <b>Frozen</b> <b>semen</b> will work but it must be the highest quality of semen and the ewes must be inseminated twice in the same day. The marketing of ram semen is a major part of this industry. [...] Producers owning prize winning rams have found this to be a good avenue to leverage the accolades of their most famous animals.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Debbie Hamilton, an American, {{founded the}} Hamilton Rare Breeds Foundation on a [...] farm in Hartland, Vermont, to breed Poitou donkeys. As of 2004, she owned 26 {{purebred}} and 14 partbred Poitous, making hers the largest Poitou breeding {{operation in the}} United States, and the second largest in the world, behind the French government-sponsored experimental farm. Hamilton works with French officials toward {{the preservation of the}} breed, and has received praise from French veterinarians, who appreciate her technical and financial contributions to the breed.

500|$|In the 1970s, {{the breed}} {{began to be}} revived through {{increased}} public interest. Breed societies have been established in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, France, and Germany, and in 1996 the first World Shire Horse Congress was held in Peterborough. The first use within the breed of artificial insemination through <b>frozen</b> <b>semen</b> was with several Australian mares in 1997. Between the 1920s and 1930s and today, the Shire has changed in conformation. The Clydesdale was used for cross-breeding in the 1950s and 1960s, which changed the conformation of the Shire and most notably changed the feathering on the lower legs from a mass of coarse hair into the silky feathering associated with modern Shires. At the peak of their population, Shires numbered [...] over a million. In the 1950s and 1960s, this number declined to a few thousand. In the United States, the Shire population dropped significantly {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, and continued to decline in the 1940s and 1950s. Between 1950 and 1959, only 25 horses were registered in the United States. However, numbers began to increase, and 121 horses were registered in the US by 1985.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The {{aim was to}} {{determine}} the motion and kinematics characteristic of frozen-thawed spermatozoa in Sirohi goat using computer-assisted semen analysis. Materials and Methods: A study was carried out in Sirohi buck. Semen collection was made biweekly from each buck with the help of artificial vagina. A total of 12 ejaculates were collected from two bucks (six ejaculates from each buck). Freshly collected semen was pooled and later evaluated. The pooled semen sample was extended with standard glycerolated egg yolk tris extender and later subjected to a process of cryopreservation. The motion and kinematic characteristics of spermatozoa were studied during freez-thawing process. Results: Significantly (p< 0. 01) higher value of live percent, hypo-osmotic swelling test, and acrosomal integrity were recorded in neat semen followed by diluted and <b>frozen</b> thaw <b>semen.</b> The proportion of spermatozoa showing slow progression were the highest in the neat and diluted semen followed by rapid and non-progressively motile, while a reverse pattern was observed in the <b>frozen</b> thaw <b>semen</b> where the proportion of non-progressively motile spermatozoa were significantly (p< 0. 01) higher followed by slow and rapid progression. Conclusion: This study showed that the best results for motion, vitality, plasma membrane integrity, and acrosome status were obtained in the neat semen followed by diluted and <b>frozen</b> thaw <b>semen.</b> Further, the process of cryopreservation results in a shift of motility from slow to non-progressive in the post-thaw semen with a significant decrease in the path velocities when compared to neat and diluted semen. Hence, it can be concluded that freezing-thawing process reduces the motility and kinematic characters spermatozoa and may be an important factor affecting the fertilizing ability of spermatozoa resulting in poor conception rate after insemination in goats...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{efficacy}} of pericervical insemination with unprepared semen with that of intrauterine insemination with prepared donor semen in a prospective, randomized, crossover clinical trial.

Eleven pregnancies ensued from 54 cycles of intrauterine insemination (20. 4 % per cycle), and 2 pregnancies ensued from 58 cycles of pericervical insemination (3. 4 % per cycle, p =. 005). Five pregnancies ensued during the first treatment cycle (13. 2 %), 4 during the second treatment cycle (17. 4 %), 2 during the third (13. 2 %), 1 during the fourth (7. 1 %), and 1 after the fourth treatment cycle (4. 8 %). The significantly better pregnancy rate from intrauterine insemination with prepared semen supports this treatment option.
