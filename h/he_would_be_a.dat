5|$|Despite being {{currently}} {{portrayed as}} an underachiever, Bart was actually very happy and looking forward {{about going to}} school. However, the boy's initial enthusiastic nature is crushed by an uncaring and bitter teacher who said that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> failure at life and never amount to anything.

Jim jokingly says that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> beet growing competitor during the national contests while Harry would retire after selling one big item such as an airplane. Before he leaves, Harry says that Robert will be the ruin of the company and says they will not be working for Dunder Mifflin in six months, leaving a look of concern on Dwight and Jim's faces.|$|E
5|$|Bill Wood, the Astros' general manager, {{said the}} team {{believed}} Nevin {{was close to}} a major-league level and would require little development in minor league baseball. As evidence for this, the Astros pointed to Nevin's training with the wooden bats used in professional baseball {{in an effort to}} prepare himself for the transition from metal bats. The Astros believed <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> solid power hitter and have a strong work ethic. Nevin also did not intend to seek a signing bonus approaching those received by Van Poppel and Taylor. The Astros decided to employ Nevin as a third baseman. Not wanting to draw out his contract negotiations, Nevin signed with Houston in June, receiving a $700,000 bonus.|$|E

5|$|In April 1946, the Prime Minister, Ben Chifley, asked Oliphant if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{technical}} {{advisor to the}} Australian delegation to the newly formed United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC), which was debating international control of nuclear weapons. Oliphant agreed, and joined the Minister for External Affairs, H. V. Evatt and the Australian Representative at the United Nations, Paul Hasluck, to hear the Baruch Plan. The attempt at international control was unsuccessful, and no agreement was reached.|$|E
5|$|Republicans {{nominated}} Judge Edward C. O'Rear {{to oppose}} McCreary. There were few {{differences between the}} two men's stands on the issues. Both supported progressive reforms such as the direct election of senators, a non-partisan judiciary, {{and the creation of a}} public utilities commission. McCreary also changed his stance on the liquor question, now agreeing with Beckham's prohibitionist position; this also matched the Republican position. O'Rear claimed that Democrats should have already enacted the reforms their party platform advocated, but his only ready line of attack against McCreary himself was that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> pawn of Beckham and his allies.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, John Bell Hatcher {{is backing}} out of paying his share of a card game by drawing his revolver. He has taken to gambling, as Marsh, who employs him as a bone hunter, is not {{providing}} him with enough funds. Marsh lobbies the Bureau of Indian Affairs on behalf of Red Cloud, but also visits with the Geological Survey, insinuating that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better leader of the USGS than Cope. After learning about Sam Smith's attempted sabotage of Cope and once again receiving no payment from Marsh, Hatcher leaves his employ. Marsh, now representing the survey, heads west with wealthy businessmen, scoffing at the financial misfortunes of Cope, whose investments have failed.|$|E

5|$|The first {{sport to}} {{interest}} Bolt was cricket, {{and he said}} {{if he was not}} a sprinter, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fast bowler instead. As a child, he was a supporter of the Pakistani cricket team and admired the bowling of Waqar Younis. He is also a fan of Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar, West Indian opener Chris Gayle, and Australian opener Matthew Hayden. During a charity cricket match, Bolt clean-bowled Gayle who was complimentary of Bolt's pace and swing. Bolt also struck a six off Gayle's bowling. Another bowler complimentary of Bolt's pace was former West Indies fast-bowling great Curtly Ambrose.|$|E

During this term, his brother-in-law, Joseph Apukai Akina, would serve as Speaker of the House of Representatives while his son-in-law David Kalei Kahaulelio served as sergeant-at-arm of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Access to Scottish {{universities}} {{was probably}} more open than in contemporary England, Germany or France. Attendance was {{less expensive and}} the student body more representative of society as a whole. In the eighteenth century Scotland reaped the intellectual benefits of this system in its contribution the European Enlightenment. Key figures in the Scottish Enlightenment who had made their mark before the mid-eighteenth century included Francis Hutcheson (1694–1746), who was professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow from 1729 to 1746. He was an important link between the ideas of Shaftesbury and the later school of Scottish Common Sense Realism, developing Utilitarianism and Consequentialist thinking. Colin Maclaurin (1698–1746), appointed to a chair of mathematics {{by the age of}} 19 at Marischal College, was the leading British mathematician of his era. Perhaps the most significant intellectual figure of early modern Scotland was David Hume (1711–76) whose Treatise on Human Nature (1738) and Essays, Moral and Political (1741) helped outline the parameters of philosophical Empiricism and Scepticism. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> major influence of later Enlightenment figures including Adam Smith, Immanuel Kant and Jeremy Bentham.|$|E

5|$|According {{to local}} legend Marko's mother was Evrosiya (Евросия), {{sister of the}} Bulgarian voivoda Momchil (who ruled {{territory}} in the Rhodope Mountains). At Marko's birth three narecnitsi (fairy sorceresses) appeared, predicting that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> hero and replace his father (King Vukašin). When the king heard this, he threw his son into the river in a basket {{to get rid of}} him. A samodiva named Vila found Marko and brought him up, becoming his foster mother. Because Marko drank the samodivas milk, he acquired supernatural powers and became a Bulgarian freedom fighter against the Turks. He has a winged horse named Sharkolia ("dappled") and a stepsister, the samodiva Gyura. Bulgarian legends incorporate fragments of pagan mythology and beliefs, although the Marko epic was created as late as the 14–18th centuries. Among Bulgarian epic songs, songs about Krali Marko are common and pivotal.|$|E
5|$|After the {{religious}} and political upheavals of the seventeenth century, the universities recovered with a lecture-based curriculum that embraced economics and science, offering a high quality liberal education to {{the sons of the}} nobility and gentry. It helped them to become major centres of medical education and to put Scotland at the forefront of Enlightenment thinking. Key figures in the Scottish Enlightenment who had made their mark before the mid-eighteenth century included Francis Hutcheson (1694–1746), who was professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow.

5|$|Although in 2008 Baseball America {{projected}} Venable as an {{every day}} starter for the Padres in 2010, some experts questioned whether <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> long-term solution {{in center field}} for the team. Venable started the 2009 season with the Padres' Triple-A affiliate, Portland Beavers, but he was recalled by the Padres on June 3. His father, Max, served as the Beavers' hitting coach in 2009. Following the July 5 trade of Scott Hairston to the Oakland Athletics, Venable shared right field with Kyle Blanks. On July 12 against the San Francisco Giants, he had his first home run {{of the season in}} his first career four-hit game. Between July 30 and August 5, he homered in five of seven games. In an August 23 game against the St. Louis Cardinals, he was involved in a bench-clearing incident when Albert Pujols thought he threw an elbow while being tagged out. In 2009, he posted 12 home runs and tallied 38 runs batted in (RBI), while defensively 493.2 of his 643 innings were spent in right field and only 117 in center field.|$|E

5|$|Following high school, Ross {{embarked}} on his professional career, getting {{selected by the}} Detroit Tigers in the fourth round of the 1999 Major League Baseball draft. He reached the Major Leagues in 2003, but suffered a torn ACL which caused him to miss most of September. He {{was traded to the}} Los Angeles Dodgers following spring training in 2004, appearing in a handful of games with them in 2005. In 2006, he played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Cincinnati Reds, and the Florida Marlins. It was in Florida that he finally established himself, as he played with the Marlins through 2010. He was used mainly as a reserve outfielder in 2006 and 2007, but during the 2008 season he took over a starting role. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> starting outfielder {{for the rest of his}} Marlins career, playing centerfield or right field. In 2009, he hit a career-high 24 home runs and won the Marlins' Charlie Hough Good Guy award.|$|E
5|$|From 1977 to 1983, Ford was {{a member}} of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. He first sought the post of Democratic whip in 1988, but lost to California's Alan Cranston, who had held the post since 1977. Ford got a late start in the race, and a New York Times writer opined that he {{overestimated}} his chances of unseating Cranston. Immediately after conceding his loss, he announced <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> candidate for the position in the next election in 1990. He again faced Cranston in the election, but Cranston withdrew from the race due to a battle with prostate cancer. Ford maintained that he had enough commitments of support in the Democratic caucus to have won without Cranston's withdrawal. When majority leader George J. Mitchell retired from the Senate in 1994, Ford showed some interest in the Democratic floor leader post. Ultimately, he decided against it, choosing to focus instead on Kentucky issues. He supported Christopher Dodd for majority leader.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} campaign he faced Republican nominee Sean Bielat, a technology executive {{and member of the}} U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. Bielat had run an unsuccessful campaign against Barney Frank in the 2010 election for the 4th district seat. In a series of debates, Bielat challenged Kennedy's qualifications for Congress, saying that the Democrat's campaign was coasting on name recognition rather than experience, and that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> party-line vote. Kennedy tried to tie Bielat to the budget platform of U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, although Bielat responded that he only supported parts of the plan. Kennedy raised over $4 million in support of his campaign, far exceeding Bielat's draw of around $900,000. Kennedy won the November 6 election with 61 percent of the vote to Bielat's 36 percent.|$|E

5|$|Jackson won the Democratic primary with 48% of {{the vote}} to Jones's 39%, with the rest {{of the vote}}s {{scattered}} among the other three candidates. The Republicans nominated Thomas Somer. Since the district was overwhelmingly Democratic, Jackson was the favorite for the December 12, 1995 special election. Jackson won the general election with 76% of the vote; his victory was widely anticipated. Upon his victory, Jackson made it known <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> liberal voice in opposition to Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich. He took office on December 15, 1995. Jackson was perceived as less charismatic than his father and less credentialed than his predecessor, but his family pedigree was expected to help him politically. In August 1996, Somer withdrew from a rematch leaving Jackson with no major party opposition in the November 1996 general election. As a result, Jackson received 94% of the vote in the general election.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{hoped that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{compromise}} {{candidate for the}} presidential nomination as the Democratic Party tore itself apart over the slavery question. Busy with the Homestead Bill during the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina, he sent two of his sons and his chief political adviser to represent his interests in the backroom deal-making. The convention deadlocked, with no candidate able to gain the required two-thirds vote, but the sides were too far apart to consider Johnson as a compromise. The party split, with Northerners backing Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas while Southerners, including Johnson, supported Vice President Breckinridge for president. With former Tennessee senator John Bell running a fourth-party candidacy and further dividing the vote, the Republican Party elected its first president, former Illinois representative Abraham Lincoln. The election of Lincoln, known to be against the spread of slavery, was unacceptable to many in the South. Although secession from the Union had not been {{an issue in the}} campaign, talk of it began in the Southern states.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} seven, Bede was sent, as a puer oblatus, to {{the monastery}} of Monkwearmouth by his family to be educated by Benedict Biscop and later by Ceolfrith. Bede does not say whether it was already {{intended}} {{at that point that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> monk. It was fairly common in Ireland at this time for young boys, particularly those of noble birth, to be fostered out as an oblate; the practice was also likely to have been common among the Germanic peoples in England. Monkwearmouth's sister monastery at Jarrow was founded by Ceolfrith in 682, and Bede probably transferred to Jarrow with Ceolfrith that year. The dedication stone for the church has survived to the present day; it is dated 23 April 685, and as Bede would have been required to assist with menial tasks in his day-to-day life it is possible that he helped in building the original church. In 686, plague broke out at Jarrow. The Life of Ceolfrith, written in about 710, records that only two surviving monks were capable of singing the full offices; one was Ceolfrith and the other a young boy, who according to the anonymous writer had been taught by Ceolfrith. The two managed to do the entire service of the liturgy until others could be trained. The young boy was almost certainly Bede, who would have been about 14.|$|E
