S. courts seeking damages for harms {{that have occurred}} abroad, attracted by higher expected returns than {{are available in the}} jurisdiction in which the harm arose. This paper focuses on the potential distortion of trade and investment patterns that can result from implicit discrimination in the applicability of liability rules to producers or investors of different nationalities due to such forum shopping. These distortions are akin to those caused by discriminatory tariff or tax policies and can reduce global economic welfare. In appropriate cases, the welfare costs can be averted by limiting foreign tort plaintiffs to the law and <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> the <b>jurisdiction</b> in which their harm arose, although such a rule is not efficient in all cases. The analysis has implications for a number of areas of legal doctrine, including the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>forum</b> non conveniens, the construction of the Alien Tort Statute, and the rules governing choice of law in transnational tort cases.

50|$|As {{the power}} of the Church extends not only to its {{individual}} members but also to the whole corporate body, not only to questions concerning the conscience but also to the public actions of its subjects, ecclesiastical jurisdiction is distinguished into that of the internal and external <b>forum.</b> The <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> the internal <b>forum</b> deals with questions concerning the welfare of individual Christians and with their relation to God. Hence it is called the <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> conscience (<b>Forum</b> conscientiae). It is also denominated the <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> Heaven (<b>forum</b> poli) because it guides the soul on the path to God. The internal forum is subdivided into the sacramental or penitential, which is exercised in the tribunal of penance or at least is connected with it, and the extra penitential forum. Causes concerning the private and secret needs of the faithful can often be expedited outside the sacramental confession. Thus, vows may be dispensed, secret censures may be absolved, occult impediments of matrimony may be dispensed outside of the tribunal of penance. The internal forum deals therefore directly with the spiritual welfare of the individual faithful. It has reference to the corporate body only secondarily, in as much as the good of the whole organization is promoted by that of the individual members. Owing {{to the nature of the}} civil state and the end for which it was instituted, it has no jurisdiction corresponding to the ecclesiastical <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> conscience. Finally, it may so chance that circumstances may bring about a conflict between the internal and external forum. Thus, for example, a marriage may be null and void in the <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> conscience, but binding in the external <b>forum</b> for want <b>of</b> judicial proofs to the contrary, and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|The Church's {{jurisdiction}} {{in the external}} forum has reference to matters touching the public and social good of the corporate body. It corresponds, consequently, very closely to the powers exercised by civil magistrates in affairs belonglng to their competence. While the external forum may busy itself with the concerns of individuals, it does so only in as far as these affect the public good. Thus the absolution of sins belongs to the internal forum, but the concession of the faculty for performing such absolution is an act <b>of</b> the external <b>forum.</b> The <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> the external <b>forum</b> is subdivided into voluntary and necessary. Voluntary, or extrajudicial, is that which a superior can exercise towards those who invoke his power, or even against those who are unwilling, but without his using the formalities prescribed in law. Necessary or contentious jurisdiction is that which the judge employs in punishing crimes or deciding disputes according to prescribed forms. In general, the acts <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> the external <b>forum</b> are the decision of disputes concerning faith, morals or discipline, the making and enforcing of laws, the punishment of transgressors of ecclesiastical statutes, and the like.|$|R
5000|$|The general {{principle}} reflects the maxim Actor sequitur forum rei, or, he who acts (the plaintiff) must follow the <b>forum</b> (or <b>jurisdiction)</b> <b>of</b> the thing involved (the {{subject of the}} lawsuit, meaning the defendant). This rule is presented in Article 2(1) (2012 recast: Article 4(1)) of the Regulation that ‘persons domiciled in a Member State shall, whatever their nationality, be sued in the courts of that Member State’. The law leans in favour of the defendant, since it is “more difficult, generally speaking, to defend oneself in the courts of a foreign country than in those of another town {{in the country where}} one is domiciled”. Furthermore, Article 2(2) of the Regulation embodies the [...] "principle of equality of treatment" [...] by stating that 'persons who are not nationals of the Member State in which they are domiciled shall be governed by the rules <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> applicable to nationals of that State'. Although this is the 'general' jurisdictional rule of the Regulation, it only comes after the other articles in hierarchy and allows for many exceptions, making its general character rather relative; however, the latter is still reflected throughout the Regulation in the way how all exceptions to this rule must be interpreted strictly.|$|R

40|$|With {{emerging}} new Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) and the stagnating of the Doha Round negotiations, {{the conflict}} of overlapping laws and jurisdictions between WTO tribunals and those of RTAs has become an important issue. That conflict should be addressed multilaterally and regionally. The examination of the DSU shows that the WTO treaty negotiators did not perceive potential conflicts <b>of</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> with RTAs. Since there is no general rule of primacy between WTO norms and those of RTAs, {{it has been suggested}} that the DSU (Dispute Settlement Understanding) should be amended and that under certain conditions choice <b>of</b> <b>forum</b> and/or exclusive <b>forum</b> clauses <b>of</b> RTAs could lead a panel to suspend jurisdiction until the issue has been cleared.

5000|$|The Church {{founded by}} Christ for the {{salvation}} of men needs, like every society, a regulating power (the authority of the Church). The Decree [...] "Lamentabili sane", of 3 July 1907, rejects the doctrine that Christ did not desire to found a permanent, unchangeable Church endowed with authority It is customary {{to speak of a}} threefold office of the Church: the office of teaching (prophetic office), the priestly office and the pastoral office (governing office), and therefore of the threefold authority of the Church: the teaching authority, ministerial authority and ruling authority. Since the teaching of the Church is authoritative, the teaching authority is traditionally included in the ruling authority; then only the ministerial authority and the ruling authority are distinguished. By ministerial authority, which is conferred by an act of consecration, is meant the inward, and because of its indelible character permanent, capacity to perform acts by which Divine grace is transmitted. By ruling authority, which is conferred by the Church (missio canonica, canonical mission), is understood the authority to guide and rule the Church <b>of</b> God. <b>Jurisdiction,</b> insofar as it covers the relations of man to God, is called <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> the internal <b>forum</b> or <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> Heaven (jurisdictio poli). (See Ecclesiastical Forum); this again is either sacramental or penitential, so far as it is used in the Sacrament of Penance, or extra-sacramental, e.g. in granting dispensations from private vows. Jurisdiction, insofar as it regulates external ecclesiastical relations, is called <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> the external <b>forum,</b> or briefly jurisdictio fori. This jurisdiction, the actual power of ruling is legislative, judicial or coactive. Jurisdiction can be possessed in varying degrees. It can also be held either for both fora, or for the internal forum only, e.g. by the parish priest. Jurisdiction can be further sub-divided into ordinary, quasi-ordinary and delegated jurisdiction. Ordinary jurisdiction is that which is permanently bound, by Divine law or human law, with a permanent ecclesiastical office. Its possessor is called an ordinary judge. By Divine law the pope has such ordinary jurisdiction for the entire Church and a bishop for his diocese. By human law this jurisdiction is possessed by the cardinals, officials of the Roman Curia and the congregations of cardinals, the patriarchs, primates, metropolitans, archbishops, the praelati nullius and prelates with quasi-episcopal <b>jurisdiction,</b> the chapters <b>of</b> orders or the superior generals of orders, cathedral chapters in reference to their own affairs, the archdiaconate in the Middle Ages, and parish priests in the internal forum. If however jurisdiction is permanently connected with an office, but the office itself is said to be quasi-ordinary, or jurisdictio vicaria. This form <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> is possessed, for example, by a vicar-general. Temporary exercise of ordinary and quasi-ordinary jurisdiction can be granted, in varying degrees, to another as representative, without conferring on him an office properly so called. In this transient form jurisdiction is called delegated or extraordinary, and concerning it canon law, following the Roman law, has developed exhaustive provisions. This development began when the popes, especially since Alexander III (1159-81), found themselves obliged, by the enormous mass of legal business which came to them from all sides as the [...] "judices ordinarii omnium" [...] to hand over, with proper instruction, a large number of cases to third parties for decision, especially in matters <b>of</b> contentious <b>jurisdiction.</b>|$|R
40|$|When private {{international}} law lawyers discuss jurisdiction, focus is typically placed primarily on personal jurisdiction, and secondarily on subject matter jurisdiction.

40|$|The {{recasting}} of the Brussels I regulation {{has been}} {{announced by the}} European Commission in December 2010. The author argues that its impact will be felt in third countries, too. If the Commission proposal is adopted, defendants domiciled in non-EU countries will be amenable to suit in the courts of the Union in civil and commercial matters under the heads <b>of</b> special <b>jurisdiction</b> defined in the EU Regulation. National rules <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> will no more be applicable. Two new heads <b>of</b> general <b>jurisdiction</b> applicable in case there is no jurisdiction under the Regulation (i. e. when the defendant is domiciled outside the EU {{and there is no}} ground <b>of</b> special <b>jurisdiction</b> for EU courts) will be the <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> property and the forum necessitates. A court within the EU will have discretion to stay the proceedings in case of lis pendens before the court of a third country. Judgments from third countries will continue to be recognized pursuant to national rules, including the national rules on indirect jurisdiction. Finally, forum selection clauses in favor of third country courts will most likely be unenforceable in the EU unless the court within the EU would anyway lack jurisdiction (even without the forum selection clause). These rules are only a proposal and they may still be changed. The Commission could make a significant improvement by small interventions in the proposed text, e. g. by giving the rules on exclusive jurisdiction reflexive effect and introducing a specific provision affording effect to prorogation clauses in favor of third country courts...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} Regulation (EU) No 1215 / 2012 (Brussels I Recast) on the Italian rules governing international litigation, as embodied in the Statute of 1995 that reformed the Italian system of private international law. As regards jurisdiction, almost no consequences derive from the Regulation. Article 3 (2) of the 1995 Statute does make a reference to uniform European provisions in this area (so as to extend their applicability beyond their intended scope), but it still refers, for this purpose, to the 1968 Brussels Convention. The Author contends that if a legislative reform of the Statute provided for a <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> necessity, this would ultimately give a suitable basis to the trend of Italian courts in favour of a broad interpretation of the heads <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> resulting from the said reference, no matter whether such broad interpretation departs from the usual interpretation of the corresponding heads <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> laid down in the Convention. By contrast, the Regulation has a mixed bearing on the domestic regime for the recognition and enforcement of judgments. On the one hand, differently from national rules, the European rules now allow foreign judgments to be enforced internally merely by operation of law. On the other hand, the Regulation, if compared with domestic rules, provides more broadly for the opportunity of scrutinising whether individual judgments are entitled to recognition or not...|$|R
