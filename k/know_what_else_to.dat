500|$|Although Canning {{wrote that}} [...] "the writers did {{a fine job}} of {{incorporating}} the tenure, Will's terrible Spanish and the songs into the storylines", Will's lack of Spanish skills was questioned by other reviewers. Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch said this did not [...] "seem to gel with the passionate Will Schuester I remember from season 1", and Slezak expressed surprise that [...] "he hadn't even mastered the basics of the language!", as did Chaney. Slezak also said Will, as evidenced by his [...] "La Cucaracha" [...] rendition for his class, was [...] "suddenly dumb as the cardboard box that Finn winningly turned into a robot head", and Chaney commented, [...] "Mr. Schuester always seemed a bit more sensitive than this." [...] VanDerWerff wrote of [...] "the weird, dark despair {{at the heart of}} Will's plight: He's a high school Spanish teacher, and he mostly is that because he doesn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] He added, [...] "I think this was probably the best episode for the character since early season one." [...] Canning stated that [...] "the tension between Will and Emma was a welcome change", and Votta commented on the episode's less dramatic ending with Will's apology and [...] "celebrating Emma's new-found tenure with a dinner" [...] with the conclusion, [...] "sometimes you don't need a big bang to get oomph out of an episode". Chaney, however, was puzzled as to why Emma was given teaching tenure [...] "when she's been working at McKinley as a guidance counselor and handing out absolutely horrifying self-made pamphlets".|$|E
500|$|Collins {{decided to}} record {{it in the}} late 1960s amid an {{atmosphere}} of counterculture introspection; {{she was part of}} an encounter group that ended a contentious meeting by singing [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] as it was the only song to which all the members knew the words. Her producer was present and suggested she include a version of it on her 1970 album Whales & Nightingales. Collins, who had a history of alcohol abuse, claimed that the song was able to [...] "pull her through" [...] to recovery. It was recorded in St. Paul's, the chapel at Columbia University, chosen for the acoustics. She chose an a cappella arrangement that was close to Edwin Othello Excell's, accompanied by a chorus of amateur singers who were friends of hers. Collins connected it to the Vietnam War, to which she objected: [...] "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do about the war in Vietnam. I had marched, I had voted, I had gone to jail on political actions and worked for the candidates I believed in. The war was still raging. There was nothing left to do, I thought... but sing 'Amazing Grace'." [...] Gradually and unexpectedly, the song began to be played on the radio, and then be requested. It rose to number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining on the charts for 15 weeks, as if, she wrote, her fans had been [...] "waiting to embrace it". In the UK, it charted 8 times between 1970 and 1972, peaking at number 5 and spending a total of 75 weeks on popular music charts. [...] Her rendition also reached number 5 in New Zealand and number 12 in Ireland in 1971.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Many reviews criticized the episode's {{lack of a}} cohesive plot. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a C rating, saying, Pool Party' was so loosely structured that it relied heavily on the characters to carry the narrative, {{and the result was}} some languid storytelling which gave me way too much time to think about missed opportunities, failed experiments, and the increasing burden of a show without any momentum." [...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote, [...] "There were bits and pieces of each story that worked in 'Pool Party,' but neither Robert's stroll through parties never had, nor Erin's endeavor to make Andy jealous, came together to make completely funny or interesting tales." [...] The Huffington Post wrote that, [...] "Once , the plot bits were so loose it might have been difficult for casual fans to follow it all." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, Pool Party' was one of those episodes where you can tell the writers didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do.... This is filler, really, which unfortunately tends to be unavoidable when you do 22-episode seasons and you're eight years in." [...] Many reviews were critical of the continued Erin-Andy romance taking center-stage. McNutt wrote, [...] "I still really do not care about Andy and Erin as a relationship. The show's approach to this storyline... is to have Andy enjoying a fairly normal evening with his girlfriend Jessica while Erin acts like a crazy person {{in an effort to get}} his attention." [...] Forecella noted that, while the Erin and Dwight pairing was funny, their attempts to make Andy jealous were not successful, as Andy's sub-plots were deemed not funny and [...] "boring." ...|$|E

While he allows Conrad {{two days a}} week off to see Dr. Berger and stays late with him to work out on the other days, Conrad does not like him. He only begrudgingly allowed Conrad to rejoin the team, and once told Conrad that a friend of his with similar problems had [...] "been in and out of institutions his entire life". When Dr. Berger says that remark may have been simply a sign that he didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> say, Conrad responds that it was simply [...] "stupid".|$|E

2500|$|According to Donnelly, {{the band}} {{had been working}} {{together}} for five years, stating that if she didn't have the band, she wouldn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do with her life. She described the band {{as a work of}} passion, citing sources of influences such as the bands Misfits, Blondie and Iron Maiden, and singer Courtney Love. The Misfits in particular were a large influence to the album; their horror themed and often purposely over-the-top style to making music were important in shaping the way the band presented themselves in image. Donelly expressed an interest with progressing the style of music on their sophomoric effort, stating that she wanted to have a tighter focus this time around, and specifically noting that the song titles on Fantastic Wounds were more direct and confident in nature. Speaking about the creation of the project, she mused: ...|$|E
2500|$|Shyamalan {{commented on}} the issues {{regarding}} fans' perceptions of the casting {{in an interview with}} Washington Post columnist Jen Chaney, saying, [...] "Anime is based on ambiguous facial features. It's meant to be interpretive. It's meant to be inclusive of all races, and you can see yourself in all these characters...This is a multicultural movie and I'm going to make it even more multicultural in my approach to its casting. There's African-Americans in the movie...so it's a source of pride for me. The irony that [...] would label this with anything but the greatest pride, that the movie poster has Noah and Dev on it and my name on it. I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] In this quote, Shyamalan's reference to Noah Ringer can be explained by Noah's self-identification of his ancestry as [...] "American Indian," [...] although critics of the film's casting have presumed that the actor is simply [...] "white" [...] when making their complaints.|$|E

40|$|This {{national}} {{report form}} the Coalition for Juvenile Justice (CJJ) finds that detaining youth charged with offenses in locked facilities while awaiting their hearings {{has become an}} automatic catchall response across the United States. As a result, many young people with mental health, substance abuse and family problems [...] {{most of whom are}} 15 years or younger, nonviolent and disproportionately youth of color [...] are needlessly swept into locked facilities. Although detention can be useful for offenders who may be dangerous to others or themselves, or who may flee a court hearing, in reality it has become a hidden closet where youth are sent when no one <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do with them. According to CJJ, more than 27, 000 American children and teens reside in secure detention facilities on any given day, some of whom will be acquitted or released. Moreover, this number has increased 72 % in the last decade despite a simultaneous drop in juvenile crime. The report further demonstrates that detaining juveniles is more likely to increase rather than decrease future offending, and cites exemplary efforts designed {{to reduce the number of}} youth who inappropriately flow into confinement and to provide family- and community-based alternatives that better utilize limited public resources...|$|R
60|$|The {{man made}} a long oration to us, {{as we could}} see by his gestures; and we {{sometimes}} heard his voice, but knew not one word he said.

40|$|Abstract. There {{are many}} people working on {{genealogy}} throughout the world. Unfortunately, {{much of their time}} is spent duplicating the work of others or doing work that will be done again later. This paper discusses the reasons behind this duplication of efforts.

The proposed methods also make it possible for genealogists to do work just once that can then benefit everyone. 1...|$|R
