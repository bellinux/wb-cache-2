The healing nature of artistic experience, Rank believed, affirms difference but, paradoxically, also [...] "leads to the release <b>from</b> <b>difference,</b> <b>to</b> the feeling of unity with the self, with the other, with the cosmos" [...] (Rank, 1929-31, p. 58). In art, microcosm meets macrocosm. Of the uncanny feeling of emotional unity we experience in surrendering ourselves—giving up temporarily the burden of our difference—to the Other in art, Rank writes in Art and Artist: [...] "It produces a satisfaction which suggests that it is more than a matter of the passing identification of two individuals, that it is the potential restoration of a union with the Cosmos, which once existed and was then lost. The individual psychological root of this sense of unity I discovered (at the time of writing The Trauma of Birth, 1924) in the prenatal condition, which the individual in his yearning for immortality strives to restore. Already, in that earliest stage of individualization, the child is not only factually one with the mother but beyond that, one with the world, with a Cosmos floating in mystic vapors in which present, past, and future are dissolved. The individual urge to restore this lost unity is (as I have formerly pointed out) an essential factor in the production of human cultural values" [...] (Rank, 1932/1989, p. 113).|$|E

The production of hierarchies in the arenas of governance is discussed, defending {{the hypothesis that the}} shift <b>from</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> inequality is the result of practices of justification that consolidate the sovereignty of technical competence in environmental management. Some of the more significant findings of studies about the structure and functioning of River Basin Committees in different regions of the country are taken as reference for this discussion. Based on these findings, we discuss the discursive production of the Committees, the authority of the agents that embody the new principles of management, and the implications of the process of scientification of the politics. The article concludes by pointing out the importance of diversity in {{the construction of a new}} narrative of environmental governance...|$|E

40|$|This article {{develops}} {{an analysis}} of diversity in two ways. We start with a theoretical discussion {{of the ways in}} which diversity has been approached within psychology, showing the competing arguments that have been developed that connect diversity, community, and multiculturalism. We show that not only are there psychological consequences to contemporary experiences of increased diversity but also that fundamental psychological capacities—such as self-consciousness, identity, and dialogue—actually stem from the experience of diversity. This has important implications for diversity management policies. The second part of the article gives an empirical illustration of how diversity is experienced in schools across England drawing on 13 interviews with senior staff and 11 focus groups with pupils aged between 12 and 14 years old. We discuss three themes related to experiences of diversity: (1) <b>from</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> diversity, (2) real and imagined mobility across communities, and (3) collaborative practices, projects, and knowledge. What the empirical examples show is that critically engaging with diversity can be a more productive project than practices which construct diversity in terms of distinct groups that need respect and tolerance. Hence we argue approaches that promote engaging with diversity rather than traditional diversity management are more in line with foundational psychological insights as well as empirical research findings...|$|E

Methods and materials: 68 patients (patient group A) {{were treated with}} 40 Gy in 10 fractions delivered by field-in-field, forward-planned IMRT. Isotoxic regimens with decreasing number of fractions were calculated using Biological Effective Dose (BED) to the breast. Risk for RIF in hypofractionated treatment was predicted by calculating NTCP from DVHs of group A rescaled to fractions and dose of novel regimens. Moderate/severe RIF was prospectively scored during follow-up. Various NTCP models, with and without incomplete repair correction, were assessed <b>from</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> observed incidence of RIF. In order to verify the value for α/β of 3 Gy assumed for breast, we fitted α/β to observed incidences of moderate/severe RIF. Results: Treatments with 35 Gy/ 7 f and 28 Gy/ 4 f were selected for the fraction reduction protocol. 75 patients (group B) were treated in 35 Gy/ 7 f. Incidence of moderate/severe RIF was 5. 9 % in group A, 5. 3 % in group B. The NTCP model with correction for incomplete repair had lowest difference from observed RIF. The α/β obtained from fitting was 2. 8 (95 %CIs 1. 1 - 10. 7) Gy. Conclusions: The hypofractionated regimen was well tolerated. The model for NTCP corrected for incomplete repair was the most accurate and an assumed α/β value of 3 Gy is consistent with our patient data. The hypofractionation protocol is continuing with patients treated with 28 Gy/ 4 f. © 2015 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{the most}} {{exciting}} productions of operas have attracted attention by rebelling against established ideas of the opera's text and stagings - Peter Sellars' New York settings of Mozart operas are just one example among many. Likewise, the most stimulating developments in opera criticism {{have been in the}} area of performance, where a much-needed sharpening of opera-production theory has formed around such extraordinary re-stagings. This focus on performance is a welcome one, particularly for opera, where the visual component is of no less importance than the aural. Yet the nearly exclusive attention on extraordinary productions and a concomitant valorization of the provocative is troubling. Such selectivity, particularly when founded on loaded criteria such as "strong" and "innovative" runs the risk of creating more canons of "great works" or "great men. "This dissertation will seek to redress some of the problems with current methodologies for studying opera productions, illustrated with case studies of four of Leos Janacek's operas: Kat'a Kabanova, The Cunning Little Vixen, The Makropulos Case, and From the House of the Dead. My thinking on this subject has been filtered through work on Janacek's operas which, I have found, fit uneasily into existing models of opera studies. Unlike the Italian, German, and French operas that form the canon of opera criticism, Janacek's were notoriously slow starters. Only the premieres of his last few operas could be considered important musical events and even then only within the Czech Republic. Works such as Makropulos and The House of the Dead have acquired significance in international opera houses only relatively recently. The unusual relationship these pieces have with the operatic performance canon required developing new approaches to their study. First, I propose supplementing any examination of opera production with the very different information reception history provides. Alone, neither production nor reception can completely represent the impact of performance: on the one hand, the visual traces of productions, particularly those pre-dating video recording, are frustratingly ephemeral; on the other, the written texts that usually comprise reception history tell only part of the story. Bringing the two together, can fill in some of the pieces missing in either alone. Second, the myopic effect caused by focusing on single productions should be countered: as Gundula Kreuzer has recently argued, studies of newer productions often lack historical perspective. Thus I suggest along with Kreuzer, that the chronological purview of any such study be radically expanded to include stagings from the premiere up to recent years. Lastly, I suggest a shift in focus <b>from</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> sameness. Reception histories in music have typically concentrated on changes in a work's meaning as indicators of shifts in broader historical, social, or political contexts. The problem with looking exclusively for difference is, as Jim Samson has argued, that a work's meanings may become so unstable as to render them meaningless. Tracing sameness or, to borrow from Jan Broeckx, "residual layers of receptional insight" through the history of an opera's production and reception not only reintroduces stability through continuously regenerated meanings of the work, but also provides us with new insights...|$|E
