The amount of the outermost layers that is lost depends on the size and the material of the planet and the distance from the star. In a typical system a gas giant orbiting 0.02 AU around its parent star loses 5-7% of its mass during its lifetime, but orbiting closer than 0.015 AU can mean evaporation of the whole planet except for its core.|$|R
40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} photochemical-dynamic {{model is}} used to study <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>loss</b> of hydrogen from a primitive, water-rich atmosphere on Venus. The escape flux is calculated {{as a function of}} the H 2 O mixing ratio at the atmospheric cold trap. The cold trap mixing ratio is then related in an approximate fashion to the H 2 O concentration in the lower atmosphere. Hydrodynamic escape should have been the dominant loss process for hydroogen when the H 2 O mass mixing ratio in the lower atmosphere exceeded approximately 0. 1. The escape rate would have depended upon the magnitude of the solar ultraviolet flux and the atmospheric EUV heating efficiency and, to a lesser extent, on the O 2 content of the atmosphere. The time required for Venus to have lost the bulk of a terrestrial ocean of water is on the order of a billion years. Deuterium would have been swept away along with hydrogen if the escape rate was high enough, but some D/H enrichment should have occurred as the escape rate slowed down...|$|R
40|$|Electricity can be {{produced}} directly with reverse electrodialysis (RED) from the reversible mixing of two solutions of different salinity, for example, sea and river water. The literature published so far on RED was based on experiments with relatively small stacks with cell dimensions less than 10 × 10 cm 2. For {{the implementation of the}} RED technique, it is necessary to know the challenges associated with a larger system. In the present study we show the performance of a scaled-up RED stack, equipped with 50 cells, each measuring 25 × 75 cm 2. A single cell consists of an AEM (anion exchange membrane) and a CEM (cation exchange membrane) and therefore, the total active membrane area in the stack is 18. 75 m 2. This is the largest dimension of a reverse electrodialysis stack published so far. By comparing the performance of this stack with a small stack (10 × 10 cm 2, 50 cells) {{it was found that the}} key performance parameter to maximal power density is the hydrodynamic design of the stack. The power densities of the different stacks depend on the residence time of the fluids in the stack. For the large stack this was negatively affected by the increased <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>losses</b> due to the longer flow path. It was also found that the large stack generated more power when the sea and river water were flowing in co-current operation. Co-current flow has other advantages, the local pressure differences between sea and river water compartments are low, hence preventing leakage around the internal manifolds and through pinholes in the membranes. Low pressure differences also enable the use of very thin membranes (with low electrical resistance) as well as very open spacers (with low <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>losses)</b> in the future. Moreover, we showed that the use of segmented electrodes increase the power output by 11 %. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThermosensitive {{fluorescent}} nanoparticles seeded in {{de-ionized water}} {{have demonstrated the}} presence of strong thermal gradients in two-phase cavitating microflows. A thermal mapping has been {{made possible by the}} use of a confocal microscope, focusing and scanning over the three dimensions of a microchannel interrupted by a microdiaphragm. Working with DI water with flow rates of around 1 liter/ hour, cavitation is here the consequence of high shear rates downstream a diaphragm of hydraulic diameter of ≈ 77 µm. A thermal gradient ≈ 105 K/m has been detected only when the two-phase flow is present. It is located in vortical structures associated with eddies in the shear layers. Thermal profiles have been recorded at different heights of the channel, in the area where the flow exhibits the strongest thermal gradient. The increase of temperature is associated with an increase of the void fraction. That last parameter is reached by considering the spatial variations of the thermally - normalized intensity of the emitting nanoprobes. We believe that overheating is the consequence of the breakdown of large structures into small structures, and of the ultimate conversion of kinetic energy into heat. As the onset of cavitation goes with a drop of the flowrate, a model combining the corresponding <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>losses</b> to the thermal effects has been established. It demonstrates that the intensity of the thermal gap is enhanced by the microsizes of the device. Meanwhile, the effect of heat transfer due to phase change need to be considered...|$|E
40|$|Solutions to the {{radiation}} diffusion equation predict the absorbed energy (''wall loss'') within an inertial confinement fusion (ICF) hohlraum. Comparing supersonic vs. subsonic solutions {{suggests that a}} high Z metallic foam as hohlraum wall material will reduce <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>losses,</b> and hence, net absorbed energy by {approx} 20 %. We derive an analytic expression for the optimal density (for any given drive temperature and pulse-length) that will achieve this reduction factor and which agrees well with numerical simulations. This approach can {{reduce the cost of}} a reactor driver. Radiation heat waves, or Marshak waves, {{play an important role in}} energy transport and in the energy balance of laser, z-pinch and heavy ion beam hohlraums for ICF and high energy density physics experiments. In these experiments, a power source, e. g. a laser, delivers energy to the interior of a high Z cavity that is converted to x-rays. Typically, most of the energy is absorbed in a thin, diffusively heated layer on the hohlraum interior surface, and re-emission from the heated layer sets {{the radiation}} temperature T achieved in the hohlraum. In our recent paper, (henceforward referred to as HR) we developed an analytic theory of Marshak waves via a perturbation theory using a small parameter {var_epsilon} = {beta}/(4 + {alpha}) where the internal energy varies as T{sup {beta}} and the opacity varies as T{sup -{alpha}}. A consistent theory was built up order-by-order in {var_epsilon}, with the benefits of good accuracy and order-by-order energy conservation. We first derived analytic solutions for supersonic Marshak waves, which remarkably allowed for arbitrary time variation of the surface temperature. We then solved the full set of subsonic equations, though specialized to the case that the surface temperature varies as t{sup k}, where self-similar solutions can be found. Our solutions compared very well with exact analytic solutions (for the specialized cases for which they exist) and with radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. In this paper we apply those results to the following question: Can we save on driver energy by making hohlraum walls out of low density high Z foams, which have less hydrodynamic motion and hence, reduced net absorbed energy by the walls? We answer this question using our HR analytic theory, as well as by numerical simulations. To the degree that the ''pure'' HR theory diverges from the simulations we derive non-ideal non-self-similar corrections to the theory that bring it into agreement with the simulations. We show that low-density high Z foams can indeed bring a savings of {approx} 20 % in the required driver energy. Remarkably, this reduction is universal- independent of drive T and its pulse-duration {tau}. We derive an analytic expression for the optimal density (for any given T and {tau}) that will achieve this reduction factor and which agrees very well with numerical simulations. For a nominal 5 B$ ICF reactor driver of 5 MJ, this 20 % savings could save 0. 5 - 1 B$.

40|$|The gas giant {{planets in}} the Solar System have a retinue of icy moons, {{and we expect}} giant exoplanets to have similar {{satellite}} systems. If a Jupiter-like planet were to migrate toward its parent star the icy moons orbiting it would evaporate, creating atmospheres and possible habitable surface oceans. Here, we examine how long the surface ice and possible oceans would last before being hydrodynamically lost to space. The <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>loss</b> rate from the moons is determined, in large part, by the stellar flux available for absorption, which increases as the giant planet and icy moons migrate closer to the star. At some planet-star distance the stellar flux incident on the icy moons becomes so great that they enter a runaway greenhouse state. This runaway greenhouse state rapidly transfers all available surface water to the atmosphere as vapor, where it is easily lost from the small moons. However, for icy moons of Ganymede's size around a Sun-like star we found that surface water (either ice or liquid) can persist indefinitely outside the runaway greenhouse orbital distance. In contrast, the surface water on smaller moons of Europa's size will only persist on timescales greater than 1 Gyr at distances ranging 1. 49 to 0. 74 AU around a Sun-like star for Bond albedos of 0. 2 and 0. 8, where the lower albedo becomes relevant if ice melts. Consequently, small moons can lose their icy shells, which would create a torus of H atoms around their host planet that might be detectable in future observations.

40|$|Evolution of Mars' {{noble gases}} through {{two stages of}} {{hydrodynamic}} escape early in planetary history has been proposed previously by the author. In the first evolutionary stage of this earlier model, beginning at a solar age of approximately 50 m. y., fractionating escape of a H 2 -rich primordial atmosphere containing CO 2, N 2, and the noble gases in roughly the proportions found in primitive carbonaceous (CI) chondrites is driven by intense extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) leads to a long (approximately 80 m. y.) period of quiescence, followed by an abrupt degassing of remnant H 2, CO 2, and N 2 from the mantle and of solar-composition noble gases lighter than Xe from the planet's volatile-rich accretional core. Degassed H refuels <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>loss</b> in a waning but still potent solar EUV flux. Atmospheric Xe, Kr, and Ar remaining {{at the end of}} this second escape stage, approximately 4. 2 G. y. ago, have evolved to their present-day abundances and compositions. Residual Ne continues to be modified by accretion of solar wind gases throughout the later history of the planet. This model does not address a number of processes that now appear germane to Martian atmospheric history. One, gas loss and fractionation by sputtering, has recently been shown to be relevant. Another, atmospheric erosion, appears increasingly important. In the absence then of a plausible mechanism, the model did not consider the possibility of isotopic evolution of noble gases heavier than Ne after the termination of hydrodynamic escape. Subsequent non-thermal loss of N was assumed, in an unspecified way, to account for the elevation of N from the model value of approximately 250 percent at the end of the second escape stage to approximately 620 percent today. Only qualitative attention was paid to the eroding effects of impact on abundances of all atmophilic species prior to the end of heavy bombardment approximately 3. 8 G. y. ago.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of the loss of Mars {{atmospheric}} constituents by solar-wind-induced sputtering and by photochemical escape during the past 3. 8 billion years. Sputtering is capable of efficiently removing species from the upper atmosphere, including the light noble gases; nitrogen and oxygen are removed by photochemical processes as well. Due to diffusive separation (by mass) above the homopause, removal {{from the top of the}} atmosphere will fractionate the isotopes of each species, with the lighter mass being preferentially lost. For carbon and oxygen, this allows us to determine the size of nonatmospheric reservoirs which mix with the atmosphere; these reservoirs can be CO 2 adsorbed in the regolith and H 2 O in the polar ice caps. We have constructed both simple analytical models and time-dependent models of the loss of volatiles from and supply to the martian atmosphere. Both argon and neon require continued replenishment from outgassing over geologic time. For argon, sputtering loss explains the fractionation of (Ar- 36) /(Ar- 38) without requiring a distinct epoch of hydrodynamic escape (although fractionation of Xe isotopes still requires very early <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>loss).</b> For neon, the current (Ne- 22) /(Ne- 20) ratio represents a balance between loss to space and continued resupply from the interior; the similarity of the ratio to the terrestrial value is coincidental. For nitrogen, the loss by both sputtering and photochemical escape would produce a fractionation of (N- 15) /(N- 14) larger than observed; an early, thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere could mitigate the nitrogen loss and produce the observed fractionation, as could continued outgassing of juvenile nitorgen. Based on the isotopic constraints, the total amount of carbon dioxide lost over geologic time is probably on the order of tens of millibars rather than a substantial fraction of a bar. The total loss from solar-wind-induced sputtering and photochemical escape, therefore, does not seem able to explain the loss of a putative thick, early atmosphere withput requiring formation of extensive surface carbonate deposits or other nonatmospheric reservoirs for CO 2...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} parameter in {{the reduction}} of fuel consumption of heavy-duty diesel engines is the Power Cylinder Unit (PCU); the PCU is the single largest contributor to engine frictional losses. Much attention, from both academia and industry, {{has been paid to}} reducing the frictional losses of the PCU in the boundary and mixed lubrication regime. However, previous studies have shown that a large portion of frictional losses in the PCU occur in the hydrodynamic lubrication regime. A novel texturing design with large types of surface features was experimentally analyzed using a tribometer setup. The experimental result shows a significant reduction of friction loss for the textured surfaces. Additionally, the textured surface did not exhibit wear. On the contrary, it was shown that the textured surfaces exhibited a smaller amount of abrasive scratches on the plateaus (compared to the reference plateau honed surface) due to entrapment of wear particles within the textures. The decrease in hydrodynamic friction for the textured surfaces relates to the relative increase of oil film thickness within the textures.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} reverse {{electrodialysis}} (RED) {{is to produce}} electricity upon the mixing of two solutions. We studied the power density (W/m 2) and the energy efficiency (the amount of energy produced from specified volumes of river and sea water {{in relation to the}} thermodynamic maximum). With a stack of 50 cells (of 10 cm Ã— 10 cm), a power density of 0. 93 W/m 2 was obtained with artificial river water (1 g NaCl/L) and artificial sea water (30 g NaCl/L), which is the highest practical value reported for RED. This value is achieved due to an optimized cell design using a systematic measurement protocol. The main factor in the power density is the cell resistance. With the used membranes (Fumasep FAD and FKD) and a spacer thickness of 200 Î¼m, a cell resistance of 0. 345 Î© is measured under RED conditions. This is about one and a half times the value as expected from the contribution of the individual components. This high value is probably caused by the shielding effect of the spacers. The largest contribution to this resistance (about 45 %) is from the river water compartment. The <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>loss</b> resulted in a maximal net power density of about 0. 8 W/m 2 at a flow rate of 400 mL/min. At this optimum the consumed power for pumping is 25 % of the total generated energy. The majority of the pump power is lost in the manifolds. Multistage experiments were performed at maximal power conditions (a current density of about - 30 A/m 2 and at a flow rate of 300 mL/min). At these conditions the theoretical energy efficiency is maximal 50 %. In practice however, the energy efficiency of a single stack is 9 %. The effluent concentrations of the so operated stack are used for a second experiment and so on, simulating a multistage operation. With 3 stages a cumulative energy efficiency of 18 % is achieved. A fourth stage did not increase this value. The power density of the 3 stages together was 50 % of the power density of the first stage, indicating that energy efficiency and power density are counteracting. Further increase of power density and energy efficiency can be obtained with a better spacer and manifold design. A more open spacer is beneficial for RED in two ways: less shielding and lower pressure drop. Less shielding decreases the electrical resistance of the cell. A lower pressure drop permits the use of thinner water compartments, resulting again in a decreased electrical resistance of the cell and an improvement of the power density. ...|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{emissions}} is a {{top priority}} within heavy duty diesel engine development and research. The aim {{of the work is}} to decrease the fuel consumption by decreasing frictional losses of the Power Cylinder Unit. Full scale testing of engine components improvements is time-consuming and costly. It is however possible to simplify the testing of engine components by pilot tribometer testing, enabling cost-effective screening of candidate material concepts. This thesis work answers the following research questions: 1. How should a pilot tribometer test be constructed in order to replicate the frictional and wear behaviour of the engine in the boundary, mixed and hydrodynamic lubrication regimes? 2. What part of the surface morphology of the cylinder liner surface affects the frictional behaviour of the different lubrication regimes? In this thesis work the tribometer test approach was further developed to study a wider range of the Stribeck curve. Several different surfaces were analysed using the developed tribometer test approach, the results showed that the plateau part of the cylinder liner surface was responsible for controlling the frictional response in the boundary and mixed lubrication regimes. The results of these experiments were compared with single cylinder engine tests which were also conducted in this thesis work. The result of the engine tests and the tribometer test were in contradiction, the surface exhibiting low frictional losses in the tribometer exhibited high fuel consumption in the engine test. In evaluating this difference it was determined {{that the majority of the}} frictional losses were governed by the contribution of hydrodynamic friction and that a smoother plateau surface increased the hydrodynamic friction. The results of the engine testing were reproduced using a tribological simulation tool. It is possible to decrease the <b>hydrodynamic</b> friction <b>losses</b> by decreasing the viscosity of the engine oil; however, this measure could increase the boundary frictional losses. To decrease the <b>hydrodynamic</b> friction <b>losses</b> in this thesis work a novel type of texturing was investigated in tribometer experiments.

The results from the tribometer test show that a significant reduction in the hydrodynamic friction can be accomplished by applying textures on the cylinder liner surface. Based on the results from the experiments with textures a design proposal is put forward, in this a specification texture design in full scale is given. Suggestions for future work include development of manufacturing techniques for machining textures on the cylinder liner, optimization of texture geometry by e. g. using a mesh-free calculation method, and design of a tribometer test with the aim of only distinguishing the hydrodynamic friction response of different surface morphologies...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{physical}} processes of impact cratering on planetary surfaces and atmospheres {{as well as}} collisions of finite-size self-gravitating objects is vitally important to planetary science. The observation has often been made that craters are the most ubiquitous landform on the solid planets and the satellites. The density of craters is used to date surfaces on planets and satellites. For large ringed basin craters (e. g. Chicxulub), the issue of identification of exactly what 'diameter' transient crater is associated with this structure is exemplified by the arguments of Sharpton et al. (1993) versus those of Hildebrand et al. (1995). The size of a transient crater, such as the K/T extinction crater at Yucatan, Mexico, which {{is thought to be}} the source of SO,-induced sulfuric acid aerosol that globally acidified surface waters as the result of massive vaporization of CASO, in the target rock, is addressed by our present project. The impact process excavates samples of planetary interiors. The degree to which this occurs (e. g. how deeply does excavation occur for a given crater diameter) has been of interest, both with regard to exposing mantle rocks in crater floors, as well as launching samples into space which become part of the terrestrial meteorite collection (e. g. lunar meteorites, SNC's from Mars). Only {{in the case of the}} Earth can we test calculations in the laboratory and field. Previous calculations predict, independent of diameter, that the depth of excavation, normalized by crater diameter, is d(sub ex) /D = 0. 085 (O'Keefe and Ahrens, 1993). For Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 (SL 9) fragments impacting Jupiter, predicted excavation depths of different gas-rich layers in the atmosphere, were much larger. The trajectory and fate of highly shocked material from a large impact on the Earth, such as the K/T bolide is of interest. Melosh et al. (1990) proposed that the condensed material from the impact upon reentering the Earth's atmosphere induced. radiative heating, and producing global firestorms. The observed reentry splash of the SL- 9 impact-induced plumes that reimpact Jupiter (Boslough et al., 1994) supported Melosh's K/T model. The fate of early primitive planetary atmospheres during the latter stages of planetary accretion, resulting from impactors in the 100 to 103 km diameter require modeling, e. g. Newman et al. (1997). Ahrens (1990; 1993) and Chen and Ahrens (1997) found that upon delivery of most of the impact energy to the solid planet, very large ground motions arise, which couple sufficient kinetic energy to the atmosphere to cause substantial atmospheric escape. The trade-off of this model with that of Cameron (1997) who suggests that atmospheric blow-off occurs as a result of the massive impact-induced heating of the atmosphere and Pepin (1997) who uses this heating event to model differential <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>loss</b> of lighter atmospheric gases, requires further research...|$|R

It results in raising of the front wheels of the vehicle above the road surface under the action of a <b>hydrodynamic</b> force and <b>loss</b> of vehicle control. The methods ensuring traffic safety on road sections, where vehicle’s aquaplaning is possible, should be developed by identifying and improving these sections at the stages of highway design, reconstruction and maintenance and by limiting traffic speed of vehicles.

40|$|Biofouling is {{the natural}} {{association}} of sessile marine animals and plants encrusting submerged hard substrata and steady structures, the biotic composition and succession of which depends on geographic place, type of substratum, physico-chemical characteristics of the seawater and seasonal climatic conditions. In the lagoon of Venice, the climax of this biocoenosis is reached in summer-autumn and is represented by colonial ascidians of the Botryllinae family as dominant species. Macrofouling growing on artificial objects constantly immersed in the seawater causes severe economic damages, which result in continuous maintenance of the structures and high costs due to <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>loss</b> of the boats also involving a sensitive increase in fuel consumption and atmospheric pollution. Therefore, the study of antifouling compounds from 1970 s {{with the introduction of}} organotin compounds as principal biocides is fundamental for the future of naval engineering with which it parallelly evolved. However, the severe disadvantages for environmental impact of organotins involved a strict international regulation of their employment with the purpose of reaching their total elimination within 2008. As a consequence, from 1990 s, the research of alternative biocides, to be applied as antifoulings in paints for covering immersed objects, remarkably increased aiming to produce new chemical formulations effective on the biofouling and also compatible with the preservation of marine ecosystem. The purpose of our research was to evaluate the effects of some new antifouling paints in commerce, containing Cu 2 O, CuSCN, Sea-Nine 211, Diuron, TCMS pyridine, Zinc pyrithione, Zineb and Endosulfan as principal or booster biocides, on the ecological succession of hard substratum macrofouling employing wooden and steel panels immersed for one year in two stations of the southern Venice lagoon, different for bathymetric and hydrodynamic characteristics. Some biodiversity indexes (species richness, biocoenosis structure, covering-abundance index, similarity index) were used to describe the evolution of biocoenosis. Results, compared with control and TBT-treated panels, enabled us to highlight the disturbing activity of the antifouling paints, that results in the selection of resistant and dominant species, often different to those of the natural climax. We have established an order of biocidal efficacy of the assayed antifouling paints: TCMS pyridine, Diuron, Irgarol 1051 < Cu 2 O, CuSCN, Zn pyrithione, Zineb, Endosulfan, Sea-Nine 211 < TBT. None of the paints assayed is more powerful than that containing TBT and the biocidal efficacy depends on the type of matrix (hard or self-polishing) and the presence of biocidal boosters able to enlarge the toxic effect. In consideration that the wide use of these antifouling paints is accompanied by a continuous leaching of their active substances in the environment, our data evidence the dangerousness of these xenobiotics towards the coastal marine biocoenoses, in particular to fragile ecosystems like the lagoon of Venice and suggest the necessity of a revival of a more careful toxicological study of the paints already in commerce and a research of new antifouling systems which don't use chemical biocides.

40|$|Lowering {{lubricant}} viscosity {{to reduce}} friction generally carries {{a side effect}} of increased metal-metal contact in mixed or boundary lubrication, for example near top ring reversal along the engine cylinder liner. A strategy to reduce viscosity without increased metal-metal contact involves controlling the local viscosity away from top-ring-reversal locations. This paper discusses the implementation of insulation or thermal barrier coating (TBC) as a means of reducing local oil viscosity and power cylinder friction in internal combustion engines with minimal side effects of increased wear. TBC is selectively applied to the outside diameter of the cylinder liner to increase the local oil temperature along the liner. Due to the temperature dependence of oil viscosity, the increase in temperature from insulation results in a decrease in the local oil viscosity. The control of local viscosity through TBC targets areas of high <b>hydrodynamic</b> power <b>losses</b> mid-stroke while avoiding an increase in boundary friction near ring reversal. If temperatures near ring reversal remain unaltered, the expected result is the same oil viscosity, boundary friction, and wear rate near TDC as that of a non-insulated liner. In order to calculate the frictional benefit of insulating the cylinder liner, an in-cylinder heat transfer model predicts the temperatures along the liner. The local oil temperatures and engine performance parameters are then applied to a ring pack simulation to calculate the contributions to hydrodynamic and boundary friction power loss. The BsFC and wear rate results are then compared to baseline simulation data for TBC performance metrics. The results show the TBC insulated liner maintains adequate viscosity and film thickness near TDC for wear protection in the ring, while decreasing a significant portion of hydrodynamic for friction power loss in the mid-stroke. For the case studied, TBC offers a 0. 7 % BsFC improvement from the reduction in power cylinder friction with no increase in the wear rate of the ring pack. by Mark Allen Molewyk. Thesis: S.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{differences}} between the thermodynamic behaviour of real and ideal gases are analysed to determine their influence on the processes of compression and expansion of a gas-charged accumulator. The behaviour of real gas has a significant influence on the size of accumulators used for Kinetic Energy Recovery of vehicles. In particular, it is underscored that the accumulator's design, based on ideal gas behaviour, provides undersized accumulators and therefore makes impossible the complete energy recovery for Hydraulic Energy Storage Systems (HES). The analysis of the thermodynamic properties of gases has shown that the main differences between ideal and real behaviour are due to gas compressibility. A mathematical model of a gas-charged accumulator is developed in order to analyse its real behaviour in presence of irreversible heat transfer and viscous losses. The simulation process of charging and discharging of a hydro-pneumatic accumulator, makes it clear that <b>hydrodynamic</b> and thermal <b>losses</b> are responsible for the characteristic hysteresis cycle on the p-V diagram. Different gases are tested as charged fluid of a hydro-pneumatic accumulator to simulate cyclic processes of charge and discharge. Results show different characteristics in terms of volumetric gas properties, thermal time-constant and thermal efficiency of the accumulator. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|By {{carefully}} {{controlling the}} concentration of alpha,omega-thiol polystyrene in solution, we achieved formation of unique monocyclic polystyrene chains (i. e., polymer chains with only one disulfide linkage). The presence of cyclic polystyrene was confirmed by its lower than expected molecular weight due to a lower <b>hydrodynamic</b> volume and <b>loss</b> of thiol groups as detected by using Ellman 2 ̆ 7 s reagent. The alpha,omega-thiol polystyrene was synthesized by polymerizing styrene {{in the presence of}} a difunctional RAFT agent and subsequent conversion of the dithioester end groups to thiols via the addition of hexylamine. Oxidation gave either monocyclic polymer chains (i. e., with only one disulfide linkage) or linear multiblock polymers with many disulfide linkages depending on {{the concentration of}} polymer used with greater chance of cyclization in more dilute solutions. At high polymer concentrations, linear multiblock polymers were formed. To control the MWD of these linear multiblocks, monofunctional X-PSTY (X = PhCH 2 C(S) -S-) was added. It was found that the greatest ratio of X-PSTY to X-PSTY-X resulted in a low M-n and PDI. We have shown that we can control both the structure and MWD using this chemistry, but more importantly such disulfide linkages can be readily reduced back to the starting polystyrene with thiol end groups, which has potential use for a recyclable polymer material...|$|R
40|$|The {{impacts of}} {{environmental}} change on ecological communities are poorly understood relative to impacts on species. Impacts on inter-community (beta-) diversity are particularly neglected. As a result, {{our ability to}} forecast the impacts of environmental change on communities, and on individual species constrained by those communities, is seriously limited. However, as conservation efforts increasingly emphasise broad-scale approaches in terms of multi-species coverage and spatial scale, {{it is imperative that}} understanding ofbiodiversity change at these scales is enhanced so that conservation can be based on appropriate scientific evidence. Within this thesis I aimed to conduct multi-species analyses over multi-decada 1 temporal scales at the spatial meso-sca 1 e to improve our understanding of such issues in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. I discussed my findings in the theoretical context of G 1 easonian and C 1 ementsian views of species distributions (i. e. limitations to individualistic species responses) and their impact at the community scale. The temporal extent provided the opportunity to empirically test emerging concepts, including non-analogous communities, biotic homogenization, metacommunities and climate tracking responses at an appropriate meso-sca 1 e. Although no evidence for nonanalogous communities was found, biotic homogenization was supported and appeared to be caused by increased nitrogen and decreased light availability. An intertidal assemblage also converged but appeared to be driven by a reduced sea surface temperature gradient. Woodland plant metacommunity structure was demonstrated to be C 1 ementsian for woodland plants despite experiencing biodiversity <b>loss.</b> <b>Hydrodynamic</b> features were demonstrated to act as meso-sca 1 e dispersal barriers that limited intertidal invertebrates in tracking of climate (sea surface temperature) over the last 20 years. These barriers appear to alter when modelled under a scenario of sea level rise. Overall, results suggest that species are responding individualistically but that these responses are bounded by extrinsic constraints. ...|$|R
