Wet {{deposition}} of toxic trace metals {{is the dominant}} mode of deposition in terrestrial ecosystems and contributes very significantly to their pollution burden. Wet deposited metals are dissolved in rainwater. They reach the vegatation in a form most favourable for uptake. Reliable analysis of toxic trace metals in rainwater is important {{in order to determine}} the impact they make on the environment. In this study, trace metals in rainwater and in dry deposition (as a control measure), have been analysed over a period of a year. These metals include cadmium, copper, cobalt, lead, nickel and zinc. The rainwater was filtered, acidified to pH 2 and irradiated with UV-light. Dry deposition samples, were digested by heating in nitric acid before analysis. Differential-pulse anodic stripping voltammetry was used to determine cadmium, lead and zinc. Copper was determined by adsorptive cathodic stripping at pH 7 after complexation with catechol. Cobalt and nickel were measured at pH 9 by adsorptive cathodic stripping after formation of their <b>dimethylglyoximes.</b> Sampling was done on a daily basis from April 1996 to March 1997, on the campus of the Peninsula Technikon. The samples were collected over a 24 -hour period. The total average concentration for the metals was 16. 11 flg/dm 3 for rainwater and 427 flg/dm 3 for dry deposition. Meteorological factors such as wind speed, humidity and temperature affect the distribution of pollutants and thus the trace metal levels. The levels of the metallic pollutants were thus evaluated against meteorological data. Differential-pulse stripping voltammetry is shown to be applicable for heavy metal analysis of rainwater...|$|R

50|$|The cobaloxime {{is slowly}} {{decomposed}} by acids and bases. With acids, {{the products of}} decomposition are <b>dimethylglyoxime,</b> cobalt salts, and pyridine; with bases, derivatives of other cobaloximes are formed, usually {{with the release of}} chloride ions.|$|E
50|$|For {{derivatives}} with phenyl or vinyl substituent, the Grignard {{reaction is}} employed. However, since the <b>dimethylglyoxime</b> ligands contains two acidic H {{atoms in the}} oxime group, the Grignard reagent must be used in three-fold excess to compensate the loss.|$|E

50|$|Polyethylene oxide, or {{high-molecular}} weight polyethylene glycol, is synthesized by suspension polymerization. It {{is necessary}} to hold the growing polymer chain in solution {{in the course of}} the polycondensation process. The reaction is catalyzed by magnesium-, aluminium-, or calcium-organoelement compounds. To prevent coagulation of polymer chains from solution, chelating additives such as <b>dimethylglyoxime</b> are used.|$|E
50|$|Oximes are {{commonly}} used as ligands and sequestering agents for metal ions. <b>Dimethylglyoxime</b> (dmgH2) is a reagent {{for the analysis of}} nickel and a popular ligand in its own right. In the typical reaction, a metal reacts with two equivalents of dmgH2 concomitant with ionization of one proton. Salicylaldoxime is a chelator and an extractant in hydrometallurgy.|$|E
50|$|Another common {{instance}} where precipitation occurs {{is when a}} metal cation {{interacts with}} an anionic ligand to form an electrically neutral complex. If the complex is hydrophobic, it will precipitate out of water. This occurs with the nickel ion Ni2+ and <b>dimethylglyoxime,</b> (dmgH2): {{in this case the}} lattice energy of the solid is not particularly large, but it greatly exceeds the energy of solvation of the molecule Ni(dmgH)2.|$|E

The salt Pt(NH3)5ClCl3 containing the chloropentammineplatinum(IV) ion, is called [...] "Chugaev's salt".

50|$|Boris Smirnov and Alexander Marchenko (USSR) {{discovered}} in 1975 that cobalt porphyrins {{are able to}} reduce the molecular weight of PMMA formed during radical polymerization of methacrylates.

Due to their lower oxygen sensitivity these catalysts have been investigated much more thoroughly than the porphyrin catalysts and are the catalysts actually used commercially.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dimethylglyoxime</b> is a {{chemical}} compound {{described by the}} formula CH3C(NOH)C(NOH)CH3. Its abbreviation is dmgH2 for neutral form, and dmgH for anionic form, where H stands for hydrogen. This colourless solid is the dioxime derivative of the diketone butane-2,3-dione (also known as diacetyl). DmgH2 {{is used in the}} analysis of palladium or nickel. Its coordination complexes are of theoretical interest as models for enzymes and as catalysts. Many related ligands can be prepared from other diketones, e.g. benzil.|$|E
50|$|The 1,2-diketimine ligands, {{also called}} α-diimines, include <b>dimethylglyoxime</b> {{as well as}} {{oxidized}} derivatives of o-phenylenediamine. The steric properties of the substituents on nitrogen provide a means to control the axial coordination sites on a square planar complex. Large planar substituents such as mesityl tend to be orthogonal to the MN2 plane. In this way, the axial coordination sites on a square planar complex are shielded. Such steric control is not possible for complexes of the related to 2,2'-bipyridine, glyoximate, and 9,10-phenanthroline ligands.|$|E
50|$|Dental {{composite}} resins are {{types of}} synthetic resins {{which are used}} in dentistry as restorative material or adhesives. Synthetic resins evolved as restorative materials since they were insoluble, aesthetic, insensitive to dehydration, easy to manipulate and reasonably inexpensive. Composite resins are most commonly composed of Bis-GMA and other dimethacrylate monomers (TEGMA, UDMA, HDDMA), a filler material such as silica and in most current applications, a photoinitiator. <b>Dimethylglyoxime</b> is also commonly added to achieve certain physical properties such as flow ability. Further tailoring of physical properties is achieved by formulating unique concentrations of each constituent.|$|E
50|$|Complexes of polydentate ligands {{are called}} chelate {{complexes}}. They {{tend to be}} more stable than complexes derived from monodentate ligands. This enhanced stability, the chelate effect, is usually attributed to effects of entropy, which favors the displacement of many ligands by one polydentate ligand. When the chelating ligand forms a large ring that at least partially surrounds the central atom and bonds to it, leaving the central atom at the centre of a large ring. The more rigid and the higher its denticity, the more inert will be the macrocyclic complex. Heme is a good example: the iron atom is at the centre of a porphyrin macrocycle, being bound to four nitrogen atoms of the tetrapyrrole macrocycle. The very stable dimethylglyoximate complex of nickel is a synthetic macrocycle derived from the anion of <b>dimethylglyoxime.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Thermometric titrimetry: Thermometric titrimetry is an {{extraordinarily}} versatile technique. This is differentiated from calorimetric titrimetry {{by the fact}} that the heat of the reaction (as indicated by temperature rise or fall) is not used to determine the amount of analyte in the sample solution. Instead, the equivalence point is determined by the rate of temperature change. Because thermometric titrimetry is a relative technique, it is not necessary to conduct the titration under isothermal conditions, and titrations can be conducted in plastic or even glass vessels, although these vessels are generally enclosed to prevent stray draughts from causing [...] "noise" [...] and disturbing the endpoint. Because thermometric titrations can be conducted under ambient conditions, they are especially well-suited to routine process and quality control in industry. Depending on whether the reaction between the titrant and analyte is exothermic or endothermic, the temperature will either rise or fall during the titration. When all analyte has been consumed by reaction with the titrant, a change in the rate of temperature increase or decrease reveals the equivalence point and an inflection in the temperature curve can be observed. The equivalence point can be located precisely by employing the second derivative of the temperature curve. The software used in modern automated thermometric titration systems employ sophisticated digital smoothing algorithms so that [...] "noise" [...] resulting from the highly sensitive temperature probes does not interfere with the generation of a smooth, symmetrical second derivative [...] "peak" [...] which defines the endpoint. The technique is capable of very high precision, and coefficients of variance (CV's) of less than 0.1 are common. Modern thermometric titration temperature probes consist of a thermistor which forms one arm of a Wheatstone bridge. Coupled to high resolution electronics, the best thermometric titration systems can resolve temperatures to 10−5K. Sharp equivalence points have been obtained in titrations where the temperature change during the titration has been as little as 0.001K. The technique can be applied to essentially any chemical reaction in a fluid where there is an enthalpy change, although reaction kinetics can play a role in determining the sharpness of the endpoint. Thermometric titrimetry has been successfully applied to acid-base, redox, EDTA, and precipitation titrations. Examples of successful precipitation titrations are sulfate by titration with barium ions, phosphate by titration with magnesium in ammoniacal solution, chloride by titration with silver nitrate, nickel by titration with <b>dimethylglyoxime</b> and fluoride by titration with aluminium (as K2NaAlF6) Because the temperature probe does not need to be electrically connected to the solution (as in potentiometric titrations), non-aqueous titrations can be carried out as easily as aqueous titrations. Solutions which are highly colored or turbid can be analyzed by thermometric without further sample treatment. The probe is essentially maintenance-free. Using modern, high precision stepper motor driven burettes, automated thermometric titrations are usually complete in a few minutes, making the technique an ideal choice where high laboratory productivity is required.|$|E

40|$|Reduction of pertechnetate by tin(II) in the {{presence}} of <b>dimethylglyoxime</b> is shown, by single crystal x-ray analysis, to yield a technetium-tin-dimethylglyoxime complex in which tin and technetium are intimately connected by a triple bridging arrangement. One bridge consists of a single oxygen atom and it is hypothesized that this bridge arises from the inner sphere reduction of technetium by tin(II), the electrons being transferred through a technetium "yl" oxygen which eventually becomes the bridging atom. Two additional bridges arise from two <b>dimethylglyoxime</b> ligands that function as bidentate nitrogen donors towards Tc and monodentate oxygen donors towards Sn. The tin atom can thus be viewed as providing a three-pronged "cap" {{on one end of the}} Tc-dimethylglyoxime complex. The additional coordination sites around Tc are occupied by the two nitrogens of a third <b>dimethylglyoxime</b> ligand, making the Tc seven-coordinate. The additional coordination sites around Sn are occupied by three chloride anions, giving the Sn a fac octahedral coordination environment. From indirect evidence the oxidation states of tin and technetium are tentatively assigned to be IV and V, respectively. Since most 99 mTc-radiopharmaceuticals are synthesized by the tin(II) reduction of pertechnetate, it is likely that the Sn-O-Tc linkage described in this work is an important feature of the chemistry of these species.
