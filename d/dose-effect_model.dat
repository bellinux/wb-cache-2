40|$|To explore whether {{psychotherapy}} {{models are}} applicable {{in the training}} clinic setting, the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>model</b> of psychotherapy outcome was tested in the outpatient clinic of an American Psychological Association-approved doctoral training program in clinical psychology. Outcome data, using the Outcome Questionnaire 45. 2, were gathered immediately prior to each psychotherapy session {{during the course of}} treatment (mean total number of sessions: 14. 81). Sixty-one clients, treated by 21 trainee clinicians, participated. Although a similar pattern emerged, response to treatment was not as rapid as the <b>dose-effect</b> <b>model</b> would predict. Ideas for future research are proposed. The <b>dose-effect</b> <b>model</b> of psychotherapy out-come (Howard, Kopta, Krause, & Orlinsky, 1986) emerged from meta-analytic findings spanning 30 years and has spawned renewed interest and research into psychotherapy re-search. However, those analyses did not exam-ine possible site differences (e. g., whether the site was a training clinic) in the dose-effect response. Nevertheless, the relationship between train-ing and treatment outcome has been examined in the literature for decades, and numerous stud-ies have suggested that training is not related to outcome (e. g., Elkin, Parloff, Hadley, & Autry, 1985; Strupp & Hadley, 1979).

40|$|Objective: There is {{an ongoing}} debate {{concerning}} how outcome variables change {{during the course of}} psychotherapy. We compared the <b>dose–effect</b> <b>model,</b> which posits diminishing effects of additional sessions in later treatment phases, against a model that assumes a linear and steady treatment progress through termination. Method: Session-by-session outcome data of 6, 375 outpatients were analyzed, and participants were categorized according to treatment length. Linear and log-linear (i. e., negatively accelerating) latent growth curve models (LGCMs) were estimated and compared for different treatment length categories. Results: When comparing the fit of the various models, the log-linear LGCMs assuming negatively accelerating treatment progress consistently outperformed the linear models irre- spective of treatment duration. The rate of change was found to be inversely related to the length of treatment. Conclusion: As proposed by the <b>dose–effect</b> <b>model,</b> the expected course of improvement in psychotherapy appears to follow a negatively accelerated pattern of change, irrespective of the duration of the treatment. However, our results also suggest that the rate of change is not constant across various treatment lengths. As proposed by the “good enough level” model, longer treatments are associated with less rapid rates of change...|$|E

40|$|Background and purpose: We {{evaluated}} dose distributions in the anorectum and {{its relation}} to acute gastrointestinal toxicities using dose surface maps in an image-guided (IG) IMRT and 3 D-conformal radiotherapy (3 D-CRT) population. Material and methods: For patients treated to 78 Gy with IG-IMRT (n = 260) or 3 D-CRT (n = 215), for whom acute toxicity data were available, three types of surface maps were calculated: (1) total anorectum using regular intervals along a central axis with perpendicular slices, (2) the rectum next to the prostate, and (3) the anal canal (horizontal slicing). For each toxicity, an average dose map was calculated for patients with and without the toxicity and subsequently dose difference maps were constructed, 3 D-CRT and IG-IMRT separately. P-values were based on permutation tests. Results: Dose distributions in patients with grade >= 2 acute proctitis were significantly different from dose distributions in patients without toxicity, for IG-IMRT and 3 D-CRT. At the cranial and posterior rectal site, in areas receiving moderate dose levels (approximate to 25 - 50 Gy), dose differences up to 10 Gy were identified for IG-IMRT. For pain, cramps, incontinence, diarrhea and mucus loss significant differences were found as well. Conclusions: We demonstrated significant relationships between acute rectal toxicity and local dose distributions. This may serve as a basis for subsequent <b>dose-effect</b> <b>modeling</b> in IG-IMRT, and improved dose constraints in current clinical practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|No RIVM {{report number}} in publicationThe use of {{satellite}} data to construct ground level UV-radiation maps offers {{a unique opportunity}} to investigate geographical and temporal variability of ground level UV-radiation levels related to atmospheric changes, like ozone depletion or cloud changes. The calculation of long term yearly UV-doses in combination with <b>dose-effect</b> <b>models</b> for UV-related effects, like skin cancer, further enhances the application of UV-maps as a powerful tool to support environmental assessments. This report describes the results obtained in the CUBEO-project: a Climatology of Ultraviolet Budgets using Earth Observation. The project aimed at the development and validation of UV-mapping methods that can be applied in environmental assessments. The results indicated that the satellite derived cloud correction provides accurate and representative results if the ground albedo is low. The comparison with ground based UV-measurements at different sites in Europe shows an agreement for the yearly UV-dose within 10 %. An indication of the long term stability of the UV-mapping methods is obtained by means of a systematic comparison of UV-doses derived from ground based ozone and cloud data and doses derived from satellite observations over a period of nearly 20 years. The European maps of changes in UV-budgets at the ground and associated excess skin cancer risks have been reported in national and international state of the environment reports published by the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and/or the European Environmental Agency (EEA). These state of the environment reports contribute to the provision of information necessary for framing and implementing sound and effective environmental policies.

40|$|Source of support: Departmental sources Background: The {{direct effects}} of {{etomidate}} were investigated on the secretion of cortisol and its precursors by dispersed {{cells from the}} adrenal cortex of human of animals. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is an anesthetic agent that may interfere with cortisol secretion via an unknown mechanism, such as involving inhibition of 11 b-hydroxylase and the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme system. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether dex-medetomidine (DEX) has a similar inhibitory effect on adrenocortical function, and whether combined use of etomidate (ETO) and DEX could produce a synergistic action in inhibiting the secretion of human adrenocorti-cal hormones. Material/Methods: Human adrenocortical cells were exposed to different concentrations of ETO and DEX. The <b>dose-effect</b> <b>model</b> between the ETO concentration and the mean secretion of cortisone (CORT) and aldosterone (ALDO) per hour was estimated. Results: Hill’s equation well-described the dose-effect correlation between the ETO concentration and the amount of ALDO and CORT secretion. When the DEX concentration was introduced into the model by using E 0 (basal se-cretion) as the covariate, the goodness of fit of the ETO-CORT <b>dose-effect</b> <b>model</b> was improved significantly and the objective function value was reduced by 4. 55 points (P< 0. 05).

Participants were drawn from two datasets in the Swedish primary care (n = 640) and adult psychiatric care (n = 249). The participants made session-wise ratings on the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM). Multilevel analyses indicated a better fit using the GEL-model, with some reservations concerning RCSI and patterns of change.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Until now, {{it remains}} elusive which {{strategy}} - antithyroid drug withdrawal or increased radioiodine target doses - should be preferred {{to avoid the}} detrimental effect of antithyroid drugs in high- and low-dose radioiodine therapy, respectively. METHODS: We explored the effects of carbimazole on the 1 -year post-radioiodine success and hypothyroidism rates by continuous <b>dose-effect</b> <b>models,</b> whereas success was defined as elimination of hyperthyroidism. Euthyroidism rates with and without carbimazole were calculated by numerical integration of the area between success and hypothyroidism curves. Target dose amplification factors for equal chance of success with and without carbimazole were calculated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-eight patients were included in this study. Radioiodine target doses between 33 and 839 Gy were applied. Overall, the euthyroidism rates were 16. 5 % and 64. 8 %, while the hypothyroidism rates were 37. 6 % and 14. 8 % in Graves' disease and toxic nodular goitre, respectively. The success rate with simultaneous carbimazole (median dose 15 mg day(- 1); range 2. 5 - 60 mg day(- 1)) was reduced over the entire target dose range in Graves' disease and toxic nodular goitre. The areas between curves for euthyroidism without and with simultaneous carbimazole were 127 and 43 Gy in Graves' disease and 178 and 128 Gy in toxic nodular goitre. The estimated radioiodine target dose amplification factor was 5. 5 for Graves' disease and 3. 0 for toxic nodular goitre. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous carbimazole reduces the euthyroidism rate, the aim of low-dose radioiodine therapy, over the entire target dose range in both Graves' disease and toxic nodular goitre. Therefore, antithyroid drug discontinuation should be preferred in low-dose radioiodine therapy. Conversely, escalation of the target dose should be preferred in high-dose radioiodine therap...|$|R
40|$|No RIVM {{report number}} in {{publication}} UV-budget maps (the geographical distribution of effective UV at ground level) {{can be derived}} from satellite data. These UV-budget maps visualise changes in effective UV caused by ozone depletion and changes in cloud cover and aerosol content. Alterations in UV-budget maps over time give - in combination with <b>dose-effect</b> <b>models</b> for UV-induced effects - insight in the associated risks for human health and the environment. This report describes the results of the RUBEO-project: calculating Risks and Ultraviolet Budgets using Earth Observation (RUBEO). RUBEO aims at a better cloud parameterisation and incorporating temporal and spatial resolution for surface albedo, aerosol content and tropospheric ozone content. The geographical distribution of ozone and UV climatology and trends over Europe are analysed, and a cost-benefit analysis of satellite based UV budget mapping is provided. The UV-budget mapping can be applied using TOMS and GOME ozone data. A large scale statistical analysis of cloud effects is given comparing ISCCP and TOMS based remote sensing methods with cloud effects derived from ground measurements. Both satellite derived methods correlate well (r 0. 93) with the ground based analysis. Correction for non-zero albedo, under clear sky conditions, adds maximal 8 % to the yearly effective UV-budget. Temporal and spatial differences in aerosol optical thickness and tropospheric ozone content, result in a decrease in effective UV of 3 % for every 0. 1 increase in aerosol optical thickness, and in a decrease in effective UV of 4 % for every 10 DU increase in tropospheric ozone. Stratospheric ozone trends of - 1 to - 4 % per decade observed over Europe correspond to a 0. 5 to 4 % increase in skin cancer weighted effective UV. The largest trends are seen in the central part of Western Europe. At present satellite based UV-budget maps form a functional basis for trend analysis and risk assessment. However, satellite data and ground-based observations are both indispensable. Maps for changing UV-budgets and associated skin cancer risks have been used in 'state of the environment', reports. Such overviews, regularly published by the Dutch National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and the European Environmental Agency (EPA), support the evaluation and formulation of adequate environmental policies.

40|$|This thesis in {{the field}} of {{microdata}} analysis aims to introduce dose optimizing algorithms for the pharmacological management of Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD is a neurodegenerative disease that mostly affects the motor functions of the patients and it is characterized as a movement disorder. The core symptoms of PD are: bradykinesia, postural instability, rigidity, and tremor. There is no cure for PD and the use of levodopa to manage the core symptoms is considered the gold standard. However, long term use of levodopa causes reduced medication efficacy, and side effects, such as dyskinesia, which can also be attributed to overmedication. When that happens precise individualized dosing schedules are required. The goal of this thesis is to examine if algorithmic methods can be used to find dosing schedules that treat PD symptoms and minimize manifestation of side effects. Data from three different sources were used for that purpose: data from a clinical study in Uppsala University hospital in 2015, patient admission chart data from Uppsala University hospital during 2011 - 2015, and data from a clinical study in Gothenburg University during 2016 - 2017. The data were used to develop the methods and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. The first algorithm that was developed was a sensor-based method that derives objective measurements (ratings) of PD motor states. The construction of the sensor index was based on subjective ratings of patients’ motor functions made by three movement disorder experts. This sensor-based method was used when deriving algorithmic dosing schedules. Afterwards, a method that uses medication information and ratings of the patients’ motor states to fit individual patient models was developed. This method uses mathematical optimization to individualize specific parameters of <b>dose-effects</b> <b>models</b> for levodopa intake, through minimizing the distance between motor state ratings and dose-effect curves. Finally, two different dose optimization algorithms were developed and evaluated, that had as input the individual patient models. The first algorithm was specific to continuous infusion of levodopa treatment, where the patient’s state was set to a specific target value and the algorithm made dosing adjustments to keep that patients motor functions on that state. The second algorithm concerned oral administration of microtables of levodopa. The ambition with this algorithm was that the suggested doses would find the right balance between treating the core symptoms of PD and, at the same time, minimizing the side effects of long term levodopa use, mainly dyskinesia. Motor state ratings for this study were obtained through the sensor index. Both algorithms followed a principle of deriving a morning dose and a maintenance dose for the patients, with maintenance dose being an infusion rate for the first algorithm, and oral administration doses at specific time points for the second algorithm. The results showed that the sensor-based index had good test-retest reliability, sensitivity to levodopa treatment, and ability to make predictions in unseen parts of the dataset. The dosing algorithm for continuous infusion of levodopa had a good ability to suggest an optimal infusion rating for the patients, but consistently suggested lower morning dose than what the treating personnel prescribed. The dosing algorithm for oral administration of levodopa showed great agreement with the treating personnel’s prescriptions, both in terms of morning and maintenance dose. Moreover, when evaluating the oral medication algorithm, {{it was clear that the}} sensor index ratings could be used for building patient specific models...|$|R
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarGroundwater {{is a very}} {{important}} source for public water supply in the Netherlands since approximately 65 % of total public water supply relies on groundwater. Although fresh groundwater is available in considerably large quantities, groundwater is becoming a scarce national recource. Scarcity is mentioned with special reference to the effects of groundwater withdrawal on agricultural production and the desiccation of nature reserves. Groundwater withdrawal is one of the causes, but intensified land drainage and the regulation of surface water levels also contribute substantially to the lowering of groundwater levels. A study was carried out to analyse the impact assessment for the next decades of different groundwater extraction scenarios on the value and distribution of terrestrial ecosystems (especially with regard to vegetation). Several computer programmes have either been used or developed for this study. Throughout the project intensive use was made of the features of the Geographical Information System. The hydrological effects of changes in groundwater withdrawal have been calculated with the RIVM National Groundwater Model for the Netherlands (LGM). The changes in the amounts of inlet water were calculated with the RWS/RIZA model, DEMand GENerator (DEMGEN). The hydrological doses calculated with LGM and DEMGEN are input for the eco-hydrological <b>Dose-Effect</b> <b>Model</b> for terrestrial NATure (DEMNAT- 2). With this model it is possible to predict changes in the completeness of terrestrial ecosystems within a grid cell of 1 km 2. The results of this study are recorded in 15 separate reports, each covering one or more specific topics. The overall results are summarized in this particular report...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Predominant {{methods for}} {{analyzing}} dose – or concentration–effect data (i. e., probit analysis) {{are based on}} the concept of individual tolerance or individual effective dose (IED, the smallest characteristic dose needed to kill an individual). An alternative explanation (stochasticity hypothesis) is that individuals do not have unique tolerances: death results from stochastic processes occurring similarly in all individuals. These opposing hypotheses were tested with two types of experiments. First, time to stupefaction (TTS) was measured for zebra fish (Brachydanio rerio) exposed to benzocaine. The same 40 fish were exposed during five trials to test if the same order for TTS was maintained among trials. The IED hypothesis was supported with a minor stochastic component being present. Second, eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) were exposed to sublethal or lethal NaCl concentrations until {{a large portion of the}} lethally exposed fish died. After sufficient time for recovery, fish sublethally exposed and fish surviving lethal exposure were exposed simultaneously to lethal NaCl concentrations. No statistically significant effect was found of previous exposure on survival time but a large stochastic component to the survival dynamics was obvious. Repetition of this second type of test with pentachlorophenol also provided no support for the IED hypothesis. We conclude that neither hypothesis alone was the sole or dominant explanation for the lognormal (probit) model. Determination of the correct explanation (IED or stochastic) or the relative contributions of each is crucial to predicting consequences to populations after repeated or chronic exposures to any particular toxicant.

40|$|The <b>Dose-Effect</b> <b>Model</b> for {{terrestrial}} NATure (DEMNAT) is a {{model for}} the nationwide prediction of effects of water management measures on vegetation. For scenario analyses with DEMNAT geographical data on vegetation (ecotope groups), soil and groundwater (ecoseries) and hydrological doses are combined. Effects can either be expressed as changes in the completeness (or relative species richness) of ecotope groups, or as changes in nature value. This allows combining changes in various ecotope groups, weighed relative to their significance for nature conservation. With DEMNAT both damage and recovery due to water management measures can be calculated. To this end, separate dosis-effect functions for damage and recovery were defined, as recovery is often less rapid or incomplete. For the National Policy Plan on Drinking Water and Industrial Water Supply which was to be accompanied by an Environmental Impact Assessment eight basic scenarios were evaluated. A scenario is defined by a percentual change in the amount of groundwater withdrawn in a certain way (e. g. from phreatic groundwater) and for a pre-defined application. As substantial amounts of groundwater are withdrawn from ice-pushed ridges, the largest effects occur around the ridges. Smaller effects occur over larger surfaces, especially at the Holocene alluvial plains along the boundary of the elevated Pleistocene parts of the Netherlands. Ecotope groups of nutrient-poor, weakly acid sites are the most severely influenced by most scenarios. A comparison of the results of each scenario with the reference situation shows that various scenarios may add substantially to the recovery of wet and moist ecotope groups...|$|E

Dose fractionation studies (subcutaneous colistin sulphate at 1. 25 - 160 mg/kg/day) were conducted in neutropenic mice in which infection (three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and three strains of Acinetobacter baumannii) had been produced by intramuscular thigh injection or aerosol lung delivery. Bacterial burden was measured at 24 h after initiation of colistin treatment. Plasma protein binding was measured by rapid equilibrium dialysis and ultracentrifugation. The inhibitory sigmoid <b>dose-effect</b> <b>model</b> and non-linear least squares regression were employed to determine the relationship between exposure to unbound colistin and efficacy. Plasma binding of colistin was constant over the concentration range ∼ 2 - 50 mg/L. The average ± SD percentage bound for all concentrations was 92. 9  ±  3. 3 % by ultracentrifugation and 90. 4  ±  1. 1 % by equilibrium dialysis. In the thigh model, across all six strains the antibacterial effect of colistin was well correlated with fAUC/MIC (R(2)  =  0. 82 - 0. 94 for P. aeruginosa and R(2)  =  0. 84 - 0. 95 for A. baumannii). Target values of fAUC/MIC for 2 log 10 kill were 7. 4 - 13. 7 for P. aeruginosa and 7. 4 - 17. 6 for A. baumannii. In the lung model, for only two strains of P. aeruginosa and one strain of A. baumannii was it possible to achieve 2 log 10 kill (fAUC/MIC target values 36. 8 - 105), even at the highest colistin dose tolerated by mice. This dose {{was not able to}} achieve bacteriostasis for the other two strains of A. baumannii. Colistin was substantially less effective in lung infection.
