The researchers of the literature review into shared value found no single framework for shared value or inclusive business models.

The PHRs in use or in development today support a myriad of different functions, and consequently offer <b>different</b> <b>value</b> <b>propositions.</b> A comprehensive value analysis of PHRs has never been conducted; such analysis is needed to identify those PHR functions that yield the greatest value to PHR stakeholders. Here we present a framework that could serve as a foundation for determining the value of PHR functions and thereby help optimize PHR development. While the value framework is specific to the domain of PHRs, the authors have successfully applied the associated evaluation methodology in assessing other health care information technologies...|$|E

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of shared business models, hospitality and tourism consumers {{are faced with the}} decision to accept <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> from various service providers, including traditional, collaborative and shared. Grounded in service-dominant logic, theory of acceptance, theory of value, self-determination theory and generational theory, this dissertation examines why consumers accept <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> from service providers and what drives customers to collaborate with front-line employees. The research uses three studies that utilized a destination resort context with a mixed factorial equal cells experimental design. Study 1 utilized a 3 (generations) x 3 (business models) x 4 (<b>value</b> <b>propositions)</b> factorial between-within subjects design. Study 2 manipulated independent self-determination factors and used 3 (generations) x 2 (customers vs. employees) x 2 (strong or weak SDT factor) x 4 (<b>value</b> <b>propositions).</b> Study 3 extended study 2 by examining the additive effects of self-determination factors. The new conceptual framework of propositions-acceptance-collaboration was tested. This study is the first to simultaneously examine <b>different</b> <b>value</b> <b>proposition</b> results in three different business models and explore the differences between customers and employees in perceptions of collaboration. Mediation effects of co-created value and levels of acceptances on personal, organizational and collaborative results were tested and established.

Before, airport planning used to follow broad political goals and extensive governmental regulation. Airports were mere providers of infrastructure that favoured the construction of monumental facilities, often reflecting a kind of national or regional pride. This form of airport planning and design became a paradigm that still applies for many major airports. Liberalisation of the air transport market has {{played a key role in}} reshaping the entire aviation industry. Low-Cost Carriers (LCC) have proliferated in liberalised markets and have disrupted the industry by offering a <b>different</b> <b>value</b> <b>proposition</b> and operative model with impacts in traditional airlines and airports alike. The emergence of LCCs allowed underused airports and former military bases, particularly in Europe and the United States, to grow significantly. Yet, as the low-cost segment matures, LCCs move to bigger airports to keep growing. The impact of this trend for airport {{strategic planning}} is not clear in the existing literature...|$|R

The literature focuses on the integration of security activities into agile development processes. However, detailed prescriptions for security work would be misplaced in a generic management framework like Scrum. Therefore we {{take a closer look at}} the tensions between Scrums way of organizing work and the characteristics of security requirements. Our previous work suggests that Scrum works well as a management model and security development requires iterations as in agile development, yet Scrum teams can fail to address security needs due to their low visibility, competing objectives, and Scrums division of labor. Tensions ar ise as Scrum is optimized to fulfill explicit requirements and maximize business value, whereas security is often an implicit requirement with a <b>different</b> <b>value</b> <b>proposition,</b> which nevertheless requires substantial work and cannot be addressed by bug fixing or quality assurance alone. As a consequence, promising research directions are the reflective discovery of security needs, the valuation and prioritization of security work, collaboration between Scrum teams and security experts, and verification and feedback mechanisms for security...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to adopt}} service-dominant logic (SDL) to empirically explore network {{configurations}} {{resulting from the}} provision of goods, goods and services, and solutions. Design/methodology/approach – This paper uses a single, in-depth, exploratory case study in a truck manufacturer and its supply network. An abductive approach is adopted. In total, 54 semi-structured interviews were conducted. Findings – Three value propositions are clearly discernible within the truck provider. These range from a truck to a “solution”. These propositions have different supply network configurations: dyadic, triadic and tetradic. The extent to which different network actors contribute to value co-creation varies across the offerings. Research limitations/implications – This paper {{is based on a}} single, in-depth case study developed in one industrial context. Whilst this represents an appropriate approach given the exploratory nature of the study, further empirical investigation is needed across different industries. Originality/value – This paper {{is one of the first}} to empirically examine supply networks using SDL. A rich understanding of the challenges faced by a truck manufacturer in providing <b>different</b> <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> and the resulting network configurations are discussed. In so doing, evidence is provided of a more complex, tetradic network configuration for solutions, with varying degrees of interplay between actors in the flow of operand and operant resources to create value...|$|E
40|$|Brazilian Trade Contractors (TC), or Subcontractors and Specialty Contractors, are main {{players in}} the Brazilian Building Industry competitiveness. They {{are part of a}} highly fragmentized and {{informal}} chain, with a great diversity in their value propositions and in their organizational forms. Nonetheless, despite their heterogeneity, most of them are SMEs lacking resources, capabilities, and other assets. This lack of assets and a competition led by the lowest bid offering produces the bankruptcy of 50 % of them in their fourth year of operation, with negative consequences in the competitiveness of the whole Industry. Hence, understanding the causes of that performance is an important issue to improve TC management practices and, consequently, their performance. This paper focuses on internal factors, specifically, on the internal processes that allow Trade Contractors to achieve a good performance in their specific competitions. For this purpose, data were gathered from a qualitative research in 24 Trade Contractors with good performance and in 7 other agents that hire them, mainly in Sao Paulo - Brazil. Two are the main results: First, fourteen processes conducted by TC were identified. Second, those processes are performed in different configurations in accordance with <b>different</b> <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> and size of the TC...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{propose that}} {{designing}} a manufacturer’s equipment-based service value proposition in outcome-based contracts is {{the design of}} a new business model capable of managing threats to the firm’s viability that can arise from the contextual variety of use that customers may subject the firm’s value propositions. Furthermore, manufacturers need to understand these emerging business models as the capability of managing both asset and service provision to achieve use outcomes with customers, including emotional outcomes such as customer experience. Service-Dominant logic proposes that all “goods are a distribution mechanism for service provision,” upon which they propose a value-centric approach to understanding the interactions between the asset and service provision, and suggest a viable systems approach towards reorganising the firm to achieve such a business model. Three case studies of B 2 B equipment-based service systems were analysed to understand customers’ co-creation activities in achieving outcomes, in which the authors found that the co-creation of complex multi-dimensional value could be delivered through the <b>different</b> <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> of the firm catering to different aspects (dimensions) of the value to be co-created.

40|$|Historically, {{retailing}} {{was carried}} out in traditional store format, with minor non- store variation, like catalogue selling, direct sailing and telemarketing till the last decade of twentieth century. Even those non- store formats were restricted among fringe players, while big retail houses concentrated more on on-land business model. The last decade witnessed a wide metamorphosis in the retailing business. Propelled by growth in technological innovation, mainly World Wide Web the retail industry is evolving to serve the more convenience and value seeking shoppers. As a result, retailers are venturing into multi-format structure to deliver higher <b>value</b> <b>proposition</b> to the shoppers. But adoption of new formats brings with it opportunities, as well as, threats. The fall-out can be distinguished into three heads: 1) When a patron of the parent format switches occasionally or permanently to another format, even of the same retail brand, he/she seeks an altogether <b>different</b> <b>value</b> <b>proposition.</b> 2) While switching of format, the shopper carries to the new format the expectations, built on shopping experience and perceived brand image. If expectation are disconfirmed, shoppers engage in constructive processing that can result in revised brand image 3) As a consequence, retailer's success (or failure) in synchronisation of delivering and communicating retail <b>value</b> <b>proposition</b> across formats, results into reinforcement (or distortion) of retailer's brand image. The present article attempts to bring out the nature and dimensions of threats and opportunities faced by the retailers and its consequence {{in the light of the}} above mentioned issues. It is hypothesised that a retailer with multi-format system would need to define, design and deliver integrated values across the formats and there by creating consistent brand image...|$|R
40|$|The paper's unique {{contribution}} is {{to confirm the}} rationale for {{and the benefits of}} applying constructs from the psychological contract literature to generate deeper insights into the service provider-consumer relationship. Findings confirm the need for providers to target <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> at particular consumer groups as part of a more sophisticated and nuanced approach to customer segmentation. The paper also recognises possible changes in consumer expectation and how proactive service providers can track and respond to these. The conceptual framework and research propositions generated from it should be tested in organisations representative of transactional, relational and transpersonal service providers to provide deeper insights for researchers and practitioners. Analysis shows how alignment of <b>different</b> types of <b>value</b> <b>proposition</b> with consumer expectations impacts on the nature and level of consumer commitment. Customer commitment can also contribute to service provider reputation and brand equity. The model is developed by the integration of approaches from the marketing, CSR and psychological contract literature and represents a holistic and multi-disciplinary perspective on the service <b>value</b> <b>proposition.</b> The paper develops a conceptual framework to show how service provider <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> and customer purchase decisions represent the offer and acceptance of types of psychological contract that, if satisfied, result in particular levels of consumer commitment and related attitudinal and behavioural outcomes...|$|R

Due to socio-economic implications of entrepreneurship, the study focused on entrepreneurs as its unit of analysis. In the study, Hofstede’s (1980, 2001) cultural framework was used to construct ethnic values. Results indicate that significant differences exist in only two out of five value dimensions.

40|$|After {{decades of}} {{industrial}} manufacturing markets have become saturated which {{is followed by}} decreased growth in sales, increased competition, and razor thin profit margins. This opens up for a new field of business competition, the aftermarket. Delivering value over time for customers is now a competitive advantage with too much potential to overlook. The after-market differs from regular industrial inventory management by being managed by service-levels based on probability distributions as break-downs occur randomly. This review aims at investigating {{the potential benefits of}} using multiple-sourcing/ delivery modes and assessing available models {{in the context of the}} after-market. Three categories in the field are outlined: strategy, emergencydelivery, and order-splitting, each with significantly <b>different</b> <b>value</b> <b>propositions.</b> Aspects such as risk mitigation, importance of supplier competition, and operational flexibility are being discussed. Seven models from the category “Emergencydelivery” are subjected to a closer inspection where two models could be of further interest. It is found that a majority of available models are based on back-order penalties, thus not feasible in practise. No model that caters to the formulated problem has been found, nor seem to exist due to complexity. Instead, an alternative problem is suggested and formulated as a matching problem which approaches the multiple-sourcing/delivery concept from an aggregate level. Syncron is recommended to keep using the same approach as today and investigate the suggested problem instead...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} paper examines how foundations—foreign and domestic, public and private, operating and grant making engage with Chinese civil society organisations in an authoritarian political context. In contrast to previous literature, which considers civil society {{through the lens}} of state-society relations, the author contends {{that in the case of}} China, civil society-building has been a foundation-led process. Following a discussion of conceptual caveats in the nascent field of foundation research, the author traces how China’s evolving policy framework has influenced the development trajectories, legal statuses and modes of operation of both foreign and domestic foundations. The empirical part of the paper focuses on foundation positions, paradigms and power. Based on 12 in-depth interviews conducted in 2014 with foundation representatives and CSO leaders, this research reveals how foreign and domestic foundations position themselves vis-à vis the party-state, market and civil society; how they understand philanthropy; and how they deal with the power imbalance in the relationship between grant maker and grantee. Research findings show that foundations have <b>different</b> <b>value</b> <b>propositions,</b> visions and missions, as well as different theories of change, which determine their philanthropic approaches. Foreign and domestic foundation representatives primarily follow a paradigm of conventional charity, managerial philanthropy, or political philanthropy. Findings from this research raise a number of pertinent questions about the likely impacts of China’s controversial Overseas NGO Law on foreign and domestic foundations and their grantees...|$|E

The internship provided an opportunity to examine this critical process at a wholesaler-distributor firm, in business-to-business supply chain. Distributors cannot expect a premium return on their <b>value</b> <b>proposition</b> of superior service if they cannot persuasively demonstrate it to the customer?s own satisfaction. To address the same, the process is analyzed by focusing on three aspects of <b>value</b> <b>proposition</b> ? <b>value</b> <b>proposition</b> development, demonstration and customization.

40|$|Purpose – This article {{examines}} the notion of value propositions (promises of﻿ reciprocal value between service providers and their customers), value-in-exchange and value-in-use, all within the conceptual context of service-dominant (S-D) logic. Design/methodology/approach – Responding to calls in the recent literature for an academic critique of S-D logic, its key constructs, and its application in marketing situations of varying complexity, the article presents a conceptual analysis of the determinants of value emphasis in value propositions from the S-D perspective. Findings – Four guiding principles are derived from a rigorous analysis of the relevant literatures. Ways are discussed in which firms might achieve greater flexibility in designing their market offerings, and thus manage different customer segments using <b>different</b> <b>value</b> <b>propositions.</b> The general conclusion is {{that the ability to}} communicate a firm’s value propositions strategically and effectively is a new area for the development of competence at the core of competitive advantage. Research implications – The findings pave the way for empirical research into the dynamics of value propositions. Since the main focus of the conceptual framework is on the customer-provider dyad, future studies should broaden coverage to multilateral settings and networked environments. Practical implications – Factors that determine the relative emphasis in value propositions between value-in-exchange and value-in-use are discussed, and the management implications derived from each of the four principles identified. Originality/value – The article elaborates the application of S-D logic in marketing by investigating the determinants of relative emphasis of value propositions.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{impact of}} the increasing building mass in industrial and developing {{parts of the world}} is undeniable. In Europe, the building industry accounts for 38 percent of the total waste production, 40 percent of the CO 2 emissions and 50 percent of all natural resources used within the building sector. (EIB 2015) Such negative {{impact of the}} construction sector is primarily related to the fact that built environment has been optimized for a linear system and one end of life option, demolition. The design of building products with high reuse potential is a necessity to move towards a construction industry that (1) creates building products with an increasing resource productivity; (2) is less dependent on virgin resources and; (3) contributes to the elimination of the concept of waste. As part of the EU Buildings as Material Banks project this paper will discuss the broader framework of a tool that will be able to assess reuse potential of building and its components and enhance their future environmental and economic value propositions. Due to the systemic nature of the tool the paper will showcase several case projects and the assessment of reuse potential indicators, measuring functional, technical and material dependences on three levels of a building’s composition (i. e. building, system, and component). Further to this the relation will be made between indicators of reuse potential with <b>different</b> <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> based on which the framework for measuring environmental and economic impact of different reuse options will be established.

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{the paper}} is to show how {{intelligence}} emanating from customer profitability analysis (CPA) can help improve strategic marketing planning. Insights into the profitability of individual customers, {{as well as the}} distribution of profitability across the customer base, can lead to better decisions in the areas of managing costs and revenues, managing risks and strategic market positioning. Design/methodology/approach – The concept and process of CPA are first explained. The heart of the paper then discusses how the outcomes permit novel analyses related to costs and revenues, risk, and strategic positioning. Finally, the paper explains what is needed to make the shift from retrospective CPA to prospective CPA. Findings – CPA delivers two types of insights: the degree of profitability for each individual customer, and the distribution of profitability among customers within the customer base. Profitability data {{at the level of the}} individual customer support better decision making about service levels, marketing investments and pricing strategies. The profitability distribution curve yields information about the vulnerability of future cash flows from customers. Further, DPA data permit segmentation and targeting on the basis of profitability and the development of <b>different</b> <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> for different profitability segments. Practical implications – Shareholder value is created through cash flows from customers. CPA uncovers where these cash flows are generated. Armed with customer profitability data, marketers can really develop and implement value-driven differentiated customer service strategies. Originality/value – While quite a number of published papers have discussed the technicalities of calculating customer profitability, this paper adds to the literature an overview of how the outcomes of such calculations can help planners make better decisions, to increase the magnitude of cash flows from customers and/or reduce the volatility and vulnerability of such cash flows...|$|E
40|$|While service-dominant logic {{proposes that}} all "Goods are a {{distribution}} mechanism for service provision" (FP 3), {{there is a}} need to understand when and why a firm would utilise direct or indirect (goods) service provision, and the interactions between them, to co-create value with the customer. Three longitudinal case studies in B 2 B equipment-based 'complex service' systems were analysed to gain an understanding of customers' co-creation activities to achieve outcomes. We found the nature of value, degree of contextual variety and the firm's legacy viability to be viability threats. To counter this, the firm uses (a) Direct Service Provision for Scalability and Replicability, (b) Indirect Service Provision for variety absorption and co-creating emotional value and customer experience and (c) designing direct and indirect provision for Scalability and Absorptive Resources of the customer. The co-creation of complex multidimensional value could be delivered through <b>different</b> <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> of the firm. The research proposes a value-centric way of understanding the interactions between direct and indirect service provision in the design of the firm's value proposition and proposes a viable systems approach towards reorganising the firm. The study provides a way for managers to understand the effectiveness (rather than efficiency) of the firm in co-creating value as a major issue in the design of complex socio-technical systems. Goods are often designed within the domain of engineering and product design, often placing human activity as a supporting role to the equipment. Through an SDLogic lens, this study considers the design of both equipment and human activity on an equal footing for value co-creation with the customer, and it yielded interesting results on when direct provisioning (goods) should be redesigned, considering all activities equally.

Research regarding the transition towards product-service systems (PSS) and how the PSS providers' business models are affected exists, {{but there is a}} lack of research regarding how the suppliers to the PSS providers are affected by the transition towards PSS. Therefore, this thesis studies the situation for a supplier/partner to an OEM that has changed their business model to a PSS providing one. As the first step in a development of a new business model aims this thesis to provide guidelines for how to set up value propositions suitable for a supplier/partner in this new environment. When technologically complex products, such as aircraft engines, are provided through PSS offerings it is hard to translate customer needs into quality parameters, which makes it hard to sustain the value to customer over time. Therefore, how to keep the value offering sustainable over time is also investigated in this thesis. The aim of this study was to investigate how a sustainable value proposition can be designed for a product and technology supplier/partner to an OEM that offers PSS solutions. The research has been performed through studying relevant literature and collecting empirical data from a case company through semi-structured interviews and a workshop. The case company in this research is Volvo Aero Corporation (VAC). The empirical findings show that VAC wants to offer product-service bundled solution, which fit the whole spectra of PSS value propositions, to their partners/customers. To be able to deliver these different types of product-service bundled solutions <b>different</b> <b>value</b> <b>propositions</b> that suit the different kinds of PSS offerings are needed. Requirements that must be fulfilled to be able to offer and deliver the different types of value propositions exist in terms of securing sufficient information access, aligning the incentives of all actors involved and achieving an internal consensus of what is delivered...|$|E
40|$|The {{establishment}} of business models for digital technology innovations of uncertain market potential {{is often seen}} as challenging because of the difficulties in conceptualizing the value of such ventures. There is, however, limited empirical material on how digital entrepreneurs and innovators assess the emerging value of a novel digital technology in practice {{in the early stages}} of its development. This thesis, therefore, seeks to investigate how the value of digital innovations with inherent uncertainties about the lack of clearly determined use and addressable markets is justified and how a <b>value</b> <b>proposition</b> is articulated in an emergent way during the design and development process of such innovations, and the implications this has for dealing with the challenges of establishing a business model in such a setting. In particular, I aim to answer: (a) how do the actors involved in the development of digital innovations justify the value of their innovation, (b) how is the <b>value</b> <b>proposition</b> of digital technology innovation with indeterminate use and addressable market arrived at in the development of such innovations, and (c) how does an emergent <b>value</b> <b>proposition</b> contribute to more generally on the theorization and development of business models when there is lack of clear idea of the use and an addressable market. This doctoral research explores these issues through an in-depth study of two ‘serious games’ development companies that seek to develop digital games for businesses. I argue that through mutual adjustment and reconciliation of <b>different</b> <b>value</b> elements, clarity and stability is brought to the articulation of <b>value</b> <b>proposition,</b> which is crucial to the eventual development and drawing-up of a formal business model. The contributions I make namely are: (a) providing insights into a socioeconomic justification of value for digital innovations (b) conceptualizing how a <b>value</b> <b>proposition</b> is articulated, (c) providing new insights into the relationship between <b>value</b> <b>proposition</b> and business model, and (d) introducing a new theoretical approach to the study of <b>value</b> <b>proposition</b> and business model development drawing from the pragmatics of justification...|$|R
40|$|Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017. Living Labs {{are places}} for open {{innovation}} where co-creation {{is a method}} for addressing real-life issues through the attribution of knowledge from science and society, the latter being a form of transdisciplinary social learning. In a Living Lab the representatives from business, society and academia, as well as citizens, have <b>different</b> <b>value</b> perceptions and <b>propositions,</b> providing heterogeneity across the stakeholder value spectrum. This provides a rich set of ideas and values for co-creation {{which can be used}} for both the operational phase and the integral shaping and creating the design for the physical infrastructure of the Living Lab itself. The use of co-creation workshops are demonstrated for ideation amongst the stakeholders for the HSB Living Lab. This is exemplified {{in the development of the}} social washing room which will be prototyped and tested in a fit-for-purpose multifunctional design space...|$|R
