500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Bahraini writer Abbas Busafwan {{argued that the}} Khawalid {{brothers}} are the king's crew and allegations made against them, including Al Bandar report {{are no more than}} the king's own projects. He argued that the early reforms initiated by the king (known as [...] "the reform project") only aim was [...] "re-concentrating power in his <b>hand,</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the PM, and not {{for the creation of a}} popular partnership and a democratic life". Busafwan added that Khalid bin Ahmed and Ahmed bin Ateyatalla were responsible for the formation and implementation of what he called the [...] "Hamad strategy". He did not conciser the CP a moderate, instead he said the CP was [...] "unable to form a balance with the powerful Al-Khawaled".|$|E
500|$|According to Abu Rahma, {{six minutes}} of his footage {{focused on the}} al-Durrahs. France2 {{broadcast}} 59seconds of that scene and released another few seconds of it. No part of the footage shows the boy dead. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the end, during which Muhammad appears to lift his <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> his face. Enderlin said he had cut this scene {{in accordance with the}} France2 ethical charter, because it showed the boy in his death throes ("agonie"), which he said was [...] "unbearable" [...] ("J'ai coupé l'agonie de l'enfant. C'était insupportable... Cela n'aurait rien apporté de plus). In 2007 he said he had meant to use the word agony, not agonie. If he were editing the footage again, he said in 2005, he would include that scene.|$|E

2500|$|Underarm bowling was {{effective}} while pitch conditions were difficult for batsmen due to being uneven and uncovered. [...] In time, {{especially after the}} opening of Lord's {{and the development of}} groundsmanship, pitches began to improve and batsmen were able to play longer innings than formerly. [...] In the 1780s and 1790s, one of the best batsmen around was Tom Walker, who was also a very useful slow bowler. [...] Walker was another improviser like Lumpy and he began to experiment by bowling with his <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> his body. [...] It is not clear how high he raised his hand {{but it could have been}} waist height. [...] He was accused of [...] "jerking" [...] the ball and so delivering it in an unfair and improper manner. [...] He was suitably censured for his trouble and was forced to return to his normal underarm lobs, but he had sown the seeds of bowling's next revolution.|$|E
