40|$|Abstract: Influence of {{different}} pre-hem paths {{on the flange}} geometry was studied first. Among these paths could be vertical, oblique, horizontal. The result of the simulation shows that the vertical pre-hem path leads to less creep. To avoid the hemming quality defects {{around the corner of}} the outer-sheet, influence of the structure of the pre-processing steel on the hemming force was studied. And finally the design scheme of the table-top <b>hemming</b> <b>machine</b> and the basic operating principle were presented...|$|E

40|$|Permanent magnet (PM) {{and field}} {{excitation}} coil (FEC) in hybrid excitation <b>machine</b> (<b>HEMs)</b> {{act as a}} main flux sources which has numerous attractive features compared to interior permanent magnet synchronous machines (IPMSM) usually employed in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The advantage of both permanent magnet and field excitation coil located on the stator is robust rotor structure alike with switch reluctance machine (SRM). Furthermore, this machine becoming more attractive because of variable flux control capabilities from FEC, which is appropriate to be applied for high-speed motor drive systems. This HEM can be categorized as hybrid excitation flux switching machine (HEFSM). In this paper, a novel 12 Slot- 10 Pole HEFSM in which the FEC is wounded in radial direction on the stator is proposed for traction drives in HEVs. The design target of maximum torque and power are 303 Nm and 123 kW, respectively. Moreover, maximum power density of more than 3. 5 kW/kg is to be achieved, resulting that proposed motor have better power density compared to existing IPMSM. Deterministic design optimization technique based on 2 D-FEA is used to treat design parameters defined in rotor, armature coil slot and FEC slot until the target performances are achieved, under maximum current density condition for both armature coil and FEC. The final results prove that the final design HEFSM is {{able to keep the}} equivalent torque density in existing IPMSM installed on commercial HEV...|$|R
40|$|In hybrid {{excitation}} <b>machines</b> (<b>HEMs),</b> {{there are}} two main flux sources which are permanent magnet (PM) and field excitation coil (FEC). These HEMs have better features when compared with interior permanent magnet synchronous machines (IPMSM) used in conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Since all flux sources including PM, FEC and armature coils are located on stator core, the rotor becomes a single piece structure similar with switch reluctance machine (SRM). The combined flux generated by PM and FEC established more excitation fluxes that are required to produce much higher torque of the motor. In addition, variable DC FEC can control the flux capabilities of the motor, thus the machine can be applied for high-speed motor drive system. In this paper, the initial design of single-phase 8 S- 4 P inner-rotor HEFSM is presented. Initiallycoil arrangement tests are examined to confirm the machine operating principle and position of each armature coil phase. Finally, flux comparison of PM, DC FEC and PM with DC FEC, flux linkage at various FEC current densities, JE, flux distribution and flux line of PM with FEC, cogging torque, induced voltage/ back EMF of PM, DC FEC and PM with DC FEC, combination of FEC and armature coil flux characteristic and torque and power versus FEC current density, JE at various armature coil current densities, JA are also analyzed. As a result, the performance of the initial design motor shows that the maximum torque achieved is 81. 6 % of the target performance, whereas the maximum power achieved 47. 4 kW, 15. 6 % is greater than the target value. Thus, by further design refinement and optimization it is expected that the motor will successfully achieve the target performances...|$|R
40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that bone loss experienced by astronauts in zero gravity conditions may be curtailed by appropriate exercise. According to Wolf's law, bone regenerates when muscles produce stresses by {{pulling on the}} bone during daily activity and/or exercise on Earth. To use this theory to prevent or decrease bone loss, one needs to quantify musculoskeletal loads and relate them to bone density changes. In {{the context of the}} space program, it is desirable to determine musculoskeletal loads during exercise so that one may make similar measurements on Earth and in space. In this manner, load measurements on Earth may be used as reference to generate similar loads during exercise in space. A research project to investigate the effects of high-resistive exercise to decrease bone density loss underzero-gravity conditions is being carried out in Life Sciences Research Laboratories at NASA JSC. The project consists of a bed-rest study whereby subjects remain in horizontal position for seventeen weeks. During the study, a subset of those subjects executes a regime of resistive exercises in the horizontal exercise <b>machine</b> (<b>HEM).</b> The HEM was designed so that subjects remain horizontal while exercising to minimize gravity loading even during exercise. Bone density of each subject is measured throughout the duration of their participation. The objective of the study is to determine if the resistive exercises are effective in diminishing or eliminating bone loss. My participation in this project relates to instrumentation, measurement, and processing of signals from displacement sensors (optical encoders) and load-cells. Measurement of displacements will be used to determine the motion of the body during exercise, and load measurements will be used (along with displacement data) to determine forces and torques exerted on each section of the body during exercise. Further, I have assisted in specifying new sensors {{to be added to the}} HEM and to a new prototype resistive exercise machine called the Interim Resistive Exercise Device (IRED). New load cells and encoders should be mounted in these devices to obtain more complete kineto-dynamic information. This report includes a description of the instrumentation that was built to perform measurements in the HEM and the IRED, along with the software that was developed to collect the measurements. It also includes examples of measurements taken in the HEM. Finally, a plan is laid out that describes how these measurements may be used to determine forces exerted by muscles for each exercise...|$|R
