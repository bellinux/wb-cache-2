40|$|Bulgaria is {{situated}} on the Balkan Peninsula. Its northern frontier is {{the lower part of}} the Danube. The Balkan range, with its zonal situation, is part of a natural climatic frontier, dividing Bulgaria into two parts—north and south. One of the main features of the climate in the Danube Plain (northern Bulgaria) is insufficient precipitation—a tendency toward dryness and frequent droughts. The annual amount of precipitation is 500 – 600 mm. The highest monthly values are measured in June (in some places in May), with 55 – 75 mm. February (in some places, March) is the driest month. Absence of precipitation can occur in any month, but the probability of this happening in May and June is very low. At the same time, monthly precipitation can exceed 100 mm in any month; in the summer it can even exceed 250 – 300 mm. The radiation balance is about 50 Kkal. sm- 2. In this study, Budyko’s <b>dryness</b> <b>ratio</b> (1985) is used to define land moistening...|$|E
40|$|To {{complement}} geographical {{presentation of}} remote sensing vegetation information, the authors apply Budyko’s physical state space diagram to analyze functional climate relations. As an example, the authors use Interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) global weather data {{to provide the}} statistics (1982 – 2006) of climate states in a two-dimensional state space spanned by water demand (net radiation N) versus water/energy limitation (<b>dryness</b> <b>ratio</b> D of net radiation over precipitation). Embedding remote sensing–based Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) data [normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) > 0. 1] shows the following results: (i) A bimodal frequency distribution of unit areas (pixels) is aligned near D ~ 1 but separated meridionally, associated with higher and lower net radiation. (ii) Vegetation states are represented as (N, D, NDVI) triplets that reveal temperate and tropical forests crossing the border (D ~ 1) separating energy- and water-limited climates but unexpectedly show that they also exist in marginal regions (few pixels) of large dryness. (iii) Interannual variability of dryness is lowest where the largest climate mean NDVI values of greenness (forests) occur. The authors conclude that the combined (N, D, NDVI) analysis based on climate means has shown that tropical and temperate forests (NDVI > 0. 6) are (i) not restricted to the energy-limited domain D < 1 (extending into the water-limited surface climate regime) and (ii) associated with low interannual variability of dryness. Thus, measures of interannual variability may be included in Budyko’s classical framework of geobotanic analysis of surface climates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{probabilistic}} {{response of}} depth-integrated soil water to given climatic forcing {{can be described}} readily using an existing supply-demand-storage model. An apparently complex interaction of numerous soil, climate, and plant controls {{can be reduced to}} a relatively simple expression for the equilibrium probability density function of soil water as a function of only two dimensionless parameters. These are the index of <b>dryness</b> (<b>ratio</b> of mean potential evaporation to mean precipitation) and a dimensionless storage capacity (active root zone soil water capacity divided by mean storm depth). The first parameter is mainly controlled by climate, with surface albedo playing a subsidiary role in determining net radiation. The second is a composite of soil (through moisture retention characteristics), vegetation (through rooting characteristics), and climate (mean storm depth). This minimalist analysis captures many essential features of a more general probabilistic analysis, but with a considerable reduction in complexity and consequent elucidation of the critical controls on soil water variability. In particular, it is shown that (1) the dependence of mean soil water on the index of dryness approaches a step function in the limit of large soil water capacity; (2) soil water variance is usually maximized when the index of dryness equals 1, and the width of the peak varies inversely with dimensionless storage capacity; (3) soil water has a uniform probability density function when the index of dryness is 1 and the dimensionless storage capacity is large; and (4) the soil water probability density function is bimodal if and only if the index of dryness is � 1, but this bimodality is pronounced only for artificially small values of the dimensionless storage capacity. 1...|$|E

40|$|Background: Sexuality {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an integral aspect of quality of life. Issues surrounding sexuality have also been acknowledged {{to have a great}} impact on {{the quality of life of}} gynecologic cancer patients. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to describe sexual function and sexual activity among Chinese women after gynecologic cancer and to identify significant predicting factors of women's sexuality outcome changes. Methods: This is a descriptive correlational study that was performed in mainland China. A sexuality scale was used to assess women's sexuality outcomes. Results: A total of 156 Chinese women who had gynecologic cancer were included in this study. Study results revealed that sexual dysfunction was an important concern among these women (62. 2 %). The rate of sexual inactivity (70. 5 %) was relatively high. Reasons for sexual inactivity were related to worry about possibly weakening the potency of treatment (46. 5 %), fear of cancer recurrence (41. 1 %), and lack of sexual interest (31 %). When looking at predictors of negative changes of women's sexuality after cancer, this study found that older age (> 50 years old) was associated with the decrease of sexual desire/interest (odds ratio, 3. 64; confidence interval, 1. 19 - 11. 16). Women who received radiation therapy had more severe vaginal <b>dryness</b> (odds <b>ratio,</b> 2. 27; confidence interval, 1. 10 - 4. 72) and were less sexually active than those who did not have radiation therapy. Conclusion: Chinese women after gynecologic cancer suffered from various sexuality concerns. Implications for Practice: Considering the high rates of sexual dysfunction and sexual inactivity, there is a need to integrate sexuality into routine nursing care. School of Nursin...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} whether dyspareunia {{is associated with}} HIV status in menopausal women and also to assess which factors are associated with dyspareunia {{in a group of}} HIV-positive menopausal women. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 178 HIV-negative and 128 HIV-positive women aged 40 - 60 years. The Short Personal Experiences Questionnaire (SPEQ) was used to collect data. Sociodemographic, clinical, behavioural and reproductive factors were evaluated, as well as factors related to the HIV infection. Dyspareunia was defined as pain during intercourse. A bivariate analysis and Poisson multiple regression analysis were performed. Results: Overall, 41. 4 % of the HIV-positive women reported dyspareunia compared with 34. 8 % of the HIVnegative women (p= 0. 242). In the HIV-positive women, bivariate analysis revealed an association between dyspareunia and having a steady partner (p= 0. 047); the woman's partner having undergone HIV testing (p= 0. 020); vaginal dryness (p< 0. 001); muscle/joint pain (p= 0. 021); physical/emotional violence (p= 0. 049); urinary incontinence (p= 0. 004); and the use of lamivudine/zidovudine (p= 0. 048). The Poisson multiple regression analysis found an association between dyspareunia and vaginal <b>dryness</b> (prevalence <b>ratio</b> (PR) = 1. 96, 95 % CI 1. 10 to 3. 50, p= 0. 023) and urinary incontinence (PR= 1. 86, 95 % CI 1. 06 to 3. 27, p= 0. 031). Conclusions: Dyspareunia was common in this group of HIV-positive women and was associated principally with vaginal dryness and urinary incontinence. The importance of treating dyspareunia within the context of sexual health in this group of women should be emphasised and appropriate management of this issue may reduce the likelihood of lesions on the vaginal wall, which may act as a portal of entry for other infections...|$|R

Previous studies have shown conflicting findings regarding the association between dysphagia and its potential risk factors, including age, malnutrition, oral conditions, lifestyle and medical history. Herein, we assessed the prevalence and association of dysphagia with potential risk factors in 50 - to 79 -year-old adults dwelling in a community in Japan. Patients and methods: In this study, there were 532 participants (185 males and 347 females). Participants who responded positively to the question “Do you sometimes choke on drinks/food such as tea and soup?” or those who presented with abnormal repetitive saliva swallowing test findings were diagnosed with dysphagia. The data collected from these participants included the following: number of teeth, occurrence of oral dryness, age, body mass index, serum albumin concentration, smoking, drinking and exercise habits, presence of diseases, such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and questions from the Mini–Mental State Examination. Results: Dysphagia was observed in 33 males (17. 8 %) and 76 females (21. 9 %). To explore the effect of the potential risk factors on the prevalence of dysphagia, a model was built by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Using the forced entry method, oral <b>dryness</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> [OR] = 3. 683 and P= 0. 003 in males; OR = 1. 797 and P= 0. 032 in females) and the number of teeth (OR = 0. 946 and P= 0. 038 in males) were found to be significantly related to dysphagia. Conclusion: This cross-sectional study demonstrated associations between oral conditions and dysphagia. Factors such as oral dryness and number of teeth may contribute to dysphagia more so than aging, lifestyle and comorbidity in community-dwelling adults over the age of 50.

40|$|A {{community-based}} {{survey was}} conducted during 1995 – 1997 of factors related to menopausal and other symptoms in a multi-racial/ethnic sample of 16, 065 women aged 40 – 55 years. Each of seven sites comprising the Study of Women’s Health across the Nation (SWAN) surveyed one of four minority populations and a Caucasian population. The largest adjusted prevalence odds ratios for all symptoms, particularly hot flashes or night sweats (odds ratios = 2. 06 – 4. 32), were for women who were peri- or postmenopausal. Most symptoms were reported least frequently by Japanese and Chinese (odds ratios = 0. 47 – 0. 67 compared with Caucasian) women. African-American women reported vasomotor symptoms and vaginal <b>dryness</b> more (odds <b>ratios</b> = 1. 17 – 1. 63) but urine leakage and difficulty sleeping less (odds ratios = 0. 64 – 0. 72) than Caucasians. Hispanic women reported urine leakage, vaginal dryness, heart pounding, and forgetfulness more (odds ratios = 1. 22 – 1. 85). Hot flashes or night sweats, urine leakage, and stiffness or soreness were associated with a high body mass index (odds ratios = 1. 15 – 2. 18 for women with a body mass index ≥ 27 vs. 19 – 26. 9 kg/m 2). Most symptoms were reported most frequently among women who had difficulty paying for basics (odds ratios = 1. 15 – 2. 05), who smoked (odds ratios = 1. 21 – 1. 78), and who rated themselves less physically active than other women their age (odds ratios = 1. 24 – 2. 33). These results suggest that lifestyle, menstrual status, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status affect symptoms in this age group. Am J Epidemiol 2000; 152 : 463 – 73...|$|R
