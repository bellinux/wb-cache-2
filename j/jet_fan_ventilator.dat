40|$|AbstractJet {{fans are}} {{increasingly}} preferred over traditional ducted systems {{as a means}} of ventilating pollutants from large spaces such as car parking buildings. Outside of tunnel applications <b>jet</b> <b>fans</b> are considered to have limitations as means of smoke control. This is because their effectiveness is limited without side walls and they de-stratify the smoke layer. <b>Jet</b> <b>fans</b> can however, aid post-event in smoke clearance {{under the control of the}} attending fire brigade. The prudent fire mode strategy in those jurisdictions where <b>jet</b> <b>fans</b> are not used for smoke control is for the ventilation system to shut down on a fire alarm signal. The problem lies in the <b>jet</b> <b>fans</b> receiving that signal. A fire has three basic signatures; heat, smoke, and light. Large car parking buildings may be sprinkler-protected. Sprinklers operate on the heat signature. A <b>jet</b> <b>fan</b> is assumed to disrupt this signature by forcing the plume of heat downstream and diluting that plume with cool air. This may delay sprinkler activation. In terms of the smoke signature, the presence of pollutants such as carbon monoxide that could be detected by a specialised detector, are the same signals that would cause a <b>jet</b> <b>fan</b> to increase its flow in normal mode. The response to a smoke signature is contradictory between the desired normal-mode reaction to speed up and the fire-mode reaction to shut down. This leaves light. Fires are very rich across the non-visible light spectra and flame detectors are an effective way to provide a fire signal independent of the normal-mode operation of the <b>jet</b> <b>fans.</b> However, the cost-benefit of installing flame detectors in addition to sprinklers is questionable. A series of detailed computational analyses are therefore undertaken to quantify the impact of the <b>jet</b> <b>fans</b> on delaying sprinkler activation on a typical car park sprinkler arrangement. This article assumes the perspective of a jurisdiction where the fire mode strategy is for the fans to shut down. However, the sprinkler delay will also be of interest where the fire mode strategy is to continue operating. Once sprinkler activation had occurred a fire signal is assumed to have been generated to shut down the <b>jet</b> <b>fans.</b> Separate evaluations can then be made as to whether the delay was acceptable or not, dependent upon to the specific building geometry. The results indicate that for a fast-growing design fire, sprinkler activation occurred at ∼ 180 s with the <b>jet</b> <b>fans</b> off and at ∼ 210 s with them on: an increase of ⩽ 30 s. A separate analysis was undertaken for the case-specific egress safety margin. Comparing the two, it was concluded, that the impact of <b>jet</b> <b>fans</b> upon sprinkler activation was not significant. It was further established that the smoke disturbance due to the <b>jet</b> <b>fan</b> flow did not adversely affect the visibility for those escaping...|$|R
40|$|For road tunnels {{with and}} without smoke extraction, the control of {{longitudinal}} airflow is essential in order to limit smoke propagation in case of fire. Various concepts for the handling of longitudinal airflow have been investigated. These include <b>jet</b> <b>fans,</b> the use of (semi-) transverse ventilation, directed point air injection (Saccardo-nozzles), local air extraction, air curtains and mechanical curtains. At present, the application of <b>jet</b> <b>fans</b> is the standard solution, but not necessarily the optimum for all applications. <b>Jet</b> <b>fan</b> installation in the traffic envelope often leads to problems with corrosion and accessibility for maintenance and repair. <b>Jet</b> <b>fans</b> require extra space under the ceiling or in niches.

The capabilities of the ventilation systems in the two road tunnels at Dartford (London, UK) are analysed using a multi-scale modelling approach. Both tunnels have complex semi-transverse ventilation systems with <b>jet</b> <b>fans</b> to control longitudinal flow. The construction and ventilation systems in the tunnels are described and the current emergency ventilation strategies are presented. The analysis includes a coupling of a 1 D network model with 3 D components, representing the operational <b>jet</b> <b>fans,</b> built using computational fluid dynamics. The <b>jet</b> <b>fans</b> were experimentally characterized on-site and the findings were compared to the model predictions. The predicted ventilation flows {{for each of the}} emergency ventilation strategies are presented and discussed. In cold-flow conditions, ventilation velocities significantly above 3 m/s can be generated throughout the tunnels. However, it is observed that 1 / 3 of the flow generated in the East tunnel is diverted from the tunnel up the extract shafts. The model was used to simulate various reduced fan combinations and thus the level of redundancy in each of the systems has been estimated. It is found that an acceptable level of ventilation may be produced in the West tunnel, even if several pairs of <b>jet</b> <b>fans</b> are disabled. In the East tunnel there is less redundancy, but an acceptable level of ventilation control can be maintained with one or two <b>jet</b> <b>fans</b> disabled...|$|R

In deep advance mining, there would be no workers at the face to advance ventilation tubing or curtain manually. Traditional methods also provide no means for maintaining face ventilation after the miner backs away from the face. U. S. Bureau of Mines research is studying means to provide effective ventilation at cut depths beyond the current limit of 4 D ft. Several innovative ventilation schemes are currently being considered. One such method is the use of a <b>jet</b> <b>fan</b> to ventilate a deep cut. A <b>jet</b> <b>fan</b> is simply a freestanding fan using little or no ducting to direct the ventilation flow. <b>Jet</b> <b>fan</b> testing in a 90 -ft entry revealed that higher exit velocities and greater penetration depth occurred when various configurations were used to confine and direct the air flow.

An analysis {{is made in}} relation to important parameters including <b>jet</b> <b>fan</b> number, <b>jet</b> <b>fan</b> velocity, extract rate and system robustness on fire position. The comparison with ductwork system is also performed to determine the different effect of smoke control between two systems. Fire Dynamic Simulator version 5. 30 is applied to simulate 10 scenarios in a 80 m long, 40 m wide and 3. 2 m height domain witha fire source simulating a car fire with an peak heat release rate of 4 MW. Results show that impulse ventilation system not noly prohibit fire smoke spreading but also maintain a good visibility providing clear access for fighters. However it may cause temperature rise on the downwind zone of fire source with a maximum value between 80 - 100 and fire plume e tilt. Smoke control capacity of impulse ventilation system is sensitive to <b>jet</b> <b>fan</b> numbers. Too high <b>jet</b> <b>fan</b> velocity may cause severe smoke recirculation.

40|$|Background and Aims: Ventilation of road tunnels, using <b>jet</b> <b>fans</b> {{possess a}} number of featuresresulting from pattern of air flow {{distribution}} near solid walls as well as mutual effect of jet fans,dependence of jet momentum (thrust of <b>jet</b> <b>fans)</b> on air flow velocity in the tunnel and otherfactors. Method: In present work, large - scale experimental studies of turbulent jets in stable air mediumor in co - current flow near the solid boundary were performed. Experimental studies wereconducted with two physical models of ventilation system. The hydraulic similarity of physicalmodel and the real system were fulfilled. Measurements were performed with acceptable accuracyand there was shown that distance of jet adherence to the solid surface is specified by relativedistance between jet axis and a wall as well as velocity ratio (ratio of flow velocity to jet velocityof air).

In this paper, the authors have numerically simulated full and reduced-scale tunnel in order to evaluate the possibility to realize a reduced scale of a road tunnel model with a realistic ventilation system consisting of impulsive <b>jet</b> <b>fans.</b> In particular, {{two different types of}} longitudinal ventilation systems were considered, traditional and alternative. The last one was equipped with <b>jet</b> <b>fans</b> that have the inlet/outlet sections inclined at a fixed pitch angle (α= 6 °) toward the tunnel floor.
