5|$|Abbott asked Donen {{to appear}} in the chorus of his next Broadway show Best <b>Foot</b> <b>Forward.</b> He quickly became the show's {{assistant}} stage manager, and Kelly asked him to be his assistant choreographer. Eventually Donen was fired from Best <b>Foot</b> <b>Forward,</b> but in 1942 was the stage manager and assistant choreographer for Abbott's next show Beat the Band. In 1946, Donen briefly returned to Broadway to help choreograph dance numbers for Call Me Mister.|$|E
5|$|Like all Australasian robins, {{the flame}} robin is a perch and pounce hunter, mainly eating insects, and often {{returning}} to a favourite low perch several times to stand erect and motionless, scanning the leaf-litter for more prey. They are typically seen in pairs (during {{the spring and summer}} breeding season) or in loose companies in more open country in winter, when they more commonly feed on the ground. A field study in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales found no significant difference in foraging behaviour between male and female flame robins. Birds have been recorded foraging for insects in furrows in freshly ploughed fields. In Deniliquin, a flame robin was observed holding one <b>foot</b> <b>forward</b> and pattering the ground repeatedly to disturb ground-dwelling insects, and then watching and snapping up any which emerged; this behaviour is otherwise seen in waders.|$|E
5|$|At age 7 Coyne {{enrolled}} in the Gene Kelly Studio of Dance in Johnstown, Pennsylvania and developed a schoolgirl crush on him In her twenties she was cast in Best <b>Foot</b> <b>Forward,</b> where she reconnected with Kelly and first met Donen, later moving to Hollywood with them. She and Donen eloped in 1948, but their marriage became strained. They separated in 1950 and divorced in 1951. During their marriage Donen confided to Coyne his frustration with Kelly while making On the Town, {{only to find that}} she immediately took Kelly's side. Coyne worked as Kelly's personal assistant on several films while married to Donen and continued assisting Kelly until her death. Rumors held that Kelly and Coyne were having an affair both during and after Coyne's marriage to Donen, as well as that Donen was in love with Kelly's first wife Betsy Blair. Blair's autobiography makes no mention of an affair between Kelly and Coyne nor of any romantic relationship with Donen. However, she does state that Donen's marriage to Coyne was unhappy and that Donen was very close to both her and Kelly.|$|E

5|$|Byron's {{attack on}} Skippon's musketeers in the centre also went poorly. Pushing three regiments of <b>foot</b> <b>forward,</b> the force {{suffered}} similarly high casualties {{in an attempt}} to take Round Hill; after the attack stalled, the cavalry had to be called in to force it forward. Despite heavy losses due to the only avenue of advance being a narrow lane lined with Parliamentarian musketeers, this move succeeded in allowing Byron to take Round Hill, forcing the Parliamentarian infantry back to a hedge on the far side. The attack eventually lost momentum, and although Round Hill was taken, Byron was unable to advance any further. On the right flank, William Vavasour attempted to overwhelm the Parliamentary flank with a substantial brigade of foot, which included a small amount of cavalry support. His initial attack was repulsed thanks to the Parliamentarian artillery opening fire, but a subsequent head-on attack forced Skippon's beleaguered force in the centre to send several regiments over to assist, with the fight turning into a bloody melee. Vavasour's force was eventually forced to retire, with the Parliamentarians failing to give ground.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{popularity}} of worship of a more benign form of Kaali, as Daksinakali, is often attributed to Krishnananda Agamavagisha. He was a noted Bengali leader of the 17th century, author of a Tantra encyclopedia called Tantrasara. According to hearsay - Kaali appeared {{to him in a}} dream and told him to popularize her in a particular form that would appear to him the following day. The next morning he observed a young woman making cow dung patties. While placing a patty on a wall, she stood in the alidha pose, with her right <b>foot</b> <b>forward.</b> When she saw Krishnananda watching her, she was embarrassed and put her tongue between her teeth. Krishnananada took his previous worship of Kali out of the cremation grounds and into a more domestic setting. Krishnananda Vagamavagisha was also the guru of the Kaali devotee and poet Ramprasad Sen.|$|E

Broadway director George Abbott caught one of the nights, and offered Allyson one of the lead roles in his production of Best <b>Foot</b> <b>Forward</b> (1941).|$|E
25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved.

I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand.

At the {{critical}} {{moment of the}} battle, when the French Imperial Guard attacked Welligton's weakened centre, Colborne made a decisive intervention. On his own initiative, Colborne brought the 52nd Regiment of <b>Foot</b> <b>forward,</b> took up a flanking position {{in relation to the}} Imperial Guard and then, after firing repeated volleys into their flank, charged at the Guard so driving them back in disorder. As soon as General Sir Frederick Adam saw what Colborne was doing, he sent in extra troops to support him. Colborne drove forward towards La Haye Sainte, while Wellington rode back to main line to order the general advance.|$|E

25|$|High-heeled shoes slant the <b>foot</b> <b>forward</b> {{and down}} while bending the toes up. The more the feet are forced into this position, {{the more it}} may cause the {{gastrocnemius}} muscle (part of the calf muscle) to shorten. This may cause problems when the wearer chooses lower heels or flat-soled shoes. When the foot slants forward, a much greater weight is transferred to the ball of the foot and the toes, increasing the likelihood of damage to the underlying soft tissue that supports the foot. In many shoes, style dictates function, either compressing the toes or forcing them together, possibly resulting in blisters, corns, hammer toes, bunions (hallux valgus), Morton's neuroma, plantar fasciitis and many other medical conditions, {{most of which are}} permanent and require surgery to alleviate the pain.|$|E
25|$|Courtship and {{relationships}} in the Philippines are conservative in nature. The man will have to court the woman and prove his love for her before he can win her heart. Sometimes the courtship period would last for years; this however, is a very old fashioned idea. In the bigger more urbanized cities, this conservative courtship idea is not so emphasized as much. Parents prefer their daughter to be courted in theirhome, so {{they can have a}} chance to know the man. It is during the courtship period that the man would put his best <b>foot</b> <b>forward</b> to create a good impression on the woman and her family. Generally, the man is being measured on his being a gentleman, ability to respect the woman's family, and servitude (the extent of what he was willing to do to prove his love for the woman). Usually, the woman is courted by several men and will have to choose the best from among her suitors. Courtship {{and relationships}} remain the same for rural and urban areas despite the modern western influence.|$|E
500|$|Compared {{to other}} gastropods, Laevistrombus {{canarium}} has an unusual means of locomotion that is common only among the Strombidae. This curious series of maneuvers was originally described by American zoologist George Howard Parker in 1922. The animal initially fixes the posterior {{end of the}} foot by thrusting the point of its sickle-shaped operculum into the substrate. Then it extends its <b>foot</b> <b>forward,</b> lifting the shell and throws it ahead in a motion that {{has been described as}} [...] "leaping".|$|E

[...] Bending the left knee slightly, he draws his right arm well back.

500|$|In 1943 Arthur Freed, the {{successful}} producer of musical films at Metro Goldwyn Mayer, bought the film rights to Best <b>Foot</b> <b>Forward</b> {{and made a}} film version starring Lucille Ball and William Gaxton. Donen moved to Hollywood to audition for the film and signed a one-year contract with MGM. In Best <b>Foot</b> <b>Forward,</b> Donen appeared as a chorus dancer and was made assistant choreographer by Charles Walters. At MGM Donen renewed his friendship with Kelly, who was quickly becoming a popular supporting actor in musicals. When Kelly was loaned to Columbia Pictures for a film with Rita Hayworth, he was offered the chance to choreograph his own dance numbers and asked Donen to assist. Kelly stated, [...] "Stanley needed a job. I needed someone to count for the cameraman, someone who knew the steps and could explain what I {{was going to do}} so the shot was set up correctly." [...] Donen accepted and choreographed three dance sequences with Kelly in 1944's Cover Girl. Donen {{came up with the idea}} for the [...] "Alter Ego" [...] dance sequence where Kelly's reflection jumps out of a shop window and dances with him. Director Charles Vidor insisted that the idea would never work, so Donen and Kelly directed the scene themselves and Donen spent over a year editing it. The film made Kelly a movie star and is considered by many film critics to be an important and innovative musical. Donen signed a one-year contract with Columbia and choreographed several films there, but returned to MGM the following year when Kelly wanted assistance on his next film.|$|E
