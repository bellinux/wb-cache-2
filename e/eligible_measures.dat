40|$|Carbon and {{financial}} accounting of {{projects in the}} Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry sector is a topic of hot debate. Large uncertainty remains concerning the carbon dynamics, the way they should be accounted and the cost efficiency of the projects. Part of the uncertainty can be alleviated by standardisation and transparency of reporting methods. For this reason we further developed CO 2 FIX, a forest ecosystem carbon model, with modules for carbon {{and financial}} accounting. The model is applied to four cases: 1) Joint implementation afforestation project in Romania, 2) Forest management project in Central Europe, 3) Reduced impact logging possibly under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in the future, and 4) Afforestation with native species under the Clean Development Mechanism. The results show the wide applicability of CO 2 FIX, from degrading grasslands as baseline cases to multiple cohort forest ecosystems. Also {{the results show that}} Forest Management in the European case can generate considerable amounts of carbon emission reductions. Further, the results show that although reduced impact logging is not yet an allowed option under the Clean Development Mechanism, it shows promising results in that it is 1) very cost effective, 2) seems to be able to generate intermediate amounts of credits and 3) seems to us as a project type that is not prone to leakage issues.

Methods: data were collected in clinics treating sexually transmissible infections in three cities in the southern United States. Males 15 – 23 years of age (n = 697) who identified as African-American and reported recent (past 2 months) condom use were <b>eligible.</b> <b>Measures</b> of alcohol and drug use, as well as condom use behaviours were assessed by audio-computer assisted self-interview. Eighteen CUEP were included in this assessment. Results: sixteen bivariate correlations were obtained. The magnitude of the coefficients was small, ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 13. Only three were significant. These were positive associations between the frequency of being drunk and the frequency of unprotected vaginal sex, as well as the frequency of the 18 -item measure of CUEP. A significant correlation was also found between the frequency of being high during sex and the frequency of unprotected vaginal sex. Adjustments for age did not change the findings. Conclusions: interventions designed to promote safer sex behaviours among young Black males attending sexually transmissible infection clinics are no more likely to benefit patients through the inclusion of messages and training attempting to dissuade the use of alcohol and drugs before or during se...|$|E
40|$|Introduction It {{is unclear}} whether {{inpatient}} heart failure (HF) performance measures reduce post-discharge adverse events. This exploratory study examined the association between systematic adherence {{to a set of}} performance measures and outcomes. Measures included all four Joint Commission (JC) HF core measures and AHA recommended beta blockade prescription on discharge. Methods A retrospective review of a 3 -hospital system was performed for all patients discharged with a primary diagnosis of HF in 2008 - 2009. Patients were included if they met eligibility criteria for one or more measures (n= 1270). ‘Perfect care’ was defined as compliance with all <b>eligible</b> <b>measures.</b> Subsequent all-cause 30 -day readmission and 1 -year mortality was determined via electronic records and social security national database. Results ‘Perfect care’ significantly reduced 30 -day readmissions (19. 2 % vs. 24. 9 %, p=. 045; OR=. 72, 95 % CI 0. 52 - 0. 99). ‘Perfect care’ did not influence 1 -year mortality. Conclusions Adherence to this set of composite performance measures positively influenced short-term patient outcomes. Benefit of adherence was found despite the longer LOS and higher severity of illness on index admission for patients receiving ‘perfect care’. The data support the clinical value of a systematic approach towards HF care on patient care quality. ‘Perfect care’ did not influence long term outcomes, which may be because inpatient processes do not extend to long term outpatient medical management...|$|E

We found that market behaviour responds to the unique design and context in which TWC schemes are implemented. Contrary to expectations, limited trading is observed so the 'to-trade-or-not-to-trade' dilemma is further analysed. A real TWC market has emerged only in Italy, where obliged parties (i. e. energy distributors) show preference towards 'to-trade'. In Great Britain and France, an autarky compliance approach is identified, with obliged parties (i. e. energy suppliers) showing preference towards 'not-to-trade' driven by, among many factors, commercial benefits of non-trading (e. g. increased competitiveness). At the same time, results show clearer indications of cost-effectiveness for Great Britain than for Italy. In general, high energy-saving effectiveness is observed, but low ambitious saving targets and pitfalls in the regulatory framework {{need to be considered}} to further develop TWC markets. Initial market and institutional conditions strongly suggest that trading might not be an immediate outcome. Ambitious energy targets can trigger a more dynamic usage of all flexibilities by eligible parties and thus active behaviour in TWC markets...|$|E

The need to develop the UK supply for domestic heat pumps (HPs) and to evaluate the empirical performance of HP systems in the field {{has led to the}} establishment of two major UK field trials of HPs (the first one took place between 2008 and 2012). These data were generated from the second field trial, established by the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) in conjunction with the Renewable Heat Premium Payment (RHPP) grant scheme, which ran from 2011 - 2014 (note that the data included here cover the period October 2013 -March 2015). The RHPP policy provided subsidies for private householders, Registered Social Landlords and communities to install renewable heat measures in residential properties. <b>Eligible</b> <b>measures</b> included air and ground-source heat pumps, biomass boilers and solar thermal. Around 18, 000 heat pumps were installed via this scheme. The DECC funded a detailed monitoring campaign, which covered 700 heat pumps (around 4 % of the total).

This study examines whether the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture for hospital management (HSOPS_M) has the same psychometric properties as the HSOPS for hospital employees does. Methods In 2008, a questionnaire survey including the HSOPS_M was conducted with 1, 224 medical directors from German hospitals. When assessing the psychometric properties, we performed a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Additionally, we proved construct validity and internal consistency. Results A total of 551 medical directors returned the questionnaire. The results of the CFA suggested a satisfactory global data fit. The indices of local fit indicated a good, but not satisfactory convergent validity. Analyses of construct validity indicated that not all safety culture dimensions were readily distinguishable. However, Cronbach's alpha indicated that the dimensions had an acceptable level of reliability. Conclusion The analyses of the psychometric properties of the HSOPS_M resulted in reasonably good levels of property values. Although the set of dimensions within the HSOPS_M needs further scale refinement, the questionnaire covers a broad range of sub-dimensions and supplies important information on safety culture. The HSOPS_M, therefore, is <b>eligible</b> to <b>measure</b> safety culture from the hospital management's points of view and could be used in nationwide hospital surveys to make inter-organisational comparisons. </p...|$|R

Quality measurement is essential to monitor effectiveness and to guide improvements in healthcare. Methods Ten databases, including Medline, were searched electronically to identify measures assessing the quality of breast cancer care in women (diagnosis, treatment, followup, documentation of care). <b>Eligible</b> studies <b>measured</b> adherence to standards of breast cancer care in women diagnosed with, or in treatment for, any histological type of adenocarcinoma of the breast. Reference lists of studies, review articles, web sites, and files of experts were searched manually. Evidence appraisal entailed dual independent assessments of data (e. g., indicators used in quality measurement). The extent of each quality indicator's scientific validation as a measure was assessed. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) was asked to contribute quality measures under development. Results Sixty relevant reports identified 58 studies with 143 indicators assessing adherence to quality breast cancer care. A paucity of validated indicators (n = 12), most of which assessed quality of life, only permitted a qualitative data synthesis. Most quality indicators evaluated processes of care.

Previous trials reported inconsistent findings regarding the efficacy and safety {{of chemotherapy}} on overall survival (OS) and treatment-related mortality. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of chemotherapy plus BSC versus BSC alone on survival of patients with NSCLC. Methodology and Principal Findings: We systematically searched PubMed, EmBase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant literature. All eligible studies included patients with NSCLC who had received chemotherapy and BSC or BSC alone. All <b>eligible</b> studies <b>measured</b> at least 1 of the following outcomes: OS or treatment-related mortality. Overall, patients that received chemotherapy plus BSC had significant longer OS than those that received BSC alone (HR, 0. 76; 95 %CI, 0. 69 – 0. 84; P, 0. 001). Additionally, chemotherapy plus BSC as compared to BSC alone resulted in a 28 % RR reduction (95 %CI: 12 – 40; P = 0. 001) in 6 -month mortality, 11 % RR reduction (95 %CI: 8 – 15; P, 0. 001) in 12 -month mortality, and 5 % RR reduction (95 %CI: 1 – 8; P = 0. 02) in 2 -year mortality.

METHODS: The principles of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group were employed. Randomized controlled trials with a parallel design, comparing single versus double IUI in subfertile couples, would be eligible. The main outcome measures included live birth rate and pregnancy rate per couple (and per cycle). RESULTS: Three studies involving 386 women were included. The results of pregnancy rate per couple, of two studies showed no significant effect of using double insemination [Peto odds ratio (OR) 1. 45; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 78 - 2. 70]. The results of pregnancy rate per cycle of the included studies favoured double insemination, however this is not an <b>eligible</b> outcome <b>measure.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of two trials, double intrauterine insemination showed no significant benefit over single IUI in the treatment of subfertile couples with partner semen. There are no meaningful data to offer advice {{on the basis of this}} review. A randomized controlled trial of single versus double IUI is justifie...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Mental health {{problems}} are common and {{are associated with}} increased disability and health care costs. Problem-Solving Treatment (PST) delivered to these patients by nurses in primary care might be efficient. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PST by mental health nurses compared with usual care (UC) by the general practitioner for primary care patients with mental {{health problems}}. Methods An economic evaluation from a societal perspective was performed alongside a randomized clinical trial. Patients with a positive General Health Questionnaire score (score ≥ 4) and who visited their general practitioner at least three times during the past 6 months were <b>eligible.</b> Outcome <b>measures</b> were improvement on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and QALYs based on the EQ- 5 D. Resource use was measured using a validated questionnaire. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation techniques. Bootstrapping was used to analyze costs and cost-effectiveness of PST compared with UC. Results There were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes at 9 months. Mean total costs were € 4795 in the PST group and € 6857 in the UC group. Costs were not statistically significantly different between the two groups (95 % CI - 4698; 359). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that PST was cost-effective in comparison with UC. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings. Conclusions PST delivered by nurses seems cost-effective in comparison with UC. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, since the difference in total costs was mainly caused by 3 outliers with extremely high indirect costs in the UC group.

40|$|Background Elevated {{ferritin}} {{levels have}} been associated with single cardiovascular risk factors but the relationship to the presence of metabolic syndrome is inconclusive. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis of published observational studies was to estimate the association between serum ferritin levels and metabolic syndrome in adults. Methods The Pubmed, SCOPUS and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for epidemiological studies that assessed the association between ferritin levels and metabolic syndrome and were published before September 2013. There were no language restrictions. Two investigators independently selected <b>eligible</b> studies. <b>Measures</b> of association were pooled by using an inverse-variance weighted random-effects model. The heterogeneity among studies was examined using the I 2 index. Publication bias was evaluated using the funnel plot. Results Twelve cross-sectional, one case–control and two prospective studies met our inclusion criteria including data from a total of 56, 053 participants. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for the metabolic syndrome comparing the highest and lowest category of ferritin levels was 1. 73 (95 % CI: 1. 54, 1. 95; I 2 ?= 75, 4 %). Subgroup analyses indicate that pooled OR was 1. 92 (95 % CI: 1. 61, 2. 30; I 2 ?= 78 %) for studies adjusting for C-reactive protein (CRP), and 1. 52 (95 % CI: 1. 36, 1. 69; I 2 ?=? 41 %) for studies that did not adjust for CRP (P?=? 0. 044). This finding was remarkably robust in the sensitivity analysis. We did not find publication bias. Conclusions The meta-analysis suggests that increased ferritin levels are independently and positively associated with the presence of the metabolic syndrome with an odds ratio higher than 1. 73.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{economics}} of various chemotherapeutic regimens for advanced gastric cancer (AGC), and to select the best cost-effective regimen for the common Chinese patients. METHODS: Data source {{used in this study}} was the Chinese Biomedical Disk Database. Patients were diagnosed as AGC and any regimen was <b>eligible.</b> Outcome <b>measures</b> included median survival time (MST) and percentage of complete and partial response (CR+PR). Economic statistics was per capita direct medical cost (DMC) of a single cycle. TreeAge Pro Healthcare 2007 software was used to carry out cost-effectiveness and incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. Sensitivity analyses were applied by altering willingness-to-pay and annual discount rate, and also re-analyzed by excluding the studies with apparent heterogeneity. RESULTS: Seven retrospective economics studies on 760 patients were included. 5 -fluorouracil-based regimens were universal, and also some new agents were involved, such as docetaxel, paclitaxel, and oxaliplatin. By processing analysis, we could recommend etoposide, leucovorin and 5 -fluorouracil (ELF) regimen as preference, with a DMC/MST ratio of 2543 RBM/ 11. 7 mo and a DMC/CR+PR ratio of 2543 RMB/ 53. 3 %. Uracil-tegafur, etoposide and cisplatin (FEP) or 5 -fluorouracil, adrimycin/epirubin and mitomycin (FAM) regimens could be regarded as optional first-line chemotherapy for AGC in common Chinese patients. With no regard for willingness-to-pay, the docetaxel, cisplatin and 5 -fluorouracil (DCF) regimen could be chosen as either a first- or a second-line chemotherapy, with a DMC/CR+PR ratio of 9979 RMB/ 56. 3 %. CONCLUSION: 5 -fluorouracil regimens are still considered the mainstream for AGC, while new agents such as taxanes are optional. More randomized clinical trials are required before any mandatory recommendation of certain regimens for patients with AGC in China is made...|$|R
