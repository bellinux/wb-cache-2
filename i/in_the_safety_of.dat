5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of convincing {{evidence}} of toxicity of thiomersal when used as a vaccine preservative, the USPHS and AAP determined that thiomersal should be removed from vaccines as a purely precautionary measure. This action {{was based on the}} precautionary principle, which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unnecessary. The CDC and AAP reasoned that despite {{the lack of}} evidence of significant harm in the use of thiomersal in vaccines, the removal of this preservative would increase the public confidence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> vaccines. Although thiomersal was largely removed from routine infant vaccines by summer 2001 in the U.S., some vaccines continue to contain non-trace amounts of thiomersal, mainly in multi-dose vaccines targeted against influenza and tetanus.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely {{populated}} {{communities around the}} bay transformed during the 20th century. Following the devastating 1900 hurricane, donations by the newly created Red Cross, including millions of strawberry plants to Gulf Coast farmers, helped revive area communities. This and the subsequent establishment of a major strawberry farm in the area by Texaco founder Joseph S. Cullinan made Pasadena an important fruit producer for many years afterward. The newly established community of Texas City opened its port and railroad junctions shipping cotton and grain. In fact, because the port had opened just before the 1900 hurricane, {{it was able to}} handle Galveston's diverted shipping traffic until the island's damaged port was repaired. Following another hurricane in 1915, the Texas City Dike was built to protect the Texas City ship channel from sediment movement in future storms, thus helping to build confidence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> the port. One of the most immediate effects of the dike, however, was to increase the salt levels in West Bay, between Galveston and the southwest coastline.|$|E

Torrington burnt six more badly-damaged Dutch ships (Noorderkwartier, Gekroonde Burg, Maagd van Enkhuizen, Elswout, Tholen and the fireship Maagd van Enkhuizen) and one English ship (the third rate 70-gun Anne) to avoid their capture before gaining the refuge of the Thames.

Since 1925, the exportation of helium had also been tightly restricted by Congress, although there is no record that the German Government had ever applied for an export license for helium to use in its airships prior to the Hindenburg's crash and fire.|$|E

Justinian was forced to act when in 704 word reached that he was wanted dead or alive for a handsome reward. Such rumors were confirmed when a band of soldiers arrived at his location. Realizing that his life was in danger, he invited two of the officers (whom he suspected as the assassins) to his house and murdered them.

On 21 March, TEPCO apologized for the delay in reporting the power loss, and for not contacting the media, and promised to improve on this. The NRA decided, that it would speed up the installment of back-up power supply systems, and more durable and reliable systems. A meeting of experts was announced for 29 March 2013 to discuss the TEPCO report on the subject. Serious criticism came from the Japanese government; TEPCO was instructed to install multiple power supplies, and to do more to restore public confidence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> the plant. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a press conference, that TEPCO was ordered to improve its risk management, that TEPCO had not promptly informed the authorities, and that TEPCO's handling of the power failure had greatly damaged public trust in the company.|$|E
25|$|Rana Prasad Rao of Amarkot duly welcomed Humayun {{into his}} home and {{sheltered}} the refugees for several months. Here, in the household of a Hindu Rajput nobleman, Humayun's wife Hamida Bano, daughter of a Sindhi Shia family, {{gave birth to the}} future Emperor Akbar on 15 October 1542. The date of birth is well established because Humayun consulted his astronomer to utilise the astrolabe and check the location of the planets. The infant was the long-awaited heir-apparent to the 34-year-old Humayun and the answer of many prayers. Shortly after the birth, Humayun and his party left Amarkot for Sindh, leaving Hamida and her child in the custody of their Hindu hosts. A couple of years later, at Humayun's behest, Hamida would leave her infant son <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>safety</b> <b>of</b> remote Amarkot and join her husband as he fled into Persia, where her Shia and Persian background would bring influence. The infant Akbar was to live for more than five years, all alone, in the care of a Hindu, Rajput foster-family. This was to have a profound, indelible influence on his views and personality, and a momentous effect on the subsequent history of India. In particular, Akbar developed a strong affinity for the Rajputs, going {{out of his way to}} forge alliances (including marriage alliances) with them, and they would form the bedrock of support for his dynasty for two centuries.|$|E
