5|$|After {{some initial}} resistance, the Duke yields to Süß's {{request for the}} repeal of the law prohibiting Jews from living in Württemberg; a horde of dirty, disreputable Jews are then shown moving into the city.

The aged Rabbi Loew (Werner Krauss) criticizes Süß for his excessively opulent lifestyle as the Duke's finance minister and warns that it could be his downfall, warning that, “The Lord punishes Jews who forget who they are!” but Süß pays him no heed.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{theory of}} <b>enriched</b> {{accessible}} categories over a suitable base category V is developed. It is proved that these <b>enriched</b> accessible categories {{coincide with the}} categories of flat functors, {{but also with the}} categories of models of <b>enriched</b> sketches. A particular attention isdevoted to <b>enriched</b> locally presentable categoriesand <b>enriched</b> functors...|$|R
50|$|Simplicially <b>enriched</b> {{categories}}, or simplicial categories, are categories <b>enriched</b> over simplicial sets. However, {{when we look}} at them as a {{model for}} (infinity,1)-categories, then many categorical notions (e.g., limits) do not agree with the corresponding notions in the sense of <b>enriched</b> categories. The same for other <b>enriched</b> models like topologically <b>enriched</b> categories.|$|R
5|$|As {{attachment}} theory {{offers a}} broad, far-reaching {{view of human}} functioning, it can <b>enrich</b> a therapist's understanding of patients and the therapeutic relationship rather than dictate a particular form of treatment. Some forms of psychoanalysis-based therapy for adults—within relational psychoanalysis and other approaches—also incorporate attachment theory and patterns. In {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, key concepts of attachment were incorporated into existing models of behavioural couple therapy, multidimensional family therapy and couple and family therapy. Specifically attachment-centred interventions have been developed, such as attachment-based family therapy and emotionally focused therapy.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{are often}} {{important}} to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the moas were important browsers, {{as are the}} kereru and kokako today. Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved {{to protect them from}} the extinct moa. Nesting seabirds may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano, which may <b>enrich</b> the local soil and the surrounding seas.|$|E
5|$|Faced with a poor {{economy in}} 1974, Filipino President, Ferdinand Marcos {{implemented}} a labour code which began his country's export of labour {{in the form}} of overseas workers. The Philippine government encouraged this labour export to reduce the unemployment rate and <b>enrich</b> its treasury with the workers' remittances. The economy of the Philippines became increasingly dependent on labour export; in 1978 labour-export recruiting agencies were privatised, and became a cornerstone of the economy.|$|E

After 6 weeks, the mice were injected intramuscularly with Klebsiella pneumoniae.

The study was repeated by comparing the survival of mice fed a fish-oil <b>enriched</b> diet to those given a corn-oil <b>enriched</b> diet. After 120 h the survival curve for mice fed the fish-oil <b>enriched</b> diet was significantly better compared to the survival curve for mice given the corn-oil <b>enriched</b> diet (p = 0. 01).

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the largely alignment-oriented statistically led methods of Green archaeoastronomy, Brown archaeoastronomy {{has been identified as}} being closer to the history of astronomy or to cultural history, insofar as it draws on historical and ethnographic records to <b>enrich</b> its understanding of early astronomies and their relations to calendars and ritual. The many records of native customs and beliefs made by the Spanish chroniclers means that Brown archaeoastronomy is most often associated with studies of astronomy in the Americas.|$|E

It was estimated that the S-50 plant had sped up production of enriched uranium used in the Little Boy bomb employed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by a week.|$|E

40|$|Populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC 366, grown anaerobically under {{conditions}} {{that lead to}} enrichment of membranes with specific sterols and fatty-acyl residues, were subjected to freeze-thaw cycles and cold-shock stress. One freeze-thaw cycle caused considerable loss in viability, the loss being greater with organisms <b>enriched</b> in campesterol or cholesterol rather than ergosterol or stigmasterol. Retention of viability was greater in populations <b>enriched</b> in linoleyl rather than oleyl residues. Organisms <b>enriched</b> in ergosterol and either oleyl or cetoleyl residues were equally susceptible to death following freeze-thaw cycles, but less so than organisms <b>enriched</b> in palmitoleyl residues.

Over time, the university continued to provide classes and educational activities in topics popular with the local community, including arts, crafts, agricultural topics, animal husbandry, and local history. In 1958, for example, two AE-sponsored travelling expositions on Australian artists and Aboriginal culture were viewed by an estimated 12,000 people in the New England area.

5|$|These {{injected}} elements ultimately <b>enrich</b> {{the molecular}} clouds {{that are the}} sites of star formation. Thus, each stellar generation has a slightly different composition, going from an almost pure mixture of hydrogen and helium to a more metal-rich composition. Supernovae are the dominant mechanism for distributing these heavier elements, which are formed in a star during its period of nuclear fusion. The different abundances of elements in the material that forms a star have important influences on the star's life, and may decisively influence the possibility of having planets orbiting it.|$|E
