5|$|Fleming {{developed}} the James Bond character more in Goldfinger {{than in the}} previous six novels, presenting him as a more complex individual, whilst also bringing out a theme of Bond as Saint George. The Saint George theme <b>is</b> <b>echoed</b> {{by the fact that it}} is a British agent sorting out an American problem.|$|E
5|$|The first {{movement}} is in cut common (2/2) time. It {{starts with the}} cello, alone, playing eight quarter notes on the same B-flat. It is not until the third measure of the movement that the violins and viola enter. The cello's eight throbbing notes act as more than an introduction. They reappear at critical junctures throughout the movement, including {{at the beginning of}} the development and recapitulation sections, illustrating that they are part of the movement's primary thematic material. The melody that follows the eight cello notes <b>is</b> <b>echoed</b> in Beethoven's String Quartet No. 1 (Op. 18, No. 1).|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the battle shocked the Croatian {{commander}} and later resulted in speculation about its cause. Stipetić blamed the 108th Infantry Brigade for {{the collapse of the}} Bosanski Brod bridgehead and the failure of the defence. He claimed the brigade had been pulled back from the battlefield by civilian authorities in Slavonski Brod and thought the {{outcome of the}} battle was predetermined by the Graz agreement of the Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat leaders, Radovan Karadžić and Mate Boban. General Karl Gorinšek, commander in charge of defending neighboring Slavonia during Posavina's fall, said that the Croatian administration showed no interest in defending Posavina and that he continuously got orders to not take any initiative in defending the territory. Stipetić's view regarding the Graz agreement <b>is</b> <b>echoed</b> by British historian Marko Attila Hoare, who claims that the area conceded by the Croats during Operation Corridor 92 was traded for western Herzegovina. On the other hand, Croatian-American historian James J. Sadkovich, among others, described that view as a conspiracy theory. While some sources have proposed that the area was traded for the JNA-held Prevlaka Peninsula near Dubrovnik, a Central Intelligence Agency analysis concluded that there is no direct evidence of such arrangements.|$|E

25|$|Another {{distinguishing}} form of African {{music is}} its call-and-response nature: one voice or instrument plays a short melodic phrase, and that phrase <b>is</b> <b>echoed</b> by another voice or instrument. The call-and-response nature {{extends to the}} rhythm, where one drum will play a rhythmic pattern, echoed by another drum playing the same pattern.|$|E
25|$|Mendelsohn designs a {{hat factory}} in Luckenwalde. It shows {{influences}} of the Dutch expressionist De Klerk, setting dramatic tall pitched industrial forms against horizontal administrative elements. This approach <b>is</b> <b>echoed</b> in his Leningrad textile mill of 1925 and anticipates the banding in his department stores in Breslau, Stuttgart, Chemnitz and Berlin from 1927 and 1931.|$|E

Both side profiles feature five double-hung sash windows with lancet arched transoms with colored glass Stars of David in the tracery surrounded by opaque glass.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{his film}} and {{television}} programs, Pee-wee Herman's background has remained relatively ambiguous. During interviews, he has been portrayed as though he is a real life stand-up comedian who expanded his career by playing himself in his films and TV series. This <b>is</b> <b>echoed</b> {{by the fact that}} a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was awarded to Pee-wee Herman rather than Paul Reubens.|$|E
25|$|Irfan Habib and Mohibbul Hasan {{argue that}} these early British authors had a strong vested {{interest}} in presenting Tipu Sultan as a tyrant from whom the British had liberated Mysore. This assessment <b>is</b> <b>echoed</b> by Brittlebank in her recent work where she writes that Wilks and Kirkpatrick must be used with particular care as both authors had taken part in the wars against Tipu Sultan and were closely connected to the administrations of Lord Cornwallis and Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley.|$|E

25|$|Elements of the {{painting}} stress the vertical {{that is associated with}} Gothic architecture. The three-pronged pitchfork <b>is</b> <b>echoed</b> in the stitching of the man's overalls, the Gothic window of the house, and the structure of the man's face. However, Wood did not add figures to his sketch until he returned to his studio in Cedar Rapids. He would not return to Eldon again before his death in 1942, although he did request a photograph of the home to complete his painting.|$|E
25|$|The {{imagery of}} the verse <b>is</b> <b>echoed</b> in the screen design, which {{features}} an outline of Mount Fuji, a soaring hawk and an eggplant. These three elements belong to the hatsuyume (初夢) or 'First Dream' tradition, a belief that, when seen in order in the first dream of the year, these items augur good fortune. This was a popular notion by the mid-seventeenth century, and is a common motif in prints and paintings from the period. These images continue to appear on new year greeting cards (nengajō - 年賀状) to this day.|$|E
25|$|A simple cornice {{marks the}} {{roofline}} around the entire building, with modillions {{in the end}} gables. On the front side, the central bay projects to form {{the base of the}} steeple. All three bays on the front elevation have a red paneled double wooden door surrounded by fluted pilasters with a projecting cornice on top. Above each one on the second story is a window topped with semicircular fanlight. At the attic is a decorative circular light. This <b>is</b> <b>echoed</b> by a round-arched louvered vent {{on each side of the}} steeple.|$|E

25|$|Weber (1948, p.214) {{gives the}} analogy that “the fully {{developed}} bureaucratic mechanism compares with other organizations exactly {{as does the}} machine compare with the non-mechanical modes of production. Precision, speed, unambiguity, … strict subordination, reduction of friction and of material and personal costs- these are raised to the optimum point in the strictly bureaucratic administration.” Bureaucratic structures have {{a certain degree of}} standardization. They are better suited for more complex or larger scale organizations, usually adopting a tall structure. The tension between bureaucratic structures and non-bureaucratic <b>is</b> <b>echoed</b> in Burns and Stalker's distinction between mechanistic and organic structures.|$|E
25|$|In AD 51, {{his brother}} Nero assumed the toga virilis despite not yet being 14. The Senate also decided then that Nero should hold the consulship during his twentieth year (AD 56) and, as consul-elect, {{that he should}} enjoy imperium proconsulare ("proconsular authority") {{beyond the limits of}} Rome with the title of princeps iuventutis ("prince of the youth of Rome"). The {{progress}} of Nero seems to have followed in the footsteps of Gaius and Lucius Caesar. To mark the occasion, a donative was given to the soldiery of Rome, and presents to the people. His step-brother's status, along with that of Agrippina, <b>is</b> <b>echoed</b> on contemporary coinage.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the demise was not purely economic. Privateering {{represented}} a decentralization of power that was inconsistent with both technology {{and the evolution of}} the modern state. It fell victim to changes: steam power and gunnery in ships, more rapid communications that enabled greater central control, and the increasing reluctance of governments everywhere to relinquish power. It was this last that doomed privateering, according to Robinson, the primary modern historian of the Confederate privateers; his opinion <b>is</b> <b>echoed</b> by Luraghi. The effort of the Confederate government turned from privateers to their regularly commissioned raiders, which had spectacularly more success in attacking the northern mercantile fleet.|$|E

25|$|With {{his arms}} crossed {{and his head}} {{slightly}} lowered as he skates from right to left, Grant dominates the canvas. The dramatic impression is enhanced by a low point of view, much in the fashion of Baroque portraiture in the Grand Manner. But for his folded arms, Grant's pose derives from the Apollo Belvedere, a cast of which was present in West's studio. The black tones of a full-skirted coat, elegant smallclothes and shoes are relieved by a white cravat and cuff, a gray fur lapel, a glimpse of tan glove, and silver buckles on the hat, breeches, and shoes; the stylishly tilted hat belonged to the artist. Behind Grant is a winter landscape of restrained tones composed of distant skaters, trees, and a far-off London skyline that includes Westminster Abbey. Grant's figure divides the canvas into contrasting halves: to the right the coat's silhouette undulates gently, and a large bare tree anchors the composition, while the left side, opening onto the gestures of skaters in motion, is activated by {{the shape of his}} protruding elbow and the jagged contour of coat. Beyond the large tree the recession of the distant treeline creates a movement from right to left which <b>is</b> <b>echoed</b> by the disposition of the secondary figures. The overall handling evidences a lightness of touch and a success in integrating figure and landscape that suggests the open-air portraits of Thomas Gainsborough.|$|E
500|$|Linda Catt, an activist, has {{suggested}} that their tactics are [...] "designed to intimidate people and prevent lawful dissent".
