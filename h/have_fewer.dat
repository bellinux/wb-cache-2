5|$|Because of the {{economic}} benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide. A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed that roughly a third of countries <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies. Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.|$|E

5|$|Canada's federal {{structure}} divides government responsibilities {{between the}} federal government and the ten provinces. Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons. Canada's three territories also have legislatures, but these are not sovereign and <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> constitutional responsibilities than the provinces. The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.|$|E

5000|$|Longer lifetime: <b>Having</b> <b>fewer</b> {{moving parts}} also means <b>having</b> <b>fewer</b> parts prone to failure. Failures in other systems are usually {{produced}} by {{aging of the}} component (such as a stretched belt), or stress.|$|R
5|$|Compulsory {{education}} {{is divided into}} ten years. Schools which have all ten years, year one to seven, and years eight to ten are common. Those schools which teach from years eight to ten often have a wider catchment area. The size of institutions is widely varied. In the Reykjavík urban area, schools can be up to 1200 pupils in size. In rural areas, schools can <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> than 10 pupils, and around 50% of schools <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> than 100 pupils. All compulsory education institutions are mixed sex. Many counselling services are available, including help with studies and specific subjects; psychological counselling is also available.|$|E
5|$|Decrease {{aggregate}} demand (GDP) in the short-term, as low-income persons {{who tend to}} spend a large fraction of their additional resources would <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> resources (e.g., ACA subsidies would be eliminated). This effect would be offset in the long-run by the labor supply factors below.|$|E
5|$|Other {{religions}} comprising {{less than}} one per cent of Germany's population are Buddhism with 250,000 adherents (roughly 0.3%), Judaism with 118,000-250.000 adherents (around 0.2%), and Hinduism with some 100,000 adherents (0.1%). All other religious communities in Germany <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> than 50,000 adherents each.|$|E
50|$|Having more {{checkers}} {{is usually}} an advantage, {{because they can}} limit the opponent's options as they mass together.On the other hand, material considerations are not all-important, because <b>having</b> <b>fewer</b> checkers also means <b>having</b> <b>fewer</b> to unite.|$|R

5|$|The {{eggs and}} nymphs are {{under attack by}} parasitoids {{including}} blow flies, flesh flies, and tachinid flies. External parasites of adults and nymphs include mites. Female grasshoppers parasitised by mites produce fewer eggs and thus <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> offspring than unaffected individuals.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{population is}} {{the larger of}} the two. These individuals make their home in states as far north as Connecticut and Massachusetts, and as far south as Maryland. These turtles are known to <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> than 200 habitable sites left, a number that is decreasing.|$|E
5|$|These include {{same-sex}} relationships, single-parent households, adopting individuals, {{and extended}} family systems living together. The nuclear family is also choosing to <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> children {{than in the}} past. The percentage of married-couple households with children under 18 has declined to 23.5% of all households in 2000 from 25.6% in 1990, and from 45% in 1960.|$|E

5|$|After the referendum, {{the ballot}} for Quebec {{elections}} was redesigned {{to reduce the}} size of the space where voters could indicate their choice and the rules on allowable markings were relaxed, so that Deputy Returning Officers would <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> grounds for rejecting ballots. The Quebec government also changed the Electoral Act so that voters would need to show a Canadian passport, Quebec drivers' licence or Quebec provincial health care card at the polling station for identification purposes in future elections.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the unique}} motion-based {{gameplay}} mechanics, the Wii version of the game also supports the GameCube controller, and also the option of using the Classic Controller. The daytime levels for the Wii were altered to accommodate the motion control-based boost mechanic, while night-time levels include a mostly behind-the-back view and different platforming styles and combat mechanics. Developer Dimps, who had past involvement in the Sonic franchise, {{was involved in the}} design of the daytime areas for these versions. In addition, overall, the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> daytime levels than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Because {{scratches}} {{dominate the}} microwear {{texture of the}} teeth, Williams et al. suggested Edmontosaurus was a grazer instead of a browser, which would be predicted to <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> scratches due to eating less abrasive materials. Candidates for ingested abrasives include silica-rich plants like horsetails and soil that was accidentally ingested due to feeding at ground level. The tooth structure indicates combined slicing and grinding capabilities.|$|E

50|$|Injectable {{cladribine}} suppresses the body's {{ability to}} make new blood cells (called Myelosuppression); data from HCL studies showed that about 70% of people taking the drug <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> white blood cells and about 30% developed infections {{and some of those}} progressed to septic shock; about 40% of people taking the drug <b>had</b> <b>fewer</b> red blood cells and became severely anemic; and about 10% of people <b>had</b> too <b>few</b> platelets.|$|R
5|$|Grasshoppers may be {{confused}} with Ensifera (crickets, etc.), but they differ in many aspects; these include the number of segments in their antennae {{and the structure of}} the ovipositor, as well as the location of the tympanal organ and the methods by which sound is produced. Ensiferans have antennae that can be much longer than the body and have at least 20–24 segments, while caeliferans <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> segments in their shorter, stouter antennae.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, W.D. Hamilton {{proposed}} a specific but widely applicable handicap mechanism, parasite-mediated sexual selection. He {{argued that in}} the never-ending co-evolutionary race between hosts and their parasites, sexually selected signals indicate health. This idea was tested in 1994 in barn swallows, a species where males have long tail streamers. Møller found that the males with longer tails, and their offspring, did <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> bloodsucking mites, whereas fostered young did not. The effect was therefore genetic, confirming Hamilton's theory.|$|E
5|$|In general, seabirds live longer, breed {{later and}} <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> young than other birds do, but they invest {{a great deal}} of time in their young. Most species nest in colonies, which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species are famous for {{undertaking}} long annual migrations, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Seabirds can be highly pelagic, coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely.|$|E

5|$|In most amphibians, {{there are}} four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either. Some {{salamanders}} <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> digits and the amphiumas are eel-like in appearance with tiny, stubby legs. The sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs. The caecilians are limbless. They burrow {{in the manner of}} earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body. On the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side.|$|E
5|$|Northern dialects tend to <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> {{classifiers}} than southern ones. 個 ge is {{the only}} classifier found in the Dungan language. All nouns could have just one classifier in some dialects, such as Shanghainese (Wu), the Mandarin dialect of Shanxi, and Shandong dialects. Some dialects such as Northern Min, certain Xiang dialects, Hakka dialects, and some Yue dialects use 隻 for the noun referring to people, rather than 個.|$|E
5|$|On average {{within any}} one population, males tend to <b>have</b> <b>fewer</b> {{spots on the}} {{underside}} and are paler in colour than females. The latter are also larger with a strong female T. alba of a large subspecies weighing over 550g (19.4oz), while males are typically about 10% lighter. Nestlings are covered in white down, but the heart-shaped facial disk becomes visible soon after hatching.|$|E
