5|$|Amin did {{not write}} an autobiography, {{and he did not}} authorize an {{official}} written account of his life. So, there are discrepancies regarding when and where he was born. Most biographical sources claim that he was born in either Koboko or Kampala around 1925. Other unconfirmed sources state Amin's year of birth from as early as 1923 to as late as 1928. Amin's son <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> stated that his father was born in Kampala in 1928.|$|E

2500|$|Powell's chief {{role was}} to garner {{international}} support for a multi-national coalition to mount the invasion. To this end, Powell addressed a plenary session of the United Nations Security Council on February 5, 2003, to argue in favor of military action. Citing numerous anonymous Iraqi defectors, Powell asserted that [...] "there {{can be no doubt}} that Saddam <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more." [...] Powell also stated that there was [...] "no doubt in my mind" [...] that Saddam was working to obtain key components to produce nuclear weapons.|$|E

2500|$|The UK and Swedish governments {{rejected}} the claim. UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Philip Hammond, said the claim was [...] "ridiculous" [...] {{and that the}} group was [...] "made up of lay people", and called Assange a fugitive from justice. UK and Swedish prosecutors called the group's claims irrelevant. The UK maintained it would arrest Assange should he leave the Ecuadorian embassy. Mark Ellis, {{executive director of the}} International Bar Association, stated that the finding is [...] "not binding on British law". United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> said that the finding is based on binding international law.|$|E
2500|$|In September 17, 2006, Tom Curley, AP {{president}} and chief executive, said, [...] "Bilal <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> been held in violation of Iraqi law and in disregard to the Geneva Conventions. He must be charged under the Iraqi system or released immediately." [...] The AP contacted military leaders in Iraq and The Pentagon, and later the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, {{to try to get}} more information about the allegations and to have the case transferred to the Iraqi criminal justice system. [...] According to Curley, the Associated Press had been working quietly until then, but since the US military showed no sign of changing their stance, they considered it best to make the imprisonment public.|$|E
2500|$|After Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990, Powell {{claimed that}} since Britain {{was not an}} ally of Kuwait in the [...] "formal sense" [...] and because {{the balance of power}} in the Middle East had ceased to be a British concern after the end of the British Empire, Britain should not go to war. Powell claimed that [...] "Saddam <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> a long way to go yet before his troops come {{storming}} up the beaches of Kent or Sussex". On 21 October, he wrote, [...] "The world is full of evil men engaged in doing evil things. That does not make us policemen to round them up nor judges to find them guilty and to sentence them. What is so special about the ruler of Iraq that we suddenly discover that we are to be his jailers and his judges?... we as a nation have no interest in the existence or non-existence of Kuwait or, for that matter, Saudi Arabia as an independent state. I sometimes wonder if, when we shed our power, we omitted to shed our arrogance".|$|E

2500|$|The Aleppo rebels used hell cannons, a {{makeshift}} mortar firing gas cylinders packed with explosives and shrapnel. UN High Commissioner For Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> stated that their use is [...] "totally unacceptable" [...] and constitutes indiscriminate attacks {{as they are}} very difficult to aim correctly, frequently killing and maiming civilians in Government-held areas. According to Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein their use is primarily to [...] "terrorize the inhabitants of western Aleppo". The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported in December 2014 that between July and December 2014 the rebels killed 204 civilians using hell cannons. Professor of Law Mark A. Summers of Barry University School of Law, a legal expert previous assigned to the Office of the Prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, wrote that both the uses of barrel bombs and hell cannons is inaccurate and so randomly destructive that their use is per se illegal and thus constitutes either the direct or indiscriminate targeting of civilians and civilian objects. Water supplies in the city {{for tens of thousands of}} people were deliberately cut by the Jabhat al-Nusra group for several days in May 2014. Amnesty International warned that [...] "non-state armed groups have engaged in abductions and hostage-taking, as well as the arbitrary detention, torture, and other mistreatment of prisoners in Aleppo".|$|E
