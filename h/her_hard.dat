500|$|Writing about Cher's musical output {{during the}} 1960s, Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times stated that [...] "Rock was {{subsequently}} {{blessed with the}} staggering blues exclamations of Janis Joplin in the late '60s and the raw poetic force of Patti Smith in the mid-'70s. Yet no one matched the pure, seductive wallop of Cher". By contrast, her vocal performances during the 1970s were described by Eder as [...] "dramatic, highly intense... almost as much 'acted' as sung". First heard in the 1980 record Black Rose, Cher employed sharper, more aggressive vocals in <b>her</b> <b>hard</b> rock-oriented albums, establishing her sexually confident image. For the 1995 album It's a Man's World, she restrained her vocals, singing in higher registers and without vibrato.|$|E

500|$|Simon Reynolds {{wrote about}} a female rocker {{he called the}} Ice Queen: [...] "Ice is the {{opposite}} of all that women are supposed to be: warm, flowing, giving, receptive. Like Lady Macbeth, the Ice Queen has unsexed herself, dammed up her lachrymal and lactation ducts. She offers cold, not comfort. <b>Her</b> <b>hard</b> surfaces can't be penetrated. She is an island, an iceberg." [...] In The Marble Index Nico took this persona (originally embodied by Grace Slick) even further, making a fetish of disconnection and [...] " [...] of a sort of negative nirvana". According to Dazed, this persona has influenced Siouxsie Sioux, Zola Jesus, and Björk. The latter's 2011 album, Biophilia, was described by Rolling Stone as The Marble Indexs [...] "haunted digital sister". The influence of The Marble Index can also be found in the music of Laurel Halo.|$|E

For example, she leaves her child {{in the care of}} his grandmother, just as her own mother left her and her older brother in the care of their grandmother in Caged Bird. Much of Singin' and Swingin′ delves into Angelou's guilt about accepting work that forces her to separate from her young son. As Angelou's friend, scholar Dolly McPherson states, [...] "The saddest part of Singin' and Swingin is the young Guy, who, though deeply loved by Angelou, seems to be shoved into the background whenever a need to satisfy her monetary requirements or theatrical ambitions arises". Despite her great success traveling Europe with the Porgy and Bess tour, she is distressed and full of indecision. For every positive description of her European experiences, there is a lament about Guy that [...] "shuts off" [...] these experiences and prevents her from enjoying the fruit of <b>her</b> <b>hard</b> work.|$|E
500|$|Catherine pressed Jeanne d'Albret {{to attend}} court. Writing {{that she wanted}} to see Jeanne's children, she promised not to harm them. Jeanne replied: [...] "Pardon me if, reading that, I want to laugh, because you want to relieve me of a fear that I've never had. I've never thought that, as they say, you eat little children". When Jeanne did come to court, Catherine {{pressured}} <b>her</b> <b>hard,</b> playing on Jeanne's hopes for her beloved son. Jeanne finally agreed to the marriage between her son and Margaret, so long as Henry could remain a Huguenot. When Jeanne arrived in Paris to buy clothes for the wedding, she was taken ill and died on 9 June 1572, aged forty-three. Huguenot writers later accused Catherine of murdering her with poisoned gloves. The wedding took place on 18 August 1572 at Notre-Dame, Paris. Frieda dismisses this accusation based on the fact Catherine had nothing to gain from her death, once the marriage contract had been signed, although Frieda considered Catherine responsible for Philibert le Vayer, who was Duke of Anjou's favourite.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, Body Language received an average score of 62 based on 17 reviews {{which indicates that}} the album received [...] "generally favourable reviews". Chris True from AllMusic complimented Minogue for expanding her [...] "horizons" [...] and felt that the album was consistent {{and worked as a}} [...] "piece", calling it [...] "stylish without being smarmy, retro without being ironic". He favoured the overall production of the album and praised Minogue for displaying a [...] "sense of class", which he felt was lacking in the work of female artists like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Madonna; he concluded by labelling Body Language a [...] "near perfect pop record" [...] and [...] "what may well be the best album of her [...] career". Keith Caulfield from Billboard was also positive in his review and complimented Minogue for selecting a talented creative team, saying [...] "The sexy, solid set is glued together by danceable beats and Minogue's knack for picking great songs and producers." [...] The Irish Times review of the song called the album a [...] "worthy successor to 2001's smash hit Fever, a supremely danceable collection of electro-pop songs that's clearly in thrall to the 80s" [...] and complimented Minogue's versatile vocal delivery. Ethan Brown from New York was greatly impressed by opening track [...] "Slow", and commented that most of the songs on the album [...] "mimic its sound, none of the other songs on Body Language comes close to the achievement of [...] "Slow"". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt Body Language was a better album than Fever, calling it [...] "less immediate and more experimental, a midway point between the alternative/electronica of 1997's Impossible Princess and Minogue's more mainstream post-millennium work", and praised it for being cohesive. He also complimented Minogue's [...] "willingness to try something new – even if it's within the confines of dance-pop – is what's made her an international sensation 15 years running". Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone favoured the sensual nature of the album, calling it [...] "fantastic" [...] and that [...] "At thirty-five, she's ten times hotter than she was ten years ago – on Body Language, Kylie Minogue definitely sounds like she has a few more tricks stored on <b>her</b> <b>hard</b> drive than Britney [...] or Christina [...] ".|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} summary {{synopsis of}} the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states, [...] "A poor widow who supports her two children, one a baby and the other girl of six, by scrubbing, weakens under <b>her</b> <b>hard</b> work, and finally dies. Marie, the 'little mother,' anxious that her home may not be broken up, calls {{on one of her}} mother's employers and requests that she be given a chance to take the dead woman's place. The artist, a wealthy, good-hearted man, pleased with the child's pluck, laughingly employs her, and makes her believe that she is really doing all the 'chores.' The artist's kindness, much to his surprise, brings him recompense one [...] One of his models plots to fleece him. She calls at his studio, faints in his arms, and when her confederate rushes in with a policeman, she makes charges that lead to the arrest of the innocent artist. Just as the policeman is leading her benefactor away, the little scrub woman sees what is happening. She follows the party to the police station, but is afraid to enter. When the complainant and her husband come out, the child is impressed with the fact that they seem to be on the best of terms. Her suspicions are aroused, and she shadows them like a regular detective. What crook would ever imagine that a little girl, wheeling a baby carriage, was a sleuth? This pair certainly did not, for when they meet a new friend in the park, they stop to tell him how they successfully arranged to trim a rich artist, never doubting that he would pay liberally to have the case dropped. The little girl, from her place in hiding, heard the story. So the little girl found a policeman, and told him about it. And the policeman went with her to the hiding place, and heard enough to warrant him in making what he afterward described as a 'two handed collar.' The adventurous and her confederate were hailed to the police station and locked up, while the artist was set free in a hurry. The result is that there is now a 'scrub woman' whose duties are a sinecure although the wages are high, {{and the future of the}} 'little mother' and her baby are assured." ...|$|E
