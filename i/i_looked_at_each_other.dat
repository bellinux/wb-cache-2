60|$|Euphemia and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> This {{explained}} {{the absence of}} the rustic seat and the dipper.|$|E
60|$|John Paul and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in astonishment, and we, too, laughed heartily. It {{was indeed}} an odd coincidence.|$|E
60|$|Some {{carelessness}} on {{the part}} of the attendant had left on the table the writing materials that had been needed for her confession. She was using them now--when death on the scaffold was literally within a few hours of her--to sketch a portrait of the female warder, who was on the watch! The Doctor and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other; and now the sincerity of her repentance was something that I began to question, too.|$|R

6000|$|I {{had just}} ranged the {{decanters}} {{in a row}} before old Mr. Ablewhite (who represented {{the master of the}} house), when there came a sound from the terrace which, startled me out of my company manners on the instant. Mr. Franklin and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other; it was the sound of the Indian drum. As I live by bread, here were the jugglers returning to us with the return of the Moonstone to the house! ...|$|R

6000|$|Bickley and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{and were}} silent. Mentally we had collapsed. Who {{could begin to}} discuss {{statements}} built upon such a foundation of gigantic and paralysing falsehoods? ...|$|E

6000|$|There is a pile {{of these}} arrears very soon, and it swells like a rolling snowball. The bigger it gets, the more stupid I get. The case is so hopeless, and I feel that I am wallowing in such a bog of nonsense, that I give up all idea of getting out, and abandon myself to my fate. The despairing way in which my mother and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other, as <b>I</b> blunder on, is truly melancholy. But the {{greatest}} effect in these miserable lessons is when my mother (thinking nobody is observing her) tries {{to give me the}} cue by the motion of her lips. At that instant, Miss Murdstone, who has been lying in wait for nothing else all along, says in a deep warning voice: ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 32 - 33) I have ported {{the original}} C GoJin program to Java and redesigned it {{to support the}} addition of heuristics to Monte Carlo/UCT. By implementing the Go rules using Java, I was able to more easily maintain meta information about the game {{to use in the}} heuristics. The overhead of maintaining the meta information needed to be optimized significantly {{due to the fact that}} Monte Carlo/UCT depends heavily on speed in order to provide reasonable performance. Utilizing CGOS and gogui-twogtp, I was able to measure the various improvements I made against the basic Java port with no meta information. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> stage of the program, starting with meta information, adding various top level heuristics, and finally adding heuristics to the simulations. My tests focused on finding out how strongly all the extra overhead affected the Monte Carlo/UCT algorithm and whether it was worth the sacrifice in speed in exchange for more intelligent move analysis...|$|R

6000|$|Some {{weeks passed}} in this way, when {{one day a}} woman came in to buy bread. In paying for it, she laid down several pieces of money, {{one of which was}} bad. The baker {{perceived}} this, and declined to take it, demanding another in its place. The woman, for her part, refused to take it back, declaring it was perfectly good, but the baker would {{have nothing to do with}} it. [...] "It is really such a bad imitation," [...] he exclaimed at last, [...] "that even my dog would not be taken in. Here Rufus! Rufus!" [...] and hearing his voice, I jumped on to the counter. The baker threw down the money before me, and said, [...] "Find out if there is a bad coin." [...] <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> in turn, and then laid my paw on the false one, glancing at the same time at my master, so as to point it out.|$|R
6000|$|This horrid aspersion (I regret I am {{no longer}} exposed to that sort of insult) made me huffy too.

Benioff stated, [...] "We had this meeting with George Martin where we're trying {{to get as much}} information as possible out of him, and probably the most shocking revelation he had for us was when he told us the origin of Hodor and how that name came about.

[...] Weiss continued, [...] "It {{was just one of the}} saddest and most affecting things.

6000|$|Pierre and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{in dismay}} which {{amounted}} almost to fear. We had but just succeeded in paving {{a way for}} ourselves to enter the town at will, and through Saul's hasty temper all the fat was in the fire! ...|$|E

40|$|The early 1990 s saw {{a kind of}} {{crystallisation}} in gaming aesthetics, {{centred on}} games that either squinted towards Gothic or outright claimed {{a place in the}} culture and tradition: Warhammer 40, 000 and Vampire: the Masquerade on the tabletop, Alone in the Dark and Wolfenstein on the PC. These games are genre-defining, persistent, and - to varying degrees - pretty damn Gothic. They’ve lasted for twenty, twenty-five years, and have carried their core aesthetic projects into the twenty-first century. Why? What is it about the Nineties ‘grimdark’ aesthetic that makes it last so long? To answer that question <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> of these titles and establish its core 'negative aesthetic', establishing how Gothic shaped gameplay during the early 1990 s and beyond. I approach each in terms of aesthetic theory, {{following in the footsteps of}} Graeme Kirkpatrick by establishing literally how the games make us feel, and go on to collectively place them in the context of a recurring fin-de-siecle cultural moment which has previously seen the flowering of the Gothic novel and Decadent art/writing...|$|R

40|$|If {{cosmetic}} surgery {{has become the}} cultural lens through which Americans <b>look</b> <b>at</b> issues of beauty and ugliness (Haiken 1997), then minor bodily stigma is the personal lens through which we scrutinize our bodies and self-diagnose our own flaws {{in the first place}} (Ellis 1998). In this dissertation, I interrogated the stories of eight women who struggled with two specific minor bodily stigmas [...] strabismus (crossed eyes) and micromastia (small breasts). Cosmetic surgery presents a potential 2 ̆ 2 cure 2 ̆ 2 for both of these conditions, however, as some of my interviewees could testify, the results are unpredictable. While some women reported being grateful that they could try to resculpt their bodies with surgery, others were too afraid to try, or annoyed that the option existed in the first place. Using a Grounded Theory approach, I combined autoethographic techniques with interactive interviewing to collect and interpret my data about how individuals cope with, and talk about, minor bodily stigma in an age of {{cosmetic surgery}}. The two flaws I chose to examine carry a great deal of cultural significance because in the West, eyes are revered as 2 ̆ 2 windows to the soul, 2 ̆ 2 while breasts are regarded as powerful symbols of sexuality. Consequently, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> woman 2 ̆ 7 s exposure to culture at three levels [...] the mass media, the local culture, and the circle of family and friends. First, I wanted to find out how these women identified themselves as flawed in the first place, and what impact their perceived stigma had upon their lives. I wanted to know if, and how, they communicated to others about their minor bodily stigmas. Next, I delineated the eight coping strategies outlined by my interviewees and examined the efficacy of <b>each.</b> Finally, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> how <b>each</b> woman made and communicated her decision regarding whether or not to pursue cosmetic surgery as a solution to her minor bodily stigma. I asked those who had surgery to elaborate on their decision and its outcome...|$|R
