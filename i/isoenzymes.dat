40|$|Myosin <b>isoenzyme</b> {{profiles}} of rat and chicken embryonic cardiac myocytes were studied during differentiation and growth in vitro by native-gel electrophoresis and assay of Ca 2 +-activated ATPase. The electrophoretic pattern of myosin extracted from 18 -day-embryonic-rat myocytes after 7 days in culture exhibits three <b>isoenzyme</b> bands, V 1, V 2 and V 3, {{of which the}} slow-migrating V 3 is predominant.

However, the <b>isoenzyme</b> profile of the 7 -day-old culture {{differs from that of}} its counterpart in vivo, as well as from that of the young and adult rat ventricles, the last two containing the predominant fast-migrating component, V 1. When embryonic cardiac myocytes were grown in vitro for 7 days in a medium containing a physiological concentration of L-thyroxine (T 4), myosin <b>isoenzyme</b> {{profiles of}} these cells shifted to the adult form, with <b>isoenzyme</b> V 1 predominating after day 4 of culture. The 7 -day-old intact embryonic-chicken ventricles and isolated myocytes showed a single myosin <b>isoenzyme</b> band after 7 days of culture that resembles the pattern seen for the adult chicken. T 4 had no effect on the electrophoretic mobility of this <b>isoenzyme</b> pattern. ATPase activity of <b>isoenzyme</b> V 1 in cultured rat myocytes treated with T 4 was comparable with that of V 1 in the untreated adult heart. This study demonstrates that ATPase activity of the chicken myosin <b>isoenzyme</b> is significantly lower than that of <b>isoenzyme</b> V 1, but is comparable with that of rat V 3. This study shows that the expression of myosin <b>isoenzyme</b> profiles in cultured rat cardiac myocytes does not fully represent the situation in vivo.

Often these enzymes are <b>Isoenzymes,</b> of traditional glycolysis enzymes, that vary in their susceptibility to traditional feedback inhibition. The increase in glycolytic activity ultimately counteracts the effects of hypoxia by generating sufficient ATP from this anaerobic pathway.

25|$|Ketamine is {{absorbable}} by intravenous, intramuscular, oral, and topical routes due to {{both its}} water and lipid solubilities.

Intermediate in the biotransformation of norketamine into dehydronorketamine is the hydroxylation of norketamine into hydroxynorketamine by CYP2B6 and CYP2A6. Dehydronorketamine, followed by norketamine, is the most prevalent metabolite detected in urine.
