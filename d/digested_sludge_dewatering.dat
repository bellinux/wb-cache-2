This {{study investigated}} the effects of acidification and oxidation on EPS properties and dewaterability of anaerobic <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> in Fenton treatment in order to unravel the underlying mechanism of sludge conditioning. The results indicated that <b>sludge</b> <b>dewatering</b> property was improved after acidification treatment. Meanwhile, fluorescence analysis revealed that the protein-like substances were effectively removed from sludge bulk after acidification treatment. Acidification and Fenton oxidation showed a significant synergetic effect in enhancing <b>sludge</b> <b>dewatering</b> process. Solubilization and decomposition of bound EPS occurred synchronously during Fenton conditioning. Oxidation process is very likely to play a more important role in sludge conditioning than Fenton coagulation. According to pilot test, Fenton treatment performed much better in cake moisture content reduction than chemical conditioning with traditional inorganic coagulants. Additionally, full-scale application of Fenton conditioning will not have detrimental effects on performance of wastewater treatment system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{paper will}} {{report about the}} {{experiences}} matured at an Austrian large wastewater treatment plant of 720. 000 population equivalents, where anaerobically <b>digested</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> is further stabilised under aerobic conditions. Enhanced stabilisation of the anaerobically <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> was required at the plant {{in order to get}} a permit for landfill disposal of the dewatered stabilized sludge. By implementing a post-aeration treatment (SRT~ 6 d; 36 °C) after anaerobic digestion the organic content of the anaerobically well <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> can be decreased by 16 %. Investigations on site showed that during <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> post-aeration anoxic phases for denitrification are needed to provide stable process conditions. In this way the pH value can be kept in a more favourable range for micro-organisms and concrete structures. Additionally, inhibition of the biological process due to nitrite accumulation can be avoided. By optimising the aeration/pause ratio ~ 45 % of total nitrogen in <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> can be removed. This significantly improves nitrogen removal efficiency at the wastewater treatment plant. NH 4 -removal occurs mainly through nitritation and denitritation with an efficiency of 98 %.

The dewatering characteristics were assessed by measuring the specific resistance to filtration through a modified time to filter testing apparatus. The solids content of the dosed samples was determined by a mass balance around the system and compared to the original solids content in the activated sludge. Test results indicated that the use of nanoparticle addition did modify the structure of the sludge and provided benefits in terms of the dewatering rate. The samples dosed with nanoparticles exhibited faster water removal indicating a more permeable cake. The sludge was also tested with a larger particle powdered activated carbon as a comparison.

First part of this study focused on one of the biological approaches to reduce the excess sludge that can be achieved by aquatic worms in short period of time.

Phosphorus recovery methods from wastewater or sludge can be categorized by {{the origin of the}} used matter (wastewater, <b>sludge</b> liquor, <b>digested</b> or non-digested <b>sludge,</b> ash) or by the type of recovery processes (precipitation, wet-chemical extraction and precipitation, thermal treatment). Research on phosphorus recovery methods from sewage sludge has been carried out in Sweden and Germany since around 2003, but the technologies currently under development are not yet cost effective, given the current price of phosphorus on the world market.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In 1994 for {{the first}} time massive incrustations in the {{centrifuges}} treating the <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> were detected in some wastewater treatment plants (WWTP’s) of the Berliner Wasserbetriebe, which were, as was found out later, mainly due to the precipitation of white MAP (magnesium ammonium phosphate = struvite) deposits with small portions of different calcium phosphate compounds. Obviously, the wastewater purification process used, with enhanced biological phosphorus removal and concentrated streams of <b>digesting</b> <b>sludge,</b> favours the formation of incrustations during sludge treatment. These incrustations were the cause of a lot of operational problems. To prevent incrustations, modifications in the process engineering technology have been applied after several studies and trials. Deliberate extraction of the CO 2, e. g. by air injection through a fine-bubble surface aeration system {{at the bottom of the}} <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> storage tank just before the centrifuges, causes the pH to rise to approx. 8 and results in induced struvite precipitation. This technology enables a precipitation product suitable for recycling. In general several processes for further separation of the MAP from the <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> are considered. First trials were carried out using hydro-cyclones. A subsequent second hydro-cyclone stage allowed a further increase in the P-concentration to approx. 40 kg/m, giving a yield of phosphorus of 20 %. This corresponds with P-load of approx. 316 kg/day and amounts to 18 % of the P inlet load in the WWTP Waßmannsdorf. To recovery the separated precipitated MAP, particularly from the <b>digested</b> <b>sludge...</b>|$|R

In 1989 the Perry Oaks {{site was}} closed and the land reclaimed for Heathrow Terminal 5 with new <b>sludge</b> <b>dewatering</b> provided at nearby Iver South.|$|R
40|$|Sludge {{produced}} from {{wastewater treatment plants}} is not only rich in nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), but also contains toxic organic contaminants and pathogenic organisms which can be potentially hazardous to health of plants, animals and humans. In order to minimize the pathogen contamination in sludge before land application, a minimum of one year of sewage sludge storage has been proposed by Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. Emission of greenhouse gas (GHG) carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4) during storage of sludge has been observed, however, studies {{on the influence of}} moisture change in the stored sludge caused by natural evaporation and precipitation on the amount of gas emitted are hardly found. A laboratory study was performed to determine the effect of drying and rewetting of sewage sludge on greenhouse gas emission during the storage phase. Emissions from two types of <b>digested</b> sewage <b>sludge</b> were investigated; mesophilically <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> and thermophilically <b>digested</b> <b>sludge.</b> For each substrate, three types of treatments were applied; (1) drying/rewetting (17 days/ 15 days), (2) drying/rewetting (17 days/ 15 days) with sludge sampling for chemical analysis {{at the end of the}} drying phase and (3) Control treatment for which moisture content of sludge during the whole storage phase (32 days) was kept as constant as possible. Results from the experiment showed that drying slightly reduced the accumulated emission of CO 2 from both substrates and emission of N 2 O from thermophilically <b>digested</b> <b>sludge.</b> After the irrigation was applied, a substantial increase in the daily emission of CO 2 from mesophilically <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> and daily emission of N 2 O from both substrates was observed. Drying and rewetting hardly made any impact on CH 4 emission. Higher carbon emissions from mesophilically <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> than that of the thermophilically <b>digested</b> <b>sludge</b> were observed. Reasons to the observations could be due to the difference in: (1) carbon/nitrogen ratio between the two substrates; (2) different moisture content of the two substrates and (3) different digestion treatments applied when producing the sewage sludge...|$|R
