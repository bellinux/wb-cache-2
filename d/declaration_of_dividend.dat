40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{empirical}} {{findings of a}} questionnaire survey about corporate dividend policy addressed to finance directors of foreign listed companies listed on Karachi stock exchange. We survey 60 foreign listed companies and the questionnaire is asked from their finance directors like earlier studies (for example, Brav et al., 2005 in the US and Dhanani, 2005 in the UK) in order to visualize their view and understanding about the dividend decision. Our survey resulted into some very important points to be noted. The dividend decision is influenced by market price of share, dividend growth and smoothening of dividend. The firms give importance to the dividend {{as it was in}} past and the growth is considered at time of <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividend.</b> The alternative of dividend is investment consideration and the firms always issue dividend to attract the retail investors at top priority. Rather than reducing dividends, the firms would raise new funds to undertake investments. The dividend decision is influenced by the competitor policy and the fear of signaling of shortage of profitable investment. The results demonstrate that foreign listed companies are more concerned with dividend policy...|$|E

40|$|United States Generally Accepted Accounting Practice ("US GAAP") {{generally}} requires {{taxes to}} be measured at the rate applicable to distributed profits, while International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") requires the undistributed rate to be used. This current conflict between US GAAP and IFRS has particular relevance in South Africa, which has a dual tax' system {{as a result of}} Secondary Tax on Companies ("STC") being levied when a company distributes its profits. Currently, under US GAAP, South African companies would be required to raise a liability for the tax that would become payable' on the future distribution of profits, while under IFRS, this is only recognised when the profits are distributed. The objective of the study is, therefore, to consider the timing of the recognition of a liability for STC. The literature study has indicated strong arguments for both the recognition of a inability for STC prior to the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> a <b>dividend</b> and the non-recognition of a liability for STC prior to the dec 1 aration <b>of</b> a <b>dividend.</b> The empirical study, however, concluded that the recognition of ability prior to the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> a <b>dividend</b> is not appropriate, as a majority of the respondents believe that no "past event" has occurred and therefore the definition of a liability in terms of the IASB Framework is not satisfied. The results of the empirical study, however, also indicate that if the "past event” hurdle could be overcome, uncertainty exists as to whether the recognition of a liability for STC prior to the declaration is appropriate. This is as a result of mixed opinions among the respondents as to whether the "probability" and "measurability" criteria, in terms of the IASB Framework, could be satisfied prior to the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> a <b>dividend...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Money {{market funds}} seek a stable net asset value, or NAV per share (which is {{generally}} [...] $1.00 in the United States); they aim to never lose money. The $1.00 is maintained through the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> to shareholders, typically daily, at an amount {{equal to the}} fund's net income. If a fund's NAV drops below $1.00, {{it is said that}} the fund [...] "broke the buck." [...] For SEC registered money funds, maintaining the $1.00 flat NAV is usually accomplished under a provision under Rule 2a-7 of the 40 Act that allows a fund to value its investments at amortized cost rather than market value, provided that certain conditions are maintained. One such condition involves a side-test calculation of the NAV that uses the market value of the fund's investments. The fund's published, amortized value may not exceed this market value by more than 1/2 cent per share, a comparison that is generally made weekly. If the variance does exceed $0.005 per share, the fund could be considered to have broken the buck, and regulators may force it into liquidation.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{this paper}} we study the {{dividend}} optimization {{problem for a}} corporation or a financial institution when the management faces (regulatory) implementation delays. We consider several cash reservoir models for the firm including two mean-reverting processes, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and square-root processes. Since the cash flow structure of different companies have different qualitative behaviors, {{it makes sense to}} use different diffusions to model them. The delay causes significant difficulties to the optimization problem since the cash reservoir fluctuates during the delay period. We provide a uniform mathematical framework to analyze all the models and provide optimal threshold strategies at which the management initiates actions, i. e., <b>declaration</b> and payment <b>of</b> <b>dividends.</b> Our solution depends on a new characterization of the value function for one-dimensional diffusions and provide easily implementable algorithms to find the optimal control and the value function. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} survey on dividends shows that more explanation is needed though existing theories contribute considerably {{to the understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> including the rationale <b>of</b> paying <b>dividends,</b> smoothing <b>of</b> <b>dividends,</b> and greater frequency <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> payments compared to stock repurchases. The purpose of this thesis is to explain the dividend phenomena using a reputation model {{in the world of}} imperfect information. In a two-period version of the model, the rationale <b>of</b> paying <b>dividends</b> and smoothing is analyzed. However, the reputation effect and the time pattern <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> cannot be easily accommodated. We extend the model into a three-period model in which the behavior <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> through time, and the market response on the change in dividends are analyzed. The reputation effect is incorporated such that the reliability of signalling improves with the passage of time. ^ New empirical results which support the reputation model are presented. The market response to the initial dividend announcement is analyzed using all the cases <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> initiation recorded on the CRSP daily stock files from July 2, 1962, to December 31, 1987. For firms which announce dividends during their first year on a major exchange, the abnormal return on the announcement date <b>of</b> initial <b>dividends</b> is not significant. Also, the change in the magnitude of the market response to the change in dividends through time is analyzed. We group the announcements <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> increases according to the number of years passed after the initiation <b>of</b> <b>dividends.</b> The market 2 ̆ 7 s response to unexpected dividend increases in earlier periods is smaller than the case <b>of</b> unexpected <b>dividend</b> increases in later periods. ^ The reputation model adds a new perspective to the analysis of dividends: the time aspect <b>of</b> <b>dividends,</b> that is, the effect of a consistent stream <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> payments on the value of a firm. This model has direct applicability to all areas <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> to better explain the dividend phenomena. ...|$|R

40|$|Dividend {{policy is}} the set of {{guidelines}} a company uses to decide how much of its earnings it will pay out to shareholders. When a company earns profits from operations, management can do {{one of two things}} with those profits. It can choose to retain them - essentially reinvesting them into the company with the hope of creating more profits and thus further stock appreciation. The alternative is to distribute a portion of the profits to shareholders in the form <b>of</b> <b>dividends.</b> The present paper highlight different approaches <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> policy which are residual, hybrid and stability dividend approach. Companies using the residual dividend policy choose to rely on internally generated equity to finance any new projects. As a result, dividend payments can come out of the residual or leftover equity only after all project capital requirements are met. The fluctuation <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> created by the residual policy significantly contrasts with the certainty <b>of</b> the <b>dividend</b> stability policy. With the stability policy, quarterly dividends are set at a fraction of yearly earnings. This policy reduces uncertainty for investors and provides them with income.

40|$|More {{recently}} {{researchers have}} turned to analyze how the tax structure, rather than the overall tax level, affects economic performance.

40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} a {{generalized}} friction model {{to test the}} information effect <b>of</b> <b>dividends.</b> The proposed model resolves the problem <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> stickiness in the time-series data and provides a more reliable estimate for the relation between unexpected changes in dividends and earnings. Unlike previous studies, we specifically consider the dynamic partial adjustment <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> in estimating the expected dividend component. Our results contain several important findings. First, the results support the contention that dividend changes reflect both expected and unexpected permanent earnings changes. Since Miller and Modigliani (1961) proposed the information hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>dividends,</b> financial {{researchers have sought to}} answer questions concerning whether dividends convey information and, if they do, what types of information are contained in dividends. The results in this study show that dividends are strongly related to a firm 2 ̆ 7 s permanent earnings estimates. Our results also show that dividend changes signal changes in management 2 ̆ 7 s views of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s future earnings prospects. The abnormal (unexpected) dividend, which is the difference between the current dividend and the conditional expectation <b>of</b> the current <b>dividend,</b> has on average a significant positive relation with the unexpected changes in the firm 2 ̆ 7 s permanent earnings. Second, there is evidence that the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> signaling depends on firm-specific characteristics. Consistent with the existing dividend signaling theory, the strength <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> signaling is negatively related to the firm 2 ̆ 7 s systematic risk, external equity financing, and size and positively related to net investments and the degree <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> smoothing. Third, our results suggest that the generalized friction model is a more suitable framework for examining the information content <b>of</b> <b>dividends.</b> Watts (1973) took an approach similar to this study to examine the information effect <b>of</b> <b>dividends...</b>|$|R

The reason for high sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> size on the profitability and debt level can be found in high financial constraints under which Croatian companies operate...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} insight in <b>dividend</b> policy <b>of</b> publicly {{listed companies}} in Bosnia and Herzegovina and investigates appearance <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> smoothing behavior. The results show increase in portion <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> paying companies over time while dividend smoothing phenomenon is virtually non-existent. On the other hand, when companies decide to pay dividends they, on average, distribute high portion of profit to shareholders. The paper also provides discussion about capital market development, investor protection and ownership concentration as potential factors affecting importance <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> payouts. Research {{results indicate that}} insufficiently developed capital market characterized with low investor protection and concentrated ownership structure undermine the importance <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> smoothing practices...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} cooperative environments with externalities (games in partition function form) {{and provide}} a recursive definition <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> for each coalition and any partition of the players it belongs to. We show that with this definition and equal sharing <b>of</b> these <b>dividends</b> the averaged sum <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> for each player, over all the coalitions that contain the player, coincides with the corresponding average value of the player. We then construct weighted Shapley values by departing from equal division <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> and finally, for each such value, provide a bidding mechanism implementing it. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{examines the}} policy <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> by using dividend signaling theory and rent extraction hypothesis. The policy {{can be seen}} from the change <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> published by company. The first hypothesis is tested by event study, the second hypothesis is tested by the paired samples t test, and the third hypothesis is tested by independent samples t test. The analysis implemented to 121 non financial companies that listed in Indonesia stock exchange at 2002 - 2006. The result of this research shows that when the company publishes the increasing <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> it makes the market act positively and when the company publishes decreasing <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> at makes the market negatively. This act positively and negatively {{can be seen from}} average abnormal return that positive significant and negative significant on the dividend announcement date. The result also shows there is difference between the profitabilitas of company now with profitabilitas of company in the future that published the increasing (decreasing) <b>of</b> <b>dividend.</b> The result can be seen from average ROE t+ 1 > average ROE t on the increasing <b>of</b> <b>dividend,</b> and average ROE t+ 1 < average ROE t on the decreasing <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> with significant 5 %. The result supports dividend signaling theory. But when the market interprets increasing (decreasing) <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> on the companies have majority stockholders (controlling shareholder) and minority stockholder as the signal of controlling shareholder whether they willing and unwilling to do expropriation toward the minority stockholder. The result of this research shows there is not difference of market reaction that be grown by the companies have controlling shareholder and by the companies have not controlling shareholder on the increasing (decreasing) <b>of</b> <b>dividend.</b> The result does not support rent entraction hypothesis...|$|R
