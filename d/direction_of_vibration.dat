To do so, a pin-on-disc apparatus having facility of vibrating the test samples at different direction is designed and fabricated. The <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> is horizontal. Horizontal vibration is created along (longitudinal direction) and perpendicular (transverse direction) to the sliding direction. The experimental setup has the facility to vary the amplitudes and frequencies of vibration while velocity of vibration is kept constant. During the experiment, relative humidity, roughness, frequency, amplitude and <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> are varied. The observed ranges of relative humidity and surface roughness were 40 %- 80 % and 0. 125 - 2. 5 μm (RMS) respectively. Results show that friction co-efficient decreases {{with the increase of}} relative humidity for horizontal vibration. Friction coefficient is very high at very low roughness and it tends to be high at very high roughness for horizontal direction. It is also observed that the variation of friction co-efficient has a particular relationship with the relative humidity and roughness under horizontal vibration...|$|E

30|$|It {{is found}} that that the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{vibration}}</b> is along the z direction. The vibration balance position {{is below the}} horizontal plane of planar elastic tube bundle subjected to the earth gravity. The red arrow represents the instantaneous vibration direction. At the time of τ/ 4 and 3 τ/ 4, the planar elastic tube bundle reaches the position of peak and valley, respectively. For the velocity 0.2  m/s, the planar elastic tube bundle is still below the horizontal plane at the position of peak. While the planar elastic tube bundle is almost over the horizontal plane at the position of peak in the velocity 0.5  m/s. The reason behind {{this is that the}} fluid force generated by increasing velocity overcomes the effect of earth gravity. It means that the vibration balance position will be raised because of the increasing fluid force.|$|E

40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to vibration {{transmitted to the}} operators of hand-held power tools has been related to symptoms <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> white finger (VWF) disease, also known as "Raynaud's Phenomenon of Occupational Origin". Many subjective and objective epidemiological, and clinical studies have established the prevalence rates and vibration related symptoms, such as VWF disease, loss of muscle strength, injuries to bones and joints, and disorders of the central nervous system. The mechanism leading to these disorders, however, remains almost unknown. The biodynamic response characteristics of the hand-arm system, subject to handle vibration are investigated through: (i) measurement and synthesis of driving point mechanical impedance; (ii) study of hand-grip pressure distribution to gain an insight to a probable mechanism leading to VWF disease; (iii) study of electromyography of finger flexor muscles to enhance an understanding <b>of</b> the <b>vibration</b> induced loss <b>of</b> muscle and grip strength; and (iv) study <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> transmissibility <b>of</b> the hand-arm system and the protection offered by so-called "anti-vibration" gloves. The biodynamic response of the hand-arm system is investigated for sinusoidal as well as stochastic excitations in the three orthogonal <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration.</b> Linear and nonlinear analytical models with constant and grip force dependent parameters are developed to characterize the dynamic response of the hand-arm system. A comparison of the model response to the measured data revealed that the nonlinear analytical models with grip force dependent parameters can accurately predict the hand-arm vibration response for different hand-grip forces over a wide frequency range <b>of</b> tool <b>vibration.</b> Further, the measured data {{reported in the literature}} are synthesized to propose a range of idealized values of driving point impedance in all the three <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration.</b> The hand response to impinged and transmitted vibration is investigated through measurement and analysis of distribution of dynamic forces at the hand-handle interface, and electrical activity of the finger flexor muscles. A sensing grid comprising of flexible pressure sensors was fabricated to measure the interface pressure under static and dynamic conditions. The pressure distribution is related to impaired blood flow, and thus to the probable mechanism leading to the onset of VWF disease. The primary injury mechanisms are further investigated using electromyography (EMG) of the finger flexor muscles, the muscle group responsible for exerting the grip force on the handle. Analysis of the results showed that EMG of muscle group under vibration is as high as 6 times the EMG measured under static grip condition. A methodology is proposed to measure the hand-transmitted vibration and to assess the performance of the anti-vibration gloves.
