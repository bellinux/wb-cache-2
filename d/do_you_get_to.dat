500|$|Games in the Guitar Hero series {{have been}} {{generally}} well received by critics. The initial games were highly praised by reviewers. Neversoft's first {{entry to the}} series, Guitar Hero III, {{was considered to be}} too difficult, with many difficult songs presenting players with [...] "walls of notes"; the developers later acknowledged this. Subsequent efforts in Guitar Hero: Aerosmith and Guitar Hero World Tour were seen to have some improvements, with Guitar Hero: Metallica considered to be a well-polished title and, at that time, the best Guitar Hero title Neversoft has produced. Guitar Hero 5s improvements toward social gameplay were complemented by reviewers and considered a further improvement upon the series. Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "An addictive videogame provides the illusion of musical mastery for even the least gifted:. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Carnegie Hall? Tap, tap, tap." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2007, Carlson {{was invited}} to host many of the world's top chefs as part of Charlie Trotter's 20th anniversary celebration. At first Carlson {{declined}} the offer, but reconsidered saying [...] "how often <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> cook for those cats?" [...] The event was only eleven days away, and Carlson was ill-equipped to handle the large party of famous chefs. [...] He fired a cook {{he did not feel}} was worthy and had to borrow the services of his former, and Grant Achatz's current, sous-chef Nathan Klingbail. [...] He had to buy more plates and went virtually without sleep. [...] "You couldn’t imagine the anxiety," [...] Carlson explains.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was full}} of methods; but they never led him {{anywhere}} without the coincidence. However, we might try to figure it out. What time <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the museum?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> town?" [...] asked Beth, {{greeting}} the boy cordially. [...] "And why didn't you let us {{know you}} were on the way from far-off Los Angeles?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Ravelli (Chico): [...] "How {{is it you}} got to be Roscoe W. Chandler?" [...] Chandler: [...] "Say, how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> be an Italian?" [...] Ravelli: [...] "Never mind—whose {{confession}} is this?" ...|$|R
2500|$|This {{old joke}} {{has become part}} of the {{folklore}} of the hall, but its origins remain a mystery. According to The New York Times, the main player in the story has been described at various times as either an unnamed man, violinist Jascha Heifetz or the pianist Arthur Rubinstein. On its webpage, Carnegie Hall quotes the wife of violinist Mischa Elman as having perhaps the best story of its origin: [...] "One day, after a rehearsal that hadn’t pleased Elman, the couple was leaving Carnegie Hall by the backstage entrance when they were approached by two tourists looking for the hall’s entrance. Seeing his violin case, they asked, 'How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Carnegie Hall?' Without looking up and continuing on his way, Elman simply replied, 'Practice.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|One of his harshest critics was the New Criterions Hilton Kramer, {{who sees}} Krens as a [...] "bureaucrat" [...] who has caused {{disaster}} {{at a major}} cultural institution. [...] Kramer's reaction to The Art of the Motorcycle was condemnation, and the hint of scandal over the financing of a Guggenheim retrospective {{of the work of}} fashion designer Giorgio Armani elicited withering attacks. [...] The charge that the Guggenheim had sold out to the mass market coincided with hip-hop at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston featuring guitar design, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art presenting rock music performance costumes. [...] Krens dismissed the suggestion that Armani rented out the Guggenheim to show its wares, saying, [...] "It's a non-story. Who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> support an institution? People who have relationships with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Coonan {{spoke to}} David Brown from Radio Times about the crash, {{where it was}} said that Carl would [...] "show just how evil he can be" [...] by causing it. Coonan said that Carl causes the crash because he wants to depose Phil as [...] "top boy" [...] in Albert Square, saying it is [...] "such an insane thing to <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> see how nuts Carl is. He doesn't care if Phil dies yet he risks {{damaging}} himself as well. [...] He realises he will {{have to get rid of}} him." [...] He also said that Phil is a [...] "major barrier" [...] for Carl getting what he wants, so he could either go into business with Phil or eliminate him. On filming the crash, Coonan explained that he was inside the car when the glass was detonated, and he suffered cuts on his leg and hand. Brown said the crash looks [...] "visceral and intense" [...] on screen, and said that Phil is not scared of Carl because he sees him as a [...] "wannabe" [...] and a [...] "young pretender", but added that [...] "there is obviously more to [...] than [...] realises." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the hospital?" [...] asked Uncle Ben, anxious <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{over this}} part of the story, for Rose was now as pale as if she {{actually}} saw the scene described.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{heard that}} you had been at several of the runs, {{and of course you}} are in with some of our fellows. How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know about the {{entrance}} to this place?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But how {{on earth}} <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know about me," [...] Mr. Dunster asked, [...] "and my errand? You couldn't {{possibly}} have got me here in an ordinary way. It was an entire fluke." ...|$|R
2500|$|Much of the pregame hype {{surrounded}} {{the conflict between}} Parcells and Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Kraft {{took control of the}} team after Parcells was hired, {{and the two of them}} had different ideas on how to run the organization. Six days before the Super Bowl, in an article by Will McDonough, the Boston Globe reported Parcells would leave the Patriots after the Super Bowl to become the coach of the New York Jets. The book Patriot Reign alleges the Patriots have cell phone records showing Parcells was in constant contact with the Jets during the week. Then-Patriots defensive coordinator (and now head coach) Bill Belichick is quoted as saying Parcells' plans to leave for the Jets were a distraction, [...] "Yeah, I'd say it was a little bit of a distraction all the way around. I can tell you first-hand, there was a lot of stuff going on prior to the game. I mean, him talking to other teams. He was trying to make up his mind about what he was going to do. Which, honestly, I felt [...] totally inappropriate. How many chances <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> play for the Super Bowl? Tell them to get back to you in a couple of days. I'm not saying it was disrespectful to me, but it was in terms of the overall commitment to the team." [...] Parcells even refused to travel back with the rest of the Patriots after the game, and was eventually hired by the rival Jets.|$|E
6000|$|... "How do you mean, forgotten?" [...] I said. [...] "Forgotten whether it's {{the twentieth}} or the twenty-first, or what? How near <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thomas!" [...] called Uncle John, {{turning in}} his seat; {{and at the}} summons Old Hucks came from the barn and {{approached}} them. [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Miss Thompson's place?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anna," [...] she moaned, [...] "I am a jealous, ungrateful woman. But oh, how weary I am! I know. If only--Anna, tell me," [...] {{she broke}} off suddenly, [...] "how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know Mr. Ennison?" ...|$|R
500|$|As {{a result}} of World War II in the 1940s, Asch and other social psychologists were {{interested}} in propaganda. They wondered: How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> people <b>to</b> believe what you want them <b>to</b> believe? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> people <b>to</b> believe they should sacrifice for the war effort? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to,</b> Dick?" [...] the Colonel {{asked when}} his nephew {{went down to}} meet him. [...] "I saw you close behind the hounds for a time, but you {{disappeared}} and nobody seemed to know {{what had become of}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{you may be}} sure. I {{am afraid}} that now you have taken the trouble to aid me in the matter, {{you will have to}} go through with it altogether. This is utterly out of my line; {{anything}} connected with poaching or stealing fruit, or drunken assaults, my experience as a county magistrate enables me to treat with something like confidence, but here I am altogether at sea and your experience as a barrister is of the greatest benefit to me. What time <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> your chambers in the morning?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] {{she cried}} passionately, [...] "I don't {{care what you}} think! I tell {{you that if you}} were really a man, if you had a man's heart in your body, you'd have sinned {{yourself}} before now--robbed some one, murdered them, torn the things that make life from the fate that refuses to give them. What is it they pay you," [...] she went on contemptuously, [...] "at that miserable art school of yours? Sixty pounds a year! How much <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> eat and drink out of that? What sort of clothes have you to wear? Are you content? Yet even you have been better off than I. You have always your chance. Your play may be accepted or your stories published. I haven't even had that forlorn hope. But even you, Philip, may wait too long. There are too many laws, nowadays, for life to be lived naturally. If I were a man, a man like you, I'd break them." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Dare, {{you look}} like a dead one," [...] she said. [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>get</b> shot, bayoneted, gassed, shell-shocked and all the rest? Did you go over the top? Did you kill any Germans? Gee! <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> ride in a war-plane? Come across, now, and tell me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{have had}} a lesson for once," [...] Mr. Cartwright said as he looked round, [...] "they won't attack my mill again in a hurry. I need not say, Sankey, how deeply I am obliged to you for your timely warning. How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] said Sam coldly, [...] "where I had got <b>to!</b> Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> and why? <b>You</b> poor, miserable worm," [...] {{he went on}} in a {{burst of}} generous indignation, [...] "what have you to say for yourself? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean by dashing away like that and killing my little entertainment?" ...|$|R
5000|$|At some {{concerts in}} Germany, Chris Martin asked the {{audience}} in German [...] "Wo geht es zum Bahnhof?" [...] ("How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the train station?"). This may be {{a reference to the}} U2 song [...] "Zoo Station".|$|E
5000|$|Carol Ward, {{professor}} of pathology and anatomical {{sciences at the}} University of Missouri, is also sceptical of the intentional burial explanation and asked, [...] "If it’s really that {{hard to get to}} the cave, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> that long dark cave carrying your dead grandmother?" ...|$|E
50|$|Kōwhaiwhai is an {{expression}} of the way our ancestors saw the world in their time. Their achievement, using positive and negative spaces, was to have the colours interact simultaneously - as opposed to how most people think now. Now we’re taught to see the positive space and not the space around it. It’s one of the simple conventions of kōwhaiwhai, but for me it’s achieving excellence through simplicity. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> that level? That’s what fires me up.|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> eat and drink, [...] Johnnie, Johnnie?" [...] Standing {{water as}} thick as ink, [...] Johnnie, my Johnnie, aha! [...] A bit o' beef that were three year stored, [...] A bit o' mutton as tough as a board, [...] And a fowl we killed with a sergeant's sword, [...] When the Widow give the party.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I cannot stay to {{tell you}} now. Moreover, your mind should be fixed upon immortal crowns, and not on earthly necklaces. I must be gone; nay, stay me not, I am already late. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> your knees and pray till your god-parents come to fetch you." ...|$|R
5000|$|How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> propose <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{it through}} the {{cooperation}} of Turkey where {{the men in the}} ranks get 23 centsa month the first year and 32 cents the second year, or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an American division and equip it and send it over to Turkey which would cost you 10 times as much? John Foster Dulles, U.S. Secretary of State, 1955 ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Artists {{came out}} of the woodwork," [...] visual artist, Garry Shepherd, told the ABC's Sounds Like Techno online {{documentary}} in 2002. [...] "Where else <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> play with a ready-made crowd and a huge sound system and lasers at your disposal?" [...] In the same documentary, fellow artist Robin Cooke agreed: [...] "These events were so big, eight to nine thousand people. This was too big for one or two artists to handle; it needed 20 artists to make the thing come together." ...|$|E
5000|$|Monty Entertainment also added: [...] "One of {{the things}} I love about D’Banj now is that he {{switched}} things up. If {{you listen to the}} songs he has released recently, you will notice that they are different from the D’banj we knew when he was still under Mo’Hits Records. D’Banj even displayed his vocal skills on this new track, and for a guy like him, it was not bad at all. Not only <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> enjoy this tune, the song actually sends out a message.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the release}} of Lost and Found in 2005, Chad Gray and Greg Tribbett formed the heavy metal {{supergroup}} Hellyeah. They released their self-titled album in 2007. The following year Mudvayne released their fourth album The New Game to lukewarm reviews. Chad Gray has said [...] "I love being in two bands. I really <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> explore both sides of yourself. I think everybody has this severed half. The kind that co-exists outside of your work. I was able to kind of climb into that skin." ...|$|E
6000|$|When Bertram Ingledew {{looked at}} him, Philip once more relented. The man's eye was so captivating. To say the truth, there was {{something}} taking about the mysterious stranger--a curious air of unconscious superiority--so that, the moment he came near, Philip felt himself fascinated. He only answered, therefore, in as polite a tone as he could easily muster, [...] "Why, how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know my name, or to trace me to my sister's?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's brain," [...] I said; [...] "pure brain! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> like that, Jeeves? I {{believe you}} must {{eat a lot}} of fish, or something. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> {{eat a lot of}} fish, Jeeves?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now a few {{strips of}} plaster,"--this was to Monsieur Teclier, whose face was cut a good deal--"and then <b>you</b> will <b>do,</b> till <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the town." ...|$|R
