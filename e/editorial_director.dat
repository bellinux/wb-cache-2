5|$|She {{went to work}} at Vogue {{later when}} Alex Liberman, <b>editorial</b> <b>director</b> for Condé Nast, {{publisher}} of Vogue, talked to Wintour about a position there in 1983. She eventually accepted after a bidding war that doubled her salary, becoming the magazine's first creative director, a position with vaguely defined responsibilities. Her changes to the magazine were often made without Mirabella's knowledge, causing friction among the staff. She began dating child psychiatrist David Shaffer, an older acquaintance from London. They married in 1984.|$|E

5|$|Bill Werde {{was named}} <b>editorial</b> <b>director</b> in 2008, and was {{followed}} by Janice Min in January 2014, who is also responsible for editorial content at The Hollywood Reporter. The magazine has since been making changes {{to make it more}} of a general interest music news source, as opposed to solely an industry trade. It started covering more celebrity, fashion, and gossip. Min hired Tony Gervino as the publication's editor, which was different than Billboard's historical appointments, in {{that he did not have}} a background in the music industry. Tony Gervino was appointed editor-in-chief in April 2014. An item on NPR covered a leaked version of Billboards annual survey, which it said had more gossip and focused on less professional topics than prior surveys. For example, it polled readers on a lawsuit pop-star Kesha filed against her producer alleging sexual abuse.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} appeared {{less frequently}} after 1964, when Julius Schwartz (who disliked the Joker) became {{editor of the}} Batman comics. The character risked becoming an obscure figure of the preceding era until this goofy prankster version of the character was adapted into the 1966 television series Batman, {{in which he was}} played by Cesar Romero. The show's popularity compelled Schwartz to keep the comics in a similar vein. As the show's popularity waned, however, so did that of the Batman comics. After the TV series ended in 1968, the increase in public visibility had not stopped the comic's sales decline; <b>editorial</b> <b>director</b> Carmine Infantino resolved to turn things around, moving stories away from schoolboy-friendly adventures. The Silver Age introduced several of the Joker's defining character traits: lethal joy buzzers, acid-squirting flowers, trick guns, and goofy, elaborate crimes.|$|E
