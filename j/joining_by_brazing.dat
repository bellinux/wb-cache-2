40|$|AbstractIn this paper, three joining {{methods are}} {{employed}} to join W-Cu alloy and Cu {{to investigate the}} effect of joining methods on the resistivity of the joint. The results show that W-Cu alloy is well bonding to the Cu substrate when joining by diffusion vacuum bonding and brazing in vacuum methods. Welding defects is apt to occur when <b>joining</b> <b>by</b> <b>brazing</b> in air. The lowest resistivity of the joint welded is obtained by vacuum diffusion bonding, which approximates to the W-Cu alloy while that for the joint brazed in air is the highest. Vacuum diffusion bonding method is the best choice when the demand of conductivity is vital while the mechanical reliability is not critical. Otherwise, brazing in vacuum is the prior option...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Diamond {{tools are}} {{increasingly}} gaining importance as cutting materials for various construction materials. The quality of synthetic diamonds, monocrystalline {{as well as}} polycrystalline or CVD-diamonds has been significantly improved over the last years. Integrating these cutting materials requires adequate joining technologies that produce sound joints without exposing the temperature sensitive diamond to too elevated temperatures. The paper highlights current developments in the joining of synthetic diamonds to steel. Owing to their covalent atomic bonding diamonds cannot easily be wetted and <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> employing conventional <b>brazing</b> alloys. Hence, active agents are needed to foster an interfacial reaction. Different active filler concepts are presented and discussed regarding their joint formation.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the applicability of microanalytical methods with high spatial resolution to the characterization of the composition and corrosion behavior of two bracket systems. Material and methods: The surfaces of six nickel-free brackets and six nickel-containing brackets were examined for signs of corrosion and qualitative surface analysis using an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA), prior to bonding to patient's tooth surfaces and four months after clinical use. The surfaces were characterized qualitatively by secondary electron (SE) images and back scattered electron (BSE) images in both compositional and topographical mode. Qualitative and quantitative wavelength-dispersive analyses were performed for different elements, and by utilizing qualitative analysis the relative concentration of selected elements was mapped two-dimensionally. The absolute concentration of the elements was determined in specially prepared brackets by quantitative analysis using pure element standards for calibration and calculating correction-factors (ZAF). Results: Clear differences were observed between the different bracket types. The nickel-containing stainless steel brackets consist of two separate pieces <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> a <b>brazing</b> alloy. Compositional analysis revealed two different alloy compositions, and reaction zones on both sides of the brazing alloy. The nickel-free bracket was a single piece with only slight variation in element concentration, but had a significantly rougher surface. After clinical use, no corrosive phenomena were detectable with the methods applied. Traces of intraoral wear at the contact areas between the bracket slot and the arch wire were verified. Conclusion: Electron probe microanalysis is a valuable tool for the characterization of element distribution and quantitative analysis for corrosion studies...|$|R

The {{influence of the}} brazing temperature and holding stage on the microstructure and hardness profile of the interface, {{as well as on}} the shear strength of the joint, were assessed. Brazing was performed in a high vacuum furnace at 850, 890 and 930 °C for 10 and 30 min. The reaction between the braze alloy and both materials led to the formation of a multilayered interface. The interfacial microstructure was analysed in a scanning electronic microscope (SEM) and the composition of each reaction layer was investigated by energy dispersive X-ray scans (EDS). The interfacial hardness profile was determined by a series of microhardness tests on each reaction layer. The mechanical strength of the joint was assessed from shear tests conducted at room temperature. Brazing at 850 °C with a 10 min holding stage produced stronger joints, with an average shear strength of more than 85 % of the glass-ceramic bulk strength. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{increase in}} already high specific performance of aero engines and growing optimization demands require further {{innovation in the}} fields of materials and design of structures to reach the primarily aerodynamic driven goals. In general, the improvement of materials on its own cannot guarantee success but rather the combination of different materials offers the potential for increased performance and additional functionality. For using different material properties, an adapted hybrid design is necessary. Within this design outstanding material characteristics should be addressed, whilst the lower performance properties must not be critical and provoke faults. By combining different materials within hybrid structures, the feasible increase in performance is accompanied with the challenges of handling a lot more parameters for optimization. Three examples are described in this paper, showing hybrid design approaches for aero engine structures. The design principles can be transferred to similar structures by using the shown basic mechanisms. The first example covers a hybrid ring structure used for simultaneous movement of stator vanes within an axial compressor. BLISK technology with high aerodynamic efficiency and low structural damping requires an accurate positioning of the stator vanes to avoid dynamic excitation in transient surroundings during a complete flight cycle. Additionally, the weight of the structure should be reduced compared to conventional in-service structures. A second example shows a hybrid fan blade. Here it is demonstrated how titanium can be combined with carbon fibre-reinforced plastics to create an airfoil. This concept can be implemented in generating stator vanes and rotor blades for aero engines. A special surface treatment leads to a non-aging jointbetween the two materials. The third example explains the basics for an alternative hybrid rotor design. Three titanium rotor segments are <b>joined</b> together <b>by</b> <b>brazing</b> under vacuum conditions. During the manufacturing process, the inner areas of the rotor are accessible which offers the opportunity to integrate cavities as well as fibre reinforcement...|$|R

40|$|At the D. V. Efremov Scientific Research Institute of Electrophysical Apparatus (SRIEA), {{elements}} of the ITER first wall (beryllium tiles and heat removal CuCrZr-bronze) are currently <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> ``fast'' <b>brazing</b> (heating with a rate of 150 K/min) using the method of passing a current through brazed samples. For this purpose, rapidly quenched brazing filler metal STEMET 1101 is used. The thermal cycle of brazing consists of a fast heating of the assembly to a temperature of 700 – 720 °C and a subsequent cooling (rate of 60 K/min). However at these temperatures, processes resulting {{to a loss of}} the tensile and shear strength of CuCrZr can occur. Therefore, reducing the brazing temperature is a very important task. Optimization of the composition of the Cu–Ni–Sn–P system filler metals and comparative tests of filler metals of various compositions have been carried out in this paper to reduce the brazing temperature of beryllium with CuCrZr. Alloys of the following compositions Cu– 6. 4 Ni– 9. 2 Sn– 6. 3 P (STEMET 1105) and Cu– 9. 1 Ni– 3. 6 Sn– 8. 0 P (STEMET 1101) were made in the form of rapidly quenched ribbons with a thickness of 50 µm and a width of 50 mm. They were used to perform furnace <b>brazing</b> <b>by</b> Joule heating (with a rate of 15 K/min) of beryllium with CuCrZr (Be/CuCrZr) at temperatures of 650, 700 and 750 °C for 15 min. Metallographic investigations of the zone of brazing and mechanical shear tests of joints before and after the heat treatment at 350 °C for 30 h have been conducted. It was found that the joints of Be/CuCrZr brazed at 650 °C using STEMET 1105 (τs= 230 MPa) and at 750 °C using STEMET 1101 (τs= 260 MPa) had the best shear strength properties. However, there is a significant decrease of the microhardness of CuCrZr from 1570 to 1140 MPa at 750 °C, which indicates a significant loss of its strength. The results obtained suggest that the brazing of beryllium with CuCrZr using STEMET 1105 at 650 – 700 °C will not adversely affect the CuCrZr...|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} demand for aluminum microchannel condensers in the HVAC 2 ̆ 6 R industry imposes new challenges on the design and manufacturing processes. An aluminum microchannel heat exchanger typically contains three major components: headers, microchannel tubes and multi-louvered fins. The parts are assembled and <b>joined</b> together <b>by</b> a <b>brazing</b> process. To ensure high thermal performance of the brazed product, microchannel heat exchanger designers must carefully consider manufacturing {{issues related to the}} brazing process during the design stage. For example, in addition to proper sizing of the header manifolds, it is essential to determine the optimal insertion length of the microchannel tube into the header during the header/tube assembly process. An oversized header diameter not only reduces heat exchanger compactness, but also leads to increased refrigerant charge. It further increases header wall thickness requirements due to increased hoop stress. Too short of an insertion length of the microchannel tube increases the risk of overflow of liquid filler metal into the microchannels during brazing and blockage of the refrigerant passages. On the other hand, small diameter header tubes and long insertion lengths of microchannel tube may contribute to a significant increase of refrigerant side pressure drop. This paper provides both experimental and analytical studies on the influences of header geometry and microchannel tube insertion length on the heat exchanger performance, such as refrigerant side pressure drop. Samples with various header/tube assembly design parameters are prepared and brazed using controlled atmosphere brazing (CAB) technology. Brazed samples are tested in a pressure drop measurement facility. Theoretical modeling of the brazed microchannel heat exchanger is performed and compared with the experimental results. This study provides important guidance and insights with respect to the design of microchannel heat exchangers under consideration of manufacturing issues...|$|R
