40|$|A selfconsistent {{analysis}} is developed {{to determine the}} radial electric field and loss cone boundary in Torsatron/Heliotron plasmas {{under the influence of}} non-classical ion losses such as the loss cone <b>loss</b> and charge <b>exchange</b> <b>loss</b> of fast ions with neutrals. Analysis is applied to the NBI heated plasmas in the Compact Helical System (CHS) device. Comparison is made between theoretical results and experimental observations. The increased ion particle losses caused by the orbit <b>loss</b> and charge <b>exchange</b> <b>loss</b> with neutrals make the radial electric field more negative than the value of purely neoclassical calculation. The partition of the injection energy among the shine through, direct orbit <b>loss,</b> change <b>exchange</b> <b>loss</b> and bulk heating is evaluated by using the selfconsistent electric field profile. On-going experiments in the CHS device are briefly introduced. ...|$|R
40|$|The radial {{electric}} field structure in helical system is discussed {{taking into account}} the effects of the orbit <b>loss</b> and charge <b>exchange</b> <b>loss</b> in addition to the neoclassical fluxes. Analysis is made for the CHS torsatron/heliotron, in which the radial {{electric field}} E_r was estimated experimentally. It was found that the fast ion orbit <b>loss</b> and charge <b>exchange</b> <b>loss</b> have strong influence on the profile of the radial electric field, particularly near the plasma periphery. The absolute value of E_r in the experiments is still more negative than the theoretical Prediction. ...|$|R

5000|$|... 2010 - For the 2010 year total net {{production}} was 56,974 boe/d, 67% higher than in 2009; Most of the increase came from growth at the Rubiales heavy oil field. [...] Although revenue was 173% higher {{in the first half}} of 2010 than {{in the first half of}} 2009 net income continued to be weighed down by depreciation, amortization and foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>losses</b> (though the company rebounded from a $65.9 million net loss in the first half of 2009).|$|E
40|$|A selfconsistent {{analysis}} is discussed {{to determine the}} radial electric field and loss cone boundary in torsatron/heliotron plasmas {{under the influence of}} nonclassical ion losses. Effects of the loss cone <b>loss,</b> charge <b>exchange</b> <b>loss</b> of fast ions with neutrals, and the bipolar part of anomalous loss are taken into account. Analysis is applied to the NBI heated plasma in the CHS device. Comparison is made between theoretical results and experimental observations. The increased ion particle losses by the orbit <b>loss</b> and charge <b>exchange</b> <b>loss</b> with neutrals make the radial electric field more negative than the value of purely neoclassical calculation. The partition of the injection energy among the shine through, direct orbit <b>loss,</b> charge <b>exchange</b> <b>loss</b> and bulk heating is estimated by using the self-consistent electric field profile. The power loss of fast ions caused by the orbit <b>loss</b> or charge <b>exchange</b> process is by a facter of several tens to hundred greater than the reduction of the energy loss of bulk ions through the enhancement of radial electric field. Comparison with W 7 -A experiment is made, and the differences are discussed. ...|$|R
50|$|A smartnumber is a {{new type}} of voice {{continuity}} number where instead of storing the telephone number in the local BT telephone exchange, it is instead stored in BT's voice continuity 'cloud'. Calls made to a smartnumber can be delivered to any handset anywhere in the UK or the world, thus protecting a company from loss of a telephone <b>exchange,</b> <b>loss</b> of the ISDN or SIP circuits connecting the company to the telephone <b>exchange,</b> <b>loss</b> of the customers PBX on their premises or denial of access to their business premises. Should any of these circumstances occur, the company can use a web-based portal to change the call routing to individual numbers or to large groups of telephone numbers at the same time.|$|R

50|$|During an {{unsuccessful}} censure debate on 27 September 1997, Democrat Suthep Thaugsuban accused Thaksin of profiting on insider {{information about the}} government's decision to float the baht. However, this accusation was not investigated during the subsequent Democrat or TRT governments. During 1997, Thaksin's flagship company, AIS, suffered 1.8 billion baht in foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>losses</b> and saw its debt more than double due to the devaluation. However, critics have alleged that Thaksin's businesses suffered much less from the devaluation than rival companies.|$|E
5000|$|After {{uncovering}} foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>losses</b> in its U.S. banking subsidiary, Allfirst Financial Inc., Allied Irish Bank in 2002 engaged Promontory {{to conduct}} an internal investigation. Promontory issued the [...] "Ludwig Report", on March 14, 2002. The report detailed how the trader John Rusnak hid losses of $691 million over five years. [...] The report concluded that Rusnak, who was fired {{for his role in}} the trading losses, received no active help from within or outside the bank. Promontory found that the internal control mechanisms and audits had been insufficient.|$|E

One version of the [...] "pegged with horizontal bands" [...] is E. Ray Canterbery's delayed peg. Fluctuations occur within a 2 percent band, sufficiently wide to allow some trade adjustments and considerable short-term capital flows, but narrow enough to avoid unusually large fluctuations. The wide bank {{is allowed to}} move in the case of large official foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>losses.</b> China's current [...] "floating band" [...] is essentially a delayed peg.|$|E

50|$|As the Receivership mainly holds bank assets valuated {{in foreign}} currencies, the {{repayment}} of claims is likewise {{expected to be}} conducted through partial repayments mainly in foreign currencies, equal to the available cash currency basket stemming from liquidated assets on the payment day. Because of the currency mix being more or less equal when comparing the Claims with the held Assets, the risk for currency <b>exchange</b> <b>losses</b> {{are expected to be}} relatively low for the receivership. The table below provides an overview of the currency composition of the first 3 partial repayments and how currency exchange rates were at the time compared to 22 April 2009.|$|E
50|$|With the {{production}} of sisal only 2-5% of the plant is utilized. The remaining bio material is used as fertilizer or thrown away. In Tanzania, the Katani Limited constructed the country's first Sisal waste bio gas power plant at Hale. The project helps provide energy for rural establishments and the government plans to encourage the practice to help increase the country's energy output and reduce foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>losses</b> from the purchase of fossil fuels. Currently, the plant produces 1 MW of electricity and organic fertilizers which help reduce the company's costs. The Katani limited plans to build 5 more of the plants in {{a joint venture with}} a Chinese company at their various estates.|$|E
5000|$|Combat is {{completely}} voluntary. Units are always at least doubled on defence (exception: German {{units in the}} first winter after their attack on Russia). Terrain, which {{has no effect on}} movement, triples units on defence, while fortresses (Maginot Line, Westwall, Gibraltar, Malta, Leningrad and Sevastopol) quadruple them. Each combat may result in the complete elimination of either side, or an exchange, or a compulsory counterattack, either at face value (i.e. ignoring terrain effects) or at odds dictated by the table. A 2:1 attack is almost certain to succeed (albeit with some risk of an exchange), with a (1 in 36) chance of an [...] "attacker eliminated" [...] - the dreaded roll of 4, followed by 6. An attack at odds of 3:1 or greater is guaranteed to succeed, the only uncertainty being whether or not the defender will be eliminated outright or inflict some <b>exchange</b> <b>losses.</b>|$|E

40|$|This 2001 Article IV Consultation {{highlights}} {{that after}} three consecutive years of generally favorable performance, {{the economy of}} the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYRM) suffered a setback in 2001 because of a six-month security crisis. Output declined markedly and new outlays on security operations and weak revenues contributed to a large expansionary fiscal swing. Owing to a deterioration of the external current account position, the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>loss</b> was heavy. However, the impact on reserves was cushioned by sizable privatization inflows in early 2001. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper reviews {{alternative}} {{definitions of}} the non-financialpublic sector deficit. Important points giving rise to different definitions are the problem of foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>losses,</b> the appropriateness of including net government lending {{to the private sector}} and the distinction between nominal and real deficits. The paper also introduces alternative definitions of quasi-fiscal deficit, and discusses the same issues in the context of these definitions. Foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>losses</b> and the distinction between nominal and real deficits are discussed in greater detail, since these issues are even more relevant {{in the case of the}} central bank. The authors also merge the accounts of the non-financial and financial public sector into a consolidated budget constraint. Then the analysis of fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits are illustrated through a detailed examination of some stylized cases. Finally, the authors provide a summary of major issues and some conclusions are derived from them.

40|$|Energetic protons in the {{radiation}} belt {{of the earth}} 2 ̆ 7 s magnetosphere show energy density enhancement associated with geomagnetic storms/substorms, which observation with Explorer 45 evidently revealed as a nose structure in the E-t spectrogram inside the plasmasphere. An attempt {{has been made to}} explain this by an injection model in which energetic protons are injected around a nightside geosynchronous orbit with their subsequent inward motions due to a convection electric field possibly driven by the solar wind and a corotation electric field. It is also important to include a loss mechanism in the model inside the plasmasphere since the protons decay due to charge <b>exchange</b> <b>loss</b> processes with geocoronal neutral hydrogen. The loss rate of protons depends on the hydrogen density and charge exchange cross section. In this study, the effect of the charge <b>exchange</b> <b>loss</b> is examined by computer simulation of energetic proton trajectories in the magnetosphere; the hydrogen density being obtained by the Chamberlain model and the charge exchange cross section being adopted from the latest approximate formula. It is concluded that loss processes play an essential role in the energy density distributions of protons in the near earth radiation belts, especially inside L of about 4...|$|R
