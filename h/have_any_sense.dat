5|$|Demerits: However, competencies, {{efficiency}} and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially {{when dealing with}} oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes {{feel that they are}} not part of the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they do not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E

Examples {{of analysis}} without a metric include measure theory (which describes size rather than distance) and functional analysis (which studies topological vector spaces that need not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of distance).|$|E

And he was always astounded when people testified that they had seen him in incriminating places, because Bundy did not believe people noticed each other. [...] "I don't know why everyone is out to get me", he complained to Lewis.

500|$|Forbidden Zone {{featured}} Bright's first work on film, and {{his only}} {{work as an}} actor (under the name [...] "Toshiro Baloney"). A {{founding member of the}} Mystic Knights, Bright later became a screenwriter and director in his own right. Bright's credits include Freeway, Ted Bundy, and Tiptoes. Bright and director Richard Elfman's only dispute during the screenwriting process was over a scene in which his character, Squeezit, was originally to have been beaten up for eight minutes and having the walls wiped with his blood. Another scene cut from the script would have had Squeezit being castrated. According to Bright, [...] "I didn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of limits or balance then, at the time, I... you know, I was just, didn't know what I was doing. I needed reining in." [...] During filming, Bright was sitting on the set in costume when a lighting stand fell onto his head, cracking his skull, and he had to be rushed to the hospital. When Bright returned to work the next day, he had a mild concussion and whiplash, but he continued with filming.|$|E
500|$|Actor James Anderson {{was cast}} as Oliver. Before {{assuming}} the role, he shadowed a real F1 doctor on ward rounds – an experience he found difficult. [...] "We were approaching beds {{in which people}} were waking up from heart attacks and coming around quite distressed sometimes. It was really difficult {{to be there with}} a patient. It's harder than you think and I got quite emotional." [...] Anderson underwent such extensive training with the programme's medical advisors that he jested in June2009, [...] "If I started medical training now, I could probably graduate as a doctor coming out of the show!" [...] The actor experienced [...] "an extended period of anxiety" [...] upon joining the series, and recalls: [...] "It took me about six months to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> {{of what was going on}} and then the second six months to feel comfortable [...] but only because it's such a well-oiled machine. You're coming in as a little cog, so you have to discover how to work in that and that takes a while." ...|$|E
500|$|Lindelof {{stated that}} [...] "When season five starts, you won't know when or where you are. [...] And {{the way we}} tell stories will be {{different}} too", and confirmed that the [...] "whooshing sound" [...] effect {{will continue to be}} used as the transition for the new storytelling device. [...] When asked if episodes continue to focus on specific and different characters, actor Jorge Garcia, who portrays Hurley Reyes, replied that [...] "It's not as clear cut as it's been in the past. We don't have the moments where someone stares off into space and then we cut to something that happened in their previous life. [...] They've gone in a slightly different direction as far as how they're telling the story and they're definitely trying to show what's going on with more people in every given episode." [...] The script included scenes with all the main characters, including Desmond in the ending, because the writers felt that after a long break the audience would like to see every character again. Like the previous three season openers, the opening scene was meant to make viewers [...] "not supposed to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of where and when we are". But while the other premieres had the teaser connecting into the main plot of the episode, the writers decided to put a scene that would only return in the fourteenth episode, [...] "The Variable". The time flashes were designed in a way that demonstrated both the castaways at the beach and John Locke in the jungle were [...] "skipping" [...] to the same time periods, and also to show that time travel was painful for the characters.|$|E

After about 40 years, however, Capp's interest in Abner waned, and this showed in the strip itself," [...] according to Don Markstein's Toonopedia. On November 13, 1977, Capp retired with an apology to his fans for the recently declining quality of the strip, which he said had been {{the best he could}} manage due to declining health. [...] "If you <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> of humor about your strip—and I had a sense of humor about mine—you knew that for three or four years Abner was wrong. Oh hell, it's like a fighter retiring. I stayed on longer than I should have," [...] he admitted, adding that he couldn't breathe anymore. [...] "When he retired Li'l Abner, newspapers ran expansive articles and television commentators talked about the passing of an era. People magazine ran a substantial feature, and even the comics-free New York Times devoted nearly a full page to the event," [...] wrote publisher Denis Kitchen.|$|E
