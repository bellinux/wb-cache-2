5|$|After the nine-month break, del Potro {{confirmed}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> his return at the 2010 PTT Thailand Open.

5|$|Lamason then {{instructed}} the group not {{to trust the}} SS, or provoke {{them in any way}} because as they had experienced on the train, the guards were unpredictable and trigger-happy. Also, they were not to explore the camp because of the chance of breaking unknown rules, but to stay together and keep as far away from the guards as possible. He further stated that acting on the group's behalf, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> further contact with the camp authorities for recognition of their rights.|$|E

[...] And again, of Monkhouse Lee, he said,--"Lee is a good fellow, an honest fellow, but he is without strength or ambition. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not <b>make</b> a fit partner {{for a man with}} a great enterprise. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not <b>make</b> a fit partner for me." ...|$|R
5|$|Paul {{began to}} {{assemble}} his campaign team, setting up campaign offices and hiring {{his campaign manager}} {{in the beginning of}} 2015, fueling speculation that he was preparing to enter the Presidential race.

5|$|Prince Sadruddin's {{interest}} in Islamic art was sparked {{in his youth}} by his paternal grandmother's library of Persian books, mystical texts and astrological treatises. While at Harvard in the 1950s, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> purchases in New York, and eventually began to acquire from dealers in Paris, Geneva and London. He would bid regularly at Sotheby's and Christie's auctions in Europe and North America. For advice, he looked to his friend Stuart Cary Welch, a noted historian of Islamic art at Harvard University.|$|E
5|$|The {{final stage}} of Prus's journey took him to Paris, where he was {{prevented}} by his agoraphobia from crossing the Seine River to visit the city's southern Left Bank. He was nevertheless pleased to find that his descriptions of Paris in The Doll {{had been on the}} mark (he had based them mainly on French-language publications). From Paris he hurried home to recuperate at Nałęczów from his journey, the last that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> abroad.|$|E
50|$|In September 1989, Mauricinho {{signed with}} RCD Espanyol, where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> only <b>make</b> four Segunda División {{appearances}} before the club released him in December 1989.|$|R

5|$|After a full {{pre-season}} {{he started}} to play well and hit six goals in 30 Third Division games during his time at Ashton Gate. Milne's form attracted attention elsewhere with Aberdeen among those interested, a move Milne favoured to be near his son and other family in Scotland. On being called into a meeting with manager, Joe Jordan, Milne was told by Jordan {{that he had no}} intention of letting him nor any of his other best players leave, but that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> an exception for Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|Brassey had {{considerable}} skill in choosing good men {{to work in}} this way and in delegating the work. Having taken on a contract at an agreed price <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> a suitable sum of money available to the agent to meet the costs. If the agent were able to fulfil the work {{at a lower cost}} he could keep the remainder of the money. If unforeseen problems arose and these were reasonable, Brassey would cover these additional costs. He used hundreds of such agents. At the peak of his career, for well over 20 years, Brassey was employing on average some 80,000 people in many countries in four continents.|$|E
5|$|By 1988, Searchlight {{reported}} that the party's membership had declined to around 1,000. Tyndall responded by trying to raise finances, calling for greater sales of their newspaper and increasing the price of membership by 50%. He also promised that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> the BNP the largest extreme-right group in the UK {{and that he would}} establish a professional headquarters for the party. This was achieved in 1989, as a party headquarters was opened in Welling, Southeast London, an area chosen because it was a recipient of significant 'white flight' from inner London. That year also witnessed the BNP become the most prominent force on the British far-right as the NF collapsed amid internal arguments and schisms.|$|E
50|$|In July 2006, Bwelle {{returned}} to the Greek top flight by signing with Ergotelis F.C., but <b>he</b> <b>would</b> only <b>make</b> five league appearances for the club.|$|R

5|$|De Grasse {{arrived at}} Cap-Français on 15 August. He {{immediately}} dispatched {{his response to}} Rochambeau's note, which was that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> for the Chesapeake. Taking on 3,200 troops, De Grasse sailed from Cap-Français with his entire fleet, 28 ships of the line. Sailing outside the normal shipping lanes to avoid notice, {{he arrived at the}} mouth of Chesapeake Bay on August 30, and disembarked the troops to assist in the land blockade of Cornwallis. Two British frigates that were supposed to be on patrol outside the bay were trapped inside the bay by de Grasse's arrival; this prevented the British in New York from learning the full strength of de Grasse's fleet until it was too late.|$|E
5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact, and {{he claimed}} with pride {{that he never}} left any book in his hands unread, and if he did, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> up for it by observing nature. However, his desire to read {{everything}} indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. Through his own written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that reading was basic {{in the formation of}} the self, and his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E
5|$|Fernández {{began the}} 2015 {{season on the}} 15-day {{disabled}} list but was later moved to the 60-day disabled list to continue recovery from Tommy John surgery. It was announced by the Marlins on June 15 that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> his season debut on July 2. In his debut, Fernández recorded six strikeouts in six innings. He also hit a home run. Fernández returned to the disabled list in August with a biceps strain in his pitching arm. He returned to the mound in September and set a major league record for consecutive wins at home by a single pitcher with his seventeenth such win on the 25th of that month.|$|E

5|$|Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed a {{bill that}} would have allowed the {{legislature}} to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; despite the fact that the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with the Senate. After the Senate rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed the Senate had its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else. When the Senate rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the governor and the Senate, after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. The Senate finally confirmed this choice.|$|E
5|$|In January 2010, Anderson {{signed a}} one-year deal with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> his debut {{to the company}} at the Genesis {{pay-per-view}} on January 17, 2010, working under the ring name Mr. Anderson. As a mystery opponent, he wrestled Abyss, whom he pinned after using brass knuckles, establishing himself as a heel in the process. Anderson made his Impact! debut on January 21, 2010. He would deliver a promo explaining why he came to TNA and disparaging Abyss before he was attacked by Abyss.|$|E
5|$|In late 1985, Jones {{announced}} his candidacy for lieutenant {{governor in the}} 1987 election, conceding that he sought the office because {{he would like to}} serve as governor in the future. He convincingly won in the Democratic primary against Paul E. Patton, who later became governor, and David L. Armstrong, the sitting Attorney General and later Mayor of Louisville. Wallace G. Wilkinson, winner of the Democratic gubernatorial primary, praised Jones and said that, if elected, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> Jones the head of a blue-ribbon economic development council. Wilkinson and Jones {{went on to win the}} general election; Jones defeated Republican nominee Lawrence R. Webster by a convincing vote of 517,811 to 186,321.|$|E
