40|$|In 2006 the General Assembly adopted {{resolution}} 61 / 105, {{based on}} a compromise proposal offered by <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishing</b> nations, which committed States and regional fisheries management organisations [RFMOs] to take specific measures to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems [VMEs] from the adverse impacts of bottom fisheries in the high seas and to ensure the longterm sustainability of <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks.</b> These measures included conducting impact assessments to determine whether significant adverse impacts[SAIs] to VMEs would occur, managing fisheries to prevent SAIs on VMEs, and closing areas {{of the high seas}} to bottom fishing where VMEs are known or likely to occur, unless regulations are in place to prevent SAIs and to manage sustainably <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks.</b> Based on a review in 2009 of the actions taken by States and RFMOS, the UNGA adoptedresolution 64 / 72 that reaffirmed resolution 61 / 105 and strengthened the call for action through committing States, inter alia, to ensure that vessels do not engage in bottom fishing until impact assessments have been carried out and to not authorise bottom fishing activities until the measures in resolutions 64 / 72 and 61 / 105 have been adopted andimplemented...|$|R
40|$|The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2002 {{adopted the}} first in a series of resolutions {{regarding}} the conservation of biodiversity in the deep sea. Prompted by seriousconcerns raised by scientists, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and numerous States,these resolutions progressively committed States to act both individually and through regional fishery management organizations (RFMOs) to either manage bottom fisheries in areas beyond national jurisdiction to prevent significant adverse impacts on deep-sea species, ecosystems and biodiversity or else prohibit bottom fishing from taking place. Ten years have passed since the adoption of resolution 61 / 105 in 2006, calling on States to take a set of specific actions to manage bottom fisheries in areas beyond national jurisdiction to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) from the adverse impacts of bottom fishing and ensure the sustainability of <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks.</b> Despite the considerable progress by some RFMOs, there remain significant gaps in the implementation of key elements and commitments in the resolutions.  The Deep Sea Conservation Coalition (DSCC)  has prepared this report to assist the UNGA in its review in 2016 and to address the following question: How effectively have the resolutions been implemented...|$|R
40|$|Size-based {{indicators}} are well {{established as a}} management tool in shelf seas as they respond to changes in fishing pressure and describe important aspects of community function. In the deep sea, however, vital rates are much slower and body size relationships vary with depth, making it less clear how size-based indicators can be applied and whether they are appropriate for detecting changes through time. The <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> of the North Atlantic underwent a period of exploitation followed by management and conservation action that relieved this pressure. We used data from a deep-water bottom trawl survey in the Rockall Trough, at depths of 300 – 2000 m, to test whether size-based indicators changed over a 16 -year period, during which fishing pressure decreased. We applied four indicators to these data: mean body length, mean maximum length, large fish indicator (LFI) and {{the slope of the}} biomass spectrum. Patterns were analysed within four different depth bands. The LFI and slope of the biomass spectrum showed positive change over time, suggesting recovery from fishing pressure. This response was generally most apparent in the shallowest depth band, where most fishing activity has been distributed. Values of the LFI were much higher overall than in shelf seas, so the same reference points cannot be applied to all marine ecosystems. These findings imply that size-based indicators can be usefully applied to the deep sea and that they potentially track changes in fishing pressure in the medium term...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the approach {{taken by the}} European Union to the management of <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks.</b> An extensive range of measures was adopted in 2002, and implementation began in 2003. The scheme, which is binding on EU <b>fishing</b> vessels targeting <b>deep-sea</b> species in the North-East Atlantic, encompasses both input and output controls. In southern Europe and in the Mediterranean, deep-sea fisheries tend to be artisanal in nature, {{and in some cases}} of considerable antiquity. In northern community waters deepwater fisheries began in the 1970 ’s. These diverse fisheries, in several regions create particular problems for fisheries managers. The approach taken by the European Union was to adopt catch restrictions, in the form of total allowable catches for a range of the key deepwater species in the ICES area. In addition, a capacity restriction has been imposed. This requires that vessels that want to land more than a very small amount of some specified deepwater species should hold a license issued by its flag state. The overall capacity (in kilowatts and in gross tonnes) of vessels that can receive licences is limited to recent levels. The capacity limitation scheme is accompanied by a requirement to implement a scientific observer scheme in order to improve the scientific data available for assessment purposes.

40|$|<b>Deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> {{consist of}} species that live at depths of greater than 400 metres. While being {{important}} for EU fisheries, this natural renewable resource is particularly vulnerable to over-fishing, as many deep sea species are slow-growing and commonly of low fecundity. Generally {{little is known about}} the biology of deep sea species, and there prevails a substantial lack of scientific data on deep-sea stocks. This constitutes a major impediment to management strategies underpinning sustainable and profitable deep sea fisheries. Europe’s deep-sea fisheries began in the 1970 ’s and were entirely unregulated. The fleet grew as rewards were high, but many species were rapidly depleted. It was only in 2003 that a management plan was brought into action. While some measures to better protect commercially exploited deep sea fish have been adopted, such as the limitation of fishing effort or total allowable catches, these have been insufficient to allow stocks to recover and there is a general consensus that most deep-water stocks remain below safe biological limits for exploitation. In a recent communication to the Council and the European Parliament, the European Commission has emphasized the need to improve our knowledge on deep sea fish species to move away from the current prevailing unsustainable exploitation. Ideally, this would be the development of a robust and practical approach to estimate the abundance of deep sea species to support stock assessments and reduce the uncertainty about the state and rebuilding rates of commercially exploited deep sea stocks. The current rapid technology development and concurrent steep drop in costs of large-scale genotyping offers major opportunities for fisheries management. This report explores whether the concept of genetic close-kin abundance estimation, recently applied to establish biomass estimates of Southern Bluefin Tuna, can be applied to fisheries management of deep sea fish species.

The amino acid sequences of actins are highly conserved across a variety of species. The actins from C. armatus and C. yaquinae have the specific substitutions Q 137 K/V 54 A and Q 137 K/L 67 P, respectively, relative to C. acrolepis, and are pressure tolerant to depths of at least 6000 m. At high pressure, we observed significant changes in the salt bridge patterns in <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> actins, and these changes are expected to stabilize ATP binding and subdomain arrangement. Salt bridges between ATP and K 137, formed in <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> actins, are expected to stabilize ATP binding even at high pressure. At high pressure, <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> actins also formed a greater total number of salt bridges than non-deep-sea fish actins owing to the formation of inter-helix/strand and inter-subdomain salt bridges.

40|$|The {{depletion}} of shallow-water <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> through overexploitation {{has led to}} increasing <b>fishing</b> pressure on <b>deep-sea</b> species. Poor knowledge of the biology of commercially valuable deep-water fish {{has led to the}} serial {{depletion of}} stocks of several species across the world. Data regarding the genetic structure of <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> populations is important in determining the impact of overfishing on the overall genetic variability of species and can be used to estimate the likelihood of recolonisation of damaged populations through immigration of individuals from distant localities. Here the genetic structure of the commercially fished deep-water species the blackspot sea bream, Pagellus bogaraveo is investigated in the northeastern Atlantic using partial DNA sequencing of mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt-b) and D-loop regions and genotyping of microsatellite loci. An absence of variation in cyt-b and low genetic variation in D-loop sequences potentially indicate that P. bogaraveo may have undergone a severe bottleneck in the past. Similar bottlenecks have been detected in other Atlantic species of fish and have possibly originated from the last glaciation. P. bogaraveo may have been particularly vulnerable to the effects of low temperature and a fall in sea level because stages of its life history occur in shallow water and coastal sites. However, there are other explanations of low genetic variability in populations of P. bogaraveo, such as a low population size and the impacts of fishing on population structure. Analysis of population structure using both D-loop and microsatellite analysis indicates low to moderate, but significant, genetic differentiation between populations at a regional level. This study supports studies on other <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> species that indicate that hydrographic or topographic barriers prevent dispersal of adults and/or larvae between populations at regional and oceanographic scales.

40|$|Many <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishes</b> have sensory adaptations {{for living}} at great depths with very limited light. While such adaptations are best {{known in the}} visual system, {{it is likely that}} there are also adaptations in the {{auditory}} system that enable <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishes</b> to use the "auditory scene. " However, there are few data on the inner ear of <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishes.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to add to those data. Since <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishes</b> are rarely taken alive, this study was done through comparative anatomical investigations. Three families were chosen from two major <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> fauna: benthopelagic and mesopelagic. In Antimora rostrata (family Moridae, deep-sea cods), the inner ear structure and its coupling to the swim bladder were analyzed and compared with similar systems found in shallow-water fishes. Part of the membrane labyrinth is thick and rigid. The elaborate structure of the saccular epithelium and the close contact between the ear and swim bladder suggests enhanced hearing sensitivity. In the family Melamphaidae (bigscales and ridgeheads), five species from three genera show broad interspecific variation in the saccular otolith shapes, including having a long otolithic "stalk" in two genera. The presence of this "stalk" corresponds with a gradual change in the saccular maculae. A special type of ciliary bundle on the saccule may have enhanced sensitivity to bundle displacements. Ears were compared between six species of Macrouridae (grenadiers and rattails) that live at different depths. The saccule/lagena size ratio seems to increase with depth, especially between a mesopelagic and a benthopelagic species in the genus Nezumia, in which the benthopelagic species has an enlarged saccule associated with sound production. These findings support the hypothesis that some <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishes</b> have evolved specializations for inner ear function. While it is not possible to test hearing in <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fishes,</b> the various adaptations found suggest that at least some such species have evolved specialized structures to enable them to use sound in the deep-sea.

40|$|The main {{component}} of muscle fiber is α-actin, which plays many {{important roles in}} cellular functions. Monomeric actin protein can polymerize into filament with ATP hydrolysis. The amino acid sequences of actins {{are known to be}} highly conserved in many species. <b>Deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> actins have the specific substitutions, Q 137 K/V 54 A or Q 137 K/L 67 P. Since only Q 137 K substitution is located near the active site, this residue is expected to contribute to the pressure tolerance. Although some experiments showed the effects of substitutions at high pressure, the detailed mechanism of pressure tolerance induced by substitutions is still unclear, especially in molecular level. Using the molecular dynamics simulations of various actins, I analyzed high pressure effects on actin structures and dynamics. In <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> actins, the number of salt bridges increases and several salt bridges specific to <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> actins are observed. The salt bridge between Lys- 137 and ATP in <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> actins stabilizes ATP binding at the active site under high pressure. Other deep-sea specific salt bridges mostly connect pairs of secondary structures and subdomains. The salt bridges which <b>deep-sea</b> <b>fish</b> have are suggested to be a key for the mechanism of the pressure tolerance. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2011 - 03 - 24; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(科学); 学位記番号: 修創域第 4071 号; 研究科・専攻: 新領域創成科学研究科情報生命科学専...|$|R
