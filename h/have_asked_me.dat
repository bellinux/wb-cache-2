25|$|Over the years, {{many people}} <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> how I run the Naval Reactors Program, {{so that they}} might find some benefit for their own work. I am always chagrined at the {{tendency}} of people to expect that I have a simple, easy gimmick that makes my program function. Any successful program functions as an integrated whole of many factors. Trying to select one aspect as the key one will not work. Each element depends on all the others.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2007, Hornish drove Penske's No. 27 Dodge Charger in an ARCA Re/Max Series race at Michigan International Speedway. Starting in {{the pole}} position, {{he led the}} first 29 laps of the race before being passed by {{eventual}} winner Erik Darnell and finishing second. After the race, he called the transition to stock cars a [...] "challenge": [...] "I'm a student at this, still trying {{to learn as much}} as I can. A lot of people <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> what the toughest transition is, coming over here from the IndyCars and doing these stock car races, and really it's the fact I don't get much practice time." ...|$|E
500|$|Barnes played {{carefully}} on the still suspect pitch the following day and {{late in the afternoon}} Bradman, lower in the order than usual due to a leg injury, joined Barnes with the score at 4/159. Over six and a half hours later, Bradman was out for 234. Barnes was dismissed just four balls later, also for 234, having batted for over ten hours. In his autobiography, Barnes stated that the coincidence of scores was intended. [...] "Lots of people <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> whether I deliberately threw my wicket away at 234. The answer is yes." [...] He confirmed to an interviewer many years later that [...] "it wouldn't be right for someone to make more runs than Sir Donald Bradman".|$|E

500|$|In 2010, Mouton {{became the}} first {{president}} of the FIA's Women & Motor Sport Commission. She stated that [...] "for many years people <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> why there have been no women following in my footsteps. I really hope the Commission can help answer that question and that we can attract and support women in all areas of our sport." [...] Having already headed a working group on the future of rallying, Mouton was appointed FIA's manager in the World Rally Championship in 2011. Mouton also serves in the nomination committee of the Rally Hall of Fame. In March 2012, she recused herself after becoming a candidate for nomination. Mouton was inducted into the Hall of Fame along with two-time world champion Carlos Sainz.|$|E
500|$|The {{subject of}} Matthews' {{possible}} candidacy was raised at an October dinner fundraiser for presidential candidate Barack Obama held by Robert Wolf, president of UBS's investment bank. Discussing the dinner later, Matthews told The New York Times, [...] "People <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> about it. I've {{never told anyone}} that I'm running." [...] On November 28, The Patriot-News of Harrisburg reported that Matthews met that week with Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman T.J. Rooney and Executive Director Mary Isenhour to discuss possibly running against Specter. Isenhour told the paper Matthews had not formed a campaign committee or begun raising money, {{and she did not}} believe he had yet come to a firm decision, adding, [...] "He's got a really good job with MSNBC. I think he's going to put some thought into it before he jumps in." [...] The same day as that Patriot-News report, the political blog FiveThirtyEight.com reported that Matthews had already met with potential campaign staff, something Matthews claimed was [...] "absolutely not true".|$|E

"The {{following}} {{day after the}} Alexandra Palace gig (where Steve walked off), I was back home and I {{got a call from}} Ronnie Lane who said, 'Me, Kenney and Mac would like to come round and see you.' I thought, Hello, what's all this about? Anyway, they all came round to my horrible little flat in Earls Court and asked me to join the Small Faces. All I could say was it's a bit late now. Why couldn't you <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> while we were in Paris? We'd all be in the same band together and Steve wouldn't have left." [...] – Peter Frampton.|$|E

2500|$|By {{later in}} December, Kennedy had mounted {{a concerted effort}} to gain support around the state, and had made several trips and {{appearances}} as well. [...] Kennedy's appointment was supported by Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, State Assemblyman Vito Lopez, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, former New York City Mayor Ed Koch and the New York Post editorial page. [...] She received criticism for not voting in a number of Democratic primaries and general elections since registering in 1988 in New York City and also for not providing details about her political views. Kennedy declined to make disclosures of her financial dealings or other personal matters, stating that she would not release the information publicly unless she was selected by Paterson, at which time she would be subject to the same background checks as all appointees. Kennedy acknowledged {{that she was going to}} have to prove herself: [...] "Going into politics is something people <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> about forever. When this opportunity came along, which was sort of unexpected, I thought, `Well, maybe now. How about now?' [...] work twice as hard as anybody else ... I am an unconventional choice ... We're starting to see there are many ways into public life and public service." ...|$|E
2500|$|I had {{a terrific}} {{friendship}} with Sheila Florance. In fact she acted in {{my very first}} film, and we always used to joke that I would make her a star. When I heard suddenly that she was dying of cancer I visited her immediately. There was no sentimentality or anything on her part—she was an incredible woman—but she said jokingly, 'There is still time to turn me into a star, but let's be quick.' I went home and spent three days and three nights writing the script and then with Barry Dickins and Sheila we did another draft. She was given eight weeks to live and so we made A Woman's Tale with this hanging over us. This motivated us, of course, but Sheila had a degree of greatness about her. She was a very powerful woman. It was an amazing challenge {{to make a film}} about life, in the face of death. To get the money of course was impossible and I had to pawn everything I had. People <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> how we did it but to some extent we were idiotically courageous in taking this risk. Sheila and I joked all the time. I would say to Sheila, [...] "Please don't die on me or you'll kill me". She would reply, [...] "Don't worry I'll be a good girl." ...|$|E
