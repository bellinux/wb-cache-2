One 1996 survey of two sites in Ratanakiri and one site in neighboring Mondulkiri recorded 44mammal species, 76bird species, and 9reptile species. A 2007 survey of Ratanakiri's Virachey National Park recorded 30 ant species, 19 katydid species, 37 fish species, 35 reptile species, 26 amphibian species, and 15 mammal species, including several species never before observed. Wildlife in Ratanakiri includes Asian elephants, gaur, and monkeys. Ratanakiri is an important site for the conservation of endangered birds, including the giant ibis and the greater adjutant. The province's forests contain a wide variety of flora; one half-hectare <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> identified 189 species of trees and 320 species of ground flora and saplings.|$|E

25|$|To perform artisanal logging, the logger {{needs to}} obtain permit {{from the local}} government. With {{approval}} by the community chief, loggers can obtain a permit; yet, they have to report the harvest to local forestry technicians. These local forestry offices are considered the appropriate entity for approving the logging permits while {{they do not have}} the capacity to conduct <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> and forest mapping. Since the forest code does not have comprehensive mechanism to stop such logging activities, loggers continue to purchase logging rights from the local community. Depending on the scale of the logging, the community would demand different types of payment from loggers. One community in the North Kivu area, they demanded the logger to give them a 4x4 truck and upgrade the public infrastructures, which are not well provided for by the local government. Although the logger did not accept the request, this illustrates why locals want artisanal logging to exist.|$|E

[...] Its goal was to introduce genetically superior seedling into the Sun Pass forest. In 1979, tree plantations were established to provide well adapted seedling for the Sun Pass area. [...] In 1978, the Klamath-Lake District developed a long-range plan that continues to help forest managers to balance a wide range public interests in the Sun Pass forest.|$|E

30|$|Managers {{of forest}} {{resources}} require {{detailed information about}} their crops for planning, management and <b>inventory</b> purposes. Traditionally, <b>forest</b> <b>inventories</b> {{have been carried out}} through collection of ground-based measurements describing relevant crop features such as stand density, height and volume. However, as these measurements are usually taken over a limited number of plots, and then extrapolated to entire stands, they do not account for spatial variation across stands.

40|$|The goal of {{reducing}} emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and {{the roles of}} conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD+) under UNFCCC has triggered a new discussion on forest resource assessments in these countries. The international process on measurement, reporting and verification of REDD+outcomes (REDD+MRV) expands the scope of <b>forest</b> <b>inventories</b> to include quantification of forest carbon stocks and their changes for results-based REDD+ payments. UNFCCC decisions also specify methods to be used, and actors to be involved. Although forest management in developing countries has clearly been influenced by international processes in the past, exactly how{{and to what extent}} REDD+MRV has affected institutional arrangements for forest assessments in developing countries remains unknown. Using as a theoretical framework Discursive-Institutionalism, a concept derived frompolitical science, this paper examines (1) the historical evolution of institutional arrangements for <b>forest</b> <b>inventories</b> in Peru; and (2) how and to what extent their development has been shaped by international processes on forests, and, more recently, specifically by REDD+MRV. The findings showthat the international REDD+MRV discussion has expanded the objectives of forest assessments in Peru, inspired the mobilization of new actors and resources, and spawned the development of new protocols for forest assessments. However, the ‘depth’ of these changes is not yet extensive, since the newrules for <b>forest</b> <b>inventories</b> have not yet been formally adopted, and the institutes envisaged to implement <b>forest</b> <b>inventories,</b> including measurement of carbon stocks and their changes, have not been established...|$|R

Some {{of the new}} types of remotely sensed data, such as data from laser scanners, have already become widely applied in <b>forest</b> <b>inventories</b> (e.g., Næsset 2002 b). A common application involves the development of models that are applied wall-to-wall over an area of interest (e.g., Næsset 2004), often for providing data for forest management. However, this type of data is increasingly applied also in connection with large-area forest surveys, such as national-level <b>forest</b> <b>inventories</b> (Tomppo et al. 2010, Asner et al. 2012).|$|R
30|$|Hybrid {{inference}} is {{a straightforward}} approach {{in cases where}} auxiliary data are not available wall-to-wall and such data are expensive to acquire. In such cases a sample of auxiliary data can be selected, upon which the auxiliary variable totals and means can be estimated and used together with model predictions that link the auxiliary variables with the target variable. The approach so far {{appears to have been}} applied only in a limited number of <b>forest</b> <b>inventories,</b> although implicitly it has been used {{for a long time in}} <b>forest</b> <b>inventories</b> where models (such as volume, biomass and growth models) have been applied based on data from forest plots (Ståhl et al. 2014).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Forest</b> <b>inventory</b> is the {{systematic}} {{collection of data}} and forest information for assessment or analysis. An estimate of the value and possible uses of timber {{is an important part}} of the broader information required to sustain ecosystems. When taking <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> the following are important things to measure and note: species, diameter at breast height (DBH), height, site quality, age, and defects. From the data collected one can calculate the number of trees per acre, the basal area, the volume of trees in an area, and the value of the timber. Inventories can be done for other reasons than just calculating the value. A forest can be cruised to visually assess timber and determine potential fire hazards and the risk of fire. [...] The results of this type of inventory can be used in preventative actions and also awareness. Wildlife surveys can be undertaken in conjunction with timber inventory to determine the number and type of wildlife within a forest. The aim of the statistical <b>forest</b> <b>inventory</b> is to provide comprehensive information about the state and dynamics of forests for strategic and management planning. Merely looking at the forest for assessment is called taxation.|$|E

Much ofour current understanding on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has come from temperate grassland experiments and research in forests, whereexperimentation is inherently difficult due to the large size and longevity of trees, has lagged behind. However, studies in forests have advanced inthe last decade, partly due to the availability of large-scale observational data, such as national <b>forest</b> <b>inventories.</b> Here, we review how forest inventorieshave promoted {{a better understanding of the}} effect of diversity in forest functioning.
