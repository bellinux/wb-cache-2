500|$|People {{began to}} be alarmed. Samuel Pepys, who had an {{important}} position at the Admiralty, stayed in London and provided a contemporary account of the plague through his diary. On 30 April he wrote: [...] "Great fears of the sickness <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> it being said that two or three houses are already shut up. God preserve us all!" [...] Another source {{of information on the}} time is a fictional account, A Journal of the Plague Year, which was [...] written by Daniel Defoe and published in 1722. He had been only six when the plague struck but made use of his family's recollections (his uncle was a saddler in East London and his father a butcher in Cripplegate), interviews with survivors and sight of such official records as were available.|$|E

"Sometimes {{she seems}} to me just like a querulous, vulgar, middle-aged woman in her talk; she repeats herself in the same scolding sort of way; and she's so eager to blame {{somebody}} besides Bartley for Bartley's wickedness that, when she can't punish herself, she punishes her father.

50|$|At the Riverfront is the Governor Nicholls Street Wharf. Just {{back from}} the wharf is the lower {{terminus}} of the Riverfront Streetcar line. Continuing inland, beyond a flood wall is the French Market and the old New Orleans Mint building, now a museum. Beyond a largely commercial section of Decatur Street which includes some of <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> better known music clubs and bars is the still largely residential section of the lower French Quarter.

6000|$|But {{she moaned}} on, {{standing}} rigid, {{her left hand}} on her breast, her eyes red, moist, frightened, fixed: [...] "We always played together, and I thought <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> we could be such good friends, with all the different new things to do together--why, I wanted {{us to go to}} Chinatown and theaters, and I would have been so glad to pay my share.

6000|$|... "Nothing {{can be more}} {{incredible}} to me than the spirit hypothesis," [...] I replied. [...] "But, then, everything is incredible in the last analysis. I am the more disposed {{to believe in the}} teleplastic theory, for the reason that I have recently had an opportunity to witness a particularly incredible thing: the materialization of a complete human form outside the cabinet and beside the psychic--a phenomenon which has a special bearing upon the matter of identity which we are discussing. The sitting took place in a small private house <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> The psychic in the case was a young business man who is careful not to advertise his power. For four years he has been holding secret developing circles whereto a few of his friends only are invited. I was present last Sunday, and shared in the marvels. The place of the séance was the parlor of his apartment, his young wife and little daughter being present. There was, in addition, an elderly lady, mother-in-law of the psychic, and a Polish student whom I will call Jacob. I am quite sure that no one else entered or left the room during the evening. Mrs. Pratt, the mother-in-law, occupied a seat between me and Jacob. The little girl sat at the window, and was under my eye all the time. The wife spent most of the evening at the piano on my right. The room was fairly dark, though the light of a far-away street lamp shone in at the window.|$|E
