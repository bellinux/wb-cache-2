Purpose This prospective study aims to identify predictors of voluntary non-remunerated whole blood (WB) donors becoming plasmapheresis donors. Methods Surveys {{were sent to}} WB donors who had recently (recent n[*]=[*] 1, 957) and not recently donated (distant n[*]=[*] 1, 012). Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) constructs (attitude, subjective norm, self-efficacy) were extended with moral norm, anticipatory regret, and <b>donor</b> <b>identity.</b> Intentions and objective plasmapheresis donation for 527 recent and 166 distant participants were assessed. Results Multi-group analysis revealed that the model was a good fit. Moral norm and self-efficacy were positively associated while role identity (suppressed by moral norm) was negatively associated with plasmapheresis intentions. Conclusions The extended TPB was useful in identifying factors that facilitate conversion from WB to plasmapheresis donation. A superordinate <b>donor</b> <b>identity</b> may be synonymous with WB donation and, for donors with a strong moral norm for plasmapheresis, may inhibit conversion...|$|E

40|$|With an {{empirical}} study in two nonprofit industries (a money-collecting and blood-collecting organization), the authors investigate how organizational identification and identity salience together function {{in relation to}} satisfaction, loyalty, and behavior. They develop and test a model that best represents relationships featuring donor-nonprofit identification and <b>donor</b> <b>identity</b> salience in existing satisfaction-loyalty studies. Overall, the study empirically confirms that donor-nonprofit identification and donor iden-tity salience are distinct constructs and that both have direct positive effects on loyalty, but not that much on donations. Within the money donation context, both identification constructs have stronger total effects on donor loyalty than donor satisfaction, whereas in the blood donation context, donor satisfaction has a stronger effect on loyalty. In testing the causal direction between donor-nonprofit identification and donor satisfaction, the authors also find that the path should be conceptualized from satisfac-tion to identification. The study contributes {{to the theory of}} organizational identification and identity salience by highlighting the advantages of taking a combined theoretical approach.

40|$|Introduction: This {{qualitative}} {{study was conducted}} to explore the motivations and experience of oocyte donors donating to women known to them. Methods: Three women who donated oocytes to a close relative were interviewed and data were analysed using an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis approach. Results: The two key elements noted were “motivations for donation” and “coping with the consequences of oocyte donation”. The motivation for donation was influenced by the familial bond that was strengthened by the donation process in some cases. The concept of altruistic oocyte donation stemmed from the narratives of giving the gift of motherhood and gaining a positive self-image and respect from others. Coping with the consequences of oocyte donation tests the <b>donor</b> <b>identity,</b> their wishes for a positive outcome, concerns regarding disclosure of biological motherhood and detachment from the egg and potential child. Discussion: Motivation is influenced by a combination of factors including the rewards of altruistic behaviour, the existence and potential strengthening of the relationship between donor and recipient, but possibly also, a sense of obligation and societal expectations. Oocyte donation can be variously viewed by donors as a unique way of reproductive empowerment or an example of acceding to subtle coercion and thus disempowerment. The study also highlights the clinical as well as ethical importance of providing support services for oocyte donors and recipients...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Anonymous oocyte {{donation}} {{and participation}} in organ and blood/tissue donation programmes were studied specifically among Irish fertility patients. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire measured patient perceptions of, {{and participation in}}, blood/organ/tissue donor programmes, and to record opinion on anonymous donor oocyte compensation. RESULTS: A total of 337 patents were sampled; 56. 7 % had no children. None had participated in a donor oocyte programme either as donor or recipient. At baseline, 19. 6 % had previous in vitro fertilisation experience, more than one-third (35. 9 %) had donated blood anonymously, 19. 9 % were organ/tissue donors and 52. 2 % indicated that anonymous oocyte donors should receive some compensation. We found patients with infertility for extended periods {{were more likely to}} view oocyte donation favourably, compared to those with infertility of shorter durations (p = 0. 022, by Krusksal-Wallis Rank Sum test). Average recommended compensation for anonymous oocyte donor was euro 2177 (range euro 200 -euro 9500), and most (77. 2 %) favoured confidential protections for recipient and <b>donor</b> <b>identity.</b> CONCLUSION: This is the first investigation of blood and organ/tissue donation features among fertility patients in Ireland; the rate of blood donation in this group was more than 10 times higher than in the general Irish population. Protection of anonymity for both donors and recipients was supported by most patients, even opponents of compensated anonymous donation. Further studies should clarify patient perceptions about oocyte donation as a function of involvement in organ/tissue procurement programmes and blood banks...|$|E

40|$|Premise of the study: Even though pollen {{deposition}} schedules {{may have}} profound {{effects on the}} evolutionary outcome of pollen competition, few studies have investigated such effects in relation to pistil traits such as delayed stigma receptivity that enhance pollen competition. In Collinsia heterophylla, a largely outcrossing species with delayed stigma receptivity, we performed a series of controlled crosses involving several donors to understand how timing of pollen deposition influences siring ability, paternal diversity, and offspring fitness. Methods: Pollen was applied to fully receptive stigmas either as mixtures or consecutively {{with or without a}} time lag to mimic cases with early or delayed stigma receptivity. We used a genetic marker to assess offspring paternity. Key results: As expected, siring ability was affected by application order in crosses without a time lag, providing a first-donor advantage for pollen arriving on unreceptive stigmas. However, because pollen <b>donor</b> <b>identity</b> influenced siring ability, delaying stigma receptivity may still favor pollen of high competitive ability. In crosses on fully receptive pistils with a time lag of 24 h, a surprisingly high proportion of seeds (12 - 47 %) were sired by pollen applied last. A novel finding was that pollen applied only once (as a mixture), mimicking delayed stigma receptivity, led to higher paternal diversity within progeny families, which was associated with increased seed production. Conclusions: Our results suggest fitness advantages of enhancing pollen competition by delaying stigma receptivity in C. heterophylla, particularly in relation to increased paternal diversity...|$|E
40|$|Background and ObjectivesShow {{behaviour}} after {{invitation to}} donate varies considerably across donors. More insight into this variation {{is important for}} blood banks in achieving stable stocks. This study examined individual factors determining intended show behaviour. Most importantly, however, {{this study is the}} first study to account for variation in donor behaviour across different collection sites. Materials and MethodsWe applied a multilevel approach to data from Donor InSight, including 11 889 donors from 257 fixed and mobile collection sites in the Netherlands. The aim of the multilevel models was to account for variance at two levels, that is donors and collection sites. We estimated the likelihood of showing after invitation based on individual predictors, including demographics, donation history and attitude. At the collection site level, we included satisfaction with the blood bank aggregated from individual responses by donors who donate at this site, opening hours and collection site type, that is fixed/mobile. ResultsMost importantly, show behaviour varied considerably across collection sites and depended on characteristics of these sites. Moreover, women, older and more experienced donors had higher odds of showing after invitation than men, younger and less experienced donors. Donors higher on warm glow, self-efficacy and <b>donor</b> <b>identity</b> more likely showed after an invitation. Higher aggregate satisfaction and donating at fixed collection sites increased the odds of show. ConclusionIn addition to individual factors, collection site characteristics are important in explaining variation in donor show behaviour, thus presenting clues for blood bank policies and interventions to improve donor sho...|$|E
40|$|Background: Sexual {{conflict}} theory predicts sexually antagonistic coevolution {{of reproductive}} traits driven by conflicting evolutionary interests of two reproducing individuals. Most {{studies of the}} evolutionary consequences of sexual conflicts have, however, to date collectively investigated only a few species. In this study we used the annual herb Collinsia heterophylla to experimentally test the existence and evolutionary consequences of a potential sexual conflict over onset of stigma receptivity. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted crosses within and between four greenhouse-grown populations originating from two regions. Our experimental setup allowed us to investigate male-female interactions at three levels of geographic distances between interacting individuals. Both recipient and pollen <b>donor</b> <b>identity</b> affected onset of stigma receptivity within populations, confirming previous results that some pollen donors can induce stigma receptivity. We also found that donors were generally better at inducing stigma receptivity following pollen deposition on stigmas of recipients from another population than their own, especially within a region. On the other hand, we found that donors did worse at inducing stigma receptivity in crosses between regions. Interestingly, recipient costs in terms of lowered seed number after early fertilisation followed the same pattern: the cost was apparent only if the pollen donor belonged to the same region as the recipient. Conclusion/Significance: Our results indicate that recipients are released from the cost of interacting with local pollen donors when crossed with donors from a more distant location, a pattern consistent {{with a history of}} sexually antagonistic coevolution within populations. Accordingly, sexual conflicts may have important evolutionary consequences also in plants...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} years, {{a growing number}} of {{countries}} have legislated open-identity donation, in which donor-conceived offspring are given access to the <b>donor's</b> <b>identity</b> once the child has reached maturity. It is held that <b>donor</b> anonymity creates <b>identity</b> problems for such children similar to the "genealogical bewilderment" described within the adoption context. The study of the social and psychological effects of open-identity donation is still very much in its infancy, but what has been left unquestioned is whether (and to what extent) offering access to the donor's name and address is an adequate response to such effects. This study has two goals: First, we aim to provide a systematic review of the reasons why donor-conceived (DC) offspring want to know the identity of their sperm donor. Second, we examine to what extent the provision of donor-identifying information can satisfy the reasons mentioned. The most important motivations appear to be: (1) to avoid medical risks and consanguineous relationships; (2) to satisfy curiosity; (3) {{to learn more about the}} self or to complete one's identity; (4) to learn more about what kind of person the donor is (biographical information, why he donated, etc.); (5) to form a relationship with the donor and/or his family; and (6) to learn about one's ancestry/genealogy. Our analysis shows that for nearly all of these reasons access to the <b>donor's</b> <b>identity</b> is not necessary. In those cases where it is, moreover, donor identification is not sufficient. What is really needed is (extended) contact with the donor, rather than the mere provision of his name...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Donor {{retention}} poses {{a significant}} problem to blood collection agencies around the world. Previous research using an augmented Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) approach has demonstrated that attitude, subjective norm, self-efficacy, moral norm, anticipated regret, donation anxiety from prior blood donations and self-identity as a blood donor predicts experienced donors’ intentions and that intentions, self-efficacy, moral norm, and anticipated regret may impact upon people’s actual blood donation behavior [...] STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Established blood donors (N = 263) completed questionnaires assessing standard TPB constructs, anticipated regret, moral norm, donation anxiety, and self-identity as a blood donor. Three months later, a second questionnaire assessing blood donation behavior in the intervening three months was mailed and returned by 182 donors [...] RESULTS: Using structural equation modeling, the final augmented TPB model provided {{an excellent fit to}} the data and included a direct path from intention to behavior and indirect paths to behavior through intention for attitude, self-efficacy and anticipated regret.

40|$|Objective: To measure Irish {{opinion on}} a range of {{assisted}} human reproduction (AHR) treatments. Methods: A nationally representative sample of Irish adults (n= 1, 003) were anonymously sampled by telephone survey. Results: Most participants (77 %) agreed that any fertility services offered internationally should also be available in Ireland, although only a small minority of the general Irish population had personal familiarity with AHR or infertility. This sample finds substantial agreement (63 %) that the Government of Ireland should introduce legislation covering AHR. The range of support for gamete donation in Ireland ranged from 53 % to 83 %, depending on how donor privacy and disclosure policies are presented. For example, donation where the donor agrees to be con­tacted by the child born following donation, and anonymous donation where donor privacy is completely protected by law were supported by 68 % and 66 %, respectively. The least popular (53 %) donor gamete treatment type appeared to be donation where the donor consents {{to be involved in the}} future life of any child born as a result of donor fertility treatment. Respondents in social class ABC 1 (58 %), age 18 to 24 (62 %), age 25 to 34 (60 %), or without children (61 %) were more likely to favour this donor treatment policy in our sample. Conclusion: This is the first nationwide assessment of Irish public opinion on the advanced reproductive technologies since 2005. Access to a wide range of AHR treatment was supported by all subgroups studied. Public opinion concerning specific types of AHR treatment varied, yet general support for the need for national AHR legislation was reported by 63 % of this national sample. Contemporary views on AHR remain largely consistent with the Commission for Assisted Human Reproduction recommendations from 2005, although further research is needed to clarify exactly how popular opinion on these issues has changed. It appears that legislation allowing for the full range of donation options (and not mandating disclosure of <b>donor</b> <b>identity</b> at a stipulated age) would better align with current Irish public opinion...|$|E
40|$|Embryo {{donation}} (ED) is {{the donation}} {{by a couple}} who have surplus embryos following in vitro fertilisation to another infertile couple or person. The aim {{of this research was}} to address the paucity of knowledge on how ED is understood and experienced by donors and recipients. The research, the first on ED in New Zealand, is particularly relevant due to the newness of ED in the country and the unique guidelines: Registration of <b>donor</b> <b>identity,</b> mandatory individual and joint counselling for donors and recipients, and case-by-case application to an ethics committee. A discursive analytic approach was adopted, drawing on elements of both discursive psychology and Foucauldian discourse analysis. This took into account the potential influence of extra-discursive factors including embodiment, personal-social biographies and material conditions. Analysis focused on identifying discourses available in New Zealand society and how individuals invested in these discourses, and the implications for donor and recipient experiences and the resulting kinship structures. To facilitate a comprehensive and holistic understanding, the analysis was conducted across a range of sites: The academic literature, New Zealand’s legislative frameworks, policy guidelines, and ethics committee applications and decision-making. Further, interviews were conducted with 9 ED counsellors, 22 donors (10 couples, 2 individuals) and 15 recipients (5 couples, 5 individuals). A central discourse identified was the genetic discourse. Genetic connections were constructed as bestowing immutable kinship ties between donors and offspring. Donors constructed the children as still partly theirs, making ED a difficult choice, and conveying responsibility for the child’s welfare. Recipients constructed knowledge about genetic background as significant for their child’s identity and health. Disclosure of donor conception and access to the donors was thus assumed as a necessary, albeit challenging, part of being a parent through ED. Donors and recipients managed the significance of genetics through drawing on a number of further discourses: An adoption discourse (constructing ED as adoption, offering a familiar framework for this form of family-building, and making transparent rights and responsibilities), a gestational discourse (valuing the role of gestation in attachment), gifting and reciprocal exchange discourses (constructing the donation as a gift from donors to recipients, versus a mutually beneficial practice) and a discourse of ED as building extended families. The latter discourse enabled donors to maintain an interest as extended family, allowed recipients to assume parental authority but accommodate and manage the role of donors, and recognised sibling relationships. Donors and recipients were able to strategically appropriate genetic, gestational, and social elements of reproduction and parenting in a way that did not destabilise family relationships and boundaries. These new kinship forms were constructed as complex and novel however, creating anxiety and ambivalence amongst donors, recipients, and counsellors. Recommendations suggested for ED policy and practice include strategies to assist donor offspring to gain greater awareness and access to information on their genetic background, and the development of longer-term support structures to assist in the promotion of positive long-term outcomes for all parties involved in ED...|$|E

40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a fatal {{neurodegenerative disease}} of the motor system. Although ALS has been extensively studied in post-mortem patient samples and animal models, there are currently no very effective treatments {{and there is no}} cure. One reason for the lack of treatment options in ALS may stem from the inaccessibility of living human motor neurons for use in disease research and subsequent therapeutic target validation. Recent developments in the field of stem cell biology can potentially provide access to living human motor neurons from individual ALS patients. It is now possible to derive induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) from the somatic tissues of ALS patients and then to differentiate these iPS cells into motor neurons with the precise genetic makeup of the donor patient (iPS-MNs). Before iPS-MNs can be put to productive use, however, the iPS system as a whole must be validated as a reliable source of motor neurons with characteristics that closely resemble their endogenous or hES-derived counterparts. This thesis will first address a series of issues relating to the validation of iPS cells as a reliable source of motor neurons a then move on to expression profiling studies aimed at identifying a transcriptional signature of ALS in iPS-MNs. I will first describe a collaborative study aimed at determining whether or not iPS cells are as useful as ES cells for the production of motor neurons. By comparing motor neuron differentiation efficiency across a panel of 6 ES lines and 16 iPS lines, we demonstrated that iPS cells are equally capable of producing electrophysiologically active motor neurons as ES cells. Moreover, both ALS and control iPS lines produce motor neurons with equal efficiency, suggesting that iPS cells will be useful in the production of ALS iPS-MNs for disease research. In addition, our results identify some of the variables that contribute to differentiation efficiency, including <b>donor</b> <b>identity</b> and individual iPS/ES line identity. The following section will serve to provide a deeper molecular and electrophysiological understanding of human stem cell-derived motor neurons. I first generated expression profiles from purified hES-MNs to identify potential motor neuron-specific surface markers as well as maturational changes occurring in motor neurons in vitro. Using calcium imaging techniques, I then demonstrated that iPS-MNs behave functionally similarly to ES-MNs and described culture-wide rhythmic depolarizations that are likely influencing multiple properties of iPS-MNs. After characterizing the iPS-MN culture system, I made a first attempt at defining the transcriptional phenotypes of ALS in iPS-MNs. This work relied on the use of a motor neuron-specific lentiviral reporter that I developed to isolate and transcriptionally profile iPS-MNs from two control iPS lines and four ALS iPS lines. I show evidence of significant transcriptional differences between motor neurons isolated from ALS lines and those from control patients. These differences may in the future help to define ALS-specific phenotypes. Lastly, I conducted a meta-analysis comparing transcriptional changes in ALS iPS-MNs to those in existing models of ALS and identified some common stress-related features of ALS in iPS-MNs. In order to form new hypotheses about what sorts of individual patient-specific phenotypes may be present in iPS-MNs, I will then utilize published expression profiles from post-mortem ALS patient motor neurons to identify a previously-overlooked class of genes that exhibit expression levels highly correlated with individual age at ALS onset. This group of 43 onset-correlated genes contains many members with known or hypothesized relationships to neurodegenerative disease. I discuss how onset-correlated genes may function as disease-modifiers or biomarkers and design experiments to investigate these possibilities. Taken together, the work in this thesis will lay the foundations for developing a human iPS-based model of ALS and point toward numerous avenues of future investigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{worldwide}} organ shortage occurs despite people’s positive {{organ donation}} attitudes. The discrepancy between attitudes and behaviour {{is evident in}} Australia particularly, with widespread public support for organ donation but low donation and communication rates. This problem is compounded further by the paucity of theoretically based research to improve our understanding of people’s organ donation decisions. This program of research contributes to our knowledge of individual decision making processes for three aspects of organ donation: (1) posthumous (upon death) donation, (2) living donation (to a known and unknown recipient), and (3) providing consent for donation by communicating donation wishes on an organ donor consent register (registering) and discussing the donation decision with significant others (discussing). The research program used extended versions of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and the Prototype/Willingness Model (PWM), incorporating additional influences (moral norm, self-identity, organ recipient prototypes), to explicate the relationship between people’s positive attitudes and low rates of organ donation behaviours. 	Adopting the TPB and PWM (and their extensions) as a theoretical basis overcomes several key limitations of the extant organ donation literature including the often atheoretical nature of organ donation research, thefocus on individual difference factors to construct organ donor profiles and the omission of important psychosocial influences (e. g., control perceptions, moral values) that may impact on people’s decision-making in this context. In addition, {{the use of the}} TPB and PWM adds further {{to our understanding of the}} decision making process for communicating organ donation wishes. Specifically, the extent to which people’s registering and discussing decisions may be explained by a reasoned and/or a reactive decision making pathway is examined (Stage 3) with the novel application of the TPB augmented with the social reaction pathway in the PWM. 	This program of research was conducted in three discrete stages: a qualitative stage (Stage 1), a quantitative stage with extended models (Stage 2), and a quantitative stage with augmented models (Stage 3). The findings of the research program are reported in nine papers which are presented according to the three aspects of organ donation examined (posthumous donation, living donation, and providing consent for donation by registering or discussing the donation preference). 	 Stage One of the research program comprised qualitative focus groups/interviews with university students and community members (N = 54) (Papers 1 and 2). Drawing broadly on the TPB framework (Paper 1), content analysed responses revealed people’s commonly held beliefs about the advantages and disadvantages (e. g., prolonging/saving life), important people or groups (e. g., family), and barriers and motivators (e. g., a family’s objection to donation), related to living and posthumous organ donation. Guided by a PWM perspective, Paper Two identified people’s commonly held perceptions of organ donors (e. g., altruistic and giving), non-donors (e. g., self-absorbed and unaware), and transplant recipients (e. g., unfortunate, and in some cases responsible/blameworthy for their predicament). 	Stage Two encompassed quantitative examinations of people’s decision makingfor living (Papers 3 and 4) and posthumous (Paper 5) organ donation, and for registering and discussing donation wishes (Papers 6 to 8) to test extensions to both the TPB and PWM. Comparisons of health students’ (N = 487) motivations and willingness for living related and anonymous donation (Paper 3) revealed that a person’s <b>donor</b> <b>identity,</b> attitude, past blood donation, and knowing a posthumous donor were four common determinants of willingness, with the results highlighting students’ identification as a living donor as an important motive. 	An extended PWM is presented in Papers Four and Five. University students’ (N = 284) willingness for living related and anonymous donation was tested in Paper Four with attitude, subjective norm, donor prototype similarity, and moral norm (but not donor prototype favourability) predicting students’ willingness to donate organs in both living situations. Students’ and community members’ (N = 471) posthumous organ donation willingness was assessed in Paper Five with attitude, subjective norm, past behaviour, moral norm, self-identity, and prior blood donation all significantly directly predicting posthumous donation willingness, with only an indirect role for organ donor prototype evaluations. 	The results of two studies examining people’s decisions to register and/or discuss their organ donation wishes are reported in Paper Six. People’s (N = 24) commonly held beliefs about communicating their organ donation wishes were explored initially in a TPB based qualitative elicitation study. The TPB belief determinants of intentions to register and discuss the donation preference were then assessed for people who had not previously communicated their donation wishes (N = 123). Behavioural and normative beliefs were important determinants of registering and discussing intentions; however, control beliefs influenced people’s registering intentions only. 	Paper Seven represented the first empirical test of the role of organ transplant recipient prototypes (i. e., perceptions of organ transplant recipients) in people’s (N = 465) decisions to register consent for organ donation. Two factors, Substance Use and Responsibility, were identified and Responsibility predicted people’s organ donor registration status. Results demonstrated that unregistered respondents were the most likely to evaluate transplant recipients negatively. 	Paper Eight established the role of organ donor prototype evaluations, within an extended TPB model, in predicting students’ and community members’ registering (n = 359) and discussing (n = 282) decisions. Results supported the utility of an extended TPB and suggested a role for donor prototype evaluations in predicting people’s discussing intentions only. Strong intentions to discuss donation wishes increased the likelihood that respondents reported discussing their decision 1 -month later. 	Stage Three of the research program comprised an examination of augmented models (Paper 9). A test of the TPB augmented with elements from the social reaction pathway in the PWM, and extensions to these models was conducted to explore whether people’s registering (N = 339) and discussing (N = 315) decisions are explained via a reasoned (intention) and/or social reaction (willingness) pathway. Results suggested that people’s decisions to communicate their organ donation wishes may be better explained via the reasoned pathway, particularly for registering consent; however, discussing also involves reactive elements. 	Overall, the current research program represents an important step toward clarifying the relationship between people’s positive organ donation attitudes but low rates of organ donation and communication behaviours. Support has been demonstrated for the use of extensions to two complementary theories, the TPB and PWM, which can inform future research aiming to explicate further the organ donation attitude-behaviour relationship. The focus on a range of organ donation behaviours enables the identification of key targets for future interventions encouraging people’s posthumous and living donation decisions, and communication of their organ donation preference...|$|E

Because of the lethargy and benign neglect of the medical profession itself in policing this area, the courts will be forced to impose new and higher standards of care and responsibility, thereby tightening the laws of malpractice. Additional clarifying legislation will also have to be enacted creating a presumption at law of legitimacy for the issue born of consensual AID and thereby establishing both the legal rights and duties of the consenting husband. Donor liability should be scrupulously avoided. In cases where, for medical reasons, the <b>identity</b> of the <b>donor</b> is required, an in camera study of the matter should be conducted by a court and, where appropriate, a geneticist.

40|$|During recent decades, {{the third}} person {{intervention}} in human artificial insemination has created new hopes for infertile couples. However these new progresses have propounded new ethical and legal concerns for families. One of them is confidentiality regarding gamete <b>donor's</b> <b>identity,</b> and its disclosure to the future child and others. Of course, negligence to this ethical issue would produce a big barrier for efficient health care services. "nFor compiling this article we searched different websites including Pubmed, Ovid, Elsevier, Google and etc and the resulting articles were investigated carefully. "nIn this article, the history of gamete donation in different countries is reviewed initially and the mentioned reasons for anonymity with that of disclosure are compared. "nBecause of the different cultures and values of various societies, it is not justifiable to propose a unique method regarding this issue; however, {{there have to be}} clear rules in this regard, in each country. In order to facilitate this process, pretreatment counseling courses should be established to explain different aspects of this issue for the recipients...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{investigated}} the donor concept of children who were born by means of donor insemination (DI), and their lesbian parents. Methods: A total of 41 children aged between 7 and 17 years, and 45 parents, {{took part in the}} follow-up study. In-depth topic interviews were used to reconstruct how DI children and their mothers perceived the donor. Data were collected about the birth story, about children's conversations with their mothers concerning donor characteristics and about children's and parents' attitudes towards the status of the donor. Results: 54 % of these children preferred donor anonymity at this point in their life, whereas 46 % {{wanted to know more about}} the donor. The majority of the latter group would have liked to know the <b>donor's</b> <b>identity,</b> with boys outnumbering girls. The remaining children of this group were content with non-identifying information. Children wanted to know more about the donors whereas the majority of the mothers preferred the donor to remain anonymous. Conclusions: Our results suggest that among DI children in general and among members of the same family, unit opinions differ on the status of the donor. A flexible system offering different types of donors seems to be necessary in order to meet the needs of each family. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Mid-twentieth century {{technical}} examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms {{may have been}} painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps {{as early as the}} 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges. From this Dhanens theorises the piece was commissioned as a wedding gift for the couple. Documents show weavers in Wervik paid taxes to Catherine Rapondi and in September 1434, when Michele Burlamacchi was tax collector in that town, van Eyck received a stipend funded by local tax receipts, suggesting a connection. Dhanens admits the <b>donor's</b> <b>identity</b> is lost, but she says of the piece that [...] "{{it could have been a}} gift from the husband to the wife, a pledge of his affection during his absences; or it could have been a gift from the wife to the husband, by way of protection on his travels." ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the legal status}} of so-called contracts for anonymity between fertility clinics and donors of gametes that were made in the period before legislation authorising disclosure. It notes that while clinics frequently cite the existence of these "contracts" to argue against retrospective legislation authorising disclosure of the <b>donor's</b> <b>identity,</b> they may be nothing more than one-sided statements of informed consent. However, the article notes that even if an agreement between a donor and a clinic is not contractual, it does not follow that a person conceived through assisted reproductive technology has any right of access to the <b>identity</b> of the <b>donor.</b> The writer {{has not been able to}} locate examples of written promises by the clinics promising anonymity. There are written promises by the donors not to seek the identity of the recipients. These promises do not bind the resulting offspring nor do they appear to be supported by consideration. The article suggests that the basis for any individual donor to restrain a clinic from revealing their identity may be found in promissory estoppel. Nevertheless, there is no real issue in Australia concerning clinics revealing these details absent legislative authority. The issue is whether parliaments will legislate to authorise the disclosure. The article notes that it would be rare for parliaments to legislate to overturn existing legal contracts but suggests that the contract argument may not be as strong as has been thought...|$|R

That the frames are so richly decorated with Latin inscriptions indicates that the <b>donor,</b> whose <b>identity</b> is lost, was highly educated and cultured.

In this work, damaged coats of arms on the borders of the interior wings have been identified with the Giustiniani of Genoa– an influential albergo active from 1362– who established trade links with Bruges as early as the mid-14th century.|$|R
40|$|Current {{international}} policy {{trends in the}} field of medically assisted conception are moving towards increased openness of information regarding the nature of conception where donated gametes are involved. In the case of donor insemination this means that the donor is no longer anonymous, offspring have the right to access information about the <b>donor's</b> <b>identity,</b> and parents are encouraged to tell children the nature of their donor-assisted conception. Until recently, however, the practice of donor insemination has tended to create the conditions for ignoring, or erasing, the existence of the donor as the provider of the gametes. Changing policy creates numerous challenges to this erasure, and to traditional conceptualisations of the father. This research is based on analysis of the narratives of a group of 41 New Zealand couples who conceived children with the assistance of donor insemination 15 - 18 years prior. This article focuses on their talk about the donor. The parents' negation of the donor supports the normative formation of 'family', and is in turn supported by an instrumental and de-personalising discourse in relation to the donor. A tension is created within the parents' talk whereby donors are negated and yet simultaneously appear as persons. We explore this discursive construction, suggesting that a new framework for thinking about donated gametes {{and the role of the}} donor is influencing parents' narrations and understandings of family. We discuss these influences and examine their implications, particularly with respect to a separation of the bio-genetic from the social-environmental.

40|$|See {{attached}} document, below, {{for international}} dissemination and impact). Twelve month {{collaboration with the}} Hunterian, in which the key research question was if the practice of displaying anonymised human organs as objects disembodied from their subjective narrative context could be re-considered and re-contextualised through contemporary arts practice. Human body parts displayed in anatomy collections are normally stripped of the <b>donor’s</b> <b>identity</b> and subjectivity; objects not subjects, numbers not names. These kinds of collections are used in medical teaching practice, museum studies, {{and in the case}} of the Hunterian collection, are open to the public. My response to the collection was to write a series of six semi-fictive texts based on research into the Hunterian archive of specimen data. These subject narratives where then visually embodied through photographic images of the corresponding body areas and layered onto specially designed museum vitrines, in which the actual organ specimens from John Hunters eighteenth-century collection were sited. This was accompanied by a 12 min artist’s film of the organs ‘re-telling’ their stories, which played around, on and through the vitrines, suggesting the re-embodied specimens could now narrate their own tales of death and disease. These were sited in the museum and on display for six weeks, accompanied by a series of public talks and events. A 58 pages catalogue was produced with essays and image plates and a programme of events and exhibitions has continued beyond the exhibition period in the form of international screenings and conference presentations, publications and citations. The film is part of the Wellcome Collection, making it freely available worldwide. There is a comprehensive portfolio of evidence for the project demonstrating cultural and social impact...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The HFEA has {{authorised}} egg sharing since 1998; {{however it}} remains a controversial service. This paper reports on the first empirical study in the UK of the experiences {{of women who have}} considered egg sharing and their partners. Methods: Retrospective semi-structured interviews with 20 female patients - and 18 husbands/partners - attending one UK licensed treatment centre, all of whom had received counselling with a view to participating in the centre’s egg sharing programme. Results and Discussion: After counselling, 12 women proceeded with egg sharing (seven of whom were successful with their own treatment and five remained unsuccessful at the time of interview). Six women decided to proceed with egg sharing but did not produce enough oocytes to enable egg sharing to take place; two women decided not to proceed. Interview data included: (in) fertility history and motivation for egg sharing; treatment experiences; attitudes regarding recipients of donated oocytes, towards receiving information about outcomes of recipients’ treatment and regarding any children born following egg sharing; information management within their own family and social networks and responses of others within family and social networks. Egg sharing was supported as an acceptable means of family creation for involuntarily childless people with limited options. No participant regretted undertaking egg sharing. The majority of respondents distinguished egg sharing from remunerated donation, citing both altruism and self-interest as significant motivating factors. Almost all participants thought donor information should be updated periodically, in particular any new medical information. Participants were evenly divided whether they would wish to learn the outcome of a recipient’s treatment. Two thirds believed any child born following egg sharing should be told about their origins and half thought that the child should be able to learn the <b>donor’s</b> <b>identity.</b> A majority would continue to donate if they were identifiable to any chil...|$|R
