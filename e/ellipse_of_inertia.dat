40|$|Moments of inertia and {{products}} of inertia often {{need to be}} determined for aircraft. As complex bodies, their mass properties need to be determined experimentally for best accuracy. While several moment of inertia experimental techniques have been developed, there are few to determine the products of inertia. Products of inertia can be easily determined mathematically if the angle between the aircraft x body axis and principal x axis is known. This method finds the principal inclination angle by mathematically correlating the measured moments of inertia about a range of axes of the aircraft. This correlation uses a least squares error minimization of a mathematical model that describes the <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> in the aircraft's x-z axes plane. Results from a test conducted {{on a small scale}} UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) at NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center is also presented, which {{is an example of the}} intended application of this technique...|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the Glauber approach we analyze the shape parameters of the early-formed system and their event-by-event fluctuations. We test a variety of models: the conventional wounded nucleon model, a model admixing binary collisions to the wounded nucleons, a model with hot spots, as well as the hot-spot model where the deposition of energy occurs with a superimposed probability distribution. We look in detail at the so-called participant multipole moments, obtained by an averaging procedure where in each event the system is translated to its center of mass and aligned with the major principal axis of the <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia.</b> Quantitative comparisons indicate substantial relative effects for eccentricity in variants of Glauber models. On the other hand, the dependence of the scaled standard deviation of the participant eccentricity on the chosen model is weak. For all models the values range from about 0. 5 for the central collisions to about 0. 3 - 0. 4 for peripheral collisions, both for the gold-gold and copper-copper collisions. They are dominated by statistics and change only by 10 - 15 % from model to model. We provide an approximate analytic expansion for the multipole moments and their fluctuations given in terms of the fixed-axes moments. For central collisions {{and in the absence of}} correlations it gives the simple formula for the scaled standard deviation of the participant eccentricity: sqrt(4 /pi- 1). Similarly, we obtain expansions for the radial profiles of the multipole distributions. We investigate the relevance of the shape-fluctuation effects for jet quenching and find them important only for very central events. Finally, we argue how smooth hydro leads to the known result v_ 4 ~ v_ 2 ^ 2, and further to the prediction Delta v_ 4 /v_ 4 = 2 Delta v_ 2 /v_ 2.
