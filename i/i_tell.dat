5|$|Unfortunately, as <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, {{you have to deal with}} so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E

25|$|I am {{ashamed of}} what <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> them: {{that they should}} indeed worry about making an {{accusation}} because what they fear is likely to come true. Not {{one of the women}} I have heard from had an outcome that was not worse for her than silence. One, I recall, was drummed out of the school by peer pressure. Many faced bureaucratic stonewalling. Some women said they lost their academic status as golden girls overnight; grants dried up, letters of recommendation were no longer forthcoming. No one was met with a coherent process that was not weighted against them. Usually, the key decision-makers in the college or university—especially if it was a private university—joined forces to, in effect, collude with the faculty member accused; to protect not him necessarily but the reputation of the university, and to keep information from surfacing in a way that could protect other women. The goal seemed to be not to provide a balanced forum, but damage control.|$|E
