5|$|A delegation, {{consisting}} of {{the representatives of the}} twelve important clans of Medina, invited Muhammad to serve as chief arbitrator for the entire community; due to his status as a neutral outsider. There was fighting in Yathrib: primarily the dispute involved its Arab and Jewish inhabitants, and was estimated to have lasted for around a hundred years before 620. The recurring slaughters and disagreements over the resulting claims, especially after the Battle of Bu'ath in which all clans were involved, made it obvious to them that the tribal concept of blood-feud and an <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> were no longer workable unless there was one man with authority to adjudicate in disputed cases.

5000|$|According to best friend, Ray Vecchio, in An <b>Eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Eye,</b> Benton's {{problem is}} that [...] "if he sees a problem, he's gotta fix it, he can't even go to the mens room without {{stopping}} to tell some simple, stupid, charmingly-witty Inuit story, that inspires people {{to take on the}} world's social ills." [...] In [...] "The Blue Line", in season 1, it is revealed that Benton is a fan of Ice hockey, and that he used to play it as a child; and in [...] "Asylum", in season 3, it is shown that Benton is also a fan of curling. [...] Fraser has had an unfortunate recurring relationship with Victoria Metcalf, a bank robber with whom he became infatuated after pursuing her into and then helping her survive a lengthy winter storm. After the storm was over, Fraser turned Victoria in to the authorities and she was sent to prison. This encounter is first outlined in episode 14 of series 1, [...] "You must remember this"; during a stake-out Fraser comes the closest to 'baring his soul' before turning to find Vecchio asleep. That episode fades with Fraser looking at a slightly crumpled black-and-white photo of her. She later resurfaced in Chicago, blackmailing Fraser into helping her use the money from the bank robbery to buy jewels on the black market, threatening to have Ray Vecchio framed for corruption. She left Chicago soon after her plot unraveled, and was not seen again.|$|R

40|$|The pupillary {{axis of the}} <b>eye</b> is <b>a</b> {{clinically}} useful concept usually {{defined as}} the line through {{the centre of the}} entrance pupil that is perpendicular to the cornea. However if the cornea is astigmaticthen, strictly speaking, the entrance pupil is blurred and the pupillary axis is not well defined.   A modified definition is offered in this paper: the pupillary axis is the infinite straight line containing the incident segment of the ray that passes through the centre of the (actual) pupil and is perpendicular to the first surface of the eye.   The definition holds <b>for</b> the naked <b>eye</b> and <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> with <b>an</b> implant in the anterior chamber.   It also holds for the com-pound system of eye and optical instrument such as a contact lens in front of it if the first surface is interpreted as the first surface of the compound system and the pupil as the limiting aperture of the compound system.   Linear optics is applied to obtain <b>a</b> formula <b>for</b> the position and inclination of the pupillary axis at incidence onto the system; the refracting surfaces may be heterocentric and astigmatic.   The formula allows one to examine the sensitivity of the pupillary axis to displacement of the pupil and any other changes in the anterior eye.   Strictly the pupillary axis depends on the frequency of light but examples show that the dependence is probably negligible.   The vectorized generalization of what is sometimes called angle lambda is easily calculated from the inclination of the pupillary axis and the line of sight.

40|$|This book is {{a message}} to be humble before truth and reality and to {{relinquish}} the idea of controlling them. Planners do not have that much control. In retrospect, {{it was easy to}} conclude that in conditions of constant population growth and with an economy in fairly good shape, a linear model of urban development would be relatively easy to maintain: the origin of the idea of certainty and control. The population in the Western world is no longer growing though; on the contrary, many regions and cities are facing population decline. Added to that, the economy is proving quite uncertain as well. The two together impact on spatial development. This all means that we have to consider a fundamentally different perspective on the role of spatial planning and its position in urban and rural development. Instead of planning aiming to achieve controlled development, it might get more out of the various autonomous processes affecting urban and the rural areas. In addition to planners being experts or mediators, we might appreciate planners becoming managers of change, transition managers, adaptive responders and social entrepreneurs, supporting and guiding the various parties within urban and rural areas to find the positions which suit them best. This book acknowledges these new identities and positions, with the planner acting as a manager of change. This book tries to present arguments in support of a discipline of spatial planning which adopts a different stance to the world, a more adaptive stance, and with <b>a</b> keen <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> self-organization processes: <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> non-linear kinds of planning in a world of change...|$|R
25|$|By Hammurabi's time, {{almost all}} trace of tribal custom had already {{disappeared}} from {{the law of the}} Code. It is state law—self-help, blood-feud, and marriage by capture, are all absent; though code of family solidarity, district responsibility, ordeal, and the lex talionis (an <b>eye</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye),</b> are primitive features that remain. The king is a benevolent autocrat, easily accessible to all his subjects, both able and willing to protect the weak against the highest-placed oppressor. The royal power, however, can only pardon when private resentment is appeased. Judges are strictly supervised, and appeal is allowed. The whole land is covered with feudal holdings, masters of the levy, police, etc. There is a regular postal system. The pax Babylonica is so assured that private individuals do not hesitate to ride in their carriage from Babylon to the coast of the Mediterranean. The position of women is free and dignified.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experiments}} {{is the development of}} <b>a</b> non-invasive technique <b>for</b> determining the location of an ultrasonic focus in the wall of the human eye. This would enable improvements in ultrasonic biometry and in ultrasonic tissue characterisation in the eye. Ultrasonic biometry is today generally accepted for clinical measurements of axial length in the human eye. Ultrasonic radio frequency signal analysis is used for the tissue-characterisation of small regions of interest in the ocular wall. Up to now in both applications the precise location of the area examined ultrasonically in <b>an</b> individual <b>eye</b> is not exactly known, because the acoustical beam undergoes refraction and diffraction by the components of the <b>eye.</b> <b>For</b> the study, <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> model, consisting of an artificial cornea, a typical intraocular implant lens and a thein polyethylene pellicle simulating the retinal membrane was built. The model was irradiated in water by ultrasonic pulses from a medical A-mode transducer for biometry of the eye (single element, piston type, 8 MHz nominal center frequency, 1 kHz pulse repetition rate) and by a laser beam simultaneously. The slight vibration of the simulated retina induced by the ultrasonic pulses caused a phase modulation of the light beam proportional to the amplitude of motion. The modulation was analysed in a MACH-ZENDER type interferometer, using heterodyne technique. We succeeded in detecting ultrasound induced vibrations of the pellicle with a high spatial resolution, resulting in amplitudes of about 10 nm in the centre and below 1 nm at the margins of the ultrasonic focus. Averaging of many transients enhanced the resolution up to the sub-nm regime. The results encourage further experiments to detect the location of an ultrasonic beam in the eye wall, passing both the acoustical and optical beam through the cornea and lens of <b>an</b> <b>eye.</b> This study is part of the project: "Opto-acoustical biometry of the eye" supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Bonn...|$|R
