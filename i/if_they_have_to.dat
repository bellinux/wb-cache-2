Those who have experienced a loss of trust will often also experience some form of grief.|$|E
25|$|Using the {{criterion}} for Kaldor–Hicks improvement, an outcome is an improvement if those that are made better off could in principle compensate those that are made worse off, so that a Pareto improving outcome could (though does not have to) be achieved. For example, a voluntary exchange that creates pollution would be a Kaldor–Hicks improvement if the buyers and sellers are still willing {{to carry out the}} transaction even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fully compensate the victims of the pollution. Kaldor–Hicks does not require compensation actually be paid, merely that the possibility for compensation exists, and thus need not leave each at least as well off. Under Kaldor–Hicks efficiency, an improvement can in fact leave some people worse off. Pareto-improvements require making every party involved better off (or at least no worse off).|$|E
500|$|Kakashi Hatake is {{introduced}} {{as the leader}} in charge of Team 7, a new ninja team including Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. He first appears as a carefree character as he tends to lose track of time, and is frequently late to his appointments as a result. However, when testing his students, Kakashi reveals himself as a strong opponent to the point he fights while reading [...] series of erotic novels. Kakashi is revealed to be very famous in the Naruto world, earning him the moniker [...] for possessing the Sharingan, gaining it from {{a member of the}} Uchiha clan he was friends with. It grants him the ability to mimic the movements and jutsu of others. Although most of Kakashi's abilities were acquired with his Sharingan, he also invented the Chidori and its [...] Lightning Blade variation, a collection of lightning chakra in one's hand that uses the Sharingan's visual ability to lock onto a target. When first forming Team 7, Kakashi does not turn them into his students until instilling in them the concept of teamwork even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> break the rules he gave them. Kakashi continues to further this philosophy for the duration of Part I upon Sasuke Uchiha but is unable to get through to him before the latter's defection from Konoha. Kakashi also reluctantly participates in various kinds of challenges by his childhood friend Might Guy who considers Kakashi his rival.|$|E

500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga, anime, video games, {{and other}} related media have provided praise and criticism on Kakashi's character. Christopher A. Born regards Kakashi's teaching of Team 7 {{to work as a}} team, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> break the rules, to be reinforcing the Confucian values of the [...] "importance of benevolence and reciprocity". IGN noted the duality of Kakashi's serious persona in combat and his laid back, apathetic countenance when dealing with his students, but accepted that {{he is one of the}} most popular characters in the series. They also commented that Kakashi is one of the more popular characters they have seen cosplayed at anime conventions. Active Anime celebrated Kakashi's abilities, noting that he fell into the overall theme of characters hiding detailed personalities and secrets. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews derided Kakashi as a stereotypical [...] "Man of Mystery" [...] seen in other shōnen manga, but praised him as being [...] "much more interesting" [...] than the three main characters, and felt that for all intents and purposes, the show could be renamed simply [...] "Kakashi". Mania Entertainment's Dani Moure likes how Kakashi fits into Team 7 because he is a [...] "hilarious character in that sometimes he doesn't seem all that bothered about things and yet is so masterful of his craft." [...] Chris Beveridge from the site stated that Kakashi is his favorite character from the series because of his personality and praised his fight against Pain, and that after its ending, the character gets [...] "a very humanizing moment", making the episode from the battle stand out. Manga author Yoshihiro Togashi found Kakashi's first battle against his students as one of the first series' moments that impressed him due to how the difference in strength between such characters was shown by just making Kakashi read a book during the fight. IGN ranked him as the 15th greatest anime character of all time, saying that [...] "He's a complex character, with an iconic character design and a laid back attitude that just exudes cool." [...] Amy McNulty from Anime News Network highly praised Kakashi's fight against Obito Uchiha due to its animation and the references to the two fighters' childhoods. In 2014, IGN listed him as the best Naruto character when the series ended.|$|E

It was also called [...] "normalisation", or [...] "police primacy". [...] The term [...] "Ulsterisation" [...] was coined by the media. The then Assistant Chief Constable of the RUC, Jack Hermon, summed it up when he said, [...] "Ulstermen need to learn to live together and be policed by Ulstermen. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> kill, let them kill each other, not English soldiers." ...|$|E
