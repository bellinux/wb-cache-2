500|$|The movie's strange title {{originated}} from something said by Ringo Starr, who described {{it this way}} {{in an interview with}} disc jockey Dave Hull in 1964: [...] "We went to do a job, and we'd worked all day and we happened to work all night. I came up still thinking it was day I suppose, and I said, 'It's been a hard day ...' and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> saw it was dark so I said, '... night!' So we came to A Hard Day's Night." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, Andrews {{appeared}} in The Princess Diaries, her first Disney film since Mary Poppins (1964). She starred as Queen Clarisse Marie Renaldi and reprised the {{role in a}} sequel, [...] (2004). In The Princess Diaries 2, Andrews sang on film {{for the first time}} since having throat surgery. The song, [...] "Your Crowning Glory" [...] (a duet with teen idol Raven-Symoné), was set in a limited range of an octave to accommodate her recovering voice. The film's music supervisor, Dawn Soler, recalled that Andrews [...] "nailed the song on the first take. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> I saw grips with tears in their eyes." ...|$|E

60|$|As I said, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> {{behind me}} found a heavy spade the {{gardener}} had {{at one time}} or another used for digging post holes. It was a strong and sharp implement, and I took it up with a good deal of satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|I {{heard the}} door close gently. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> there stood Mr. Bixby, smiling a bland, sweet smile. Then the {{audience}} on the hurricane deck sent up a thundergust of humiliating laughter. I saw it all, now, and I felt meaner than the meanest man in human history. I laid in the lead, set the boat in her marks, came ahead on the engines, and said-- ...|$|E
60|$|About {{this time}} I begun to run across piles of those traps, {{lying in the}} road. I just quietly dumped my extra cargo along with them. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and,</b> Peters, that whole nation that was {{following}} me were loaded down the same as I'd been. The return crowd had got them to hold their things a minute, you see. They all dumped their loads, too, and we went on.|$|E

'Paisley ain't here,' says I. 'We've got to wait for Paisley. A friend once, a friend always--that's Telemachus Hicks,' says I.

[...] Canadian actor Tom McCamus originally auditioned for the part of Old Nick before being cast as Leo.

60|$|I {{took the}} grapnel from Maiden's Heart, {{who seemed to}} give it up reluctantly, and as I hooked it on the wall, I felt a hand upon my shoulder. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> saw the sentinel. He held out to me another bean. It was too dark to see the quality of it, but I thought it was very small. However, I bought it. One of these fellows must be treated as well as the other.|$|E
6000|$|Red said, carelessly, [...] "He's around somewhere. We {{were just}} sort of walking and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> he wasn't there."

6000|$|And so, good easy man, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> me, <b>and</b> {{said that}} full surely my greatness was a-ripening. Who thinks of winter and its frosts {{in the glow}} of such a summer as I enjoyed? ...|$|R

60|$|But I {{was doomed}} {{to live and}} in two months found myself as awaking from a dream, in a prison, {{stretched}} on a wretched bed, surrounded by jailers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon. It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had forgotten the particulars {{of what had happened}} and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.|$|E
60|$|Strange to say, I do not at {{this late}} day {{remember}} a detail of how I was ditched at Rawlins. I remember watching the train as it was immediately swallowed up in the snow-storm, and of heading for a saloon to warm up. Here was light and warmth. Everything was in full blast and wide open. Faro, roulette, craps, and poker tables were running, and some mad cow-punchers were making the night merry. I had just succeeded in fraternizing with them and was downing my first drink at their expense, when a heavy hand descended on my shoulder. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> sighed. It was the sheriff.|$|E
60|$|After {{the captain}} left me <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> saw {{that no one}} else was nigh upon the deck. I took my {{calabash}} gourds and entered the boat that hung from the davits astern. Taking a hint from Captain Leach, I had secured a coil of line by which I might lower myself into the water, for if I had dropped with a splash I would have been pretty sure to have been discovered. Having removed my shoes and stockings, which I wrapped in a piece of tarpaulin, together with my tinder-box and flint and steel, all of which I secured upon my head, and having slipped the cords which bound the calabashes under my arms, I slid down the line into the water astern.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> me despairingly, <b>and</b> my eye alighted on the holland covering. [...] "There {{is a fine}} {{chandelier}} in that holland bag," [...] I said coaxingly.|$|R

"Precisely," [...] exclaimed Mr. Crewe, [...] "and when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> me <b>and</b> see {{the things}} crying {{to be done}} in this State, and no lawmaker with sense and {{foresight}} enough to propose them, it makes me sick. Now, for instance," [...] he continued, and rose with an evident attempt to assault the forestry shelves. But Austen rose too.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> {{literally}} <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> said [...] "me?" [...] It was shocking," [...] Britt said. [...] "I was 53 at the time, {{and that}} record dealwas {{the last thing}} I expected {{to come out of}} either of their mouths. It was exciting and surprising; a sense of new hope just came over me. Etta Britt, Falls Church News-Press, October 3, 2012.|$|R
6000|$|... "Late upon a warm {{afternoon}} I {{was entering}} {{the town of}} Ivrea, and passing a large stone building, I stopped to examine some leaves on a bush which grew by the roadside. While I was doing this, and comparing the shape {{and size of the}} leaves with some drawings I had in a book which I took from my pocket, I heard a voice behind me and apparently above me. Some one was speaking to me, and speaking in Latin. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> up, but could see no one; but above me, about ten or twelve feet from the ground, there was a long, narrow slit of a window such as is seen in prisons. Again I heard the voice, and it said to me distinctly in Latin, 'Are you free to go where you choose?' It was the voice of a woman.|$|E
60|$|And then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> saw the Fool-Killer, as he {{had always}} {{appeared}} to my imagination, sitting at a nearby table, and regarding us with his reddish, fatal, relentless eyes. He was Jesse Holmes from top to toe; he had the long, gray, ragged beard, the gray clothes of ancient cut, the executioner's look, and the dusty shoes of one who had been called from afar. His eyes were turned fixedly upon Kerner. I shuddered to think that I had invoked him from his assiduous southern duties. I thought of flying, and then I kept my seat, reflecting that many men had escaped his ministrations when it seemed that nothing short of an appointment as Ambassador to Spain could save them from him. I had called my brother Kerner a fool and {{was in danger of}} hell fire. That was nothing; but I would try to save him from Jesse Holmes.|$|E
60|$|Yesterday morning, when I {{entered the}} study, {{there he was}} in the chair. When I had dispelled him, I sat in the chair myself all day. I had my meals brought to me. And thus I escaped the sight of him for many hours, for he appears only in the chair. I was weary, but I sat late, until eleven o'clock. Yet, when I stood up to go to bed, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> there he was. He had slipped into the chair on the instant. Being only fabric of fancy, all day he had resided in my brain. The moment it was unoccupied, he took up his {{residence}} in the chair. Are these his boasted higher planes of existence--his brother's brain and a chair? After all, was he not right? Has his eternal form become so attenuated as to be an hallucination? Are hallucinations real entities? Why not? There is food for thought here. Some day I shall come to a conclusion upon it.|$|E
60|$|I went {{below and}} did what I could for my wound; it pained me a good deal and still bled freely, but it was neither deep nor dangerous, nor did it greatly gall me when I used my arm. Then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> me, <b>and</b> as the ship was now, in a sense, my own, I {{began to think of}} {{clearing}} it from its last passenger--the dead man, O'Brien.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> me, dazed <b>and</b> bewildered; {{gradually}} {{the horrors of}} the past hour came back to me, and I had to close my eyes again, for I felt sick and giddy with the sheer memory of it all.|$|R
60|$|I was so {{worked up}} over my {{discovery}} that I left the forecastle without taking {{the trouble to}} don the clothing Lowell had pointed out to me. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> the deck, <b>and</b> seeing the boatswain at the bow, hastened towards him.|$|R
60|$|Just as I {{was getting}} my whole soul full of this lovely ruralness, down came {{a shower of}} rain without giving the least notice. I gave a jump in my seat as I felt it on me, and began {{to get ready to}} get down as soon as the coachman should stop for us all to get inside; but he didn't stop, but just drove along as if the sun was shining and the balmy breezes blowing, and then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> not a soul of the eight people on the top of that coach showed the least sign of expecting to get down and go inside. They all sat there just as if nothing was happening, and not one of them even {{mentioned}} the rain. But I noticed that each of them had on a mackintosh or some kind of cape, whereas Jone and I never thought of taking anything in the way of waterproof or umbrellas, as it was perfectly clear when we started.|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{nature and}} doctrines I am {{addicted}} to the habit of discovering choice places wherein to feed. So <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> found a proposition that exactly cut the mustard. I found a restaurant tent just opened up by an outfit that had drifted in on {{the tail of the}} boom. They had knocked together a box house, where they lived and did the cooking, and served the meals in a tent pitched against the side. That tent was joyful with placards on it calculated to redeem the world-worn pilgrim from the sinfulness of boarding houses and pick-me- up hotels. 'Try Mother's Home-Made Biscuits,' 'What's the Matter with Our Apple Dumplings and Hard Sauce?' 'Hot Cakes and Maple Syrup Like You Ate When a Boy,' 'Our Fried Chicken Never Was Heard to Crow'-- there was literature doomed to please the digestions of man! I said to myself that mother's wandering boy should munch there that night. And so it came to pass. And there is where I contracted my case of Mame Dugan.|$|E

It seems to me as if your feet must stick out of it.' 'They do,' says he, 'and I sometimes throw a blanket over them to keep them dry. But we are goin' to make different arrangements here. Mr. Clyde and I will bring down his tent after breakfast, and if Mr. Raybold doesn't choose to occupy it, Mr. Clyde says I may share it with him.

60|$|The ring {{of people}} widened {{outward from the}} inner side as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> me; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> smelt vinegar, and what I know to be camphor, thrown in towards where I sat. Presently some one put a great vessel of smoking vinegar on the ground near me; and then they all looked at me in silent horror as I ate and drank of what was brought for me.
