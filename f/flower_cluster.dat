5|$|Members of {{the family}} Apiaceae bear close {{resemblance}} to each other, and have many characteristics in common. Cicuta spp. are often mistaken for edible plants such as kvanne (Angelica archangelica), wild celery (Apium graveolens), pignut (Conopodium majus), wild carrot (Daucus carota), wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), and water parsnip (Berula spp.). One of the more common misidentifications is between water hemlock and water parsnip; both have clusters of small white flowers shaped like umbrellas, and both have the same habitat near the shore line of lakes and rivers. Differences between water parsnip and water hemlock include the water parsnip having leaves only once compound while the water hemlock has leaves which are {{two or three times}} compound. Water hemlock also has a large swelling at the stem base which water parsnip lacks. Additionally, water hemlock has bracts at the base of each small <b>flower</b> <b>cluster,</b> not {{at the base of the}} main flower head, while water parsnip has both bracts at the base of flowers and also at the main flower head.|$|E

2500|$|Cannabis strains with {{relatively}} high CBD:THC ratios {{are less likely}} to induce anxiety than vice versa. This may be due to CBD's antagonistic effects at the cannabinoid receptors, compared to THC's partial agonist effect. CBD is also a 5-HT1A receptor (serotonin) agonist, which may also contribute to an anxiolytic-content effect. The effects of sativa are well known for its cerebral high, while indica is well known for its sedative effects which some prefer for night time use. Both types are used as [...] medical cannabis. Indica plants are normally shorter and stockier than sativas. They have broader, deeply serrated leaves and a compact and dense <b>flower</b> <b>cluster.</b>|$|E

50|$|In botany, a glume is a bract (leaf-like structure) below a {{spikelet}} in the inflorescence (<b>flower</b> <b>cluster)</b> of grasses (Poaceae) or {{the flowers}} of sedges (Cyperaceae). There {{are two other}} types of bracts in the spikelets of grasses: the lemma and palea.|$|E
50|$|The green vines {{have few}} narrow leaves and are {{themselves}} photosynthetic. In early- and mid-spring, <b>flower</b> <b>clusters</b> {{occur in a}} circular or half-globe cluster of 7 to 13+ florets, with each floret about 3/8 of an inch. The <b>flower</b> <b>clusters</b> are sometimes profuse and therefore noticeable. When the dried seedpods remain months later, after the vines have desiccated, they are the plant identifier. Another indicator of the plant's presence is the inundation of the supporting species, or multiple species, by quantities of vines.|$|R

50|$|The inflorescences are {{consisting}} in pseudo-umbels (a flat-topped or rounded <b>flower</b> <b>cluster)</b> {{that are}} arranged in a racime, sometimes condensed, or a short-shoot or rarely sessile.

50|$|A spathe {{is a large}} bract or pair of bracts {{forming a}} sheath to enclose the <b>flower</b> <b>cluster</b> of such plants as palms, arums, Irises, Crocuses, and dayflowers. In many arums (Araceae family), the spathe is petal-like, {{attracting}} pollinators to the flowers arranged on a type of spike called a spadix.|$|E

40|$|The ion-beam {{breeding}} {{developed by}} the Ring cyclotron of RARF is highly effective to create new flower cultivars within a short duration. A new type of garden plants “Temari ” series (Verbena hybrida) keeps many <b>flower</b> <b>clusters</b> from spring until autumn, however “Coral Pink ” of this series shows poor <b>flower</b> <b>clusters.</b> To improve “Coral Pink ” using the ion-beam irradiation, sixty four single nodes were cultured in one plastic dish which was treated with 1 - 10 Gy of the N-ion beam at 135 MeV/u. Finally, four mutant lines with rich blooming were successfully selected. These mutants grew well compared to host plant, and kept many <b>flower</b> <b>clusters</b> even in autumn. The best mutant had larger number of <b>flower</b> <b>clusters</b> than the host plant in the pot-planting test {{so that it was}} released to the market in 2002 with a level of several hundred thousand pots. The development period of the new “Coral Pink ” was only three years. The similar successful cases were demonstrated by the new Dahlia ”World ” (2002), the new Verbena ”Sakura” (2003) and the new Petunia “Rose ” (2003). Thus, we conclude that the ion beam irradiation is an excellent tool for mutation breeding to improve horticultural and agricultural crops with high efficiency...|$|R
