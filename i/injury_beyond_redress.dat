Scanning electron microscopy of microcarrier-based cell cultures, digital holographic microscopy of living single cells, and quantitative apoptosis/necrosis assays demonstrate that Stx 1 causes both necrosis and apoptosis, whereas Stx 2 induces almost exclusively apoptosis in both cell lines. Moreover, microvascular and macrovascular endothelial cells have different susceptibilities to the toxins: EA. hy 926 cells are slightly, but significantly (∼ 10 times) more susceptible to Stx 1, whereas HBMECs are strikingly (≥ 1, 000 times) more susceptible to Stx 2.

Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) exploit the ability of human communica-tion and control bypassing the classical neuromuscular communication channels.

40|$|We {{describe}} an 18 -year-old male with cervical flexion myelopathy with Hirayama disease-like features who showed apparent long tract signs. He first experienced insidious-onset hand muscle weakness and atrophy {{at the age}} of 15. Subsequently, he developed sensory disturbance in his lower limb. Neurological examination revealed atrophy and weakness in the right hand and forearm, pyramidal signs in the right lower extremity, and disturbance of superficial sensation in the lower left half of the body. Cervical magnetic resonance images and computed tomographic myelography revealed anterior displacement with compression of the cervical cord in flexion that was more apparent in the right side. The right side of the cervical cord showed severe atrophy. The mechanisms of myelopathy in our patient appeared to be same as that of "tight dural canal in flexion," which has been reported to be the mechanism of juvenile muscular atrophy of the unilateral upper extremity (Hirayama disease). Patients with Hirayama disease generally show minimal sensory signs and no pyramidal signs.

40|$|Medical adhesive-related skin injury (MARSI) is a prevalent, under-recognised and {{preventable}} complication {{that occurs}} across all care settings, age groups and patient types, from healthy patients in ambulatory care, {{to patients with}} multiple comorbidities in critical care (McNichol et al, 2013). MARSI {{has been defined as}} “an occurrence in which erythema and/or other manifestation of cutaneous abnorma (including, but not limited to, vesicle, bulla, erosion, or tear) persists 30 minutes or more after removal of the adhesive” (McNichol et al, 2013). When superficial layers of skin are removed by medical adhesive, the process may affect skin integrity, cause pain, increase risk of infection, potentially increase wound size and delay healing, all of which reduce patient quality of life unnecessarily (Cutting, 2008). In some cases, adhesives can also cause deeper tissue <b>injuries</b> <b>beyond</b> the loss of superficial skin layers (Denyer, 2011). Although the injuries caused by medical adhesives may look minor, care and management of MARSI has a deleterious effect on nursing resources.

40|$|The role of {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} in renal fibrosis. Several studies suggest {{a close relationship}} between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and renal inflammation and fibrosis, which are crucial stages in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Beneficial effects of n- 3 PUFA on the course of experimental and human nephropathies have been reported. PUFA can ameliorate chronic, progressive renal <b>injury</b> <b>beyond</b> the simple reduction of serum lipid levels. These pleiotropic effects of PUFA are due to their properties of interfering with the synthesis {{of a variety of}} inflammatory factors and events, through effects related both to the modulation of the balance of n- 6 and n- 3 -derived eicosanoids and to direct action on the cellular production of the major cytokine mediators of inflammation and on endothelium function. The mechanisms by which PUFA can favorably interfere with some stages in renal fibrosis processes, such as mesangial cell activation and proliferation and extracellular matrix protein synthesis, include the regulation of some pro-inflammatory cytokine production, renin and nitric oxide (NO) systems and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gene expression. An optimal n- 6 /n- 3 PUFA ratio dietary intake could offer new therapeutic strategies aimed at interrupting the irreversible process of renal fibrosis and ameliorating chronic renal injury. However, further experimental, epidemiological and clinical investigations are needed to confirm the role of PUFA in the renal fibrosis pathway and the natural history of chronic nephropathies...|$|R
40|$|Streptolysin O (SLO) is a cholesterol-dependent {{cytolysin}} {{produced by}} the important human pathogen, group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes or GAS).

Production of both NADase and SLO is associated with augmented host cell <b>injury</b> <b>beyond</b> that produced by SLO alone, but the mechanism of enhanced cytotoxicity is not known. We have now shown that expression of NADase together with SLO dramatically enhanced the lytic activity of GAS culture supernatants for erythrocytes but {{had no effect on}} SLO-mediated poration of synthetic cholesterol-rich liposomes. This result revealed a previously unknown contribution of NADase to the cytolytic activity associated with GAS production of SLO. Purified recombinant SLO bound NADase in vitro, supporting a specific, physical interaction of the two proteins. Exposure of human keratinocytes to wild-type GAS, but not to a NADase-deficient mutant strain, resulted in profound depletion of cellular NAD+ and ATP. Furthermore, expression of recombinant GAS NADase in yeast, in the absence of SLO, induced growth arrest, depletion of NAD+ and ATP, and cell death. These findings have provided evidence that the augmentation of SLO-mediated cytotoxicity by NADase is a consequence of depletion of host cell energy stores through the enzymatic action of NADase.

Early-onset disease is heralded by pneumonia and lung injury, and the lung may serve as a portal of entry for GBS into the bloodstream. To examine a potential role for GBS beta-hemolysin in lung epithelial injury, five wild-type strains varying in beta-hemolysin expression were chosen, along with five nonhemolytic (NH) and five hyperhemolytic (HH) variants of these strains derived by chemical or transposon mutagenesis. Monolayers of A 549 alveolar epithelial cells were exposed to log-phase GBS or stabilized hemolysin extracts of GBS cultures, and cellular injury was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and trypan blue nuclear staining. Whereas NH strains produced no detectable <b>injury</b> <b>beyond</b> baseline (medium alone), hemolysin-producing strains induced LDH release from A 549 cells in direct correlation to their ability to lyse sheep erythrocytes.

BackgroundHyperglycemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiac events, but limited information is available on its relationship to subclinical myocardial damage. Elevated cardiac troponin T even below traditional detection levels can be detected by a novel high-sensitivity assay. MethodsWe examined the association between baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) in 9, 661 participants free of CHD and heart failure in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study. Multivariable logistic regression models characterized the association between clinical categories of HbA 1 c (< 5. 7 %, 5. 7 % to 6. 4 %, and ≥ 6. 5 %) and our primary outcome of elevated hs-cTnT (≥ 14 ng/l). ResultsHigher baseline values of HbA 1 c were associated in a graded fashion with elevated hs-cTnT (p for trend < 0. 001). After adjusting for traditional risk factors, compared to persons with HbA 1 c < 5. 7 %, the odds ratios of elevated hs-cTnT for persons with HbA 1 c 5. 7 % to 6. 4 % and ≥ 6. 5 % were 1. 26 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 01 to 1. 56) and 1. 97 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 44 to 2. 70), respectively.

Urinary level of β 2 -microglobulin (Uβ 2 MG) was measured {{on the day before}} the operation {{as well as on the}} 1 st, and 7 thpost PCNL days. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy was performed using standard method. Patients’ demographic and peri-operative data were collected to evaluate factors influencing renal injury. RESULTS: Median urinary levels of β 2 -microglobulin on pre-operative, 1 st, and 7 thpostoperative days were 0. 2 mg/dL (range, 0. 1 to 82), 0. 4 mg/dL (range, 0. 2 to 97), and 0. 2 mg/dL (range, 0. 2 to 114), respectively. High levels of Uβ 2 MG (> 2. 3 mg/dL) were observed in 10 (9 %), 20 (19 %), and 10 (9 %) patients pre-operatively and on the 1 st, and 7 thpostoperative days, respectively. In multivariable analysis, Uβ 2 MG on the 1 stpostoperative day was associated with pre-operative serum creatinine level (P <. 001) and diabetes mellitus (P =. 05), while Uβ 2 MG on the 7 thday after the operation was associated with pre-operative serum creatinine level (P =. 01), diabetes mellitus (P =. 01), and PCNL time (P =. 02).
