50|$|In {{the early}} part of the twentieth century, the shafts at Quincy Mine were {{increasing}} in depth at a prodigious rate as the company pushed farther underground in search of copper. Between 1905 and 1920, the depth of the principal shafts increased from 5000 feet to over 7000. The requirements to lift rock to the surface from ever-increasing depths severely strained the capabilities of the company's mine <b>hoist</b> <b>equipment.</b> By 1916, the hoist servicing the number 2 shaft had reached its depth limit. Rather than abandon the shaft or eke out a little more depth by retrofitting the existing hoist, Quincy hired the Nordberg Manufacturing Company and Bruno V. Nordberg to design a new hoist engine at a cost of $160,000. It would be the largest mine hoist in the world.|$|R

5000|$|In 1870, {{the rich}} massive copper had been worked out, {{and the depth}} of the mine shafts had reached the limit of the <b>hoisting</b> <b>{{equipment}}.</b> At the same time, the price of copper dropped to $0.19 per pound, down from a high of $0.55 in 1864. Rather than invest in new equipment and explore for new ore bodies, the company stopped working the mine, and turned it over to tributer [...] - [...] independent miners who paid for the privilege of mining, usually paying a share of the ore they took out. The mine continued to be profitable to tributers, who took out 270 tons (245 mt) of copper in 1870, the same year that the mine closed. In 1876, the Minesota company paid a final dividend and went out of business, having paid a total of $1.82 million in dividends, versus $456,000 in assessments.|$|E

40|$|The wire ropes {{are used}} in {{different}} industrial fields. Their construction depends {{on the type of}} equipment and its purpose. Most frequently we meet with ropes at different transport and <b>hoisting</b> <b>equipments</b> and very freqently in the civil industry. For users characteristics are important which must meet requirements of the individual regulations and standards of the selection of wire ropes for the concrete equipment. The most important is the factor of safety being safeguarded by the corresponding bearing capacity of the rope. The service life of rope is interesting for the user, too, because of having an influence on the economy of the equipment on which the rope is working. These problems are solved by the grant project at our department. We are aimed at questions of the optimization of construction of wire rope with regard to their geometric construction and service life. Respectively on the basis of elaborated computer software eightstrand ropes of parallel construction were disigned and produced at the DrÃ´tov Åˆ a Hlohovec. The results of the fatigue tests confirmed their better qualitative properties, longer service life and economy advantages for users, too. Their using is possible and suitable on the new hoisting eguipment on the surface, in the undeground and in the hole drilling industry. By the application of the computer technique is also possible to improve the parametres of six-strands` construction of rope, the classic and parallel constructions, especially their bearing capacity. This fact follows from the knowledge that for the production of rope we use calculated diameters of wires, which secure better utilization of the metal cross-section of the wire ropes...|$|R
