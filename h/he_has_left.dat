He has bequeathed a picture of Christ-like life. What Fr. Kapaun willed to us cannot be contained in memorials, however costly or beautiful. It is a treasure for the human soul– the spirit of one who loved and served God and man– even unto death.|$|E

25|$|The show's opening credit {{sequence}} {{shows the}} Arthur Daley and Terry McCann characters negotiating over {{the sale of}} the white Ford Capri interspersed with still photos of the two main characters, highlighting Terry's credentials as a retired boxer and ex-convict, this presumably symbolising the characters' first meeting and the terms of their partnership.
