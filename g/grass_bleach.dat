60|$|It {{was early}} in the evening, with the sun not yet out of sight behind a lofty ridge that topped the valley slope. High <b>grass,</b> <b>bleached</b> white, shone brightly on the summit. Soon several columns of blue smoke curled lazily aloft until, {{catching}} the wind high up, they were swept away. Meanwhile the men talked at their tasks.|$|R
60|$|The {{avalanche}} slipped {{with little}} jerks, as if treacherously loosing its {{hold for a}} long plunge. The line of fire below ate at the <b>bleached</b> <b>grass</b> and the long column of smoke curled away on the wind.|$|R
60|$|When the {{operation}} last described has been concluded, the new-made tappa is {{spread out on}} the <b>grass</b> to <b>bleach</b> and dry, and soon becomes of a dazzling whiteness. Sometimes, in the first stages of the manufacture, the substance is impregnated with a vegetable juice, which gives it a permanent colour. A rich brown and a bright yellow are occasionally seen, but the simple taste of the Typee people inclines them to prefer the natural tint.|$|R
60|$|The Mormon ranches were {{scattered}} along the few green valleys. Cattle were scarce, {{only a few}} herds dotting the endless sweeps of green sage and <b>bleached</b> <b>grass.</b> As he traveled farther westward, however, the numbers of wild horses increased until they ran into the thousands.|$|R
60|$|Lifting {{her again}} lightly in his arms, he carried {{her a few}} steps to the sunny opening, and bade her bury her feet in the dried mosses and baked {{withered}} <b>grasses</b> that were <b>bleaching</b> in a hollow. The young girl uttered a cry of childish delight, as the soft ciliated fibres touched her sensitive skin.|$|R
60|$|Camp {{was made}} in an open wood. Darkness fell and the men were resting on bough beds, feet to the fire, with Tom curled up close by, and the horses still {{drooping}} {{where they had been}} unsaddled. Morning, however, discovered them grazing on the long, <b>bleached</b> <b>grass.</b> John shook his head when he looked at them.|$|R
60|$|Then came {{hours of}} {{climbing}} such slopes and benches and ledges as Lucy {{had not yet}} encountered. The grasping spikes of dead cedar tore her dress to shreds, and many a scratch burned her flesh. About {{the middle of the}} afternoon Creech led up over the last declivity, a yellow slope of cedar, to a flat upland covered with pine and high <b>bleached</b> <b>grass.</b> They rested.|$|R
60|$|Camp {{was made}} {{at the edge of}} the devastated timber zone that Carley had found so dispiriting. A few melancholy pines were standing, and everywhere, as far as she could see southward, were {{blackened}} fallen trees and stumps. It was a dreary scene. The few cattle grazing on the <b>bleached</b> <b>grass</b> appeared as melancholy as the pines. The sun shone fitfully at sunset, and then sank, leaving the land to twilight and shadows.|$|R
60|$|The thaw {{had begun}} {{when she walked}} home from the Broadwood farm one afternoon. The snow had {{vanished}} as if by magic, and shallow lagoons glittered among the <b>bleached</b> <b>grass.</b> The sky was a brilliant blue, and rounded clouds with silver edges rolled across it before the fresh northwest breeze which would blow persistently until summer was done. Their swift shadows streaked the plain and passed, leaving it suffused with light. There was a genial softness in the air.|$|R
60|$|Beyond {{the canyon}} the cedared desert heaved higher and changed its aspect. The trees grew larger, bushier, greener, and closer together, with patches of <b>bleached</b> <b>grass</b> between, and russet-lichened rocks everywhere. Small cactus plants {{bristled}} sparsely in open places; and {{here and there}} bright red flowers--Indian paintbrush, Flo called them--added a touch of color to the gray. Glenn pointed to where dark banks of cloud had massed around the mountain peaks. The scene to the west was somber and compelling.|$|R
60|$|The {{cold wind}} stung {{his face and}} made his eyes water. Curly loped at his easy swift stride over the well-trodden trail. The <b>bleached</b> <b>grass</b> waved, the tumbleweeds rolled along the brown ground. There was no sun. All the west was draped in drab clouds. Soon Pan was riding down into the swale where Blake lived. The cottonwoods were almost bare. Only a few yellow leaves clung to the branches, and every moment a leaf fluttered down. Here in this swale Pan caught the autumn smells, dank and woody.|$|R
60|$|Thirty {{miles of}} easy stages brought the fugitives to another waterhole, a little round pocket under the heaved-up edge of lava. There was spare, short, <b>bleached</b> <b>grass</b> for the horses, but no wood for a fire. This night there was {{question}} and reply, conjecture, doubt, opinion, and conviction {{expressed by the}} men of the party. But the Indian, who alone could have told where they were, where they were going, what chance they had to escape, maintained his stoical silence. Gale took the early watch, Ladd the midnight one, and Lash that of the morning.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked out}} {{through the open window}} at the prairie. It had grown green with the rain, though clumps of <b>bleached</b> <b>grass</b> still {{checkered}} it with silvery gray. Red lilies were opening here and there, and as she gazed the blue shadow of a cloud swept across the plain and vanished, leaving it bright with sunshine. Its vastness and the sense of freedom it conveyed appealed to the girl. There was a charm in the wide horizon; one never felt cramped upon the plains. She loved the spacious land, {{and did not want to}} live in England.|$|R
60|$|For {{a change}} Wildfire had climbed high up a slope of talus, {{through a narrow}} pass, rounded over with {{drifting}} sand. And Slone gazed down into a huge amphitheater full of monuments, like all that strange country. A basin three miles across lay beneath him. Walls and weathered slants of rock and steep slopes of reddish-yellow sand inclosed this oval depression. The floor was white, {{and it seemed to}} move gently or radiate with heat-waves. Studying it, Slone made out that the motion was caused by wind in long <b>bleached</b> <b>grass.</b> He had crossed small areas of this grass {{in different parts of the}} region.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not only}} a far country attained, but another, strange and beautiful. Siccane lay a white and green dot far over the purple sage. The golden-walled mesas stood up, black fringed against the blue. In the bold notches burned the red of autumn foliage. Valleys spread between the tablelands. There was room for a hundred homesteads. Pan's keen eye sighted only a few and they were farther on, green squares in the gray. Down toward Siccane cattle made tiny specks on the vast expanse. Square miles of <b>bleached</b> <b>grass</b> contended with the {{surrounding}} slopes of sage, sweeping with slow graceful rise up to the bases of the walls and mesas.|$|R
60|$|The picnic at Long Lake was {{an annual}} function, held {{as soon as}} the weather got warm enough, to {{celebrate}} the return of spring. Winter is long and tedious on the high Western plains, where the frost is often Arctic and little work can be done, and after sitting by the red-hot stove through the dark, cold months, the inhabitants of the scattered homesteads come out with joyful hearts to greet the sunshine. There is, however, no slow transition. Rushing winds from the North-west sweep the sky, the snow vanishes, and after a week or two, during which the prairie trails are impassable, the <b>bleached</b> <b>grass</b> dries and green blades and flowers spring from the steaming sod.|$|R
50|$|First, a black cap {{was worn}} {{to smooth the}} form and {{strengthen}} {{the shape of the}} head. This hat was worn at home when the woman was around an open fire. Next, a lace, tulle or gauze hat was worn. Then, the poffer was worn as an over-bonnet, either pinned to the hat at the front and or tied beneath the chin. To keep the soft fabric of the poffer in shape, starch with borax and white wax was used. The hat and poffer were detached for cleaning and washed in soft soap and then laid, still wet, on the <b>grass</b> to be <b>bleached</b> by the sun. Starch was used to keep the fabric from yellowing.|$|R
60|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} I slipped off down the canyon alone, taking Haught's rifle for safety rather than a desire to kill anything. By no means was it impossible to meet a bad bear in that forest. Some distance below camp I entered a ravine and climbed up to the level, and soon found myself deep in the fragrant, colorful, wild forest. Like coming home again was it to enter that forest of silver-tipped, level-spreading spruce, and great, gnarled, massive pines, and oak-patches of green and gold, and maple thickets, with shining aspens standing white against the blaze of red and purple. High, wavy, <b>bleached</b> <b>grass,</b> brown mats of pine needles, gray-green moss waving from the spruces, long strands of sunlight--all these seemed to welcome me.|$|R
6000|$|The Panhandle was {{a lonely}} purple range land, unfenced and wind swept. Bill Smith, cattleman, threw up a cabin {{and looked at}} the future with hopeful eyes. One day while plowing almost out of sight of his little home--which that morning he had left apprehensively owing to an {{impending}} event--he espied his wife Margaret coming {{along the edge of the}} plowed field. She had brought his lunch this day, despite his order to the contrary. Bill dropped the loop of his driving reins over the plow handle and strode toward her. Presently she halted wearily and sat down where the dark rich overturned earth met the line of <b>bleached</b> <b>grass.</b> Bill meant to scold Margaret for bringing his lunch, but it developed she had brought him something more. A son! ...|$|R
60|$|The riders soon {{struck the}} base of a long incline of rocky ground that led up to the slope of the {{foothill}}. Here rocks and gravel gave place to black cinders out of which grew a scant <b>bleached</b> <b>grass.</b> This desert verdure was what lent the soft gray shade to the foothill when seen from a distance. The slope was gentle, so that the ascent did not entail any hardship. Carley was amazed at the length of the slope, and also to see how high over the desert she was getting. She felt lifted out of a monotonous level. A green-gray league-long cedar forest extended down toward Oak Creek. Behind her the magnificent bulk of the mountains reached up into the stormy clouds, showing white slopes of snow under the gray pall.|$|R
60|$|I {{took down}} this {{dwelling}} the same morning, drawing the nails, and removed {{it to the}} pond-side by small cartloads, spreading the boards on the <b>grass</b> there to <b>bleach</b> and warp back again in the sun. One early thrush gave me a note or two as I drove along the woodland path. I was informed treacherously by a young Patrick that neighbor Seeley, an Irishman, in the intervals of the carting, transferred the still tolerable, straight, and drivable nails, staples, and spikes to his pocket, and then stood when I came back {{to pass the time}} of day, and look freshly up, unconcerned, with spring thoughts, at the devastation; there being a dearth of work, as he said. He was there to represent spectatordom, and help make this seemingly insignificant event one with the removal of the gods of Troy.|$|R
60|$|The sun cleared Coconina and shone warm on his back; the Pink Cliffs lifted {{higher and}} higher before him. From the ridge-tops he saw the black patch grow into cabins and corrals. As he neared the ranch he came into rolling pasture-land where the <b>bleached</b> <b>grass</b> shone white and the cattle were ranging in the thousands. This range had once belonged to Martin Cole, and Hare thought of the bitter Mormon as he noted the snug cabins for the riders, the rambling, picturesque ranch-house, the large corrals, and the long flume that ran down from the cliff. There was a corral full of shaggy horses, and another full of steers, and two lines of cattle, one going into a pond-corral, and one coming out. The air was gray with dust. A bunch of yearlings were licking at huge lumps of brown rock-salt. A wagonful of cowhides stood before the ranch-house.|$|R
60|$|He {{kept his}} resolve for a fortnight, and then, one morning, a man {{brought him a}} note from Wilkinson, asking him to drive over to the range. Charnock told the man he could not go, but {{presently}} put down his pen and looked out of the open window {{of the office of}} the store. The last of the snow had vanished some time since, and round white clouds drifted across the sky. Flying shadows streaked the wide plain, which gleamed like silver in the sunshine, and the <b>bleached</b> <b>grass</b> rolled in long waves before the breeze. There was something strangely exhilarating in the air and the dusty office smelt of salt-pork and cheese. It was a glorious day for a drive, he need not stay long at Wilkinson's, and the team needed exercise. Moreover, Sadie was not about and would not come home until afternoon; he might get back before her. He hesitated {{for a few minutes and}} then sent an order to the stable.|$|R
60|$|In the meanwhile, Agatha and Hawtrey {{found it}} almost as {{impossible}} {{to sustain a}} conversation, which was, on the whole, a relief to the girl. The string-patched trace still held, and the waggon pole was a new one, but where they were just then the white grass was tussocky and long, and the trail they occasionally plunged into to avoid it had been churned into a quagmire. Hawtrey had packed the thick driving robe high about his companion, and slipped one arm about her waist beneath it; but she was conscious that she rather suffered this than derived any satisfaction from it. She strove to assure herself that she was jaded with the journey, which was, in fact, the case, and that the lowering sky, and the cheerless waste they were crossing, had occasioned the dejection she felt, which was also possible. There was not a tree upon the vast sweep of <b>bleached</b> <b>grass</b> which ran all round her to the horizon. It was inexpressibly lonely, a lifeless desolation, with only the ploughed-up trail to show that man had ever traversed it; and the raw wind which swept it set her shivering.|$|R
60|$|In the meanwhile, Agatha and Hawtrey {{had found}} it almost {{impossible}} to sustain a conversation. It was a relief to the girl to be able to sit silent and observant beside the man whom she had promised to marry. The string-patched trace still held, and the wagon pole was a new one. The white grass was tussocky and long, and the trail here and there had been churned into quagmire.

6000|$|Hers always {{then the}} mutable and {{immutable}} desert, the leagues and leagues of slope and sage and rolling ridge, the great canyons {{and the giant}} cliffs, the dark river with its mystic thunder of waters, the pine-fringed plateaus, the endless stretch of horizon, with its lofty, isolated, noble monuments, and the bold ramparts with their beckoning beyond! Hers always the desert seasons: the shrill, icy blast, the intense cold, the steely skies, the fading snows; the gray old sage and the <b>bleached</b> <b>grass</b> under the pall of the spring sand-storms; the hot furnace breath of summer, with its magnificent cloud pageants in the sky, with the black tempests hanging here and there over the peaks, dark veils floating down and rainbows everywhere, and the lacy waterfalls upon the glistening cliffs and the thunder of the red floods; and the glorious golden autumn when it was always afternoon and time stood still! Hers always the rides in the open, with the sun at her back and the wind in her face! And hers surely, sooner or later, the nameless adventure which had its inception in the strange yearning of her heart and presaged its fulfilment somewhere down that trailless sage-slope she loved so well! ...|$|R
60|$|About noon {{that day}} Ellen Jorth {{arrived at the}} Knoll, which was the {{location}} of her father's ranch. Three canyons met there to form a larger one. The knoll was a symmetrical hill situated {{at the mouth of}} the three canyons. It was covered with brush and cedars, with here and there lichened rocks showing above the <b>bleached</b> <b>grass.</b> Below the Knoll was a wide, grassy flat or meadow through which a willow-bordered stream cut its rugged boulder-strewn bed. Water flowed abundantly at this season, and the deep washes leading down from the slopes attested to the fact of cloudbursts and heavy storms. This meadow valley was dotted with horses and cattle, and meandered away between the timbered slopes to lose itself in a green curve. A singular feature of this canyon was that a heavy growth of spruce trees covered the slope facing northwest; and the opposite slope, exposed to the sun and therefore less snowbound in winter, held a sparse growth of yellow pines. The ranch house of Colonel Jorth stood round the rough comer of the largest of the three canyons, and rather well hidden, it did not obtrude its rude and broken-down log cabins, its squalid surroundings, its black mud-holes of corrals upon the beautiful and serene meadow valley.|$|R
60|$|So {{far there}} had not really been any {{necessity}} for the completion of that sentence. But five miles of riding up into the cedar forest had convinced Carley that {{she might not have}} much farther to go. Spillbeans had ambled along well enough until he reached level ground where a long <b>bleached</b> <b>grass</b> waved in the wind. Here he manifested hunger, then a contrary nature, next insubordination, and finally direct hostility. Carley had urged, pulled, and commanded in vain. Then when she gave Spillbeans a kick in the flank he jumped stiff legged, propelling her up out of the saddle, and while she was descending he made the queer jump again, coming up to meet her. The jolt she got seemed to dislocate every bone in her body. Likewise it hurt. Moreover, along with her idea of what a spectacle she must have presented, it quickly decided Carley that Spillbeans was a horse that was not to be opposed. Whenever he wanted a mouthful of grass he stopped to get it. Therefore Carley was always in the rear, a fact which in itself did not displease her. Despite his contrariness, however, Spillbeans had apparently no intention of allowing the other horses to get completely out of sight.|$|R
60|$|Slone {{was packed}} and saddled {{and on his}} way before the sun reddened the canyon wall. He walked the horses. From time to time he saw signs of Wildfire's {{consistent}} progress. The canyon narrowed and the walls grew lower and the grass increased. There was a decided ascent all the time. Slone could find {{no evidence that the}} canyon had ever been traveled by hunters or Indians. The day was pleasant and warm and still. Every once in a while a little breath of wind would bring a fragrance of cedar and pinyon, and a sweet hint of pine and sage. At every turn he looked ahead, expecting to see the green of pine and the gray of sage. Toward the middle of the afternoon, coming to a place where Wildfire had taken to a trot, he put Nagger to that gait, and by sundown had worked up to where the canyon was only a shallow ravine. And finally it turned once more, to lose itself in a level where straggling pines stood high above the cedars, and great, dark-green silver spruces stood above the pines. And here were patches of sage, fresh and pungent, and long reaches of <b>bleached</b> <b>grass.</b> It was the edge of a forest. Wildfire's trail went on. Slone came at length to a group of pines, and here he found the remains of a camp-fire, and some flint arrow-heads. Indians had been in there, probably having come from the opposite direction to Slone's. This encouraged him, for where Indians could hunt so could he. Soon he was entering a forest where cedars and pinyons and pines began to grow thickly. Presently he came upon a faintly defined trail, just a dim, dark line even to an experienced eye. But it was a trail, and Wildfire had taken it.|$|R
60|$|The trail he {{followed}} {{appeared to be}} seldom traveled. It led, according to the meager information obtainable at the last settlement, directly to {{what was called the}} Rim, and from there Grass Valley could be seen down in the Basin. The ascent of the ground was so gradual that only in long, open stretches could it be seen. But the nature of the vegetation showed Jean how he was climbing. Scant, low, scraggy cedars gave place to more numerous, darker, greener, bushier ones, and these to high, full-foliaged, green-berried trees. Sage and grass in the open flats grew more luxuriously. Then came the pinyons, and presently among them the checker-barked junipers. Jean hailed the first pine tree with a hearty slap on the brown, rugged bark. It was a small dwarf pine struggling to live. The next one was larger, and after that came several, and beyond them pines stood up everywhere above the lower trees. Odor of pine needles mingled with the other dry smells that made the wind pleasant to Jean. In an hour from the first line of pines he had ridden beyond the cedars and pinyons into a slowly thickening and deepening forest. Underbrush appeared scarce except in ravines, and the ground in open patches held a <b>bleached</b> <b>grass.</b> Jean's eye roved for sight of squirrels, birds, deer, or any moving creature. It appeared to be a dry, uninhabited forest. About midday Jean halted at a pond of surface water, evidently melted snow, and gave his animals a drink. He saw a few old deer tracks in the mud and several huge bird tracks new to him which he concluded must have been made by wild turkeys.|$|R
60|$|Spring {{might have}} been fresh and keen in the air, but it had not yet brought much green to the brown earth or to the trees. The cotton-woods showed a light {{feathery}} verdure. The long <b>grass</b> was a <b>bleached</b> white, and low down close to the sod fresh tiny green blades showed. The great fern leaves were sear and ragged, and they rustled in the breeze. Small gray sheath-barked trees with clumpy foliage and snags of dead branches, Glenn called cedars; and, grotesque as these were, Carley rather liked them. They were approachable, not majestic and lofty like the pines, and they smelled sweetly wild, {{and best of all}} they afforded some protection from the bitter wind. Carley rested better than she walked. The huge sections of red rock that had tumbled from above also interested Carley, especially when the sun happened to come out for a few moments and brought out their color. She enjoyed walking on the fallen pines, with Glenn below, keeping pace with her and holding her hand. Carley looked in vain for flowers and birds. The only living things she saw were rainbow trout that Glenn pointed out to her in the beautiful clear pools. The way the great gray bowlders trooped down to the brook as if they were cattle going to drink; the dark caverns under the shelving cliffs, where the water murmured with such hollow mockery; the low spear-pointed gray plants, resembling century plants, and which Glenn called mescal cactus, each with its single straight dead stalk standing on high with fluted head; the narrow gorges, perpendicularly walled in red, where the constricted brook plunged in amber and white cascades over fall after fall, tumbling, rushing, singing its water melody--these all held singular appeal for Carley as aspects of the wild land, fascinating for the moment, symbolic of the lonely red man and his forbears, and by their raw contrast making more necessary and desirable and elevating the comforts and conventions of civilization. The cave man theory interested Carley only as mythology.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{discoveries of}} Voltaic electricity, electromagnetism, and {{magnetic}} electricity, by Volta, OErsted, and Faraday, {{led to the}} invention of electric telegraphy by Wheatstone and others, and to the great manufactures of telegraph cables and telegraph wire, and of the materials required for them. The value of the cargo of the Great Eastern alone in the recent Bombay telegraph expedition was calculated at three millions of pounds sterling. It also led to the employment of thousands of operators to transmit the telegraphic messages, and to a great increase of our commerce in nearly all its branches by the more rapid means of communication. The discovery of Voltaic electricity further led to the invention of electro-plating, and to the employment {{of a large number}} of persons in that business. [...] The numerous experimental researches on specific heat, latent heat, the tension of vapours, the properties of water, the mechanical effect of heat, etc., resulted in the development of steam-engines, and railways, and the almost endless employments depending upon their construction and use. About a quarter of a million of persons are employed on railways alone in Great Britain. The various original investigations on the chemical effects of light led to the invention of photography, and have given employment to thousands of persons who practise that process, or manufacture and prepare the various material and articles required in it. The discovery of chlorine by Scheele led to the invention of the modern processes of bleaching, and to various improvements in the dyeing of the textile fabrics, and has given employment to a very large number of our Lancashire operatives. The discovery of chlorine has also contributed to the employment of thousands of printers, by enabling Esparto <b>grass</b> to be <b>bleached</b> and formed into paper for the use of our daily press. The numerous experimental investigations in relation to coal-gas have been the means of extending the use of that substance, and of increasing the employment of workmen and others connected with its manufacture. The discovery of the alkaline metals by Davy, of cyanide of potassium, of nickel, phosphorus, the common acids, and a multitude of other substances, has led to the employment of a whole army of workmen in the conversion of those substances into articles of utility. The foregoing examples might be greatly enlarged upon, and a great many others might be selected from the sciences of physics and chemistry: but those mentioned will suffice. There is not a force of Nature, nor scarcely a material substance that we employ, which has not been the subject of several, and in some cases of numerous, original experimental researches, many of which have resulted, in a greater or less degree, in increasing the employment for workmen and others."
