25|$|A {{simpler and}} less {{expensive}} form of arsenic removal {{is known as the}} Sono arsenic filter, using three pitchers containing cast <b>iron</b> <b>turnings</b> and sand in the first pitcher and wood activated carbon and sand in the second. Plastic buckets can also be used as filter containers. It is claimed that thousands of these systems are in use and can last for years while avoiding the toxic waste disposal problem inherent to conventional arsenic removal plants. Although novel, this filter has not been certified by any sanitary standards such as NSF, ANSI, WQA and does not avoid toxic waste disposal similar to any other iron removal process.|$|E
50|$|This {{process was}} {{patented}} in 1891. In the original invention, bromide-containing brines {{are treated with}} sulfuric acid and bleaching powder to oxidize bromide to bromine, which remains dissolved in the water. The aqueous solution is dripped onto burlap, and water is blown through causing bromine to volatilize. Bromine is trapped with <b>iron</b> <b>turnings</b> to give a solution of ferric bromide. Treatment with more iron metal converted the ferric bromide to ferrous bromide via comproportionation. Where desired, free bromine may be obtained by thermal decomposition of ferrous bromide.|$|E

60|$|I {{think you}} can see a little in this way. We had just now the case of a {{substance}} which acted upon the water in the way that Sir Humphrey Davy shewed us[13], and which I am now going to recall to your minds by making again an experiment upon that dish. It is a thing which we have to handle very carefully, for you see, if I allow a little splash of water to come upon this mass, it sets fire to part of it; and if there were free access of air, it would quickly set fire to the whole. Now, this is a metal--a beautiful and bright metal--which rapidly changes in the air, and, as you know, rapidly changes in water. I will put a piece on the water, and you see it burns beautifully, making a floating lamp, using the water in the place of air. Again, if we take a few <b>iron</b> filings or <b>turnings,</b> and put them in water, we find that they likewise undergo an alteration. They do not change so much as this potassium does, but they change somewhat in the same way; they become rusty, and shew an action upon the water, though in a different degree of intensity to what this beautiful metal does: but they act upon the water in the same manner generally as this potassium. I want you to put these different facts together in your minds. I have another metal here [zinc], and when we examined it with regard to the solid substance produced by its combustion, we had an opportunity of seeing that it burned; and I suppose, if I take a little strip of this zinc and put it over the candle, you will see something half-way, as it were, between the combustion of potassium on the water and the action of iron,--you see there is a sort of combustion. It has burned, leaving a white ash or residuum, and here also we find that the metal has a certain amount of action upon water.|$|R
40|$|The Ayurvedic {{medicines}} are {{formulated by}} using plant, animal, metal and minerals. Conversion of metals and minerals into acceptable form i. e. bhasma {{is a unique}} technology of Ayurveda. Certain technical procedures like Sodhana, Marana (Incineration process) etc. will play {{a greater role in}} converting the material into acceptable form. GMP provides certain directions for processing these medicines in present day. Standard operative procedure, particularly for bhasma preparation has become mandatory for the standardization and quality control of bhasmas. By considering these views in present research work the different samples of lauha bhasma were prepared by using different raw materials viz. Magnetite iron ore, <b>iron</b> <b>turnings.</b> As per the description of Ayurveda, Kanta lauha (Magnetite iron ore) is considered as best raw material for lauha bhasma preparation. After this next best raw material for lauha bhasma preparation is Teekshna lauha (<b>iron</b> <b>turnings).</b> The availability of Kanta lauha (magnetite iron ore) is rare, hence in many Ayurvedic pharmaceutical industries, lauha bhasma is prepared by Teekshna lauha. In the present work a step is made to find out the best quality of lauha bhasma by preparing various samples of lauha bhasma. </span...|$|E
40|$|A three-pitcher (locally {{known as}} ‘ 3 -Kolshi’) water {{filtration}} system made from locally available materials was tested for its efficacy in removing arsenic, other trace metals and anions from the groundwater of Bangladesh and {{the disposal of}} the filtering materials after the breakthrough was studied. In this filter, the first Kolshi has cast <b>iron</b> <b>turnings,</b> and sand, the second Kolshi has wood charcoal and sand as the active ingredients. About 6000 L of groundwater containing 80 - 1900 µg/L of arsenic was filtered. The filtered water contained about 10 µg/L As(total), no detectable As(III), and significantly reduced major, minor and trace 172 Technologies for Arsenic Removal from Drinking Water metals. The filtration process was monitored for a year by measuring As (total), As(III), 23 other metals, 9 anions, pH, conductivity, temperature and flow rate. The complete conversion of Fe 0 to nonmagnetic hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) as the most active component for arsenic removal is indicative of an oxidizing environment sustained by continuous diffusion of air through the porous Kolshi. All parameters indicate that the water quality meets and exceeds USEPA, WHO, and Bangladesh standards. The effect of flow rate on arsenic removal has bee...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Acid mine waters {{can contain}} high {{concentrations}} of metals like iron, aluminum, zinc, uranium and heavy metals. Research has been conducted for several years to establish {{the extent to which}} under the conditions of the former uranium mine of Königstein (Saxony, Germany) reduction of pollutant concentrations can be positively influenced and accelerated by storage of reactive materials in open mine cavities. Experimental investigations ranging in scale from laboratory and underground column tests up to a flooded heading were conducted by WISMUT GmbH and DMT GmbH. Reactions induced by zero-valent iron form a basis for a further improvement of pollutant immobilization by additives. A mixture consisting of iron and lignite proved to be the most effective combination of materials. The structure of <b>iron</b> <b>turnings</b> and coarse brown coal remains stable in spite of partial dissolution and precipitation of reaction products. For periods of more than one year a sufficient reaction capacity without re-release could be verified. The conveyance of reactive materials can be regarded as practical for reducing pollutant loads in mine water in open mine cavities as a supporting measure to be taken during the controlled flooding and as a safety component afte...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} methodologies of {{ancient and modern}} medicinal science are different but objectives behind them remain the same. Hence in modern day combined practice of Ayurveda, the Indian traditional medicine, testing parameters using traditional and modern analytical methods is required for understanding the Ayurveda in most scientific manner. Iron is an important element for the body system in ancient ayurveda the selection of best iron source and the processing technology to prepared lauha bhasma is more appropriate {{but there is a}} need to explain the changes taken place during process of bhasma by using most shofisticted analytical technology hence in present study the analysis of lauh bhasma was done by performing Loss on drying, Determination of Ash value, Determination of Acid insoluble, SEM and, EDAX Analysis,FTIR Analysis and there results has been incorporated in present study. herefore, the present study is taken up to prepare Lauha Bhasma by using different raw materials i. e. tikshna and kanta lauha. and characterization of lauha bhsma by using traditional parameters as well as modern techniques and there result has been included in present study. The major finding of present study is Scanning electron microscopy along with EDX and FTIR studies proved the conversion of the two starting material viz. <b>iron</b> <b>turnings</b> and magnetite ore (Fe 3 O 4) into a mixture of α-Fe 2 O 3 and γ- Fe 2 O 3 along with oxides of some trace elements...|$|E
