Landing at 04:30, the group made quick progress through the beach and dunes, secured the small city of Thé Chi Dong and hit the north coast of the lagoon by 05:30, thereby sealing off that <b>escape</b> <b>route</b> with no enemy contact. The final act of sealing the noose was to move some of the French Navy vessels north to the Vietnamese villages of Ba-Lang and An-Hoi where any attempt by Regiment 95 to flee by sea would have taken place.|$|E

40|$|If an {{undesired}} event occurs is {{the possibility}} of escape of crucial importance for the safety of passengers and crew. It is therefore important to have good solutions on escape routes; in this matter is the design and orientation of <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> essential. If an emergency situation occurs and the <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> are insufficient, may this result in difficulties for passengers to escape from the area in an effective and successfully matter. An offshore development can never be completely safe, but by selecting the optimum design may the risk be reduced to a level that is as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP). However, this requires identification of risk contributors and their assessment, which should be done by using QRA techniques early in the project life cycle (Khan & Amyotte, 2002). It is uncertain to which degree the <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> are prioritized, evaluated and considered in such a process, and if it is the best practice used. This is due to that there are few requirements regarding how <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> should be evaluated in a risk analysis in the legislations. This thesis evaluates how <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> are taken into account in two different risk analyses. This is done by the use of five success criterias; clear description of the installation, simulations, calculations, assumptions and uncertainties. The discussion indicated that there were improvement potentials for how to evaluate <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> in the risk analysis in order to reach a robust solution. The thesis also discusses whether the requirements to design are sufficient to reach robust <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> solutions, or not. Some of the requirements regarding <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> could be interpreted in different ways, and should have more explanations and guidelines...|$|R

40|$|Several {{sulfur hexafluoride}} (SF 6) tracer gas {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} a subway system to measure the possible pathways of toxic gas for subway tunnels and stations empirically. A new mobile integrated measuring and analysis system was used to achieve high sample rates and a long measurement time. Due to the mobility of the sensors, tracer gas experiments were also carried out inside running subway coaches. All experiments showed a common pattern: the pathways of tracer gas dispersion overlapped with some <b>escape</b> <b>routes,</b> which were contaminated within a few minutes. So in case of catastrophic circumstances like terrorist attacks or subway fires, some <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> will become deathly traps, but the results also showed free <b>escape</b> <b>routes.</b> With the new sensor technique {{it will be possible}} to conduct safety assessments for <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> in underground transportation facilities...|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{successful}} morning attack, {{access to an}} open <b>escape</b> <b>route,</b> and to the amazement of Floyd and Buckner, Pillow ordered his men back to their trenches by 1:30p.m. Buckner confronted Pillow, and Floyd intended to countermand the order, but Pillow argued that his men needed to regroup and resupply before evacuating the fort. Pillow won the argument. Floyd also believed that C. F. Smith's division was being heavily reinforced, so the entire Confederate force was ordered back inside the lines of Fort Donelson, giving up the ground they gained earlier that day.|$|E

It was operated by Cambria Iron Company and its successor Bethlehem Steel until 1935, when it was sold to the borough of Westmont. The incline was briefly shut down in 1962 when its supply of power from Bethlehem Steel was terminated. Twice in its history, the Johnstown Inclined Plane fulfilled its role as a means of evacuation from floodsonce in 1936 and again in 1977. The incline was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 1994.

5|$|During the 1850s, Utica {{was known}} to aid more than 650 {{fugitive}} slaves; it {{played a major role}} as a station in the Underground Railroad. The city was on a slave <b>escape</b> <b>route</b> from the Southern Tier to Canada by way of Albany, Syracuse and Rochester. The route, used by Harriet Tubman to travel to Buffalo, guided slaves to pass through Utica on the New York Central Railroad right-of-way en route to Canada. Utica was the locus for Methodist preacher Orange Scott's antislavery sermons during the 1830s and 1840s, and Scott formed an abolitionist group there in 1843. Despite efforts by local abolitionists, pro-slavery riots and mobs, who wanted to protect the cotton mills, forced many abolitionist meetings to other cities.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{an evolutionary}} conserved gene silencing mechanism that mediates the sequence-specific breakdown of target mRNAs. RNAi {{can be used}} to inhibit HIV- 1 replication by targeting the viral RNA genome. However, the error-prone replication machinery of HIV- 1 can generate RNAi-resistant variants with specific mutations in the target sequence. For durable inhibition of HIV- 1 replication the emergence of such escape viruses must be controlled. Here we present a strategy that anticipates HIV- 1 escape by designing 2 nd generation short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that form a complete match with the viral escape sequences. Results To block the two favorite viral <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> observed when the HIV- 1 integrase gene sequence is targeted, the original shRNA inhibitor was combined with two 2 nd generation shRNAs in a single lentiviral expression vector. We demonstrate in long-term viral challenge experiments that the two dominant viral <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> were effectively blocked. Eventually, virus breakthrough did however occur, but HIV- 1 evolution was skewed and forced to use new <b>escape</b> <b>routes.</b> Conclusion These results demonstrate the power of the 2 nd generation RNAi concept. Popular viral <b>escape</b> <b>routes</b> are blocked by the 2 nd generation RNAi strategy. As a consequence viral evolution was skewed leading to new <b>escape</b> <b>routes.</b> These results are of importance for a deeper understanding of HIV- 1 evolution under RNAi pressure. </p...|$|R
