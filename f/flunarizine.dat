5000|$|As of 2014, no {{clinical}} trials had {{been conducted to}} determine what treatments are safe and effective; a few case reports had been published describing treatment of small numbers of people (two to twelve per report) with clomipramine, <b>flunarizine,</b> nifedipine, topiramate, carbamazepine, methylphenidate.

5000|$|Beyond an anti-vertigo treatment, {{cinnarizine}} {{could be}} also {{viewed as a}} nootropic drug because of its vasorelaxating abilities (due to calcium channel blockage), which happen mostly in brain {{and the fact that}} it is also used as a labyrinthine sedative. Cinnarizine inhibits the flow of calcium into red blood cells, which increases the elasticity of the cell wall, thereby increasing their flexibility and making the blood less viscous. This allows the blood to travel more efficiently and effectively through narrowed vessels in order to bring oxygen to damaged tissue. It is also effectively combined with other nootropics, primarily piracetam; in such combination each drug potentiates the other in boosting brain oxygen supply. [...] An animal study comparing the effectiveness of cinnarizine and <b>flunarizine</b> (a derivative of cinnarizine that is 2.5-15 times stronger [...] for treatment of transient global cerebral ischemia, it was found that cinnarizine helped to improve the functional abnormalities of ischemia, but did not help with damage to the neurons. <b>Flunarizine,</b> on the other hand, offered more neuronal protection, but was less effective in treating subsequent behavioral changes.|$|E
5000|$|While some calcium-channel blockers, such as <b>flunarizine,</b> {{act on the}} dopaminergic system, {{lomerizine}} is {{ineffective in}} vivo at inhibiting the release of dopamine.

[...] While researchers are unsure of the reason for this difference, one hypothesis is that the doses administered cannot reach a high enough concentration in the brain to affect D2 receptors.|$|E
50|$|Red ear {{syndrome}} {{has proven}} difficult to treat.

Appropriate medication may differ depending on the underlying cause of the individual's symptoms. Using an ice pack to cool the ear during an attack can provide relief.|$|E
50|$|Experts {{differ in}} their {{confidence}} in flunarizine's effectiveness. Some studies have {{found it to be}} very effective in reducing the duration, severity, and frequency of hemiplegic attacks. It is generally considered the best treatment available, but this drug is thought by some to be of little benefit to AHC patients. Many patients suffer adverse effects without seeing any improvement. <b>Flunarizine</b> also causes problems because it is difficult for patients to obtain, as it is not readily available in the United States.|$|E
50|$|There {{were many}} {{potential}} therapies around which might achieve neural rescue, {{and most of}} these workers did not immediately move to hypothermia. Magnesium was an appealingly simple excitoxin receptor antagonist that protected cells in culture: the Reynolds group tested it in their piglet model without success. Gluckman and Gunn started by looking unsuccessfully at <b>flunarizine,</b> a calcium entry inhibitor. Edwards picked on nitric oxide synthase inhibition which was also a failure. Gluckman had success with his innovative studies of IGF-1, but could not immediately translate this to clinical practice.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{therapeutics}} used clinically {{which can}} effect {{the activity of}} P-type calcium channels. However, the primary target of these therapeutics are not thought to be P-type channels. For example, calcium antagonists, which are used to treat coronary heart disease, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmia, act by inhibiting L-type or T-type calcium channels. Some of these calcium antagonists include verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, benidipine, cilnidipine, nicardipine, and barnidipine. Although their main target is not P-type channels, these calcium antagonists also act to block the function of P-type channels. Moreover, <b>flunarizine</b> is another calcium antagonist {{which is used to}} treat migraines. Its main targets are voltage-gated calcium channels and sodium channels. <b>Flunarizine</b> inhibits the P-type channels that are located in the neocortical slices. It works to inhibit the inward flux of calcium. The migraines that it helps to prevent are due to mutations within the [...] "cacna1a" [...] gene of the P-type channel subunit. Also, compounds that block P-type channels are shown to help with seizures. Epileptic seizures are caused by increased neurotransmission, which is partially a result of P-type channels. Compounds such as levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine are known to block the P-type channels, which have helped to decrease the occurrence of seizures. Overall, there are various non-selective calcium channel blockers that help alleviate symptoms of hypertension, schizophrenia, cardiac arrhythmia, epilepsy, pain, asthma, bradycardia, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease. Although many of the therapeutic compounds' main target is not P-type channels, further research needs to determine if the clinical effects of these compounds are also influenced by the P-type channel blockage.|$|E
50|$|Examples {{of drugs}} {{commonly}} associated with depressogenic effects include some anticonvulsants such as the barbiturates (e.g. phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam), vigabatrin, and topiramate, corticosteroids like dexamethasone and prednisone, cytokines like interferon-α and interleukin-2, certain antihypertensives such as amiodarone, clonidine, methyldopa, reserpine, and tetrabenazine (used as an antipsychotic/antihyperkinetic), and agents with antiandrogen, antiestrogen, and/or anti-neurosteroid activities such as GnRH agonists (e.g., leuprolide, goserelin), anastrozole (an aromatase inhibitor), finasteride (a 5α-reductase inhibitor), and clomiphene (a SERM), {{as well as others}} including <b>flunarizine,</b> mefloquine, and efavirenz. Another notable agent is rimonabant, a cannabinoid receptor antagonist marketed as an anti-obesity agent which was withdrawn shortly after its introduction due to the incidence of severe psychiatric side effects associated with its use including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.|$|E
5000|$|Hypnic {{headaches}} are benign primary headaches {{that affect}} the elderly, with {{the average age of}} onset being 63 ± 11 years.

5000|$|Cinnarizine is {{also known}} to cause acute and chronic parkinsonism due to its {{affinity}} for D2 receptors, which strongly counter-suggests its actual usefulness for improving neurohealth.

40|$|Ameliorated by Flunarizine* Aim: In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} intracerebroventricular-injected iron neurotoxicity on {{the total number of}} cerebellar Purkinje cells in rats and the possible neuroprotective effect of <b>flunarizine,</b> a piperazine-derived calcium channel blocker. Materials and Methods: Rats were divided into four groups: control, <b>flunarizine,</b> iron, and iron + <b>flunarizine</b> groups. Rats in the iron and iron + <b>flunarizine</b> groups received intracerebro-ventricular iron (FeCl 36 H 2 O, 200 mM, 2. 5 μl), while those in <b>flunarizine</b> and iron + <b>flunarizine</b> groups were intraperitoneally injected with <b>flunarizine</b> (10 mg/kg/day) once a day after the operation for 10 days. After 10 days, all rats were perfused intracardially and then sacrificed. Brain tissues were removed and standard histological techniques were performed. The total numbers of Purkinje cells were estimated using unbiased stereological techniques. Results: Means of the total numbers of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum were estimated as 310441 ± 6558, 298658 ± 9636, 200201 ± 6822 and 282658 ± 6327 in the control, <b>flunarizine,</b> iron, and iron + <b>flunarizine</b> groups, respectively.

40|$|<b>Flunarizine,</b> a calcium {{antagonist}} {{widely used in}} the prophylactic treatment of migraine, may interfere with dopaminergic systems. <b>Flunarizine</b> therapy can in fact induce extrapyramidal side effects and can increase basal as well as stimulated prolactin levels.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Some of the {{excitatory}} neurotransmitters including glutamate {{have been}} suggested {{to be involved in}} headache pathophysiology. To our knowledge, {{there is a lack of}} publication about <b>flunarizine</b> efficacy in chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) treatments and the roles of glutamate in CTTH pathophysiology. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the <b>flunarizine</b> effect on serum levels of glutamate and its correlation with headache intensity based on the Numeric Rating Scale for pain (NRS) scores in CTTH patients. METHOD: In a prospective randomised, double-blind study with pre and post-test design, seventy-three CTTH patients were randomly allocated with <b>flunarizine</b> 5 mg, <b>flunarizine</b> 10 mg and amitriptyline 12. 5 mg groups. The serum levels of glutamate and NRS scores were measured before and after 15 -day treatment. RESULTS: <b>Flunarizine</b> 5 mg was more effective than <b>flunarizine</b> 10 mg and amitriptyline 12. 5 mg in reducing serum glutamate levels, whereas amitriptyline 12. 5 mg was the most effective in reducing headache intensity. There was found nonsignificant, but very weak negative correlation between headache intensity and serum glutamate levels after <b>flunarizine</b> 5 mg administration (r = - 0. 062; P = 0. 385), nonsignificant very weak negative correlation after <b>flunarizine</b> 10 mg administration (r = - 0. 007; P = 0. 488) and there was found a significant moderate positive correlation (r = 0. 508; P = 0. 007) between headache intensity and serum glutamate levels after amitriptyline 12. 5 mg administration. CONCLUSION: Since there was no significant correlation found between serum glutamate and headache intensity after treatment with <b>flunarizine,</b> it is suggested that decreasing of headache intensity after <b>flunarizine</b> treatment occurred not through glutamate pathways in CTTH patients...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Rationale: <b>Flunarizine</b> {{is known}} as a calcium channel blocker {{commonly}} used in many countries to treat migraine and vertigo. Parkinsonism has been described as one of its side-effects in the elderly, which is in agreement with its recently characterized moderate D 2 receptor antagonism. Objectives: To perform a pre-clinical evaluation of <b>flunarizine</b> as a potential antipsychotic. Methods: We evaluated the action of orally administered <b>flunarizine</b> in mice against hyperlocomotion induced by amphetamine and dizocilpine (MK- 801) as pharmacolo-gical models of schizophrenia, induction of catalepsy as a measure for extrapyramidal symptoms and impairment induced by dizocilpine on the delayed alternation task for working memory. Results: <b>Flunarizine</b> robustly inhibited hyperlocomotion induced by both amphetamine and dizocilpine at doses that do not reduce spontaneous locomotion (3 – 30 mg/kg). Mild catalepsy was observed at 30 mg/kg, being more pronounced at 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg. <b>Flunarizine</b> (30 mg/kg) improved dizocilpine-induced impairment on the delayed alternation test. Conclusions: These results suggest a profile comparable to atypical antipsychotics. The low cost, good tolerability and long half-life (over 2 weeks) of <b>flunarizine</b> are possible advantages for its use as an atypical antipsychot-ic. These results warrant clinical trials with <b>flunarizine</b> for the treatment of schizophrenia...|$|E
