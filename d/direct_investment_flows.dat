These international financial flows determine the traders who take part at the world’s economy to know to adopt a specific management in the international affairs field. We are viewers of an unprecedented expansion of foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investments.</b> The main objective of the paper is to analyze the foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investments</b> <b>flows</b> in Black Sea Economic Cooperation. This study is based on UNCTAD reports and on an econometrical model which gives us the possibility to create different analysis concerning FDI flow in this cooperation. So we defined a simple regression model, in which the dependent variable is represented by Nominal and real GDP, total and per capita, variable explicated by FDI flows, using as method the Least Squared, including 19 observations. Through this paper, we tried to illustrate the relation between the FDI flows and the economic growth rate in the past years inRomania, member of Black Sea Economic region. In line with a general upward trend in FDI to Central and Eastern Europe, inward FDI to the Russian Federation held steady between 1998 and 2001, at an annual average of $ 2. 8 billion. In Black Sea Economic region, Russian average is the biggest one, Russia being a leader country in warding FDI. The Russian Federation is by far the leading investor country in the region, accounting for more than 75 % of its annual outflows. Inward and outward <b>direct</b> <b>investments</b> <b>flows</b> in Russia have reached in 2009 an amount of $ 38, 722 billion. In Romania, following years of stagnation at very low levels, 1991 to 1997, FDI flows reached $ 1. 1 billion in 2002. Inflows to Bulgaria peaked at $ 1 billion in 2000; the surge is largely due to flows from developed countries. Inward and outward <b>direct</b> <b>investments</b> <b>flows</b> in Romania has reached the highest level in 2008, when the total amount was $ 13, 909 billion, in 2009, the world crisis, has influenced the trends in Romania, so the flows have reached only $ 6, 329 billion.

Empirically, it has been observed that foreign <b>direct</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>flows</b> demonstrate a high level of congruity with damestic import-export trade structures. German Companies with high levels of foreign direct investment also rank high in exports, thus offering evidence supporting the complementary nature of these investments.

Still researchers {{will continue to}} use regression approaches to analyze this volatility. This paper is an exploratory approach to analyzing the behavior of FDI with no attempt to design a complete regression model. Our approach is probabilistic in that we treat the FDI flows from home or source country to various members of ASEAN as random independent events over the time period 1999 - 2003 and over ISIC manufacturing sectors. We then show how closely the random plots of FDI fit two common cumulative distribution functions (CDF), the Gumbel and the Weibull and whether the plots are from multi-regimes or not. A brief econometric analysis shows FDI volatility within the ISIC industrial sectors. The essential thesis (or hypothesis) is that if capital markets are in a general equilibrium across hosts, home, industrial sectors, and time, then the return on capital (the marginal efficiency of capital) is equalized everywhere, and a home investor’s dollar will be randomly allocated across hosts, industrial sectors, and time.
