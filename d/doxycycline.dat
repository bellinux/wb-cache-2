5|$|There are {{a number}} of drugs that can help prevent or {{interrupt}} malaria in travelers to places where infection is common. Many of these drugs are also used in treatment. Chloroquine may be used where chloroquine-resistant parasites are not common. In places where Plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications, three medications—mefloquine (Lariam), <b>doxycycline</b> (available generically), or the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone)—are frequently used when prophylaxis is needed. <b>Doxycycline</b> and the atovaquone plus proguanil combination are the best tolerated; mefloquine is associated with death, suicide, and neurological and psychiatric symptoms.|$|E
5|$|If a chest tube {{is already}} in place, various agents may be instilled through the tube to achieve {{chemical}} pleurodesis, such as talc, tetracycline, minocycline or <b>doxycycline.</b> Results of chemical pleurodesis tend to be worse than when using surgical approaches, but talc pleurodesis {{has been found to}} have few negative long-term consequences in younger people.|$|E
5|$|The group {{searching for}} Sophia {{returns to the}} highway, where Daryl reveals {{that he has a}} bag {{containing}} painkillers and <b>doxycycline</b> antibiotics that T-Dog can take. Shane and Otis retrieve the supplies, but are spotted by walkers. The two {{have no choice but to}} barricade themselves in the high school.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{was used}} for the identification of antibiotic drugs such as: eight β-lactam (ampicillin sodium, penicillin G procaine, cefalexin, ampicillin trihydrate, benzathine penicillin, benzylpenicillin sodium, cefotaxime sodium, Ceftriaxone sodium), three tetracycline (<b>doxycycline</b> hydrochloride, oxytetracycline dehydrate, tetracycline hydrochloride) and two macrolide (azithromycin, erythromycin estolate) antibiotic drugs. Each of these drugs has a unique XRD pattern that makes their identification possible.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the disease include not having sex or having few sexual {{partners}} and using condoms. Screening women at risk for chlamydial infection followed by treatment decreases the risk of PID. If the diagnosis is suspected, treatment is typically advised. Treating a woman's sexual partners should also occur. In those with mild or moderate symptoms a single injection of the antibiotic ceftriaxone along with two weeks of <b>doxycycline</b> and possibly metronidazole by mouth is recommended. For {{those who do not}} improve after three days or who have severe disease intravenous antibiotics should be used.|$|E
5|$|The risk {{of sexual}} {{transmission}} of syphilis {{can be reduced}} by using a latex condom. Syphilis can be effectively treated with antibiotics. The preferred antibiotic for most cases is benzathine penicillin G injected into a muscle. In {{those who have a}} severe penicillin allergy, <b>doxycycline</b> or tetracycline may be used. In those with neurosyphilis, intravenous penicillin G potassium or ceftriaxone is recommended. During treatment people may develop fever, headache, and muscle pains, a reaction known as Jarisch-Herxheimer.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} {{applied to the}} skin or taken orally to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of antibiotics for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective, especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical erythromycin. Commonly used antibiotics, either applied to the skin or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as <b>doxycycline</b> and minocycline. When antibiotics are applied to the skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical antibiotics, and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use together.|$|E
5|$|The risk {{of disease}} {{can be reduced}} by {{preventing}} mosquito bites {{through the use of}} mosquito nets and insect repellents, or with mosquito control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water. Several medications are available to prevent malaria in travellers to areas where the disease is common. Occasional doses of the combination medication sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine are recommended in infants and after the first trimester of pregnancy in areas with high rates of malaria. Despite a need, no effective vaccine exists, although efforts to develop one are ongoing. The recommended treatment for malaria is a combination of antimalarial medications that includes an artemisinin. The second medication may be either mefloquine, lumefantrine, or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Quinine along with <b>doxycycline</b> may be used if an artemisinin is not available. It is recommended that in areas where the disease is common, malaria is confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing drug resistance. Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications; for example, chloroquine-resistant P.falciparum has spread to most malarial areas, and resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxycycline</b> is {{available}} worldwide under many brand names. <b>Doxycycline</b> {{is available}} as a generic medicine and is generally inexpensive. The wholesale cost is between 0.01 and 0.04 USD per pill.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxycycline</b> may {{be given}} {{alongside}} the primary therapy of scaling (see § initial therapy). <b>Doxycycline</b> {{has been shown to}} improve indicators of disease progression (namely probing depth and attachment level). Its mechanism of action involves inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (such as collagenase), which degrade the teeth's supporting tissues (periodontium) under inflammatory conditions. To avoid killing beneficial oral microbes, only small doses of <b>doxycycline</b> (20mg) are used.|$|E
25|$|Common {{antibiotic}} treatments include: tetracycline (<b>doxycycline)</b> (all tetracyclines, including <b>doxycycline,</b> are contraindicated {{during pregnancy}} and in children due to effects on bone development and tooth discoloration), and erythromycin. Azithromycin {{is also a}} drug of choice in LGV.|$|E
25|$|Both {{minocycline}} and <b>doxycycline</b> {{have shown}} effectiveness in asthma due to immune suppressing effects. Minocycline {{as well as}} <b>doxycycline</b> have modest effectiveness in treating rheumatoid arthritis. However, the 2015 American College of Rheumatology guideline {{for the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis does not include minocycline.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxycycline</b> {{kills the}} {{symbiotic}} Wolbachia {{bacteria in the}} reproductive tracts of parasitic filarial nematodes, making the nematodes sterile, and thus reducing transmission of diseases such as onchocerciasis and elephantiasis. Field trials in 2005 showed an eight-week course of <b>doxycycline</b> almost completely eliminates the release of microfilariae.|$|E
25|$|Antibiotics are {{the primary}} treatment. The {{specific}} approach to their use {{is dependent on the}} individual affected and the stage of the disease. For most people with early localized infection, oral administration of <b>doxycycline</b> is widely recommended as the first choice, as it is effective against not only Borrelia bacteria but also a variety of other illnesses carried by ticks. <b>Doxycycline</b> is contraindicated in children younger than eight years of age and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; alternatives to <b>doxycycline</b> are amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and azithromycin. Individuals with early disseminated or late infection may have symptomatic cardiac disease, refractory Lyme arthritis, or neurologic symptoms like meningitis or encephalitis. Intravenous administration of ceftriaxone is recommended as the first choice in these cases; cefotaxime and <b>doxycycline</b> are available as alternatives.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxycycline</b> {{may also}} be used as {{adjunctive}} therapy for severe acne.|$|E
25|$|Or <b>Doxycycline</b> (100mg PO aid)for {{those being}} {{allergic}} to penicillin.|$|E
25|$|Previously, <b>doxycycline</b> was {{believed}} to impair the effectiveness of many types of hormonal contraception due to CYP450 induction. Recent research has shown no significant loss of effectiveness in oral contraceptives while using most tetracycline antibiotics (including <b>doxycycline),</b> although many physicians still recommend the use of barrier contraception for people taking the drug to prevent unwanted pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|An {{erythematous}} rash in sun-exposed {{parts of}} the body has been reported to occur in 7.3–21.2% of persons taking <b>doxycycline</b> for malaria prophylaxis. One study examined the tolerability of various malaria prophylactic regimens and found <b>doxycycline</b> did not cause a significantly higher percentage of all skin events (photosensitivity not specified) when compared with other antimalarials. The rash resolves upon discontinuation of the drug.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxycycline</b> is an {{antibiotic}} {{that is used}} in the treatment of a number of types of infections caused by bacteria and protozoa. It is useful for bacterial pneumonia, acne, chlamydia infections, early Lyme disease, cholera and syphilis. It is also useful for the treatment of malaria when used with quinine and for the prevention of malaria. <b>Doxycycline</b> can be used either by mouth or intravenously.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxycycline</b> is {{categorized}} by the FDA {{as a class}} D drug in pregnancy. As with all tetracycline antibiotics, it is contraindicated in pregnancy through infancy and childhood up to eight years of age, due to the potential for disrupting bone and tooth development. Therefore, <b>doxycycline</b> should not be administered to {{children under the age}} of eight except in the treatment of anthrax or where other medications are contraindicated or ineffective.|$|E
25|$|In chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease, <b>doxycycline</b> {{has been}} shown to improve lung functions in patients with stable symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} ACT {{is based on}} the level of {{resistance}} to the constituents in the combination. Artemisinin and its derivatives are not appropriate for monotherapy. As second-line antimalarial treatment, when initial treatment does not work, an alternative ACT known to be effective in the region is recommended, such as artesunate plus tetracycline or <b>doxycycline</b> or clindamycin, and quinine plus tetracycline or <b>doxycycline</b> or clindamycin. Any of these combinations is to be given for 7 days. For pregnant women, the recommended first-line treatment during the first trimester is quinine plus clindamycin for 7 days. Artesunate plus clindamycin for 7 days is indicated if this treatment fails. For travellers returning to nonendemic countries, atovaquone/proguanil, artemether/lumefantrineany and quinine plus <b>doxycycline</b> or clindamycin are recommended.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxycycline,</b> {{like other}} {{tetracycline}} antibiotics, is bacteriostatic. It works by preventing bacteria from reproducing through the inhibition of protein synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Their {{most common}} current use {{is in the}} {{treatment}} of moderately severe acne and rosacea (tetracycline, oxytetracycline, <b>doxycycline</b> or minocycline).|$|E
25|$|Expired {{tetracyclines}} or tetracyclines {{allowed to}} stand at a pH less than 2 are reported to be nephrotoxic due {{to the formation of}} a degradation product, anhydro-4-epitetracycline causing Fanconi syndrome. In the case of <b>doxycycline,</b> the absence of a hydroxyl group in C-6 prevents the formation of the nephrotoxic compound. Nevertheless, tetracyclines and <b>doxycycline</b> itself have to be taken with precaution in patients with kidney injury, as they can worsen azotemia due to catabolic effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{first-line}} {{for treatment}} brucellosis is combination of <b>doxycycline</b> and streptomycin and the second-line is combination of doxyxycline and rifampicin (rifampin).|$|E
25|$|In Canada in 2004 <b>doxycycline</b> was {{considered}} a first-line treatment for chlamydia and non-gonococcal urethritis and with cefixime for uncomplicated gonorrhea.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{inflammatory}} lung diseases (panbronchiolitis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchitis). Both <b>doxycycline</b> and minocycline {{have shown}} effectiveness in asthma due to immune suppressing effects.|$|E
25|$|Antibiotics improve {{outcomes}} {{in those who}} are both severely and not severely dehydrated. Azithromycin and tetracycline may work better than <b>doxycycline</b> or ciprofloxacin.|$|E
25|$|There is no vaccine. Prevention {{depends on}} good {{maintenance}} of water systems. Treatment of Legionnaires' disease is with antibiotics. Recommended agents include fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, or <b>doxycycline.</b>|$|E
25|$|Medications {{with good}} {{evidence}} include ivermectin and azelaic acid creams and brimonidine, <b>doxycycline,</b> and isotretinoin by mouth. Lesser evidence supports metronidazole cream and tetracycline by mouth.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some other}} members of the {{tetracycline}} group, it may be used in those with renal impairment. <b>Doxycycline</b> is contraindicated in the pediatric treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxycycline</b> was {{patented}} in 1957 {{and came}} into commercial use in 1967. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Doxycycline</b> is available as a generic medicine and is generally inexpensive. The wholesale cost in the developing world is between 0.01 and 0.04 USD per pill. In the United States 10 days of treatment is about 14 USD, however some in 2014 were selling it for more than 3.00 to 10.00 USD per pill.|$|E
25|$|At subantimicrobial doses, <b>doxycycline</b> is an {{inhibitor}} of matrix metalloproteases, and {{has been}} used in various experimental systems for this purpose, such as for recalcitrant recurrent corneal erosions.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of <b>doxycycline</b> with dairy, antacids, calcium supplements, iron products, and laxatives containing magnesium is not inherently dangerous, but {{any of these}} foods and supplements may decrease doxycycline's effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|After {{exposure}} to B. pseudomallei (particularly following a laboratory accident) combined treatment with co-trimoxazole and <b>doxycycline</b> is recommended. Trovafloxacin and grepafloxacin {{have been shown}} to be effective in animal models.|$|E
