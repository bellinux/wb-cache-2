40|$|It {{is common}} to find soluble salts, {{generally}} chlorides and/or sulphates, among the atmospherical corrosion products when steel has been exposed {{for some time to}} atmospheres contaminated with Cl- and/or SO 2. In field studies, these salts are found heterogeneously distributed throughout the rust, accumulating preferentially in the innermost corrosion product layers. However, in laboratory studies, which have tried to simulate this surface condition of contaminated steel for different purposes (for instance, to study the effect of the presence of soluble salts at the steel/ paint interface), the specimens used have consisted of initially clean steel substrates contaminated with the desired levels of soluble salts by even dosing over the metallic surface. This situation is thus significantly different (in terms of the absence of rust and uniform distribution of salts) to that occurs naturally in the atmosphere. In an attempt to approximate more closely to what happens in the atmosphere, the present work has established a methodology using accelerated corrosion cabinets to produce corrosion products containing similar levels of chlorides and sulphates to those found on steel surfaces in natural conditions. The results obtained show that by varying the exposure time in a salt fog cabinet (in the case of chlorides) and the volume of SO 2 introduced in a <b>Kesternich</b> <b>cabinet</b> (in the case of sulphates), it is possible to form corrosion products with similar contents of these salts to those formed naturally during 3 months of exposure to three atmospheres of different aggressivity in Spain, located at Cabo Vilano (marine), Avilés (industrial) and Madrid (urban). © 2006 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

40|$|The {{presence}} of soluble salts, especially chlorides and sulphates, at the metal/paint interface usually causes premature {{deterioration of the}} paint system. In practice, soluble salts are found heterogeneously distributed in the steel corrosion products layer and are frequently located at the base steel/rust layer interface. However, {{in most of the}} research studies carried out with the aim of establishing critical concentration levels for different paint systems, panels have been prepared by dosing the saline contaminant in an uniform way across flat and unrusted steel surfaces. In order to resolve this problem, an attempt has been made to reproduce the atmospheric corrosion process of steel in environments contaminated with SO 2 and Cl-, using a salt fog cabinet for the case of chlorides, and a <b>Kesternich</b> type <b>cabinet</b> for sulphates.
