40|$|The {{degree and}} nature of patient {{involvement}} <b>in</b> <b>consultations</b> with health professionals influences problem and needs recognition and management, and public accountability. This paper suggests a framework for understanding the scope for patient involvement <b>in</b> such <b>consultations.</b> Patients are defined as co-producers of formal health services, whose potential for involvement <b>in</b> <b>consultations</b> depends on their personal rights, responsibilities and preferences. Patients' rights <b>in</b> <b>consultations</b> are poorly defined and, in the National Health Service (NHS), not legally enforceable. The responsibilities of patients are also undefined. I suggest {{that these are not}} to deny, of their own volition, the rights of others, which <b>in</b> <b>consultations</b> necessitate mutuality of involvement through information-exchange and shared decision-making. Preferences should be met insofar as they do not militate against responsibilities and rights...|$|R

His first {{assignment}} was to fix their problematic recording amplifiers whose overall phase shift measured {{out to a}} voice-distorting 1500 degrees. Hilliard's solution was to use higher linearity transformers obtained from Lansing Manufacturing Company, <b>in</b> <b>consultation</b> with founder Jim Lansing. Earlier, Hilliard had befriended a laboratory associate of his wife's, Dr. John Blackburn, and in 1934, he helped Blackburn get a position as design engineer at Lansing Manufacturing. The following year, Hilliard and his team at MGM solved the problem of recording Nelson Eddy's strong operatic baritone alongside Jeanette MacDonald's flat and weak soprano voice, picking up an Academy Award for Sound Recording on the duo's first film together: Naughty Marietta.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} {{relation}} between general practitioners' knowledge about their patients {{and the use of}} resources <b>in</b> <b>consultations.</b> DESIGN [...] A cross sectional evaluation of consultations. SETTING AND SUBJECTS [...] A representative sample of 133 Norwegian general practitioners were each asked to record 30 consecutive consultations. 131 did so, and of 3990 possible registrations, 3918 (98 %) were evaluated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] The influence, as assessed by the doctor, of accumulated knowledge on the use of laboratory tests, expectant management, prescriptions, sickness certification, referrals, and time spent <b>in</b> the <b>consultation.</b> RESULTS [...] Accumulated knowledge was a substantial factor in saving time, especially <b>in</b> <b>consultations</b> with children, the elderly, patients with psychosocial problems, and those with chronic diseases. It also influenced the overall use of laboratory tests, expectant management, sickness certification, and referrals, and to a lesser degree the use of medication.

5|$|Initially, {{the rulers}} of Europe {{considered}} the 1789 revolution in France as an affair between the French king and his subjects, and not a matter in which they should interfere. However, as the rhetoric grew more strident after 1790, the European monarchs began to view the French upheavals with alarm. Among the concerned monarchs were the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, who feared for the life and well-being of his sister, the Queen of France, Marie Antoinette. In August 1791, <b>in</b> <b>consultation</b> with French émigré nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, in which they declared {{the interest of the}} monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis XVI and his family.

5|$|Despite {{the failure}} of Adlertag and {{considerable}} loss rates on 15, 16 and 17 August, Kesselring convinced Göring that the only sound strategy was to continue to send heavily escorted bombers to destroy British airfields. Kesselring also advocated the use of Jagdgeschwader (fighter wings) in free-chase tactics. Messerschmitt Bf 109 single-engine fighters were to be sent out {{in advance of the}} main raids to force the British fighters into large-scale air battles which, in theory, would destroy RAF aircraft in combat and deplete the British defences. However, this time, Kesselring changed his operational methods. <b>In</b> <b>consultation</b> with Hugo Sperrle, commanding Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet 3), he chose not to scatter his effort against a large number of targets. Instead, he narrowed down the targets to a short list in order to concentrate his strength and striking power. Sector stations RAF Kenley, North Weald, Hornchurch and Biggin Hill were chosen as the prime targets.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of maintenance, the {{protective}} lacquer covering Knife Edge Two Piece degraded and exposed the surface of the sculpture to the elements. This resulted in oxidation of the bronze metal. Subsequent deterioration of the patination and years of graffiti scratched into the surface resulted in further corrosion. The conservation aimed to remove the remaining protective lacquer and surface dirt, and to remove the result of corrosion and oxidation from the sculpture, and take the surface back to the bare metal. Following the removal of graffiti the sculpture was repatinated to return it to its original colour. It was finally waxed with a weatherproof surface to protect it from future damage. The conservation work was undertaken by Rupert Harris Conservation, working <b>in</b> <b>consultation</b> with the Henry Moore Foundation. The cost of the conservation was £16,190, with £11,000 contributed by the Henry Moore Foundation.|$|E

50|$|An {{additional}} {{concern with}} consultations {{is that women}} and underrepresented populations are often left outside during the process. Large-scale projects in Mozambique rarely included women <b>in</b> <b>consultations</b> and never presented official reports and documents for authorization by women. This holds true when women are the primary workers on the land {{that is to be}} leased out to companies. Meanwhile, pastoralists and internally displaced people were oftentimes intentionally excluded from negotiations, as investors tried to delegitimize their claims on land. This led to a lack of awareness on the part of these vulnerable groups until lease agreements have already been signed to transfer land. This oversight <b>in</b> <b>consultations</b> further disenfranchises previously overlooked communities and worsens power inequities in local villages.|$|R

40|$|Taking {{a history}} is a key {{diagnostic}} instrument <b>in</b> paediatric <b>consultations.</b> Numerous issues potentially reduce the history's reliability.

We performed a systematic review on {{the literature on the}} reliability of history taking. No studies examined the reliability of history taking from parents, but there is a considerable body of evidence on the issue of mutual trust in relationships between health care professionals and patients. Because trust is a dynamic relational phenomenon, taking a patient centred approach <b>in</b> <b>consultations</b> is likely to increase the patients' and parents' trust in the health care professional, and their willingness to follow the health care professional's treatment proposals. We provide evidence based recommendations on how to build and maintain trust <b>in</b> paediatric <b>consultations</b> by taking a patient centred approach <b>in</b> such <b>consultations...</b>|$|R
