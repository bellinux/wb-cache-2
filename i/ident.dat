5|$|During this period, WIN {{expanded}} to include new stations in Victoria, Queensland, and New South Wales. In 1984, WIN became the first regional television station to transmit in stereophonic sound. Close links between WIN Television and the Nine Network, ensured it the Nine Network affiliation for southern New South Wales when aggregation took place in 1989 thus the logo of the station changed to that of its partner network with the matching nine dots and similar <b>ident</b> packages. The changes meant that WIN expanded {{into the rest of}} southern New South Wales, launching new stations in Canberra, Orange, Bathurst, Dubbo and Wagga Wagga, amongst others in 1989, {{and at the same time}} acquiring new facilities in Orange, Wagga and Canberra. It also provided the network with two additional competitors, The Prime Network and Capital Television.|$|E
25|$|August 2009 – August 2011: Between August 2009 and February 2010 TV3 {{introduced}} 8 new idents. The {{first two}} idents – known as 'Orchard' and 'Elevator' – launched TV3's live action idents. In September, a third <b>ident</b> entitled 'Wave' was added, followed in October by a fourth <b>ident</b> known as 'Bridge'. A edited {{version of the}} Bridge <b>ident</b> (to promote the series V), a sixth new <b>ident</b> known as 'Dog' was introduced in November 2009 and in December 2009 the <b>ident</b> 'snowman' was added and in February 2010 the 8th <b>ident</b> was added, 'bubbles'. TV3 {{has been working with}} Image Now to create these idents.|$|E
25|$|This <b>ident</b> was altered {{slightly}} on 1 September 1989 following the TVS management restructuring, {{so that the}} <b>ident</b> was against a gradient blue background and cut in to {{the rotation of the}} logo into the lettering. The caption was changed to 'Television' to reflect the stations technical name of TVS Television, and the music was altered slightly to be bolder. Against the blue background, the metallic lettering now has the appearance of glass or perspex. This <b>ident</b> was used by TVS until they went off air on 31 December 1992, when a special <b>ident</b> with the caption 'Thanks for Watching' was used to close the final TVS programme.|$|E
50|$|Special <b>idents</b> {{have also}} been used to mark occasions. The <b>idents</b> used for Easter {{celebrations}} during 2013 are documented {{in the list of}} Spring <b>idents.</b>|$|R
25|$|In September 2000, {{a new set}} of <b>idents</b> were {{gradually}} {{introduced to}} RTÉ One, with all the old <b>idents</b> from 1998 phased out by December of that year. The new <b>idents</b> featured Irish places and people, and all were set to a common set of background music. One of the original three <b>idents</b> were featured in seven of the new <b>idents,</b> subtly playing in the background.|$|R
5000|$|... 3e's Christmas <b>idents</b> {{were made}} {{in-house}} at TV3. Three <b>idents</b> were introduced 'Mistletoe', 'Snowballs' and 'Lights' The new <b>idents</b> were first show on Saturday 19 December.|$|R
25|$|In 1979, {{the station}} adopted the first computer-generated channel {{identification}} (<b>ident)</b> in Britain, with {{its use of}} the double striped, orange '2' logo. The <b>ident,</b> created in house by BBC engineers, lasted until March 1986 and heralded the start of computer-generated logos.|$|E
25|$|On 16 April 1979, BBC2 {{adopted the}} world's first computer-generated <b>ident,</b> with the logo being drawn live {{every time it}} was played. This version of the 2 had orange double lines either side and the 2 itself was cream double lined. This stripy 2 had been used on {{promotions}} and holding slides for years prior to its launch, {{and now it was}} part of a bigger branding package. For the first few years of the <b>ident,</b> it would be accompanied by a fanfare as it scrolled onto the screen. There were versions of the <b>ident</b> where the <b>ident</b> scrolled on, scrolled off and remained static. The clock used alongside this high tec 3D <b>ident,</b> was anything but. The old clock filmed from the NODD room survived, with a new 2D logo and sporting black and orange colours. However, in 1980, BBC2 got its own electronic clock including 3D legend and centre dot.|$|E
25|$|Comedian Peter Kay {{also made}} spoof {{editions of the}} Hip-Hop <b>ident</b> in 2003 {{in the guise of}} his Phoenix Nights {{character}} Brian Potter. The second version was shown minus the BBC One logo in 2005. This <b>ident</b> was used to introduce the Comic Relief of 2003.|$|E
50|$|Later on, the <b>idents</b> {{changed to}} follow a strand layout, with {{different}} <b>idents</b> for each strand. These featured an object, before a fact about it related to the strand appears and ends on an image with the strand name shown clearly on screen, with a letter encircled at {{the centre of the}} screen. It is unclear whether these <b>idents</b> were replacements of the animated <b>idents,</b> or complimentory to them, however it appears they complemented them, with these <b>idents</b> being used in the stranded sections, with the animated <b>idents</b> used for general interest programming.|$|R
50|$|Tigerlily also {{produces}} branded content, <b>idents</b> and commercials. Previous work includes Honda <b>idents</b> for Channel 4, Sci-Fi Channel <b>idents,</b> branded content films for Sony Creatology and for Rexona/Lotus F1.|$|R
5000|$|As of November 2014, {{there have}} been no {{sightings}} of the 'Windows on the World' <b>idents,</b> insinuating that the [...] "Windows" [...] <b>idents</b> themselves may have been retired, although other pieces of presentation and continuity (e.g. trail end boards) remain. Currently, the <b>idents</b> being shown are twelve <b>idents</b> from the '1991-2001' series.|$|R
25|$|TVS's {{identity}} {{featured a}} six coloured symbol that formed up {{in three stages}} from the outside in before zooming out and sitting alongside the TVS lettering, accompanied by a shortened version of the station theme New Forest Rondo. There were different variations for weekday and weekend, which only differed in the zoom out to the lettering. The <b>ident</b> was shot initially on film of a mechanical model, but was later shot using video effects and from 1985, a computer generated version of the <b>ident</b> was used. Accompanying this <b>ident</b> was a clock on a black background with the six TVS colours either side, and an <b>ident</b> sequence following the theme 'For the best view of the South' which was used prior to the news.|$|E
25|$|This <b>ident</b> {{remained}} with the station {{until the end}} of its existence with some modifications, firstly the jingle was altered to nine notes on a guitar a few years later, and then the background was revealed to be blue in 1969 with the introduction of colour (blue was the background colour of the <b>ident</b> as used in black and white, being shot with black background and white star would have given too much contrast and overexposed the camera). This <b>ident</b> with blue background colour was maintained after the introduction of colour transmissions because this still provided a good contrast on black and white TV sets. This <b>ident,</b> occasionally supplemented by a subsequent caption stating 'The Station that serves the South', lasted until the company went off air in 1982.|$|E
25|$|For the {{introduction}} of the first British colour broadcasting service in 1967 there was no new <b>ident,</b> but a new logo: a 2 with a dot inside the figure. There was originally a test period where the original presentation was used with possible electronic colour added. However, it was rejected and a new <b>ident</b> used. This <b>ident</b> was formed from the 3 light spots that come together to make the central dot. From there, a 2 is drawn around the dot. Once complete, the colour legend appears below before the 2 starts rotating slowly. The blue 2 rotates to reveal a red 2, green 2 and a white 2. The <b>ident</b> would continually spin after this. In 1969, when BBC1 launched its own colour service, the <b>ident</b> was updated to match BBC1's presentation. The 2 was now all white on a blue background, with the BBC2 logo underneath the 2. The clock that went alongside this look was originally a traditional clock face with Roman numerals before it was changed to a light blue clockface on a dark blue background with BBC2 legend below. This clock also had the 'polo' mint centre and was filmed on BBC2's NODD, black and white camera filming the clock with colour added later on.|$|E
5000|$|In 2017, the BBC One Circle <b>idents</b> were {{replaced}} by <b>idents</b> under the theme of [...] "Oneness", including a dance class {{and a group of}} swimmers. These <b>idents</b> have been criticised for lacking in creativity.|$|R
50|$|On 6 January 2003, the <b>idents</b> were {{replaced}} by the celebrity <b>idents,</b> mostly used by the Granada and Carlton regions, and adapted for use by Grampian. The ITV1 logo was replaced with Grampian's logo, and additional <b>idents</b> made depicting Scottish and Grampian celebrities. However, this was not to last, as in 2006, the Grampian name was to be lost on screen in favour of STV. The <b>idents</b> featured Scottish people passing around the logo, an elongated 'S', to other people in other scenes off screen until the 'S' {{is placed in the}} centre of the screen. The upbeat music and dynamic filming gives the <b>idents</b> an energetic quality to the station. These <b>idents</b> were shared with Scottish, as were all <b>idents</b> following the package as the two networks have ceased as separate entities.|$|R
50|$|The BBC Two Personality <b>idents</b> were {{a set of}} <b>idents</b> used on BBC Two from 19 November 2001 until 18 February 2007. The <b>idents</b> were {{produced}} by the Lambie-Nairn branding agency, who had created the previous look. The <b>idents</b> feature an ivory sans serif white '2' in a yellow environment and performing a variety of tasks, and a purple boxed BBC Two logo.|$|R
25|$|From 28 October 2002, all network {{programmes}} {{were introduced}} with a generic ITV1 <b>ident.</b> Regional programming used a generic <b>ident</b> {{with the name}} Tyne Tees below the ITV1 logo until November 2006, after which no regional idents existed. The Tyne Tees logo was last seen on production end boards until 2004, when they were replaced with, first an ITV logo, and then with an ITV Studios caption.|$|E
25|$|Upon launch, Central's {{on screen}} {{presentation}} featured a sphere (which resembled a moon or a total eclipse) which would burst open with light, before reforming, {{accompanied by a}} light jingle, but was dropped and revised during 1983, so the moon <b>ident</b> would just appear of darkness with the colour spectrum appearing to its left hand side. This <b>ident</b> was dropped locally in 1985, but remained {{on the front and}} end of networked programmes until 1988.|$|E
25|$|As well as programmes, BBC Two {{has also}} proved memorable for its {{numerous}} idents—various short sequences shown between programme junctions {{that serve as}} the channel identity. Nearly all of the identity packages used since the channel's launch in 1964 have featured a prominent numeral 2 in the design. Notable designs include the electronic double-striped 2, the white TWO <b>ident</b> (the only <b>ident</b> not to use a numeral 2), and most notably the 1991 2s.|$|E
5000|$|Retina Scan <b>Identd</b> (for Windows; {{supports}} multiple {{users in}} a way similar to Unix <b>identd)</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|A second refresh {{took place}} to {{coincide}} with the launch of BBC Two HD, replacing the BBC HD channel. All <b>idents</b> were updated with new soundtracks, with some even having two or three different versions. Three of the <b>idents</b> (Mirror, Seascape and Tent) feature songs from alt-J. Many also lost the sound effects which went along with them. This move sparked criticism online, with many saying that the old soundtracks were the best things about the <b>idents.</b> The original 2009 <b>idents</b> were still broadcast in the This is BBC Two loop until the [...] "Window on the World" [...] <b>idents</b> were phased out during late 2014 following the return of the 1990s <b>idents</b> in July 2014.|$|R
2500|$|During late 2013 {{and early}} 2014, BBC Two England and BBC Two Northern Ireland resurrected a {{selection}} of these <b>idents</b> (together {{with some of the}} former <b>idents)</b> as part of their 'Afternoon Classics' segment. BBC Two Wales also broadcast [...] "Powder" [...] during the 50th Anniversary of BBC Wales. As of August 2014, some of the set have come back semi-permanently for the 50th Birthday of the channel in all regions. On 1 January 2015, BBC Two was rebranded with the 1990s <b>idents</b> returning as the only <b>idents</b> in use after a short break during the Christmas season. The 2015 rebrand consists of the 1991–2001 <b>idents,</b> but they now have the BBC Two 50 Years box replaced with BBC Two's regular teal-coloured box logo. However, BBC Two Northern Ireland airs the <b>idents</b> with the BBC Two Northern Ireland logo in the centre of the <b>idents</b> with the box removed.|$|R
25|$|On 28 September, the BBC {{unveiled}} a Twitter hashtag (#SaveTheDay) and an <b>ident</b> {{that was used}} to promote the special. Respectively, the hashtag and the <b>ident</b> were shown before and after the premiere of Atlantis on BBC One. The hashtag was used to reveal all subsequent promotional material. On 7 November 2013, a video starring Smith in character as the Doctor was released promoting the hashtag, promising exclusive content. A website was launched to reveal the content.|$|E
25|$|As {{national}} broadcasters join {{and leave}} the Eurovision feed transmitted by the EBU, the EBU/Eurovision network logo <b>ident</b> (not {{to be confused with}} the song contest logo) is displayed. The accompanying theme music (used on other Eurovision broadcasts) is the prelude to Marc-Antoine Charpentier's Te Deum. Originally, the same logo was used for both the Eurovision network and the European Broadcasting Union, however, they now have two different logos; when the <b>ident</b> is transmitted, it is the Eurovision network logo that appears.|$|E
25|$|The Launch <b>ident</b> was a {{television}} station identification used by BBC Two between their launch night in 1964 {{and the introduction}} of colour in 1967.|$|E
5000|$|On 23 January 2006 {{a new set}} of <b>idents</b> was launched, {{based on}} four letter words such as Hope, Fast and Love. The <b>idents</b> at first did not feature the logo, but the <b>idents</b> were revised on 2 January 2007 to include the word Five again.|$|R
50|$|Many livestream {{channels}} use identification {{although there}} is no rule to have identification on livestream channels. Many channels use corner bugs with the channel logo. Channels sometimes can be very creative creating many animated <b>idents.</b> Others have <b>idents</b> which are short adverts mentioning the channel name. Some of the channels that have <b>idents</b> include Tv47, GU3, EnglishTV, GTVTWO and TheKorienMovieChannel. Many livestream channels even use graphic design companies to create <b>idents</b> for their channel.|$|R
25|$|The <b>idents</b> {{were very}} quickly parodied by digital channel E4 in 2002 with spoofs of the Capoeira, Ballet and Acrobat <b>idents.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the IRC protocol, a user's {{nickname}} and <b>ident</b> {{are separated}} by an exclamation mark in the hostmask assigned {{to him or her}} by the server.|$|E
25|$|In April 2012, Nine Network's {{identity}} changed, {{applying the}} logo in different colours such as red, green, purple, and more. It is also {{reminiscent of the}} 2002 <b>ident</b> package.|$|E
25|$|A further spoof {{featured}} Jon Culshaw as Tony Blair {{dancing in}} a fictional <b>ident</b> outside 10 Downing Street. This was shown on a July 2003 episode of Dead Ringers, broadcast on BBC Two.|$|E
50|$|BBC2 used {{a number}} of special <b>idents</b> through its years, mainly for use at Christmas. Special <b>idents</b> were {{commissioned}} for this.|$|R
50|$|On 29 December 2014, ITV {{introduces}} 4 new <b>idents</b> from January 2015 and later, {{more new}} <b>idents</b> from February 2015 onwards.|$|R
