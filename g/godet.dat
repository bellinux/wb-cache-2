2500|$|Both {{the female}} lead (Héloïse <b>Godet</b> and Zoé Bruneau) {{and the male}} lead (Kamel Abdeli and Richard Chevallier) were {{intentionally}} cast to physically resemble each other. The scenes with Bruneau and Chevallier were shot in the summer, while the scenes with <b>Godet</b> and Abdeli were shot in the winter. The actors waited {{two and a half}} years to begin shooting after first being cast due to constant delays. After rehearsing for two years, Abdelli travelled from Paris to Rolle for the first day of shooting, only to discover that Godard had changed his mind. Bruneau's 2014 memoir Waiting for Godard chronicles the making of the film. Godard often re-wrote scenes the night before filming and allowed no improvisation on set, aside from minor screen blocking. One such improvisation involved an actress sitting in front of a lamp, resulting in lens flare that Aragno called [...] "magic" [...] in 3D. <b>Godet</b> said that Godard's direction was [...] "very precise and very gentle, but clear and no discussion about it." [...] There was very little rehearsal time for the actors, but Aragno took a lot of time to set up each shot. French film historian Florence Colombani was asked to travel to Godard's home and act in the film, then discovered that he only wanted to film her hands drawing the Cross of Lorraine while she spoke her dialogue.|$|E
2500|$|Goodbye to Language (...) is a 2014 French-Swiss 3D {{experimental}} narrative essay film {{written and}} directed by Jean-Luc Godard. It stars Héloïse <b>Godet,</b> Kamel Abdeli, Richard Chevallier, Zoé Bruneau, Jessica Erickson and Christian Grégori and was shot by cinematographer Fabrice Aragno. It is Godard's 42nd feature film and 121st film or video project. In the French-speaking parts of Switzerland where it was shot, the word [...] "adieu" [...] can mean both goodbye and hello. The film depicts a couple having an affair. The woman's husband discovers the affair and the lover is killed. Two pairs of actors portray the couple and their actions repeat and mirror one another. Godard's own dog Roxy Miéville has a prominent role in the film and won a prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Like many of Godard's films it includes numerous quotes and references to previous artistic, philosophical and scientific works, most prominently those of Jacques Ellul, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Mary Shelley.|$|E

30|$|In summary, as {{illustrated}} in Tables  1 and 2, the density of localized states near the Fermi level have been deduced to increase {{with the increase of}} grain size in the CdSe nanoparticle films, which justifies <b>Godet's</b> model. The gradual decrease in the activation energy (existence of different slopes in the plots of conductivity) with temperature suggests that the conduction is due to the hopping of the carriers among the localized states. We suggest that the samples made by this method have a convenient characteristic for the investigation of nanosensing properties, because the density of state and electrical conduction change by external subject.|$|R

40|$|The {{future is}} to be built – is {{multiple}} and uncertain. Within the social sciences, scenarios {{can be defined as}} a description of a future situation and a course of events that allow move from a primary position toward this future situation. Currently, there is a multiplicity of methods and tools available for building scenarios, including methods of an essentially rationalist approach, as Michel <b>Godet’s</b> method. The purpose of this work is to use the hypothetical-deductive method to reduce, starting from Michel <b>Godet’s</b> Scenario Method and its tools, the complexity of the scenario-building process while maintaining the robustness of the findings. For this purpose, it is proposed two different approaches: (1) to integrate, in one step, the structural analysis and the cross-impact matrix so the first one derives automatically while filling the last one; (2) to use the concept of Bayesian networks as a method to integrate the cross-impact matrix and the morphological analysis. Both approaches aim {{to reduce the amount of}} information needed to feed the tools and improve the feedback criteria, resulting in greater flexibility during the process and better holistic view of the system. Scientifically, these approaches open a new field of studies in scenario planning as it appropriates the concept of Bayesian networks, widely used in other areas of knowledge (artificial intelligence, geological studies, medical diagnostics, pattern classification, etc.), and bring it to the field of social sciences...|$|R
50|$|Antony is traversed {{by three}} rivers: the Bièvre River and its two tributaries - the Ruisseau des <b>Godets</b> and the Ruisseau of Aulnay. One {{branch of the}} Bièvre {{upstream}} flows in the open through Heller Park {{in an area where}} the Bièvre is maintained by the Inter-communal association for development of the Bièvre Valley. From there it has been channeled and covered since the decision of the municipal council on 26 October 1950 nearly all the way to Paris. It then becomes part of the network of the Inter-departmental association for sanitation of the Paris agglomeration. Since the early 2000s, the restoration of the open air to the Bièvre at Antony and downstream has been envisaged. In 2003 this was done to Fresnes at the Pars des Prés {{on the edge of the}} La Fontaine district of Antony.|$|R
40|$|The {{friction}} and wear {{behavior of a}} lubricated AlSi 11 Cu 3 disk in contact with a 100 Cr 6 pin was studied by a radionuclide-assisted pin-on-disk tribometer. It {{is well known that}} shear forces change chemistry and microstructure of the near-surface material, thereby influencing {{friction and}} wear. To better understand the influences of the microstructure on the running-in behavior, disks with different silicon phase morphologies were tested under constant stressing conditions. Topography, chemistry and microstructure of pin and disk were characterized before and after tribological testing by white light interferometry, X-ray photoelectron. spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy and focused ion beam microscopy. Wear of pins was measured with a radionuclide technique to resolve ultra-low wear rates. To characterize near-surface deformations, Ga ion markers were implanted and Auger electron spectroscopy was applied to follow their shear-induced displacements. To monitor subsurface shear, the deformation of columnar markers was analyzed. The results were discussed using <b>Godet's</b> third body model. Furthermore, the results allowed to us extend the model to systems operated under ultra-low wear rates...|$|R

30|$|In this work, {{the effects}} of {{deposition}} time and annealing on the density of states of CdSe nanoparticle films, prepared by chemical bath deposition, were investigated. It was observed that in the higher pH, the grain size increased. In the nanocrystalline films, the charge carriers confined inside the nanoparticles, due to the reduction of grains size hence the electronic states close to the Fermi level, are localized. The gradual decrease in the activation energy with temperature suggests that the conduction {{is due to the}} hopping of the carriers among the localized states. The density of localized states near the Fermi level has been deduced to increase with increase of grain size in the CdSe nanoparticle films, in agreement with <b>Godet's</b> model. Our calculated localization parameters agreed with very small values of LP, where it corresponds to high temperature or low conduction. The localization parameters are due to confinement effect and confined charge carrier. For our system, modeling of ohmic conductivity for hopping within exponential distributions is useful in comparison with Mott's assumption of constant density of state near Fermi level. We suggest that the samples made by this method have a convenient characteristic for the investigation of nanosensing properties, because density of state and electrical conduction change by external subject.|$|R
40|$|Our {{research}} {{is centered on}} creating synthetic fibers with our spider silk proteins (MaSp 1 /MaSp 2) incorporated into them. This is done through two processes; Electrospinning and Wet Spinning. A liquid dope is created using our two proteins and different solvents. The first process for creating synthetic fibers is using our electrospinning instrument, in which our dope is placed into a syringe and a positive electrode is attached to it while the target (rotating spindle or stationary target) has the negative electrode attached. The flow rate, spindle rotation, and current (approximately 28 kV) can {{vary depending on the}} desired situation. Once all three parameters have been chosen, the voltage ejects the dope at an incredibly quick rate inducing nanofiber formation on the spindle, which can then be collected and rolled into tough fibers. The second method is that of wet spinning, in which the dope is ejected into a solution of either water, IPA, or methanol. As the fiber forms within the liquid it is then taken and placed onto <b>Godets,</b> a system which allows for different rates of stretch within different solvent baths. Both techniques are used to combine our 2 proteins with different fibers such as nylon, with the potential to increase the fibers mechanical properties...|$|R
