40|$|Addition curing polyimides, {{prepared}} from noncoplanar 2, 2 '-bis(trifluoromethyl) 4, 4 ' <b>diaminobiphenyl</b> (BTDB) {{with various}} dianhydrides were evaluated as high temperature polymer matrix materials. T sub g of these polymers were measured by mechanical methods {{as well as}} by thermal mechanical analysis. Physical and mechanical properties as well as the thermo-oxidative stability of neat resins and the corresponding G 40 - 600 graphite fiber reinforced composites were compared to that of PMR-II- 50 and V-CAP- 75...|$|E
40|$|Terminal piperidinyl- and nitro-functionalized biphenyls, bridged {{between the}} 2 and 2 prime {{positions}} by a variable number of methylene groups, are synthesized and fully characterized. These push-pull systems with defined and restricted torsion angles between their phenyl rings are ideal model compounds {{to investigate the}} influence of the chromophore's conjugation in nonlinear optic (NLO) responses. A general synthetic route that can be implemented to access these model compounds is reported, starting from dibromo or ditriflate biphenyls. Hartwig-Buchwald cross-coupling, a selective azacycloalkylation of <b>diaminobiphenyls</b> and a mild oxidation of primary amines to nitro groups {{in the presence of a}} tertiary amine summarizes the synthetic pathway towards the desired model compounds. NLO properties of the series of torsionally constrained push-pull biphenyls are collected by electric-field-induced second-harmonic generation (EFISH) experiments. The results agree qualitatively with semi-empirical simulations based on the AM 1 Hamiltonian. A linear dependence of the quadratic response on the cos 2 (Phi) of the inter-aryl dihedral angle is observed, which points to oscillator strength loss as the dominant effect of increasing backbone twist...|$|R
