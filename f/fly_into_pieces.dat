[...] "I did {{not think}} that any men on foot could have {{resisted}} that charge, but the Franks stood as steadily {{as if it were a}} flock of sheep that was approaching them. The cannon are terrible. Who would have thought that the balls they shoot would explode and <b>fly</b> <b>into</b> <b>pieces</b> when they reach their mark! How is it done?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In an October 2011 New York Times Critics' Pick review, Manohla Dargis {{called the}} film [...] "an existential mystery, a melodramatic thriller, a medical horror film {{or just a}} polymorphous extravaganza"; {{according}} to Dargis: It takes {{time to get a}} handle on the story (and even then, your grip may not be secure), though it's instantly clear that something is jumping beneath the surface here, threatening to burst forth. Vera's plight and the temporal shifts help create an air of unease and barely controlled chaos, an unsettling vibe that becomes spooky when Ledgard puts on a white lab coat and begins doing strange things with blood....There are times in The Skin I Live In when it feels as if the whole thing will <b>fly</b> <b>into</b> <b>pieces,</b> as complication is piled onto complication, and new characters and intrigues are introduced amid horror, melodrama and slapstick.... Yet Mr. Almodóvar's control remains virtuosic and the film hangs together completely, secured by Vera and Ledgard and a relationship that's a Pandora's box from which identity, gender, sex and desire spring.|$|E
60|$|What was that? There was {{a shrill}} cry {{from one of}} the monks, and Paul, finding their grasp relaxed, started up. They were cowering down like a flock of frightened animals. The room seemed full of red fire. The glass in the windows cracked; it <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> <b>pieces,</b> and a column of smoke curled in. The door was thrown open; Guiseppe stood for a moment on the threshold.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not always. We {{used to have}} {{a pretty}} little house over this, but the cruel shells came {{crashing}} in, and <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> <b>pieces,</b> tearing everything to splinters, and we are only safe from them down here. Ah, if I could only have shown you Mamma's pretty room! But there is a great hole in the floor now, and the ceiling is all tumbling down, and the table broken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This, Friend-from-the-Sea. The Bellower there, {{when the}} {{sacrifice}} {{was about to}} be offered to Oro at the dawn, rushed forward, and having thrust something between the legs of the image of the god, poured yellow water over it, and with fire caused it to burst into fierce flame. Then he ran away and mocked the god who presently, with a loud report, <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> <b>pieces</b> and killed that man. Therefore the Bellower must be sacrificed." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then we ran hard, as evidently {{there was}} no time to lose. While we went I {{extracted}} from the terrified girl, whom we forced to show us the way, that as the sacrifice was about to be offered Bastin had appeared, and, [...] "making fire," [...] applied it to the god Oro, who instantly burst into flame. Then he ran back, calling out that the devil was dead. As he did so there was a loud explosion and Oro <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> <b>pieces.</b> His burning head went a long way into the air and, falling on to one of the priests, killed him. Thereon the other priests and the people seized the Bellower and made him fast. Now they were engaged in heating an oven in which to put him to cook. When it was ready they would eat him in honour of Oro.|$|R
60|$|While the quarrel {{was going}} on, Niels had loaded the gun again, {{and just as}} the second giant was about to put a nice tit-bit into his mouth, bang! went the gun again, and the fork <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> a dozen <b>pieces.</b>|$|R
60|$|And, indeed, what he {{had seen}} was enough to fill any man with amazement. Out of the small square window which faced him a man had {{suddenly}} shot head-foremost, pitching on to his outstretched hands and then bounding to his feet. Within a foot of his heels came the head of a second one, who fell more heavily than the first, and yet recovered himself as quickly. The one wore the blue coat with silver facings of the king's guard; the second had the dark coat and clean-shaven face of a man of peace; but each carried a short rusty iron bar in his hand. Not a word did either of them say, but the soldier took two quick steps forward and struck at the headsman while he was still poising himself for a blow at the victim. There was a thud, with a crackle like a breaking egg, and the bar <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> <b>pieces.</b> The heads-man gave a dreadful cry, and dropped his axe, clapped his two hands to his head, and running zigzag across the scaffold, fell over, a dead man, into the courtyard beneath.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is key {{enough for}} me!" [...] quoth Hordle John, {{picking up the}} huge stone, and hurling it against the door with all the {{strength}} of his enormous body. The lock shivered, the wood smashed, the stone <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> five <b>pieces,</b> but the iron clamps still held the door in its position. Bending down, he thrust his great fingers under it, and with a heave raised the whole mass of wood and iron from its hinges. For a moment it tottered and swayed, and then, falling outward, buried him in its ruin, while his comrades rushed into the dark archway which led to safety.|$|R
6000|$|Only {{then did}} I {{understand}} {{how difficult is}} this fox chase, for one may cut again and again at the creature and never strike him once. He is small, and turns quickly from a blow. At every cut I heard those shouts of encouragement from behind me, and they spurred me to yet another effort. And then at last the supreme moment of my triumph arrived. In {{the very act of}} turning I caught him fair with such another back-handed cut as that with which I killed the aide-de-camp of the Emperor of Russia. He <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> two <b>pieces,</b> his head one way and his tail another. I looked back and waved the blood-stained sabre in the air. For the moment I was exalted--superb! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How fortunate," [...] {{said the}} Girl, {{as she went}} to her room, [...] "that I {{relieved}} my mind to that Young Man out in the park today. If I had come back with all that pent-up feeling seething within me and heard this news right on top of it all, I might have <b>flown</b> <b>into</b> a thousand <b>pieces.</b> What lovely brown eyes he had! I do dote on brown eyes. The Creature will be sure to have fishy blue ones." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then he {{must have}} a hint of it,' said Wegg, 'and a strong one that'll jog his terrors a bit. Give him an inch, and he'll take an ell. Let him alone this time, and what'll he do with our {{property}} next? I tell you what, Mr Venus; it comes to this; I must be overbearing with Boffin, or I shall <b>fly</b> <b>into</b> several <b>pieces.</b> I can't contain myself when I look at him. Every time I see him putting his hand in his pocket, I see him putting it into my pocket. Every time I hear him jingling his money, I hear him taking liberties with my money. Flesh and blood can't bear it. No,' said Mr Wegg, greatly exasperated, 'and I'll go further. A wooden leg can't bear it!' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{took the}} knife and tried to strike the youth, and he even tried to cut himself with it, but found it impossible. Then he asked the maiden to show him how to split stones and rocks {{with the help of}} the ring. So she led him into a {{courtyard}} where stood a great boulder-stone. 'Now,' she said, 'put the ring upon the thumb of your left hand, and you will see how strong that hand has become. The youth did so, and found to his astonishment that with a single blow of his fist the stone <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> a thousand <b>pieces.</b> Then the youth bethought him that he who does not use his luck when he has it is a fool, and that this was a chance which once lost might never return. So while they stood laughing at the shattered stone he placed the ring, as if in play, upon the third finger of his left hand.|$|R
50|$|Eventually the US Navy {{lost all}} three American-built rigid {{airships}} to accidents. USS Shenandoah <b>flew</b> <b>into</b> a severe thunderstorm over Noble County, Ohio {{while on a}} poorly planned publicity flight on 3 September 1925. It broke <b>into</b> <b>pieces,</b> killing 14 of its crew. USS Akron {{was caught in a}} severe storm and <b>flown</b> <b>into</b> the surface of the sea off the shore of New Jersey on 3 April 1933. It carried no life boats and few life vests, so 73 of its crew of 76 died from drowning or hypothermia.USS Macon was lost after suffering a structural failure offshore near Point Sur Lighthouse on 12 February 1935. The failure caused a loss of gas, which was made much worse when the aircraft was driven over pressure height causing it to lose too much helium to maintain flight. Only 2 of its crew of 83 died in the crash thanks to the inclusion of life jackets and inflatable rafts after the Akron disaster.|$|R
