40|$|<b>Epsilon-Caprolactam,</b> {{the main}} {{product of the}} Beckmann {{rearrangement}} of cyclohexanone oxime, is an intermediate {{in the manufacture of}} nylon- 6. Currently, most of the industrial plants produce <b>epsilon-caprolactam</b> by the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime using sulphuric acid or oleum as a homogeneous catalyst. This process has two main disadvantages: (i) The production of uneconomical by-product, such as ammonium sulphate, and (ii) the environmentally unfriendly corrosive reaction medium. In recent years, the demand for environmentally benign processes has been increasing due to the stringent environmental regulations. Therefore, the new route of the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime on solid acid catalysts has gained increasing interest as an environmentally, economically and energetically favorable process. For the first time in 2003, the catalytic vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime on high-silica MFI-type zeolites has been industrialized by Sumitomo Chemical Company Ltd. in Japan. Despite the commercialization of this process, several issues are not clear and remain under debate. The main issues are: (i) The nature and location of active sites of the catalysts, (ii) the chemistry of the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement reaction (i. e. adsorption and desorption behavior of reactants, intermediates, products, and by-products of the reaction), (iii) the reasons for the catalyst deactivation, and (iv) the influence of additives during the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement. The present work mainly focussed on the above-mentioned issues. In this study, for better understanding of the reaction, mechanistic aspects of the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement on solid catalysts have been studied by in situ solid-state NMR spectroscopy. To study the reaction, several solid catalysts, such as MFI-type zeolites (silicalite- 1, H-[B]ZSM- 5 and H-ZSM- 5) and mesoporous materials (SBA- 15, [Al]SBA- 15, H-[Si]MCM- 41, and H-[Al]MCM- 41) were prepared according to the procedures described in the literature. The catalysts were characterized by various techniques, such as powder X-ray diffraction, ICP-OES, N 2 adsorption measurements (BET surface), SEM, and solid-state 1 H, 2 H, and 29 Si MAS NMR spectroscopy. It has been reported that boron-containing ZSM- 5 zeolite (H-[B]ZSM- 5) is highly selective in the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime. However, the nature of the active sites in this zeolite and the influence of reactant molecules on framework boron atoms were not reported in the literature. In this study, the nature of active sites and the coordination change of framework boron atoms upon adsorption of reactant molecules in H-[B]ZSM- 5 (nSi / nB = 38) zeolite were studied by simultaneous 1 H and 11 B MAS NMR spectroscopy. For this purpose, several probe molecules characterized by different proton affinities (PA) were adsorbed on the zeolite. Probe molecules, such as pyridine, ammonia, and acetone, were loaded on H [B]ZSM- 5 zeolites by an in situ flow technique. The 1 H MAS NMR spectrum of dehydrated zeolite H [B]ZSM- 5 consists of signals at 1. 9, 2. 5, and 3. 2 ppm. Upon adsorption of pyridine (PA = 930 kJ mol- 1) and ammonia (PA = 854 kJ mol- 1) on H-[B]ZSM- 5 zeolite, the signal at 2. 5 ppm was mainly affected. Therefore, the signal at 2. 5 ppm was assigned to the Brønsted acidic SiOH[B] groups in the vicinity of framework boron species. On the other hand, by 11 B MAS NMR spectroscopy, the coordination change of B[3] species into B[4] species was investigated. It was found that the proton affinity of PA &# 8805; 854 kJ mol- 1 is required for probe molecules to induce the coordination change of the framework B[3] species into B[4] species in H-[B]ZSM- 5 zeolite. This coordination change of framework boron was accompanied by the protonation of probe molecules with PA &# 8805; 854 kJ mol- 1. As a result of protonation, a decrease of the 11 B quadrupole coupling constant from CQCC = 2. 7 ± 0. 1 MHz (B[3]) to CQCC &# 8804; 0. 85 MHz (B[4]) was noticed. This PA value (&# 8805; 854 kJ mol 1) is slightly higher (ca. 30 kJ mol- 1) than the proton affinity of PA = 821 kJ mol- 1 required for the protonation of probe molecules adsorbed on aluminum-containing zeolites reported in the literature. This is supported by the lower acid strength of SiOH[B] groups in H-[B]ZSM- 5 zeolites than the bridging OH groups (SiOH[Al]) in aluminum-containing zeolites. In the present study, for the first time, high-speed 2 H MAS NMR spectroscopy at the sample spinning rates of 25 kHz was applied to study the surface sites of deuterated catalysts and their interaction with non-deuterated reactant molecules. Deuterated catalysts, such as H/D-ZSM- 5, H/D-[Al]SBA- 15, and H/D-SBA- 15, were successfully prepared by the H/D exchange of OH groups using D 2 O vapor. By 2 H MAS NMR spectroscopy, suitable spectral resolution of the signals of SiOH groups (ca. 1. 8 ppm) and bridging hydroxyl groups (ca. 5. 7 ppm) in the 2 H MAS NMR spectrum of H/D-ZSM- 5 was achieved. Two reactant molecules characterized by different molecular diameters, such as cyclohexanone oxime (ca. 0. 65 nm) and cyclododecanone oxime (ca. 0. 9 nm), were adsorbed on H/D exchanged catalysts at room temperature. Upon adsorption of non-deuterated reactant molecules (i. e. cyclohexanone and cyclododecanone oximes), a dominating signal at ca. 12 ppm was observed in the 2 H MAS NMR spectra of H/D exchanged catalysts (H/D-ZSM- 5, H/D-[Al]SBA- 15, and H/D-SBA- 15). These results indicate that all kinds of surface sites of H/D-ZSM- 5 zeolite, such as silanol groups, silanol nests, or Brønsted acid sites, which can be located on the external surface, near the pore mouth, or in the interior pores, are accessible for cyclohexanone oxime. In situ solid-state 1 H and 15 N MAS NMR spectroscopy were utilized to study the chemistry of the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime on MFI-type zeolites and mesoporous MCM- 41 and SBA- 15 -type materials. The results obtained in this work help to understand the adsorption, desorption, and reaction behavior of reactants, intermediates, products, and by-products formed during the reaction. Initially, in situ 1 H MAS NMR spectroscopy was applied to study the step-wise conversion of cyclohexanone oxime-D 11 on silicalite- 1 (nSi / nAl = 1700) and H-ZSM- 5 (nSi / nAl = 14) catalysts. Deuterated cyclohexanone oxime (i. e. cyclohexanone oxime-D 11) was successfully prepared with the H/D exchange degree of ca. 83 %. The vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime-D 11 was performed on non-deuterated silicalite- 1 and H-ZSM- 5 catalysts at different reaction temperatures. The 1 H MAS NMR spectroscopy provided the evidence on the formation of reaction intermediates, such as H-bonded cyclohexanone oxime and N-protonated cyclohexanone oxime on SiOH groups and bridging hydroxyl groups, respectively. From the 1 H MAS NMR studies of the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime-D 11 on weakly acidic silicalite- 1, the formation of <b>epsilon-caprolactam,</b> hydroxylamine, and 5 -cyano- 1 -penetene was observed as product and by-product molecules of the reaction. In contrast, on strongly acidic H-ZSM- 5 catalyst, the O-protonated <b>epsilon-caprolactam</b> was identified due to the strong adsorption of this species on bridging hydroxyl groups. Furthermore, the conversion of O-protonated <b>epsilon-caprolactam</b> on bridging hydroxyl groups of H-ZSM- 5 {{led to the formation of}} N-protonated <b>epsilon-caprolactam,</b> or non- or N-protonated epsilon-aminocapric acid species. The observable chemical shift range of 15 N MAS NMR spectroscopy is larger than the observable chemical shifts range of 1 H MAS NMR spectroscopy. Therefore, in situ solid-state 15 N NMR spectroscopy is the most suitable technique to study the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, the interpretation of 15 N MAS NMR signals is less complicated than of 1 H MAS NMR signals. In this work, the chemistry of the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement on solid catalysts was thoroughly studied by in situ 15 N MAS NMR spectroscopy. The 15 N MAS NMR results suggest that both SiOH and Brønsted acid sites are active in this reaction. 15 N-cyclohexanone oxime interacts with SiOH groups via hydrogen bonding, which is indicated by the 15 N MAS NMR signal in the range of - 30 to - 46 ppm, while it interacts strongly with Brønsted acid sites and form N-protonated cyclohexanone oxime as represented by the 15 N MAS NMR signal in the range of - 145 to - 160 ppm. By-products, such as hydroxylamine and amines, were also observed on siliceous catalysts. The corresponding 15 N MAS NMR signals of these species are in the range of - 269 to - 280, and - 375 to - 387 ppm, respectively. In addition, O-protonation of the main product <b>epsilon-caprolactam</b> was found on both siliceous and Brønsted acidic catalysts as evidenced by the 15 N MAS NMR signal at - 237 ppm. On siliceous catalysts, however, the O protonation of <b>epsilon-caprolactam</b> depends on the number of acidic Q 3 (Si(OSi) 3 OH) silanol groups, which is ascertained by 29 Si MAS NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the conversion of O-protonated <b>epsilon-caprolactam</b> into N-protonated <b>epsilon-caprolactam,</b> and non- or N protoanted epsilon-aminocapric acid was exclusively observed on Brønsted acidic catalysts. Generally, methanol as an additive in the reaction system improves the selectivity towards the desired product <b>epsilon-caprolactam</b> during the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime. In this study, the influence of the methanol on the adsorbed species formed and the conversion of the additive methanol during the vapor-phase Beckmann rearrangement reaction were investigated by in situ 15 N and 13 C MAS NMR spectroscopy. On silicalite- 1 and H-ZSM- 5 zeolites, hydrocarbons (13 C MAS NMR signals in the range of 25 to 30 ppm) were formed and deposited at increasing reaction temperatures. Furthermore, the formation of isopropyl amine (13 C MAS NMR signal at 42 ppm) was observed on silicalite- 1 as a result of the reaction of isobutane (13 C MAS NMR signal at 25 ppm) and hydroxyl amine, which is a by-product of the Beckmann rearrangement. On strongly acidic H-ZSM- 5 zeolite, methanol (13 C MAS NMR signal at ca. 50 ppm) dehydrates into dimethylether (DME) and water. This water promotes the conversion of O-protonated <b>epsilon-caprolactam</b> into non- or N-protonated epsilon-aminocapric acid. On the mesoporous SBA- 15 materials, no influence and conversion of methanol was detected by 15 N and 13 C MAS NMR spectroscopy. <b>epsilon-Caprolactam,</b> das Hauptprodukt der Beckmann-Umlagerung von Cyclohexanonoxim, ist ein Zwischenprodukt in der Herstellung von Nylon- 6. Zurzeit wird <b>epsilon-Caprolactam</b> industriell durch die Beckmann-Umlagerung von Cyclohexanonoxim unter Verwendung von Schwefelsäure oder Oleum als homogener Katalysator hergestellt. Dieser Prozess hat zwei grundsätzliche Nachteile: (i) Die Produktion des unwirtschaftlichen Nebenprodukts Ammoniumsulfat und (ii) das umweltgefährdende, korrosive Reaktionsmedium. In den letzten Jahren ist die Nachfrage nach umweltfreundlichen Herstellungsverfahren aufgrund strengerer Umweltgesetze gestiegen. Daher hat die Beckmann-Umlagerung von Cyclohexanonoxim in der Gasphase an Festkörperkatalysatoren ein stark zunehmendes Interesse erfahren, da dies ein umweltfreundlicher, ökonomischer und energetisch bevorzugter Prozess ist. Im Jahr 2003 wurde zum ersten Mal die katalytische Beckmann-Umlagerung von Cyclohexanonoxim in der Gasphase an High-silica-Zeolithen des MFI-Typs industriell von Sumitomo Chemical Company Ltd. in Japan realisiert. Trotz der Kommerzialisierung dieses Prozesses sind wichtige Aspekte unklar und werden kontrovers diskutiert. Die hauptsächlichen Fragen sind: (i) Die Natur und Lokalisierung der aktiven Zentren des Katalysators, (ii) die Chemie der Beckmann-Umlagerung von Cyclohexanonoxim in der Gasphase (Adsorptions- und Desorptionsverhalten der Reaktanten, Intermediate, Produkte und Nebenprodukte der Reaktion), (iii) die Ursache der Deaktivierung des Katalysators und (iv) der Einfluss von Additiven während der Beckmann-Umlagerung in der Gasphase. Die vorliegende Arbeit fokussiert hauptsächlich auf die oben erwähnten Fragestellungen. Zum besseren Verständnis der Reaktion wurden mechanistische Aspekte der Beckmann-Umlagerung in der Gasphase an Festkörperkatalysatoren mittels In-situ-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie untersucht. Hierzu wurden verschiedene Festkörperkatalysatoren, wie Zeolithe des MFI-Typs (Silicalit- 1, H-[B]ZSM- 5 und H-ZSM- 5) und mesoporöse Materialien (SBA- 15, [Al]SBA- 15, H-[Si]MCM- 41, und H-[Al]MCM- 41) nach in der Literatur beschriebenen Vorschriften präpariert. Die Katalysatoren wurden mittels Pulverdiffraktometrie, ICP-OES, N 2 -Adsorptionsmessungen (BET Oberfläche), REM und Festkörper 1 H-, 2 H- und 29 Si-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie charakterisiert. Es wurde berichtet, dass borhaltige ZSM- 5 -Zeolithe (H-[B]ZSM- 5) hoch selektiv in der Beckmann-Umlagerung von Cyclohexanonoxim in der Gasphase sind. Jedoch wurde in der Literatur nichts über die Natur der aktiven Zentren in diesem Zeolith und dem Einfluss der Reaktanden auf die Bor-Atome im Gerüst berichtet. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden die Natur der aktiven Zentren und der Koordinationswechsel von Bor-Atomen im Gerüst, hervorgerufen durch die Adsorption des Reaktanden an dem H-[B]ZSM- 5 -Zeolith (nSi / nB = 38) durch simultane 1 H- und 11 B-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie untersucht. Für diesen Zweck wurden einige Sondenmoleküle, gekennzeichnet durch verschiedene Protonenaffinitäten (PA), am Zeolith adsorbiert. Die Sondenmoleküle Pyridin, Ammoniak und Aceton wurden mit Hilfe einer In-situ-Flow-Technik auf dem H-[B]ZSM- 5 -Zeolith adsorbiert. Das 1 H-MAS-NMR-Spektrum des dehydratisierten H-[B]ZSM- 5 -Zeoliths enthält Signale bei 1, 9, 2, 5 und 3, 2 ppm. Durch Adsorption von Pyridin (PA = 930 kJ mol- 1) und Ammoniak (PA = 854 kJ mol- 1) am H-[B]ZSM- 5 -Zeolith wurde vorwiegend das Signal bei 2, 5 ppm beeinflusst. Daher wurde dieses Signal den Brønsted-sauren SiOH[B]-Gruppen in Nachbarschaft von Bor-Atomen im Gerüst zugeordnet. Des Weiteren wurde durch 11 B-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie der Koordinationswechsel von B[3]-Spezies in B[4]-Spezies im Gerüst des H-[B]ZSM- 5 -Zeoliths untersucht. Es wurde gefunden, dass eine Protonenaffinität von PA &# 8805; 854 kJ mol- 1 für die Sondenmoleküle nötig ist, um den Koordinationswechsel der B[3]-Spezies in B[4]-Spezies zu bewirken. Dieser Koordinationswechsel der Bor-Atome im Gerüst war begleitet von einer Protonierung der Sondenmoleküle mit PA &# 8805; 854 kJ mol- 1. Als ein Resultat der Protonierung wurde eine Reduzierung der 11 B-Quadrupol-kopplungskonstante von CQCC = 2, 7 &# 177; 0, 1 MHz (B[3]) auf CQCC &# 8804; 0, 85 MHz (B[4]) festgestellt. Die Protonenaffinität von PA &# 8805; 854 kJ mol- 1 ist geringfügig höher (ca. 30 kJ mol- 1) als der PA-Wert von 821 kJ mol- 1, der aus der Literatur für die Protonierung von Sondenmoleküle aluminiumhaltiger Zeolithe bekannt ist. Dies wird durch die geringere Säurestärke der SiOH[B]-Gruppen des H-[B]ZSM- 5 -Zeoliths im Vergleich mit den Brücken-OH-Gruppen (SiOH[Al]) in aluminiumhaltigen Zeolithen unterstützt. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde erstmalig die High-speed- 2 H-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie bei einer Rotordrehzahl von 25 kHz verwendet. Dies diente dazu, die Oberflächenzentren von deuterierten Katalysatoren und ihre Wechselwirkung mit nicht deuterierten Reaktanden zu untersuchen. Deuterierte Katalysatoren, wie H/D-ZSM- 5, H/D-[Al]SBA- 15 und H/D-SBA- 15, wurden erfolgreich durch einen H/D-Austausch der OH-Gruppen mit D 2 O-Dampf hergestellt. Mittels 2 H-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie konnte eine geeignete spektrale Auflösung der Signale der SiOH-Gruppen (ca. 1, 8 ppm) und Brücken-OH-Gruppen (ca. 5, 7 ppm) im 2 H-MAS-NMR-Spektrum des H/D-ZSM- 5 - Zeoliths erreicht werden. Zwei Reaktandenmoleküle, gekennzeichnet durch verschiedene molekulare Durchmesser (Cyclohexanonoxim: ca. 0, 65 nm, Cyclododecanonoxim: ca. 0, 9 nm), wurden an H/D-ausgetauschten Katalysatoren bei Raumtemperatur adsorbiert. Nach Adsorption der nicht deuterierten Reaktanden wurde in den 2 H-MAS-NMR-Spektren der H/D-ausgetauschten Katalysatoren (H/D-ZSM- 5, H/D-[Al]SBA- 15 und H/D-SBA- 15) intensive Signale bei ca. 12 ppm beobachtet. Diese Ergebnisse zeigen, dass alle Arten der Oberflächenzentren des H/D-ZSM- 5 -Zeoliths (Silanolgruppen, Silanolnester und Brønsted-Säurezentren), die auf der äußeren Oberfläche, neben den Porenöffnungen oder im Inneren der Poren lokalisiert sind, für Cyclohexanonoxim zugänglich sind. Die In-situ- 1 H- und 15 N-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie wurde zur Untersuchung der Chemie der Beckmann-Umlagerung von Cyclohexanonoxim in der Gasphase an Zeolithen des MFI-Typs und mesoporösen Materialien, wie MCM- 41 und SBA- 15, verwendet. Die Ergebnisse der vorliegenden Arbeit helfen, die Adsorption, die Desorption und das Reaktionsverhalten der Reaktanden, Intermediate, Produkte und Nebenprodukte, die während der Reaktion gebildet werden, zu verstehen. Zunächst wurde die In-situ- 1 H-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie dazu verwendet, den schrittweisen Umsatz von Cyclohexanonoxim-D 11 an Silicalit- 1 - (nSi / nAl = 1700) und H-ZSM- 5 -Katalysatoren (nSi / nAl = 14) zu untersuchen. Cyclohexanonoxim-D 11 wurde erfolgreich mit einem H/D-Austauschgrad von ca. 83 % hergestellt. Die Beckmann-Umlagerung von Cyclohexanonoxim-D 11 in der Gasphase wurde an nicht deuterierten Silicalit- 1 - und H-ZSM- 5 -Katalysatoren bei verschiedenen Reaktionstemperaturen durchgeführt. Die 1 H-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie lieferte den Beweis, dass sich während der Reaktion Intermediate, wie H-gebundenes Cyclohexanonoxim und N-protoniertes Cyclohexanonoxim an SiOH- und Brücken-OH-Gruppen bilden. Durch die 1 H-MAS-NMR-Untersuchung der Beckmann-Umlagerung von Cyclohexanonoxim-D 11 an schwach saurem Silicalit- 1 in der Gasphase konnte die Bildung von <b>epsilon-Caprolactam,</b> Hydroxylamin und 5 -Cyano- 1 -penten als Produkte und Nebenprodukte der Reaktion beobachtet werden. Im Gegensatz hierzu wurde an stark sauren H-ZSM- 5 -Katalysatoren das O-protonierte <b>epsilon-Caprolactam</b> aufgrund der starken Adsorption dieser Spezies an den Brücken-OH-Gruppen identifiziert. Des Weiteren führte die Umsetzung des O-protonierten epsilon-Caprolactams an den Brücken-OH-Gruppen des H-ZSM- 5 -Zeoliths zur Bildung von N-protoniertem <b>epsilon-Caprolactam</b> und nicht- oder N-protonierten Spezies der epsilon-Aminocapronsäure. Der beobachtbare Bereich der chemischen Verschiebung der 15 N-MAS-NMR-Signale ist größer als der Verschiebungsbereich der 1 H-MAS-NMR-Signale gleicher Spezies. Daher ist die In-situ- 15 N-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie eine interessante Technik zur Untersuchung des Reaktionsmechanismus. Weiterhin ist die Interpretation der 15 N-MAS-NMR-Signale weniger kompliziert als die der 1 H-MAS-NMR-Signale. Daher wurde in der vorliegenden Arbeit die Chemie der Beckmann-Umlagerung in der Gasphase an Festkörperkatalysatoren auch mit Hilfe der 15 N-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie untersucht. Die Ergebnisse dieser 15 N-MAS-NMR-Untersuchungen deuten darauf hin, dass sowohl die SiOH- als auch die Brønsted-Säurezentren an dieser Reaktion beteiligt sind. 15 N-Cyclohexanonoxim wechselwirkt mit SiOH-Gruppen durch Wasserstoffbrückenbindungen. Dies wird durch 15 N-MAS-NMR-Signale im Bereich von - 30 bis - 46 ppm belegt. Hingegen ist die Wechselwirkung von N-protoniertem Cyclohexanonoxim mit den Brønsted-Säurezentren viel stärker. In diesem Fall treten 15 N-MAS-NMR-Signale im Bereich von - 145 bis - 160 ppm auf. Nebenprodukte, wie Hydroxylamine und Amine, wurden auch an silicatischen Katalysatoren beobachtet. Die hiermit verbundenen 15 N-MAS-NMR-Signale dieser Spezies wurden im Bereich von - 269 bis - 280 und - 375 bis - 387 ppm beobachtet. Zusätzlich wurde die O-Protonierung des Hauptprodukts <b>epsilon-Caprolactam</b> an silicatischen und Brønsted-sauren Katalysatoren gefunden, wie das 15 N-MAS-NMR-Signal bei - 237 ppm belegt. Jedoch hängt bei silicatischen Katalysatoren die O-Protonierung des epsilon-Caprolactams von der Anzahl saurer Q 3 -Silanolgruppen (Si(OSi) 3 OH), wie durch 29 Si-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie gezeigt, ab. Die Umsetzung von O-protoniertem <b>epsilon-Caprolactam</b> in N-protoniertes <b>epsilon-Caprolactam</b> und in nicht- oder N-protonierte epsilon-Aminocapronsäure wurde ausschließlich an Brønsted-sauren Katalysatoren beobachtet. Methanol ist ein Additiv im Reaktionssystem, das während der Beckmann-Umlagerung von Cyclohexanonoxim in der Gasphase die Selektivität in Richtung des gewünschten Produkts <b>epsilon-Caprolactam</b> verschiebt. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde der Einfluss von Methanol auf die gebildeten Spezies und die Umsetzung des Additivs Methanol während der Beckmann-Umlagerung in der Gasphase mit Hilfe der In-situ- 15 N- und 13 C-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie untersucht. An Silicalit- 1 und H-ZSM- 5 -Zeolithen wurden Kohlenwasserstoffe mit steigenden Reaktionstemperaturen gebildet und abgeschieden (13 C-MAS-NMR-Signale bei 25 bis 30 ppm). Außerdem wurde die Bildung von Isopropylamin (13 C-MAS-NMR-Signal bei 42 ppm) an Silicalit- 1 als Ergebnis der Reaktion von Isobutan (13 C-MAS-NMR-Signal bei 25 ppm) mit Hydroxylamin, das ein Nebenprodukt der Beckmann-Umlagerung ist, beobachtet. An stark saurem H-ZSM- 5 -Zeolith dehydratisiert Methanol (13 C-MAS-NMR-Signal bei ca. 50 ppm) zu Dimethylether und Wasser. Dieses Reaktionswasser bewirkt die Umwandlung von O-protoniertem <b>epsilon-Caprolactam</b> in nicht- oder N-protonierte epsilon-Aminocapronsäure. An mesoporösen Materialien, wie SBA- 15, wurde mittles 15 N- und 13 C-MAS-NMR-Spektroskopie weder ein Einfluss noch eine Umwandlung des Additivs Methanol festgestellt...|$|E

The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of solvent, transportation and storage time on the migration of ε-caprolactam from a Nylon- 6 -based lidding material into water or a white wine substitute (12 % ethanol). Polypropylene plastic cups were filled, sealed, packaged, stacked and exposed to a simulated 3 -day cross-country shipment. Cups were sampled with or without simulated shipment after 0, 7, 14 and 28 days at 20. 6 °C. <b>Epsilon-caprolactam</b> was determined using a GC equipped with FID and a Restek Rtx 1301 megabore column. Results of the study indicated migration of ε-caprolactam into containers at the time of sealing with significantly higher levels (4. 42 ppm average) occurring in cups containing 12 % ethanol vs. water (0. 01 ppm average). After the cups were sealed, neither simulated cross-country shipment nor storage increased levels of ε-caprolactam in either solvent. The results indicate that wine sealed in packages lined with Nylon- 6 -based plastic could contain significant amounts of ε-caprolactam. However, it is not understood how the alcohol, whether as liquid or vapor, interacted with the lidding material to increase migration at the time of sealing. No delamination of the polypropylene layer in the lidding material was observed after sealing.

This polymorphic behavior is dependent on the cooling rate of nylon 6 /clay nanocomposites from melt and the content of saponite or montmorillonite in nylon 6 /clay nanocomposites.

Todays state of the art is the use of two different kinds of blocking mechanisms for PU powder coatings. In case of externally blocked isocyanate cross-linkers the blocking agent, e. g. <b>epsilon-caprolactam,</b> is set free at temperatures above 170 deg C. The liberation of the blocking agent improves the flow properties of the coating but the mam disadvantage is its emission during the curing process.

Nylon 6 /clay has prepared by the intercalation of <b>epsilon-caprolactam</b> and then exfoliating the layered silicates by subsequent polymerization. The DSC isothermal results reveal that introducing saponite into the nylon structure causes strongly heterogeneous nucleation induced change of the crystal growth process from a two-dimensional crystal growth to a three dimensional spherulitic growth. But the crystal growth mechanism of nylon/montmorillonite nanocomposites is a mixed two-dimensional and three-dimensional spherulitic growth. The activation energy drastically decreases with the presence of 2. 5 wt% clay in nylon/clay nanocomposites and then slightly increases with increasing clay content. The result indicates that the addition of clay into nylon induces the heterogeneous nucleation (a lower DeltaE) at lower clay content and then reduces the transportation ability of polymer chains during crystallization processes at higher clay content (a higher DeltaE).

40|$|The {{origin of}} the beta {{transition}} in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is still a pending question. This transition has been studied by dynamic mechanical analysis (d. m. a.) and differential scanning calorimetry (d. s. c.) in dependence on sample annealing and dilution with <b>epsilon-caprolactam</b> (CPL). The beta transition temperature is increased upon annealing and thus influenced by the polymer crystallization. Upon addition of CPL, there is no systematic shift in the beta transition temperature, {{in contrast to the}} PVDF crystallinity that increases steadily. A shoulder on the low temperature side of the beta transition peak is also observed as a result of annealing. It is shifted to lower temperatures when CPL is added, consistently with a glass transition. It thus appears that the so-called beta-transition is sensitive to the amorphous material, but in a close relationship with the polymer crystallization. Comparison of the observations by d. s. c, and d. m. a. shows that the broad transition observed for the unannealed samples would result from the overlap of two transitions: the glass transition of the unconstrained amorphous phase and the glass transition of chains constrained by the crystalline phase.

The biobased routes for each target molecule are analysed separately, comparing the conventional processes with their sustainable alternatives.

40|$|The {{material}} {{class of}} biopolymers attracts increasing attention {{and is considered}} as a promising development in the plastics industry. In particular, the degradable polymers {{play an important role}} due to their environmentally friendly properties and the wide range of applications for which they can be deployed for. These range from biodegradable packaging to biomedical devices. Polyesteramides belong to the class of biopolymers and combine the different properties of amides and esters. The ester and amide amount in the polyesteramides as well as their properties can be influenced and controlled chemically during their synthesis. Especially for biomedical applications polyesteramides are considered to be an important material. As they are surface eroding polymers, they are not causing a local in vivo acidity during their degradation and hence are, compared to other polymers which are used for such devices, avoiding inflammatory responses of the body. In this work the synthesis of a polyesteramides with good thermal, mechanical and processing properties, by using reactive extrusion, is being developed. The focus thereby lies on the synthesis of thermoplastic polyesteramides. These are mainly produced by batch synthesis and could not achieve an importance on the market up to now. In literature examples for the preparation of polyesteramides on a twin-screw extruder using the monomers <b>epsilon-caprolactam</b> and epsilon-caprolactone were reported, but this process has not achieved any industrial relevance so far. In this work a new synthesis approach for the continuous synthesis of polyesteramides is presented, which is based on the anionic ring opening polymerization of <b>epsilon-caprolactam</b> in the melt of commercially available polyester-polycaprolactone. The amide fragments are incorporated into the polyester via a chain transfer reaction during polymerization, which leads to polyesteramides with blocky nature. As the melt viscosity before and after the polymerization reaction, is comparable, the process design can easily be simplified, which allows an easier scale-up. The first part of this work is focused on the chemical development of the reaction and its evaluation. Furthermore, the requirements for the synthesis on a twin-screw extruder as well as the required properties of the extrudate and the polymer for such a processing are defined. To assess and optimize the synthesis the reaction was performed on a twin-screw microcompounder in batches. The influence of the chemicals and how to conduct the process, especially regarding temperature and reaction progress are studied. The characterization of the resulting polymers allowed their subsequent evaluation, and thus the assessment and evaluation of the chemical reaction and the process. At reaction temperatures of 180 °C and residence times of ten minutes polyesteramides with blocky structure were synthesized at high conversion rates. For one of the studied mixtures the synthesis was carried out continuously on a laboratory extruder with a screw diameter of 16 mm and a L/D= 25. The focus lay {{on the development of the}} process control as well as the screw design. Calculations to determine the residence time of the polymer using a simulation program were performed in order to avoid time-consuming experiments with „trial-and-error“ principle. After optimization and configuration of the screw it was possible to transfer the synthesis of the mixture synthesized in the microcompounder to a laboratory extruder process resulting in comparable analytical results. The work contributes to the continuous synthesis of polyesteramides by reactive extrusion. Furthermore it points out that the material class of biopolymers and in particular of polyesteramides still offers a great research potential...|$|E

Annular photoreactors with low and middle-pressure mercury arc lamps and a solar non concentrating tubular receiver reactor have been applied to examine the treatment of exhaust air washer liquor and its components in the laboratory and up to semi-technical scale. The application of sole UV radiation, the combination of UV radiation with oxidants, semiconductor photocatalysts and the light enhanced Fenton reaction were compared. The photo Fenton conditions were optimized in respect of throughput and hydrogen peroxide consumption. The degradation pathway of <b>epsilon-caprolactam</b> (the main constituent of the air washer liquor) was analyzed by ion chromatography and HPLC-MS. The overall degradation was controlled by total organic carbon analysis.

In comparison to photolytic hydrogen peroxide oxidation, light enhanced Fenton turned out to be much faster and to consume lower amounts of hydrogen peroxide.

The {{comparison of the}} diffraction intensity, calculated on modeled structures, with the experimental profiles, collected by us through an automatic diffractometer, is presented. This analysis has put into evidence the following limiting structural features. (a) The beta form of nylon 6 is made of small mesomorphic aggregates of chains (where the matter scatters coherently) with axes arranged in a hexagonal lattice (a = b = 0. 48 nm; gamma = 120 degrees). (b) The chains have disordered conformations (and {{do not have a}} definite chirality, as it is the case for the 2 (1) helices in the alpha and gamma forms) with the -CH 2 - chains close to nearly all-trans (antiperiplanar) and the two dihedral angles adjacent to the amide bond, +/- 120 degrees) to antiperiplanar (180 degrees). This notwithstanding, the chains are straight and extended. As a result, the mean chain periodicity is close to 0. 835 nm. (c) The H-bonds are formed along lines in the [100], [010], and [1 (1) over bar 0 $] directions; they force neighboring chains within the small mesomorphic aggregates to adjust their conformation {{in such a way that}} nearly 100 % of hydrogen bonds are always formed, in agreement with the IR data. In the case of the alpha and gamma more ordered forms of nylon 6, such lines are all in a unique direction, leading to hydrogen-bonded sheets (parallel to the chain axis) of enantiomorphous anticlined, alternately up and down chains (in the alpha form) or of isomorphous isoclined chains, (in the gamma form), (d) As a consequence, since the amide groups lie all at nearly the same height along z, in the beta form of nylon 6 the lines of hydrogen bonds lie in layers perpendicular to the chain asis and have the same direction within each layer. However, consecutive layers along z may have the lines of H-bonds which are not parallel (e. g., occasionally rotated by + 120 or - 120 degrees instead of the ''normal'' 180 degrees).

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the synthesis, {{characterization}} and applications of aliphatic segmented poly(ester amide) s (PEA) s for use as potential biomaterials. Three different series of PEAs with different microstructures containing isolated, two and three adjacent amide groups within a polybutylene adipate (PBA) chain have been synthesized. Analytical techniques such as NMR (liquid and solid-state), SEC, DSC, FT-IR, WAXD and microscopy (AFM, SEM, optical) have been extensively used to characterize the synthesized monomers and PEAs. Thermal properties have been determined and correlated to features like morphology and crystallization behaviour; structure-property relationship of these polymers were established. The preparation of tailor made monomers for the synthesis of PEAs {{was carried out by}} ring opening of <b>epsilon-caprolactam,</b> epsilon-caprolactone or delta-valerolactone with 1, 4 -diaminobutane, 4 -aminobutanol, 3 -aminopropanol and/or 2 -aminoethanol. These preformed monomers which are alpha,omega-diamines, alpha,omega-amino alcohols or alpha,omega-diols, each containing an in-built amide bond, were obtained in high purity and yields. Synthesis of the PEAs containing an isolated amide group, two or three adjacent amide groups was achieved by a two-step melt polycondensation of the preformed monomers with 1, 4 -butanediol and dimethyl adipate. In the first step, trans-esterification was carried out so as to avoid a random microstructure and hence, PEAs with segmented microstructure could be obtained. In the second step, polycondensation took place. Further, the amide content in each series could be varied by taking different ratios of the preformed monomer to 1, 4 -butanediol. High molecular weight PEAs were obtained in good yield and NMR analyses showed that no side reactions had taken place. Thermal analyses revealed that the length of the amide segment, functional groups participating in the crystallization process as well as the amide concentration influenced the transition temperatures and their enthalpies. For the three-adjacent amide series, mainly the amide groups crystallize and only a single endotherm and exotherm was seen. The melting and crystallization temperature increase with increasing amide content. Similar trend was also observed for the two-adjacent amide series of PEAs but here, both ester and amide groups co-crystallize and show multiple endotherms and exotherms. In the isolated amide series, mainly ester groups formed the hard domains and only at very high amide content, ester-amide co-crystallization was observed. FT-IR analyses revealed that the PEAs crystallize mainly in the alpha-form found in even-even nylons and the chains are bridged via hydrogen bonds. Morphology of the two-adjacent amide series of PEAs was investigated in detail using solid state NMR analyses. Spin diffusion experiments were performed to determine the domain sizes of the rigid, interface and mobile phases. A correlation of these domain sizes with the amide content in the PEA was successfully established. 13 C solid state NMR analyses gave information about the functional groups participating in the crystalline and amorphous phases which were in line with the observed thermal properties. The hydrolytic degradation of the synthesized PEAs was evaluated in PBS buffer at 37 °C over a time period of 24 weeks. The PEAs showed slow degradation kinetics and a maximum mass loss of 7 % over the entire time period which proceeded by cleavage of the ester bonds. Further, PEA foils sustain cell growth and are non-cytotoxic to mouse fibroblasts (L 929) cells. Electrospinning of the two-adjacent amide series of PEAs was carried out from solution in order to obtain non wovens for tissue engineering purposes. Among a series of solvents and solvent mixtures used, CHCl 3 /HCOOH mixtures gave the best results. Small amounts of formic acid were added to break the hydrogen bonds in the polymers. Effect of polymer concentration, microstructure and applied voltage on the resulting fibre diameter and morphology were also studied. Fibre quality and homogeneity enhanced with increasing amide content and polymer concentration and these factors played a decisive role in obtaining uniform, randomly oriented, homogeneous fibres in the nanometre range...|$|E
