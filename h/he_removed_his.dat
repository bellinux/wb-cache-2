Though Demeke kept the pistol pointed at Goebel's head {{for the duration of}} the flight, <b>he</b> <b>removed</b> <b>his</b> ski mask. Goebel later told newspapers that he spent the hours trying to build a rapport with Demeke, who admitted to having spent several months planning the hijacking. Both men agreed that, upon arriving in New York, Goebel would give Demeke his sunglasses in exchange for Demeke's pistol.|$|E
5|$|A New Zealander, Aaron Saxton's {{parents were}} Scientologists. Saxton's father {{committed}} suicide {{when he was}} 14, and this {{had a significant impact}} on him. At age 15 he joined the Scientology group called the Sea Org, an elite unit within the organisation. After joining Scientology staff, Saxton moved to work with the organisation in Sydney, Australia. Saxton's mother signed over guardianship of her son to Scientology when he was 16 years old. Saxton was assigned to become a security officer for the organisation. According to Saxton staff in Scientology were not given sufficient drugs or medical attention, and so <b>he</b> <b>removed</b> <b>his</b> own teeth without usage of medication for pain.|$|E

5|$|Genghis Khan (also {{known as}} Chinggis Khan) lost his {{battle against the}} Merkit (one of the major tribal confederations (khanlig) of the Mongols) and escaped death by seeking {{protection}} in the sacred precincts of the Burkhan Khaldun mountains. An old woman saved him and a few others. As mark of great reverence, which in Mongolia is considered a highly sacred mountain of spiritual significance, and to the sun above, he offered his respects to {{the spirits of the}} mountain around him, sprayed milk into the air and sprinkled it on the earth. <b>He</b> <b>removed</b> <b>his</b> girdle strap, unwinding it from his outfit, and then put it around his neck. Symbolically by this act he surrendered his Mongolian man's pride and expressed his submission to the gods.|$|E
25|$|In 1780, {{he painted}} the portraits of King George III and his queen and {{afterwards}} received many royal commissions.

25|$|Laurent {{took a few}} steps, not speaking. <b>He</b> <b>removed</b> <b>his</b> {{jacket and}} vest. In shirtsleeves, he glanced again at Thérèse, who had not stirred. He seemed to hesitate. Then he noticed the pink shoulder, and bent down to press his {{trembling}} lips against that bit of bare skin. The young woman pulled her shoulder away, turning around abruptly. She stared at Laurent with a gaze so strangely mingling repugnance and dread that he stepped back, troubled and uneasy, as if overcome with terror and disgust himself.|$|E
25|$|Sheriff Wann {{stood in}} front of the jail and {{addressed}} the mob, saying he would kill the first person to come through the door. <b>He</b> <b>removed</b> <b>his</b> belt and handed his gun to one of his deputies. He walked through the mob and the crowd parted to let him through; Wann was not touched by anyone. He walked across the street to the courthouse where he telephoned Governor Benjamin M. Miller, who mobilized the Alabama Army National Guard to protect the jail. He took the defendants to the county seat of Gadsden, Alabama, for indictment and to await trial. Although rape was potentially a capital offense in Alabama, the defendants at this point were not allowed to consult an attorney.|$|E
25|$|In 1833, Jackson {{attempted}} to begin removing federal deposits from the bank, whose money-lending functions were {{taken over by}} the legions of local and state banks that materialized across America, thus drastically increasing credit and speculation. Jackson's moves were greatly controversial. <b>He</b> <b>removed</b> <b>his</b> moderately pro-Bank Treasury Secretary Louis McLane, having him serve instead as Secretary of State, replacing Edward Livingston. He replaced McLane with William J. Duane. However, in September he fired Duane for refusing to remove the deposits. He replaced him with Attorney General Roger B. Taney, a strong opponent of the Bank. Under Taney, the deposits began to be removed. Biddle responded by stockpiling the Bank's reserves and contracting credit, thus causing interest rates to rise and bringing about a financial panic. Intended to force Jackson into a compromise, the move backfired, increasing anti-Bank sentiment.|$|E

500|$|Both Benetton drivers {{managed to}} finish both their {{cars in the}} points {{for the first time}} in the season. Fisichella said he was [...] "very happy, for Jenson and myself" [...] and thanked members of his team for his result. Button {{believed}} that his team's good result was because of improved changes to the balance on his Benetton. He later revealed that <b>he</b> <b>removed</b> <b>his</b> water bottle tube from his mouth which caused water to spray on his face under braking. The result lead to Benetton technical director Mike Gascoyne to describe the race as [...] "a useful kick-start before the final races of the season" [...] and said Benetton would ensure that the result was not [...] "a one-off". Alesi described the weekend as [...] "a very important one for the team" [...] because of his sixth-place finish.|$|E
500|$|Kemper again {{brought his}} victims {{back to his}} mother's house, this time {{beheading}} them {{in his car and}} carrying a headless corpse into his mother's house to have sex with. He then dismembered the bodies, removed the bullets to prevent identification and, the next morning, discarded their remains. Remains were found at Eden Canyon a week after the murders, and more were found near Highway 1 in March. When questioned in a later interview as to why <b>he</b> <b>removed</b> <b>his</b> victim's head before having sex with the body, he explained: [...] "The head trip fantasies were a bit like a trophy. You know, the head is where everything is at, the brain, eyes, mouth. That's the person. I remember being told as a kid, you cut off the head and the body dies. The body is nothing after the head is cut off... well, that's not quite true, there's a lot left in the girl's body without the head." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Buffer, {{the boxing}} ring {{announcer}} {{best known for}} his catchphrase, [...] "Let's get ready to rumble!", made a guest appearance as himself in [...] "Damien". Parker and Stone originally planned to use the catchphrase without Buffer, but when they learned that Buffer had legally trademarked the phrase, they included him in the episode since getting the rights for the catchphrase cost nearly as much as hiring Buffer for a guest appearance. Parker and Stone both said Buffer was friendly and they enjoyed working with him. Voice actor Mike Judge, star of Beavis and Butt-Head and King of the Hill, had originally been slated to provide the voice of the Damien character, and even recorded several lines for the part. However, since Judge lives in Austin, Texas, it proved too difficult to for him to come back and rerecord lines as the script and episode changed, so Stone instead provided the character's voice. Judge later provided Kenny's un-muffled line when <b>he</b> <b>removed</b> <b>his</b> parka in [...]|$|E

500|$|The {{opening ceremonies}} {{were held in}} Bislett Stadium on 15 February. [...] King George VI of Great Britain had died on 6 February 1952, eight days {{before the start of}} the Games. [...] As a result, all {{national}} flags were flown at half-mast, and Princess Ragnhild opened the Games in place of her grandfather, King Haakon VII, who was in London attending the funeral. [...] This was the first time an Olympic Games had been declared open by a woman. The parade of nations was held according to tradition, with Greece first, the rest of the nations proceeding by Norwegian alphabetical order, with the host nation last. [...] The British, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand teams all wore black arm bands at the opening ceremonies in memory of their monarch. [...] After the parade of nations the Olympic flame was lit. [...] On 13 February, at the start of the inaugural Winter Olympics torch relay, the torch was lit in the hearth of the Morgedal House, birthplace of skiing pioneer Sondre Norheim. [...] The torch relay lasted two days and took place entirely on skis. [...] At the opening ceremonies the final torch bearer, Eigil Nansen, received the Olympic torch and skied to a flight of stairs where <b>he</b> <b>removed</b> <b>his</b> skis, ascended, and ignited the flame.|$|E
500|$|Sources {{differ on}} {{when and where}} the film premiered. According to film critic Daniel Eagan, Florey premiered the film in a movie club in Los Angeles, while film writer Anthony Slide wrote that it opened at New York City's Cameo Theatre on June 17, 1928. However, David E. James said the film had its true premiere at Charlie Chaplin's villa in Beverly Hills, California. Chaplin, who by this time was disenchanted with many aspects of Hollywood filmmaking, was so {{impressed}} with the film that he watched it five times, and then screened it for guests at his home. This audience included elites from the film industry, including Douglas Fairbanks, John Considine, Harry d'Arrast, D. W. Griffith, Jesse L. Lasky, Ernst Lubitsch, Lewis Milestone, Mary Pickford, Joseph M. Schenck, Norma Talmadge, Josef von Sternberg, and King Vidor. The screening was accompanied by a record of Rhapsody in Blue, as well as Chaplin himself playing the organ. Florey was so fearful of a negative reaction due to the film's satire of Hollywood that <b>he</b> <b>removed</b> <b>his</b> name from the credits and hid in the projection room during the screening. While the audience originally expected it to be one of Chaplin's gags, they were very impressed with the film, and Schenck arranged for it to be shown on a United Artists Theater on Broadway starting on March 21, 1928. A special musical score, based on Rhapsody in Blue, was prepared by Hugo Riesenfeld for the showing, which was played by a live orchestra, and made heavy use of the saxophone. With a presentation usually reserved for bigger budget films, it played twice nightly along with the Gloria Swanson film Sadie Thompson, and was billed as [...] "the first of the impressionistic photoplays to be made in America".|$|E
