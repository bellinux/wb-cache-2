To this end, Australia, along with Europe and a few other countries, was one of the initial adopters of IFRS for domestic purposes (in the developed world). It must be acknowledged, however, that IFRS and primarily IAS have been part and parcel of accounting standard package in the developing world for many years since the relevant accounting bodies were more open to adoption of international standards for many reasons including that of capability.|$|R

40|$|Under certain {{circumstances}} cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) 1 are induced by processed antigen (1, 2). The mechanism of processing is still unknown, but macrophage-like accessory cells (AC) are involved (3 - 6). The processing presumably allows small particles of antigen {{to form an}} immunogenic association with gene products coded for by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).

This interaction would generate all the soluble factors (7 - 10) needed for turning precursor CTL (CTLp) into effective killer cells. Since in vitro CTL can be induced by soluble factors and unprocessed antigen alone, i. e., in accessory-cell-depleted cultures (11, 12), cell-to-cell contact is deemed to be unnecessary at this step (13 - 15).

40|$|The present paper gives a {{detailed}} analysis and <b>interpretation</b> of <b>16</b> poems in Jorie Graham's collection, Swarm (2000), which bear "UNDERNEATH" as their main titles.

The paper investigates the speaker's reactant behavior in "Underneath" poems, seeking a way to restore her lost freedom. Reactance behaviors can be skepticism, inertia, aggression, and resistance.

This study examines IFRIC 15 s practice from a longer perspective. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explain the effect that the <b>interpretation</b> <b>IFRIC</b> 15 has had on accounting objectives and qualitative characteristics of the revenue recognition of Swedish construction companies. The study will also analyze whether the construction companies has changed their perception of IFRIC 15 after applying it form a longer time perspective. Data were collected through interviews with the companies JM, NCC, PEAB and Skanska, as well as from the annual report of the companies.   The result shows that all construction companies in this study have been obliged to apply IAS 18. The change in accounting standards has led to a change in accounting method from the percentage of completion to completion method of revenue recognition of certain types of projects. The change of accounting method in the application of IFRIC 15 has an effect on the qualitative characteristics and accounting objectives, as the companies largely apply the realization concept and the prudence concept. The application of IFRIC 15 has also had different effects on the qualitative characteristics of the companies' revenue recognition. The consequence of this is that three of the studied companies believe that the financial statements don’t give a true and fair view of the financial performance and position of the company, which has led to an establishment of a segment reporting.

While introducing several novel theoretical perspectives, this work has yet to lead to practical algorithms. In an effort to bridge this gap, we describe in this paper two related results. Our first and main result is a simple algorithm to approximate the solution {{to a set of}} linear equations defined by a Laplacian (for a graph G with n nodes and m < n^ 2 edges) constraint matrix. The algorithm is a non-recursive algorithm; even though it runs in O(n^ 2 ·(n)) time rather than O(m · polylog(n)) time (given an oracle for the so-called statistical leverage scores), it is extremely simple; and {{it can be used to}} compute an approximate solution with a direct solver. In light of this result, our second result is a straightforward connection between the concept of graph resistance (which has proven useful in recent algorithms for linear equation solvers) and the concept of statistical leverage (which has proven useful in numerically-implementable randomized algorithms for large matrix problems and which has a natural data-analytic <b>interpretation).</b> Comment: <b>16</b> page...|$|R

40|$|This article evaluates Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) {{accounting}} {{practice and the}} related financial accounting and reporting requirements. Governments across the world are seeking to access private finance to improve public infrastructure. Accounting for PPPs has encountered many difficulties, {{one of which is}} the practice by which PPPs are not accounted for as fixed assets on the balance sheet of either the public sector client or the private sector operator. Accounting for PPPs has grown in importance at a time of transition from national Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP) to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Under UK GAAP, both client and operator accounting adopt the reasoning – familiar from leasing standards – of the allocation of risks and rewards between the parties to determine the party which should recognize the fixed asset on its balance sheet. The gap in IFRS with regard to operator accounting has been filled by the <b>interpretation</b> <b>IFRIC</b> 12 on service concession agreements: this moves the reasoning from risks and rewards to control, familiar from consolidation standards. The UK Treasury and the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB) have required/proposed the adoption of the mirror-image treatment of IFRIC 12. In most, but not all, cases, control will be assessed to rest with the client, which will recognize property, plant and equipment, and not with the operator, which will recognize either a financial asset or an intangible asset on the basis of an assessment of which party bears the majority of risks and rewards. Under both UK GAAP and IFRS, accounting policy choices are strongly influenced by, for the client, governmental control frameworks, and for the operator, by the implications for the profile of distributable profits and for taxation. An important public policy issue is that the national accounts, which for European Union member states must comply with European System of Accounts 1995, will remain on a risks and rewards basis. It is these numbers that will be used in assessments of macro-fiscal policy and fiscal risks, notwithstanding that the Eurostat version of risks and rewards is even more open to manipulation than were the national financial reporting standards...|$|R

High-speed photometry of this system was performed between July, 2010 and August, 2012. Ten new mid-eclipse times were analyzed together with all available eclipse times in the literature. We revisited the (O-C) diagram using a linear ephemeris and verified a clear orbital period variation. On the assumption that these orbital period variations are caused by light travel time effects, the (O-C) diagram {{can be explained by}} the presence of two circumbinary bodies, even though this explanation requires a longer baseline of observations to be fully tested. The orbital periods of the best solution would be P_c ~ 3. 5 years and P_d ~ 6. 9 years. The corresponding projected semi-major axes would be a_c i_c ~ 1. 9 AU and a_d i_d ~ 2. 9 AU. The masses of the external bodies would be M_c ~ 2. 9 M_{Jupiter} and M_d ~ 8. 1 M_{Jupiter}, if we assume their orbits are coplanar with the close binary. Therefore NSVS 14256825 might be composed of a close binary with two circumbinary planets, though the orbital period variations is still open to other <b>interpretations.</b> Comment: <b>16</b> pages, 3 figures, 4 tables.

40|$|The primary {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to develop and improve the experimental method and data interpretation for strain measurements using diffraction methods {{to gain a better understanding}} of micromechanical deformation and anisotropy of lattice strain response. Substantial part of the research was devoted to the development of the laboratory high energy X-ray diffractometer (HEXameter) for bulk residual strain evaluation. White beam energy dispersive X-ray diffraction was chosen as the principal diffraction mode due to its extreme efficiency in utilising X-ray flux and its ability to capture large segments of diffraction patterns. The specimens that have been examined were real engineering components, mechanically deformed specimens and thermally treated specimens, ranging from dynamic in-situ measurements to ex-situ materials engineering. For the real engineering components, a wedge coupon from the trailing edge of a Ti 64 wide fan blade and a turbine combustion casing were examined. Among the mechanically deformed specimens that have been measured were shot-peened steel plates, elasto-plastically bent bars of Mg alloy and cold expanded Al disks. Amongst the thermally deformed specimens, laser-formed steel plates, thermal spray coatings, a manual inert gas weld of Al plates, a friction stir weld of Al plates and Ni tubes and a quenched Ni superalloy cylinder used for strain tomography were studied. In-situ loading experiments have also been carried out, such as experiments on pointwise mapping of grain orientation and strain using the 3 DXRD microscope at the ESRF and in-situ loading experiments on titanium alloy, rheo-diecast and high pressure diecast Mg alloy, IN 718 Ni-base superalloy and Al 2024 aluminium alloy. Experimental results from X-Ray diffraction and strain tomography were used to achieve a better understanding of the material properties. Some results were compared with polycrystal Finite Element model predictions. Amongst the most prominent research achievements are the development on the HEXameter laboratory instrument, including: (i) the development of special collimation systems for the detectors and the source tube; (ii) the development of a twin-detector setup (that allows for simultaneous determination of strain in two mutually orthogonal directions); (iii) improved alignment procedures for better performance; and (iv) the adaptation of instrumentation for efficient scanning of both large and small components, that included choosing and adapting translation devices, programming of the translation system and designing sample mounting procedures. In {{this research}} several approaches to data treatment were investigated. Quantitative phase analysis, single peak fitting (using custom Matlab routines and GSAS) and full pattern fitting (with individual pattern data refined by GSAS and batch refinement done by invoking GSAS via a Matlab routine) were applied.

40|$|We {{consider}} a Wheeler delayed-choice experiment {{based on the}} Mach-Zehnder Interferometer. Since {{the development of the}} causal interpretation of relativistic boson fields there have not been any applications for which the equations of motion for the field have been solved explicitly. Here, we provide perhaps the first application of the causal interpretation of boson fields for which the equations of motion are solved. Specifically, we consider the electromagnetic field. Solving the equations of motion allows us to develop a relativistic causal model of the Wheeler delayed-choice Mach-Zehnder Interferometer. We show explicitly that a photon splits at a beam splitter. We also demonstrate the inherent nonlocal nature of a relativistic quantum field. This is particularly revealed in a which-path measurement where a quantum is nonlocally absorbed from both arms of the interferometer. This feature explains how when a photon is split by a beam splitter it nevertheless registers on a detector in one arm of the interferometer. Bohm et al BDH 85 have argued that a causal model of a Wheeler delayed-choice experiment avoids the paradox of creating or changing history, but they did not provide the details of such a model. The relativistic causal model we develop here serves as a detailed example which demonstrates this point, though our model is in terms of a field picture rather than the particle picture of the Bohm-de Broglie nonrelativistic causal <b>interpretation.</b> Comment: <b>16</b> pages, 1 figur...|$|R

Here we examine a sample of the 8 brightest, single pulsed Fermi bursts whose spectra are modelled by using synchrotron emission as one of the components.

In particular, we investigate the inferred properties of the jet and the physical requirements set by the observed components for these five bursts, {{in the context of a}} baryonic dominated outflow, motivated by the strong photospheric component. We find similar jet properties for all five bursts: the bulk Lorentz factor decreases monotonously over the pulses and lies between 1000 and 100. This evolution is robust and can neither be explained by a varying radiative efficiency nor a varying magnetisation of the jet assuming the photosphere radius is above the coasting radius. Such a behaviour challenges several dissipation mechanisms, e. g., the internal shocks. Furthermore, in all 8 cases the data clearly reject a fast-cooled synchrotron spectrum (in which a significant fraction of the emitting electrons have cooled to energies below the minimum injection energy), inferring a typical electron Lorentz factor of 10 ^ 4 - 10 ^ 7. Such values are much higher than what is typically expected in internal shocks. Therefore, while the synchrotron scenario is not rejected by the data, the interpretation does present several limitations that need to be addressed. Finally, we point out and discuss alternative <b>interpretations.</b> Comment: <b>16</b> pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
