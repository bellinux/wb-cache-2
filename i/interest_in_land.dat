His family considered him to be clever {{and he went to}} study at Christ's College in Cambridge in 1809. Over the next few years he visited the Mediterranean, Scandinavia and Russia, taking a keen <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>land</b> economics. He developed an eye condition during this period and became partially blind, leaving him unable to travel without assistance or to tolerate bright lights, and finding it difficult to read or write.|$|E

The system is meant to redistribute unearned economic rent to the public and improve land use. In 1979, Simon still maintained these ideas and argued that land value tax should replace taxes on wages.|$|E
25|$|Donal Nolan {{has argued}} that to {{consider}} Rylands as part of private nuisance is unsound. Private nuisance requires the claimant to have an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>land,</b> while Rylands does not; although exceptions to this rule have occasionally been made in private nuisance, in Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd, the House of Lords ruled that to make exceptions would transform nuisance from a tort against land to a tort against the person, {{and should not be}} permitted. John Murphy, Professor of Common Law at the University of Manchester, agrees with Nolan, and makes the additional point that nuisance is focused on a loss of enjoyment to land, not physical damage as Rylands is. It has also been concerned that the reasonable use test, which appears in nuisance, is not 9 to cases brought under Rylands.|$|E

After there had become an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>land</b> in western Colorado, a new treaty in 1873 left the Ute with a strip of land in southwestern Colorado between the border with New Mexico and 15 miles north. [...] Most of Mesa Verde lies within this strip of land. The Ute wintered in the warm, deep canyons and found sanctuary there and the high plateaus of Mesa Verde. Believing the cliff dwellings to be sacred ancestral sites, they did not live in the ancient dwellings.|$|E
500|$|The trust {{must then}} be {{formally}} constituted, by {{the transfer of}} its property to the trustees. For chattels, merely handing the property to the trustees is sufficient, assuming it comes with the relevant intention to create a trust. In some circumstances, providing the intention and telling the trustees {{where to find the}} property is sufficient, as in Thomas v Times Books. Where the property is land or an equitable <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>land,</b> it must be transferred by writing in accordance with Sections 52-3 of the Law of Property Act 1925. When dealing with shares, the transfer is not complete until a transfer document has been completed and the company has entered the change of ownership in its books. One of the equitable maxims is that [...] "equity will not assist a volunteer"; if someone does not have an interest in property, they cannot bring a court case. When trusts are not properly constituted, the trustees and beneficiaries have no equitable interest in the property, and so are volunteers. There are several exceptions to this maxim. The courts are willing to hear cases where the transfer was not completed, providing the intended beneficiaries or trustees have gained an interest through being made executor of the settlor's estate (the rule in Strong v Bird), or the gift was given donatio mortis causa, or where the settlor did all he could do, as in Re Rose, or where it would be [...] "unconscionable" [...] to hold the gift invalid, as in Pennington v Waine.|$|E
500|$|... 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925 {{requires}} that [...] "a {{declaration of trust}} respecting any land or any interest therein must be manifested and proved by some writing signed by some person {{who is able to}} declare such trust or by his will". section 53(1)(a) said [...] "no <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>land</b> can be created or disposed of except by writing signed by the person creating or conveying the same, or by his agent thereunto lawfully authorised in writing, or by will, or by operation of law". [...] Two cases, [...] Re Baillie and Ottaway v Norman, have concerned secret trusts over land. In neither case the formality requirements are said to be neglected, but neither judgment expressly considered why 53(1)(a) and 53(1)(b) made an impact that an prima facie express trust could be set up. This has been used to be an argument that secret trusts are constructive but in light of both cases it appears not. However, an express trust may still be exempted from the requirements of 53(1)(a) and 53(1)(b) by a separate application of the equitable maxim [...] "equity will not allow a statute {{to be used as a}} cloak for fraud" [...] the fraud would be for the trustee to deny the existence of the secret trust, but this time the statute concerned would be the Law of Property Act, a line of reasoning dependent upon the case of Rochefoucauld v Boustead. Also, the correct interpretation of secret trust in light of [...] "au dehor" [...] theory strongly affirms that the secret trust can operate outside the Law of Property Act and still be an express trust.|$|E

At the same time land mapping agencies are responsible for recording land parcel dimensions to identify {{the extent of the}} <b>interests.</b> <b>In</b> a theoretical framework, Bennett et al. (2006) analysed the problem of management of <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>land</b> and classified them into three categories. Firstly, some interests have been poorly designed. They may be unenforceable by authorities or may provide little incentive for those who are supposed to adhere to them. Secondly, some interests are poorly administered. The administration system may offer limited public information access, have slow permit and licence processing times, or might be administered in isolation from other related interests. Finally, some interests do not exist where they ought to exist. In a practical context, the parcel based organization of interests mentioned above encounters two problems: the <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>land</b> are not necessarily limited to those mentioned earlier, and the interests are not necessarily restricted to specific parcels. In other words, the <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>land</b> are diverse and some of the interests can not be defined by boundaries. An efficient technical solution for organizing the growing number of <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>land</b> information systems remains a challenge. The solution suggested in this chapter redefines the relationship between <b>land</b> and <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> the context of modern land administration systems.

The party suing was initially one with an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>land,</b> but Perry v Kendricks Transport Ltd confirmed that an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>land</b> was not necessary to bring a claim. Historically, personal injury claims have been allowed, as in Hale v Jennings. More recent cases, however, such as the House of Lords decision in Transco plc v Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council, have confirmed that Rylands is [...] "a remedy for damage to land or interests in land.
