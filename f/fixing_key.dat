40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} whether a commercial knowledge-based treatment planning (KBP) module can efficiently produce IMRT and VMAT plans in the pelvic region (prostate & cervical cancer), and to assess sensitivity of plan quality to training data and model parameters. Methods: Initial benchmarking of KBP was performed using prostate cancer cases. Structures and dose distributions from 40 patients previously treated using a 5 -field IMRT technique were used for model training. Two types of model were created: one excluded statistical outliers (as identified by RapidPlan guidelines) and the other had no exclusions. A separate model for cervix uteri cancer cases was subsequently developed using 37 clinical patients treated for cervical cancer using RapidArcTM VMAT, with no exclusions. The resulting models were then used to generate plans for ten patients from each patient group who had not been included in the modelling process. Comparisons of generated RapidPlans with the corresponding clinical plans were carried out to indicate the required modifications to the models. Model parameters were then iteratively adjusted until plan quality converged with that obtained by experienced planners without KBP. Results: Initial automated model generation settings led to poor conformity, coverage and efficiency compared to clinical plans. Therefore a number of changes to the initial KBP models were required. Before model optimisation, {{it was found that the}} PTV coverage was slightly reduced in the superior and inferior directions for RapidPlan compared with clinical plans and therefore PTV parameters were adjusted to improve coverage. OAR doses were similar for both RapidPlan and clinical plans (p > 0. 05). Excluding outliers had little effect on plan quality (p 0. 05). Manually <b>fixing</b> <b>key</b> optimisation objectives enabled production of clinically acceptable treatment plans without further planner intervention for 9 of 10 prostate test patients and all 10 cervix test patients. Conclusions: The Varian RapidPlanTM system was able to produce IMRT & VMAT treatment plans in the pelvis, in a single optimisation, that had comparable sparing and comparable or better conformity than the original clinically acceptable plans. The system allows for better consistency and efficiency in the treatment planning process and has therefore been adopted clinically within our institute with over 100 patients treated...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{internal}} state size of {{a stream}} cipher {{is supposed to be}} at least twice the key length to provide resistance against the conventional Time-Memory-Data (TMD) tradeoff attacks. This well adopted security criterion seems {{to be one of the}} main obstacles in designing, particularly, ultra lightweight stream ciphers. At FSE 2015, Armknecht and Mikhalev proposed an elegant design philosophy for stream ciphers as <b>fixing</b> the <b>key</b> and dividing the internal states into equivalence classes where any two different keys always produce non-equivalent internal states. The main concern in the design philosophy is to decrease the internal state size without compromising the security against TMD tradeoff at-tacks. If the number of equivalence classes is more than the cardinality of the key space, then the cipher is expected to be resistant against TMD tradeoff attacks even though the internal state (except the <b>fixed</b> <b>key)</b> is of fairly small length. Moreover, Armknecht and Mikhalev presented a new design, which they call Sprout, to embody their philosophy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{about every}} book about cryptography, {{we learn that}} the {{plaintext}} complexity of differential cryptanalysis on DES is 2 47, as reported by Biham and Shamir in [2]. Yet few people realise that in a typical setting this estimation is not exact and too optimistic. In this note we show that the two “best ” differentials for DES used by Biham and Shamir [1, 2], are not the best differentials that exist in DES. For approximations over many rounds such as used in the Biham-Shamir attack from [2], the best characteristic {{is in fact a}} third, different differential already given by Knudsen in [17]). A more detailed analysis shows that on average the best differential attack on DES remains the Biham-Shamir attack from [2], because it can exploit two differentials {{at the same time and}} their propagation probabilities are related. However for a typical <b>fixed</b> DES <b>key,</b> the attack requires on average about 2 48. 34 chosen plaintexts and not 2 47 as initially claimed. In addition, if the key is changing frequently during the attack, then in fact Biham and Shamir initial figure of 2 47 is correct. We were surprised to find out that (with differential cryptanalysis) it is easier to break DES with a changing key, than for one <b>fixed</b> <b>key.</b> Key Words: Block ciphers, Feistel schemes, DES, S-box design, differential cryptanalysis...|$|R

Differential cryptanalysis {{is one of the most}} powerful cryptanalysis techniques: it has not only been applied successfully to many ciphers and hash functions but new attack techniques are derived from it.

However, it was shown for the AES block cipher that two-round differentials are very structured and the number of right pairs that satisfy the differential can be either a power of two or zero. In this thesis, the previous work is extended from two to four rounds and it is shown that a similar structure can still be observed. This thesis also studies lightweight symmetric-key algorithms.
