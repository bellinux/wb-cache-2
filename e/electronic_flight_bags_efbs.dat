According to United Airlines, a conventional paper-based flight bag contains an average of 12,000 sheets of paper per pilot. The airline estimated that deployment of an EFB system running on Apple iPads would save the airline nearly 16 million sheets of paper a year, as well as saving 326,000 gallons of jet fuel due to the reduced weight on board the aircraft.|$|E

The <b>electronic</b> <b>flight</b> <b>bags</b> (<b>EFBs)</b> replaced conventional flight bags full of paper materials that contains an average of 12,000 sheets of paper per pilot, and as a first for major network carriers, provide pilots with paperless aeronautical navigational charts through an iPad app. The green benefits of moving to EFBs include reductions in paper use, printing, and fuel consumption. Distribution of the iPads began in early August 2011, and all pilots were using them by the years end.|$|E

40|$|When <b>Electronic</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Bags</b> (<b>EFBs)</b> {{were first}} {{introduced}} in the cockpit, their major purpose was to replace documents and paper forms which were previously stored in the aircraft or carried by the pilots. Since the early 2000 s commercial airlines have been introducing EFBs in their normal flight operations and they are quickly becoming multi-function devices that allow pilots to calculate aircraft performance figures, display aeronautical charts, access checklists (etc.). Being a relatively new addition to the cockpit, there are not much data available in the literature regarding the impact that EFBs are having in flight safety, specially when used for complex tasks performed under high workload phases of flight. As airlines and aircraft manufacturers seek approval to expand the scope of operational uses of the EFB, {{it is important to}} perform an assessment from a human factors perspective. The aim of this thesis is to assess the influence of the EFB on flight crew workload and safety aspects that endanger a safe flight operation. Furthermore the thesis primarily deals with the Lufthansa EFB. In order to achieve this goal, a focus group of five pilots was formed, who both have practical experience with the EFB and the traditional, paper-based cockpit. Individual, face to face interviews were conducted to gain insights and assessments of the pilots with regard to the objectives of this thesis. After the transcription and analysis of these five guided interviews the EFB can be described as an achievement for today’s flight operation. It could be shown that the implementation of the EFB resulted in a strong reduction in flight crew workload and can be assessed as not critical for the safe flight operation. However, since the EFB has become a substantial component in the cockpit over the last decade, it still has potential for optimization in some areas. This starts with the training, which is not sufficient both in scope and content. Also the Electronic Flight Folder has to be reworked with a view to a more ergonomic design. In addition to the continuous improvement of the application structure or respectivly a more intuitive handling of the system, the deeper integration of the EFB into the cockpit systems would be a future-oriented step and has to be reviewed. Due to the limited time frame of this thesis the elaboration of possible approaches to solutions and further optimization concepts was not the subject of this thesis. This can be worked out by the future researches to further exploit the potential of the EFB...|$|E

Engine reliability in particular, coupled with sophisticated systems for flight path awareness such as Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning Systems (EGPWS), Vertical Situation Displays (VSD's), Head Up Displays (HUD's) and <b>Electronic</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Bags</b> (<b>EFB's),</b> have greatly decreased the prevalence of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents. Inflight loss of control (ILOC) has become far more common than CFIT, often as a result of automation anomalies, failures or mismanagement. With engine failures and fires becoming relatively rare, it is the novel and unexpected events, coupled with human related mismanagement of those events, often through a lack of knowledge and/or expectation, which are weighing on modern accident statistics. A project was completed over 10 weeks at an Australasian Airline, where pilots were encouraged to discuss novel event scenarios. It was hypothesised that discussion of novel events would, in the absence of actual practice, develop a mental plan for the management of such events and also raise levels of expectation for such events.

Usually, X-band weather radars are installed at the nose of civil aircrafts. This band is affected by strong attenuation in case of intense precipitation (liquid or mixed phase).

To address a key step towards the operational deployment of TAP and the NASA concept of Traffic Aware Strategic Aircrew Requests (TASAR), a system evaluation was conducted in a representative flight environment in November, 2013.

In addition, the iPad fs ability to use electronic aeronautical data in lieu of paper in route charts and approach plates can cut the annual cost of paper data in half for commercial airlines. ISS may be able to benefit from this type of trade since one of the most important factors considered is information management. Emergency procedures onboard the ISS are currently available to the crew in paper form. Updates to the emergency books can either be launched on an upcoming visiting vehicle such as a Russian Soyuz flight or printed using the onboard ISS printer.

40|$|The {{competitive}} market will keep asking airlines for better services and lower prices, imposing pressure on costs. Therefore, {{it is important}} for an airline to establish operational standards that will allow an aircraft to be operated more efficiently. The implementation of the Economic Speeds defined by the Cost Index can represent significant operating cost reductions when compared to simply flying Fixed Speeds. Different aircraft models today are equipped with Flight Management Computers (FMC) that are capable of automatically calculating the Economic Speeds based on the Airline Cost Index. In the other hand, several aircraft types manufactured by world leading companies and flown by many airlines around the globe are equipped with FMCs that do not have this capability. Accordingly, this work focuses on the Economic Speeds defined by the Cost Index. More specifically, the Cost Index Methodology is discussed and its fundamentals are applied to the climb phase of the flight. Finally, a methodology for the generation of a practical guidance that allows the determination of the Economic Climb Speed Schedule during the daily operation is presented, allowing an airline with a fleet equipped with FMCs not capable of automatically calculating the Economic Climb Speed Schedule {{to take advantage of the}} potential operating cost reduction. The proposed methodology can be applied on the development of a calculation software to be installed on an <b>Electronic</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Bag</b> (<b>EFB)</b> or to be used for generating data to be sent directly to the flight crew in the cockpit through a Datalink System. In case an EFB or a Datalink System are not an alternative, the proposed methodology leads to the Economic Climb Speed Schedule Table, a practical guidance that allows the flight crew to determine the Economic Climb Speed Schedule for an Airline Cost Index and different conditions of aircraft weight, cruise altitude and speed, with corrections for temperature and wind variations. Since corrections for temperature and wind variations can be understood as a simplification that permits the Economic Climb Speed Schedules to be presented through a table, it is necessary to investigate the impact of this simplification on the optimization. Therefore, the operating costs for an aircraft flying the Economic Climb Speed Schedule calculated for each specific condition is compared with that same aircraft flying the speeds obtained from the suggested Table.

40|$|The results offour piloted medium-fidelity {{simulations}} investigating {{flight deck}} surface trajectory-based operations (STBO) will be reviewed. In these flight deck STBO simulations, commercial transport pilots were given taxi clearances with time and/or speed components and required to taxi to the departing runway or an intermediate traffic intersection. Under {{a variety of}} concept of operations (ConOps) and flight deck information conditions, pilots' ability to taxi {{in compliance with the}} required time of arrival (RTA) at the designated airport location was measured. ConOps and flight deck information conditions explored included: Availability of taxi clearance speed and elapsed time information; Intermediate RTAs at intermediate time constraint points (e. g., intersection traffic flow points); STBO taxi clearances via ATC voice speed commands or datal ink; and, Availability of flight deck display algorithms to reduce STBO RTA error. Flight Deck Implications. Pilot RTA conformance for STBO clearances, in the form of ATC taxi clearances with associated speed requirements, was found to be relatively poor, unless the pilot is required to follow a precise speed and acceleration/deceleration profile. However, following such a precise speed profile results in inordinate head-down tracking of current ground speed, leading to potentially unsafe operations. Mitigating these results, and providing good taxi RTA performance without the associated safety issues, is a flight deck avionics or <b>electronic</b> <b>flight</b> <b>bag</b> (<b>EFB)</b> solution. Such a solution enables pilots to meet the taxi route RTA without moment-by-moment tracking of ground speed. An avionics or EFB "error-nulling" algorithm allows the pilot to view the STBO information when the pilot determines it is necessary and when workload alloys, thus enabling the pilot to spread his/her attention appropriately and strategically on aircraft separation airport navigation, and the many other flight deck tasks concurrently required. Surface Traffic Management (STM) System Implications. The data indicate a number of implications regarding specific parameters for ATC/STM algorithm development. Pilots have a tendency to arrive at RTA points early with slow required speeds, on time for moderate speeds, and late with faster required speeds. This implies that ATC/STM algorithms should operate with middle-range speeds, similar to that of non-STBO taxi performance. Route length has a related effect: Long taxi routes increase the earliness with slow speeds and the lateness with faster speeds. This is likely due to the" open-loop" nature of the task in which the speed error compounds over a longer time with longer routes. Results showed that this may be mitigated by imposing a small number oftime constraint points each with their own RTAs effectively tuming a long route into a series of shorter routes - and thus improving RTA performance. STBO ConOps Implications. Most important is the impact that these data have for NextGen STM system ConOps development. The results of these experiments imply that it is not reasonable to expect pilots to taxi under a "Full STBO" ConOps in which pilots are expected to be at a predictable (x,y) airport location for every time (t). An STBO ConOps with a small number of intermediate time constraint points and the departing runway, however, is feasible, but only with flight deck equipage enabling the use of a display similar to the "error-nulling algorithm/display" tested...|$|R
40|$|As the {{avionics}} {{industry is}} seeking to introduce touch screens into most flight decks, {{it is vital to}} understand the interactional challenges and benefits of doing so. The potential benefits and challenges of touch screen technology on flight decks was investigated by means of a variety of qualitative and quantitative research methods (mixed methods approach). A number of research questions are addressed, which have been iteratively developed from the literature, interviews with avionics experts and pilots. This work presents one field study, two lab studies, one observational study, one simulation study and one comparative user study, all investigating various factors/variables that could affect touch screen usability on the flight deck. The first field study investigated interactive displays on the flight deck with search and rescue (SAR) crew members in an operational setting in helicopters. This was the first in-flight experiment where touch screens were evaluated under real conditions. The results showed the impact of target size, device placement and in-flight vibration on targeting accuracy and performance. Presented statistical analyses and observations are essential to understand how to design effective touch screen interfaces for the flight deck. One of the lab studies evaluated (more in depth) the potential impact of display position of touch screens within a simulated cockpit. This was the first experiment that investigated the impact of various display positions on performance following Fitts’ Law experiment. Results revealed that display location has a significant impact on touch screen usability. Qualitative findings from semi-structured interviews and post-experiment questionnaires supported the understanding of interactional issues on a flight deck environment which extended initial design guidelines. Pilots brought attention to the impact of increased G-force (+Gz) as an additional environmental factor that might affect touch screen usability on agile aircrafts. Therefore, a Fitts’ law experiment was conducted to understand the effect of +Gz on touch screen usability. +Gz conditions were simulated with a weight-adjustable wristband, which was the first approach to simulate increased G-force in lab environment. Empirical results and subjective ratings showed a large impact of +Gz on performance and fatigue indices. An observational study focused on <b>Electronic</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Bag</b> (<b>EFB)</b> (mobile device) usage on the specific domain of Search and Rescue (SAR) helicopters. The novelty in this study was the focus group in which the aim was to find features, content and functionality that a SAR pilot may wish to see in an EFB. From operational observations and interviews with pilot’s operational requirements were defined. A Digital Human Modelling Software was used to define physical constraints of an EFB and develop interface design guidelines. A scenario and virtual prototype was created and presented to pilots. A new way of interaction to manipulate radio frequencies of avionics systems was developed based on findings achieved in this work and other relevant studies. A usability experiment simulating departures and approaches to airports was used to evaluate the interface and compare it with the current system (Flight Management System). In addition, interviews with pilots were conducted to find out their personal impressions and to reveal problem areas of the interface. Analyses of task completion time and error rates showed that the touch interface is significantly faster and less prone to user input errors than the conventional input method (via physical or virtual keypad). Potential problem areas were identified and an improved interface is suggested. Overall, the main contribution of this research is a framework showing the relation between various aspects that could impact the usability of touch screens on the flight deck. Furthermore, design guidelines were developed that should support the usability of interactive displays on the flight deck. This work concludes with a preliminary questionnaire that can help avionic designers to evaluate whether a touch screen is an appropriate user interface for their system...|$|R
