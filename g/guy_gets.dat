500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2007 when asked about politics he said, [...] "I'd been unemployed all my life. It {{was a big deal}} for me when they (Labour) got in. Now David Cameron is no different from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown is no different from David Cameron. They're all cut from the same cloth and it annoys me that the biggest political icon in the last 30 years has been Margaret Thatcher. Someone who tried to destroy the working class. It freaks me out. So I don't really think there's anything left to vote for. I believe that I, as a person, can only change things once every 5 years and that's by voting, and my point is that even casting that vote means that the same <b>guy</b> <b>gets</b> in, the only difference is one has a red tie and the other has a blue one." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] lyrically {{discusses}} feminism; {{the song}} criticizes [...] "common" [...] gender-related double standards, {{in which men}} are applauded for their sexual behaviors, while women who behave {{in a similar fashion}} are disdained. In the book Therapeutic Uses of Rap and Hip-Hop, Susan Hadley and George Yancy discuss that [...] "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] is a hip hop song that [...] "encourages young women to be proud, strong, and empowered to be all that they can be". At the song's first verse, Aguilera sings [...] "Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind / Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled"; she later rejects that all women [...] "should be seen, not heard" [...] and encourages them to [...] "shout louder" [...] during the chorus. Aguilera comments on the double standard with the lyrics [...] "The <b>guy</b> <b>gets</b> all the glory the more he can score / While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore". Lil' Kim shares a similar sentiment during her verse in the bridge, questioning why a man is able to give a woman [...] "some sex or sex her raw" [...] while [...] "if the girl do the same and then she's a whore".|$|E

500|$|Harrison Ford reprises {{the role}} of Dr. Henry [...] "Indiana" [...] Jones, Jr. To prepare for the role, the 64-year-old Ford spent {{three hours a day}} at a gym, practiced with the bullwhip for two weeks, and relied on a high-protein diet of fish and vegetables. Ford had kept fit during the series' hiatus anyway, as he hoped for another film. He {{performed}} many of his own stunts because stunt technology had become safer since 1989, and he also felt it improved his performance. It is also said that he still fit into his pants from Raiders of the Lost Ark. He argued, [...] "The appeal of Indiana Jones isn't his youth but his imagination, his resourcefulness. His physicality {{is a big part of}} it, especially the way he gets out of tight situations. But it's not all hitting people and falling from high places. My ambition in action is to have the audience look straight in the face of character and not at the back of a capable stuntman's head. I hope to continue that no matter how old I get." [...] Ford felt his return would reduce U.S. ageism (he refused to dye his hair for the role), because of the film's family appeal: [...] "This is a movie which is geared not to [...] segment of the demographic, an age-defined segment ... We've got a great shot at breaking the movie demographic constraints." [...] He told Koepp to add more references to his age in the script. Spielberg said Ford was not too old to play Indiana: [...] "When a <b>guy</b> <b>gets</b> to be that age and he still packs the same punch, and he still runs just as fast and climbs just as high, he's gonna be breathing a little heavier at the end of the set piece. And I felt, 'Let's have some fun with that. Let's not hide that. Spielberg recalled the line in Raiders that said, [...] "It's not the years, it's the mileage," [...] and felt he could not tell the difference between Ford during the shoots for Last Crusade and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.|$|E

Ron Jeremy has commented on the pay scale {{of women and men}} in the sex film industry: in 2003 [...] "Girls can easily make 100-250k per year, plus stuff on the side like strip shows and appearances. The average male makes $40,000 a year." [...] and in 2008, [...] "The average <b>guy</b> <b>gets</b> $300 to $400 a scene, or $100 to $200 if he's new. A woman makes $100,000 to $250,000 {{at the end of the}} year." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 12 {{against the}} Athletics, Demeter hit {{a grand slam}} and had 7 RBI, tying a career high. However, the great moment couldn't be celebrated long as the next night against the Angels ended with Demeter being carried off the field in a {{stretcher}} and hospitalized overnight after a pitch in the fifth inning from California pitcher Dean Chance struck him in the head, resulting in two missed games. Demeter suffered another injury on August 27 at Los Angeles, damaging his left wrist while {{trying to make a}} diving catch on a line drive hit by Jimmy Piersall. After 12 X-rays, it was finally determined to be a sprain and not a broken wrist as originally diagnosed. It was the same wrist he broke in 1961 during his tenure with the Dodgers. Several key players were injured at the time, leading Demeter to remark, [...] "I really feel sick for Charlie (Dressen). The poor <b>guy</b> <b>gets</b> his team where it can make a move and then injuries hit him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fellow Penguin {{teammate}} Bill Guerin also analyzed Cooke's hit on Savard to Pittsburgh reporters. [...] "If a <b>guy</b> <b>gets</b> {{hurt like}} that with a shot to the head, there's got to be something," [...] said Guerin, adding that he expected Cooke to be suspended. [...] "I understand he (Cooke) is on my team but, hey, he's in a tough spot." [...] In a ruling, which has received wide criticism, Cooke was not given a suspension for the hit on Savard. On March 24, {{in response to the}} outcry over Cooke not being suspended, the league implemented a new rule aimed at prohibiting blindside hits to the head like the one Cooke delivered to Savard. In announcing the rule, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said, [...] "The elimination of these types of hits should significantly reduce the number of injuries, including concussions, without adversely affecting the level of physicality in the game." [...] Earlier, Bettman appeared on Leafs Lunch on Mojo 640 in Toronto to discuss the Cooke hit on Savard. [...] "I was very unhappy and upset with that hit," [...] said Bettman. [...] "I was more upset there was nothing (in the League rules) to do to punish it." ...|$|E
