40|$|Steel {{has been}} the {{material}} of choice for automobile manufacturers. In the recent years material such as aluminium and its alloys are taking over the market because of their light weight. The use of aluminium, in automobile manufacturing can result in overall fuel efficiency. Spot welding aluminium alloys require higher electric power and less welding time as compared to steel. Welding guns that can produce an electric current which is approximately 2 to 3 times higher, as compared to steel are required for spot welding aluminium. An efficient method of spot welding Aluminium alloys with the preheating process has been proposed in this paper. Preheating Aluminium sheet before spot welding reduces the thermal and electrical resistance which brings down the <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> <b>requirement</b> to spot weld Aluminium structures. Both spot welding and induction preheating process have been modelled in this paper. The test results of the preheating process have also been verified with practical heating trials. The preheating is performed on-the-fly in advance to spot welding process. The results show that spot welding Al 6082 after preheating up to 200 degrees C, the output current requirements to make the spot weld are reduced by 22 %. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{growth of}} fatigue crack in {{aluminum}} alloy, 6061 -T 6, under {{the application of}} pulsed <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> was studied. To {{examine the effect of}} pulsed <b>electric</b> <b>current,</b> different <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> densities were used at different fatigue cycles, where the <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> densities were subjected as 90 A/mm 2 and 150 A/mm 2. With the <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> density of 90 A/mm 2, the fatigue life was increased. However, when the current density levels became higher, that is, 150 A/mm 2, the fatigue life was decreased. From the fracture surface observations, the local melting was found on crack surface. It is concluded that the increase of fatigue life is attributed to the crack shielding effect resulted from the local melting induced by the pulsed <b>electric</b> <b>current.</b> In addition, the effect of pulsed <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> was more remarkable in small crack region...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{investigates the}} grain {{refinement}} in solidifying Al- 7 wt%Si hypoeutectic alloy driven by <b>electric</b> <b>currents.</b> The {{grain size reduction}} in alloys generated by <b>electric</b> <b>currents</b> during the solidification has been intensively investigated. However, since various effects of <b>electric</b> <b>currents</b> {{have the potential to}} generate the finer equiaxed grains, it is still argued which effect plays the key role in the grain refinement process. In addition, the knowledge about the grain refinement mechanism under the application of <b>electric</b> <b>currents</b> remains fragmentary and inconsistent. Hence, the research objectives of the present thesis focus on the role of <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> effects and the grain refinement mechanism under the application of <b>electric</b> <b>currents.</b> Chapter 1 presents an introduction with respect to the subject of grain refinement in alloys driven by <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> during the solidification process in particular, including the research objectives; the research motivation; a brief review about the research history; a short introduction on the <b>electric</b> <b>currents</b> effects and a review relevant to the research status of grain refinement mechanism. Chapter 2 gives a description of research methods. This chapter shows the employed experiment materials, experimental setup, experimental procedure, the analysis methods of solidified samples, and numerical method, respectively. Chapter 3 focuses on the role of <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> effects in the grain refinement process. A series of solidification experiments are performed under various values of effective <b>electric</b> <b>currents</b> for both, <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> pulse and direct current. The corresponding temperature measurements and flow measurements are carried out with the increase of effective <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> intensity. Meanwhile, numerical simulations are conducted to present the details of the flow structure and the distribution of <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> density and electromagnetic force. Finally, the role of <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> effects is discussed to find the key effect in the grain refinement driven by <b>electric</b> <b>currents.</b> Chapter 4 investigates the grain refinement mechanism driven by <b>electric</b> <b>currents.</b> This chapter mainly focuses on the origin of finer equiaxed grain for grain refinement under the application of <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> on account {{of the importance of the}} origin for understanding the grain refinement mechanism. A series of solidification experiments are carried out in Al- 7 wt%Si alloy and in high purity aluminum. The main origin of equiaxed grain for grain refinement is concluded based on the experiment results. Chapter 5 presents three further investigations based on the achieved knowledge in chapter 3 and 4 about the role of <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> effects and the grain refinement mechanism. According to the insight into the key <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> effect for the grain refinement shown in chapter 3, this chapter presents a potential approach to promote the grain refinement. In addition, the solute distribution under the influence of <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> is examined based on the knowledge about the <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> effects. Moreover, the grain refinement mechanism under application of travelling magnetic field is investigated by performing a series of solidification experiments to compare with the experiments about the grain refinement mechanism driven by <b>electric</b> <b>currents</b> shown in chapter 4.

40|$|The {{elongated}} droplets {{and grains}} can break up into smaller ones. This process {{is driven by}} the interfacial free energy minimization, which gives rise to a breakup limit. We demonstrated in this work that the breakup limit can be overpassed drastically by using <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> to interfere. <b>Electric</b> <b>current</b> free energy is dependent on the microstructure configuration. The breakup causes the <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> free energy to reduce in some cases.

The <b>electric</b> <b>current</b> gives rise to two states, i. e., uniform and uneven Joule heat. These two states must be considered to analyze the heat conduction problem.
