50|$|During the Middle Ages, {{which lasted}} from about the 5th century through the 15th century, the Roman Catholic Church {{replaced}} the Roman Empire as the unifying force in Europe. It used the Latin language and preserved the classics of Latin literature. In addition, {{the influence of}} the Church on the spread of literacy, has {{had a significant impact on}} European society. <b>Günther</b> <b>S.</b> Wegener has carefully documented the correlation between Bible translation and the spread of literacy in European languages. In fact, during the Middle Ages, the most important branch of learning was theology (the study of God). This new intellectual approach has been called Scholasticism. Italy, in virtue of this, became a seat of great formal learning in 1088 with the establishment of the University of Bologna, the first university in Europe.

Because of the wide variation in certain numerical scale characters within one taxon or even within one population, these characters (used by many authors as key characters to separate taxa) are not regarded as very important.

30|$|Neural {{networks}} can {{be utilized}} {{as an asset}} {{to the construction of}} cryptosystems. An application is found in the context of key exchange and generation. For the sake of keeping data confidential, cryptosystems use either a single shared key or a public-private key to achieve encryption and decryption. By the 1990 <b>s,</b> <b>Günther</b> suggested forward secrecy unto key agreement protocols [15]. It entails the generation of a unique private key for each session initiated for station-to-station communications. That way, if the secure communication is compromised, only the data from that specific session would be affected. In neural networks, a stochastic pattern of synaptic weights is generated after a learning session is completed which can be used as keys. Reinitializing a neural network creates a new stream of synaptic weights fitted for a cryptosystem that refreshes its keys for every session. The mechanisms to perform a successful neural key exchange protocol rely on the key generation, the key management procedures, and the neural network architecture to achieve both.|$|R
40|$|I) Introduction p-Conjugated {{polymers}} inherently combine electronic {{properties of}} inorganic semiconductor crystals and material characteristics of organic plastics {{due to their}} special molecular design. This unique combination has led to developing new unconventional optoelectronic technologies and, further, resulted {{in the evolution of}} semiconducting polymers (SCPs) as fundamental components for novel electronic devices, such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic solar cells (OSCs). [1 – 5] Moreover, the material flexibility, capability for thin-film formation, and solution processibility additionally allow utilizing modern printing technologies for the large-scale fabrication of flexible, light-weight organic electronics. This especially enables to significantly increase the production speed and, moreover, to drastically reduce the costs per unit. [6, 7] In particular, transistors are the most important elements in modern functional electronic devices because of acting as electronic switches in logic circuits or in displays to control pixels. However, due to molecular arrangement and interactions, the electronic performance of SCPs cannot compete with the one of monocrystalline silicon which is used in state-of-the-art high-performance microtechnology. [5, 8] Nonetheless, intensive and continuing efforts of scientists focused on improving the performance of OFETs, with the special focus on the charge carrier mobility, by optimizing the polymer structure, processing conditions and OFET device architecture. By this, it was possible to identify crucial relationships between polymer structure, optoelectronic properties, microstructure, and OFET performance. [8] Nowadays, the interdisciplinary scientific success is represented by high-performance SCPs with charge carrier mobilities exceeding the value of amorphous silicon. [3, 9] However, further research is essential to enable developing the next generation of electronic devices for application in healthcare, safety technology, transportation, and communication. II) Objective and Results Within the scope of this doctoral thesis, current high-performance p-conjugated SCPs should be studied comprehensively to improve the present understanding about the interdependency between molecular structure, material properties and charge transport. Therefore, the extensive research approaches focused on different key aspects of high charge carrier mobility polymers for organic transistors. The performed investigations comprised the impact of, first, novel design concepts, second, precise structural modifications and, third, synthetic and processing conditions and led to the major findings listed below. 1. The design concept of tuning the p-conjugation length allows to gradually modulate physical material properties and demonstrates that a strong localization of frontier molecular orbitals in combination {{with a high degree of}} thin-film ordering can provide a favorable platform for charge transport in p-conjugated semiconducting polymers. [1] 2. The replacement of thiophene units with thiazoles in naphthalene diimide-based p- conjugated polymers allows to increase interchain interactions and to lower frontier molecular orbitals. This compensates the potentially detrimental enhancement of backbone torsion and drives the charge transport to unipolar electron transport, whereas mobility values are partially comparable with those of the respective thiophene containing analogs. 3. p-Conjugated diketopyrrolo[3, 4 -c]pyrrole-based copolymers can be synthesized within fifteen minutes what, in combination with avoiding aqueous washings and optimizing processing conditions, allowed an increase in morphological and energetic order and, thus, improved the charge transport properties significantly. III) Conclusion The key findings of this doctoral thesis provide new significant insights into important aspects of designing, synthesizing and processing high charge carrier mobility polymers. By this, they can guide future research to further improve the performance of organic electronic devices - decisive for driving the development and fabrication of smart, functional and wearable next-generation electronics.

Professor Schlegel in his book entitled “Handleiding tot de beoefening der Dierkunde, 1857, Deel I”, says “In the Borneo-specimens of Gymnura rafflesii the “whole body is variegated with white”, and Dr. <b>Günther,</b> P. Z. <b>S.</b> L. 1876, p. 425, speaking from the Borneo-form, which he distinguished s. n. Gymnura rafflesii, var: candida states, »all the specimens received from Labuan dif“fer from the typical form in being of a white colour, “only a part of the longest and strongest hairs on the “trunk being black. The head, legs and tail are pure “white. As no structural differences can be discovered “either in the skull, or dentition, or any other part of “the body, I consider it sufficient to distinguish this form “as a merely local variety. ” As I returned home I examited what we possess in our collection of the named species and found two dark colored specimens, one from Sumatra, Padang-bessie, collected by the late S. Müller, the other from Malacca and an albino-specimen from Borneo, many years ago sent over by the late Dr. Schwaner; and further two complete skeletons, one of the Sumatra-specimen, the other of the Borneo-individual. In comparing these skeletons I soon saw that they presented many differences and now, having closely studied and compared them, I do not hesitate to say that we have here to do with two distinct species. I will shortly explain the differences, which I have observed. In the skull of the Borneo-specimen the molars and canines have not yet attained their full growth, while in the other all the teeth are well developed, and although the former must for this reason be regarded as a younger individual, it is nevertheless larger and its skeleton is much stouter in all its forms and dimensions. In both of them the number of vertebra and costae is the same, viz: 15 dorsales with 15 ribs, 5 lumbares, 5 sacrales and 26 caudales. The skull of the Borneo-specimen is of a more elongate form, and less broad than in the Sumatra-specimen...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{through which}} fibrous amphiboles may {{give rise to}} mesothelioma is still not completely understood. Several factors have been taken into account, and these include the morphological aspect (length:width ratio), the chemical composition, {{and a variety of}} surface properties which are ultimately responsible for the mineral-cellule interactions (e. g. van Oss et al., 1999). Studies in vitro demonstrate that the morphology of the fiber has a strong role in determining its biological danger, because very thin and long crystallites are hardly eliminated by the alveolar macrophages. However, a second factor which seems to influence the biological attack of a fiber is its Fe content; iron can in fact be involved in complex biochemical reactions with oxygen and cause DNA damages. It follows that the rapid determination of the chemical composition of a fiber, and of its Mg/Fe ratio in particular, is extremely important in environmental studies. The direct analysis can be achieved only by micro-chemical tools such as by EDS- or WDS-equipped electron microscopes. However, these techniques are extremely expensive and often unsuitable when dealing with extremely fibrous (diameter 2 + at the OH-coordinated M(1, 3) sites (Della Ventura et al. 1996, 1997, Iezzi et al. 2005, 2007). The digitized spectra were fitted by interactive optimization followed by least-squares refinement; all bands were modelled as symmetric Gaussians. Della Ventura et al. (1996, 1997) showed that the binary site-occupancies at M(1) and M(3) in the amphibole structure are related to the observed intensities of the four (A to D) components in the principal IR OH-stretching spectrum. Using the original equations of Burns and Strens (1966) : M(1, 3) Mg = 3 I A + 2 I B + I C and M(1, 3) M 2 + = I B + 2 I C + 3 I D (with M 2 + = Fe 2 +) where I A -I D are the intensities measured for the corresponding A to D bands, one can derive the (Mg, M 2 +) site populations at M(1, 3) {{with a high degree of}} confidence. This method is particularly suitable for asbestiform materials which cannot be properly characterized by EMP. The present work shows that the above spectroscopic tool can be applied to a large variety of amphibole types. For species were significant (Mg, Fe) are present at M(4) (i. e. anthophyllite –cummingtonite - grunerite) an additional information (e. g. Mössbauer) is however required for a complete characterization of the sample. References Burns, R. G. and Strens, R. G. J. (1966) Science, 153, 890 - 892.

Several factors have been taken into account, and these include the morphological aspect of the fiber, the chemical composition, {{and a variety of}} surface properties which are ultimately responsible for the mineral-cellule interactions[1]. Studies in vitro demonstrate that the morphology of the fiber has a strong role in determining its biological danger, because very thin and long crystallites are hardly eliminated by the alveolar macrophages. However, recent studied show that lung injury after asbestos exposure is associated with an oxidative stress that is catalyzed by iron in the fiber[2]. It follows that the rapid determination of the chemical composition of asbestiform amphiboles, and of its Mg/Fe ratio in particular, is extremely important in environmental studies. The direct analysis can be achieved only by micro-chemical tools such as by EDS- or WDS-equipped electron microscopes. However, these techniques are extremely expensive and often unsuitable when dealing with extremely fibrous (diameter < 3 µm) materials. Therefore a rapid and easily accessible method is highly desirable in large scale environmental monitoring. The best alternative to EMPA is provided by FTIR spectroscopy, a technique which can be used on both single crystals (down to few µm in dimension) and powders. Here we present the results of a new calibration based on the analysis of a large set of well-characterized fibrous and prismatic natural amphiboles spanning a very large variety of chemical compositions and geological occurrences. All samples were previously studied using X-ray diffraction and EMPA. FTIR spectra in the principal OH-stretching region were collected on KBr disks prepared with a mineral:matrix = 5 : 150 mg ratio. Most spectra show four prominent bands which can be assigned to the combination of Mg and F 2 + at the OH-coordinated M(1, 3) sites[3, 4, 5, 6]. The digitized spectra were fitted by interactive optimization followed by least-squares refinement; all bands were modelled as symmetric Gaussians. [3, 4] showed that the binary site-occupancies at M(1) and M(3) in the amphibole structure are related to the observed intensities of the four (A to D) components in the principal IR OH-stretching spectrum. Using the original equations of [7]: M(1, 3) Mg = 3 IA + 2 IB + IC and M(1, 3) M 2 + = IB + 2 IC + 3 ID (with M 2 + = Fe 2 +) where IA-ID are the intensities measured for the corresponding A to D bands, one can derive the (Mg, M 2 +) site populations at M(1, 3) {{with a high degree of}} confidence. This method is particularly suitable for asbestiform materials which cannot be properly characterized by EMP.
