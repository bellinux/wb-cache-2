2500|$|With {{his newly}} {{consolidated}} {{place in the}} nobility of Portugal, Afonso commenced {{what would be a}} highly successful political and social career. In 1415 he took part in the Conquest of Ceuta, alongside his father, his brothers, and the leading members of the nobility and military. By the time of his father's death in 1433, Afonso had won favour with his brother, King Duarte I and the rest of high Portuguese society. With his brother's premature death in 1438, a regency was established for Afonso's nephew, the 6year old King Afonso V, under the leadership of the king's mother, Leonor of Aragon, and later Afonso's brother, Infante Pedro, Duke of Coimbra. The Duke of Coimbra's regency, however, soon proved unpopular and Afonso quickly became the King's preferred advisor. On 30 December 1442, the Duke of Coimbra, still the King's regent and thus acting in his name, created Afonso as the Duke of Braganza, as a gesture of good will and reconciliation between the two brothers.

50|$|Christ Episcopal Church is a {{historic}} Episcopal church located at Chaptico, St. Mary's County, Maryland, United States. It was constructed in 1736 of Flemish bond brick construction with glazed headers, 60 feet long and 40 feet wide, with an original semicircular brick apse. In 1913, a three-story brick tower with octagonal belfry and spire {{was added to the}} west end of the church. The building was constructed under the supervision of Philip Key, vestryman, who was the grandfather of Francis Scott Key. The building was heavily damaged on July 30, 1814, during the War of 1812, when an admiral of the British fleet came ashore and took possession of the village of Chaptico.

5000|$|Thurzó or Turzo (German; Thurzó; Turzo; Turzonowie) was a Hungarian noble {{family from}} the 15th century to {{the first half of}} the 17th century. It was in Kraków (Cracow) that the rise of the Thurzó family began, and the family in turn boosted that city into an {{important}} center of business, science, and Renaissance high culture. The family's long-term involvement in capitalist enterprises, high-level politics, the affairs of the Church, and its patronage of the arts made the family rich, famous and powerful well beyond the city. Its achievements resembled the Medici family in Italy and France, perhaps the Fugger family in Germany. <b>Key</b> <b>family</b> patriarchs were Johann Thurzó (1437-1508) and his sons Johann (1466-1520), bishop of Breslau/Wroclaw, and Stanislaus (1471-1540), bishop of Olmütz/Olomouc. Karen Lambrecht argues that the family's most important role was in facilitating [...] "intercultural communications." [...] That is they used their vast network of friends, clients and allies to introduce new concepts in the arts, facilitate the exchange of ideas among scientists, and open contacts among different high status social groups.|$|E

5000|$|SFT utilizes, {{not only}} a special systems terminology, but also a means of {{depicting}} <b>key</b> <b>family</b> parameters diagrammatically. Its {{focus is on the}} structure of the family, including its various substructures. In this regard, Minuchin is a follower of systems and communication theory, since his structures are defined by transactions among interrelated systems within the family. He subscribes to the systems notions of wholeness and equifinality, both of which are critical to his notion of change. An essential trait of SFT is that the therapist actually enters, or [...] "joins", with the family system as a catalyst for positive change. Joining with a family is a goal of the therapist early on in his or her therapeutic relationship with the family.Structural and Strategic therapy are important therapeutic models to identify as many therapists use these models as the bases for treatment. Each model has its own approach using different ways in conceptualizing a problem and developing treatment plans that support the goals stated for therapy. In addition, theory-based treatment plans are the source for goal development and treatment options by identifying the presenting problem and social influences. Both these models use similar approaches and define goals with various therapeutic processes that begin with the building of therapist and client relationship. In addition, diversity and theory are identified as a major component in choosing a theory that addresses diversity issues.|$|E
