5|$|On March 11, 2000, <b>Giuliani</b> <b>and</b> Clinton met {{face-to-face}} for {{the first}} time since the campaigning began, at the New York Inner Circle press dinner, an annual event in which New York politicians and the press corps stage skits, roast each other and make fun of themselves, with proceeds going to charity.|$|E
5|$|New York Congresswoman Nita Lowey was the {{candidate}} first {{expected to be}} the Democratic nominee, while other mentioned possible candidates included Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Andrew Cuomo, New York State Comptroller Carl McCall, and New York Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney. State Democratic figures were concerned that neither Lowey nor the others had the star power to rival <b>Giuliani,</b> <b>and</b> that the seat would be lost.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans chose lesser-known Congressman Rick Lazio {{to replace}} him. The {{election}} included a record $90 million in campaign expenditures between Clinton, Lazio, and <b>Giuliani</b> <b>and</b> national visibility. Clinton showed strength in normally Republican upstate areas and a debate blunder by Lazio solidified Clinton's previously shaky support among women. Clinton {{won the election}} in November 2000 with 55percent of the vote to Lazio's 43percent.|$|E

5|$|The race {{began in}} November 1998 when four-term {{incumbent}} New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement. Both the Democratic Party and Republican Party sought high-profile candidates {{to compete for}} the open seat. By early 1999 Clinton and Mayor of New York City Rudolph Giuliani were the likely respective nominees. Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, purchased a house in Chappaqua, New York, in September 1999; she thereby became eligible for the election, although she faced characterizations of carpetbagging since she had never resided in the state before. The lead in statewide polls swung from Clinton to <b>Giuliani</b> <b>and</b> back to Clinton as the campaigns featured both successful strategies and mistakes as well as dealing with current events. In late April and May 2000, Giuliani's medical, romantic, marital, and political lives all collided in a tumultuous four-week period, culminating in his withdrawing from the race on May 19.|$|E
