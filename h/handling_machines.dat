5|$|After {{years of}} {{persistence}} and attempts at marketing, Evans's designs were finally given a trial on larger scales and adopted elsewhere. A breakthrough came in 1789 when the Ellicotts, a progressively minded Quaker family in Baltimore, invited Evans to refit their mills on the Patapsco River. The refits proved a success, and Evans worked with Jonathan Ellicott {{to develop a}} modified form of Archimedean screw that could act as a horizontal conveyor to work alongside the vertically orientated bucket elevators. He added a rake-drill and conveyor belt to his designs, and now possessed {{a full complement of}} materials <b>handling</b> <b>machines</b> for just about every possible configuration. In 1790, Evans moved from Newport to Wilmington and constructed a working model of his designs in the town. Evans's inventions were given a major boost when leading miller Joseph Tatnall converted his mills to the Evans system, and estimated that in one year the changes saved his operation a small fortune amounting to $37,000. Local millers quickly followed suit, and Brandywine Village was soon a showcase for Evans's milling technology. After almost a decade, the Brandywine millers were finally convinced, and within a short period automated mills began to spread across the eastern seaboard. In 1790, upon introduction of federal patent law, Evans immediately applied for protection for his milling designs and was granted the third US patent, with his application personally examined and approved by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of War Henry Knox, and Attorney-General Edmund Randolph.|$|E

The head men of Japan are dreaming ambitiously, and the people are dreaming blindly, a Napoleonic dream. And to this dream the Japanese clings and will cling with bull-dog tenacity. The soldier shouting [...] "Nippon, Banzai!" [...] on the walls of Wiju, the widow at home in her paper house committing suicide so that her only son, her sole support, may go to the front, are both expressing the unanimity of the dream.|$|E

50|$|In {{subsequent}} years, {{the network}} of communication enterprises was significantly expanded, especially in rural areas. In the cities a network of liaison offices, post offices and subordinate communication centres was established, combining postal, telegraph and telephone services into a single entity, with offices typically located {{in the same building}} and under single management. A huge network of mailboxes was established, installed not only in cities but also in rural areas, stations, railway sidings and at highway intersections. Further development of the postal service followed the path of mechanization and automation of mail processing, improving the organization of its transportation and delivery. For this the old postal equipment was modernized, along with development of mechanized mail processing and <b>handling</b> <b>machines</b> and equipment for container transport and postal inventory, as well as equipment for customer service.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fighting}} {{machines are}} described in Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds and depicted on the album artwork painted by Michael Trim. This version of the tripods does have major inconsistencies when compared to Wells' description in the novel; for example, the heat-ray emanates from a proboscis in the cupola rather than from a camera-like box carried by an articulated arm on the tripod, the basket to hold captured humans is a cage on the <b>handling</b> <b>machines</b> instead of the fighting machines, and the [...] "cowl" [...] (cockpit) of the fighting machine is fixed in place, {{instead of being a}} separately moving hood. The three legs of the fighting machine have fixed joints and stiff legs rather than the jointless, free-flowing organic legs described in Wells' novel. They are also described in the prologues of the live stage versions as being modified versions of similar walking machines the Martians use on Mars.|$|E
5000|$|Tripods have a large, free-moving head {{atop the}} smaller main body, giving its sole Martian {{occupant}} a panoramic view. It has four thick, metallic tentacles, which are held on high, {{made up of}} boxy-looking segments, making them appear like large bicycle chains rather than slim and whip-like, as described in Wells' novel; they are used mainly to capture humans during the film. The tripods have three long, ridged, and stilt-like legs, which occasionally stride with the right and rear leg moving forward together in a clumsy, unconvincing manner. The heat-ray sits atop the tripod [...] "head" [...] and has a round, spinning mirror on a metallic arm; when the mirror rotates rapidly, it emits a long-range heat-ray. The deadly chemical black smoke is emitted from {{the tips of the}} thick tentacles {{in the form of a}} spray, instead of the novel's gun-like device that fires canisters of the deadly gas over distances. The fighting machines each have a collecting basket for storing captured humans, but in the film it looks more like a standard solid metal bucket. There are other Martian machines seen in the film: a four-legged fighting machine and six-legged <b>handling</b> <b>machines</b> that somewhat resemble scorpions.|$|E
5000|$|By 1960, {{the area}} around Water Street had been {{acquired}} by the city via eminent domain to build the Westinghouse Building, and this necessitated an eventual move to Parkway Center in the Pittsburgh suburb of Greentree, as the very first tenant. Heyl & Patterson participated in a high-profile project for the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh - the Civic Arena. Applying technology normally used for ore bridges and other bulk material <b>handling</b> <b>machines,</b> Heyl & Patterson designed and manufactured the trucks, gear motors and 480-volt AC motor drive that opened and closed the arena roof. A total of 42 trucks mounted on 78 wheels, 30 of which were individually driven, supported and moved the six moveable sections on the largest stainless steel dome in the world. [...] In 1961, Heyl & Patterson opened its Florida Operations Division with an office and fabrication plant on Merritt Island near Cocoa Beach, Florida, {{at the entrance to}} Kennedy Space Center. Florida Operations would serve the aerospace community at Cape Canaveral, and developed a system of blast deflectors for the space program launch pads. Later in the decade, Heyl & Patterson opened a Service Center in Charleston, West Virginia as a warehouse to stock spare parts.|$|E

Sakura is very loyal to SGS and keeps her feelings for Satoru to herself. She and Souta frequently fight Shizuka of the Wind. In the Boukenger movie, Sakura is also revealed to have a fear of bugs. In Task 26, it is revealed that she ran away from her parents and joined a special army school to find her destiny, and when she first met Satoru and he asked her to join the other Boukengers in the shooting gallery. She may seem very cold-headed and insensitive to a certain point but in Task 31, after Eiji was badly injured by Gai, Sakura's emotional self showed after being enraged by the cruelty and treachery of Gai. After the final battle with Gajya, Sakura stowed away on GoGo Voyager when Satoru left the Boukenger team to take on a new adventure in outer space with her new-found treasure: her smile. However, while exploring planet Isla, Sakura is possessed by the released Pachacamac XII, who uses her as both a host and as a hostage to ensure Satoru aids him willingly in gaining his ancestor's power. Once freed of the monster's control, Sakura aids her team and the Gekirangers in defeating Pachacamac. Since the series finale, Sakura calls Satoru by his real name, and not by [...] "Chief".|$|E
