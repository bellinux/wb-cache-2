5000|$|European health {{agencies}} have warned against consuming high amounts of cassia bark, {{one of the}} four main species of cinnamon, because of its coumarin content. According to the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BFR), 1 kg of (cassia) cinnamon powder contains about 2.1 to 4.4 g of coumarin. [...] Powdered cassia cinnamon weighs 0.56 g/cm3, so a kilogram of cassia cinnamon powder equals 362.29 teaspoons. One teaspoon of cassia cinnamon powder therefore contains 5.8 to 12.1 mg of coumarin, which may be above the tolerable daily <b>intake</b> <b>value</b> for smaller individuals. However, the BFR only cautions against high daily intake of foods containing coumarin.

40|$|Background. For over a decade, solid tannery waste {{has been}} {{converted}} into protein concentrate and used as a feed ingredient because of its cheap availability. However, as chromium sulfate is commonly used in the tanning process, the chromium (Cr) content of tanned skin-cut wastes (SCW) may enter the edible parts of poultry through feed. Therefore, {{there is a chance}} that Cr and other heavy metals may be present in the edible portion of poultry and consequently transfer to humans upon poultry consumption. Objectives. In this study, skin-cut wastes (SCW) -based poultry feed and the edible parts of chicken fed with this feed were analyzed to understand the potential health risks of their use as poultry feed. Methods. In the present study, the presence of heavy metal content in SCW, poultry feed, and edible portions of different kinds of chicken was determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometer methods and the associated health risk estimation was calculated by comparing the target hazard quotient (THQ) value and reference daily <b>intake</b> <b>value.</b> Results. The results revealed the presence of Cr content ranging from 0. 12 – 3. 11 mg/kg and lead (Pb) content ranging from 8. 06 – 22. 0 mg/kg in SCW. In addition, Cr and Pb were present in the range of 0. 27 – 0. 98 mg/kg and 10. 27 – 10. 36 mg/kg, respectively, in poultry feed. However, no cadmium (Cd) was found in SCW, but the presence of Cd ranged from 0. 03 – 0. 05 mg/kg in feed. When contaminated poultry feed was fed to live poultry, the presence of Cr, Pb and Cd was observed in the edible portions (i. e. skin, liver, gizzard, and meat). Irrespective of the edible parts and chicken type, Cr values ranged from 0. 1 – 2. 440 mg/kg; Pb values ranged from 0. 257 – 1. 750 mg/kg; and Cd values ranged from below detection limit (BDL) to 0. 037 mg/kg. Conclusions. The estimated daily <b>intake</b> <b>value,</b> THQ, along with the aggregate hazard index value, indicated a potential risk to consumers through consumption of contaminated chicken. Therefore, the study results clearly demonstrate heavy metals accumulation in chicken due to feeding SCW-based feed. The contaminated chicken further transfers these heavy metals to humans through ingestion. Hence, there is a potential human health risk through consumption of contaminated chicken meat...|$|E

Results corroborated the dearth of relevant factorial data, including whole-diet bioavailability data, and confirmed the need to continue extrapolating physiological requirements across population groups. Data were also unavailable that would allow reference values to be based on selected health outcomes associated with iron intake or status. Ideally, a series of observational and randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies need to be undertaken across all population groups and life stages to generate robust data for setting dietary reference values for iron.

40|$|Lead (Pb) is a {{ubiquitous}} element. The {{transport of}} Pb into components of environment is from natural and anthropogenic sources. Pb, {{in the form}} of organic and inorganic compounds, is toxic for human. Human exposure is realised particularly by oral way but an exposure by inhalation is also possible. The prenatal development and children’s age are especially sensitive developmental periods of human regarding Pb exposure. Tetraethyl lead as a petrol additive has not been used in the SR since 1995, thereby the improvement of environmental quality has occurred and subsequently Pb concentrations decreased in other components of environment. However, the environment in the SR is affected by distance transport of Pb and existing sources from incinerators and metallurgical industry. Due to the volume of imported food and its total consumption, the Pb intake from food and then human exposure in the SR are also affected by imported food.

An internally studentized residual ≤ - 1. 71 was characterized as a negative deviation from predicted LFI value (DEV). Total DEV during lactation ranged from 0 occurrences up to 14 negative deviations. However, the occurrence of more than 5 deviations during lactation was rare, and reproductive performance was not statistically affected by additional negative deviations. Twenty-one day litter weaning weight decreased with each additional negative deviation until at least 3 negative deviations occurred in which litter weaning weight remained at a constant value for litters produced by purebred and F 1 sows. Wean-to-service interval remained constant when 0, 1, or 2 negative deviations occurred but when the number of negative deviations during lactation reached at least 3, wean-to-service interval began to increase.

40|$|The {{transfer}} of microcystins (MC) {{up the food}} chain was measured in 4 lakes in central Sweden; Ekoln, Lilla Ullfjärden, Valloxen, and Storsjön. In lakes Ekoln and Valloxen, Microcystis aeruginosa was the dominant cyano-bacterium, while the oscillatorian species Planktothrix prolifica form dense blooms in Lake Lilla Ullfjärden. The cyanobacterial composition in Lake Storsjön was more diverse with several Microcystis and Dolichospermum species. All dominant taxa are well-known producers of hepatotoxic MC. The highest recorded MC in the water samples from Lake Lilla Ullfjärden was measured in the bloom of P. prolifica (35 µg L− 1). The highest MC content was measured in invertebrates; however, the MC concentration was usually low in fish. Maximum levels were 9 µg g− 1 dry weight (dw) in zooplankton, 10 µg g− 1 dw in benthos, and 2. 7 µg g− 1 dw in fish (smelt) liver. In fish muscle the highest recorded levels were 0. 10 – 0. 18 µg g− 1 dw in bleak and smelt from Lake Lilla Ullfjärden and in pike-perch and roach from Lake Storsjön.

Our objective is to compare validity of self-reported energy intake obtained by three dietary assessment methods with total energy expenditure (TEE) obtained by doubly labeled water (DLW) among Brazilian women. Design We used a cross-sectional study. Subjects/setting Sixty-five females aged 18 to 57 years (28 normal-weight, 10 over-weight, and 27 obese) were recruited from two universities to participate. Main outcome measures TEE determined by DLW, energy intake estimated by three 24 -hour recalls, 3 -day food record, and a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Statistical analyses performed Regression and analysis of variance with repeated measures compared TEE and energy <b>intake</b> <b>values,</b> and energy intake-to-TEE ratios and energy intake-TEE values between dietary assessment methods. Bland and Altman plots were provided for each method. chi(2) test compared proportion of underreporters between the methods. Results Mean TEE was 2, 622 kcal (standard deviation [SD] = 490 kcal), while mean energy intake was 2, 078 kcal (SD= 430 kcal) for the diet recalls; 2, 044 kcal (SD= 479 kcal) for the food record and 1, 984 kcal (SD= 832 kcal) for the FFQ (all energy <b>intake</b> <b>values</b> significantly differed from TEE; P< 0. 0001).

In particular, priority was given to data from winter-based RCT performed at latitudes > 49 • 58 °N (n 12). A combined weighted linear model meta-regression analyses of natural log (Ln) total vitamin D intake (i. e. diet and supplemental vitamin D) versus achieved serum 25 (OH) D in winter (that used by the North American Dietary Reference Intake Committee) produced a curvilinear relationship (mean (95 % lower CI) serum 25 (OH) D (nmol/l) = 9 • 2 (8 • 5) Ln (total vitamin D)). Use of non-transformed total vitamin D intake data (maximum 1400 IU/d; 35 µg/d) provided for a more linear relationship (mean serum 25 (OH) D (nmol/l) = 0 • 044 × (total vitamin D) + 33 • 035). Although inputting an intake of 600 IU/d (i. e. the RDA) into the 95 % lower CI curvilinear and linear models predicted a serum 25 (OH) D of 54 • 4 and 55 • 2 nmol/l, respectively, the total vitamin D intake that would achieve 50 (and 40) nmol/l serum 25 (OH) D was 359 (111) and 480 (260) IU/d, respectively.

The Panel concluded that these data were insufficient for setting DRVs for phosphorus. Data on the calcium to phosphorus ratio in bones of healthy adults, adjusted for the proportion of phosphorus found outside bone, and data on whole-body calcium and phosphorus contents in Caucasian adults indicate that the calcium to phosphorus molar ratio in the body ranges from 1. 4 : 1 to 1. 9 : 1. Although the fractional absorption of phosphorus is {{higher than that of}} calcium, the Panel considered that the actual amounts of calcium and phosphorus that are available for absorption from the diet cannot be determined; therefore, the whole-body calcium to phosphorus ratio was used to set DRVs. The data were considered insufficient to derive Average Requirements and Population Reference Intakes. Based on the DRVs for calcium and considering a molar calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1. 4 : 1 to 1. 9 : 1, amounts of phosphorus were calculated. The Panel chose the lower bound of this range (a ratio of 1. 4 : 1, which results in a higher phosphorus <b>intake</b> <b>value)</b> for setting an Adequate Intake (AI), taking into account estimated phosphorus intakes in Wester...|$|E
40|$|Temporal {{change of}} {{seawater}} and fresh water interface in the watershed area needs scientific study on dynamics of ecosystem parameters in different seasons {{and analysis of}} satellite imagery. This research aims to assess the change of interface seawater and freshwater from the temporal estuary upstream. The study used four methods: (1) Interviews with local community respondents; determined with snowball method. (2) Secondary data obtained from the Report of Environmental Monitoring Result of Power Plant Operations of Asam – Asam in 2014 (3) Observed parameters include pH, salinity, electrical conductivity in the dry season (August), transition (October) and rainy season (December). (4) Temporal observations {{with the use of}} satellite imagery analysis with Nipah (Nypa fruticans Wurmb) as indicator. According to the respondent, seawater intrusion has occurred extremely from the estuary of Asam-Asam river to the upstream. Secondary data shows significant differences in the <b>intake</b> <b>value</b> of DHL Asam-Asam power plant (546 μ mhos/cm) with upstream intake (231 μ mhos/cm) which means the intrusion of sea water is moderate to high level. Field observations show the dry season (August 2013) interface was 12. 86 miles from the estuary, whereas in transitional season (October 2013) was 12. 53 miles from estuary, and rainy season (December 2013) is 5. 24 km from the estuary. Satellite imagery showed the interface in 1991 was 8. 13 miles from the estuary and increase upstream from 0. 03 to 1. 86 per year. In 2014, the interfac...|$|E

Average DM, CP, ash and cell wall phenolics concentrations inWPwere {{higher than in}} LPS by 1. 53, 33. 65, 1. 47 and 96. 15 %, respectively. In contrast, average NDF, ADF, ADL, cellulose and hemicellulose concentrations of LPS were higher than in WP by 1. 73, 1. 87, 2. 93, 1. 19 and 1. 44 %, respectively. DailyDMintake by sheep fed SBS 2 (WP; 36. 2 g kg BW) was lower (P 0. 05) average <b>intake</b> <b>value</b> of 41. 8 kg BW 0. 75. Corresponding (P > 0. 05) average daily CP intake by sheep fed SBS 1, SBS 2 and SBS 3 (WP; 5. 1 g kg BW 0. 75 was higher (P < 0. 05) than the CP intake of sheep fed SBS 1, SBS 2 and SBS 3 (LPS). Neutral detergent fibre digestibility values of 3 SBS (WP) and N-retention coefficient of 3 SBS (WP) were significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than the values obtained from the 3 SBS (LPS). It is concluded that leaf-pruning has no significant beneficial effect on the feeding of soybean stovers to sheep...|$|E
40|$|A nationwide, seven-day food {{consumption}} survey of 371 preschool {{children between the}} ages of birth and five years indicated that a direct linear relationship existed between age and increased dietary lead intake from foods consumed. Daily dietary lead intake averaged 62 micrograms and ranged from 15 micrograms to 234 micrograms. The various levels of lead intake were attributed to frequency of consumption of food items, quantity of food consumed, and the lead content of particular food items. To account for variation in the quantity of food consumed by the various children, average lead intake per 500 kilocalories consumed and per 500 g of food consumed was calculated. When these standardization procedures were followed, an equalization in the average daily dietary lead <b>intake</b> <b>values</b> was observed among the various aged children...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} used a {{systematic}} review approach to identify relevant randomised control trials (RCT) with vitamin D and then apply meta-regression {{to explore the}} most appropriate model of the vitamin D intake–serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) relationship to underpin setting reference <b>intake</b> <b>values.</b> Methods included an updated structured search on Ovid MEDLINE; rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria; data extraction; and meta-regression (using different model constructs). In particular, priority was given to data from winter-based RCT performed at latitudes > 49 • 58 °N (n 12). A combined weighted linear model meta-regression analyses of natural log (Ln) total vitamin D intake (i. e. diet and supplemental vitamin D) versus achieved serum 25 (OH) D in winter (that used by the North American Dietary Reference Intake Committee) produced a curvilinear relationship (mean (95...|$|R
40|$|Heavy metal {{contamination}} of soils is widespread and induces a long-term risk to ecosystem health. This {{research focuses on}} the heavy metal contamination, transfer values and risk assessment in the Kočani Field plant system (Republic of Macedonia). To identify the heavy metal concentrations in Kocˇani crops (rice and maize), the geochemical analysis was performed by inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometer and thereupon the transfer factor (TF) and estimated daily <b>intake</b> amount <b>values</b> were calculated. The highest As, Cd, Mo, Pb and Zn values were determined in the rice samples grown in the paddy fields near the Zletovska River. The highest Pb and Mo concentrations measured in the maize samples were from the maize fields near the Zletovska River and Ciflik city. High TF values for Mo, Zn, Cd and Cu revealed a strong accumulation of Mo, Zn and Cd by rice and Mo and Zn by maize crops. The results of the estimated daily intake showed that the regular consumption of rice and maize crops containing the highest Cd, Mo, Pb and Zn concentrations could pose {{a serious threat to}} human health, because the daily intake of Cd, Mo, Pb and Zn for crops grown in the fields around the Zletovska River exceeded the recommended provisional tolerable daily <b>intake</b> <b>values.</b> Taking into account the results, the area around Zletovska River is considered as the most anthropogenically impacted part of Kočani Field...|$|R
