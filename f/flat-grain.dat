The company's puzzle boxes, trays and tea {{canisters}} {{were sold}} at Gump's in San Francisco, the New York Museum of Modern Art, the Chicago Art Institute and other boutiques and retailers nationwide. Four years later Smith & Fong converted a Chinese tea-processing plant to produce bamboo flooring and {{worked out a}} distribution agreement with a Bay Area-based flooring distributor. Under the name Plyboo, Smith & Fong was the first company to bring bamboo flooring to the US market. The first product was an amber <b>flat-grain</b> flooring that is still in stock today. In 1996 Angus Stocks joined Smith & Fong as an equity partner. The company leased its own space and took possession of its inventory. A second color of bamboo flooring (natural) was added, and the company introduced architectural-grade bamboo plywood to the marketplace. Smith & Fong incorporated in 1997 and spent {{the remainder of the}} 1990s adding more bamboo flooring and plywood options to its Plyboo offerings. In 2000 the company launched bamboo strand flooring; in 2001 Smith & Fong introduced coconut palm plywood and flooring under the Durapalm brand, and bamboo plywood production moved to a 4’x8’ dimension.|$|E
