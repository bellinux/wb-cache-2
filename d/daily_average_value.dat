This study was performed in two naturally ventilated schools located in the same municipality. First school is located in urban area, at residential - industrial site, while the other school is situated in rural area. School buildings were chosen based on their urban environment features. The measurements were carried out in heating as well as in non-heating period in duration of five consecutive working days. The objective {{of the study was to}} analyze IAQ in the classrooms with special emphasis on levels and diurnal variations of particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2. 5), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) in occupied and unoccupied school classrooms. In this paper, the CO 2 concentrations were measured at both indoor and outdoor environments. Concentrations of CO 2 higher than 1000 ppm were regularly detected in the classrooms during teaching hours. Indoor concentrations of PM 10 were not exceeded the guideline, <b>daily</b> <b>average,</b> <b>value</b> of 50 μg/m 3.

40|$|The {{spectral}} light-absorbing {{behavior of}} carbonaceous aerosols {{varies depending on}} the chemical composition {{and structure of the}} particles. A new single-cavity three-wavelength photoacoustic spectrometer was developed and characterized for measuring absorption coefficients at three wavelengths across the visible spectral range. In laboratory studies, several types of soot with different organic content were generated by a diffusion flame burner and were investigated for changes in mass-specific absorption cross section (MAC) values, absorption and scattering Angstrom exponents (alpha(abs) and alpha(sca)), and single scattering albedo (omega). By increasing the organic carbonaceous (OC) content of the aerosol from 50 to 90 % of the total carbonaceous mass, for 660 nm nearly no change of MAC was found with increasing OC content. In contrast, for 532 nm a significant increase, and for 445 nm a strong increase of MAC was found with increasing OC content of the aerosol. Depending on the OC content, the Angstrom exponents of absorption and scattering as well as the single scattering albedo increased. These laboratory results were compared to a field study at a traffic-dominated urban site, which was also influenced by residential wood combustion.

These inventories are inserted, in conjunction with meteorological data, into the Source Complex model for Short Term Dispersion (ISCST 4. 5) to predict ambient ground level concentrations of sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) at selected receptors for years 2001 and 2004. The comparison of the results obtained for these two years show the influence of increase in emission rates due to urban and industrial growth. For model validation, computed results are compared with the measured <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> <b>values</b> of SO 2 and NOx collected at a fixed Kuwait Environment Protection Agency air quality monitoring station located at the roof of polyclinic in Rabia.

Solar UV radiation variability in different time scales and its fractional composition in the global solar radiation (G), that is, FUV = UV/G is investigated under different sky conditions. The maximum daily UV solar irradiation (HdUV) was 0. 85 MJ m 2 and the annual average 0. 55 MJ m 2. It was noticed that the largest contribution to the annual variation of the daily totals of UV are attributed to cloudiness than seasonality.

40|$|A {{compilation}} of daily extreme temperatures recorded at the Fabra Observatory (Catalonia, NE Spain) since 1917 up to 2005 has permitted an exhaustive {{analysis of the}} fractal behaviour of the daily extreme temperature residuals, DTR, defined as {{the difference between the}} observed daily extreme temperature and the <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> <b>value.</b> The lacunarity characterises the lag distribution on the residual series for several thresholds. Hurst, H, and Hausdorff, Ha, exponents, together with the exponent beta of the decaying power law, describing the evolution of power spectral density with frequency, permit to characterise the persistence, antipersistence or randomness of the residual series. The self-affine character of DTR series is verified, and additionally, they are simulated by means of fractional Gaussian noise, fGn. The reconstruction theorem leads to the quantification of the complexity (correlation dimension, mu*, and Kolmogorov entropy, kappa.) and predictive instability (Lyapunov exponents, lambda, and Kaplan-Yorke dimension, D-KY) of the residual series. All fractal parameters are computed for consecutive and independent segments of 5 -year lengths. This strategy permits to obtain a high enough number of fractal parameter samples to estimate time trends, including their statistical significance. Comparisons are made between results of predictive algorithms based on fGn models and an autoregressive autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) process, with the latter leading to slightly better results than the former. Several dynamic atmospheric mechanisms and local effects, such as local topography and vicinity to the Mediterranean coast, are proposed to explain the complex and instable predictability of DTR series. The memory of the physical system (Kolmogorov entropy) would be attributed to the interaction with the Mediterranean Sea. Postprint (published version...|$|E

In this paper the mathematical models that describe the dispersion of nitrogen dioxide emitted from the two thermal power stations (Center CET and South CET) of Timisoara city as a function of four meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed) are presented.

40|$|An extreme haze event {{occurred}} in the Beijing area from 17 to 23 December 2015. Ground-based measurements and satellite observations during this event were used to further {{our understanding of the}} formation process of haze pollution and aerosol optical properties. The results suggest that high relative humidity, poor diffusion conditions (low wind speed and stable stratification) and favorable secondary transformation conditions under the hygroscopic growth of aerosol and high emissions led to this serious haze episode. During the haze period, the <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> <b>value</b> was 1. 15 and 0. 42 for aerosol optical depth (AOD 500 nm) and columnar water-vapor (CWV, in cm), respectively. On 19 December, the correlation coefficient between CWV and AOD 500 nm was 0. 91, indicating the effect of hygroscopic growth of fine-mode articles. The daily average values for Ångström exponent, fine-mode fraction, aerosol absorption optical depth, and Ångström absorption exponent were 1. 19, 0. 81, 0. 11 and 1. 47, respectively, which suggests that fine aerosol particles were dominant in the atmosphere and fine-mode particles were the dominant contributor to atmospheric extinction during the haze period. Moreover, it also reflects that there were more absorbing aerosol particles during the haze period. Compared with other polluted periods with a bimodal distribution, there was an obvious trimodal distribution on 19 December. There were three peaks at radii of about 0. 1 μm, 0. 5 – 0. 8 μm and 4 μm. Satellite observations show that there was an obvious aerosol layer in the Beijing area during the haze period, concentrated at ground level to within 2 km in the upper layers.

30|$|For comparison, the OH {{equivalent}} temperature, {{which is}} the atmospheric temperature weighted by the vertical profile of OH volume emission rate obtained by the SABER observations, is plotted in Fig. 3 (diamonds). Each value of OH equivalent temperature is given as a mean of typically three or four tangential points within a 500 -km distance of Syowa Station. Since SABER passes closely over Syowa Station twice a day in its ascending and descending orbit, the universal time (UT) of these data points is also derived by averaging. The typical sampling times above Syowa Station in this period are 13 – 14 UT and 22 – 23 UT for ascending and descending orbits, respectively. The mean distance of these data points from Syowa Station is about 200 km. The numbers located near the diamond symbols specify the number of SABER profiles {{used to calculate the}} <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> <b>value</b> and UT. The process used to derive OH equivalent temperature and the altitude profiles of atmospheric temperature and OH volume emission rates is as follows. First, the averaged profiles of temperature and OH volume emission rates are calculated by an equal weighting of three to four soundings. Then, two profiles of OH volume emission rate of two SABER channels are normalized with integrated emission rates through the OH layer. The two SABER OH VER channels are at 1.6 µm, which mostly includes the OH (4 - 2) and OH (5 - 3) bands, and 2.0 µm, which mostly includes the OH (8 - 6) and OH (9 - 7) bands. These two altitude profiles are combined and averaged to obtain the weighting function. Finally, these weighting functions are combined with the altitude profiles of temperature to obtain OH equivalent temperatures. Good agreement between the OH rotational and equivalent temperatures is seen except on DOY 128. A possible reason for this difference is the effect of unknown local heating or a horizontal inhomogeneity of temperature because the field of view of SABER is not necessarily {{the same as that of}} the ground-based observation.|$|E

The climate that prevails inside the building affects human and animal health and welfare, as well as productivity, while emissions from the building contribute to environmental pollution. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the variation of two climatic parameters (namely temperature and relative humidity) and the levels of particulate matter of different sizes (PM 10 -PM 2. 5 -PM 1), as well as the relationships between them, inside a typical Greek naturally ventilated livestock building that hosts mainly sheep. The concentration of particles was recorded during a 45 -day period (27 / 11 - 10 / 1), while temperature and relative humidity were observed during an almost 1 -year period. The analysis revealed that the variation of outdoor weather conditions significantly influenced the indoor environment, as temperature and relative humidity inside the building varied in accordance to the outside climate conditions. Temperature remained higher indoors than outdoors during the winter and extremely low values were not recorded inside the building. However, the tolerable relative humidity levels recommended by the International Commission of Agricultural Engineering (CIGR) were fulfilled only in 47 % of the hours during the almost 1 -year period that was examined. This fact indicates that although temperature was satisfactorily controlled, the control of relative humidity was deficient. The concentration of particulate matter was increased during the cold winter days due to poor ventilation. The maximum <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> <b>value</b> of PM 10, PM 2. 5 and PM 1 concentration equaled to 363, 61 and 30 mu g/m(3) respectively. The concentration of the coarse particles was strongly influenced by the farming activities that were daily taking place in the building, the dust resuspension being considered as the dominant source. A significant part of the fine particles were secondary, which the production of could be attributed to an increase in relative humidity levels. It is concluded that measures have to be adopted in order to achieve sufficient ventilation and to reduce particulate matter levels...|$|E

At the same time it is increasingly common with self-producers of heat and electricity generation. The main purpose with this master thesis is to investigate how time resolution affects the environmental assessment of energy consumption in office buildings connected to district heating (DH). Environmental assessments were done with both attributional LCA and consequential LCA with system expansion. Fortum´s DH system in Stockholm was analyzed and district heating production was simulated in a Matlab-model. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the production were calculated. The heat demand of the office Gångaren 16 in Stockholm was simulated in IDA ICE.

The results show that the highest time resolution that should be used for environmental assessment of energy consumption in buildings connected to DH is <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> <b>values,</b> regardless of LCA perspective. Moreover, sufficient results are achieved with yearly <b>average</b> <b>values</b> with attributional LCA.

After the Equilibrin or acupuncture treatments each patient had four weeks of no treatment for thearapy adjustment. The evaluation of the therapy was done with headache diaries and questionnaires. From the data analysis {{we can say that}} neither the Equilibrin-Monotherapy for 2 months nor the also 2 months lasting acupuncture treatment showed significant headache improvements.

However, during these winter seasons, the obtained soil CO 2 flux was as low as 0  g m− 2 day− 1 even when the measurement succeeded (Fig.  3). This low value was likely related to snow and soil frost, which made CO 2 not ascend in a shallow zone of the ground. The maximum soil CO 2 flux was observed in August 2016, and soil CO 2 flux at a comparable level was also found in August 2017 (Fig.  3). Soil CO 2 flux variations related to the Kumamoto earthquake (16 April 2016) were not evident. Minima in soil CO 2 flux occurred during June–July 2016, and a small increase in the <b>daily</b> <b>average</b> <b>values</b> was recorded during November–December 2016.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{measurement}} {{data regarding}} the influent and effluent of {{wastewater treatment plant}} (WWTP) provides a general overview, demonstrating an overall performance of WWTP. Nevertheless, these data do not provide the suitable operational information for the optimization of individual units involved in a WWTP. A full-scale evolution of WWTP {{was carried out in}} this study via a reconciled data. Methods: A full-scale evolution of acrylonitrile, butadiene and styrene (ABS) resin manufacturing WWTP was carried out. Data reconciliation technique was employed to fulfil the mass conservation law and also enhance the accuracy of the flow measurements. <b>Daily</b> <b>average</b> <b>values</b> from long-term measurements by the WWTP library along with the results of four sampling runs, were utilized for data reconciliation with further performance evaluation and characterization of WWTP.

40|$|This {{collection}} contains two separate {{sets of data}} files, two data keys, and a technical write-up. One set of data files contains the entire record from Station Papa, while the other contains <b>daily</b> <b>averaged</b> <b>values</b> of wind speed and wave height only. The data key files contain notes about the quality control activities that were conducted {{as well as the}} units of the data. The technical write-up details some of the issues encountered while developing the final product and the methods used to quality control certain values. From 1951 to 1981, the Canadian Weathership Program collected almost continuous measurements at Station Papa (50 N, 145 W) in the North Pacific. The data from this program was recently rediscovered by contemporary oceanographers conducting research at Station Papa. This dataset was subjected to a rigorous analysis designed to determine its efficacy as a scientific tool. The results of that analysis are the datasets posted here. Mary Gates Endowmen...|$|R
40|$|We study solar wind–ionosphere {{coupling}} {{through the}} late declining phase/solar minimum and geomagnetic minimum phases during the last solar cycle (SC 23) – 2008 and 2009. This interval was characterized by sequences of high-speed solar wind streams (HSSs). The concomitant geomagnetic response was moderate geomagnetic storms and high-intensity, long-duration continuous auroral activity (HILDCAA) events. The JPL Global Ionospheric Map (GIM) software and the GPS total electron content (TEC) database were {{used to calculate the}} vertical TEC (VTEC) and estimate <b>daily</b> <b>averaged</b> <b>values</b> in separate latitude and local time ranges. Our results show distinct low- and mid-latitude VTEC responses to HSSs during this interval, with the low-latitude daytime <b>daily</b> <b>averaged</b> <b>values</b> increasing by up to 33 TECU (annual average of ~ 20 TECU) near local noon (12 : 00 to 14 : 00 LT) in 2008. In 2009 during the minimum geomagnetic activity (MGA) interval, the response to HSSs was a maximum of ~ 30 TECU increases with a slightly lower <b>average</b> <b>value</b> than in 2008. There was a weak nighttime ionospheric response to the HSSs. A well-studied solar cycle declining phase interval, 10 – 22 October 2003, was analyzed for comparative purposes, with daytime low-latitude VTEC peak values of up to ~ 58 TECU (event average of ~ 55 TECU). The ionospheric VTEC changes during 2008 – 2009 were similar but ~ 60 % less intense on average. There is an evidence of correlations of filtered <b>daily</b> <b>averaged</b> VTEC data with Ap index and solar wind speed. We use the infrared NO and CO 2 emission data obtained with SABER on TIMED as a proxy for the radiation balance of the thermosphere. It is shown that infrared emissions increase during HSS events possibly due to increased energy input into the auroral region associated with HILDCAAs. The 2008 – 2009 HSS intervals were ~ 85 % less intense than the 2003 early declining phase event, with annual <b>averages</b> of <b>daily</b> infrared NO emission power of ~ 3. 3 &times; 10 10 W and 2. 7 &times; 10 10 W in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The roles of disturbance dynamos caused by high-latitude winds (due to particle precipitation and Joule heating in the auroral zones) and of prompt penetrating electric fields (PPEFs) in the solar wind–ionosphere coupling during these intervals are discussed. A correlation between geoeffective interplanetary electric field components and HSS intervals is shown. Both PPEF and disturbance dynamo mechanisms could play important roles in solar wind–ionosphere coupling during prolonged (up to days) external driving within HILDCAA intervals...|$|R
