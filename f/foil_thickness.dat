50|$|The energy {{resolution}} obtained from this detector {{is better than}} a silicon detector when using ion beams heavier than helium ions. There are various designs of ionization detectors but a general schematic of the detector consists of a transversal field ionization chamber with a Frisch grid positioned between anode and cathode electrodes. The anode is subdivided into two plates separated by a specific distance. From the anode, signals ∆E(energy lost), Erest(residual energy after loss), and Etot (the total energy Etot= ΔΕ+Erest) as well as the atomic number Z can be deduced. For this specific design, the gas used was isobutane at pressures of 20-90 mbar with a flow rate that was electronically controlled, the previous figure. A polypropylene foil was used as the entrance window. It has to be noted that the <b>foil</b> <b>thickness</b> homogeneity is of more importance for the detector {{energy resolution}} than the absolute thickness. If heavy ions are used and detected, the effect of energy loss straggling will be easily surpassed by the energy loss variation, which is a direct consequence of different foil thicknesses.

Four main parameters affecting the bending accuracy of the micro W-bent parts were considered: <b>foil</b> <b>thickness,</b> grain size, foil orientation and punching frequency. Based on Taguchi L 8 orthogonal array (OA), a micro-sheet-metal forming machine equipped with W-shaped punch and die was used to conduct the micro W-bending experiments.

It was identified that the extent of the effect by these parameters on the micro W-bending process depends on springback behaviours. The <b>foil</b> <b>thickness</b> had highest influence on the springback amount of the bent parts. However, the negative springback was influenced mostly by the grain size, closely followed by the <b>foil</b> <b>thickness.</b> Furthermore, the optimum bending conditions for different types of the springback were obtained.
