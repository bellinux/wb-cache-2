40|$|Innovation seldom has purely {{domestic}} {{causes and}} consequences, {{but how can}} a <b>European</b> <b>innovation</b> policy complement or substitute national policies? Taking the subsidiarity principle as a starting point, this report discusses the economic rationale of a <b>European</b> <b>innovation</b> policy. Explorative empirical analysis suggests that public R&D and public funding of private R&D are subject to economies of scale and external effects. This is an argument in favour of a <b>European</b> <b>innovation</b> policy but amongst other things, the heterogeneity in social economic objectives on public R&D spending between Member States pleas for national government involvement. In addition, there are scale economies in the protection of intellectual property and {{in the development of}} standards. We conclude that a <b>European</b> <b>innovation</b> policy could have, or already has, substantial benefits over purely national policy in these areas. With respect to innovation policies targeted at SMEs, we do not find economies of scale or external effects. It seems to be efficient that these policies are mainly conducted at the national level. ...|$|R

Using the framework we show how the Eastern <b>European</b> <b>innovation</b> systems have, because of past legacies and international policy transfer, developed a highly specific understanding of innovation policy based on the initial impact of the Washington Consensus policies and later the European Union.

In order to test the hypotheses raised in the Thesis Plan, two separate phases were designed. On the first part, the work tests hypotheses 1 and partially 2, identifying the quality, depth and limitations of three famous complex indicator-based systems, namely the Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard, the <b>European</b> <b>Innovation</b> Scoreboard 2008 and Innovation Union Scoreboard 2010. On the second phase, the remaining hypotheses are tested adding media databases analysis, which will provide complementary information to a set of interviews to policy makers, in order to understand the role of the composite indicators on technology decisions. composite indicators, innovation, technology policy decisions, <b>European</b> <b>Innovation</b> Scoreboard, Innovation Union Scoreboard...|$|R

Economic theory perceives innovation as a source of national competitiveness and the EU set the ability to compete within the single market as the main economic criterion for EU accession. Through the use of EIS indicators we are able to compare and rank Croatia’s achievements in innovation policy against EU and Central and Eastern Europe countries (CEEC). Croatia ranks well by European standards in comparison to other CEEC, in particular Bulgaria and Romania, but has not made a significant progress in its innovation potential and policy with respect to the EU. innovation policy, national <b>innovation</b> system, <b>European</b> Union integration processes, knowledge-based society, <b>European</b> <b>Innovation</b> Scoreboard, Community Innovation Survey, Croatia...|$|R
