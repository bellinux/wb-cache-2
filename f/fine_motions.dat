Performing assembly operations with a dexterous hand, high level strategies for planning a manipulation task have to be implemented. Pre-grasping operations depend highly on a good position/velocity control. The control strategies for position and velocity which are used for the Dexterous Hand of LIFIA/INRIA and the Karlsruhe Dexterous Hand will be introduced. Force control is needed for a stable and secure grasp and for dextrous manipulation. Once the required forces are available, force control strategies could be applied for grasping and manipulating the object.

40|$|Abstract: Manipulators {{are often}} {{required}} to perform small amplitude, slow motions with very high precision. For hydraulic manipulators these <b>fine</b> <b>motions</b> are difficult to execute due to high nonlinear joint friction found in these systems. Poor tracking, stick-slip behavior, and large static position errors often occur. Current methods proposed to improve the performance of hydraulic manipulators require complex modeling and identification and often produce marginal results. Here, a control scheme based on feedback from a base-mounted force/torque sensor is presented. The theoretical background for the method is presented, and an easy to implement simplified form is developed, based on quasi-static equations. Experimental results for a Schilling Titan II industrial hydraulic manipulator performing fine-motion tasks under the simplified control algorithm are presented. It is shown that performance is significantly improved over traditional control methods. It is also shown that the control scheme is robust to changes in payload...|$|E

40|$|Many {{elderly and}} {{disabled}} people today experience difficulties when manoeuvring an electric wheelchair. In order to help these people, several heuristic navigation algorithms have been devised in the past. However, {{in order to make}} the chair fast and reactive, the wheelchair’s dimensions, non-holonomic and dynamic constraints are often only approximately taken into account. Consequently, these robotic wheelchairs may and do fail in executing the very same manoeuvres with which the {{elderly and disabled}} have problems. A possible approach to tackle this problem, is to use a <b>fine</b> <b>motion</b> planner that takes the kinematic and dynamic constraints explicitly into account.

40|$|Many {{manufacturing}} assembly tasks require <b>fine</b> compliant <b>motion</b> and fast, accurate positioning. Conventional robots perform poorly in these tasks {{because of their}} large mass, friction and backlash in gears, cogging in drive motors and other deleterious effects. Even robots equipped with special control systems enabling compliant operation offer only partial solutions. It is difficult or impossible to automate many product assemblies requiring <b>fine,</b> compliant <b>motion.</b> This problem can be greatly alleviated by dividing the manipulation system into coarse and fine domains. In this scenario, a standard industrial robot {{can serve as a}} coarse positioner which in turn carries a six degrees of freedom <b>fine</b> <b>motion</b> wrist. Thus the robot can access a workspace measured in meters at low bandwidth and low resolution while the wrist can move over millimeters at high bandwidth and high resolution during the final phase of the assembly operation. Work indicates that <b>fine</b> <b>motion</b> wrists using Lorentz levitation can greatly augment the accuracy and dexterity of robots because they are frictionless, have high bandwidths and have a single back drivable moving part. Also, since there is no contact between the moving and stationary parts, wear and contamination can be eliminated. The use of six Lorentz force actuators in combination with real time position and orientation sensing offers several important advantages over magnetic bearing approaches...|$|R

Here we describe recent developments in the SFA technique, specifically the SFA 2000, its simplicity of operation and its extension into new areas of measurement of both static and dynamic forces as well as both normal and lateral (shear and friction) forces.

40|$|The {{flexibility}} of the robot {{is the key to}} its success as a viable aid to production. Flexibility of a robot can be explained in two directions. The first is to increase the physical generality of the robot such that it can be easily reconfigured to handle a wide variety of tasks. The second direction is to increase the ability of the robot to interact with its environment such that tasks can still be successfully completed in the presence of uncertainties. The use of articulated hands are capable of adapting {{to a wide variety of}} grasp shapes, hence reducing the need for special tooling. The availability of low mass, high bandwidth points close to the manipulated object also offers significant improvements I the control of <b>fine</b> <b>motions.</b> This thesis provides a framework for using articulated hands to perform local manipulation of objects.

40|$|Pneumatic {{cylinders}} {{and systems}} {{have dominated the}} majority of industrial plants as two-position actuators due to that they are light-weight, clean, non-flammable; available {{in a wide range}} of sizes, have high cycle rates, can be installed with ease and have payload-to-weight ratios much higher than their other actuator counterparts. These advantages encouraged researchers to develop the performance of pneumatic cylinders and encompass mid-position control to broaden their applications for robotic manipulation. This thesis introduces a novel design, construction, control and analysis of a pneumatically driven reconfigurable modular manipulator system (PRMMS). The focus lies on a hypothesis of encompassing a hybrid electro-pneumatic manipulator while providing a low cost, lightweight, modular and reconfigurable system that can be of great assistant to small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs). The proposed system is mainly pneumatic actuated, for gross movements, with an electrical wrist that should compensate for errors and provide <b>fine</b> <b>motions</b> at the manipulator end effector. This thesis is only involved with the pneumatic actuated modules as part of this hybrid electro-pneumatic proposed system. A general review on modular systems did not encompass pneumatic actuated modular systems. Therefore, an exploration of the validity of pneumatic actuation in these modular systems and a proposed fuzzy logic PD + I controller was set for a passive damped pneumatic system capable of controlling and tracking the movement of a pneumatic cylinder to repeated accuracy of less than ± 0. 1 mm with small displacement capabilities of the same order. Furthermore, a general simulation based methodology for robotic systems is studied. This methodology is based on an iterative process of system modifications leading to improved successful designs of robotic systems. Performance tuning criteria for the system was made possible through experimentations and modifications of the controller and the examination of different valves and cylinder combinations, all within the simulator. In addition, a combined Cartesian-joint control algorithm using low cost microcontrollers was established. Each joint module is controlled via an integrated local microcontroller while a global task controller computes and sets the path motions and control requirements to the modules through communication processes. Further benefiting from the properties of pneumatic cylinders, a proposed compliance control algorithm is applied to achieve safe interactions with humans at the work place by disabling modules which exceed a predefined amount of compliance. This issue of disabled modules opened an investigation for fault tolerance in redundant manipulators for assuring the completion of a task in structured and unstructured environments...|$|E
40|$|Background: Low {{back pain}} (LBP) is a {{one of the}} most common {{symptoms}} of vertebral column diseases. Spinal muscles have a outstanding role in maintaining vertebral column function in daily life. But proper function and motion of hip and knee joints also has an important role in performing smooth, fine and nonstressed movements of lumbar spin. Where as accurate and <b>fine</b> <b>motions</b> of hip and knee joints in cooperate with lumbar spin can improve translation and summation of forces and increase performance of movements. The aim of this research is to indicate the amount of interventions of lower limb joints on lumbar spin function in patients with LBP, and attention to physical treatment (PT) of them. Materials and Methods: Fifty females with LBP due to osteoarthritis (OA) of lumbar spin participated in this study and divided in two groups randomly with similar number of cases: a) ordinary treatment or control group and b) complementary treatment group. Patients in control group treated by routine PT approach (superficial heat, ultrasound, TENS, forward flexion and back extension exercises) and patients in complementary or test group received routine treatment similar to control group and also strength and stretching exercises of hip and knee joint muscles (latisimous dorsi, gluteous maximus, iliopsoas, quadriceps and hamstring) bilaterally. Range of motion (ROM) of lumbar, hip and keen joints by valid goniametere and pain of lumbar in motions at all of axis by visual analog scale measured before, after five and ten sessions of treatments in both groups. Results: In control group with non parametric tests there was not significant difference of MMT of muscles and ROMs of hip and knee joints. Lumbar pain in motion after ten sessions of PT in this group reduced significantly (P< 0. 05). Increase of lumbar motion in all of axis after PT was significant at this patients (P< 0. 05). In second group that received complementary treatments; ROM of joints, lumbar pain had significant differences between onset of treatments and five and ten sessions later (P< 0. 05), but there was not significant findings in MMT of muscles. There were significant differences between percentages of reduce of pain and increase of ROM in comparison of two groups (P< 0. 05). Where as patients that received ordinary PT and strength and stretching of muscles around of hip and knee indicated better recovery signs. Conclusion: Reduce of lumbar pain with improve of motion and flexibility of muscles such as quadriceps, hamstring, gluteus maximus, iliopsoas and latisimous dorsi in a complete physical therapy approach indicate there are a great correlation between lumbar pain and functionality of lower limb joints.
