5|$|Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, {{are created}} by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is {{responsible}} <b>for</b> <b>creating</b> valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force {{over the last few}} million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible <b>for</b> <b>creating</b> domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and inset arches like Royal Arches.|$|E
