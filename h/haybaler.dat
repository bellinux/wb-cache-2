50|$|The schools {{athletics}} {{teams are}} {{known by the}} school's mascot, the <b>Haybaler,</b> or more commonly the 'Balers. The school's colors are red, white, and black. It is common for teams {{to be referred to}} as either the San Benito 'Balers or Hollister 'Balers, and both are considered acceptable. The team competes in 13 sports in the Monterey Bay League as part of the Central Coast Section.|$|E
50|$|The Electrall {{system was}} {{introduced}} in 1954; it was a short-lived attempt to market electrically operated farm equipment and accessories. The system, co-developed with General Electric, consisted of a 208V three-phase alternating-current generator connected with electric cables to the device to be powered. The generator could even power a household. A 10 kW Electrall generator was an option on the Farmall 400 tractor, and a 12.5 kW PTO-driven version was made. The possible applications of Electrall power were many, but few made it to market. IH marketing materials showed a <b>haybaler</b> being Electrall powered. One of the more novel applications of the Electrall was a device to electrocute insects in the field at night (basically like a modern-day bug zapper, but on a larger scale).|$|E
5000|$|Daniel Barone after {{retiring}} in 2009 {{returned to his}} hometown. Here he opened up a shop called Barone Baseball, where him and his buddy Kalev taught hitting and pitching lessons {{for a variety of}} different age groups. Along with this he helped the local highschool baseball team the Hollister <b>Haybalers.</b> With him calling pitches and coaching the pitchers the <b>Haybalers</b> made it to the Central Coast Championship game. Though leaving the team after the 2012 season he still allowed all of the players he coached to throw bullpens and hit at his facility free of charge. On top allowing his former players to use his facilities for free he also was generous enough to give many of his players jobs at his shop cleaning, catching bullpens, and everything in between. Due to the talent Barone saw and developed while working in Hollister at his baseball facility he decided to start competitive travel baseball teams in many different age groups. These age groups ranged from 16-18 and under, 12 and under, and 10 and under. All of these travel ball teams that Barone coached either directly or had a part in helping were very successful. The best team in his program being the 16 and under team who finished a very impressive 23-4. During the time Daniel was back home he was constantly training hoping he cold make a come back in the league. He was weight lifting and doing bands, along with doing his rice bucket workouts to keep his arm in pitching shape. During his time he would also throw bullpens consistently, including throwing live at bats to some of the local high school players, striking them out at will. In 2014 his arm finally felt ready and he tried to make a return to the game of baseball. He joined a team in the independent league in Montana. There he was dominating and things were looking like {{he had a chance to}} get back to the league. Sadly he hurt his arm once again and returned to his hometown of Hollister where he lives with his family.1 ...|$|R
50|$|For {{production}} agriculture, {{past and}} present, two-wheel tractors accept {{a wide range}} of implements, such as the following: For soil-working: rototillers, moldboard plows, disc-plows, rotary plows, root/tuber harvesting plows, small subsoiler plows, powered and non-powered harrows, seeders, transplanters, and planters. Even zero till/no-till planters and seeders have become available. In plant protection and weed control, two-wheel tractor implements consist of various inter-cultivators and sprayers. For harvesting, available implements are: Forage: Sickle bar mowers, disk mowers, hayrakes, hay tedders, <b>haybalers</b> and bale wrappers silage production. For grain harvest: reaper/grain harvesters, reaper-binders, and even combine harvesters are available typically only for Asian two-wheel tractors. For transport, trailers with capacities from 0.5 to 5 plus ton cargoes are available. General mowing implements consist of lawn mowers, brush mowers, and flail mowers. For snow removal, implements consist of snowblowers, power sweepers, and snow/dozer blades. Other implements include: chipper/shredders, log splitters, electrical generator, pressure washer, crimper-roller, fertilizer/salt/lime spreader, and stump grinder. This list of implements (which may not be complete) means that two-wheel tractors can execute practically all of the chores done by larger 4-wheel tractors, with the exception of items like front-loaders, which obviously have the physical stability requirements of a 4-wheel (two-axle) tractor.|$|R
