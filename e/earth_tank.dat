Daniel Martin of The Guardian opines that her characterisation in the serial [...] "shows just how far she's come", whilst Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times feels that she is a [...] "soulful leather-jacketed action heroine". Myles states that Gwen becomes a harsher character, but she feels that, [...] "if she wasn't, people would die". David Cornelius observes that Gwen is no longer the kind-hearted outsider she was when she first joined Torchwood. By Children of Earth she has become [...] "colder and much more aggressive". Her horrific experiences turn her into [...] "a biting cynic"; when both government and army betray the British people, Gwen claims to understand finally why the Doctor does not save humanity from world crises. She believes he [...] "must look at this planet and turn away in shame". A press release stated that Miracle Day had Gwen [...] "make the most terrible decisions, on behalf of all mankind".

40|$|The main {{constraint}} of {{the culture}} of the African catfish Heterobranchus longfilis remains the high mortality rate due mainly to cannibalism. Heterobranchus longifilis is generally cultured in <b>earth</b> ponds, <b>tanks</b> and enclosures. Floating cage aquaculture can be an alternative system to these traditional techniques as it may allow predation control. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to test the effects of floating cages (I m 3) on survival and growth parameters of H. longfilis at different stocking densities in man-made Lake Ayame. In a first experiment which started with fish of 0. 8 +/- 0. 1 g initial mean weight, five stocking densities (50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 fish/m(3)) were tested during a 90 -day experiment. The results showed that unlike final mean weight (WO and mean daily weight gain (Mdwg), weight variation coefficient (final Cv), cannibalism (Cr), mortality (Mr) and survival (Sr) were density dependent: best results of survival, cannibalism and mortality (68. 0 +/- 1. 5 %, 18. 0 +/- 2. 2 % and 14. 0 +/- 1. 5 % respectively) were recorded at the lowest density (50 fish/m(3)). In a second experiment that began with fish of 13. 4 +/- 0. 5 g (Wi) and lasted for 270 days, the stocking densities tested were 6, 12, 25, 50 and 100 fish/m(3). Results of this experiment showed that all the parameters [Mr, Cr, Sr, final Cv and apparent feed conversion ratio (Afcr) ] were influenced by the stocking densities. Higher Wf, Mdwg and Sr and lower final Cv, Cr, Mr, and Afcr were recorded at the lowest stocking densities (6 and 12 fish/m(3)). Cage culture of H. longifilis results in a higher Sr, but a lower Mdwg compared to those usually recorded in traditional rearing systems. However, this low production potential of H. longifilis could be increased by the improvement of rearing conditions (feeding systems, culture management) as noted in other species.

40|$|The fire hazards {{attributed}} to the spark discharge of the static electricity as an inevitable conseqence by liquidity friction of non-conductive liquid, especially in handling petroleum products, were reported frequently and this tendency of such hazards {{becomes more and more}} increased. In the previous studies the observations and experiments of liquidity friction were introductively reported only about the static electrification of the transformer oil for the convenience. In these reports, though far from perfect, the dlfferencts of the static potential charaterestics on the outside wall of the tank which is insulated from earth and tlowed in by charged non-ccnducting fluids i. e. transformer oil, gasoline or diesel kerosine, were compared experimentally. It is also cleared up theoretically and experimentally that static characteristics of such a charged oil tank insulated are affected on the leakage resistance and the static capacity of the tank and those of such a charged oil <b>tank</b> <b>earthed</b> are influenced by the specific resistance and the dielectric constant of the oil in the tank. It is pointed out, for example, that the gauge equipment and the underground tank of a gasoline stand in present use have the possibilily of the fire hazard by the ignition of a spark discharge under certain adequate circumstance. 近代工業における絶縁性の固体，粉体，液体の生産又は処理中，必然的に発生する静電現象はその生産作業工程に障害を与え，更にその放電火花による引火災害，所謂潜在災害が頻発する傾向にある。特に近時石油系可燃性精製油の量産と普及に伴い，その生産処理及び移動積載の際，かかる潜在災害に起因する火災爆発の可能性を重視すべきである。かつて筆者も便宜上高圧絶縁油についてその帯電現象に関する基礎的実験を試みていたが，たまたま昨年 5 月福井県勝山市某ガソリンスタンドでタンク車より地下タンクに給油中，静電気の放電火花による引火と推定された火災があり，また米国New JerseyのStandard Oil Comapnyでも近時過去 10 年間に静電気に起因する災害が 18 件も惹起したとの報告によっても，吾が国においては小被害を加えると相当の被害件数があるものと推定される。従って本稿は絶縁性の石油系精製油中，主要な高圧絶縁油，軽油，ガソリンについて，その受器タンクによって静電気の発生状態の基礎的実験経過とこれに関連する基礎的考察を記載する...|$|R

The GAAT are located in the main plant area of ORNL in the North and South Tank Farms. These tanks were constructed in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project during World War II. Each tank in the South Tank Farm (STF) has a 50 -ft inside diameter and a capacity of {approx} 170, 000 gal. Each Gunite tank in the North Tank Farm (NTF) has a 25 -ft inside diameter with a capacity of {approx} 44, 000 gal. The GAAT were designed to receive radioactive and chemical wastes from ORNL processes. The tanks were constructed of Gunite, which is created by pneumatically spraying concrete over a wire mesh. Following construction, the site was backfilled so the domes of the tanks were covered with {approx} 6 ft of <b>earth.</b> The STF <b>tanks</b> (W- 5, - 6, - 7, - 8, - 9, and - 10) are set in a 2 x 3 array with an east-west axis.

5000|$|In {{his past}} {{career as an}} archaeologist, Blackthorne Shore {{stumbled}} upon many uncanny artifacts which set him on the path that would come to govern his life — a quest for power {{and control of the}} Inhumanoids. In younger years, his search in the jungles of Borneo for an Inhumanoid temple cost him an eye — lost to a native's blowpipe dart — and he returned to America, where he and his sister, Sandra, ran their family's corporation, the Shore Foundation. His dark obsession was renewed with Earth Corps' discovery of an Inhumanoid monster entombed in amber: Blackthorne soon traces ancient documents in his possession to locate Tendril, who in turn liberates D'Compose. Blackthorne then instructs the crooked Senator Masterson to eliminate Earth Corps' funding and turn over the blueprints for their technology, using that knowledge to construct a suit of magnetic armour. He shadows Earth Corps into the subterranean depths, where he targets his armour's power against Metlar, vying to leash the savage Inhumanoid with magnetic force to make him obey his command. His vain pretensions are quashed by Magnokor, and Blackthorne's end seems imminent until he entices Metlar's interest with information about nuclear weapons, which the Inhumanoids then act on. Thankfully, Earth Corps is able to defuse the missiles and halt Metlar's plan, bringing Blackthorne into custody. Blackthorne is sentenced to five years in a maximum security prison, sharing a cell with criminal scientist Dr. Herman Manglar. However, the intelligent computer, Cypheroid, having allied itself with the Inhumanoids, soon arranges Blackthorne's escape. Donning a redesigned magnetic suit, Blackthorne once more foolishly gambles to control Metlar, scarcely managing to slip away when the furious Inhumanoid turns on him. In later dealings, Blackthorne salvages the remains of Dr. Manglar to create a ghastly accomplice in Nightcrawler, adopts the guise of [...] "Brother Druid" [...] to gather an underground cult for D'Compose's servicing, and after evading further prosecution because of a favor from Masterson, is able to release two more Inhumanoids — Gagoyle and Sslither. Blackthorne then schemes with the Inhumanoids during the presidential race, endeavoring to ensure Senator Masterson's victory for his own power-hungry purposes. When the unravelled plan incites Auger's kidnapping and a final terrible battle between Earth and the Inhumanoids, Blackthorne lies in waiting {{to take advantage of the}} closing calamity: just as Magnokor captures Metlar in his magnetic hold once again, Blackthorne turns his armour on the three of them, taking control of their movements and pitting them all against Earth Corps. Before any real damage can be done, however, <b>Earth</b> Corps ally <b>Tank</b> takes the villain by surprise from behind and forces him to desist. Though Auger is rescued, both the Inhumanoids and Blackthorne remain at large.|$|R
50|$|The present Dakor {{owes its}} raison d'etre not to Dank Rishi but to Bodana, a great devotee of Lord Krishna. In his {{previous}} birth, {{he is supposed}} to have lived in Gokul and been a cowherd called Vijayanand. On one 'Holy' day, all the cowherds except Vijyanand worshipped Lord Krishna. His wife too worshipped Lord Krishna. But Vijayanand was proud and stayed at home. Lord Krishna came to his house in disguise of his friend and sent him to perform 'Holi' puja. Coming back, he realised that his friend was none else but Lord Krishna. Next day they fought a battle of colour. Lord Krishna lost and fell into the river. Vijyanand went after him where Lord Krishna revealed his true self. Vijyanand begged forgiveness. Lord Krishna took pity on him and solaced him with a boon that he would be born in Gujarat again in Kaliyug after 4200 years as Vijayanand Bodana in the house of a Krishatriya and his present wife Sudha would again be his wife, called Gangabai, when he will give them a glimpse (darshna) and relieve them by offering them emancipation (Moksha). So as the legend would have it, 'Vijayanand Bodana', a rajput of Dakor, becomes a staunch devotee of Lord Krishna. He used to let the basil plant (Tulsi) grow in an earthen pot with him on his palm and used to go every six months to Dwarika to worship Lord Krishna with the said Tulsi leaves. He did this continuously, unfailingly and untiringly till he was 72 years he then began to find it increasingly difficult to pursue this ritual. Seeing his plight, Lord Krishna told him that on his ensuing visit to Dwarika, he should bring a bullock-cart with him and Lord Krishna would accompany him to Dakor as he was exceedingly pleased with his devotion. Accordingly, Bodana went with bullock-cart to Dwarika. The hereditary priests of Dwarika (Gugli Brahmins) asked him as to why he had brought a cart with him. Whereupon, Bodana replied that he had done so to take away Lord Krishna. Looking to the ramshackle cart, they did not believe him but nevertheless locked and sealed the sanctum sanctorum of Dwarika Temple for the night. At midnight, Lord Krishna broke open all the doors, awoke Bodana and told him to take him to Dakor. Shortly afterwards, Lord Krishna called upon Bodana to rest in the bullock-cart and drove the cart himself till reached the vicinity of Dakor. Here (near Bileshwar Mahadev on Dakor-Nadiad road) they rested for some time, touching and holding a branch of neem tree. He woke up Bodana and asked him to take over. Since that day, this neem tree is found to have one sweet branch though the rest of the branches are bitter and it forms the subject of a well-known Gujarati song (bhajan). In Dwarika, the Gugli Brahmins finding the image missing chased Bodana and came to Dakor in pursuit. Bodana was frightened but Lord Krishna told him to hide the idol of the deity in the Gomti tank and meet the Guglis. Accordingly, Bodana hid the idol and went to meet the Guglis with a pot of curd to pacify them. They became angry and one of them threw a spear at him. He fell down dead While hurting Bodana with a spear it also hurt the image of the deity hidden in Gomti tank and the water turned red with Lord Krishna's (Ranchhodraiji's) blood. It is said that even today the <b>earth</b> of Gomti <b>tank</b> where the image lay is red while rest of the tank is of brown mud. In the midst of Gomti tank, over the place where Lord Krishna was hidden, a small temple having the Lord's foot-prints is constructed and this temple is linked with the bank of Gomti Tank by a bridge. Even with the death of Bodana, the Guglis were not appeased. Requesting Lord Krishna to return to Dwarika, they sat on the bank of Gomti tank and went on a hunger strike. At last, Lord Ranchhodraiji (Krishna) directed Gangabai, wife of Bodana, to give gold equivalent of his weight and ask the Guglis to return to Dwarika. Poor lady, the widow of Bodana, was a pauper and could not afford to do so. By a miracle, the idol became as light as a golden nose-ring (1, 1/4 val i.e.1/2 gram in weight) which was all that the widow of Bodana Gangabai had. The Guglis were disappointed but the Lord mercifully directed that they would find after six months an exact replica of the idol in Sevaradhan Vav (well with steps) at Dwarika. The impatient Guglis looked for the idol sometime earlier than they were told and as a result, found an idol which, though similar to the original one, was smaller, Pilgrims to Dakor still visit the places stated to have been associated with the legend viz. Where the branch of neem tree under which Lord rested while coming to Dankpur subsequently turned sweet; where the idol was hidden in the Gomti tank; whereon the balance was set up to weigh the original idol which Bodana had enshrined.|$|R
