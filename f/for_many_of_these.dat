5|$|Carbon is {{essential}} to all known living systems, and without it {{life as we know}} it could not exist (see alternative biochemistry). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and crude oil (petroleum). Crude oil is distilled in refineries by the petrochemical industry to produce gasoline, kerosene, and other products. Cellulose is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood, cotton, linen, and hemp. Cellulose is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool, cashmere and silk. Plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> synthetic substances come from crude oil.|$|E
5|$|In {{a partial}} {{reaction}} against the Manzoni years, Birmingham City Council is demolishing {{some of the}} brutalist buildings like the Central Library and has an extensive tower block demolition and renovation programme. There has been much redevelopment in the city centre in recent years, including the award-winning Future Systems' Selfridges building in the Bullring Shopping Centre, the Brindleyplace regeneration project, the Millennium Point science and technology centre, and the refurbishment of the iconic Rotunda building. Funding <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> projects {{has come from the}} European Union; the Town Hall for example received £3million in funding from the European Regional Development Fund.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural factors, much has been done intentionally to make the skies at the park clear and dark and help keep them that way. Within the park, former overhead electrical lines have been buried so they do not obstruct views, all lighting is shielded, and all white lights have been converted to red, which has the least effect on night vision and astrophotography. Light from passing vehicles is blocked by earthen berms covered with grass, or shrubbery and spruce trees; the Astronomy Field gate has a special light-blocking tarp. The park's Dark Sky Fund has paid <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> improvements since 1999.|$|E
5|$|Polar bears can be {{hunted for}} sport in Canada {{with a special}} permit and accompaniment by a local guide. This can be an {{important}} source of income for small communities, as guided hunts bring in more income than selling the polar bear hide on markets. The United States, Russia, Norway, Greenland, and Canada allow subsistence hunting, and Canada distributes hunting permits to indigenous communities. The selling of these permits is a main source of income <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> communities. Their hides can be used for subsistence purposes, kept as hunting trophies, or can be bought in markets.|$|E
5|$|Second class' {{passengers}} were leisure tourists, academics, {{members of the}} clergy and middle class English and American families. The ship's musicians travelled in second class accommodations; they were not counted {{as members of the}} crew but were employed by an agency under contract to the White Star Line. The average ticket price for an adult second class passenger was £13, the equivalent of £ today. and <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> passengers, their travel experience on the Titanic was akin to travelling first class on smaller liners. Second class passengers had their own library and the men had access to a private smoking room. Second class children could read the children's books provided in the library or play deck quoits and shuffleboard on the second class promenade. Twelve-year-old Ruth Becker passed the time by pushing her two-year-old brother Richard around the enclosed promenade in a stroller provided by the White Star Line.|$|E

50|$|Short games {{consist of}} 1 session of setup, 2-3 {{sessions}} of game-play, and one session <b>for</b> debriefing. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> games {{are designed to}} replace a single textbook chapter and typically span a week of class.|$|R
5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{effects of}} Planet Nine would explain five {{aspects of the}} Solar System: the clustering of the orbits of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (eTNOs); the high perihelia of objects like Sedna that are detached from Neptune's influence; the high inclinations of eTNOs with orbits roughly perpendicular to {{the plane of the}} Solar System, high inclination Kuiper belt objects with semi-major axis less than 100 AU, and the obliquity, or tilt, of the Sun's axis relative to the plane of the Solar System. While other mechanisms have been offered <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> peculiarities the gravitational influence of Planet Nine {{is the only one that}} explains all five. The dynamical effects of Planet Nine also excite the inclinations of scattering objects, which in numerical simulations leaves the inclination distribution of short-period comets with a broader distribution than is observed.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} HD, but there are {{treatments}} available to reduce the severity {{of some of its}} symptoms. <b>For</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> treatments, evidence to confirm their effectiveness in treating symptoms of HD specifically are incomplete. As the disease progresses the ability to care for oneself declines, and carefully managed multidisciplinary caregiving becomes increasingly necessary. Although there have been relatively few studies of exercises and therapies that help rehabilitate cognitive symptoms of HD, there is some evidence for the usefulness of physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. An association between caffeine intake and earlier age of onset in Huntington's disease has been found but, since this finding was based on retrospective questionnaire data rather than a blinded, randomized trial or case-control study, this work is a poor basis for guiding lifestyle decisions.|$|E

25|$|Classical MHC {{molecules}} present epitopes to the TCRs of CD8+ T lymphocytes.
