5|$|Since 1953, the National Intercollegiate Band {{has been}} the {{resident}} ensemble of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma's Commissioning Program, which has added thirty new works to the band repertoire since its inception and is the longest-running commissioning program <b>for</b> <b>wind</b> band music in the United States.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 study {{released}} by the U.S. Department of Energy noted that the capacity factor of new wind installations was increasing as the technology improves, and projected further improvements for future capacity factors. In 2010, the department estimated the capacity factor of new wind turbines in 2010 to be 45%. The annual average capacity factor <b>for</b> <b>wind</b> generation in the US has varied between 29.8% and 34.0% during the period 2010–2015.|$|E

5|$|Aalborg is North Jutland's major {{industrial}} and commercial centre, exporting grain, cement, and spirits. Heavy industry {{was behind the}} city's prosperity until fairly recently. Many of the factories have now closed, {{to be replaced by}} developments in the knowledge-based and green-energy sectors. Mobile and wireless communications industries have grown substantially since the 1990s, as has rotor production <b>for</b> <b>wind</b> turbines.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Kappa Kappa Psi Grand President Hugh McMillen {{began the}} Commissioning Program to add new {{music to the}} band repertoire, {{beginning}} with a $500 commission of Don Gillis, who provided Ballet for Band for the NIB. The Commissioning Program is now the longest-running commissioning program <b>for</b> <b>wind</b> band music in American history, and has produced works that have secured {{a place in the}} emerging band canon and have garnered critical acclaim, such as Robert Russell Bennett's Symphonic Songs for Band and Karel Husa's Concerto for Trumpet and Wind Orchestra.|$|E
5|$|Induction generators, {{which were}} often used <b>for</b> <b>wind</b> power {{projects}} in the 1980s and 1990s, require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction. Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.|$|E

5|$|Neodymium–iron–boron magnets {{can have}} up to 6% of the {{neodymium}} substituted by dysprosium to raise the coercivity for demanding applications, such as drive motors for electric vehicles and generators <b>for</b> <b>wind</b> turbines. This substitution would require up to 100grams of dysprosium per electric car produced. Based on Toyota's projected 2million units per year, the use of dysprosium in applications such as this would quickly exhaust its available supply. The dysprosium substitution may also be useful in other applications because it improves the corrosion resistance of the magnets.|$|E
5|$|South Australia has {{provided}} regulatory certainty <b>for</b> <b>wind</b> farms, {{and the government}} has implemented land use planning policies which represent national best practice for accommodating wind farms. On 2 June 2009, Premier Mike Rann announced plans to increase South Australia's renewable energy production target to 33% by 2020, well above the national target of 20% by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Telenor Denmark, {{part of the}} Norwegian Telenor {{telecommunications}} and mobile phone company, has a workforce of about 1,100 in Aalborg, {{making it one of}} the city's largest new employers. Siemens Wind Power has rotor-blade production and testing facilities in Aaborg. In 2012 and 2013, there were additions in both areas. The new testing plant is the world's largest research test centre <b>for</b> <b>wind</b> turbine technology. In 2012, the company shipped a record 570 wind turbine blades from the Port of Aalborg, mainly to England and Ireland, up 45% on the previous year.|$|E

5|$|The Hurricane Severity Index (HSI) {{is another}} scale used and rates the {{severity}} {{of all types of}} tropical and subtropical cyclones based on both the intensity and the size of their wind fields. The HSI is a 0 to 50 point scale, allotting up to 25 points for a tropical cyclone's intensity and up to 25 points <b>for</b> <b>wind</b> field size. Points are awarded on a sliding scale, with the majority of points reserved for hurricane force and greater wind fields.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} birds to {{navigate}} during migrations cannot be fully explained by endogenous programming, {{even with the}} help of responses to environmental cues. The ability to successfully perform long-distance migrations can probably only be fully explained with an accounting for the cognitive ability of the birds to recognize habitats and form mental maps. Satellite tracking of day migrating raptors such as ospreys and honey buzzards has shown that older individuals are better at making corrections <b>for</b> <b>wind</b> drift.|$|E
5|$|The first {{advisories}} {{were issued}} by the Canadian Hurricane Centre on September26, although at that time they broadly suggested the possibility existed <b>for</b> <b>wind</b> and rain across Atlantic Canada. As Juan approached on September27, warning broadcasts on local media in Atlantic Canada were changed accordingly. The public and emergency officials in the expected landfall area were told to make preparations for a potential disaster, after the CHC bulletins indicated the possibility existed for significant wind damage and flooding from both heavy rain and storm surges, as well as power outages.|$|E

5|$|Wind power {{capacity}} has expanded rapidly to 336 GW in June 2014, and {{wind energy production}} was around 4% of total worldwide electric power usage, and growing rapidly. The actual amount of electric power that wind is able to generate is calculated by multiplying the nameplate capacity by the capacity factor, which varies according to equipment and location. Estimates of the capacity factors <b>for</b> <b>wind</b> installations {{are in the range}} of 35% to 44%.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the wind}} power {{industry}} {{was affected by}} the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010, GWEC predicts that the installed capacity of wind power will be 792.1 GW {{by the end of}} 2020 and 4,042 GW by end of 2050. The increased commissioning of wind power is being accompanied by record low prices for forthcoming renewable electric power. In some cases, wind onshore is already the cheapest electric power generation option and costs are continuing to decline. The contracted prices <b>for</b> <b>wind</b> onshore {{for the next few years}} are now as low as 30 USD/MWh.|$|E
5|$|Baggio has {{featured}} in two Italian commercials which reference his infamous penalty miss in the 1994 World Cup final.

The second, made for Johnnie Walker in 2001, showed how he managed to conquer his grief from the miss by believing in himself and scoring the equalising penalty against Chile in the 1998 World Cup. He has {{featured in}} several Diadora commercials, as he endorsed their products. In July 2017, Diadora teamed up with Baggio once again to launch the new Signature Match Winner RB Capsule Collection.|$|E
