500|$|An {{analysis}} of the time difference between the transmission of the ping and the aircraft's response allowed Inmarsat to determine the aircraft's distance from the satellite. This resulted in two arcs—referred to as the [...] "northern corridor" [...] and [...] "southern corridor"—where the aircraft may have been located {{at the time of}} its last complete handshake at 08:11. Using an [...] "innovative technique" [...] that has [...] "never before [...] used in an investigation of this sort", the team determined it could also use the burst frequency offset to determine the aircraft's speed and position along the identified arcs. Inmarsat cross-checked its methodology to known flight data from six Boeing777 aircraft flying in various directions on the same day, and <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> match. Applying the technique to the handshake signals from Flight370 gave results that correlated strongly with the expected and actual measurements of a southern trajectory over the Indian Ocean, but poorly with a northern trajectory. Further revised calculations to account for movements of the satellite relative to the earth allowed the northern corridor to be ruled out completely. This analysis was passed on to Malaysian authorities on 23March.|$|E

The division duly turned north-east with the 1st Light Horse Brigade entering Isdud close to the Mediterranean Sea. On the right, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade captured the villages of Suafir el Sharkiye and Arak Suweidan, a convoy and its escort (some 350 prisoners). While the brigade was reorganising, Ottoman guns further north opened fire, shelling both captors and captives alike. Just before dark the 2nd Light Horse Brigade captured a further 200 prisoners.

2500|$|Oystercatcher mussel feeding {{provides}} an example of how the optimal diet model can be utilized. [...] Oystercatchers forage on mussels and crack them open with their bills. The constraints on these birds are the characteristics of the different mussel sizes. While large mussels provide more energy than small mussels, large mussels are harder to crack open due to their thicker shells. This means that while large mussels have a higher energy content (E), they also have a longer handling time (h). The profitability of any mussel is calculated as E/h. [...] The oystercatchers must decide which mussel size will provide enough nutrition to outweigh the cost and energy required to open it. In their study, Meire and Ervynck tried to model this decision by graphing the relative profitabilities of different sized mussels. They came up with a bell-shaped curve, indicating that moderately sized mussels were the most profitable. However, they observed that if an oystercatcher rejected too many small mussels, the time it took to search for the next suitable mussel greatly increased. This observation shifted their bell-curve to the right (Figure 4). [...] However, while this model predicted that oystercatchers should prefer mussels of 50–55mm, the observed data showed that oystercatchers actually prefer mussels of 30–45mm. Meire and Ervynk then realized the preference of mussel size did not only depend on the profitability of the prey, but also on the prey density. After this was accounted for, they <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> agreement between the model's prediction and the observed data.|$|E
