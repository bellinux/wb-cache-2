As a porous material, <b>foam</b> <b>concrete</b> can be {{manufactured}} not only into building materials with good heat insulation performance, but also into materials with good water permeability, and by properly controlling {{the size and}} shape of the pores, the <b>foam</b> <b>concrete</b> can be used as acoustic material to meet People's increasing demand for functional materials. Therefore, the development of <b>foam</b> <b>concrete</b> has a vast potential for future market. Though the setting time of <b>foam</b> <b>concrete</b> is one of the key technical parameters for the preparation of high performance <b>foam</b> <b>concrete,</b> there is no standard method for the testing of the <b>foam</b> <b>concrete’s</b> setting time.

A detailed study concerning the composition, physical properties and production of <b>foamed</b> <b>concrete</b> was first carried out in the 1950s and 60s. Following this research, new admixtures were developed in the late 1970s and early 80s, which led to the commercial use of <b>foamed</b> <b>concrete</b> in construction projects.

50|$|<b>Foamed</b> <b>concrete</b> can be {{produced}} with dry densities of 400 to 1600 kg/m³, with 7-day strengths of approximately 1 to 10 N/mm² respectively.

3000|$|Meanwhile, <b>foam</b> <b>concrete</b> {{has been}} more widely used for {{non-structural}} members in buildings, working as lightweight material for sound barriers, filling for composite members as well as fillers for masonry due to its good thermal insulation and ability to protect against fires (Mydin and Wang 2011). Although <b>foam</b> <b>concrete</b> has been widely used for non-structural purposes, there is an increasing trend for its use in structural support (Mohamad et al. 2014). The compression and flexural resistance of <b>foam</b> <b>concrete</b> have been studied to determine the structural capacity of <b>foam</b> <b>concrete</b> members (Ibrahim et al. 2014). Due to its inherent low density and low strength (Thakrele 2014; Yue and [...] Bing 2015), <b>foam</b> <b>concrete</b> is often used with steel reinforcements or steel composites (Hilal et al. 2015; Ikponmwosa et al. 2014; Lim et al. 2014; Tan et al. 2015).

50|$|<b>Foamed</b> <b>concrete</b> mixture may be poured or {{pumped into}} moulds, or {{directly}} into structural elements. The foam enables the slurry to flow freely {{due to the}} thixotropic behaviour of the foam bubbles, allowing it to be easily poured into the chosen form or mould. The viscous material requires up to 24 hours to solidify (or as little as two hours if steam cured with temperatures up to 70 °C to accelerate the process.), depending on variables including ambient temperature and humidity. Once solidified, the formed produce may be released from its mould.|$|E
50|$|<b>Foamed</b> <b>concrete</b> {{typically}} {{consists of}} a slurry of cement and fly ash or sand and water, although some suppliers recommend pure cement and water with the foaming agent for very lightweight mixes. This slurry is further mixed with a synthetic aerated foam in a concrete mixing plant. The foam is created using a foaming agent, mixed with water and air from a generator.

There are many methods and compositions that enhance the strength of non-autoclaved <b>foam</b> <b>concretes.</b> The results of activation of raw materials and the foam mixture in electromagnetic devices demonstrate that {{an increase in the}} treatment time of water-cement pastes from 10 to 100 seconds leads to a shift of distribution curves toward a bigger number of small fractions of cement. The authors have discovered that the activation can increase the surface area of solid components of the <b>foam</b> <b>concrete</b> mix by 25 - 30 %, the binding activity - to 35 %, and the reactivity of the filler is also increased. Their interaction involves formation of a more durable material.
