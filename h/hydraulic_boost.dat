The Dart has 10 airbags standard; {{it also has a}} reactive head-restraint system for the front seats, and other available systems are blind-spot monitoring and rear cross path detection. The Giulietta, on which the Dart is based, has achieved the highest rating for a compact car in the EuroNCAP tests.|$|E
50|$|Starting in the 1940s, {{hydraulics}} {{were introduced}} to address these problems. In their early incarnations, hydraulic pumps attached to the engines would feed high-pressure oil through tubes to the various control surfaces. Here, small valves were attached to the original control cables, controlling the flow of oil into an associated actuator connected to the control surface. One of the earliest fittings of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>boost</b> system was to ailerons on late-war models of the P-38L, removing the need for great human strength {{in order to achieve}} a higher rate of roll.|$|E
5000|$|Test {{flights of}} the five prototypes were plagued by crashes caused by {{failures}} of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>boost</b> system and landing gear as well as poor forward visibility (the latter was corrected with fitting of a new slightly [...] "drooped" [...] nose). La-250A made a single test flight in 1956, only 6 flights in 1957, and a mere 14 flights in 1958. Frustrated {{by the lack of}} progress, Soviet Air Force stopped all work on the K-15 system in 1959. Lessons learned with K-15 were used to develop new interceptor system requirements which led to the Tupolev Tu-28 interceptor.|$|E

50|$|Kit flight {{tested the}} X-1A and X-1B, the X-4, the X-5, and also flew the XF-92A.

He {{was the first to}} see the curvature of the earth and the sky dark at mid-day. The X-1A was powered by four rocket motors using liquid oxygen and alcohol as fuel. Looking rather exotic even in photos today, the X-1 used nitrogen tanks to pressurize many of the systems including the fuel tanks, cockpit and the landing gear system. However, the flight controls were completely conventional with strictly mechanical linkage and no <b>hydraulic</b> <b>boost.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The type {{was unable}} to receive FAA {{certification}} to engage in civil activities due to the nonredundant hydraulic flight boost system drive. A redesign of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>boost</b> system drive was incorporated in the succeeding CH-47D, allowing that model to achieve certification as the Boeing Model 234. A total of 233 CH-47Cs was built. Canada bought a total of eight CH-47Cs; deliveries of the type began in 1974. Receiving the Canadian designation [...] "CH-147", these were fitted with a power hoist above the crew door; other changes included a flight engineer station in the rear cabin: Boeing referred to the configuration as the [...] "Super C". The CH-47C was used widely during the Vietnam war, eventually replacing the older H-21 Shawnee in the combat assault support role.|$|E
5000|$|The extended-range C-130E model entered {{service in}} 1962 {{after it was}} {{developed}} as an interim long-range transport for the Military Air Transport Service. Essentially a B-model, the new designation {{was the result of}} the installation of 1,360 US gal (5,150 L) Sargent Fletcher external fuel tanks under each wing's midsection and more powerful Allison T56-A-7A turboprops. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>boost</b> pressure to the ailerons was reduced back to [...] as a consequence of the external tanks' weight in the middle of the wingspan. The E model also featured structural improvements, avionics upgrades and a higher gross weight. Australia took delivery of 12 C130E Hercules during 1966-67 to supplement the 12 C-130A models already in service with the RAAF. Sweden and Spain fly the TP-84T version of the C-130E fitted for aerial refueling capability.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Turbo-prop trainer aircraft are designed to offer a cost effective alternative to military jet training aircraft. As a design objective of such aircraft, the Military Specifications of handling qualities applicable to jet trainer aircraft should be satisfied. However, {{in line with the}} philosophy of low purchase and maintenance costs, the added complexity of a <b>hydraulic</b> power <b>boost</b> system for the control surfaces cannot be accepted. The objective of this work was to optimise the roll control system so as to achieve an optimum of ergonomic design combined with the performance goals of the military specifications, using purely aerodynamic means of balance. Relevant British and American civilian and military specifications and simulator studies have been reviewed to select the detailed design objectives of the study. The American Mil. Specs. were selected as a baseline, with modifications derived from the results of simulator experiments. A Baseline Aircraft was selected on which to apply the optimisation. The highest performance turbo-prop trainer of the time was selected. A mathematical model of the roll response was derived for the extrapolation of flight test data and to allow an evaluation and optimisation of the critical aileron parameters. A description of the model and comparison to flight test results is given in the text. Literature was searched to examine the availability of information for the aerodynamicist to conduct such an optimisation. The results were disappointing, showing that very little work had been conducted on aileron design since the late 1940 's and that the work of that time was not entirely relevant to today's requirements. Because the literature search was not conclusive, further flight tests had to be conducted on the Baseline Aircraft to investigate different forms of aerodynamic balance. The performance of the ailerons and some of the problems encountered in their usage are reported in this thesis and forms a data bank from which to conduct the optimisation. Finally, a selection process is conducted to size the aileron to satisfy the performance goals and to select the best aerodynamic balance to achieve the ergonomic goals. The achieved performance is summarised and compared with the original design goals. It is concluded that the optimised aileron is capable of achieving the design goals over the major portion of the design envelope. The design optimisation process is not limited to turbo-prop aircraft but can be applied to any high performance aircraft with reversible controls...|$|R
40|$|Manado City is growing, its {{population}} is increasing. This demands {{the city to}} grow outside its borders and even into the sea by using land reclamation. Introducing new challenges or making challenges bigger, which are already present. Not only growth {{is present in the}} city, going forward and becoming better and better is an on-going fight for cities. The city came up with a vision “Manado, Model City of Eco Tourism” and a mission “Make Manado a City of Happiness” for their future. Introducing a study on this subject and to anticipate on the city’s goals, the research question is stated as; What are the options to supplement Manado’s vision and mission, making the city more safe and attractive for tourists and citizens? Within this research, two other challenges regarding Manado city will be investigated as well. In the year of 2003 a major flood occurred in the city, causing great damage to the city with many casualties. Nowadays, the risk of flooding is still present. Secondly, a challenge arises at the border of the city. The coastline of Manado suffers from erosion at specific locations, possibly caused by development of the reclaimed land in the past. Narrowing the research, an analysis will be made upon selected subjects. Analysing the coastal protection, river floods and the city’s Vision and Mission gives {{a clear view of the}} current state and what could be expected from the future. The goal is to come to a sound idea of the needs and possibilities related to coastal protection, Kota Manado and its Vision and Mission. Working towards advices, different time paths and desires are noticed. Besides recommendations, which can be adopted at any time, found solutions are divided in short, mid and long term time spans. On short term the rivers and garbage have to be handled and nuisance of either one increases day by day. At many places the river is blocked. Removing these blockages is a good start. In addition, the embankments and beds can be ‘smoothened’, to improve the river’s flow. Besides the river attention on the short term, garbage clogs up the city. Waste Management Control is already improving. Clean ups have to be supported by the government, giving a good example to its citizens. By these measures a start is made to work towards real solutions, coming to an Improved Garbage Service. As mentioned before, improving the Waste Management Control is a continuing process. Besides the short term, this solution has a mid-term basis too. By adaption of the 3 R-principle, garbage will be even less. This principle represents the Reduction, Reuse and Recycle of materials. The amount of waste will reduce and the city will be cleaner, although it will take a while to adopt. Measurements need to be coordinated and monitored. Making so-called Pre-Project-Planning gives benefits to make them successful. This should not only be used in this case, but also for regular Civil Engineering projects. Erosion is another problem Manado City is facing nowadays. However, its effects evolve more slowly and are thereby less noticeable. The coastline of Manado can be divided in three sections. Section one consists of the Southern part of the coastline and the municipality is already undertaking action to stop the erosion. The adopted measures are well designed and thought through. Even on places where there’s little area to construct a protection, the chosen measure could also be used. Section two is located near the boulevard area. Large land reclamations are constructed along the shore. The reclaimed areas are well protected by big stones and do not suffer from any erosion. These large land reclamations, however, do have side effects. One of them is the change in the current, leading to a flow towards the ’Bunaken’ coral reef area. This flow transports a lot of sediment, dust and garbage and killing a lot of fish and coral. So, for future land reclamations, an investigation into these effects must be done if the city really cares about its environment and wants to prevent it from destroying. Section three is situated in the North of Manado. The protection of the northern coastline consists of vegetation and Mangroves. Due to certain changes in the past, among others construction of reclaimed areas, part of the northern shoreline started to erode. The continuing process of erosion can be resolved on a mid-term base. With solutions like, for instance Mangroves, it can stop the erosion and improve the environmental value of the coastline as well, leading to an eco-friendly solution. A sustainable future for the city of Manado is obtained by their vision “Manado Model City for Ecotourism” and mission “To Make Manado City a city of Happiness”. The government cannot do this on its own. Involving and, most important, convincing the local community of the vision and mission will speed up the progression. This combines the short and long term philosophy. On short notice the local community has to be convinced and at the same time, the long term vision and mission can be fulfilled too. Manado City has a great amount of opportunities to fulfil their mission and are they are well available. Even small improvements can make a change. A good example to use the opportunities and to anticipate on the mission and vision of the city is to construct several parks or a beach in the centre of town. A park or a beach can be created to attract not only tourists but also local citizens. For tourists, including divers, it will be a welcoming relaxing spot to comfort their stay in Manado. So in this way it will give the mission and vision of Manado a tremendous <b>boost.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
50|$|The EC145 is {{fitted with}} an all-glass cockpit, {{consists}} of a Thales Avionics MEGHAS Flight Control Display System with active matrix liquid crystal displays (LCDs); it can be piloted by either one or two pilots. A number of systems are independently redundant, including the autopilot system, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>boost,</b> transmission lubrication, {{and some of the}} onboard sensors. The EC145 T2 features additional and newer avionics systems, such as a full 4-axis autopilot and dual-channel Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC); three large LCD primary displays were also introduced to control these systems. The type is fully capable of Category A operations; in November 2008, an EC145 performed the first medical transport flights under instrument flight rules (IFR) in Europe; the type is able to fly entirely under GPS navigation from takeoff to final approach when required. The EC145 is also the first civil helicopter to be fitted with night vision-compatible cockpit instrumentation and lighting straight off the production line.|$|E
5000|$|Building on lessons learned, Lockheed Martin {{modified}} {{a commercial}} {{variant of the}} C-130 into a High Technology Test Bed (HTTB). This test aircraft set numerous short takeoff and landing performance records and significantly expanded the database for future derivatives of the C-130. [...] Modifications made to the HTTB included extended chord ailerons, a long chord rudder, fast-acting double-slotted trailing edge flaps, a high-camber wing leading edge extension, a larger dorsal fin and dorsal fins, the addition of three spoiler panels to each wing upper surface, a long-stroke main and nose landing gear system, and changes to the flight controls and a change from direct mechanical linkages assisted by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>boost,</b> to fully powered controls, in which the mechanical linkages from the flight station controls operated only the hydraulic control valves of the appropriate boost unit. The HTTB first flew on 19 June 1984, with civil registration of N130X. After demonstrating many new technologies, {{some of which were}} applied to the C-130J, the HTTB was lost in a fatal accident on 3 February 1993, at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, in Marietta, Georgia. [...] The crash was attributed to disengagement of the rudder fly-by-wire flight control system, resulting in a total loss of rudder control capability while conducting ground minimum control speed tests (Vmcg). The disengagement was a result of the inadequate design of the rudder's integrated actuator package by its manufacturer; the operator's insufficient system safety review failed to consider the consequences of the inadequate design to all operating regimes. A factor which contributed to the accident was the flight crew's lack of engineering flight test training.|$|E
