5|$|Estimates put {{the average}} energy <b>density</b> of the Universe at the {{equivalent}} of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms).

Unlike the matter and dark matter, the dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{representations of}} non-Gaussian probability <b>densities</b> {{for use in}} various estimation {{problems associated with the}} Bayesian Linear Model. We define a class of <b>densities</b> that we call Strongly Super- Gaussian, and show the relationship of these <b>densities</b> to Gaussian Scale Mixtures, and <b>densities</b> with positive kurtosis. Such <b>densities</b> have been used to model "sparse" random variables, with <b>densities</b> that are sharply peaked with heavy tails. We show that strongly super-Gaussian <b>densities</b> are natural generalizations of Gaussian <b>densities,</b> and permit the derivation of monotonic iterative algorithms for parameter estimation in sparse coding in overcomplete signal dictionaries, blind source separation, independent component analysis, and blind multichannel deconvolution. Mixtures of strongly super- Gaussian <b>densities</b> can be used to model arbitrary <b>densities</b> with greater economy that a Gaussian mixture model. The framework is extended to multivariate dependency models for independent subspace analysis.

Ordinarily the <b>density</b> fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the <b>density.</b> At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of <b>density</b> fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.

40|$|Background: Climate {{change can}} affect the {{activity}} and distribution of species, including pathogens and parasites. The <b>densities</b> and distribution range of the sheep tick (Ixodes ricinus) and it’s transmitted pathogens appears to be increasing. Thus, {{a better understanding of}} questing tick <b>densities</b> in relation to climate and weather conditions is urgently needed. The aim {{of this study was to}} test predictions regarding the temporal pattern of questing tick <b>densities</b> at two different elevations in Norway. We predict that questing tick <b>densities</b> will decrease with increasing elevations and increase with increasing temperatures, but predict that humidity levels will rarely affect ticks in this northern, coastal climate with high humidity. Methods: We described the temporal pattern of questing tick <b>densities</b> at ~ 100 and ~ 400 m a. s. l. along twelve transects in the coastal region of Norway. We used the cloth lure method at 14 -day intervals during the snow-free season to count ticks in two consecutive years in 20 m 2 plots. We linked the temporal pattern of questing tick <b>densities</b> to local measurements of the prevailing weather. Results: The questing tick <b>densities</b> were much higher and the season was longer at ~ 100 compared to at ~ 400 m a. s. l. There was a prominent spring peak in both years and a smaller autumn peak in one year at ~ 100 m a. s. l.; but no marked peak at ~ 400 m a. s. l. Tick <b>densities</b> correlated positively with temperature, from low <b>densities</b> 15 - 17 °C. We found no evidence for reduced questing <b>densities</b> during the driest conditions measured. Conclusions: Tick questing <b>densities</b> differed even locally linked to elevation (on the same hillside, a few kilometers apart). The tick <b>densities</b> were strongly hampered by low temperatures that limited the duration of the questing seasons, whereas the humidity appeared not to be a limiting factor under the humid conditions at our study site. We expect rising global temperatures to increase tick <b>densities</b> and lead to a transition from a short questing season with low <b>densities</b> in the current cold and sub-optimal tick habitats, to longer questing seasons with overall higher <b>densities</b> and a marked spring peak...|$|R
