40|$|Novel <b>gene</b> <b>technologies</b> {{have allowed}} to {{manipulate}} the genetic balance of candidate molecules in mice in a controllable manner. Homologous or site-specific recombination in embryonic stem cells allows to study the consequences of deficiencies, mutations, conditional or tissue specific expression of gene products in transgenic mice. These technological breakthroughs have significantly advanced biomedical research and {{our understanding of the}} pathophysiological role of candidate disease genes. In addition, gene transfer allows to test the possible therapeutic use of gene products for gene therapy. With the advent of genome sequencing programs, these <b>gene</b> <b>technologies</b> provide means to study gene function in a conclusive manner. Furthermore, disease models can be generated which can be used as testmodels for (gene) therapy or for discovery of novel genes using differential gene profiling techniques.

40|$|Despite of {{the immense}} {{potential}} of <b>gene</b> <b>technologies</b> for tree breeding, release of genetic modified trees {{is still very}} rare. Biosafety concerns have hitherto limited application of <b>gene</b> <b>technologies.</b> The potential risks of transgenic trees, in particular transfer of recombinant DNA into the gene pool of a given species via vertical gene transfer, have been motive of concern. Biosafety research may allow avoiding potential risks of this technology. However, the evaluation of strategies for prevention of vertical gene transfer, {{probably the most important}} concern toward transgenic trees, has been hindered by the long time they require to reach the reproductive phase. We tested different strategies for promoting early flowering in poplar, aiming the development of a system for biosafety studies on gene containment. Early flowering poplar containing the 35 S::LFY or HSP::FT gene constructs allowed first approaches for the faster evaluation of gene containment. However, some drawbacks, e. g., disturbed vegetative growth and flower development, still limit their potential application on biosafety research.
