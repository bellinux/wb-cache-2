40|$|Following a brief {{description}} of multi-state insolvency theories and the different types of jurisdiction exercisable by a court, this paper examines jurisdiction in corporate insolvency within Australia. It begins with the constitutional context and then addresses geographical jurisdiction; jurisdiction to prescribe conduct, and jurisdiction <b>to</b> <b>adjudicate</b> between parties. It briefly touches upon the notion of an inherent jurisdiction <b>to</b> <b>adjudicate</b> in liquidation and on jurisdiction for proceedings during the course of, rather than on the adjudication of, a liquidation. The discussion on jurisdiction <b>to</b> <b>adjudicate</b> in a multi-state liquidation in Australia addresses winding up of a foreign company under Part 5. 7 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) as well as topics such as forum non conveniens; lis alibi pendens; anti-suit injunctions; and the notion of discretion to exercise jurisdiction to wind up a company. The jurisdiction to provide aid and auxiliary assistance upon request from a foreign court is also touched upon briefly...|$|R
5000|$|The city of Tacoma began {{purchasing}} {{property in}} Lester in 1963, seeking {{to protect the}} Green River watershed where the city sources its drinking water. Tacoma attempted to block access to the town, leading to protests {{and the destruction of}} gates on the only all-weather road leading to Lester, in an incident known as the [...] "Battle of the Lester Gate". King County sued the city of Tacoma over blocking access to Lester, arguing that the road was owned by the county. The King County Superior Court ruled in Tacoma's favor in July 1962 to temporarily keep locks on its Lester gates. The court later determined in 1965 that the county's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> include other landowners in the suit hampered the court's abilities <b>to</b> <b>adjudicate</b> the case.|$|R
