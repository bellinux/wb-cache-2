50|$|MotionSupervisor {{acts as an}} {{interface}} between the Motion Control Loop, the Orchestra GCode, the ControllerSupervisor and the Logical Control Loop. Using information from the ControllerSupervisor, it selects either automatic or <b>jog</b> <b>mode.</b> In <b>jog</b> <b>mode,</b> MotionSupervisor provides axes to moves, direction and feed rates. In automatic and in semiautomatic mode, instructions on movement {{will come from the}} G-Code interpreter. The MotionSupervisor also collects error messages coming from the MotionControl Loop and sends them to the ControllerSupervisor.|$|E
5000|$|The CDJ-800 uses a {{different}} {{mechanism for the}} jog wheel than the 1000 - it can perform [...] "quick return" [...] if the top surface of the wheel is pressed, then released. The general design purpose of the CDJ-800 was to offer DJ's the facilities {{they have in the}} club on CDJ-1000's at home for a lower price. While the CDJ-1000 has a button to override the pitch slider, the CDJ-800 slider has a center detent, which is [...] "easy to center." [...] The CDJ-800 does not have the CDJ-1000's [...] "hot cue" [...] feature, and has only [...] "one cue, and one loop" [...] at a time, though these can be saved for up to 500 CDs. [...] The CDJ-800 can alter loop [...] "out-points" [...] while playing, but can't alter in-points; loops must be re-captured. Though the CDJ-1000 will relay (alternate CDs) in both vinyl and CDJ jog modes, the CDJ-800 will only relay in CDJ <b>jog</b> <b>mode.</b> The CDJ-800 also has an [...] "auto-beat" [...] function that the 1000 does not.|$|E
5000|$|The CMX-3000 was Pioneer's second {{attempt to}} enter the market of {{rack-mountable}} dual deck CD-players. Released {{in the wake of}} the CDJ-1000, the player was - and still is - often mistakenly advertised as a 19" [...] inch rack mountable equivalent of dual CDJ-1000's even though the intended target audiences for the products, as well as their comparative pricing, were entirely in different leagues. The misconception is possibly caused by the fact that while Pioneer's earlier dual deck CD-player, the CMX-5000, only had a jog wheel comparable to earlier single deck CD-players for doing pitch bending, the CMX-3000 also allowed distinct <b>jog</b> <b>mode</b> that enabled the user to use the jog wheel for scratching, a feature that thus far was only available on the top-of-the line CDJ-1000. The jog wheel however relies upon the movement of the wheel itself and is not touch sensitive as it is on the CDJ-1000, CDJ-800 and CDJ-400. Therefore, the scratch is intended as an effect or for cueing a track, and is not appropriate for stopping the track by touch as it is on the other CDJ models.|$|E
5000|$|Power Console (PI-PD7) - An {{unreleased}} cockpit-sized controller that attaches {{onto the}} SuperGraph unit itself, connecting via the expansion port {{on the front}} side. The peripheral would've added numerous control options such as an eight-way joystick, four action buttons, a flight yoke with two triggers (one on each handle), a throttle lever, a <b>jog</b> dial, three <b>mode</b> switches, an LCD panel, an LED indicator, four additional controller ports and a numerical keypad. The Power Console {{was scheduled to be}} released in Spring 1990 with a suggested retail price of 59,800 yen, but was never released due to its high production cost and the poor sales of the SuperGrafx itself.|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} massively parallel 3 D molecular dynamics simulations {{with up to}} 35 million atoms to investigate ductile fracture. We have obtained mechanistic information at the atomistic level inaccessible to experiment. We observe dislocation loops emitted from the crack front [...] -the first time this has been seen in computer simulations. The sequence of dislocation emission (crack blunting process) strongly depends on the crystallographic orientation of the crack front and differs strikingly from anything previously conjectured. We find that dislocation emission <b>modes,</b> <b>jogging</b> or blunting, {{are very sensitive to}} boundary conditions and interatomic potentials. Understanding the fracture behavior of materials is crucial to the development of new materials with high strength and toughness. Cracks and dislocations are the two major defects determining these mechanical properties. While continuum theory can successfully describe the long-range strain fields of cracks and dislocations, a [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Development and {{investigation}} of a dynamic model of electric drive {{on the base of}} the rolling rotor motor (RRM) which reflects the positioning of the actuator of the locking and regulating equipment in time. Methodology. Analytical description of electromagnetic and mechanical processes in the electric drive during the RRM shaft movement by using a system of differential equations. Numerical imitation modeling with the processes visualization in the Matlab environment of the RRM rotor displacement with mechanical load in time. Results. It is shown that the degree of influence {{of the value of the}} load inertia on the dynamics of the object obtained by the waveform changes the rotation angle of the rotor and motor speed in time. The degree of influence of the value of the electromagnetic time constant of the dynamics of the positioning of the actuator, and the nature of transients during acceleration and fixing position of the rotor with a predetermined moment of inertia for different values of inductance. The effect of the ratio of electromechanical and electromagnetic time constants of the nature of the transition processes accompanying <b>jog</b> <b>mode</b> angular displacement of the drive shaft on the base of RRM. Originality. The lack of technical means to ensure acceptable accuracy time measurement of angular displacement shaft of the actuator in <b>jog</b> <b>mode</b> offset by using a laser meter which gives the opportunity to assess the adequacy of the dynamic model of the RRM. Practical value. The results of investigations allow to create a tool for optimization of structural, technical and hardware and software solutions for the improvement and modernization of the projected electric locking and regulating equipment. The direction for improving the dynamics of the drive on the basis of RRM is indicated providing for an increase in its torque characteristics of the motor by reducing the influence of the parameters of transients...|$|E
