40|$|Background: An 80 -year-old woman {{presented}} with an abrupt onset of asymptomatic black-to-purple discoloration {{of her right}} limb that appeared just before a thyroid <b>gammagraphy.</b> No antecedent of trauma was found. Case presentation: On questioning, patient admitted she did not cooperate during intravenous administration of Tc- 99 m-pertechnetate. Based on the abrupt onset of lesions {{and the absence of}} cooperation during intravenous administration of radiotracer, a suspect diagnosis of technetium and blood extravasation was made. This entity was confirmed in basis of evolution, with a spontaneous resolution of lesions within the next 15 days with no complications. Conclusion: Patient and physicians must be reassured because of the non-vesicant property of technetium. Recovery of this entity is spontaneous, and no treatment is needed.

40|$|According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a {{relatively}} {{significant number of}} radiological accidents have occurred in recent years {{mainly because of the}} practices referred to as potentially high-risk activities, such as radiotherapy, large irradiators and industrial radiography, especially in <b>gammagraphy</b> assays. In some instances, severe injuries have occurred in exposed persons due to high radiation doses. In industrial radiography, 80 cases involving a total of 120 radiation workers, 110 members of the public including 12 deaths have been recorded up to 2014. Radiological accidents in industrial practices in Brazil have mainly resulted in development of cutaneous radiation syndrome (CRS) in hands and fingers. Brazilian data include 5 serious cases related to industrial <b>gammagraphy,</b> affecting 7 radiation workers and 19 members of the public; however, none of them were fatal. Some methods of reconstructive dosimetry have been used to estimate the radiation dose to assist in prescribing medical treatment. The type and development of cutaneous manifestations in the exposed areas of a person is the first achievable gross dose estimation. This review article presents the state-of-the-art reconstructive dosimetry methods enabling estimation of local radiation doses and provides guidelines for medical handling of the exposed individuals. The review also presents the Chilean and Brazilian radiological accident cases to highlight the importance of reconstructive dosimetry...|$|E
40|$|In the Nuclear Medicine service {{multitude}} of diagnostic tests are performed, {{being one of}} them the bone <b>gammagraphy</b> that acquires {{a very important role}} both by the high demand for this test, because of its simplicity and in the realization by its high sensitivity. The bone <b>gammagraphy</b> as opposed to conventional radiological techniques not only provides an anatomical view, but also adds a functional imaging that provides information on bone metabolism. Addition is not restricted to malignant bone disease (primary or metastatic tumors), but it is very useful for most benign osteoarticular processes. It would be interesting to bring to the nursing knowledge of this test for a proper implementation of it, because it is a very defendant but unknown to many nurses, thus going to unify the standards of performance. The need for nursing professionals during the performance of this technique because the patient remains in these units for quite some time, being responsible for the care while they remain in the unit, taking their physical, psychological and social. We also have a key role in providing information and reassurance when the patient arrives at the unit and it is therefore necessary to have information and training necessary to answer these key questions...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: We {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} the findings of the renal <b>gammagraphy</b> (99 mTc-DTPA) taken in the first 24 hours after the transplant in the survival of the kidney transplant. Materials and method: We retrospectively studied 413 kidney transplants carried out between January 1994 and December 2008, with emphasis on normal gammagraphic findings or alterations in the vascular, parenchymal and excretory stages, as well as their effect on the survival of the graft. Results: Of the 413 transplants, 44 (10. 7 %) presented alterations in the vascular stage, 256 (62 %) in the parenchymal stage and 269 (65. 1 %) in the excretory stage. The mean follow-up of the entire group was 72. 5 months (± 54. 1 DE). The univariate analysis shows that the survival of the graft is significantly less in patients with alterations in the vascular stage (OR: 3; IC 95 % 1. 9 — 4. 9 p < 0. 001), in the excretory stage (OR: 2. 5; IC 95 % 1. 5 - 4; p = < 0. 001) in the parenchymal stage (OR: 2. 21; IC 95 % 1. 3 - 3. 36; p = 0. 001). The multivariate studies of the gammagraphic variables that affect the survival of the graft show that the presence of alterations in the vascular stage (OR: 3; IC 95 % 1. 9 - 4. 9; p < 0. 001) in the parenchymal stage (OR: 2; IC 95 % 1. 2 - 3. 3; p = 0. 005) are directly related to survival. This data is also confirmed by means of the actuarial survival analysis of the graft at 3 and 5 years. Conclusions: The presence of alterations in the vascular stage and in the parenchymal stage of the renal <b>gammagraphy</b> immediately after the transplant are variables that affect the survival of the graft...|$|E
40|$|Twenty {{percent of}} all lung cancers are of small cells (CPCP). More than half occur to people aged 60 and more. Due to its fast dissemination, most of them show {{symptoms}} when diagnosed (90 %). These symptoms {{can be derived from}} its locoregional extension, metastases or can have a paraneoplastical origin. Anamnesis and thorough physical exploration are essential for the initial evaluation and adequate treatment. In addition to a blood analysis with determination of enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenase which helps in prognosis, thorax and abdominal computed tomography (CT), bone <b>gammagraphy</b> and cerebral CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow optimum estadification. Although CPCP is chemo- and radio-sensitive, small progress has been achieved in the last years and its mortality rate is high. The objective {{of this paper is to}} revise all these aspects related to CPCP...|$|E
40|$|Multiple myeloma is a {{monoclonal}} malignant {{proliferation of}} plasma cells that causes osteolytic lesions in the vertebrae, ribs, pelvic bone, skull and jaw. We {{report on a}} clinical case of an 81 -year-old male patient who presented with a tumefaction in the mandibular symphysis region, which had evolved over the previous seven months. In the radiographic examination, an extensive osteolytic lesion was observed in the region mentioned above. An incisional biopsy was performed and a histopathological study revealed a malignant hematopoietic neoplasm formed by plasmacytoid cells. During the bone <b>gammagraphy</b> a dissemination of the disease was detected in the scapula, clavicle and ribs. The diagnosis was multiple myeloma. Knowledge about the maxillofacial manifestations of multiple myeloma {{is important for the}} early diagnosis of the disease, since its primary form can manifest itself in the jaw.

40|$|The authors {{discuss the}} epidemiology, histology, symptomatology, {{diagnosis}} and therapy of carotid body tumors, basing their discussion on three personal observations {{and on a}} case of cervical dermatocyst which showed clinical and radiological data consistent with diagnosis of a glomus tumor. Chemodectomas of the neck are more often seen in the carotid body and are considered histologically benign, although they might induce local or distant metastases. Clinical presentation is often non-specific and may only consist in a slowly growing mass in the higher jugular-carotid region. Among the various imaging techniques (CT, MR), supra-aortic selective angiography, including digital subtraction techniques, is now considered the most reliable tool, while ultrasonography and <b>gammagraphy</b> with 99 mTc-gluconate or 131 I-MBG are recommended for screening and family testing purposes. Biopsy is to be avoided as {{it is very likely}} to cause massive bleeding and because of the high percentage of false negatives. Surgery is the choice treatment, and lateral cervicotomy is the recommended approach for exeresis of the mass, while radiotherapy should be planned in patients with precise contra-indications for surgery and when the tumor mass has already reached the skull base. Pre-operatory selective embolization is still controversial...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} the risk factors associated with the presentation of brucellosis on the spine, and determine the strength of association between these factors. METHODS: The medical records of patients with brucellosis on the spine were analyzed and a spreadsheet was created to compile the following data: age, sex, place of origin and residence, risk factors (exposure at work, consumption of unpasteurized products and comorbidities), clinical presentation (lumbar pain, anorexia, headache, myalgia, fatigue, paresthesia, dysesthesia, muscle weakness, weight loss, fever), affected spine level, presence of abscesses, disease duration (acute, subacute, chronic), laboratory studies (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, serology, blood culture, Rose Bengal test, histopathological reports), imaging studies (x-rays, MRI, bone <b>gammagraphy),</b> established treatment (medical and/or surgical), therapeutic failure and sequelae. RESULTS: A total of 17 patients, 10 women (58. 8 %) and seven men (41. 2 %), were reviewed from January 2007 to January 2011. The group had a mean age of 57. 8 years with a standard deviation of + 13. 91 and age range between 16 - 74 years. CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant difference between the groups compared with respect to age and sex, however, improvement of the neurological deficit was observed in eight patients who underwent surgical procedure...|$|E
40|$|Fibrous {{dysplasia}} (FD) is {{a condition}} in which normal bone marrow is replaced by an abnormal proliferation of new fibrous connective tissue. Female patient, white, 20 years old, attended the dental clinic reporting a slow increase in volume in the right mandible region over the last 5 years. She was examined by imaging: the panoramic X-ray revealed a lesion with the appearance of ground glass while the cone-beam computed tomography showed an extensive lesion in the region of the right hemimandible. The histopathological examination was compatible with fibrous dysplasia. Bone <b>gammagraphy</b> was indicated, plus an endocrinological study to eliminate polyostotic forms, which produced a negative result. Monostotic fibrous dysplasia in the right hemimandible was diagnosed. Conservative surgery was carried out and after 1 year recurrence of the tumour was observed. We may conclude that conservative surgery might not be the best choice for treatment for monostotic fibrous dysplasia in the mandible and that other options must be considered, such as radical surgery or the use of bisphosphonates. In our study, we may also conclude that {{it is very important to}} explain to the patient the possibility of recurrence of the lesion and the need for monitoring with periodic imaging studies...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{present the}} cases of two young patients, {{a man and a}} woman, who {{presented}} with myocardial infarction, in the absence of ischemic heart disease or stenosis of the coronary arteries. The woman was known to have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) for the past 3 years (the immunoglobulin M [IgM] anticardiolipins antibodies were positive), without a history of coronary risk factors. Suddenly she presented with acute chest pain on rest that lasted 4 hours and culminated in anterior wall myocardial infarction. She was admitted to the coronary care unit, where no thrombolysis was given. She did not have echocardiographic evidence of Libman-Sacks endocarditis, but myocardial infarction was evident at the electrocardiogram (ECG). The young man had SLE (the IgM anticardi-olipins were absent, but he was positive for lupus anticoagulant antibodies), he was hyperlipidemic, was a moderate smoker and moderately obese, and had no history of ischemic heart disease. He suddenly presented with an acute myocardial infarction docu-mented by ECG, enzymes, and <b>gammagraphy.</b> In both patients, coronary angiography findings were normal and myocardial biopsy did not show evidence of arteritis. The relevance of these cases is the rare association of ischemic heart disease in SLE, with normal coronary arteries and without evidence of arteritis or verrucous endocarditis...|$|E
40|$|CIGB- 300 is a pro-apoptotic casein kinase 2 {{inhibitor}} peptide {{with potential}} anticancer action. An open-label and dose scaling Phase I trial {{was carried out}} to investigate the peptide tumor uptake, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and levels of a CIGB- 300 response biomarker in patients with cervical cancer stage IB 2 /II. Fourteen patients were included; six of them received 35 mg, 6 received 70 mg and the two remaining patients received 245 mg of CIGB- 300 prior chemoradiotherapy. CIGB- 300 was applied by intratumor injections during 5 -consecutive days. For pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies, the peptide was radiolabeled with 99 mTc in the first administration and whole body <b>gammagraphy</b> and plasma testing were done during 48 h. Data showed that the maximum tolerated dose was 70 mg for CIGB- 300 in this clinical setting. Furthermore, an allergic-like syndrome was identified as the dose limiting toxicity, which was well-correlated with plasmatic histamine levels. Importantly, the mean tumor uptake was 14. 9 mg and 10. 4 mg for CIGB- 300 doses of 35 and 70 mg, respectively. Also, the kidneys were the main target organ for drug elimination. Finally, treatment with CIGB- 300 significantly reduced the B 23 /nucleophosmin levels in tumor specimens. CIGB- 300 meets potentialities to be tested in future trials in a neoadjuvant setting prior to chemoradiotherapy in cervical cancer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Brown {{tumors are}} a rare focal manifestation of osteitis fibrosa cystica, which results from hyperparathyroidism. Chronic kidney failure {{may lead to}} {{secondary}} or tertiary hyperparathyroidism and thus to osteitis fibrosa cystica and brown tumors. Case presentation A 60 -year-old man {{with a history of}} diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney failure presented with a 15 -day history of dyspnea, cough, malaise and fever. Initially, there was little correlation between his history and his physical examination. Various pulmonary, cardiac and infectious etiologies were ruled out. A chest X-ray showed a costal mass that was further verified by tomography and <b>gammagraphy.</b> The mass was suspected of being neoplastic. After a failed biopsy, the mass was removed surgically and on histopathology was compatible with a giant-cell tumor versus a brown tumor caused by hyperparathyroidism. Laboratory tests showed elevated calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone concentrations. The patient was diagnosed with a brown tumor secondary to refractory hyperparathyroidism. Conclusion Tending towards a diagnosis because it is more frequent or it implies more risk for the patient may delay the consideration of other diagnostic options that, although rare, fit well into the clinical context. The patient presented here was suspected to have an osseous neoplasia that would have had major implications for the patient. However, reassessment of the case led to the diagnosis of a brown tumor. Brown tumors should be an important diagnostic consideration in patients with chronic kidney failure who have secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism and an osseous mass. </p...|$|E
40|$|General {{simulated}} scenes These scenes {{followed a}} pre-defined script (see the Thesis for details), with common movements corresponding to general experiments. People go to or stand still {{in front of}} "J 9 ", and/or go {{to the side of}} Argonauta reactor and come back again. The first type of movement is common during Irradiation experiments, where a material sample is put within the "J 9 " channel; and also during neutrongraphy or <b>gammagraphy</b> experiments, where a sample is placed in front of "J 9 ". Here, the detailed movements of putting samples on these places were not reproduced in details, but only the whole bodies' movements were simulated (as crouching or being still in front of "J 9 "). The second type of movement may occur when operators go to the side of Argonauta to verify some operational condition. - Scene 1 (Obs. : Scene 1 of the "General simulated scenes" class) : Comprises one of the scenes with two persons.

40|$|Reduced uptake of 123 I- metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) on cardiac <b>gammagraphy</b> and {{impaired}} odor identification are {{markers of}} neurodegenerative diseases with Lewy bodies (LB) as a pathological hallmark, such as idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD). LRRK 2 patients present with a clinical syndrome indistinguishable from IPD, but LB {{have not been}} found in some cases. Patients with such mutations could behave differently than patients with IPD with respect to MIBG cardiac uptake and olfaction. We studied 14 LRRK 2 patients, 14 IPD patients matched by age, gender, disease duration and severity, and 13 age and gender matched control subjects. Olfaction was analyzed through the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). MIBG cardiac uptake was evaluated through the H/M ratio. The late H/M was 1. 44  ±  0. 31 for LRRK 2 patients, 1. 19  ±  0. 15 for PD patients, and 1. 67  ±  0. 16 for control subjects. LRRK 2 patients presented lower but not statistically significant MIBG cardiac uptake than controls (p =  0. 08) and significant higher uptake than PD patients (p =  0. 04). UPSIT mean scores were 21. 5  ±  7. 3 for LRRK 2 patients, 18. 7  ±  6. 2 for IPD patients and 29. 7  ±  5. 7 for control subjects. UPSIT score was lower in both LRRK 2 and PD than in controls. In LRRK 2 patients a positive correlation was found between myocardial MIBG uptake and UPSIT scores, (R =  0. 801, p <  0. 001). In LRRK 2 patients, MIBG cardiac uptake was less impaired than in PD; {{a positive correlation between}} MIBG cardiac uptake and UPSIT scores was observed. As MIBG cardiac reduced uptake and impaired odor identification are markers of LB pathology, this findings may represent neuropathological heterogeneity among LRRK 2 patients...|$|E
