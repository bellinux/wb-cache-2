In 2013, Davis and the American Nonprofits board explored the viability of creating a national credit union; they received preliminary field of membership approval from the National Credit Union Administration to serve 501(c)(3) nonprofits, their employees, volunteers and stakeholders, and they created a start-up and 4-year business plan. At the beginning of 2014, Davis announced that, while many parties were interested in the credit union project, American Nonprofits was not able to raise $10.5 million in starting capital at that time, so the credit union was temporarily put on hold.|$|R

The CCRC is designed to cater to independent older adults. The CCRC offers leisure and social activities, such as swimming pools, lectures, arts and crafts classes, and gymnasiums. Each unit {{is equipped with a}} kitchenette and an emergency call but-ton, and cleaning and doorman services are available (King, 2004). Because the CCRC is also designed to serve as the “final move, ” it usually also includes nurs-ing and assisted-living units {{to meet the needs of}} the residents as they age (Hays, Galanos, Palmer, McQuoid, & Flint, 2001). Older adults have much at stake when deciding whether to move to a CCRC. First, many older adults commit much of their life savings to the CCRC, which typically requires large deposits (e. g., more than $ 100, 000 US) as well as monthly <b>fees.</b> These <b>deposits</b> <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> are usually not refundable, so if they are dissatisfied with the move to the CCRC, they either must tolerate an unsatisfactory living arrangement for the rest of their lives or lose a substantial amount of money to relocate (Biton, 2010).

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} shows that the supply of deposits to checking accounts is not elastic {{with respect to the}} interest rates paid. That suggests that various features attached to checking accounts may be important in determining the supply of <b>deposits</b> <b>and</b> banks' and revenues from the fees. This study uses a national survey of checking accounts offered by financial institutions in 25 major metropolitan areas in the United States to analyze the effects of restrictions <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> imposed on checking account holders on the supply of <b>deposits</b> <b>and</b> on the banks' check fee revenues. The author places particular emphasis on relatively new restrictions designed to induce customers to adopt cost-saving behavior, such as restrictions on the return of canceled checks and on the use of live tellers. She finds the supply of deposits into checking accounts to be responsive to the bank's per-item fees, check return restrictions, teller restrictions, <b>and</b> foreign ATM <b>fees.</b> Because of this sensitivity of deposit supply, raising most of those fees was found to lower bank revenues from servicing the checking accounts.

40|$|Life-cycle {{inventory}} and cost-analysis tools applied to milk packaging offer guidelines for achieving better environmen-tal design {{and management of}} these systems. Life-cycle solid waste, energy, and costs were analyzed for seven sys-tems including single-use and refillable glass bottles, single-use and refillable high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles, paperboard gable-top cartons, linear low-density polyeth-ylene (LLDPE) flexible pouches, and polycarbonate refill-able bottles on a basis of 1, 000 gal of milk delivered. In addition, performance requirements were also investigated that highlighted potential barriers and trade-offs for envi-ronmentally preferable alternatives. Sensitivity analyses, in-dicated that material production energy, postconsumer solid waste, and empty container costs were key param-eters for predicting life-cycle burdens and costs. Recent trends in recycling rates, tipping <b>fees,</b> <b>and</b> recycled materi-als market value had minimal effect on the results. Inven-tory model results for life-cycle solid waste and energy indicated the same rank order as results from previously published life-cycle inventory studies of container systems. Refillable HDPE and polycarbonate, and the flexible pouch were identified as the most environmentally prefer-able with respect to life-cycle energy and solid waste. The greater market penetration of these containers may be lim-ited by performance issues such as empty container stor-age, handling requirements, <b>and</b> <b>deposit</b> <b>fees</b> for refillables, <b>and</b> resealability and puncture resistance for the pouch.

25|$|Although {{the deposit}} {{is in the}} hands of the credit card issuer as {{security}} in the event of default by the consumer, the deposit will not be debited simply for missing one or two payments. Usually the deposit is only used as an offset when the account is closed, either at the request of the customer or due to severe delinquency (150 to 180 days). This means that an account which is less than 150 days delinquent will continue to accrue interest <b>and</b> <b>fees,</b> <b>and</b> could result in a balance which is much higher than the actual credit limit on the card.

40|$|This report explores {{public opinion}} on a new and {{promising}} concept—green transportation taxes <b>and</b> <b>fees.</b> These are taxes <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> set at variable rates, with higher rates for more polluting vehicles and lower rates for those that pollute less. This approach to transportation taxes <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> adapts the traditional transportation finance system to achieve two critical public benefits at once: encouraging drivers to choose more environmentally-friendly transportation options and raising revenue for needed transportation programs. To test public support for green transportation taxes <b>and</b> <b>fees,</b> the authors conducted a random telephone survey of 1, 500 Californians that asked respondents their views on five hypothetical tax <b>and</b> <b>fee</b> options: a flat-rate and a green vehicle registration <b>fee,</b> a flat-rate <b>and</b> a green mileage <b>fee,</b> <b>and</b> a “feebate” program for new vehicle purchases under which more-polluting vehicles would be charged a tax and less-polluting vehicles would receive a rebate. The survey {{results show that the}} concept of green transportation taxes <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> strongly appeals to Californians. The survey tested this in two ways: by testing support for the three hypothetical green transportation tax <b>and</b> <b>fee</b> policies, <b>and</b> also by comparing support levels for flat-rate versus green versions of two taxes. Majorities of the respondents supported all three green taxes <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> tested. Another striking finding from the survey is that support for the green taxes <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> did not vary greatly by population subgroups; a diverse range of Californians supported the green taxes <b>and</b> <b>fees.</b> An analysis comparing support for the green and flat-rate vehicle registration <b>fee</b> <b>and</b> feebate proposals confirmed that in every subgroup, more people within that subgroup supported the green than the flat version of the two taxes tested...|$|R
