5|$|In 1955 the Bergen businessperson Fritz Rieber {{launched}} {{an idea for}} the shortening of Bergensbanen; the Ulriken Tunnel through the Bergen mountains, electrification from Voss to Bergen, {{and the construction of}} the Ringerike Line. Private financing would be provided through a dedicated limited company taking a surcharge on tickets, equal to the reduction in fare induced by the shorter line; within twenty years the debt would be covered. Passed by parliament in 1955, a year later they had changed their minds and only the investments around Bergen were supported; removing the support for Ringerike. Prime Minister Trygve Bratteli commented that private <b>debt</b> <b>financing</b> would have to compete with the debt taken up by the government on other railway projects, since politicians had to see the national economy as a whole, and that private financing would not allow more lines to be built.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the extent of access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> and its determinants among SMEs in Uganda using the “Applied and Received” approach (ARa). In addition, supplementary to the main research objective, the thesis had two subsidiary objectives; firstly, to examine the effect of measuring access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> by comparing two approaches, the “Received” (Ra) and “Applied and Received” (ARa), to the extent and determinants of access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance.</b> Secondly, to examine if there are significant differences in the way SMEs and financiers perceive effective lending rates, transaction costs, firm age, firm size, industry, financial transparency, collateral, education, entrepreneurial experience and gender as determinants of access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance.</b> To achieve the {{main objective}} and two subsidiary objectives, a survey was conducted based on a population of 128, 000 SMEs, out of which a sample of 384 was considered appropriate, according to random tables by Sekaran and Bougie (2013). From the financiers’ side, a population of 25 commercial banks, 22 insurance companies, 50 registered trade credit suppliers and a sample of 10 credit service bureaus, 10 MFIs and 10 SACCOs were used {{for the purposes of this}} study. The response rate was 57 % from the SMEs and 62 % from the financiers. In terms of analysis, the extent of access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> was examined using descriptive statistics. In addition, Pearson’s correlation coefficient was employed to determine the relationship between access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> and its determinants and binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine the strength of the relationships between access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> and the determinants. Overall, the model explained up to 73. 3 % of the variation in access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance.</b> Finally, the independent samples t-test was used to determine if there were significant variations and consensus between SMEs and financiers with regard to the determinants of access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance.</b> The findings of the study contribute to the literature in a number of ways; first, the conventional measures (“Received”, “Loan size” and “Frequency of acquisition” approaches) have understated the extent of access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance,</b> while the “Applied and Received” approach (ARa) is a superior measure of the extent of this among SMEs in Uganda. This is because the ARa focuses on active borrowers and not discouraged borrowers or those SMEs that have voluntarily excluded themselves from external credit. Second, the study provides empirical evidence of the determinants of access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> for the first time in Uganda where such evidence was previously unknown. Third, the study documents significant differences in the perceptions of the determinants of access to debt from the SMEs and suppliers of <b>debt</b> <b>finance.</b> However, the ARa has limitations; for example, the degree to which discouraged borrowers can be excluded is open to debate. This is because, unlike voluntary excluded borrowers (not seeking funding at all), discouraged borrowers want debt but do not seek it because they think it will not be granted. The most important implication of this research to policy makers and academics is the methodology of operationalising access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> using the ARa. This approach deals with voluntary exclusion and reports higher rates of access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> compared to the Ra, which helps policy makers to estimate the financing gap among SMEs in Uganda. Likewise, the ARa includes additional determinants of access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> variables, which suggests that SMEs seeking finance are aware of the factors that financiers consider in the credit scoring process. Secondly, for SMEs and financiers, the findings concerning the consensus and variations in the determinants of access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> are of great value to educate policy makers on the information gap existing between the demand and supply sides. Knowledge of the determinants of access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> from the financiers’ side will improve access among SMEs in Uganda because financiers play a pivotal role in the issue of this finance...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{investigates the}} impact of {{entrepreneurial}} orientation (EO) on access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> and performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Inaccessibility to <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> {{is one of the}} primary causes of failure and weak performance of SMEs in South Africa. The survey area was King William’s Town and East London in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. Data was collected through the use of self-administered questionnaires in a survey. Data was analysed through the use of descriptive statistics, correlation and regression. The Cronbach’s alpha was used to measure reliability. The results indicate that there is a significant positive relationship between EO and access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> and the performance of SMEs. The results also indicate that access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> partially mediates the relationship between EO and the performance of SMEs.

ABSTRACT: This study sought to investigate {{the factors that influence}} access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> by Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) in Chwele Town, Bungoma County. The categories of firms under study were all registered MSEs in operation at the time. The study examined the following objectives: to determine the effect of Collateral security on access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance,</b> to establish effect of financial information on access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> and to determine the effect of managerial competence on access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance.</b> The study employed a descriptive research design. The target population was 256 MSEs from which a sample size of 120 MSEs was selected using Nassiuma (2000) formula. Data was collected using self-administered questionnaires. The raw data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression. The first study objective sought to establish the relationship between the Collateral security and access to <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> by MSEs in Chwele Township. It was established that most of the respondents had not pledged Collateral security for finance while. Most of the indicated that the nature of the Collateral security offered was private property which included their land. The study further established that respondents who could not provide Collateral security had their finance requests declined.

40|$|There are {{competing}} 'views' {{on the economic}} effects of <b>debt</b> <b>finance.</b> One view argues that tax and <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> have identical effects on various economic measures, a view sometimes termed 'Ricardian Equivalence'. However, this 'Ricardian view' remains controversial, with other views (the 'Keynesian view' and the 'Neoclassical view') concluding that <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> {{is likely to have}} significant impacts on consumption, interest rates, and the current account. Empirical tests of these competing views, conducted mainly for developed countries, have failed to generate much consensus, and there are few studies for developing countries, especially a developing country that is heavily dependent on natural resources (e. g., oil). This paper provides a battery of empirical tests on the effects of government <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> in one developing country, Indonesia. We focus on three empirical tests: effects on consumption, on interest rates, and on the current account balance. We find, across virtually all of our time series tests, that Ricardian Equivalence does not hold; that is, the predictions of the Ricardian paradigm are consistently and strongly rejected by most of our estimation results. The only results that tend to give some support to Ricardian Equivalence are those that recognize the importance of oil in the Indonesian economy. Even so, our results generally indicate that <b>debt</b> <b>finance</b> will increase the interest rate, will increase current consumption at the expense of future consumption, and will retard exports and stimulate imports through currency appreciation...|$|R

25|$|In 1991, the Finnish economy {{fell into}} a severe recession. This {{was caused by a}} {{combination}} of economic overheating (largely due to a change in the banking laws in 1986 which made credit much more accessible), depressed markets with key trading partners (particularly the Swedish and Soviet markets) as well as local markets, slow growth with other trading partners, and the disappearance of the Soviet bilateral trade. Stock market and housing prices declined by 50%. The growth in the 1980s was based on debt, and when the defaults began rolling in, GDP declined by 13% and unemployment increased from a virtual full employment to one fifth of the workforce. The crisis was amplified by trade unions' initial opposition to any reforms. Politicians struggled to cut spending and the public debt doubled to around 60% of GDP. Much of the economic growth in the 1980s was based on <b>debt</b> <b>financing,</b> and the debt defaults led to a savings and loan crisis.
