Koppett said that Alston's loyalty and subdued nature contributed to the stability that the team enjoyed.

500|$|Pitchfork Media {{said that}} while Acid Tongue is [...] "immediately pleasurable," [...] the album's {{downfall}} is that [...] "Lewis does {{such a good job}} of nailing choice sounds and styles from pop's past that you can't help getting reeled in right away; only upon later reflection <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> that much of her success lies in evoking something else great rather than achieving a greatness more uniquely her own." [...] The review continued, [...] "In these straitjacketed settings, Lewis' considerable strengths as a lyricist and performer just aren't given sufficient room to fully emerge." [...] Time noted that Acid Tongue [...] "sprawl with misplaced ambition" [...] and that only the title track sticks. Another review observed, [...] "Lewis seems to be [...] on her way to a more definitive musical existence [...] but she doesn’t quite seem to know yet." [...] Acid Tongue was also slated for its [...] "hip-hop-like roster of unnecessary cameos. Zooey Deschanel and M. Ward of She and Him make sense, but Elvis Costello sounds intrusive during his duet on [...] "Carpetbaggers," [...] while the black Crowes' Chris Robinson is just superfluous." [...] Crawdaddy!s Zimmerman {{said that while}} [...] "these appearances help flavor the record, [...] I miss the Watson Twins." ...|$|E
