40|$|The {{ultrafiltration}} membranes fouled by proteins {{are typically}} cleaned by consecutive soaking in alkali, surfactant and oxidizing solutions. We combined all three chemicals into a <b>formulated</b> <b>cleaning</b> agent and examined its efficiency {{to restore the}} water flux without damaging the membrane or enhancing protein fouling. Lower concentrations of ingredients in the composite were required to restore the water flux to the initial level. The membrane after the cleaning remained intact and subsequent filtration left trace protein amount on the membrane surface. We propose a mechanism of cleaning based on a fast penetration of alkali and oxidizing ingredients through a fouling layer and efficient micellation of detached foulants with surfactant...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{cleaning}} of ultrafiltration membranes is often considered successful when the flux through a cleaned membrane {{is much higher}} than through a pristine one. Here, a novel definition of cleaning intensity is proposed as the product of the concentration of the cleaning agent and the cleaning time (Ct), and it is shown that Ct values between 0. 5 and 1. 0 ?g?h?L 1 are sufficient for effective cleaning. Experiments with PES- 30 and PVDF- 30 membranes fouled by bovine serum albumin and cleaned with surfactant, oxidant, and <b>formulated</b> <b>cleaning</b> agents demonstrate that a good cleaning should last for 1020 ?min and restore the flux through a virgin membrane. More intensive cleaning increases the membrane hydrophilicity and the water flux, but soon causes more severe fouling and even membrane disintegration...|$|E

Azeotropic blends of solvents have been proposed as an alternative for maintaining consistent solvent composition throughout the evaporation process while benefiting from their high vapor pressure relative to the pure solvents.

40|$|The {{control of}} {{perchloroethylene}} (127184) (PERC) exposure in commercial dry cleaning via substitution was reviewed and {{alternatives to the}} use of PERC were discussed. Health hazards associated with PERC included central nervous system depression, liver and kidney damage, memory impairment, dermatitis, respiratory irritation, and other symptoms. Potential alternatives to dry cleaning with PERC included wet cleaning, petroleum based dry cleaning, and liquid carbon-dioxide (CO 2). In terms of fabric deterioration and shrinkage, wet cleaning was suitable for 30 % to 70 % of garments normally dry cleaned with PERC. Most machine wet cleaning techniques incorporated specially <b>formulated</b> wet <b>cleaning</b> detergents and spotting agents, increased water extraction before drying, heat and moisture content monitoring during the drying process, and decreased mechanical action during washing. Advantages of wet cleaning included fewer health, safety, and environmental hazards and regulations, easy removal of some soils, and cost efficiency. Disadvantages of wet cleaning included incomplete PERC replacement, fabric deterioration, shrinkage, difficult removal of some soils, contaminated wastewater, high labor intensity, and ergonomic risks. Although petroleum based solvents were flammable, relatively safe solvents were commercially available. The safety of petroleum based dry cleaning machines was increased through vacuum technology, inert gases, and control of machine operating parameters. Advantages of petroleum based dry cleaning included reduced toxicity and inhalation exposure, effective cleaning of all garments, and reduced costs. Disadvantages of petroleum based dry cleaning included fire hazards, bacteria growth, longer drying process, less effective oil and grease removal, and higher insurance premiums. The recently developed liquid CO 2 method entailed agitating garments immersed in liquid CO 2, then drying the garments via CO 2 vaporization. Advantages of liquid CO 2 included reduced environmental and exposure hazards, reduced cleaning time, and more effective cleaning of certain garments. Disadvantages of liquid CO 2 included safety hazards, stain redeposition, problems removing protein stains, and expense. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 Cover title. "October 1997 " [...] P. [4].

This process {{is often referred to as}} “picture cleaning” and depends on the different solubilities of the obfuscating surface materials and the underlying paint medium. However, differential evaporation rates for the solvents used in these carefully <b>formulated</b> <b>cleaning</b> mixtures can change the potency of the mixture over time, which could potentially lead to solutions having solubility characteristics that are ineffective at cleaning, or worse yet, are deleterious to artists’ oil paints. Azeotropic blends of solvents have been proposed as an alternative for maintaining consistent solvent composition throughout the evaporation process while benefiting from their high vapor pressure relative to the pure solvents. Azeotropes are specific combinations of two or more solvents at a precise concentration that behave as a single solvent, maintaining a constant composition in both the liquid and vapor phases. The use of purportedly azeotropic solvent blends has appeared in the art conservation literature for the cleaning of historic objects and paintings. However, these solvent mixtures are taken from tables of azeotropic compositions given at their boiling point. We have studied one of these solutions, a 19 : 81 vol% mixture of isopropanol and n-hexane. For the first time, the actual evaporation behavior of this purported azeotropic mixture was followed in detail at room temperature conditions. Through the use of rudimentary vapor pressure measurements, gravimetric analysis, as well as sophisticated compositional determinations of both the liquid phase and headspace of evaporating mixtures by gas chromatography, this particular cleaning solution has been shown to be zeotropic (i. e. NOT an azeotrope) under the conditions typical of conservation studios. The true room temperature azeotropic composition was found instead to contain half as much isopropanol at 9. 5 vol%. Art conservators should therefore be dubious of purportedly azeotropic mixtures reported at boiling points well above room temperature. Individual azeotropic cleaning blends are best determined chemically prior to their use in art restoration. Furthermore, the introduction of a model paint film to the evaporating room temperature azeotrope was shown to further confound its behavior, calling into question whether solvent systems can be configured to evaporate with constant composition from the surface of an artwork...|$|E
