5|$|Schubert {{composed}} {{his three}} last sonatas in close succession; furthermore, {{he intended to}} publish them together as a set, as evident by the sonatas' titles. In support of this view that the sonatas are a single unity, pianist and scholar Alfred Brendel has found profound musical links between the sonatas. He {{has argued that the}} sonatas complement <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> different characters, and demonstrated that the entire sonata trilogy is based on the same basic group of intervallic motifs. Moreover, each of the sonatas contains a complex network of inner harmonic and motivic connections linking together all movements, and passages from one movement often reappear, usually transformed, in later movements. Most of these connections are too subtle to be detected during casual listening. In some cases, however, Schubert quotes a theme or passage from an earlier movement with little alteration, inserting it in structurally significant locations, creating an immediately audible allusion. Such explicit connections are related to the cyclic form, one of the musical forms associated with the Romantic period in music.|$|E
5|$|Though usually {{opposing}} <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> {{reporting of}} events, reporting {{by both the}} Epitaph and the Nugget initially supported the lawmen's version of events. Woods, {{the publisher of the}} pro-Cowboy Nugget, was out of town during the hearings, and an experienced reporter, Richard Rule, wrote the story. The Nugget staff had a close relationship with Sheriff Behan, but Rule's story, as printed in the Nugget the day after the shootout, backed up the Earps' version of events. This varied widely from Behan's and the Cowboys' later court testimony. Subsequent stories about the gunfight published in the Nugget after that day supported Behan's and the Cowboys' view of events. Other stories in the Epitaph countered the Nuggets later view entirely and supported the lawmen. In addition, Dr. George Goodfellow, who examined the Cowboys after their death, told the court that the angle of the wound in Billy Clanton's wrist indicated that his hands could not have been in the air, or holding his coats open by the lapels, as witnesses loyal to the Cowboys testified.|$|E

25|$|With the {{expansion}} of the Rugby World Cup from 16 to 20 teams an unusual and complex format was used with the teams split into five pools of four teams with each team playing <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> pool once.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{appealing}} psychological {{aspects of the}} missionary position. It is often regarded as a romantic position because the two partners face each other and may maintain eye contact; there is potentially a greater amount of skin-to-skin contact {{than in any other}} position; and the couple can hold <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> arms, which can easily segue into cuddling when sex is over.

In another version of the story, his mother, Hera casts him off Olympus, deeming him too ugly and deformed to inhabit {{the home of the}} gods. His revenge is to trap his mother in a magic throne. In return for her release, he demands to be given Aphrodite's hand in marriage.|$|E
25|$|The best-documented {{creations of}} new {{species in the}} {{laboratory}} were performed in the late 1980s. William Rice and G.W. Salt bred fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, using a maze with three different choices of habitat, such as light/dark and wet/dry. Each generation was placed into the maze, and the groups of flies {{that came out of}} two of the eight exits were set apart to breed with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> respective groups. After thirty-five generations, the two groups and their offspring were isolated reproductively because of their strong habitat preferences: they mated only within the areas they preferred, and so did not mate with flies that preferred the other areas. The history of such attempts is described in Rice and Hostert (1993).|$|E

25|$|Under Habsburg Charles V, {{ruler of}} the Holy Roman Empire and King of Spain, all fiefs in the current Netherlands region were united into the Seventeen Provinces, which also {{included}} most of present-day Belgium, Luxembourg, and some adjacent land {{in what is now}} France and Germany. In 1568, the Eighty Years' War between the Provinces and their Spanish ruler began. In 1579, the northern half of the Seventeen Provinces forged the Union of Utrecht in which they committed to support <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> defence against the Spanish army. The Union of Utrecht is seen as the foundation of the modern Netherlands. In 1581, the northern provinces adopted the Act of Abjuration, the declaration of independence in which the provinces officially deposed Philip II of Spain as reigning monarch in the northern provinces.|$|E
25|$|The club's {{traditional}} rival was East Stirlingshire, a {{club that}} was also based in Falkirk. The two teams regularly competed against <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> early existences in the Stirlingshire Cup, {{as well as in}} league football following Falkirk's election to the Scottish Football League in 1902–03, two seasons after East Stirlingshire. As of September 2012, the last time the clubs played each other in a competitive league fixture was in April 1982, which East Stirlingshire won 3–0, when both clubs were in the First Division. Following East Stirlingshire's relegation that season, the two clubs have not competed in the same league; Falkirk predominantly in the First Division and East Stirlingshire in the Third Division. In 1999–00 the clubs were drawn against each other {{in the second round of}} the Scottish League Cup, which Falkirk won 2–0 after extra time was played, the last competitive fixture between the clubs excluding the Stirlingshire Cup.|$|E

25|$|Their ratting {{talent and}} unique bond was seized {{upon by the}} city's press. Martin's saloon was a {{favorite}} haunt of newspapermen and journalists, so, with the dogs a fixture outside the bar, they never had to travel far for a story. The exploits of the dogs were recorded in detail in the Californian, Daily Alta California, Daily Morning Call, and Daily Evening Bulletin, the editors vying with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> attempts to endow the pair's adventures with thrills and parallels to the human condition. Bummer was portrayed as the gentleman down on his luck, yet still faithful and conscientious, while Lazarus, the mongrel, was cast {{in the role of}} the sly and self-serving fair-weather friend. When Bummer was shot in the leg after only a couple of months, and Lazarus left him to run with another dog, it suited the press no end: Bummer was said to be feeling the sting of ingratitude at the desertion of the cur he had saved from death. Lazarus' return when Bummer recovered only added to the excitement.|$|E
25|$|Back in 2001 the ICC {{decided to}} create a plan {{designed}} to make all ICC full member countries play each other for Test cricket {{over a period of}} ten years (known as the ICC Ten Year Plan). This was approved in February 2001 by the ICC member countries. Starting from 2002 and running until 2011, it ensured that each Test country played the other nine home and away over a period of ten years, in addition to any matches the individual cricket boards organised on their own. Thus, India and Pakistan played 12 ODIs and 6 Tests against <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> respective countries (not including neutral ground ODI tournaments such as the Asia Cup) from 2004 to April 2005, and played a further series of 3 Tests and 5 ODIs in the winter of 2006. However, because of the rigorous schedule of the Ten Year Plan, there was hardly any time left over to schedule other series, and there were voices criticising the amount of international cricket that is played, with the risk of injury and player burnout as reasons for why this amount should be reduced. The ICC defended their policy, citing the number of international players in English county cricket as a sign that there was not too much cricket for the players.|$|E
