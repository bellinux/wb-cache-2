I {{thought he was going to}} take a bite out of me so I lifted the veil I was wearing and had a stare-down with him and he opened his mouth and let out this huge roar. I got so frightened my heart fell in my shoe. When he finally walked away, the director yelled 'Cut' and I had to take a long breather. But I could really relate to the lion. I feel like in a past life I was a lion or a cat or something." ...|$|E
6000|$|George, who {{had been}} <b>headed</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> direction, slowly {{swivelled}} around and faced his employer. [...] "Bein' a camp cook, I ain't over-burdened with hosses," [...] George enlightened us. [...] "Therefore, I am {{going to try to}} borrow this feller's here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle Alec {{says that}} Uncle Edward says that heads are {{beginning}} {{to go out of}} fashion," [...] I said defiantly--all the more defiantly that I felt I should have had <b>heads</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> sermon. It would doubtless have made a much deeper impression. But the truth was I had forgotten all about such things.|$|R

2500|$|McCartney later {{described}} {{the tone of}} Starr's message as [...] "the party line", to which he reacted badly: [...] "I told [...] to get out. I {{had to do something}} like that in order to assert myself because I was just sinking... I was getting pummelled about the <b>head,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind anyway." [...] According to Starr, McCartney [...] "went crazy", threatening: [...] "I'll finish you now. You'll pay!" [...] Although the other Beatles backed down over the release of McCartney, the confrontation initiated what Rodriguez terms [...] "a three-against-one war" [...] within the band.|$|E

60|$|He {{remained}} {{silent for a}} while and then with a polite smile and a movement of the <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> direction he warned her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{but first}} put your <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> lap, {{for there are}} ants in the grass and I like to see your eyes shine when you spin stories. Tell away." ...|$|E

60|$|She {{turned her}} <b>head</b> swiftly <b>in</b> <b>my</b> direction; {{it was the}} only sign of {{surprise}} she deigned to make. At the same time I stepped into the light and bowed profoundly.|$|R
60|$|She hung her <b>head</b> <b>in</b> silence, whilst <b>my</b> own spirit trembled. Then {{suddenly}} I spoke.|$|R
60|$|The {{hand had}} grown {{suddenly}} very tender as it stroked his feathers. I {{had taken his}} life; I must try to answer for him now. At the thought I raised my head and gave the clear whit-kwit of a running partridge. Instantly the leader answered; the flock sprang to the log again and turned their <b>heads</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> direction to listen. Another call, and now the flock {{dropped to the ground}} and lay close, while the leader drew himself up straight on the log and became part of a dead stub beside him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know the}} feeling, and I'll try what Lucy {{used to do}} to quiet me. Put your poor <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> lap, dear, and lie quite still while I cool and comfort it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had lost}} myself with my elbows {{on my knees}} and my <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hands, but I heard the words distinctly. I heard also the silence which ensued. I sat up and took the {{responsibility}} of the answer on myself.|$|E
60|$|The {{middle of}} a wild and desolate ocean and a voice from Forty-second Street! What manner of {{conjecture}} was this? I clasped my <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hands and tried to think. Suddenly a memory came to me: a wild, surging, raging memory.|$|E
2500|$|After [...] "The Fightin' Side of Me" [...] was released, instead, Haggard later commented to the Wall Street Journal, [...] "People are narrow-minded. Down South {{they might}} have called me a nigger lover." [...] In a 2001 interview, Haggard stated that Nelson, who was also head of the country {{division}} at Capitol at the time, never interfered with his music, but [...] "this one time {{he came out and}} said, 'Merle, I don't believe the world is ready for this yet.' ...

6000|$|Then I groaned miserably {{and took}} my <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hands. [...] "Whither am I to go?" [...] I cried. [...] "What place is there {{in all the world}} for me? I am an outcast. My very home is held against me. Whither, then, shall I go?" ...|$|E

60|$|FRIDAY. Rose {{early and}} tried to sweep out the White House. Had little heart for it. The dust gathers in the corners. How did Roosevelt manage to keep it so clean? An idea!

"Mingo," [...] {{said the}} hunter, {{a little of}} the {{weakness}} of human nature exhibiting itself in the glance of his eye, and the colour on his cheek--"Mingo, your brave called me Hawkeye, I suppose on account of a quick and sartain aim, when he was lying with his <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> lap, afore his spirit started for the Happy Hunting Grounds." ...|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{answered}} me, {{not even}} a stir behind the door. Jacobus's house might have been made empty {{for me to make}} myself at home in. I did not call again. I had become aware of a great discouragement. I was mentally jaded, morally dejected. I turned to the garden again, sitting down with my elbows spread on the low balustrade, and took my <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hands.|$|E
60|$|I turned aside <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> silence, for <b>my</b> {{thoughts}}, at that moment, {{were not}} the thoughts which can be spoken by man to man.|$|R
