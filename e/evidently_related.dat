For a while the region was set apart from central and eastern Denmark, that <b>evidently</b> <b>related</b> more closely to the early Únětice culture across the Baltic Sea.

A similar picture of cultural integration is featured among Bell Beakers in central Europe, thus challenging previous theories of Bell Beakers as an elitist or purely super-structural phenomenon. The connection with the East Group Beakers of Únětice had intensified considerably in LN II, thus triggering a new social transformation and innovations in metallurgy that would announce the actual beginning of the Northern Bronze Age.|$|E

60|$|Concluding Remarks.--In {{comparing}} the capitulum of the hermaphrodite {{with that of}} the complemental male (Pl. VI, figs. 6 and 3), we must be struck with the differences in their shape, in the number, relative sizes, and forms of the several valves. It should, however, be borne in mind, that the scuta and carina in the hermaphrodite at first grow exclusively downwards; so that if we remove the upper portions subsequently added, the difference in shape in these valves is not so great as it at first appears. The rostrum in the male is of much larger relative size; whilst of the upper latera there is not a trace, although in the hermaphrodite these valves are larger than the rostrum. The terga, compared with those of the hermaphrodite, differ more essentially than do the other valves; {{and the manner in which}} the primordial valves project, shows that from the first commencement of calcification, the lines of growth have followed an unusual course. The great breadth and shortness of the terga is <b>evidently</b> <b>related</b> to the shortening of the whole capitulum, and the transverse position of the orifice; and this shortening of the capitulum, no doubt, is rendered necessary for its reception and protection within the shallow furrow between the scuta of the hermaphrodite. Finally, if we compare the internal parts of the hermaphrodite and male, the differences are considerable, though partly to be accounted for by the youth of the latter: the form and position of the labrum, and the distance between the first and second pair of cirri, is the same in both; but the mandibles and maxillæ differ considerably.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{preliminary}} study ms {{made with the}} objective of examining nitrogen species transformations of treated sewage effluent releases within the channel of an ephemeral stream, the Santa Cruz River of southern Arizona. Water quality samples were taken at established locations in sequence so that peak daily flows could be traced as the effluent moved downstream. Results indicate that increased nitrifica-tion, coinciding with changing stream characteristics, starts in the vicinity of Cortaro Road (6. 3 river miles from the Tucson Sewage Treat-ment Plant discharge). Through physical- chemical changes in streamflow, nitrate-nitrogen values reach a maximum at approximately 90 - 95 percent and 60 - 80 percent of total flow distance for low flows and high flows, respectively. Concentrations of ammonia-nitrogen and total nitrogen decrease continuously downstream with both high and low flows. There-fore, the rate of nitrification within sewage effluent releases in a desert stream channel <b>evidently</b> is <b>related</b> to flow distance and physical characteristics of the stream...|$|R

The authors first studied these features at Makapansgat (fig. 1) some fifteen years ago and have since then become aware of their very widespread occurrence in soluble rocks in many parts of the world. All subsequent information has served to confirm the origin of these features, but, since these were never published, it is worthwhile to place these findings on record. Solution cavities, or Makondos, in the Transvaal cave breccias are soil-filled pits shaped like an inverted cone. Their walls and intervening areas of the calcified cave deposit are usually rough, and the coalescing of adjacent cavities below the surface is common.

40|$|The high-cadence, {{comprehensive}} view of {{the solar}} corona by SDO/AIA shows many events that are widely separated in space while occurring close together in time. In some cases, sets of coronal events are <b>evidently</b> causally <b>related,</b> while in many other instances indirect evidence can be found. We present case studies to highlight a variety of coupling processes involved in coronal events. We find that physical linkages between events do occur, but concur with earlier studies that these couplings appear to be crucial to understanding the initiation of major eruptive or explosive phenomena relatively infrequently. We note that the post-eruption reconfiguration time scale of the large-scale corona, estimated from the EUV afterglow, is on average longer than the mean time between CMEs, so that many CMEs originate from a corona that is still adjusting from a previous event. We argue that the coronal field is intrinsically global: current systems build up over days to months, the relaxation after eruptions continues over many hours, and evolving connections easily span much of a hemisphere. This needs to be reflected in our modeling of the connections from the solar surface into the heliosphere to properly model the solar wind, its perturbations, and the generation and propagation of solar energetic particles. However, the large-scale field cannot be constructed reliably by currently available observational resources. We assess the potential of high-quality observations from beyond Earth's perspective and advanced global modeling to understand the couplings between coronal events {{in the context of}} CMEs and solar energetic particle events.
