500|$|A simple form of {{directional}} coupler is two parallel transmission lines coupled together over a λ/4 length. [...] This design is limited because the <b>electrical</b> <b>length</b> of the coupler {{will only be}} λ/4 at one specific frequency. [...] Coupling will be a maximum at this frequency and fall away on either side. [...] Similar to the impedance matching case, this can be improved by using multiple elements, resulting in a filter-like structure. [...] A waveguide analogue of this coupled lines approach is the Bethe-hole {{directional coupler}} in which two parallel waveguides are stacked {{on top of each}} other and a hole provided for coupling. [...] To produce a wideband design, multiple holes are used along the guides [...] as shown in figure 14 and a filter design applied. [...] It is not only the coupled-line design that suffers from being narrow band, all simple designs of waveguide coupler depend on frequency in some way. [...] For instance the rat-race coupler (which can be implemented directly in waveguide) works on a completely different principle but still relies on certain lengths being exact in terms of λ.|$|E
500|$|In {{some cases}} it is {{possible}} to continue using a topological network diagram even when components needing a distributed element analysis are present.

[...] Another way of dealing with distributed elements is to use a finite element analysis whereaby the distributed element is approximated by a large number of small lumped elements. [...] Just such an approach was used in one paper to model the cochlea of the human ear. [...] Another condition required of electrical systems for the application of the lumped element model is that no significant fields exist outside the component since these can couple to other unrelated components. [...] However, these effects can often be modelled by introducing some virtual lumped elements called strays or parasitics. [...] An analog of this in mechanical systems is vibration in one component being coupled to an unrelated component.|$|E

A general procedure to design a composite right/left-handed unit cell is presented. The procedure was used on a specific coupled line configuration, which is the coupled microstrip lines with slotted ground.

Moreover, with accurate slotted ground design, equal even and odd <b>electrical</b> <b>lengths</b> can be achieved.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} radar target {{recognition}} algorithm {{based on a}} feature set extracted from the target characteristic polarization states (CPS) and evaluated at a set of target resonant frequencies in the frequency domain. The algorithm involves measuring the proximity between training (stored) prototypes and a test prototype. For this task, the algorithm implements the nearest neighbour (NN) algorithm at each resonance to give a vote, and then the majority resonance vote is used to identify the test target prototype. The approach begins by using the power optimization procedure of the Kennaugh power matrix at a set of resonant frequencies to derive a series of CPS (expressed in normalized Stokes vector form) together with their associated receiver power levels. Then, certain CPS are selected and weighted by their associated power levels to create the feature set.
