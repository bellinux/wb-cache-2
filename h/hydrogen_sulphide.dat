40|$|Anoxia {{has been}} {{successfully}} induced in four benthic chambers installed on the Northern Adriatic seafloor from 1 week to 10 months. To accurately determine whether benthic foraminifera can survive experimentally induced prolonged anoxia, the CellTrackerGreen method has been applied. Numerous individuals have been found living at all sampling times and at all sampling depths, showing that benthic foraminifera can survive up to 10 months of anoxia with co-occurring <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphides.</b> However, foraminiferal standing stocks decrease with sampling time in an irregular way. A large difference in standing stock between two cores samples in initial conditions indicates {{the presence of a}} large spatial heterogeneity of the foraminiferal faunas. An unexpected increase in standing stocks after 1 month is tentatively interpreted as a reaction to increased food availability due to the massive mortality of infaunal macrofaunal organisms. After this, standing stocks decrease again in a core sampled after 2 months of anoxia, to attain a minimum in the cores sampled after 10 months. We speculate that the trend of overall decrease of standing stocks is not due to the adverse effects of anoxia and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphides,</b> but rather due to a continuous diminution of labile organic matter...|$|R

This study outlines a preliminary investigation into the suitability of natural CO 2 vents near White Island, Bay of Plenty, New Zealand (37831. 190 S, 117810. 850 E) for climate change research by characterising water chemistry from two vent and three control locations on a seasonal basis, as well as examining their effects on skeletons of the local calcifying crustose coralline algae. pH measurements at vent sites, calculated from dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity, showed reduced mean pH levels (7. 49 and 7. 85) relative to background levels of 8. 06, whereas mean temperatures were between 0. 0 and 0. 48 C above control. Increases in sulfur and mercury at sites near White Island were probably a result of volcanic unrest. Crustose coralline algae did not show significant variability in skeletal Mg-calcite geochemistry, but qualitative comparisons of calcite skeletons under scanning electron microscopy saw greater deformation and dissolution in coralline algae calcite crystals from vent sites compared to controls. Although additional monitoring of pH fluctuations and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphides</b> is still needed, the low pH and increased temperatures indicate potential for studying multistressor effects of projected climate changes in a natural environment...|$|R

Evidence of whale falls in present-day and fossil records shows that deep sea whale falls support a rich assemblage of creatures, with a global diversity of 407 species, comparable to other neritic biodiversity hotspots, such as cold seeps and hydrothermal vents. Deterioration of whale carcasses happens though {{a series of three}} stages. Initially, moving organisms, such as sharks and hagfish, scavenge soft tissue at a rapid rate over a period of months to as long as two years. This is followed by the colonization of bones and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as crustaceans and polychaetes, throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> enabling the growth of chemoautotrophic organisms, which in turn, support other organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets, and sea snails. This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 species per site.|$|E

While detailed studies in most regions of the world remain scarce, available data suggests that sulphide spring faunas are characterised by low species richness. Dipterans (among macroinvertebrates) and cyprinodontiforms (among fishes) appear to dominate the communities in these habitats. At least in fish, there is evidence for {{the presence}} of highly endemic species and populations exclusively inhabiting sulphide springs.

40|$|The {{hydrogen}} embrittlement of two HSLA steels was studied in conditions {{typical of the}} marine environment. Double cantilever beam specimens, heat treated to produce the microstructure in the heat affected zone of a weld, were tested in seawater containing sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) over a range of cathodic protection (CP) potentials and the threshold stress intensities ([Threshold Stress Intensity]) were recorded. The hydrogen concentration absorbed by the steel ([Surface Hydrogen Concentration]) was measured and shown to be higher at more negative CP potentials and significantly increased when SRB were present. An inverse relationship was established between log [Threshold Stress Intensity] and ([Surface Hydrogen Concentration]. It was concluded that crack propagation occurs by a single mechanism whether or not SRB are present. Three point bend specimens of both steels were machined from welded plate. Corrosion fatigue tests were carried out in seawater with and without SRB. The presence of active SRB caused increased crack growth rates.

40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} and diminishing petroleum reserves {{have increased the}} importance of biofuels for traffic fuel applications. Second generation biofuels produced from wood, vegetable oils and animal fats have been considered promising for delivering biofuels in large amount with low production cost. The abundance of oxygen {{in the form of}} various aliphatic and aromatic oxygenates decreases the quality of biofuels, however, and therefore the oxygen content of biofuels must be reduced. Upgrading of biofuels can be achieved by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), which is similar to hydrodesulphurisation in oil refining. In HDO, oxygen-containing compounds are converted to hydrocarbons by eliminating oxygen in the form of water in the presence of <b>hydrogen</b> and a <b>sulphided</b> catalyst. Due to the low sulphur content of biofuels, a sulphiding agent is typically added to the HDO feed to maintain activity and stability of the catalyst. The aim of this work was to investigate HDO using aliphatic and aromatic oxygenates as model compounds on sulphided NiMo/γ-Al 2 O 3 and CoMo/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalysts. The effects of side product, water, and of sulphiding agents, H 2 S and CS 2, on HDO were determined. The primary focus was on the HDO of aliphatic oxygenates, because a reasonable amount of data regarding the HDO of aromatic oxygenates already exists. The HDO of aliphatic esters produced hydrocarbons from intermediate alcohol, carboxylic acid, aldehyde and ether compounds. A few sulphur-containing compounds were also detected in trace amounts, and their formation caused desulphurisation of the catalysts. Hydrogenation reactions and acid-catalysed reactions (dehydration, hydrolysis, esterification, E 2 elimination and SN 2 nucleophilic substitution) {{played a major role in}} the HDO of aliphatic oxygenates. The NiMo catalyst showed a higher activity for HDO and hydrogenation reactions than the CoMo catalyst, but both catalysts became deactivated because of desulphurisation and coking. Water inhibited the HDO, but the addition of H 2 S effectively eliminated the inhibition. The addition of H 2 S enhanced HDO and stabilised the selectivities but did not prevent deactivation of the catalysts. The effect of H 2 S was explained in terms of promotion of the acid-catalysed reactions due to enhanced catalyst acidity. Water and the sulphiding agents added to the HDO feed suppressed hydrogenation reactions on the NiMo catalyst but did not affect them on the CoMo catalyst. The addition of H 2 S resulted in less hydrogen consumption and coke formation than the addition of CS 2, but the product distribution was shifted such that the carbon efficiency decreased. It was concluded that, for the HDO of aliphatic oxygenates, H 2 S was superior to CS 2 as a sulphiding agent. The HDO of phenol, used as a model aromatic oxygenate, produced aromatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons in parallel routes in which the primary reactions were direct hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation, respectively. The addition of H 2 S on both catalysts inhibited the HDO due to competitive adsorption of phenol and H 2 S, and affected the hydrogenation reactions in the same way as in the HDO of aliphatic oxygenates. The opposite effects of H 2 S on the HDO of aliphatic and aromatic oxygenates were attributed to the different reaction mechanisms for oxygen elimination (dehydration, hydrolysis, elimination and direct hydrogenolysis reactions). The different molecular and electronic structures of the aliphatic and aromatic oxygenates are likely the reason for the different reaction mechanisms. Under the identical conditions, phenol was less reactive than aliphatic oxygenates on the sulphided catalysts. In contrast to the situation in the HDO of aliphatic oxygenates, the NiMo catalyst was less active for the HDO of phenol than was the CoMo catalyst. This work illustrates that the composition of biofuels determines the overall performance of the HDO process and the effect of sulphiding agent on the HDO. The HDO performance may be lower for wood-based biofuels, which contain mainly aromatic oxygenates, than for vegetable oils and animal fats, which contain aliphatic oxygenates. This conclusion further implies that operating conditions in an industrial process need to be more severe for upgrading of wood-based biofuels than upgrading of vegetable oils and animal fats. The addition of a sulphiding agent to the HDO feed will probably affect the total HDO of wood-based biofuels negatively and that of vegetable oils and animal fats positively. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} carbonyl sulphide as a new fumigant and related methodology studies. The first part involved the investigation of a new fumigant - carbonyl sulphide, which {{has the potential to}} replace methyl bromide. Its biological response or activity was investigated, e. g. toxicity to target organisms and phytotoxicity, environmental and worker safety considerations. In the second investigation, analytical methods were developed for the determination of fumigant movement through timber and fumigant residues in grains as well as a method of chemical fractionation to determine the fate of carbonyl sulphide. A comprehensive literature review of 161 references in these two areas is reported. Carbonyl sulphide was highly toxic to adults of three coleopteran species tested, namely Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), Tribolium confusum du Val, and Sitophilus oryzae (L.), the most sensitive species was R. dominica. For 6 hr exposure at 25 ?C, the L(CxT) 95 value for R. dominica, S. oryzae and T. confusum were, respectively, 36. 48, 99. 82 and 113. 0 mg h L- 1. Carbonyl sulphide inhibited 100 % of mould in wet wheat and more than 90 % of mould on dry wheat at lOOmg L- 1. Both carbonyl <b>sulphide</b> and <b>hydrogen</b> cyanide were low in phytotoxicity without affecting germination of wheat, at levels needed to control insects. Unlike <b>hydrogen</b> cyanide, carbonyl <b>sulphide</b> can be used at minimum levels without decreasing plumule length of wheat. Chemical data on the sorption of carbonyl sulphide are compared with data from methyl bromide. The levels of carbonyl sulphide in the headspace of five commodities (wheat, barley, paddy, sorghum and peanut) and timbers (hardwood and softwood) decay more slowly than do levels of methyl bromide. Carbonyl sulphide was blown through a column of wheat as easily as was phosphine and more easily than was methyl bromide, and its front was blown out faster than phosphine and methyl bromide. Movement of two fumigants (methyl bromide and carbonyl sulphide) through, and sorption on, softwood and hardwood were studied. Each fumigant was sorbed less on softwood than on hardwood and penetrated softwood better than hardwood. Carbonyl sulphide penetrated timber better than did methyl bromide, and was less sorbed on timber. A rapid method of solvent extraction was developed to enable rapid estimation of the amount on intact fumigant sorbed in wood. This procedure enabled near quantitative recovery of methyl bromide as either intact fumigant or as bromide ion. Carbonyl sulphide residue in unfumigated wheat was found to be around 25 - SOppb. Carbonyl sulphide left little residue on fumigated grains. Desorption of carbonyl sulphide from the wheat was extremely fast, 85 % of it was released after one day aeration which was very much greater than that of methyl bromide and carbon disulphide. After 6 days aeration the incorporation of 14 COS on mungbean, wheat, paddy, rice and safflower was lower than 7 Oppb (calculated as COS equivalent). Food value or nutritional quality of foodstuffs is not harmed by carbonyl sulphide fumigation. This result was assessed by identifying any nonreversible change or combined residues in biochemical fractions of commodities including lipids, protein, amino acids, carbohydrate, etc., and no irreversible reaction between carbonyl sulphide and any constituent such as B vitamin, atocopherol, lysine, maltose and starch. Fumigants did not affect lipids, although each fumigant was applied to wheat at exaggerated concentrations, nor wheat germ oil and canola oil treated with extremely high concentration of fumigants. Factors which affect analysis of fumigants including stability of chemicals in extraction solvent and partitioning of fumigant between solvent and air, were examined. The partition ratio, defined as the fumigant concentration in extraction solvent to that in the headspace, varied with fumigant. Methods for multi-fumigant analysis were developed or modified and gave high recoveries and efficiency. The procedure of Daft of solvent extraction followed by partitioning was modified by being performed in sealed flasks. This raised the recovery of carbonyl sulphide, methyl bromide, phosphine and carbon disulphide. Recoveries were near quantitative at levels down to 6 - 16 ppb (w/w) for tested fumigants. Thus the modified Daft method can be adapted to enable determination of the main fumigants used on staple foodstuffs. Microwave irradiation method give higher efficiency of removal of fumigants from grains. Limits of quantification were < 0. 2 ng g- 1 (ppb w/w) for each tested fumigant. The detection limit of COS was calculated, as natural levels of the fumigant were detected in commodities. These are feasible, simple and rapid (< 2 min.) to be use to analyse fumigant residue in grains. Carbonyl sulphide has potential as a fumigant for grain and timber and may replace methyl bromide in some uses, subject to further investigation in commercial situations...|$|R

At the Pickering treatment plant raw gas was routed through a slug catcher and inlet separator to remove liquid hydrocarbons and water. Gas flowed to two parallel vetrocoke absorbers where it was washed with a counter-current aqueous solution of soda ash and arsenic compounds to convert the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> to elemental sulphur. Gas then flowed to a hydrocarbon recovery unit where it was chilled to remove further liquid hydrocarbons, the dry sulphur-free gas passed through a British Gas metering station to Feeder No. 6 of the National Transmission System which passes through Pickering. The sulphur-rich solution from the absorbers was routed to oxidiser regenerators where air was bubbled through the solution to remove the sulphur {{in the form of}} a froth. The froth was dried in a rotary vacuum filter and heated in an autoclave to allow removal of impurities prior to being stored in tanks at about 130°C from where it was removed by heated road tanker. The regenerated absorber solution from the oxidisers, together with recovered solution from the vacuum filters, was returned for reuse in the vetrocoke absorbers. Hydrocarbon liquids were routed to condensate stabilizers and then to storage tanks for removal by road tanker.|$|E
500|$|The first {{noticeable}} {{indications of}} volcanic activity were recorded at the seismic station in Kirkjubæjarklaustur, Iceland from 6 to 8 November, which detected weak tremors emanating from an epicentre approximately west-south-west {{at a distance}} of , the location of Surtsey. Another station in Reykjavík recorded even weaker tremors for ten hours on 12 November at an undetermined location, when seismic activity ceased until 21 November. That same day, people in the coastal town of Vík [...] away noticed a smell of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide.</b> On 13 November, a fishing vessel in search of herring, equipped with sensitive thermometers, noted sea temperatures [...] SW of the eruption center were [...] higher than surrounding waters.|$|E
500|$|Gastrotrichs are {{cosmopolitan}} in distribution. They {{inhabit the}} interstitial spaces between particles in marine and freshwater environments, {{the surfaces of}} aquatic plants and other submerged objects and the surface film of water surrounding soil particles on land. They are also found in stagnant pools and anaerobic mud, where they thrive even {{in the presence of}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide.</b> When pools dry up they can survive periods of desiccation as eggs, and some species are capable of forming cysts in harsh conditions. [...] In marine sediments they have been known to reach 364 individuals per [...] making them the third most common invertebrate in the sediment after nematodes and harpacticoid copepods. In freshwater they may reach a density of 158 individuals per [...] and are the fifth most abundant group of invertebrates in the sediment.|$|E
500|$|There are {{typically}} 40 million bacterial cells in {{a gram of}} soil and a million bacterial cells in a millilitre of fresh water. There are approximately 5×1030 bacteria on Earth, forming a biomass which exceeds that of all plants and animals. Bacteria are vital in many stages of the nutrient cycle by recycling nutrients such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere. The nutrient cycle includes the decomposition of dead bodies and bacteria {{are responsible for the}} putrefaction stage in this process. In the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, extremophile bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds, such as <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> and methane, to energy. In March 2013, data reported by researchers in October 2012, was published. It was suggested that bacteria thrive in the Mariana Trench, which with a depth of up to 11 kilometres is the deepest known part of the oceans. Other researchers reported related studies that microbes thrive inside rocks up to 580 metres below the sea floor under 2.6 kilometres of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States. According to one of the researchers, [...] "You can find microbes everywhere—they're extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} taking <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> {{out of a}} gas stream is called [...] "{{sweetening}}" [...] the gas. The Union Gas Company of Toronto built Canada's first sweetening plant in 1924 at Port Alma, Ontario, to scrub Tillbury gas. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> is a dangerous substance which at low concentrations has an obnoxious rotten egg smell. This odour annoyed Union's customers and prompted it to build the Port Alma plant. It removed <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> by exposing the sour gas to dissolved soda ash. Although previously used on coal gas, the application at the Port Alma plant {{was the first time}} this process sweetened natural gas.|$|E
