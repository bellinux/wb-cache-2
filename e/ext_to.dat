Each language, an instantiation of LC, consists of a generative procedure that yields a discrete infinity of hierarchically structured expressions with semantic interpretations, hence a kind of “language of thought” (LOT), along with an operation of externalization (<b>EXT)</b> <b>to</b> some sensory-motor system, typically sound. There is mounting evidence that generation of LOT observes language-independent principles of computational efficiency {{and is based on}} the simplest computational operations, and that EXT is an ancillary process not entering into the core semantic properties of LOT and is the primary locus of the apparent complexity, diversity, and mutability of language. These conclusions are not surprising, since the internal system is acquired virtually without evidence in fundamental respects, and EXT relates it to sensory-motor systems that are unrelated to it. Even such properties as the linear order of words appear to be reflexes of the sensory motor system, not available to generation of LOT.

No complications occurred related to ExT. Using a discriminant analysis, a statistical model was established in the first 72 patients (learning group) and validated in the next 45 patients (testing group). Baseline variables were comparable in terms of age (56 yrs vs 59 yrs), Q-wave AMI (83 % vs 76 %), inferior AMI (65 % vs 69 %), use of thrombolytic therapy (64 % vs 60 %) and MVD (44 % vs 36 %). Of 9 clinical and 15 exercise variables which were incorporated in the discriminant analysis, the number of METs achieved (p < 0. 0005), maximal ST segment depression in V 5 (p < 0. 0051 and maximal exercise heart rate were the only variables significantly associated with the presence of MVD in the learning group. The discriminant function, using these 3 variables, correctly classified 75 % of patients with MVD in the learning group and 79 % of patients in the testing group, whereas the use of maximal ST depression alone, the most conventional index, correctly classified only 60 % of patients in the testing group (p < 0. 005).
