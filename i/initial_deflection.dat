40|$|A {{nonlinear}} coupled {{dynamic model}} of a rod fastening rotor under rub-impact and <b>initial</b> permanent <b>deflection</b> was developed in this paper. The governing motion equation was derived by the D’Alembert principle considering the contact characteristic between disks, nonlinear oil-film force, rub-impact force, unbalance mass, etc. The contact effects between disks was modeled as a flexural spring with cubical nonlinear stiffness. The coupled nonlinear dynamic phenomena of the rub-impact rod fastening rotor bearing system with <b>initial</b> permanent <b>deflection</b> were investigated by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Bifurcation diagram, vibration waveform, frequency spectrum, shaft orbit and Poincaré map are used to illustrate the rich diversity of the system response with complicated dynamics. The studies indicate that the coupled dynamic responses of the rod fastening rotor bearing system under rub-impact and <b>initial</b> permanent <b>deflection</b> exhibit a rich nonlinear dynamic diversity, synchronous periodic- 1 motion, multiple periodic motion, quasi-periodic motion and chaotic motion can be observed under certain conditions. Larger radial stiffness of the stator will simplify the system motion and make the oil whirl weaker or even disappear at a certain rotating speed. With the increase of <b>initial</b> permanent <b>deflection</b> length, the instability speed of the system gradually rises, and the chaotic motion region gets smaller and smaller. The corresponding results can provide guidance for the fault diagnosis of a rub-impact rod fastening rotor with <b>initial</b> permanent <b>deflection</b> {{and contribute to the}} further understanding of the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the rod fastening rotor bearing system...|$|R
50|$|Prestin densely {{lines the}} lipid bilayer {{of the outer}} hair cell membranes. Therefore, {{a change in the}} shape of many prestin proteins, which tend to {{conglomerate}} together, will ultimately lead to a change in shape of the OHC. A lengthening of prestin lengthens the hair cell while prestin contraction leads to a decrease in OHC length. Because the OHC is tightly associated with the reticular lamina and the Deiter's cell, shape change of the OHC leads to movement of these upper and lower membranes, causing changes in vibrations detected in the cochlear partition. Upon <b>initial</b> <b>deflection</b> of the BM causing positive hair bundle deflection, the reticular lamina is pushed downward, resulting in a negative deflection of the hair bundles. This causes stereocilia channel closing which leads to hyperpolarization and OHC elongation.|$|E
50|$|As well as {{combinations}} of which whiskers have been stimulated, neurons may also respond to {{specific types of}} whisker stimulation. The simplest response, seen in neurons within the layer IV barrel cortex, directly code for whisker displacement. That is to say, that the neuron within a given barrel will fire when the whisker that barrel represents is moved {{at a rate that}} is roughly proportional to the angular displacement of the neuron. These neurons also show directional sensitivity; certain neurons will only fire when the whisker is moved in a specific direction. Deflection-based firing neurons can sustain their response throughout the deflection of the whisker. Other neurons respond to the <b>initial</b> <b>deflection,</b> but then quickly return to their previous level of activity. Much of this activity is also modulated by the behaviour of the animal - rats and mice actively move their whiskers to explore their environment, and the response of a neuron to a particular stimulus can vary depending on what the animal is doing.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation is to determine theoretically the effective length factors of cross-braced solid round diagonals in all-welded steel communication towers. Three beam-column models with different boundary conditions (pinned, elastically restrained, and fixed) were investigated and it was shown that a beam-column with elastic restraints at ends and at cross-brace location is the most accurate. However, for design purposes, when {{the ratio of the}} diameter of the leg to the diameter of the diagonal exceeds three, beam-column model with fixed ends and elastic restraint at cross-brace location is satisfactory. The theoretical results were compared with results of tests on 26 specimens. Based on small deflections and elastic behavior, theoretical equations were developed for symmetric and anti-symmetric deflection modes. It was shown that during initial stages of loading, symmetric deflection mode will dominate while anti-symmetric deflection mode will dominate at failure and ultimately, the failure is in anti-symmetric mode. The theoretical results were again compared with tests carried out on 26 specimens. Finally, finite element analysis was carried out on one tower for the following six cases: (a) elastic stage with symmetric <b>initial</b> <b>deflection,</b> (b) elastic stage with anti-symmetric <b>initial</b> <b>deflection,</b> (c) elastic stage with superposition of symmetric and anti-symmetric <b>initial</b> <b>deflection,</b> (d) elastic-plastic stage with symmetric <b>initial</b> <b>deflection,</b> (e) elastic-plastic stage with anti-symmetric <b>initial</b> <b>deflection,</b> and (f) elastic-plastic stage with superposition of symmetric and anti-symmetric <b>initial</b> <b>deflection.</b> The effect of the magnitude of anti-symmetric deflection was studied for three towers.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the design}} of {{mechanisms}} with elastic joints, leaf-springs are often used. These have a large in-plane stiffness and a relatively small out-of-plane stiffness, which allows {{the design of}} elastic joints with a large stiffness in some directions, called the support stiffness, and a small stiffness in the complementary directions in which motion is desired, called the drive stiffness. Examples are a parallel leaf-spring guidance as an approximation for a prismatic joint and a cross-spring pivot as an approximation for a revolute joint. The support stiffness decreases when a joint is deflected from its central position. Also imperfections in the leaf-springs {{due to lack of}} flatness or assembly misalignments can have this effect. Residual stresses mainly influence the torsional rigidity of leaf-springs, whereas the influence on the flexural rigidity is non-linear and becomes important near the stability limit. <b>Initial</b> <b>deflections</b> of the order of the thickness of the leaf-springs can already have a significant influence on the support stiffness in the central position...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{temperature}} and acoustic loading {{are included in}} a theoretical finite element large deflection formulation for thin, isotropic beams. Thermal loads are applied as steady-state temperature distributions, and acoustic loads are taken to be ergodic and Gaussian with zero mean and uniform magnitude and phase {{along the length of}} the beam. Material properties are considered presently to be independent of temperature. Also, inplane and rotary inertia terms are assumed to be negligible, and all inplane edge conditions are taken to be immovable. For the random response analysis, both auto- and cross-correlation terms are included. The nature of the loads leads to the solution of two separate problems. First, the problem of thermal postbuckling is solved to determine the deflections and stresses due to the thermal load only.

It is found that the <b>initial</b> buckling <b>deflection</b> with one half-wave, occurring near the impacted end, develops into the higher post-buckling mode with several half-waves, as the axial compression waves propagate forward. The numerical results show that no strain reversal occurs at the early stage of post-buckling process, and the solution corresponding to the tangent-modulus theory is valid for the dynamic plastic post-buckling response of the bar at this stage.
