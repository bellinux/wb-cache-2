60|$|The {{manner in}} which the fuse was {{attached}} to the bomb was simple. The hole made in the bomb was exactly the size of the <b>fuse</b> <b>inserted</b> into it. There were two little knobs, one on each side the hole. After pushing the fuse into the hole a fine wire was wound around it and attached to the tiny knobs, thus holding it firmly in place.|$|R
50|$|Plugs {{often include}} a pilot light LED {{indicator}} {{to indicate that}} electrical power is connected. Optionally, the plug may be equipped with an internal fuse for electrical safety, usually rated at 10 amps or less. In some designs, {{the tip of the}} plug may be unscrewed to reveal a cylindrical glass fuse; other variants may use a newer blade-type <b>fuse</b> <b>inserted</b> into the side or back of the plug.|$|R
60|$|The {{barrels of}} gun cotton were now hastily {{opened on the}} bank, and men waded out with the {{contents}}. Lieutenant Ribouville upon one side, and Ralph upon the other, took the cotton and thrust it, with long sticks, into {{the ends of the}} hole. In five minutes the contents of the two barrels were safely lodged, the <b>fuse</b> <b>inserted,</b> and the operation of tamping--or ramming--in dry sand, earth, and stones commenced.|$|R
50|$|On 17 April 1945, {{near the}} end of the Second World War, a 57 Squadron Lancaster was being loaded with bombs when a fully armed 1,000 lb bomb was unintentionally dropped onto the tarmac. Because the bomb had had its <b>fuse</b> <b>inserted</b> it detonated, setting off the rest of the Lancaster's bombload. A massive {{explosion}} killed three airmen, injured 16 others, wrote off six other Lancasters beyond repair and badly damaged a nearby aircraft hangar.|$|R
60|$|The {{storekeeper}} nodded when {{at length}} Weston carefully clamped down a big copper cap on {{a length of}} snaky <b>fuse</b> and <b>inserted</b> it in another hole.|$|R
50|$|The {{oldest and}} {{simplest}} type of cap, fuse caps are a metal cylinder, closed at one end. From the open end inwards, there is first an empty space into which a pyrotechnic <b>fuse</b> is <b>inserted</b> and crimped, then a pyrotechnic ignition mix, a primary explosive, {{and then the}} main detonating explosive charge.|$|R
50|$|When {{used as a}} {{stake mine}} the mine is {{inverted}} and an MUV type pull <b>fuse</b> is <b>inserted</b> into {{the base of the}} mine, and the normal pressure fuse hole is used to attach the mine to the stake. When used with the fragmentation jacket the mine has a lethal radius of 15 metres, although the fragments may be lethal at greater range.|$|R
40|$|Here we {{show that}} cells expressing genes {{inserted}} into Semliki Forest virus (SFV) vectors generate a large fraction of defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) due to frequent initiation on downstream Met residues. In monopolizing the host cell translational machinery, SFV reduces levels of translation eukaryotic initiation factor 4 E (eIF 4 E), diminishes phosphorylation of ribosome subunit S 6, and phosphorylates translation initiation factor eIF 2 α. We show that the last event is required for SFV mistranslation of inserted genes. Downstream initiation is suppressed by <b>fusing</b> <b>inserted</b> genes with the open reading frame encoding the SFV capsid, demonstrating that one function of the capsid element is to enable ribosomes to initiate translation in the proper location. These results show that in modifying translation, viral vectors can unpredictably increase the generation of truncated polypeptides and thereby the DRiP fraction of inserted gene products, which can potentially affect their yield, therapeutic efficacy, and immunogenicity...|$|R
5000|$|Until the mid-1980s, firecracker {{production}} was low-tech. They were handmade, beginning with rolling tubes. Once the firecracker tubes were rolled by hand (commonly from newspaper) and labelled, and then filled with powder, their ends were crimped and <b>fuses</b> <b>inserted,</b> all by hand. These finished firecrackers were usually braided into [...] "strings" [...] {{and sold in}} packs which came in many sizes, from the very small ("penny packs" [...] containing as few as four to six firecrackers) to the most common size packs (containing 16 and 20 crackers per pack), to larger packs (containing 24, 30, 32, 40, 50, 60, 72, 90, 100, and 120 firecrackers), to huge [...] "belts" [...] and [...] "rolls" [...] (packages containing strings of several hundred to several thousand crackers—Phantom Fireworks sells rolls as large as 16,000 firecrackers). Firecracker packages were wrapped in colourful and translucent glassine paper, as well as clear cellophane, with glassine the most popular.|$|R
60|$|Every day, {{since the}} siege had begun, the {{defenders}} had fired an occasional {{shot at the}} stockade; not with any idea of doing any damage, but in order that the assailants should {{know that they were}} still in the cavern. That evening, when the hole had got to the proper depth, Stanley, having prepared his fuse, went up with twenty cartridges in his pocket, accompanied by Meinik. The hole was charged and tamped, and the <b>fuse</b> <b>inserted.</b> This took a considerable time. The fuse had been cut so that an inch of it projected outside the hole. The other eight cartridges were then broken up, and the powder moistened; and a train some two feet long laid, from the fuse towards the entrance of the hole. Then a piece of rag was wrapped round one end of the ramrod; and this, again, was tied to a long rod that had, the night before, been cut by one of the boys, who had slipped out noiselessly from the entrance. The rag had been moistened, and rubbed with gunpowder.|$|R
50|$|The bomb {{is usually}} a short section of steel water pipe {{containing}} the explosive mixture and closed at both ends with steel or brass caps. A <b>fuse</b> is <b>inserted</b> into the pipe with a lead running out {{through a hole in}} the side or capped end of the pipe. The fuse can be electric, with wires leading to a timer and battery, or can be a common fuse. All of the components are easily obtainable.|$|R
50|$|In some jurisdictions, {{replacement}} of the fuse cartridge by unskilled personnel is allowed only for fuses {{up to a certain}} maximum rating. If the <b>fuse</b> cartridge is <b>inserted</b> into the socket without the cap, a shock hazard exists.|$|R
5000|$|The mine has {{circular}} {{metal case}} inside {{which is the}} doughnut shaped main charge. In the centre of which the <b>fuse</b> is <b>inserted.</b> On top of the mine is a metal pressure grid. The grid is {{held in place by}} thin metal wall. Sufficient pressure on the grid causes the wall to collapse sideways, allowing the grid to press down on a plunger triggering 3.5 oz (0.1 kg) Toul (Tetryl) [...] booster charge, detonating the mine.|$|R
50|$|James Dyer Ball, in {{his book}} Things Chinese, has a {{detailed}} description about the process and material used for making firecrackers {{at the end of}} the 19th century. At that time, firecrackers were made by female and child workers, using straw paper to make the body of the firecracker, while the fuse was made of bamboo paper imported from Japan, then stiffened with buckwheat paste. The bamboo paper was cut into strips of 14 in long and 1/3 in wide, laid on a table; a string of gunpowder was placed at the center with a hollow tube, then twisted up to make a piece of fuse. The firecracker tubes were made from pieces of straw paper wrapped around iron rods of various diameters and then tightened with a special tool. 200 to 300 firecrackers were tied up in a bunch, then red clay was spread at the bottom of the bunch and forced into each end of the firecracker with a punch; gunpowder was poured in, then the other end was sealed with an awl by turning the tube inward, and a <b>fuse</b> <b>inserted.</b>|$|R
40|$|Locally induced {{expression}} of a highly anionic peroxidase has previously been correlated temporally and spatially with suberization of tissues responding to pathogen assault, wounding, or exogenously applied abscisic acid or fungal elicitors. DNA sequences corresponding to the 5 [prime] regions of two tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) genes encoding homologous anionic peroxidases were <b>fused,</b> <b>inserted</b> into a pTi-based plasmid designed to express a composite antisense transcript, and introduced into tomato via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. RNA gel-blot analyses showed high {{expression of}} the antisense transcript in most transgenic plants and no detectable induction of native anionic peroxidase transcripts in wounded or abscisic acid or pathogen-treated tissues. Plants and fruits expressing the antisense transcript appeared normal in all respects. Electrophoretic analysis of anionic proteins from selected transgenic plants showed no detectable anionic peroxidase protein or activity. Depolymerization of polymeric material from the wound periderm of transgenic tomato fruits {{and analysis of the}} aliphatic products by gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry showed that the content and composition of C 16 /C 18 [omega]-hydroxy and dicarboxylic acids, characteristic of suberin, were not affected by the absence of the anionic peroxidase. Autofluorescence generated from cell wall phenolics at the wound lesion was also not affected by the absence of the highly anionic peroxidase...|$|R
50|$|A {{chocolate}} bomb is a firecracker {{which is}} exploded by revelers during Diwali and New Year's Eve celebrations in India. Chocolate bombs {{are made of}} tiny paperboard boxes stuffed with gunpowder. A <b>fuse</b> is <b>inserted</b> {{in one of the}} corners. The boxes are then tightly wrapped with jute strings and dried in the sun for three days. After that they are wrapped with colorful aluminum foil, making them resemble chocolates. The Burima brand of chocolate bombs were very popular in Kolkata in the 1990s. The firecracker has been declared illegal in West Bengal.|$|R
50|$|Just after 10 pm on Tuesday 5 December 1916, {{several hundred}} {{women and girls}} had just started their shift at the factory. Four and a half inch shells were being filled, fused, {{finished}} off and packed. Room 42 was mainly used for the filling, and around 170 girls worked there. Shells {{were brought to the}} room fully loaded, and all that was left to do was for the fuse to be added and the shell cap screwed down. The <b>fuse</b> was <b>inserted</b> by hand, then a machine screwed the fuse down tightly.|$|R
50|$|A typical cherry bomb {{contains}} {{a core of}} explosive composition (e.g., flash powder or, less commonly, black powder) which is generally encapsulated inside a paper cup, which is in turn most commonly surrounded by a layer (approx. one-quarter inch thick) of sawdust infused with a mild adhesive (usually sodium silicate). An ignition <b>fuse</b> is <b>inserted</b> into a hole drilled into the hardened sawdust sphere, {{all the way down}} to reach the explosive composition. The fuse extends outside the sphere approximately one to one and a half inches. Once the fuse is ignited, it takes about three to four and a half seconds to reach the explosive composition and initiate explosion of the firework.|$|R
50|$|Socks {{were long}} thin canvas bags of {{incendiary}} material each weighing about 6 lb. Socks were packed with wood wool, bound with wire and soaked in boiling paraffin wax. Each Outward balloon could carry three socks. The whole bundle measured about 27 x 10 x 10 in. When dropped, socks formed a Vshaped sausage designed to {{catch in the}} crown of a tree. <b>Fuses</b> were <b>inserted</b> in {{each end of the}} device and it would burn from each end for 15 minutes. In 1941 the Royal Navy had a stock of 10,000 such socks already fused and ready to be used and another 20,000 bodies that could be brought forward as required.|$|R
5000|$|About 380 {{women and}} girls worked in the plant's [...] "F" [...] Building. The company had placed {{newspaper}} ads specifically recruiting [...] "girls" [...] for the job. The building had three divisions: the pellet room, where girls made the black powder fuses that ran {{through the center of}} the shrapnel shells; the loading room, where the <b>fuses</b> were <b>inserted</b> and [...] "pocket cups" [...] at the bottom of the shells were filled with loose powder; and the inspection room, where the finished product was inspected. Normally only about thirty girls worked in the pellet room, but two weeks earlier the company had hired about seventy more to fill a large rush order that was due to be shipped in a few days.|$|R
50|$|The primary hazard of {{pyrotechnic}} {{blasting caps}} {{is that for}} proper usage, the <b>fuse</b> must be <b>inserted</b> and then crimped into place by crushing {{the base of the}} cap around the fuse. If the tool used to crimp the cap is used too close to the explosives, the primary explosive compound can detonate during crimping. A common hazardous practice is crimping caps with one's teeth; an accidental detonation can cause serious injury to the mouth.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{representations}} in {{the shape}} of 3 D triangle meshes of heterogeneous quality are readily generated using sensors such as laser scanners. We propose an algorithm to fuse two registered, i. e. aligned in rotation and translation, meshes while using only vertices contained in the input data. Mesh quality is determined for each input mesh depending on the assumed sensor model. In the first step, redundant faces are removed using local comparison of mesh quality. Finally, the meshes are <b>fused</b> by <b>inserting</b> new faces, using the remaining vertices, resulting in a mesh with locally optimal quality regarding both input datasets. Since no new vertices are introduced, further processing can rely on the original measurements and any associated meta data such as sensor specific information. Results are shown for fusing overlapping parts of datasets representing a ballroom and the Stanford Bunny...|$|R
5000|$|The No 7 Mk 1 Dingbat mine is a British anti-personnel blast mine. The mine has a steel body, with a {{flexible}} pressure pad {{on the top}} surface. Under the pressure pad is a belleville spring with a central striker. The fuse is slid {{into the side of}} the mine, a firing pin prevents the <b>fuse</b> being fully <b>inserted</b> until it is removed. The mine was intended to be scattered mechanically, and a number of systems were tested to scatter it. However, none were accepted into service, so the Dingbat mine was hand laid instead. The mine came with a small fabric cover to help hide it.|$|R
40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{demonstrated a}} high-order optical vortex pulsed laser {{based on a}} mode selective all-fiber fused coupler composed of a single-mode fiber (SMF) and a few-mode fiber (FMF). The <b>fused</b> SMF-FMF coupler <b>inserted</b> in the cavity not only acts as mode converter from LP 01 mode to LP 11 or LP 21 modes with a broadband width over 100 nm, but also directly delivers femtosecond vortex pulses out of the mode locked cavity. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first report on the generation of high-order pulse vortex beams in mode-locked fiber laser.

25|$|The {{process of}} somatic cell nuclear {{transplant}} involves two different cells. The first being a female gamete, {{known as the}} ovum (egg/oocyte). In human SCNT (Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer) experiments, these eggs are obtained through consenting donors, utilizing ovarian stimulation. The second being a somatic cell, referring to {{the cells of the}} human body. Skin cells, fat cells, and liver cells are only a few examples. The nucleus of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded, leaving it 'deprogrammed.' What is left is a somatic cell and an unnucleated egg cell. These are then <b>fused</b> by <b>inserting</b> the somatic cell into the 'empty' ovum. After being inserted into the egg, the somatic cell nucleus is reprogrammed by its host egg cell.

The egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all the necessary genetic information from just one parent. Development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions, this single cell forms a blastocyst (an early stage embryo with about 100 cells) with an identical genome to the original organism (i.e. a clone).

30|$|The primers {{used were}} {{summarized}} in Table S 1. Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 Rubisco genes were {{inserted into the}} NdeI/XhoI sites of pET 30 a, resulting plasmid 1. A second and a third T 7 promoters containing the ribosomal binding site (RBS) region were fused in the upstream of rbcX and rbcS, yielding plasmids 2 and 3, respectively. The trc promoter was synthesized by primer annealing and inserted in the XbaI site of plasmid 1 to yield plasmid 4. A second and third trc promoters were added similarly to generate plasmids 5 and 6. Synechococcuselongatus PCC 7942 phosphoribulokinase gene prk was inserted into the BglI/PshAI sites of plasmid 2. The promoter trpR-Ptrp was constructed by fusion of the TrpR repressor and the Ptrp promoter amplified from DH 5 α genomic DNA. The <b>fused</b> promoter was <b>inserted</b> into the FspI/BglI sites of prk-containing vector, yielding the selection plasmid. Overlapping PCR was used to introduce point mutations into the rbc or prk gene to constructed the corresponding mutants.|$|R

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{properties of}} three laboratory {{strains of the}} spleen focus-forming virus were compared. All strains contain genetic sequences related to the env gene of mink cell focus-inducing murine type C leukemia viruses, and each strain codes for a glycoprotein of 50, 000 to 52, 000 daltons which shares specific immunological properties with the gp 70 's of mink cell focus-inducing viruses. In contrast to this constancy, gag gene products coded for by these strains vary significantly. The gag and env gene products are synthesized from separate mRNA's, and the mRNA for the env gene product is approximately 18 S. Unlike other acute leukemia viruses, which can transform various undifferentiated cells, have large unique sequence cellular gene <b>inserts</b> <b>fused</b> to helper virus gag genes, and have one known genome-length intracellular mRNA, the spleen focus-forming virus transforms only specific hematopoietic stem cells, is an env gene rather than a gag gene recombinant virus, and has a second distinct and smaller class of intracellular mRNA. Our data therefore indicate that the Friend strain of the spleen focus-forming virus is a unique replication-defective acute leukemia virus...|$|R
40|$|The N-terminal {{region of}} the gene {{encoding}} polyhedrin, the major occlusion protein of the insect baculovirus Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV), has been fused to DNA encoding Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase. The <b>fused</b> gene was <b>inserted</b> into the AcNPV DNA genome by cotransfection of insect cells with recombinant plasmid DNA and wild-type AcNPV genomic DNA. Recombinant viruses were selected as blue plaques {{in the presence of}} a beta-galactosidase indicator, 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside. Studies of one such virus, L 1 GP-gal 3, indicated that the synthesis of beta-galactosidase is temporally controlled beginning late (20 h) in infection after the release of infectious virus particles from the cell. By 48 h postinfection, a remarkably high level of expression is achieved. On the basis of these results, AcNPV should be a useful vector for the stable propagation and expression of passenger genes in a lepidopteran cell background. A generalized transplacement vector that facilitates the construction and selection of recombinant viruses carrying passenger genes under their own promoter control has also been developed...|$|R
