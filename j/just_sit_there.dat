500|$|Greil Marcus {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} disregarding one's initial reading of the song. [...] "The first impression is that Bob Dylan is setting up the usual private scene: 'I'll sit here and watch the river flow.' Well, that's certainly a boring idea. It's the implicit message of just about everything James Taylor has ever written". He went on to describe how Dylan explores the difficulty of retaining privacy while making public art; the singer is {{coming to terms with}} unwanted attention inherent in stardom, without giving up his connection to his fans. Marcus argued that the reason the single was not a hit in the US was because [...] "the time has passed when people are interested in hearing Bob Dylan say he'll <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and watch the river flow... even though that's not quite what he's saying". For Marcus, [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] is a compelling work, but the subtlety of the song may have prevented it from reaching a wide audience.|$|E
500|$|Fall Out Boy {{began writing}} {{material}} for a possible successor shortly {{after the release of}} the 2007 album, Infinity on High. In March 2008, the band attempted to enter the Guinness Book of World Records for being the only musical act to perform in all seven continents in nine months, planning to perform in Antarctica for an audience of scientists. However, the group was unable to make the flight from Punta Arenas, Chile to Antarctica due to poor weather. Despite this unsuccessful attempt, the group felt energized from the experience and became inspired to write more music. This led to more material to sift through when the band decided to enter the studio. Fall Out Boy spent time during June 2008 formulating ideas at Avron's home, where [...] "three to four" [...] song ideas were developed. Lead vocalist/guitarist Patrick Stump and bassist/lyricist Pete Wentz began turning these ideas into songs over the following month. Wentz explained that the process was the same as usual: [...] "I'll go over to Patrick's house and he'll kind of <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and play songs, and I'll be like, 'Ah, that one's awesome!'" ...|$|E

In winning the All American, he led from the start on a sloppy, muddy track.

All I had to do was <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and let him roll." [...] His time of 20.46seconds to cover [...] was remarkable considering that three days of rain {{before the start of the}} race had turned the track into a muddy quagmire.

500|$|The {{music video}} gained a {{significant}} amount of airplay on the BET and MTV networks, as it increased mainstream notice and appeal of D'Angelo upon the release of Voodoo in January 2000. Viewer response to the [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] music video was largely divided along sexual lines, as female viewers generally expressed favor to the video. Additionally, D'Angelo's video appearance, including a notable amount of sweating around his abdomen, contributed to rumors of him receiving oral sex in the video. For an April 2000 article for Vibe, Questlove interviewed D'Angelo and asked him [...] "Are you getting head in that video?", after which D'Angelo responded by laughing. Questlove then asked [...] "So you're not going to answer that?", and D'Angelo responded, [...] "No". In her response to the video, television personality Star Jones said that, [...] "D'Angelo is singing about being intimate with a woman that he loves, and it's just basic voice and body, and when you're in an intimate situation with a man, that's really all that's there — the voice and the body and the light hitting the body {{in a way that makes}} you know that this is your man". Danyel Smith, editor for Time Inc. at the time, said [...] "It's so sexy. It's about time that girls had something luscious to look at while they're listening to a song. For years, men have been treated to breasts and butts along with their favorite songs, and women have had to <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and endure." [...] In an interview for The New York Times, Smith also said that she had encountered an appreciative reaction among women to the adult sexuality of the music video. She continued, recalling her experience at a salon where the video was viewed, stating: ...|$|E

60|$|There was no {{candle in}} any window, {{and when she}} pushed in {{and stood in the}} hall, {{listening}} a moment, her step awakened no answering sound. Her heart failed her; Verena's staying out in a boat from ten o'clock in the morning till nightfall was too unnatural, and she gave a cry, as she rushed into the low, dim parlour (darkened on one side, at that hour, by the wide-armed foliage, and on the other by the veranda and trellis), which expressed only a wild personal passion, a desire to take her friend in her arms again on any terms, even the most cruel to herself. The next moment she started back, with another and a different exclamation, for Verena was in the room, motionless, in a corner--the first place in which she had seated herself on re-entering the house--looking at her with a silent face which seemed strange, unnatural, in the dusk. Olive stopped short, and for a minute the two women remained as they were, gazing at each other in the dimness. After that, too, Olive still said nothing; she only went to Verena and sat down beside her. She didn't {{know what to make of}} her manner; she had never been like that before. She was unwilling to speak; she seemed crushed and humbled. This was almost the worst--if anything could be worse than what had gone before; and Olive took her hand with an irresistible impulse of compassion and assurance. From the way it lay in her own she guessed her whole feeling--saw it was a kind of shame, shame for her weakness, her swift surrender, her insane gyration, in the morning. Verena expressed it by no protest and no explanation; she appeared not even to wish to hear the sound of her own voice. Her silence itself was an appeal--an appeal to Olive to ask no questions (she could trust her to inflict no spoken reproach); only to wait till she could lift up her head again. Olive understood, or thought she understood, and the woefulness of it all only seemed the deeper. She would <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>there</b> and hold her hand; that was all she could do; they were beyond each other's help in any other way now. Verena leaned her head back and closed her eyes, and for an hour, as nightfall settled in the room, neither of the young women spoke. Distinctly, it was a kind of shame. After a while the parlour-maid, very casual, in the manner of the servants at Marmion, appeared on the threshold with a lamp; but Olive motioned her frantically away. She wished to keep the darkness. It was a kind of shame.|$|E
