Pe is the early promoter which is negatively regulated by the repressor. It was found, by DNase I protection studies, that the P 2 repressor enhances the binding of RNA polymerase to Pc. Furthermore, under in vivo conditions the transcription initiated at Pc, measured as chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene expression, is low {{in the absence of}} repressor but is stimulated by low repressor levels. With increasing repressor concentrations transcription from the Pc promoter decreases. Thus, the P 2 repressor both negatively and positively regulates its own promoter...|$|E
40|$|P 1 {{bacteriophage}} carries {{at least}} two replicons: a plasmid replicon and a viral lytic replicon. Since the isolated plasmid replicon can maintain itself stably at the low copy number characteristic of intact P 1 prophage, it has been assumed that this replicon is responsible for driving prophage replication. We provide evidence that when replication from the plasmid replicon is prevented, prophage replication continues, albeit at a reduced rate. The residual plasmid replication is due to incomplete repression of the lytic replicon by the c 1 <b>immunity</b> <b>repressor.</b> Incomplete repression was particularly evident in lysogens of the thermoinducible P 1 c 1. 100 prophage, whose replication at 32 degrees C remained almost unaffected when use of the plasmid replicon was prevented. Moreover, the average plasmid copy number of P 1 in a P 1 c 1. 100 lysogen was elevated {{with respect to the}} copy number of P 1 c 1 +. The capacity of the lytic replicon to act as an auxiliary in plasmid maintenance may contribute to the extraordinary stability of P 1 plasmid prophage...|$|E

The predicted amino acid sequence of this protein shows similarity at its C-terminal to KorA from the central control operon of RK 2 and at its N-terminal to <b>immunity</b> <b>repressor</b> protein from phage phi 105 of Bacillus subtilis {{as well as the}} Sin protein of B. subtilis which regulates alternate developmental processes including sporulation, motility and competence. We show that TrbA represses transcription of both trfA (vegetative replication) and kilBI (trbB) (required for conjugative transfer and whose product has similarity to ComG, required for competence of B. subtilis) and may help to coordinate expression of both sets of functions. This region has similarities to some temperate bacteriophage immunity regions in modulating divergent transcription required for alternative means of propagation...|$|E

40|$|P 2 is the {{prototype}} phage of the non-lambdoid P 2 family of temperate phages. A developmental switch determines whether a temperate phage will grow lytically or form lysogeny after infection. P 2 related phages have two face-to-face located promoters controlling the lysogenic and the lytic operon respectively, and two <b>repressors.</b> The <b>immunity</b> C <b>repressor</b> of P 2 {{is the first}} gene of the lysogenic operon and it represses the lytic promoter. The Cox protein, the first gene of the lytic operon, is multifunctional. It represses the lysogenic promoter, acts as a directionality factor in site-specific recombination and activates the PLL promoter of satellite phage P 4. This thesis focuses on comparisons between the developmental switches of P 2 and the two heteroimmune family members, P 2 Hy dis and WΦ. A characterization of the developmental switch region of P 2 Hy dis identifies a directly repeated sequence which is important for C repression. P 2 Hy dis Cox can substitute for P 2 Cox in repression of the P 2 lysogenic promoter, excision of a P 2 prophage and activation of P 4 PLL. The P 4 ε protein can derepress the developmental switch of P 2 Hy dis. Functional characterizations of the C repressors and Cox proteins of P 2 and WΦ show that both C repressors induce bending of their respective DNA targets. WΦ C, like P 2 C, has a strong dimerization activity in vivo, {{but there are no}} indications of higher oligomeric forms. Despite the high degree of identity in the C-terminus, required for dimerization in P 2 C, they seem to be unable to form heterodimers. The two Cox proteins are predicted to have identical secondary structures containing a helix-turn-helix motif believed to be involved in DNA binding. It is, however, not possible to change the DNA specificity of P 2 Cox to that of WΦ Cox by swapping the presumed recognition helix. P 2 Cox recognizes a sequence repeated at least six times in the different targets, while WΦ Cox seems to recognize a single direct repeat. In contrast to P 2 Cox, WΦ Cox binds with a stronger affinity to the switch region than to the attachment site (attP). The Cox proteins induce a strong bend in their DNA targets, strengthening the hypothesis that they have a structural role at site-specific recombination. Both proteins show a capacity to oligomerize, but P 2 Cox has a higher tendency to form oligomers than WΦ Cox. The P 2 integrase mediates site-specific recombination leading to integration or excision of the P 2 genome in or out of the host chromosome. P 2 Cox controls the direction by inhibiting integration and promoting excision. In this work it is shown that Cox and Int bind cooperatively to attP...|$|R
40|$|Defective mutants {{from several}} cistrons of {{bacteriophage}} λ give a normal or subnormal burst following infection of a bacterial strain lysogenic for a closely related but hetero-immune bacteriophage, whereas {{there is no}} phage production on the corresponding, non-lysogenic, strain. This effect ("prophage complementation") results from the induction of prophage genes following the heteroimmune super-infection. Since the control exerted by immunity on these genes can thus be by-passed in trans, one has to conclude that these genes are not directly blocked by immunity; rather, the <b>immunity</b> <b>repressor</b> prevents the synthesis of a diffusible substance which normally operates as an inducer of these genes. The results suggest that gene N has the key role of producing the early inducer. The immunity represser prevents N from operating and thence indirectly blocks the other functions. From a more general viewpoint, the situation described here offers concrete examples of the mechanisms which {{may be involved in}} the orderly expression of a developmental process. The occurrence of triggering of groups of genes by diffusible products originating from "earlier" genes deserves special mention. © 1966. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|We have {{identified}} and sequenced a bacteriophage phi 105 gene encoding an <b>immunity</b> <b>repressor,</b> {{the first to}} be characterized from a temperate phage infecting a Gram-positive host. Using superinfection immunity as an assay for repressor function, the phi 105 repressor gene was located within a 740 -bp PvuII-HindIII subfragment near the left end of the phi 105 EcoRI-F fragment. We show that the repressor is specified by the 5 '-proximal coding sequence of a translationally overlapping gene pair, transcribed from right to left on the conventional phi 105 map. Comparison of its amino acid sequence (146 residues) with that {{of a large number of}} Gram-negative bacterial and phage repressors revealed a putative DNA-binding region between positions 20 and 39. The coding region is preceded by a strong Shine-Dalgarno sequence 5 ' AAAGGAG 3 '. Deletion analysis of the 5 '-flanking DNA allowed to identify transcriptional control elements. Their structure, 5 ' TTGTAT 3 ' at - 35 and 5 ' TATAAT 3 ' at - 10, strongly suggests that the phi 105 repressor gene is transcribed by the major vegetative form of B. subtilis RNA polymerase, as would be expected for an early phage gene...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount and}} {{distribution}} of variation in the genomic region containing the genes in the lytic-lysogenic genetic switch and the sequence that determines the integration site into the host chromosome were analyzed for 38 P 2 -like phages from Escherichia coli. The genetic switch consists of two convergent mutually exclusive promoters, Pe and Pc, and two repressors, C and Cox. The <b>immunity</b> <b>repressor</b> C blocks the early Pe promoter, leading {{to the establishment of}} lysogeny. The Cox repressor blocks expression of Pc, allowing lytic growth. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the C and Cox proteins were distributed into seven distinct classes. The phylogenetic relationship differed between the two proteins, and we showed that homologous recombination {{plays a major role in}} creating alterations in the genetic switch, leading to new immunity classes. Analyses of the host integration site for these phages resulted in the discovery of a previously unknown site, and there were at least four regular integration sites. Interestingly, we found no case where phages of the same immunity class had different host attachment sites. The evolution of immunity and integration sites is complex, since it involves interactions both between the phages themselves and between phages and hosts, and often, both regulatory proteins and target DNA must change...|$|E
40|$|As {{opposed to}} the vast {{majority}} of prokaryotic repressors, the <b>immunity</b> <b>repressor</b> of temperate Escherichia coli phage P 2 (C) recognizes non-palindromic direct repeats of DNA rather than inverted repeats. We have determined the crystal structure of P 2 C at 1. 8 [*]Å. This constitutes the first structure solved from the family of C proteins from P 2 -like bacteriophages. The structure reveals that the P 2 C protein forms a symmetric dimer oriented to bind the major groove of two consecutive turns of the DNA. Surprisingly, P 2 C has great similarities to binders of palindromic sequences. Nevertheless, the two identical DNA-binding helixes of the symmetric P 2 C dimer have to bind different DNA sequences. Helix 3 is identified as the DNA-recognition motif in P 2 C by alanine scanning and the importance for the individual residues in DNA recognition is defined. A truncation mutant shows that the disordered C-terminus is dispensable for repressor function. The short distance between the DNA-binding helices together with a possible interaction between two P 2 C dimers are proposed to be responsible for extensive bending of the DNA. The structure provides insight into the mechanisms behind the mutants of P 2 C causing dimer disruption, temperature sensitivity and insensitivity to the P 4 antirepressor...|$|E
40|$|Bacteriophages P 2 and WΦ are {{heteroimmune}} {{members of}} the P 2 -like family of temperate Escherichia coli phages. Temperate phages can grow lytically or form lysogeny after infection. A transcriptional switch that contains two con-vergent promoters, Pe and Pc, and two repressors regulate what life mode to enter. The <b>immunity</b> <b>repressor</b> C is the first gene of the lysogenic operon, and it blocks the early Pe promoter. In this work, some characteristics of the C proteins of P 2 and WΦ are compared. An in vivo genetic analysis shows that WΦ C, like P 2 [*]C, has a strong dimerization activity {{in the absence of}} its DNA target. Both C proteins recognize two directly repeated sequences, termed half-sites and a strong bending is induced in the respective DNA target upon binding. P 2 [*]C is unable to bind to one half-site as opposed to WΦ, but both half-sites are required for repression of WΦ Pe. A reduction from three to two helical turns between the centers of the half-sites in WΦ has no significant effect on the capacity to repress Pe. However, the protein–DNA complexes formed differ, as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift experiments. A difference in spontaneous phage production is observed in isogenic lysogens...|$|E
40|$|A single-copy {{chromosomal}} reporter {{system was}} used to measure the intrinsic strengths and interactions between the three promoters involved in the establishment of lysogeny by coliphage 186. The maintenance lysogenic promoter p L for the <b>immunity</b> <b>repressor</b> gene cI is intrinsically � 20 -fold weaker than the lytic promoter p R. These promoters are arranged face-to-face, and transcription from p L is further weakened some 14 -fold by the activity of p R. Efficient establishment of lysogeny requires the p E promoter, which lies upstream of p L and is activated by the phage CII protein to a level comparable to that of p R. Transcription of p E is less sensitive to converging p R transcription and raises cI transcription at least 55 -fold. The p E promoter does not occlude p L but inhibits lytic transcription by 50 %. This interference is not due to bound CII preventing elongation of the lytic transcript. The p E RNA is antisense to the anti-immune repressor gene apl, but any role of this in the establishment of lysogeny appears to be minimal. Temperate bacteriophages provide model systems for studying developmental switches. One question of interest is how these phages achieve efficient and conditional transitions between the lytic and lysogenic alternative developmental states.

40|$|Phage P 2 induces the {{unrelated}} prophage P 4. In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} {{this is due to}} the activation of the P 4 late promoter PII by the P 2 Cox protein. This is in contrast to the effects of Cox on P 2, for which it is known from previous work that it acts as a repressor of the promoter Pc, which is responsible for expression of the <b>immunity</b> <b>repressor</b> C. The activator role of Cox was revealed by its effect on replication of P 4 DNA and on the formation of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase when a promoterless cat gene was inserted downstream of the P 4 PII promoter. DNase I protection studies revealed that the Cox protein binds to the repressor promoter Pc of phage P 2 and to the promoter PII of phage P 4. In the latter case the Cox protein binds upstream of the - 35 region, in analogy to several other activators of promoters. A weak binding was found in the promoters Pe of phage P 2 and Ple of phage P 4. The Cox protein is a case of viral transactivation of the replication genes of one phage by a control protein of the other. However, the effects of the Cox protein are totally different in the two phages, repressive in one case and activating in the other...|$|E
40|$|The C-terminal domain (CTD) of {{bacteriophage}} Mu <b>immunity</b> <b>repressor</b> (Rep) regulates DNA binding by the N-terminal {{domain and}} degradation by ClpXP protease. Five residues at the Rep C terminus (CTD 5) {{can serve as}} a ClpX recognition motif, but it is dormant unless activated, a state that can be induced by the presence of dominant-negative mutant repressors (Vir). Conversion of Rep to ClpXP-sensitive form was associated with not only increased exposure of CTD 5 to solvent but also increased CTD motion or flexibility as measured by fluorescence anisotropy. CTD mutations (V 183 S, K 193 S, and V 196 S) promoting ClpXP resistance without destroying the recognition motif prevented increased CTD motion induced by Vir. Suppression of ClpXP protease resistance conferred by the V 196 S mutation also correlated with restoration of CTD motion. The temperature-sensitive R 47 Q mutation present in cis within the DNA-binding domain restored ClpXP protease sensitivity to the V 196 S mutant, and anisotropy analysis indicated that R 47 Q allows the V 196 S CTD to gain increased flexibility when Vir was present. The results indicate that the CTD functions to turn the recognition motif on and off, most likely by modulating flexibility of the domain that harbors the ClpX recognition motif, suggesting a general mechanism by which proteins can regulate their own degradation...|$|E

The RecA-dependent SOS response and the RapI-PhrI cell sensory system activate ICEBs 1 gene expression by stimulating cleavage of ImmR, the ICEBs 1 <b>immunity</b> <b>repressor,</b> by the protease ImmA. We found that {{increasing the amount}} of wild-type ImmA in vivo caused partial derepression of ICEBs 1 gene expression. However, during RapI-mediated derepression of ICEBs 1 gene expression, ImmA levels did not detectably increase, indicating that RapI likely activates the protease ImmA by increasing its specific activity. We also isolated and characterized mutations in immA (immAh) that cause partial derepression of ICEBs 1 gene expression in the absence of inducing signals. We obtained two types of immAh mutations: one type caused increased amounts of the mutant proteins in vivo but no detectable effect on specific activity in vitro; the other type had no detectable effect on the amount of the mutant protein in vivo but caused increased specific activity of the protein (as measured in vitro). Together, these findings indicate that derepression of ICEBs 1 gene expression is likely caused by an increase in the specific activity of ImmA. Homologs of ImmA and ImmR are found in many mobile genetic elements, so the mechanisms that regulate ImmA-mediated cleavage of ImmR may be widely conserved.

40|$|The P 2 Cox {{protein is}} known to repress the Pc promoter, which {{controls}} {{the expression of the}} P 2 <b>immunity</b> <b>repressor</b> C. It has also been shown that Cox can activate the late promoter PLL of the unrelated phage P 4. By this process, a P 2 phage infecting a P 4 lysogen is capable of inducing replication of the P 4 genome, an example of viral transactivation. In this report, we present evidence that Cox is also directly involved in both prophage excision and phage integration. While purified Cox, in addition to P 2 Int and Escherichia coli integration host factor, was required for attR x attL (excisive) recombination in vitro, it was inhibitory to attP x attB (integrative) recombination. The same amounts of Int and integration host factor which mediated optimal excisive recombination in vitro also mediated optimal integrative recombination. We quantified and compared the relative efficiencies of attB, attR, and attL in recombination with attP and discuss the functional implications of the results. DNase I protection experiments revealed an extended 70 -bp Cox-protected region on the right arm of attP, centered at about + 60 bp {{from the center of the}} core sequence. Gel shift assays suggest that there are two Cox binding sites within this region.

40|$|Escherichia coli phage P 4 lacks all of {{the genetic}} {{information}} necessary for capsid, tail, and lysis functions. P 4 is therefore dependent on a helper phage, such as P 2, for lytic propagation. During P 4 superinfection of a P 2 lysogen, the P 2 prophage is derepressed {{by the action of}} the P 4 -encoded epsilon gene. We have cloned the epsilon gene and identified the 10 -kDa E protein. The epsilon gene product is the only P 4 protein required to derepress prophage P 2, which leads to in situ P 2 DNA replication. A two-plasmid derepression assay system has been developed to examine the derepression activity of E. The reporter plasmid contains the two face-to-face promoters, Pe and Pc, involved in the lysis-lysogeny transcriptional switch of phage P 2 and the <b>immunity</b> <b>repressor</b> C. The Pe promoter is coupled to a cat reporter gene. In the construct, the C repressor is transcribed from the Pc promoter and represses the Pe promoter, which mimics the in situ-repressed P 2 prophage. The E protein is supplied in trans from a compatible plasmid in which the epsilon gene is {{under the control of the}} T 7 promoter. We show here that in the two-plasmid assay system, induction of the E protein derepresses the Pe promoter. The ash 9 mutation, which is located upstream of the epsilon gene, enhances the E-mediated derepression of the Pe promoter.

Mycobacteriophage BPs and its relatives use an unusual integra-tion-dependent immunity system in which the phage attachment site (attP) is located within the repressor gene (33) such that site-specific integration leads to synthesis of a prophage-encoded product (gp 33103) that is 33 residues shorter at its C-terminus than the virally-encoded protein (gp 33136). However, the shorter form of the repressor (gp 33103) is stable and active in repression of the early lytic promoter PR, whereas the longer virally-encoded form (gp 33136) is inactive due to targeted degradation via a C-terminal ssrA-like tag. We show here that both forms of the repressor bind similarly to the 33 – 34 intergenic regulatory region, and that BPs gp 33103 is a tetramer in solution. The BPs gp 33103 repressor binds to five regulatory regions spanning the BPs genome, and regulates four promoters including the early lytic promoter, PR. BPs gp 33 103 has a complex pattern of DNA recognition in which a full operator binding site contains two half sites separated by a variable spacer, and BPs gp 33103 induces a DNA bend at the full operator site but not a half site. The operator site structure is unusual in that one half site corresponds to a 12 bp palindrome identified previ-ously, but the other half site is a highly variable variant of the palindrome...|$|E

The genome of the temperate cos-site S. thermophilus phage Sfi 21 is 3. 3 kb longer (40, 740 bp, 53 orfs). Both genomes are very similarly organized and differed mainly by gene deletion and DNA rearrangement events in the lysogeny module; gene replacement, duplication, and deletion events in the DNA replication module, and numerous point mutations. The level of point mutations varied from 15 % (DNA packaging and head morphogenesis modules). A dotplot analysis showed nearly a straight line over the left 25 kb of their genomes. Over the right genome half, a more variable dotplot pattern was observed. The entire lysogeny module from Sfi 21 comprising 12 genes was replaced by 7 orfs in Sfi 19, six showed similarity with genes from temperate pac-site S. thermophilus phages.

P 2 -like phages {{are thought to be}} one of the most genetically homogenous phage groups but the regulatory region nevertheless varies extensively between different phage genomes. The analyses showed that there are many types of regulatory regions, but two types can be clearly distinguished; regions similar either to the phage P 2 or to the phage 186 regulatory regions. These regions were also found to be most frequent among the sequenced P 2 -like phage or prophage genomes, and common in phages using Escherichia coli as a host. Both the phylogenetic and the structural analyses showed that these two regions are related.

Two forms of the variant phage have been studied: lambda altSF lambda, which exhibits the <b>immunity</b> (<b>repressor</b> recognition) of phage lambda, and lambda altSF 22, which exhibits the immunity of Salmonella phage P 22. Lysates made from single plaques of lambda altSF lambda contain 10 - 30 % phage of the P 22 form. Similarly, lysates from single plaques of lambda altSF 22 contain as much as 1 % phage of the lambda form. Heteroduplex analyses reveal the following features of the lambda altSF chromosomes: (i) each form has the immunity genes appropriate to its immune phenotype, (ii) the substituted segments include genes involved in regulation and replication, and (iii) the alt phages have unusual additions and substitutions of DNA not normally found associated with either immunity region. In the case of lambda altSF lambda, {{there is a small}} insertion in the region of the cI gene. Because revertants that lose this inserted DNA concomitantly lose the ability to substitute, we conclude that the insertion plays a role in the substitution process. In the case of change from lambda altSF lambda to lambda altSF 22, the substituting P 22 genes are derived from the E. coli host. We have identified a set of Salmonella phage P 22 genes in a standard nonlysogenic strain of E. coli K- 12 that is apparently carried in a silent form. The reason for this lack of expression is not obvious, because this P 22 material includes structural genes and associated promoters and is potentially active.

The phage integration site was located at 88. 6 min of the Escherichia coli K- 12 map, where a 47 -nucleotide sequence was found to be identical in the host and phage genomes. The WΦ Int protein belongs to the Int family of site-specific recombinases, and it seems to have the same arm binding recognition sequence as P 2 Int, but the core sequence differs. The transcriptional switch contains two face-to-face promoters, Pe and Pc, and two repressors, C and Cox, controlling Pe and Pc, respectively. The early Pe promoter was found to be much stronger than the Pc promoter. Furthermore, the Pe transcript was shown to interfere with Pc transcription. By site-directed mutagenesis, the binding site of the <b>immunity</b> <b>repressor</b> was located to two direct repeats spanning the Pe promoter. A point mutation in one or the other repeat does not affect repression by C, but when it is included in both, C has no effect on the Pe promoter. The Cox repressor efficiently blocks expression from the Pc promoter, but its DNA recognition sequence was not evident. Most members of the P 2 family of phages are able to function as helpers for satellite phage P 4, which lacks genes encoding structural proteins and packaging and lysis functions. In this work it is shown that P 4 E, known to function as an antirepressor by binding to P 2 C, also turns the transcriptional switch of WΦ from the lysogenic to the lytic mode.

However 21 ORFs appeared to be organized in clusters that could code for head and tail structural proteins and <b>immunity</b> <b>repressor</b> proteins. In addition, the pattern of gene expression showed that several LE 1 genes are expressed specifically either in LE 1 prophage or in L. biflexa late after infection. Since the LE 1 prophage replicates autonomously as a circular replicon in L. biflexa, we were able to engineer an L. biflexa-Escherichia coli shuttle vector from a 5. 3 -kb DNA fragment of LE 1 (Saint Girons et al., J. Bacteriol. 182 : 5700 - 5705, 2000), opening this genus to genetic manipulation. In this study, base compositional asymmetry confirms the location of the LE 1 replication region and suggests that LE 1 replicates via a bidirectional Θ-like replication mechanism from this unique origin. By subcloning experiments, the replication region can be narrowed down to a 1 -kb region. This minimal replication region consists of a rep encoding a protein of 180 amino acids. Upstream from rep, putative partitioning genes, called parA and parB, were found to be similar to the par loci in Borrelia plasmids. A significant increase of plasmid stability in L. biflexa can be seen only when both parA and parB are present. These results enable the construction of new shuttle vectors for studying the genetics of Leptospira spp. This study will also contribute to a better knowledge of phages unrelated to lambdoid phages...|$|E

The focus of biochemical studies can vary, from a complex mammalian system to a more simple viral entity, but the same methods and principles apply. In biochemistry one rely on both in vitro and in vivo analyses to understand biological processes. Protein crystallography has since the late 1950 s been an additional important tool. By visualizing the structures of molecules involved in a biological process one can truly comprehend the molecular mechanisms of an organism or cell at the chemical level. This thesis includes structural biochemical work in combination with mutational and functional studies of proteins from both human and virus. Human tetraspanins are integral membrane proteins grouped by their conserved structural features. Many of them have been shown to regulate cell migration, fusion, and signalling in the cell by functioning as organizers of multi-molecular membrane complexes. Several tetraspanins are also implicated in different forms of human cancers. How tetraspanins perform their function is still not known at the molecular level and today very little structural data exist on complete tetraspanin proteins. Structural biochemical studies require mg quantities of purified protein, something that is not easily obtained for membrane proteins. This thesis includes a family-wide approach to achieve full-length tetraspanins for biochemical studies. To facilitate this process a GFP-based optimization scheme for production and purification of membrane proteins in E. coli and S. cerevisiae has been applied. By utilizing this approach, we identified 8 human tetraspanins that can be produced and isolated from either E. coli or S. cerevisiae, and in one case using either system.

Sunshine, Virology 49 : 180 - 187, 1972), (ii) transcriptional repression of the P 2 Pc promoter, which controls {{the expression of the}} <b>immunity</b> <b>repressor</b> C and the integrase (S. Saha, E. Haggård-Ljungquist, and K. Nordström, EMBO J. 6 : 3191 - 3199, 1987), and (iii) transcriptional activation of the late PII promoter of the unrelated satellite phage P 4 (S. Saha, E. Haggård-Ljungquist, and K. Nordström, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 : 3973 - 3977, 1989). A comparison of the DNA regions protected by Cox from DNaseI degradation has revealed a presumptive Cox recognition sequence (Saha et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA). The binding region of Cox in the P 2 Pc promoter contains three presumptive recognition sequences, "Cox boxes," located in tandem. P 2 vir 3 and P 2 vir 24 are virulent deletion mutants unable to plate on Cox-producing strains, most likely because the deletions locate the new early promoters too close to the Cox-binding region (Saha et al., EMBO J.). In this report, spontaneous P 2 vir 3 and vir 24 mutants, no longer sensitive to repression by the Cox protein, have been isolated. These mutants plate with equal efficiency on strains with or without a Cox-producing plasmid, and they have been named cor for cox resistance. Three types are recognized; the four P 2 vir 3 cor mutants have a 1 -base deletion in the first Cox box, while the P 2 vir 24 cor mutants were of two types; four have a base substitution in the first Cox box, and one has a base substitution in the second Cox box. The effect of the Cox protein on the mutated P 2 vir 3 and vir 24 promoters was analyzed in vivo by using fusions to a promoterless cat (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) gene. The activities of the P 2 vir 3 and vir 24 early promoters, as opposed to the wild-type early Pe promoter, are drastically reduced by the Cox protein, and the cor mutation renders them as resistant to Cox as the wild-type Pe promoter. Thus, at least the first two Cox boxes are essential for binding of the Cox protein...|$|E
