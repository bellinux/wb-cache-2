These included some short [...] "hops" [...] of about 6 ft in height from the grass airfield. Initial taxiing performance was unsatisfactory, being incapable of performing high speed taxi runs; this {{was a product of}} the jet engine being highly inefficient when moving at slow speeds.

5000|$|The 6-71 is a {{two stroke}} diesel engine. As the engine will not {{naturally}} aspirate, air is {{provided to the}} engine via a roots-type supercharger.

50|$|Generators can be {{electrically}} connected together {{through the process}} of synchronization. Synchronization involves matching voltage, frequency and phase before connecting the generator to the system. Failure to synchronize before connection could cause a high short circuit current or wear and tear on the generator or its switchgear. The synchronization process can be done automatically by an auto-synchronizer module, or manually by the instructed operator. The auto-synchronizer will read the voltage, frequency and phase parameters from the generator and busbar voltages, while regulating the speed through the <b>engine</b> <b>governor</b> or ECM (Engine Control Module).|$|E

Israeli naval doctrine at the time required that a ship traveling at that speed must be presumed to be a warship. A second boat calculated Libertys speed to be 28 kn. The maximum sustained speed of Liberty was only 17.5 kn, 21 kn being attainable by overriding the <b>engine</b> <b>governors.</b> According to Body of Secrets, by James Bamford, Liberty crewmen (including the Officer-of-the-Deck) and the Court of Enquiry findings the ship was steaming at 5 kn {{at the time of}} the attack.|$|R
50|$|Early Tigers had a {{top speed}} of about 45 km/h over optimal terrain. This was not {{recommended}} for normal operation, and was discouraged in training. An <b>engine</b> <b>governor</b> was subsequently installed, capping the engine at 2,600 rpm and the Tiger's maximum speed to about 38 km/h. Tiger crews report that typical march speed off road was 10 kilometers per hour (6 mph). However, medium tanks of the time, such as the Sherman or T-34, had on average {{a top speed}} of about 45 km/h. Thus, despite the Tiger being nearly twice as heavy, its speed was comparatively respectable. With the tank's very wide tracks, a design feature borrowed from the Soviet T-34, the Tiger had a lower ground pressure than many smaller tanks, such as the M4 Sherman.|$|E
5000|$|Truck {{manufacture}} {{began in}} 1917, with -ton trucks powered by Golden, Belknap and Swartz engines, and a -ton vehicle using a North American engine. The smaller models cost $1,245; the larger models $1,775. Speeds were between 12 and 18 mph, {{depending on the}} <b>engine</b> <b>governor</b> used. Production in 1919 was approximately 3,500. By 1920, all Bethlehem trucks came with electric starter and lights, with the company motto at this time being [...] "Trucks bought today without electric lights {{will be out of}} date tomorrow". Despite these new features, business decreased, with the company going into receivership. The last Bethlehem trucks, and the last vehicles of any type manufactured by the Bethlehem Motor Truck Corporation were assembled in 1926. The factory was bought by Hahn and Company in 1927.|$|E
5000|$|The M1 Abrams's {{powertrain}} {{consists of}} a Honeywell AGT 1500 (originally made by Lycoming) multi-fuel gas turbine capable of [...] at 3000 rpm and 3950 lb·ft Nm at 1000 rpm, and a six speed (four forward, two reverse) Allison X-1100-3B Hydro-Kinetic automatic transmission, giving it a governed top speed of 45 mph on paved roads, and 30 mph cross-country. With the <b>engine</b> <b>governor</b> removed, speeds of around 60 mph are possible on an improved surface; however, damage to the drivetrain (especially to the tracks) and {{an increased risk of}} injuries to the crew can occur at speeds above 45 mph. The tank was built around this engine and it is multifuel capable; meaning that it can be powered with diesel, kerosene, any grade of motor gasoline, and jet fuel (such as JP-4 or JP-8). For logistical reasons, JP-8 is the US military's universal fuel powering both aircraft and vehicle fleets. On the other hand, Australian M1A1 AIM SA burn diesel fuel, since the use of JP-8 is less common in the Australian Army.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{traditional}} PID control {{effect is}} not ideal when the controlled object is nonlinear and contains variable parameters. In order to adapt marine diesel engines to variable working conditions, the fuzzy-PID control method was proposed {{to be used}} in the speed control system of marine diesel engine to realize online adjustment of PID parameters. The composition of marine diesel engine speed control system was introduced, and the design of fuzzy–PID controller was analyzed in detail. The fuzzy-PID diesel <b>engine</b> speed <b>governor</b> was simulated through MATLAB. The simulation results show that fuzzy-PID can improve the system dynamic performance, reduce system oscillation and improve the response speed. The results also show that the fuzzy-PID marine diesel <b>engine</b> speed <b>governor</b> has high anti-interference ability and strong robustness...|$|R
2500|$|As 645 power {{assemblies}} {{are more}} readily available than 567 power assemblies, this upgrade may also be employed in so-called [...] "life extension" [...] programs, {{in which case the}} power assemblies would be upgraded, and the engine may be de-turbo-ed, without corresponding changes to the <b>engine's</b> Woodward <b>governor,</b> hence without a corresponding power increase.|$|R
50|$|The <b>engine</b> speed <b>governor</b> is used {{to prevent}} the engine from over-speeding. It has the {{capability}} of disregarding the FCU control. It does this by use of a diaphragm which senses the engine speed {{in terms of the}} centrifugal pressure caused by the rotating rotor of the pump. At a critical value, this diaphragm causes another spill valve to open and bleed away the fuel flow.|$|R
