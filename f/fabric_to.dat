5|$|The company {{adapted the}} old {{gas station and}} café to act as the community's chamber of {{commerce}} and visitor center while preserving the building's architectural features and historical authenticity. Old photographs and interviews with residents were used to aid the company in uncovering the buildings original details. They peeled away decades of paint layers and <b>fabric</b> <b>to</b> find the original interior and exterior colors. One of the more difficult aspects was in restoring the neon accents. While historical photographs showed where neon existed, {{they had all been}} taken during the daytime when the neon lights were off, making it difficult to determine what color the lights originally were.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} of the sticky bomb for physical humour has frequently proved too tempting to be neglected, a good example being David Niven's novel Go Slowly, Come Back Quickly. The unfortunate officer Stanni, while attempting to demolish a smelly privy, loses his dignity and a large section of trouser <b>fabric</b> <b>to</b> such an incident. The sticky bomb also featured in the British television comedy series Dad's Army. In the episode Fallen Idol Lance-Corporal Jack Jones sticks his grenade to an improvised target and retires as instructed but keeps a hold of the grenade which is now primed and stuck to an old dustbin lid.|$|E

25|$|Short cloaks or capes, usually hip-length, {{often with}} sleeves, were worn by fashionable men, usually slung artistically over the left shoulder, even indoors; a fashion of the 1630s matched the cape <b>fabric</b> <b>to</b> the {{breeches}} and its lining to the doublet. Long cloaks were worn for inclement weather.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the layers}} have been quilted, the edges must be {{finished}} and bound. There {{are many different}} ways to bind a quilt.

25|$|Like its predecessors, the V3's body {{consisted}} of welded steel tubing covered with treated <b>fabric</b> <b>to</b> save weight and make repairs easier. Its interior {{was divided into}} four sections— the cockpit, where pilot and observer sat side by side, with the pilot on the left; the load compartment; the engine compartment; and the tail section. The engine and gearbox were centrally mounted and {{held in place by}} a series of tensioned steel cables, with the gearbox in front of the engine. Two steel tube outriggers extended out from the sides of the fuselage to carry the twin rotors, of three-bladed configuration and wooden construction with a steel spar, which were mounted 12.5m (41ft 0in) apart, far enough that they did not overlap.|$|E
25|$|As skirts became {{narrower}} and flatter in front, {{more emphasis}} {{was placed on}} the waist and hips. A corset was therefore used to help mold the body to the desired shape. This was achieved by making the corsets longer than before, and by constructing them from separate shaped pieces of <b>fabric.</b> <b>To</b> increase rigidity, they were reinforced with many strips of whalebone, cording, or pieces of leather. As well as making corsets more constricting, this heavy structure helped prevent them from riding up, or from wrinkling at the waist. Steam-molding also helped create a curvaceous contour. Developed by Edwin Izod in the late 1860s, the procedure involved placing a corset, wet with starch, on a steam heated copper torso form until it dried into shape. While tight lacing continued to be a hotly debated topic among moralists and physicians, most extreme descriptions came from male sexual fantasies.|$|E

25|$|Inside {{the jacket}} of a suit, between the outer fabric {{and the inner}} lining, there is a layer of sturdy {{interfacing}} <b>fabric</b> <b>to</b> prevent the wool from stretching out of shape; this layer of cloth is called the canvas after the fabric from which it was traditionally made. Expensive jackets have a floating canvas, while cheaply manufactured models have a fused (glued) canvas. A fused canvas is less soft and, if poorly done, damages the suppleness and durability of the jacket, so many tailors are quick to deride fused canvas as being less durable, particularly since they may tend to permanently pucker along the jacket's edges after some use or a few dry cleanings. However, some selling this type of jacket claim that the difference in quality is very small. A few London tailors state that all bespoke suits should use a floating canvas.|$|E
25|$|Scouring, is a {{chemical}} washing process {{carried out on}} cotton <b>fabric</b> <b>to</b> remove natural wax and non-fibrous impurities (e.g. the remains of seed fragments) from the fibres and any added soiling or dirt. Scouring is usually carried in iron vessels called kiers. The fabric is boiled in an alkali, which forms a soap with free fatty acids (saponification). A kier is usually enclosed, so the solution of sodium hydroxide can be boiled under pressure, excluding oxygen which would degrade the cellulose in the fibre. If the appropriate reagents are used, scouring will also remove size from the fabric although desizing often precedes scouring and {{is considered to be}} a separate process known as fabric preparation. Preparation and scouring are prerequisites to most of the other finishing processes. At this stage even the most naturally white cotton fibres are yellowish, and bleaching, the next process, is required.|$|E
25|$|The battery was {{initially}} armed with {{four or five}} heavy rifled muzzle loaders for use against large warships. These were replaced in 1895 by more powerful 6-inch rifled breech loaders. In 1905 it was renamed from Grain Battery to Dummy Battery and underwent substantial alterations to its <b>fabric</b> <b>to</b> accommodate {{a new set of}} guns. Two 4.7-inch quick-firing guns were installed {{on the roof of the}} fort to counter smaller and faster adversaries such as torpedo boats and destroyers. They were mounted in a pair of concrete emplacements of a typical low-profile design, with ready-use ammunition recesses adjacent to each gun. The emplacements were linked by a covered way protected by a high parapet wall. A new magazine was also built within the battery's core, with separate storage rooms for shells and cartridges, and a fire control position was added. These alterations resulted in major changes to the form of the terreplein which obliterated many of its original features. A troop shelter also existed behind the main trace of the earthworks.|$|E

50|$|The {{main source}} of life for Kajang tribe is {{agriculture}} and plantations. Most of the men working in farms or paddy fields during the day to meet the needs. When planting season arrives they flock to the fields that are located a few kilo-meters from their homes. They use horses as transportation to the rice fields and water buffaloes for plowing the fields. People {{who do not have}} farms or fields usually work for the owners of the fields. Women usually work at home weaving fabrics. They weave <b>fabrics</b> <b>to</b> be used to make black sarongs called Tope Le'leng. They also sell the woven <b>fabrics</b> <b>to</b> visitors as additional revenue.|$|R

500|$|Thomas Boteler, {{who visited}} Lamu in 1823, {{described}} the fort as [...] "a large square building, with a tower at each corner, but constructed so slightly {{that in all}} probability the discharge of its honeycombed ordnance would soon bring the whole <b>fabric</b> <b>to</b> the ground." [...] It had a [...] "large vaulted entrance ... consisted of three stories of balconies, supported inside by arches. [...] Captain W. F. W.

500|$|The castle {{underwent}} repeated {{repair work}} during the 14th century, though poor maintenance and corruption appears to have caused its <b>fabric</b> <b>to</b> deteriorate rapidly. The main buildings of the inner bailey were totally reconstructed in 1301 but were reported {{to be in a}} ruinous condition only five years later. The castle's constable, Roger de Levelande, was accused of illicitly asset-stripping the castle by breaking up and selling the wooden bridge that connected it to the mainland. Some [...] "wardens" [...] were also accused of burning the timbers of a disused barn. It was estimated that the resulting damage and the ongoing structural deterioration to the curtain wall would cost over £1,000 to repair. Around 1325, the keep was partly demolished and rebuilt. It is possible that by this time the Roman curtain wall was in such a poor state that it was no longer considered part of the castle defences. Various late 13th and early 14th century records describe how sections of the wall had fallen down or been destroyed in sieges. The collapse of the wall on the north-west side is thought to have occurred by no later than the middle of the 13th century, and this event may have made the outer bailey indefensible thereafter.|$|E
