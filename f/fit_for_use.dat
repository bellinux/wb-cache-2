If azeotropic distillation is used to remove water, it will contain trace amounts of the material separation agent (e.g. benzene). Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption. Absolute ethanol {{is used as a}} solvent for laboratory and industrial applications, where water will react with other chemicals, and as fuel alcohol.

The activities of the club were limited {{by the fact that the}} aerodrome at Juhu was not suitable during the monsoon. Much progress had been made in the layout of the ground of the aerodrome by 1932, although the ground was still not <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> during that year's monsoon. J. R. D.

25|$|By June–July 1946, {{the bodies}} in the {{cemetery}} at Batu Lintang had been exhumed and reburied in the military cemetery on Labuan island. In 1947, a grant was approved {{for the establishment of}} a teachers' training college on the site. It exists as such to the present day, the oldest in Malaysia. Of the numerous huts that had housed the prisoners, only 21 were considered <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in 1947; after refurbishment the college moved in July 1948 from its temporary home in Kuching to the site at Batu Lintang. The huts have gradually been replaced over the years, although a few remnants of the site's former life remain. These include a single hut (albeit with a galvanised roof rather than the attap (palm leaf) one of the war), the old gate posts, the gate bunker and stump of the Japanese flag pole. There is also a small museum on the site.|$|E
25|$|On day {{two of the}} inquiry, Major Cooper gave {{evidence}} in respect of the flight of the aircraft, {{based on interviews with}} between 100 and 150 witnesses. He stated that the final manoeuvring of the aircraft was consistent with the pilot experiencing engine trouble and attempting to return to Croydon Airport. He stated {{that it was impossible to}} state that the engine had suffered a partial failure due to the partial obstruction of the petrol pipe. In the week before the crash, the aircraft had been away from Croydon for six days, having landed at Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Ostend, Belgium and Lympne, Kent, before returning to Croydon on the morning of 24 December. No licensed engineer was available at any of the airports away from Croydon. On arrival at Croydon, the engine was reported to be running rough. Routine servicing was carried out and the oil tank drained and refilled with fresh oil. The engine had then been ground tested, including being run for 20 minutes. Major Cooper opined that further investigation should have been undertaken given the report of rough running. It was revealed that a chart recording engine speeds during a flight from Ostend to Lympne was available, but Major Cooper had chosen not to analyse it. Sir Arthur Colefax stated that he would arrange for the document to be analysed to see if it would reveal any rough running in the engine. Evidence was given in respect of the petrol pipe. Major Cooper stated that it would not have been passed as <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in military aircraft, due to its construction. The inquiry was adjourned until 27 January.|$|E

After New Jersey's current state constitution was adopted in 1947 and some departments were consolidated, the department was incorporated into the Department of Law and Public Safety under the New Jersey Attorney General's office. The statutes define an alcoholic beverage as [...] "any fluid or solid capable of being converted into a fluid, suitable for human consumption, and having an alcohol content of more than one-half of one per centum (1/2 of 1%) by volume, including alcohol, beer, lager beer, ale, porter, naturally fermented wine, treated wine, blended wine, fortified wine, sparkling wine, distilled liquors, blended distilled liquors and any brewed, fermented or distilled liquors <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> for beverage purposes or any mixture of the same, and fruit juices." ...|$|E

President Gerald Ford, in an address to the American public on 11 April, promised to evacuate Vietnamese civilians of various categories. The 9th Marine Amphibious Brigade (9th MAB), which was to supply helicopters and a security force for the evacuation, sent a delegation to consult with Ambassador Graham Martin on current plans on 12 April. Ambassador Martin told them that he would not tolerate any outward signs that the United States intended to abandon South Vietnam. All planning would have to be conducted with the utmost discretion. Brigadier General Richard E. Carey, commander of the 9th MAB, flew to Saigon the next day to see Ambassador Martin; he later said that [...] "The visit was cold, non-productive and appeared to be an irritant to the Ambassador". Thirteen Marines from the Marine Security Guard (MSG) detachment were deployed to the DAO Compound on 13 April to replace the eight Marine Guards withdrawn from the closed Danang and Nha Trang consulates who had been providing security up to that point.|$|E

2500|$|... 1918: There {{was only}} [...] of railway; the main lines converged on Russia and were broad gauge. Rolling stock and {{right of way}} were in bad shape.

Finally, out of 4530 freight cars and 187 tank cars, only 1389 and 103 were usable. The Romanians reduced the gauge to a standard , so that cars could be run {{to the rest of}} Europe. Also, {{there were only a few}} inefficient boat bridges. Romanian highway engineers decided to build ten bridges: Cuzlău, Țuțora, Lipcani, Șerpenița, Ștefănești–Brăniște, Cahul-Oancea, Bădărăi-Moara Domnească, Sărata, Bumbala-Leova, Badragi and Fălciu (Fălciu is a locality in Romania.

2500|$|The late 1960s saw the {{completion}} of the memorial. [...] In February 1966, Senator Everett Dirksen (a Mason) dedicated the George Washington museum on the memorial's fourth floor. The dedication meant that the final room in the tower was now complete and open to the public. [...] In 1967, the city of Alexandria changed the street layout around the memorial. [...] As part of this alteration, the memorial granted the city a [...] wide access path (or [...] "alley") between the memorial's access road and Park Road. [...] Since the back wall of the auditorium had never been faced with granite, the protruding steel reinforcing bars had rusted. [...] These were removed in 1968, as they were no longer <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>use.</b> Finally, in 1970, the 40-year-old oil-burning heating plant was replaced with new natural gas-burning boilers, the city of Alexandria donated a back-up electrical generator to keep the tower lit in case of blackouts, additional lighting for the tower was installed, and additional landscaping work completed.|$|E
2500|$|The Mariners' {{fortunes}} {{began to}} improve in [...] Beginning {{in the late}} 1980s, the team had added a core of strong players built around center fielder Ken Griffey, Jr., pitcher Randy Johnson, third baseman Edgar Martínez, and right fielder Jay Buhner. On July 19, , four 15-pound ceiling tiles fell from the Kingdome roof onto the field and into the stadium's seating bowl. The incident led to uncertainty over whether the Kingdome was <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> as a major league stadium, and may well have ultimately been a factor leading {{to the construction of}} Safeco Field. Unable to play at the venue while repairs were being executed, the Major League Baseball Players' Association rejected the idea of playing games at Cheney Stadium in Tacoma or BC Place in Vancouver, feeling that games should not be played in non-MLB venues. This forced the Mariners to play their next 20 games on the road over the span of 21 days. The long trip began miserably as the Mariners started off 2–8, but rebounded to win nine of their next ten games, leaving them just 2 games behind the division-leading Texas Rangers when a players' strike was called on August 12 that resulted in the cancellation {{of the rest of the}} season. Many players felt the time together on the road and the overcoming of the adversity faced that season fed directly into the success the team would achieve in the 1995 season. The extended roadtrip resulted in a peculiarity, in which the first game in a series with the Boston Red Sox – which was supposed to be in Seattle – was rained out; if one still counts this as a home game, it would mark the first – and so far only – home rainout in Mariners history (Safeco Field has a retractable roof, so games can either be played indoors or outdoors, always indoors when it is raining).|$|E
