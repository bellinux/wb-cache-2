60|$|The Paradiseidae are a {{group of}} moderate-sized birds, allied in their {{structure}} and habits to crows, starlings, and to the Australian honeysuckers; but they are characterised by extraordinary developments of plumage, which are unequalled in any other family of birds. In several species large tufts of delicate bright-coloured feathers spring from {{each side of the}} body beneath the wings, <b>forming</b> <b>trains,</b> or fans, or shields; and the middle feathers of the tail are often elongated into wires, twisted into fantastic shapes, or adorned with the most brilliant metallic tints. In another set of species these accessory plumes spring from the head, the back, or the shoulders; while the intensity of colour and of metallic lustre displayed by their plumage, is not to be equalled by any other birds, except, perhaps, the humming-birds, and is not surpassed even by these. They have been usually classified under two distinct families, Paradiseidae and Epimachidae, the latter characterised by long and slender beaks, and supposed to be allied to the Hoopoes; but the two groups are so closely allied in every essential point of structure and habits, that I shall consider them as forming subdivisions of one family. I will now give a short description of each of the known species, and then add some general remarks on their natural history.|$|E

[...] He warns that people doing training should [...] "...be careful not to perform the movements too quickly since the weights tend to make you overextend your techniques which can cause injury to the joints.” Other ways of enhancing the value of <b>forms</b> <b>training</b> include training outdoors in varied conditions and using varying speeds.

Sm2 units can be coupled together with Sm1 units (but not with Sm4 or Sm5 units), <b>forming</b> <b>trains</b> of at most six units (12 cars), but the length of the commuter train platforms limits the maximum length to five units in commercial traffic. Naturally, the full length trains can be seen in the depot traffic in the mornings and evenings.|$|E
5000|$|Chortkiv {{railway station}} is a nodular cargo and {{passenger}} {{station in the}} town of Chortkiv, Ukraine. Chortkiv station is situated on the railway line Ternopil - Chernivtsi. The station serves freight and passengers. The station was built in 1896. The station is equipped with two platforms connected by four ground crossings. The longest platform allows for 14 passenger cars. The number of tracks intended for parking cars and <b>forming</b> <b>trains</b> is 8. A single track connects Ternopil to Chernivtsi, because of the complicated terriain. Trains are propelled by diesel locomotives (2M62),(M62),(DR1А),(CHME3).The line has 400 engineering structures, including 93 bridges, tunnels and overpasses. Maintenance and debugging of rolling stocks is serviced by the locomotive station Chortkiv (TU-6). The railway station Chortkiv has suburban and distant connection.|$|E

50|$|The {{line was}} 7 miles 4 furlongs and 5 chains (12.17 km) long running from Kelly Bray to Calstock. Kelly Bray, {{about a mile}} (about 1.5 km) north of Callington, was at an {{altitude}} of 640 feet (195 m) above sea level and was the railhead for a considerable agricultural hinterland. The line fell all the way to Calstock except for a short sharp climb. There were public depots (i.e. goods stations) intermediately at Monks Corner (later the site of Luckett station), Cox's Park (later Latchley), and Drakewalls (later Gunnislake). There were numerous sidings connecting with mines and quarries, in particular Kit Hill, Hingston Down, Gunnislake Clitters Mine, Plymouth Depot, Pearson's Quarry (at West of England Siding). The locomotive-operated part of the line ended at Incline Station, where there were sidings for <b>forming</b> <b>trains</b> {{at the head of the}} incline.|$|E
40|$|Polymer {{dynamics}} in confinement is both of fundamental interest concerning {{our understanding of}} the glass transition, as well as of high technological importance for the performance of composite materials. The results here presented are concerned with atomistic MD simulations of a chemically realistic model of a 1, 4 -polybutadiene melt (55 % trans and 45 % cis content) confined between two walls of graphite. The focus of our study is to investigate the effects of confinement on the chain {{dynamics in}} the melt and to reveal to what extent the walls are influencing structure and dynamics of the melt. As an example, Fig. 1 depicts the conformation that a chain adopts at an interface by <b>forming</b> <b>trains,</b> loops and tails. It is evident that the chain dynamics of an adsorbed chain may be strongly constrained in comparison to a chain which is not adsorbed at an interface.

As a rule, to form trains of optical picosecond pulses (OPP) designed for obtaining a photoemission in microwave guns, one uses the method with passive mode locking (PML), the block-diagram of which is shown in Fig. 1 a, or the method with active mode locking (AML), Fig. 1 b. Both methods use the intercavity modulation of laser radiation requiring an exact adjustment and a very stable construction...|$|E

40|$|The {{interfacial}} {{interactions of}} four methylcelluloses {{having the same}} average degree of substitution and distribution of methyl groups, but different molar masses, are studied at ambient temperature and at very low polymer concentrations. Firstly, the surface tension σ at the water/air interface is determined for the progressive addition of methylcellulose up to 100 mg/L; σ starts to decrease over 1 mg/L up to the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) at 10 mg/L. The curves describing the influence of polymer concentration on σ are independent of the molar mass at equilibrium. Secondly, the adsorption of methylcellulose on silica particles is estimated from ζ-potential measurements. The data are interpreted {{in terms of an}} increase of the adsorbed layer thickness at the interface when the molar mass of methylcellulose increases. It is concluded that methylcellulose is adsorbed, <b>forming</b> <b>trains</b> and loops at the interface based on the equilibrium between surface free energy and solvent quality...|$|E
