5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s, Berry {{was working with}} local bands in clubs in St. Louis as an extra source of income. He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> blues since his teens, and he {{borrowed}} both guitar riffs and showmanship techniques from the blues musician T-Bone Walker. He also took guitar lessons from his friend Ira Harris, which {{laid the foundation for}} his guitar style.|$|E
5|$|For the 1996 championship, Canavan {{was handed}} the {{captaincy}} of Tyrone, and was Ulster's leading scorer {{for the third}} year in a row, and subsequently awarded his third successive All Star. Tyrone reached the All-Ireland semi-final against Meath, but Canavan was one of six Tyrone players to sustain injuries that day, which some Tyrone fans attribute to Meath's heavy-handedness. Canavan's injury was so severe that he was still feeling the effects for over a year, and there was speculation as to whether he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> on a broken foot.|$|E

5|$|Jeff Porcaro, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> drums with Steely Dan since 1973, {{became a}} mentor to Lukather and furthered his {{interest}} in session work. Lukather's first job {{in the music industry}} was studio work with Boz Scaggs, after which Paich and Jeff Porcaro—who had become prominent session musicians in their own right—asked Lukather to join them in forming Toto in 1976 along with Bobby Kimball, David Hungate, and Steve Porcaro.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Brand New's {{official}} formation, in {{the late}} 1990s, Jesse Lacey, Garrett Tierney and Brian Lane were {{all members of the}} post-hardcore band The Rookie Lot, along with Brandon Reilly and Alex Dunne of Crime in Stereo. After the band's split and not playing together for a while, Lacey, Lane and Tierney started to rehearse again. After Reilly joined The Movielife, they then recruited guitarist Vincent Accardi, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> in a band called One Last Goodbye.|$|E

5|$|Since 1955, Molde <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> {{their home}} games at Molde idrettspark (at the time called Molde stadion), a municipal-owned multi-use venue. A new stadium was {{proposed}} {{to be located}} at the waterfront at Reknes. There were many local protests, including complaints {{about the size of}} the structure. Construction of the land fillings and preparation of the construction site started in March 1997, before final approval had been granted by the municipality.|$|E
5|$|Sussex County Cricket Club {{is one of}} the 18 member clubs of the English County Championship, {{representing}} the historic county of Sussex. Although Sussex representative sides <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> cricket since the mid-eighteenth century and had also played first-class cricket matches since 1815, the County Cricket Club was established on 1 March 1839. They have played first-class matches since 1839, List A matches since 1963, and Twenty20 matches since 2003.|$|E
5|$|Trescothick <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> well in 2002, scoring 161 in the Sri Lankan {{series and}} being awarded the Player of the Series in the tri-nation NatWest Series (including a {{century in the}} final), until his season was cut short when he {{fractured}} his thumb while fielding. He returned for the fourth Test against India, scoring two half-centuries. Trescothick had mixed fortunes in the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy; he followed his century in the NatWest final with a man-of-the-match winning 119 against Zimbabwe, but failed to score as England lost to India and exited the tournament.|$|E

5|$|CP+B and Burger King then filed counter-suit against Slipknot, {{stating that}} the Coq Roq band was fictitious, {{visually}} and musically bore little resemblance to Slipknot's style, and at best was a general parody of heavy metal bands that wear masks or try to achieve a mask-like effect, such as Mushroomhead, KISS or GWAR. Partly mentioned in the counter-suit included the notion that Slipknot were parodies of bands themselves, further citing the specific example of Mushroomhead, who wore near identical style masks and jumpsuits, and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> several years before Slipknot even formed, let alone went mainstream. Both suits were eventually dropped, and Burger King ended the campaign shortly after.|$|E
5|$|Jay Farrar, {{along with}} his {{brothers}} Wade and Dade, played in an early 1980s garage band named The Plebes. Hailing from Belleville, Illinois, The Plebes sought to enter a battle-of-the-bands competition but needed another high school student as a member to perform. They invited Jeff Tweedy, a high school friend of Jay Farrar, to join the band and play with them for the show. Despite a lack of skill with his instrument, Tweedy {{played an important role}} in the band by booking early gigs. While The Plebes <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> music in a rockabilly style, Tweedy wanted to play punk rock like the music that he originally heard the group perform. This caused tensions between Tweedy and Dade Farrar, who left the band two months after Tweedy joined.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{recorded}} football {{match in}} Sheffield occurred in 1794 when {{a game of}} mob football was played between Sheffield and Norton (at the time a Derbyshire village) that took place at Bents Green. The game lasted three days, which was not unusual for matches at the time. It was noted that although there were some injuries no-one was killed during the match. The Clarkehouse Road Fencing Club <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> football since 1852. The city was home {{to a number of}} sports clubs and the popularity of cricket had led to the chairman of Sheffield Cricket Club to suggest the construction of Bramall Lane.|$|E

5|$|A bowler of express pace, Lindwall was {{a regular}} member of the Test team and had opened Australia’s attack since the {{resumption}} of cricket following World War II. During the Australian summer of 1946–47, Lindwall played in all five Tests against the touring Indian cricket team. He played a major part in Australia's 4–0 series win as the leading wicket-taker with 18 scalps {{at an average of}} 16.88, ahead of Ian Johnson and Bill Johnston who took 16 apiece at averages of 16.31 and 11.37 respectively. As a result, Lindwall was selected as part of Don Bradman's Invincibles that toured England without defeat in 1948, with the intention of leading the pace attack. There were two concerns for Lindwall in the lead-up to the tour. Lindwall <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> with an injured leg tendon and his foot drag during the delivery stride led to discussion in the media and among umpires as to its legality.|$|E
5|$|After Johnson scored {{just three}} goals {{in his first}} 24 {{appearances}} of the 2001–02 season, he fell out of favour with new manager Paul Hart, and from February to April 2002, {{in order to reduce}} the club's heavy wage bill, he was allowed to go on loan to fellow First Division clubs Sheffield Wednesday (for whom he scored twice in seven appearances) and Burnley (five goals in eight appearances). Burnley had agreed to pay £120,000 to sign Johnson on a permanent basis at the end of the season, but the transfer ultimately fell through. Upon his return to Nottingham Forest for the 2002–03 season, Johnson appeared to have found his form again that had made him such a success at Ipswich, scoring 29 goals in 47 appearances in all competitions as Nottingham Forest reached the play-offs. In February 2003, it was discovered that Johnson <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> with a torn posterior cruciate ligament, and it was expected that his recovery would rule him out for up to six weeks; however, he was able to make a speedy return and was back in action against Grimsby two weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Australia had injury {{concerns}} to key players {{ahead of the}} tour. Chronic knee injuries had begun to hamper medium-pacer Toshack, and he only made the trip after a 3–2 vote by a medical panel, despite {{being one of the}} first players chosen by the selectors on cricketing merit. Leading paceman Lindwall <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> with an injured leg tendon. In addition, his foot drag during the delivery stride led to speculation about the legality of his bowling action. The injury was worked on ahead of the tour, while Bradman advised Lindwall on how to rectify any suspicion over his bowling action. The Australian captain advised his bowler to ensure that his foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to operate below full speed until the umpires were satisfied. Bradman's counsel was effective, as Lindwall did not have a no-ball problem during the tour.|$|E
25|$|In this regard, 24 Grand Finals <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>played</b> in October (most {{recently}} in 2016), and 10 Grand Finals <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>played</b> on another Saturday in September (most {{recently in}} 2000 {{to avoid a}} clash with the Sydney Olympics).|$|R
5000|$|It marked an {{important}} departure {{in the history}} of the competition, the first time that the camogie final was given an established date on the calendar, being played in Croke Park on the Sunday after the All-Ireland final for men’s teams in hurling.

5|$|During the off-season, it was {{revealed}} that Kesler <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> with a shoulder injury since February 2012. Suffering from a torn labrum, he underwent surgery for the injury in May. Initially expected to have recovered by mid-November, his rehabilitation was extended for several months due to an additional wrist injury which he received surgery for in late-June. As a result, he made his 2012–13 season debut on February 15, 2013, in a 4–3 loss to the Dallas Stars. Due to the NHL lockout, which cancelled the first four months of the season, Kesler only missed 12 games. Within seven games, however, Kesler was back on the injured reserve with a broken foot. He initially sustained the injury in his first game against Dallas, but subsequent X-rays came back negative. After playing through the pain for several games, an additional CT scan revealed the fracture.|$|E
5|$|Iginla {{continued}} {{his pursuit of}} Fleury's franchise record of 830points in 2008–09. He recorded his 800th point with a first period assist against the Chicago Blackhawks on December 19, 2008. He ended 2008 with a career high five points in a New Year's Eve game against the Edmonton Oilers. He had 14 previous four point games. In January, he {{was named to the}} 2009 NHL All-Star Game in Montreal, his fifth such selection. Representing the Western Conference, Iginla scored his first career NHL All-Star Game goal in a 12–11 shootout loss. He passed Fleury as the Flames' all-time scoring leader on March 1, 2009, by recording five points, including his 400th career goal, in an 8–6 loss to the Lightning. He finished the season with 35goals and 89points, but a disappointing playoff performance led to questions of whether he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> with an injury. Iginla quickly denied the rumour, admitted that he had not played with the level of consistency he expected and stated that he would spend the summer focused on improving his play in 2009–10.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, Ehrhoff {{was struck}} in the ear by a puck during a game against Anaheim. He left the contest with what was {{initially}} considered a concussion; however, he was later diagnosed with vertigo instead and missed three games. Recording new career-highs in assists (36) and points (50), he led all Canucks defencemen in scoring, while ranking seventh among League defencemen. Ehrhoff was awarded his second consecutive Babe Pratt Trophy for his regular season efforts. Having won the Presidents' Trophy {{for the first time}} in team history, the Canucks entered the 2011 playoffs with the first seed in the West. They eliminated the Chicago Blackhawks, Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks in the first three rounds to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals {{for the first time in}} 17 years. Facing the Boston Bruins, the Canucks lost the series in seven games. While Ehrhoff led Canucks defencemen and ranked second in the League overall with 12 points (two goals and ten assists) over 23 games, he had a team-worst −13 rating. It was revealed following the Canucks' Game 7 defeat to Boston that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>playing</b> with an injured shoulder.|$|E
