Design: Content validation study. Methods: The defining characteristics of the nursing diagnosis of <b>deficient</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> [dehydration] (00027) were evaluated {{with the help of the}} Fehring Diagnostic Content Validity Model. The set consisted of 125 experts/nurses. The significance of the defining characteristics was rated by the nurses on a Likert scale from 1 to 5. Data collection was carried out from March to September 2016. Results: seven characteristics from 32 were designated primary defining characteristics by the experts: decreased urine output, sunken fontanelle, change in skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, increased urine concentration, elevated haematocrit, and general appearance of exhaustion. 25 characteristics were designated secondary defining characteristics; 12 of which were characteristics from NANDA – I. Items such as: constipation, decreased pulse volume, cramps, absence of tears, and abdominal distension achieved a weighted score under 0. 50. All from the group of related factors were defined as secondary by the experts. Conclusion: The set of experts regarded the primary significant characteristics for the determination of the nursing diagnosis of <b>deficient</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> [dehydration] in newborns to consist in seven defining characteristics.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} nursing diagnoses (ND) currently {{appearing in}} the NANDA-I taxonomy, validated {{in the area of}} cardiology in Brazil. METHODS: An integrative literature review, guided by the following question: what nursing diagnoses were validated in Brazil? Eleven works were analyzed: three content validations and eight clinical validations. RESULTS: The NDs validated were: activity intolerance, decreased cardiac output, spiritual distress, <b>deficient</b> knowledge, excessive <b>fluid</b> <b>volume,</b> ineffective airway clearance, ineffective peripheral tissue perfusion, fear, anxiety, and pain. The highlights were the production of the graduate programs in public institutions, the validation of defining characteristics, models of validation and the modified Fehring criteria for selection of experts. The clinical validation model was used for NDs of the psychobiological sphere; the content validation model was used mainly for NDs in the psychosocial and psychospiritual spheres.

40|$|AIM: To {{verify the}} content {{validity}} of the nursing diagnosis risk for decreased cardiac output (RDCO). BACKGROUND: DCO is a phenomenon that is not restricted to individuals or environments that specifically focus on cardiovascular care. It is not only prevalent in cardiovascular care units, but also in post-anaesthesia units and non-cardiac care units among individuals with non-cardiogenic disorders. A significant decrease in cardiac output is a life-threatening situation, demonstrating the need for developing a risk nursing diagnosis for early intervention. The development of this diagnosis requires {{the construction of a}} diagnosis label, a definition of the diagnostic concept and the risk factors associated with the diagnosis. METHODS: The research was carried out in two methodological stages based on the Fehring diagnosis content validation model. The quantitative analysis consisted of the calculation of the weighted mean of the values attributed by experts to each risk factor, the level of agreement/disagreement between the experts regarding the operational definitions of risk factors and the index of diagnostic content validity (DCV). RESULTS: The label 2 ̆ 7 risk for decreased cardiac output 2 ̆ 7 was considered representative of a nursing diagnosis defined as 2 ̆ 7 at risk of developing a health status characterized by an insufficient quantity of blood pumped by the heart to meet physical metabolic demands 2 ̆ 7. Critical risk factors (DCV 3 ̆e/= 0. 7) were myocardial dysfunction (0. 887), blood loss (0. 875), increase in intrapericardial pressure (0. 825), condition that leads to changes in cardiac rhythm and/or electrical conduction (0. 812), <b>deficient</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> (0. 725), plasma loss (0. 712), ineffective tissue perfusion (0. 712) and electrolyte imbalance (0. 7). CONCLUSIONS: The research identified eight risk factors with valid content for assessment of RDCO. Implications for nursing practice: The identification of risk factors for DCO assists nurses to intervene early and minimize the consequences of a deficient cardiac function...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 INTRODUCTION: Over {{1 million}} Americans {{currently}} {{live with a}} lower limb amputation. Lower limb prostheses {{have been designed to}} produce a secure and comfortable fit between residual limb and prosthesis throughout the day. However, significant <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> fluctuations in the residual limb deteriorate socket fit and may cause decreased mobility due to discomfort or soft tissue injury from increased pressures and shear stresses. Extracellular fluid is thought to be the primary source of limb volume fluctuation and commonly decreases {{over the course of the}} day. Technologies designed to address limb <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> loss are ineffective and cumbersome. Methods to assess limb <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> change are also poor, lacking the capability to quantify <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> loss at high temporal resolution and while the prosthesis is donned. METHODS: Bioimpedance analysis provides tools to rapidly estimate extracellular <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> while a subject performs regular activity with the prosthesis donned. Using a custom bioimpedance analyzer, we tested 16 subjects each on three separate occasions in a repeated measures study. Each test session consisted of an activity sequence followed by a 30 minute period of calm sitting (dubbed the recovery sit). During the recovery sit, subjects sat with their prosthesis donned (ON), prosthesis doffed (OFF), or liner donned (LINER). An identical activity sequence followed the 30 minute sit. RESULTS: Volume changes during the OFF 30 minute recovery sit were significantly higher than during ON (p < 0. 001). We observed that after the limb gained <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> during the OFF protocol, subsequent volume loss was negligible in 12 of 16 subjects during the following activity sequence. Conversely, volume lost during the 30 minute recovery period during ON was not recovered during three cycles of activity. During the LINER protocol, volume gains during the 30 minute sit were similar to those during OFF, but returned to baseline levels during subsequent activity. Gains in LINER during subsequent activity still remained elevated as compared to ON (p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing applied pressure to the residual limb may function to recover limb <b>fluid</b> <b>volume,</b> allowing socket users to maintain a comfortable fit between limb and prosthesis. There exists a potential for development of socket technology that leverages pressure release to recover limb <b>fluid</b> <b>volume...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aim : To {{determine}} {{the value of}} fetal presentation, fetal head shape, fetal gender, estimated amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> and fetal weight estimation as diagnostic parameters - especially at 21 to 24 weeks of gestation. Moreover the calculation of reference values for the estimated amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> and estimated fetal weight at 21 - 24 weeks. Method : Evaluation of a low risk population (20933 sonographic examinations of 13801 singleton pregnancies), recorded {{over a period of}} eight years at a gynecological ultrasound surgery. Hereby a special threedimensional measuring technique was used to estimate the amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>volume.</b> The fetal weight was estimated by using the Shepard&# 65533;s formula, while considering the fetal head shape. Results : Breech presentation compared with head presentation at 21 - 24 weeks of gestation was associated with a higher risk (odds ratio OR= 1, 5) of breech presentation at birth. However, fetal presentation did not become of considerable prognostic value (OR > 100) concerning birth presentation before the 33 rd week. Statistically, at the 33 rd week the "physiological" fetal movement into head presentation is completed. Estimated amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> and estimated fetal weight at 21 - 24 weeks show a highly significant correlation with the birthweight at term (36 - 43 weeks). Measuring the fetal weight at 21 - 24 weeks proved to be a more reliable value to predict high or low birthweight (at term) than the estimated amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> method. Conclusion : While the risk of breech presentation at birth is slightly higher in fetuses showing breech presentation at 21 - 24 weeks, more than 50 % of fetuses in breech presentation by the 33 rd week move into head presentation until birth. The reliability of fetal gender diagnosis - especially at 12 - 14 weeks - speaks in favour of ultrasound as an alternative, non-invasiv way of gender-diagnostic. The estimated amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> at 12 - 24 weeks - compared with invasive methods of determining the amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> as widely publicised in medical literature -, appears to represent the actual amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> quite accurately and therefore seems to be a useful semiquantitative method. However, estimated amniotic <b>fluid</b> <b>volume</b> at 21 - 24 weeks as a single diagnostic parameter proved unsuitable for the accurate birth weight prediction of small or large for gestational age babies at term, whereas the estimated fetal weight at 21 - 24 weeks did prove to be an acceptable diagnostic test - at least for predicting very large gestational age infants...|$|R
