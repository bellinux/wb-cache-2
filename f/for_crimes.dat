40|$|Purpose This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess whether black inmates hold more positive outcome expectancies <b>for</b> <b>crime</b> than white inmates in an effort to inform the debate on the nature of well documented differences in criminal involvement between blacks and whites. Methods Positive outcome expectancies <b>for</b> <b>crime</b> were measured in 393 black male inmates and 154 white male inmates housed in a medium security federal correctional institution using the Outcome Expectancies <b>for</b> <b>Crime</b> (OEC: Walters, 2003 b) inventory. Results Black inmates reported significantly stronger positive outcome expectancies <b>for</b> <b>crime</b> than white inmates after controlling for preexisting group differences in age, education, marital status, confining offense, response style, general criminal thinking, and negative outcome expectancies <b>for</b> <b>crime.</b> Anticipation of social benefits <b>for</b> <b>crime</b> in the form of love, respect, and security were particularly salient in distinguishing between black and white inmates. Conclusions It is speculated that an interaction of motivational (high achievement motivation), structural (blocked economic opportunities), and cultural (peer reinforcement) factors may be responsible for black-white differences in crime with important implications for theory, research, and clinical practice. ...|$|R

5|$|Investigators {{found that}} Fall and a {{relative}} {{had received a}} total of about $400,000 from Doheny and Sinclair, and that the transfers were contemporaneous with the controversial leases.

5|$|Most of {{the first}} Marshalsea, as with the second, was taken up by debtors; in 1773 debtors within 12 miles of Westminster could be imprisoned there for a debt of 40 shillings. Jerry White writes that London's poorest debtors were housed in the Marshalsea. Wealthier debtors secured their removal from the Marshalsea by writ of habeas corpus, and {{arranged}} to be moved to the Fleet or King's Bench, {{both of which were}} more comfortable. The prison also held a small number of men being tried at the Old Bailey <b>for</b> <b>crimes</b> at sea.|$|E

5|$|However, not {{everything}} was always harmonious between {{the king and}} the archbishop. In 1156, Theobald supported the efforts of Osbert de Bayeux, {{who was accused of}} poisoning William the Archbishop of York, to secure a trial for his alleged crimes in an ecclesiastical court rather than in the royal court. The crime had taken place during Stephen's reign, but Stephen's death had prevented Osbert from being tried in 1154. The delay allowed the shifting of the trial to the church courts, which Henry opposed. Although Theobald's position displeased the king no open rupture ensued. Theobald himself admitted to the papacy in 1154 that English custom was to try clergy <b>for</b> <b>crimes</b> in the secular courts.|$|E
5|$|In Gortyn, in Crete, {{according}} to a code engraved in stone dating to the 6th century BC, slaves (doulos or oikeus) {{found themselves in a}} state of great dependence. Their children belonged to the master. The master was responsible for all their offences, and, inversely, he received amends <b>for</b> <b>crimes</b> committed against his slaves by others. In the Gortyn code, where all punishment was monetary, fines were doubled for slaves committing a misdemeanour or felony. Conversely, an offence committed against a slave was much less expensive than an offence committed against a free person. As an example, the rape of a free woman by a slave was punishable by a fine of 200 staters (400 drachms), while the rape of a non-virgin slave by another slave brought a fine of only one obolus (a sixth of a drachm).|$|E
