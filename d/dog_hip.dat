40|$|Antibodies {{directed}} against whole bovine nasal-cartilage proteoglycan {{and against the}} hyaluronic acid-binding region and chondroitin sulphate peptides from the same molecule were used in immunodiffusion and immunoelectromigration experiments. Proteoglycans from bovine nasal and tracheal cartilage showed immunological identity, with all three antisera. Proteoglycans from pig hip articular cartilage, <b>dog</b> <b>hip</b> articular cartilage, human tarsal articular cartilage and rat chondrosarcoma reacted with all the antisera and showed immunological identity with the corresponding structures isolated from bovine nasal-cartilage proteoglycans. In contrast, proteoglycans from rabbit articular cartilage, rabbit nasal cartilage and cultured chick limb buds did not react with the antibodies {{directed against}} the hyaluronic acid-binding region, though reacting with antibodies raised against whole proteoglycan monomer and against chondroitin sulphate peptides. All the proteoglycans gave two precipitation lines with the anti-(chondroitin sulphate peptide) antibodies. Similarly, the proteoglycans reacting with the anti-(hyaluronic acid-binding region) antibodies gave two precipitation lines. The results indicate the presence {{of at least two}} populations of aggregating proteoglycan monomers in cartilage. The relative affinity of the antibodies for cartilage proteoglycans and proteoglycan substructures from various species was determined by radioimmunoassay. The affinity of the anti-(hyaluronic acid-binding region) antibodies for the proteoglycans decreased in the order bovine, dog, human and pig cartilage. Rat sternal-cartilage and rabbit articular-cartilage proteoglycans reacted weakly, whereas chick limb-bud and chick sternal-cartilage proteoglycans did not react. In contrast, the affinity of antibodies to chondroitin sulphate peptides for proteoglycans increased in the order bovine cartilage, chick limb bud and chick sternal cartilage, dog cartilage, rat chondrosarcoma, human cartilage, pig cartilage, rat sternal cartilage and rabbit cartilage...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to pre-clinical studies to evaluate THA components in normal joints, {{attempts have been}} made to induce osteoarthritis in canine models by performing pelvic osteotomies to alter the acetabulum-femoral relationship (Inerot et al. 1991; Renberg et al. 2000). In these models, the joint capsule is not entered but joint mechanics and loading mimic hip dysplasia, with reduced acetabular coverage of the femoral head, and development of osteoarthritis may be inconsistent. Alternatively, debridement of cartilage from the femoral head and acetabulum in sheep induces moderately severe hip osteoarthritis (Phillips and Gurr 1989) and resulted in few complications, even though in these studies the use of capsulorrhaphy was not reported (Phillips et al. 1990). However, hip arthroplasty surgery involves arthrotomy, and joint capsule stability is critical for prevention of post-arthroplasty dislocation (Chivas et al. 2006; Tsai et al. 2008; White et al. 2001; Hayes et al. 2011) and for return to a consistent gait (Holnapy et al. 2013). These data led us to evaluate femoral head cartilage debridement with the use of capsulorrhaphy to maintain joint stability and prevent post-operative dislocation or chronic subluxation as a method of inducing osteoarthritis in the <b>dog</b> <b>hip.</b> In future studies, maintenance of joint stability post-operatively could also allow the effect of novel therapeutics to be better evaluated, without masking of treatment effects by post-operative instability. The objective of this study was to develop a model of hip osteoarthritis in the dog that would induce functional disability and radiographic abnormalities similar to those identified in humans and canines with naturally occurring osteoarthritis presenting for THA. Outcome measures relating to function (accelerometry, gait analysis), structure (radiography, goniometry, limb circumference, histology) and pain (pain and function scoring, gait analysis) were evaluated. Of these outcome measures, radiography, dynamic gait analysis and histology represent those most commonly used previously in research studies, whilst in naturally occurring osteoarthritis in the dog, accelerometry, static and dynamic gait analysis, radiography, goniometry, limb circumference and functional scoring all form part of a comprehensive clinical examination and were evaluated to provide a baseline for future studies in this osteoarthritis model.|$|E

25|$|Hip dysplasia, Collie eye anomaly (CEA), and {{epilepsy}} {{are considered}} the primary genetic diseases of concern in the breed at this time.

However, other eye conditions such as PRA slowly disintegrates the retina and can cause Border Collies to lose almost all of their vision at night which can progress into complete daytime blindness. There is now a DNA test available for CEA and, through its use, breeders can ensure {{that they will not}} produce affected pups.

2500|$|Leonbergers are strong, {{generally}} healthy <b>dogs.</b> <b>Hip</b> dysplasia, which devastates {{many large}} breeds, is largely controlled {{because of the}} effort of many breeders who actively screen their Leonbergers using x-rays evaluated by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals and leave dysplastic specimens out of the gene pool, thereby {{reducing the risk of}} bone/joint problems. For over twenty years, breeders belonging to the Leonberger Club of America, which issued pedigrees for the Leonberger breed in America, adhered to many aspects of the German breeding program whereby member kennels may only choose to breed dogs that were certified as three generation free of hip dysplasia.

Methods: This was a randomized, multicenter, blinded, parallel group. Thirty-nine <b>dogs</b> with symptomatic <b>hip</b> OA were assigned to one of the two groups, to receive aMSCs or PRGF.

Results: OA degree did not vary within groups. Functional limitation, range of motion (ROM), owner’s and veterinary investigator visual analogue scale (VAS), and patient’s quality of life improved from the first month up to six months. The aMSCs group obtained better results at 6 months. There were no adverse effects during the study. Our findings show that aMSCs and PRGF are safe and effective in the functional analysis at 1, 3 and 6 months; provide a significant improvement, reducing dog’s pain, and improving physical function.

50|$|A {{study done}} by Cornell University Veterinary School looked at 1,498 dogs from Guiding Eyes for the Blind. The study was {{interested}} in the measurement of hip joint quality. Cornell found a complex generation from a family of Labrador Retrievers. This included 1,236 connected dogs over 17 generations from a particular male dog. The results of selective breeding were evident in the relationship between breeding values and their accuracy. Over half of the Labrador Retrievers were bred at the Guiding Eyes for the Blind facility. Dogs with more accurate breeding values produced more progeny, with clustering of breeding values with higher accuracy indicative of better hip joint confirmation.
