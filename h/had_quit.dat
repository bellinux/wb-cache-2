40|$|Objectives. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compare the socio-demographic, behavioral, and access to care characteristics of smokers who <b>have</b> <b>quit</b> smoking for one or more years and current smokers who have made an attempt to quit smoking within the last year. ^ Methods. Data from the 2005 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) were used to compare current smokers who <b>have</b> tried to <b>quit</b> (n= 2747) and former smokers who <b>have</b> <b>quit</b> for one or more years (n= 6194). The data was analyzed using STATA 9. 0 to perform statistical calculations. ^ Results. Age, education, race and income were associated with smoking status. Respondents aged 65 and older were 36 times more likely to <b>have</b> <b>quit</b> smoking. Education and income had higher odds ratios among quitters (OR= 1. 27 and OR= 1. 21) and Non-Hispanic Whites were the most likely to <b>have</b> <b>quit</b> smoking compared to Hispanics and Blacks. Adults with health insurance coverage were 3. 44 times more likely to <b>have</b> <b>quit</b> smoking. ^ Discussion. Existing research suggests that individual factors relating to demographics behavior and access to care can impact a smoker 2 ̆ 7 s ability to quit smoking. This paper discusses the factors that affect cessation and which populations would benefit from additional research and targeted smoking cessation programs. ...|$|R

Supergirly, which consisted of Louise McClatchy and Jai Simeone, (known as Lou and Jai) would feature in sketches throughout the morning as BBC make-up artists who were rude to the guests, either through a misunderstanding, by being tactless or by mistaking the guests as someone else.

5|$|In 1933, Herman J. Mankiewicz and {{producer}} Sam Jaffe announced {{they were working}} on a picture, to be titled Mad Dog of Europe, which was intended to be a full-scale attack on Hitler.

5|$|The {{characters}} in the series gradually changed during preproduction, with adjustments made to the names, genders and ethnicity. When the cast was announced at first, LeVar Burton was the main actor highlighted because of {{his work on the}} Roots mini series; his character, Geordi La Forge was named for a disabled fan. Although the casting was managed by producers Rick Berman and Robert H. Justman, Roddenberry intervened to switch the characters assigned to Marina Sirtis and Denise Crosby. Sirtis took over Crosby's role as Deanna Troi, and Crosby became Tasha Yar, who had been named Macha Hernandez while Sirtis held the part. Behind the scenes, the writing team became chaotic. Eddie Milkis <b>had</b> <b>quit</b> prior to casting, with Berman taking over from him. Roddenberry's insistence on re-writing scripts and unusual behaviour alienated some staff. Longtime Star Trek contributor D.C. Fontana quit, filing a claim with the Writer's Guild of America as she had been acting as story editor but was unpaid in the role. Such were the troubles that the series had a problem recruiting potential writers halfway through the season. By the end of the , all the writing staff recruited during season one except for Rick Berman <b>had</b> <b>quit.</b>|$|E

Ted Payseur, the school's athletic director, resigned after the season under pressure from alumni {{and was replaced by}} Stu Holcomb. One of Holcomb's first moves was to fire Saban and replace him with Parseghian.|$|E

She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 2 June 2008. Donna was initially introduced as a guest character, but Robbie was promoted to the regular cast shortly after she made her debut. In April 2010, it was revealed that Robbie had told producers she would like to leave when her contract expired {{at the end of the}} year.

5|$|On August 18, 2007, Anderson gave an {{interview}} in which he admitted to using steroids when he was performing on the independent wrestling scene, stating that he <b>had</b> <b>quit</b> using them in November 2005 to comply with WWE's Talent Wellness Program, implying that his job in the promotion was worth more than extra muscle mass. 12 days later, on August 30, his statements were shown to be incorrect when he, along with nine other WWE wrestlers, were named in a Sports Illustrated article as having received performance-enhancing drugs in direct non-compliance with the WWE Talent Wellness Program. Anderson received anastrozole, somatropin, and testosterone between October 2006 and February 2007. He later claimed that the steroids were for a legitimate medical reason, {{saying that they were}} from when he tore his latissimus dorsi muscle in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Some time in 1974, on the {{recommendation}} of Michael Chugg, veteran Melbourne promoter Michael Browning booked the band to play at his club the Hard Rock. Browning had previously managed Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs, unsuccessfully trying to break them into the UK market. He did not like their glam rock image and felt that Evans was the wrong singer for the band, but was impressed by the Young brothers' guitar playing. Shortly afterwards, he received a call from the band; Laughlin <b>had</b> <b>quit</b> as manager, and they were stuck in Adelaide with no money. Browning agreed to bail them out and booked them for another gig at the Hard Rock. Following the gig, they agreed to take him on as their new manager, with the co-operation of their older brother George and Harry Vanda.|$|E

5|$|Truck drivers {{spend up to}} 11hours a day driving, and up to 14hours a day {{engaged in}} various duties (including driving time) such as fueling, filling out paperwork, obtaining vehicle repairs, and {{conducting}} mandatory vehicle inspections. Long-haul drivers often spend weeks away from home, spending their time off and sleeping at truck stops or rest areas. Driving is relatively dangerous work, as truck drivers account for 12 percent and the highest total number of all work-related deaths, and are five {{times more likely to}} die on the job than the average worker. Smoking, lack of exercise, unhealthy eating habits, and work-related injuries also contribute to the driver's generally risk-prone lifestyle. A survey by the National Institutes of Health found 67 percent of long-haul drivers were smokers or <b>had</b> <b>quit</b> smoking.|$|E
5|$|Zoe Carpenter is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the British Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks, played by Zoë Lister.

It was announced in 2009 that Lister <b>had</b> <b>quit</b> her role in order to pursue other projects; she subsequently left the series in January 2010. During Zoe's time in Hollyoaks she has been portrayed as a bubbly tomboy who often makes the wrong choices in life and has {{had a number of}} failed relationships.

5|$|Before season 20, {{little was}} shown {{concerning}} Cartman's romantic interests, {{as for the}} most part, his attitude towards females had been sexist. However, at least in one episode ("Chef Goes Nanners"), Cartman develops an attraction to Wendy, which is apparent {{from the end of}} episode when Wendy describes her temporary infatuation towards Cartman as 'sexual tension' and even though Cartman agrees in front of Wendy, he sighs with sorrow at being alone again. During a period when he was physically unable to control his speech and he repeatedly blurted hidden feelings, he expressed a romantic interest in classmate Patty Nelson, a side character who has not been seen before or since. In Season 20, after Cartman is wrongfully accused of being a persistent and highly aggressive internet troll (actually Gerald Broflovski) leaving foul posts primarily targeting women and girls on South Park Elementary's school message boards, the other boys destroy most of Cartman's electronics, and by extension, his social media presence, causing him to become despondent to everything around him. That is until Heidi Turner, who <b>had</b> <b>quit</b> social media in response to the trolling, offers to show him life outside of social media. The two quickly become friends, and later, an official and shockingly very happy couple.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the strip ended in March 1995 Melchester were in dire straits, {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy, and their {{long-term}} future far from certain. When the strip returned in Match of the Day magazine in May 1997, much of the monthly comic's new continuity was ignored, although the basic thread of the club having struggled against relegation and being severely in debt was continued. It was revealed in the first strip that in the intervening years, while Rovers had managed to survive the threat of bankruptcy, a bribery scandal had caused a mass exodus of players and eventual relegation to Division One. Rocky, meanwhile, was playing for fierce local rivals Melborough, after a bitter falling-out with his father over a car accident in Italy in which his mother, Penny, had been killed. Roy, who <b>had</b> <b>quit</b> football as a result, was blamed by some (including his son) for the accident, even though he had no memory of it, and the precise circumstances surrounding the event were never resolved.|$|E
5|$|Compton asked {{theoretical}} physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer of the University of California, Berkeley, to {{take over}} research into fast neutron calculations—the key to calculations of critical mass and weapon detonation—from Gregory Breit, who <b>had</b> <b>quit</b> on 18 May 1942 because of concerns over lax operational security. John H. Manley, a physicist at the Metallurgical Laboratory, was assigned to assist Oppenheimer by contacting and coordinating experimental physics groups scattered across the country. Oppenheimer and Robert Serber of the University of Illinois examined the problems of neutron diffusion—how neutrons moved in a nuclear chain reaction—and hydrodynamics—how the explosion produced by a chain reaction might behave. To review this work and {{the general theory of}} fission reactions, Oppenheimer and Fermi convened meetings at the University of Chicago in June and at the University of California, Berkeley, in July 1942 with theoretical physicists Hans Bethe, John Van Vleck, Edward Teller, Emil Konopinski, Robert Serber, Stan Frankel, and Eldred C. Nelson, the latter three former students of Oppenheimer, and experimental physicists Emilio Segrè, Felix Bloch, Franco Rasetti, John Henry Manley, and Edwin McMillan. They tentatively confirmed that a fission bomb was theoretically possible.|$|E
5|$|During a brief {{concert at}} the Tool and Die club in San Francisco, Dead Kennedys {{frontman}} and Alternative Tentacles overseer Jello Biafra witnessed their performance and became a fervent fan. Biafra invited the group to open for Dead Kennedys and T.S.O.L. at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles, and soon made an offer that would launch their recording career; {{if they could get}} someone to lend them studio time, Alternative Tentacles would reimburse the studio when the album was complete. The band then returned to San Antonio to record at BOSS Studios (a.k.a. Bob O'Neill's Sound Studios, a.k.a. the Boss). However, the Mathews brothers did not enter the studio with Haynes and Leary; the two <b>had</b> <b>quit</b> following a physical altercation between Scott Mathews and Haynes. The bass position was taken over by Bill Jolly, who would play on Butthole Surfers' next two releases, and a number of drummers participated.
