40|$|Fluorescence of the {{conjugated}} polyene fatty acid, {{parinaric acid}} (PnA), was studied in membranes of Escherichia coli during <b>deenergization</b> by colicin K. The {{free fatty acid}} and biosynthetically esterified forms of cis-PnA (9, 11, 13, 15 -cis,trans,trans,cis-octadecatetraenoic acid), {{both of which are}} sensitive to E. coli lipid-phase transitions, were compared. When free cis-PnA was added exogenously to respiring bacteria, dissipation of the energized state of the membrane resulted in a dramatic increase in cis-PnA fluorescence; all-trans-PnA was much less sensitive. Neither spectral shifts nor a change in cis-PnA fluorescence polarization were observed. Analysis of the PnA content of extracellular fractions of deenergized and control cells revealed a difference in probe distribution: the membranes of energy-poisoned E. coli bound about 77 % of exogenously added cis-PnA, whereas membranes of actively respiring controls bound only about 44 %. No fluorescence enhancement was observed in cells centrifuged to remove unbound cis-PnA before colicin treatment. When cis-PnA was biosynthetically esterified to phospholipids of an unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph of E. coli, the fluorescence did not change during membrane <b>deenergization.</b> In double-probe experiments, membrane <b>deenergization</b> resulted in fluorescence enhancement of exogenously added N-phenyl- 1 -naphthylamine, without change in esterified PnA fluorescence. We conclude that <b>deenergization</b> of E. coli membranes leads to increased binding and fluorescence of exogenously added PnA and cannot be detected from within the inner and outer membranes by PnA esterified in vivo...|$|E

To further assess the role of competition between fatty acids and substrates on inner membrane substrate carriers in the <b>deenergization</b> and the contribution to <b>deenergization</b> of fatty acid effects on respiratory function, digitonin-permeabilized rabbit and mouse tubules were studied using either addition of exogenous oleate after control normoxic incubation or increases of endogenous fatty acids produced by hypoxia/reoxygenation. The results demonstrated major effects of matrix oxaloacetate accumulation on succinate-supported energization and respiration and their modification by fatty acids. Improvements of energization {{in the presence of}} fatty acids by glutamate were shown to result predominantly from lowering matrix oxaloacetate rather than from amelioration of transmembrane cycling of fatty acids and uncoupling. Mouse tubules had 2. 5 fold higher rates of succinate utilization, which resulted in stronger effects of oxaloacetate accumulation than rabbit tubules. Hypoxia/reoxygenation induced respiratory inhibition that was more severe for complex I-dependent substrates. Fatty acids themselves did not acutely contribute to this respiratory inhibition, but lowering them during 60 min. reoxygenation to allow recovery of ATP during that period alleviated it. These data clarify the basis for the nonesterified fatty acid-induced mitochondrial energetic deficit in kidney proximal tubules that impairs structural an...|$|E

In 3 h after ouabain was omitted from the solution, 62 ± 3 % of granule cells had pycnotic nuclei. The supplement of a solution with competitive specific antagonist of NMDA receptors, L- 2 -amino- 7 -phosphonoheptanoate (10 − 4 M, APH) together with ouabain prevented cells from swelling, mitochondrial <b>deenergization,</b> neuronal death and increase of [Ca 2 +]i. These data suggest that cellular Na+/K+-ATPase inactivation in neuro-glial cell cultures of cerebellum leads to glutamate (Glu) accumulation, hyperstimulation of glutamate receptors, higher Ca 2 + and Na+ influxes into the cells through the channels activated by Glu. This process leads to cell swelling, mitochondrial <b>deenergization</b> and death of granule cells.

40|$|Intracellular Ca 2 + {{overload}} and mitochondrial dysfunction {{are considered}} major causes of ischemia-induced cell death. An increase in intracellular Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) {{can also cause}} the activation of calpains. Although the increased activity of these proteinases is suggested to play a relevant role in different forms of cell death, the relationship between calpain activation and mitochondrial dysfunction is not elucidated yet. To this aim the fluorescent potentiometric probe JC- 1 {{was used to assess}} mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in HL- 1 cardiomyocytes. A persistent elevation in [Ca 2 +]i as detected by Fluo- 4 FF fluorescence was obtained by adding HL- 1 cells with the calcium ionophore A 23187 (1 uM) in the presence of 1 mM vanadate to inhibit P-type ATPases and replacing NaCl with KCl in the incubation buffer. The rise in [Ca 2 +]i was followed by MMP fall which occurred in 50 % of the cells 30 min after A 23187 addition. Mitochondrial <b>deenergization</b> was concomitant with calpain activation as detected by the proteolysis of a synthetic peptide (Suc-LLVY-AMC) and the occurrence of cell necrosis as detected by LDH release. Interestingly the extent of enzyme release correlated with the number of cells displaying MMP fall. Cell death was likely due only to necrosis since cleavage of PARP- 1 and caspase- 3 was not detected. Calpains inhibitors, like PD 150606 (30 uM) and calpeptin (100 uM), reduced by 60 % both LDH release and mitochondrial <b>deenergization.</b> Therefore the increase in [Ca 2 +]i does not appear to cause mitochondrial <b>deenergization</b> per se. Interestingly, HL- 1 staining with anti calpain antibodies demonstrated that calpains colocalize with mitochondria. In conclusion, the present data suggest that calpain activation is a causative factor of mitochondrial dysfunction under conditions of intracellular Ca 2 + overload...|$|E

Besides the amplitude properties, regarding to power quality, {{it is important to}} know the structure of their harmonic spectrum. For that purpose, characteristic surges (energization and <b>deenergization</b> of an unloaded 35 kV underground cable, energization of an unloaded 10 kV underground cable and <b>deenergization</b> of a 10 kV overhead line, with a multiple appearance of the arc between the circuit breaker contacts) were analyzed. The signals were obtained by an experiment, so the occurrence of noise makes them much more complex to analyze than the simulated ones. Their harmonic decomposition was performed by digital signal processing methods - Empirical Mode Decomposition and Short Time Fourier Transform. The obtained results were compared to the calculated ones, which allowed us to draw conclusions related to applied methods efficiency and characteristic harmonics values that occur during the switching surges. The performed analysis allows us to get a deeper insight into transient processes in the real transmission power lines. The obtained results can be especially useful to detect the locations of occurrence of various types of surges and for development of real-time power quality monitoring systems...|$|E

Biophys. Acta 1284 (1996) 247 – 252].

40|$|Enteric {{bacteria}} such as Escherichia coli must tolerate {{high levels}} of bile salts, powerful detergents that disrupt biological membranes. The outer membrane barrier of gram-negative bacteria {{plays an important role}} in this resistance, but ultimately it can only retard the influx of bile salts. We therefore examined whether E. coli possessed an energy-dependent efflux mechanism for these compounds. Intact cells of E. coli K- 12 appeared to pump out chenodeoxycholate, since its intracellular accumulation increased more than twofold upon <b>deenergization</b> of the cytoplasmic membrane by a proton conductor. Growth inhibition by bile salts and accumulation levels of chenodeoxycholate increased when mutations inactivating the acrAB and emrAB gene clusters were introduced. The AcrAB system especially appeared to play a significant role in bile acid efflux. However, another efflux system(s) also plays an important role, since the accumulation level of chenodeoxycholate increased strongly upon <b>deenergization</b> of acrA emrB double mutant cells. Everted membrane vesicles accumulated taurocholate in an energy-dependent manner, apparently consuming delta pH without affecting delta psi. The efflux thus appears to be catalyzed by a proton antiporter. Accumulation by the everted membrane vesicles was not decreased by mutations in acr and emrB genes and presumably reflects activity of the unknown system seen in intact cells. It followed saturation kinetics with Vmax and Km values in the neighborhood of 0. 3 nmol min(- 1) mg of protein(- 1) and 50 microM, respectively...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn potato tuber mitochondria, ATPase deactivates {{immediately}} after treatment with an uncoupler or with polyoxyethylene 9 -lauryl ether (Lubrol), a non-ionic detergent. Deactivation was completely prevented by another non-ionic detergent, lauryldimethylamine oxide (LDAO). LDAO also induced slow reactivation of inactive ATPase formed in deenergized mitochondria. Freezing {{of the active}} state by LDAO was used to study the process of ATPase deactivation following <b>deenergization</b> in intact mitochondria. Deactivation was slowed down by carboxyatractyloside (CATR), which prevents ATP import into the matrix, and by ATPase inhibitors. ATP hydrolysis was also triggered by Lubrol with CATR-treated mitochondria. The initial rate {{was close to the}} capacity for ATP synthesis but rapidly decayed. The rate of decay increased with the concentration of MgATP and no decay was observed in the presence of EDTA. The following conclusions were drawn. (1) <b>Deenergization</b> in itself is not sufficient for ATPase deactivation in plant mitochondria: enzyme turnover is also required. The probability of one enzyme to be deactivated at each turnover is much higher in potato tuber than in pea leaf organelles. (2) Enzyme turnover probably shifts the IF 1 -F 1 complex from an active to an inactive form; the rate of deactivation indeed {{does not seem to be}} controlled by the binding of the inhibitory peptide.

40|$|Apoptosis is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved form of physiologic {{cell death}} important for tissue development and homeostasis. The causes and execution mechanisms of apoptosis {{are not completely}} understood. Nitric oxide (NO) and its congeners, oxidative stress, Ca 2 +, proteases, nucleases, and mitochondria are considered mediators of apoptosis. Recent findings strongly suggest that mitochondria contain a factor or factors that upon release from the destabilized organelles, induce apoptosis. We have found that oxidative stress-induced release of Ca 2 + from mitochondria followed by Ca 2 + reuptake (Ca 2 + cycling) causes destabilization of mitochondria and apoptosis. The protein product of the protooncogene bcl- 2 protects mitochondria and thereby prevents apoptosis. We have also found that NO and its congeners can induce Ca 2 + release from mitochondria. Thus, nitrogen monoxide (. NO) binds to cytochrome oxidase, blocks respiration, and thereby causes mitochondrial <b>deenergization</b> and Ca 2 + release. Peroxynitrite (ONOO-), on the other hand, causes Ca 2 + release from mitochondria by stimulating a specific Ca 2 + release pathway. This pathway requires oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) hydrolysis to adenosine diphosphate ribose and nicotinamide. NAD+ hydrolysis is only possible when some vicinal thiols are cross-linked. ONOO- is able to oxidize them. Our findings suggest that NO and its congeners can induce apoptosis by destabilizing mitochondria via <b>deenergization</b> and/or by inducing a specific Ca 2 + release followed by Ca 2 + cycling...|$|E

We demonstrate that this general phenomenon {{takes place in the}} case of transformed (glioma C 6 and Ehrlich ascites tumor cells) as well as non-transformed (human fibroblasts) cells.

In a parallel experiment, the rotation was not affected by inclusion of an ATP trap (hexokinase and glucose) within the envelopes. It is concluded that arsenate affects the motor in a way other than reversible <b>deenergization.</b> This may be an irreversible damage to the cell or direct inhibition of the motor by arsenate.

40|$|Resistance to {{tetracycline}} (Tcr) {{mediated by}} Tn 10 and related Tcr determinants involves an inner membrane protein, TET (similar but not identical for different determinants), and a proton motive force-dependent efflux of tetracycline which keeps the drug {{away from its}} intracellular target, the ribosome (L. M. McMurry, R. E. Petrucci, Jr., and S. B. Levy, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 : 3974 - 3977, 1980). However, the amount of tetracycline accumulated by bacteria does not always correlate with their resistance levels, suggesting that an additional resistance mechanism may be present. When we permeabilized susceptible and resistant Tn 10 -bearing cells with toluene, we found that protein synthesis in the two strains became equally sensitive to tetracycline. Therefore, the protein synthesis machinery was not a source of resistance, and an intact membrane was required for resistance. To determine whether resistance was entirely dependent on energy, we measured susceptibility to tetracycline after inhibition of proton motive force by starvation and specific inhibitors. An 80 to 90 % loss of Tcr (measured by protein synthesis) resulted from partial <b>deenergization</b> of resistant cells. A remaining resistance (10 - to 20 -fold {{greater than that of}} susceptible cells) could not be eliminated by further <b>deenergization.</b> These findings indicated that, to a major extent, expression of Tn 10 resistance required energy, presumably for tetracycline efflux. They also suggested the existence of a small component of Tcr having little or no energy dependence. Whether this component depends on tetracycline efflux or some other mechanism is not known, but presumably both high- and low-energy components of resistance reflect activity of TET protein...|$|E

Since specific blockers of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channel prevented both types of cell death, the role of Ca 2 +-dependent processes in the initiation of glutamate toxicity was further investigated. We examined the possible involvement of mitochondria {{and the role of}} the Ca 2 +/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase, calcineurin, in the development of either type of cell death. Cyclosporin A and the more selective calcineurin inhibitor, FK- 506, prevented the development of both early necrosis and delayed apoptosis. In addition, cyclosporin A prevented the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential observed during the exposure to glutamate and the concomitant necrotic phase. When CsA was added immediately after glutamate removal, it also prevented delayed apoptosis of neurons that had survived the necrotic phase. Altogether, these results suggest the involvement of calcineurin and a role for mitochondrial <b>deenergization</b> as early signals in neuronal apoptosis induced by glutamate...|$|E

Pediocin PA- 1, leuconocin S, and lactacin F acted in an energy-independent manner, whereas the activity of nisin was confirmed to be energy dependent.

Oligomycin slowed down ATP loss in thymocytes, but not in EAC cells. Thus, mitochondrial ATP hydrolysis appears to be significant in deenergized thymocytes in contrast to EAC cells, in which other ATP consuming reactions were prevailing. Complete <b>deenergization</b> of mitochondria by uncoupler or rotenone in these cells resulted in inactivation of mitochondrial ATPase by 65 – 75 %. The effect was observed after complete and rapid (20 – 30 s) disruption of the cells with detergent, Lubrol WX. ATPase was blocked by the specific inhibitor protein (IF 1) as it was shown by the studies on reactivation of this enzyme. When respiration is blocked but ATP content is supported by glycolysis, mitochondrial ATPase is not suppressed by IF 1, and maintains the energization of mitochondria. It is concluded that under complete de-energization of mitochondria IF 1, significantly inhibits mitochondrial ATP hydrolysis and may slow down ATP loss in thymocytes and EAC cells...|$|E

For this purpose the cells had to be deenergized first. Conventional <b>deenergization</b> procedures caused irreversible loss of motility, presumably due to ATP-dependent degradative processes. However, E. coli cells deenergized by incubation with arsenate manifested a slow, reversible depletion of PMF. In this procedure there was a sufficiently long time window, during which a considerable proportion of the cells lost their motility and could be made to rotate again by an artificially-imposed PMF. The motors of these cells rotated in response to any PMF polarity, but positive and negative polarities rotated different sub-populations of cells and the direction was almost exclusively counterclockwise. The reason for the unidirectionality of the rotation was not the intervention of the chemotaxis system. A number of potential reasons are suggested. One is the arsenate effect on the motor function found previously [Margolin, Y., Barak, R. and Eisenbach, M. (1994) J. Bacteriol. 176, 5547 – 5549].

Pinene also inhibited the pumping of protons and K+ transport, but this inhibition was more marked with with ethanol than with glucose as the substrate, indicating the mitochondrial localization of the inhibition. The studies on isolated mitochondria showed a series of effects, starting with the disappearance of the respiratory control and <b>deenergization</b> of the organelles and followed by an inhibition of respiration at higher concentrations of the terpene. The effect on respiration could be localized to the cytochrome b region of the electron transport chain. No effect could be detected on the activity of ATPase.

The toxin was bound selectively to the neuromuscular junction, and at concentrations similar to those {{likely to be found}} in the circulation of young bite victims, it blocked the response of the muscle to indirect but not direct stimulation. Electron microscopy showed that the toxin induced a small but insignificant depletion of synaptic vesicles from motor nerve terminals; nerve terminal mitochondria were swollen and damaged, but plasma membranes of terminal boutons were undamaged. Exposure to the toxin did not affect postjunctional acetylcholine receptors or cause structural damage to preterminal motor axons or muscle fibers. Spontaneous transmitter release was similarly unaffected. Taken together, these results indicate that ammodytoxin A is the principal agent involved in the neurotoxic activity of the venom of V ammodytes ammodytes and that the underlying cause of the failure of transmission may be the <b>deenergization</b> of the nerve terminal resulting from mitochondrial degeneration and subsequent impairment of coupling between the action-potential-induced depolarization of the nerve terminal and the evoked transmitter release.

In the present study, the conclusion concerning the efflux activity of this system was confirmed and extended by the measurement of drug accumulation in intact cells. Thus, the steady-state accumulation levels of tetracycline and norfloxacin were increased in mexA and oprM null mutants. mexA and oprM null mutants also showed an increase in susceptibility {{to a wide variety of}} beta-lactam antibiotics and an increase in the steady-state accumulation level of benzylpenicillin, indicating that the MexA-MexB-OprM pump also effluxes beta-lactams. Furthermore, <b>deenergization</b> of the cytoplasmic membrane with a proton conductor always produced a strong increase in the accumulation level. Finally, a single-step mutant over-producing MexAB-OprM accumulated less tetracycline and chloramphenicol than the parent strain and was more resistant to a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, including beta-lactams.

40|$|Evidence {{obtained}} {{over the}} past two decades shows that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in brain lesions, including those due to cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. The mitochondria are the primary intracellular source of ROS, as they generate huge numbers of oxidative-reduction reactions and use massive amounts of oxygen. When anoxia is followed promptly by reperfusion, the resulting increase in oxygen supply leads to overproduction of ROS. In ischemic tissues, numerous studies have established a direct role for ROS in oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Thus, mitochondria are both the initiator and the first target of oxidative stress. Mitochondrial damage can lead to cell death, given the role for mitochondria in energy metabolism and calcium homeostasis, as well as the ability of mitochondria to release pro-apoptotic factors such as cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). This review discusses possible mitochondrion-targeted strategies for preventing ROS-induced injury during reperfusion. The sequence of events that follow oxidative damage provides the outline for the review: thus, we will discuss protection of oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial membrane integrity and fluidity, and antioxidant or mild-uncoupling strategies for diminishing ROS production. Among mechanisms of action, we will describe the modulation of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening, which may not only operate as a physiological Ca(2 +) release mechanism, but also contribute to mitochondrial <b>deenergization,</b> release of pro-apoptotic proteins, and protection by ischemic preconditioning (IPC).

The transmembrane pH gradient and ATP levels were restored once the immobilized cells had almost completely degraded the PCP in the perfusion medium. PCP-pretreated cells, on the other hand, maintained their transmembrane pH gradient and ATP levels even in the presence of high levels of PCP. The ability of PCP-pretreated strain UG 25 and UG 30 cells to remain energized in the presence of PCP was shown to correlate with an altered membrane phospholipid profile; these cells had a higher concentration of cardiolipin than cells cultured in the absence of PCP. Strain ATCC 39723, which did not degrade higher levels of PCP after PCP pretreatment, did not show this response...|$|E
40|$|The {{overexpression}} of Bax kills cells by {{a mechanism}} {{that depends on}} induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) (Pastorino, J. G., Chen, S. -T., Tafani, M., Snyder, J. W., and Farber, J. L. (1998) J. Biol Chem. 273, 7770 - 7775). In the present study, purified, recombinant Bax opened the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). Depending on its concentration, Bax had two distinct effects. Al a concentration of 125 nM, Bax caused {{the release of the}} intermembranous proteins cytochrome c and adenylate kinase and the release from the matrix of sequestered calcein, effects prevented by the inhibitor of the PTP cyclosporin A (CSA), AL this concentration of Bax, there was no detectable mitochondrial swelling or depolarization. These effects of low Bax concentrations are interpreted as the consequence of transient, non-synchronous activation of the PTP followed by a prompt recovery of mitochondrial integrity, By contrast, Bax concentrations between 250 nM and 1 mu M caused a sustained opening of the PTP with consequent persistent mitochondrial swelling and <b>deenergization</b> (the MPT). CSA prevented the RIFT induced by fax, Increasing concentrations of calcium caused a greater proportion of the mitochondrial to undergo the MPT in the presence of Bax. Importantly, two known mediators of apoptosis, ceramide and GD 3 ganglioside, potentiated the induction by Bax of the MPT, The data imply that Bax mediates the opening of the mitochondrial PTP with the resultant release of cytochrome c from the intermembranous space...|$|E

Nevertheless, the maintenance of OWFs is a significant issue due to accessibility and repair costs. Thus, the protection of OWFs electrical components should be investigated in various operation conditions such as energization, <b>deenergization</b> as well as lightning strikes to the blade of wind turbines. In this paper, the overvoltages due to energization are simulated and the impact of surge arresters and capacitive filters to protect wind turbine components is analyzed. Modeling of the components in OWF is considered based upon their frequency behavior. The significant components for energization studies are interconnecting cables, Wind Turbine Transformers (WTTs), surge arresters, vacuum circuit breakers as well. For modeling the cables, JMarti model is applied and model frequency is modified based on cable length. WTTs as the heart of wind farms are modeled based on vector fitting and transformer terminal measurements. Surge arresters as the main overvoltage protector is modeled considering stray lead inductances which degrade the efficiency of the surges arresters in reality. Simulation results indicate that energizing a row of OWF is actually similar to a ladder cables-transformers energization which LV terminal of transformers should be considered no load. The overvoltages in LV can reach up to 10 - 15 p. u. if surge arresters and capacitive filters are not installed. By the application of surge arresters and capacitive filters, the overvoltage peak and rate of rise of overvoltage (dU/dt) can be respectively controlled...|$|E
40|$|Electronic energy —resulting {{either from}} {{electron}} excitation or localization — is the obligatory {{link between the}} different forms of energy (light, redox, acid-base, metahosphate-ortophosphate) transducible by biochemical systems. The key in energy coupling between any two transducing systems lies precisely {{in the fact that}} both of them share a common intermediate that cyclically participates in the overall transduction process by alternating between its electronically energized state and its unenergized basal state. All the energy-transducing biochemical systems must operate, according to their nature and character of the energization, at two midpoint redox potentials, at two pKa's, or at two phosphate transfer potentials. Three basic energy-transducing systems in bioenergetics, namely, redox, acid-base and metaphosphate- ortophosphate, couple between them through the acylium cation [R-C= 0]**— carboxylate anion (R—COO") pair. These forms are, respectively, twice-energized and unenergized and can accept, at two energy levels, either two electrons or two protons or the ortophosphate anion (H 2 PO 4 ") and the "zwitterion" metaphosphate (~PÕ 3 "**). Both at the substrate level and at the membrane level, ortophosphate energization to metaphosphate, by removal of an oxide anion (02 ~), brings about a decrease in pKa with the concomitant dissociation of the two protons (2 Ht), whereas <b>deenergization</b> of metaphosphate to ortophosphate, by addition of an oxide anion, brings about an increase in pKa with the concomitant fixation of two protons. One of the greatest discoveries of bioenergetics was the introduction in cell metabolism of the one-electron redox photosystem chlorophyll a and was followed by the starting of the one-electron/one-proton redox/acid-base energytransducing systems of the photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chains...|$|E
40|$|Cyclophilin d (cypD) -deficient mice exhibit {{resistance}} to focal cerebral ischemia and to necrotic but not apoptotic stimuli. To address this disparity, we investigated isolated brain and in situ neuronal and astrocytic mitochondria from cypD-deficient and wild-type mice. Isolated mitochondria were challenged by high Ca 2 +, {{and the effects}} of substrates and respiratory chain inhibitors were evaluated on permeability transition pore opening by light scatter. In situ neuronal and astrocytic mitochondria were visualized by mito-DsRed 2 targeting and challenged by calcimycin, {{and the effects of}} glucose, NaCN, and an uncoupler were evaluated by measuring mitochondrial volume. In isolated mitochondria, Ca 2 + caused a large cypD-dependent change in light scatter in the absence of substrates that was insensitive to Ruthenium red or Ru 360. Uniporter inhibitors only partially affected the entry of free Ca 2 + in the matrix. Inhibition of complex III/IV negated the effect of substrates, but inhibition of complex I was protective. Mitochondria within neurons and astrocytes exhibited cypD-independent swelling that was dramatically hastened when NaCN and 2 -deoxyglucose were present in a glucose-free medium during calcimycin treatment. In the presence of an uncoupler, cypD-deficient astrocytic mitochondria performed better than wild-type mitochondria, whereas the opposite was observed in neurons. Neuronal mitochondria were examined further during glutamate-induced delayed Ca 2 + deregulation. CypD-knock-out mitochondria exhibited an absence or a delay in the onset of mitochondrial swelling after glutamate application. Apparently, some conditions involving <b>deenergization</b> render cypD an important modulator of PTP in the brain. These findings could explain why absence of cypD protects against necrotic (deenergized mitochondria), but not apoptotic (energized mitochondria) stimuli...|$|E

40|$|Context: Ischemia-reperfusion {{injury is}} a {{fascinating}} topic which has drawn {{a lot of interest}} in the last several years. Hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury may occur in a variety of clinical situations. These include transplantation, liver resection, trauma, and vascular surgery. Evidence Acquisition: The purpose of this review was to outline the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic I/R injury and present the latest approaches, both surgical and pharmacological, regarding the prevention of it. A comprehensive electronic literature search in MEDLINE/PubMed was performed to identify relative articles published within the last 2 years. Results: The basic mechanism of hepatic ischemia – reperfusion injury is one of blood deprivation during ischemia, followed by the return of flow during reperfusion. It involves a complex series of events, such as mitochondrial <b>deenergization,</b> adenosine- 5 '-triphosphate depletion, alterations of electrolyte homeostasis, as well as Kupffer cell activation, oxidative stress changes and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine signaling. The great number of variable pathways, with several mediators interacting with each other, leads to a high number of candidates for potential therapeutic intervention. As far as surgical approaches are concerned, the modification of existing clamping techniques and the ischemic preconditioning are the most promising techniques till recently. In the search for novel techniques of protecting against hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury, many different strategies have been used in experimental models. The biggest part of this research lies around antioxidant therapy, but other potential solutions have been explored as well. Conclusions: The management of hepatic trauma, in spite of the fact that it has become increasingly nonoperative, there still remains the possibility of hepatic resection in the hepatic trauma setting, especially in severe injuries. Hence, clinicians should be familiar with the concept of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury and respond appropriately and timely...|$|E
40|$|Treatment {{of growing}} Escherichia coli B with {{lanthanide}} ions [lanthanum(III), terbium(III), and europium(III) ] and subsequent aldehyde-OsO 4 fixation caused areas {{of high contrast}} to appear within the periplasm (the space between inner and outer membrane of the cell envelope). X-ray microanalysis of ultrathin sections of Epon-embedded or acrylic resin-embedded cells revealed {{the presence of the}} lanthanide and of phosphorus in the areas, whose contrast greatly exceeded that of other stained structures. Comparatively small amounts of the lanthanide were also present in the outer membrane and in the cytoplasm. The distribution of the periplasmic areas of high contrast was found to be random and not clustered at areas of current or future septum formation. Irregular cell shapes were observed after lanthanide treatment before onset of fixation. In contrast to glutaraldehyde-OsO 4 fixation, glutaraldehyde used as the sole fixer caused a scattered distribution of the lanthanide. Cryofixation (slam-freezing) and freeze substitution revealed a lanthanum stain at both the periplasm and the outer part of the outer membrane. <b>Deenergization</b> of the cell membrane by either phage T 4 or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone abolished the metal accumulation. Furthermore, addition of excess calcium, administered together with the lanthanide solution, diminished the quantity and size of areas of high contrast. Cells grown in media of high NaCl concentration revealed strongly stained areas of periplasmic precipitates, whereas cells grown under low-salt conditions showed very few high-contrast patches in the periplasm. Terbium treatment (during fixation) enhanced the visibility of the sites of inner-outer membrane contact (the membrane adhesion sites) in plasmolized cells, possibly as the result of an accumulation of the metal at the adhesion domains. The data suggest a rapid interaction of the lanthanides with components of the cell envelope, the periplasm, and the energized inner membrane...|$|E
