40|$|On solid media, the {{reproductive}} growth of Streptomyces involves antibiotic biosynthesis coincident with the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> filamentous <b>aerial</b> hyphae. Following cessation of growth <b>of</b> an <b>aerial</b> hypha, multiple septation {{occurs at the}} tip to form a chain of unigenomic spores. A gene, crgA, that coordinates several aspects of this reproductive growth is described. The gene product is representative of a well-conserved family of small actinomycete proteins with two C-terminal hydrophobic-potential membrane-spanning segments. In Streptomyces avermitilis, crgA is required for sporulation, and inactivation of the gene abolished most sporulation septation in <b>aerial</b> hyphae. Disruption <b>of</b> the orthologous gene in Streptomyces coelicolor indicates that whereas CrgA is not essential for sporulation in this species, during growth on glucose-containing media, it influences {{the timing of the}} onset of reproductive growth, with precocious <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> <b>aerial</b> hyphae and antibiotic production by the mutant. Moreover, CrgA subsequently acts to inhibit sporulation septation prior to growth arrest <b>of</b> <b>aerial</b> hyphae. Overexpression <b>of</b> CrgA in S. coelicolor, uncoupling any nutritional and growth phase-dependent regulation, results in growth <b>of</b> nonseptated <b>aerial</b> hyphae on all media tested, consistent with a role for the protein in inhibiting sporulation septation...|$|R
40|$|The complex {{life cycle}} of streptomycetes {{involves}} two distinct filamentous cell forms: the growing (or vegetative) hyphae and the reproductive (or aerial) hyphae, which differentiate into long chains of spores. Until recently, little was known about the signalling pathways that regulate the developmental transitions leading to sporulation. In this Review, we discuss important new insights into these pathways {{that have led to}} the emergence of a coherent regulatory network, focusing on the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> <b>aerial</b> hyphae and the synchronous cell division event that produces dozens of unigenomic spores. In particular, we highlight the role of cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) in controlling the initiation of development, {{and the role of the}} master regulator BldD in mediating c-di-GMP signalling...|$|R
40|$|The {{filamentous}} bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor {{undergoes a}} complex process of morphological differentiation involving {{the formation of a}} dense lawn <b>of</b> <b>aerial</b> hyphae that grow away from the colony surface into the air to form an aerial mycelium, Bald mutants of S, coelicolor, which are blocked in aerial mycelium formation, regain the capacity to erect aerial structures when exposed to a small hydrophobic protein called SapB, whose synthesis is temporally and spatially correlated with morphological differentiation. We now report that SapB is a surfactant that is capable of reducing the surface tension of water from 72 mJ m(- 2) to 30 mJ m(- 2) at a concentration of 50 mu g ml(- 1) We also report that SapB, like the surface-active peptide streptofactin produced by the species S. tendae, was capable of restoring the capacity of bald mutants of S. tendae to erect aerial structures. Strikingly, a member (SC 3) of the hydrophobin family of fungal proteins involved in the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> <b>aerial</b> hyphae in the filamentous fungus Schizophyllum commune was also capable of restoring the capacity of S, coelicolor and S, tendae bald mutants to erect aerial structures. SC 3 is unrelated in structure to SapB and streptofactin but, like the streptomycetes proteins, the fungal protein is a surface active agent. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that aerial structures produced in response to both the bacterial or the fungal proteins were undifferentiated vegetative hyphae that had grown away from the colony surface but had not commenced the process of spore formation, We conclude that the production of SapB and streptofactin at the start of morphological differentiation contributes to the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> <b>aerial</b> hyphae by decreasing the surface tension at the colony surface but that subsequent morphogenesis requires additional developmentally regulated events under the control of bald genes...|$|R

40|$|Filamentous fungi and {{filamentous}} bacteria (i. e., the streptomycetes) belong to different kingdoms that diverged early in evolution, Yet, they adopted similar lifestyles, After a submerged feeding mycelium has been established, hyphae grow {{into the air}} and form aerial structures from which (a) sexual spores can develop. These spores are dispersed and can give rise to a new mycelium, Some of the key processes involved in the formation <b>of</b> <b>aerial</b> hyphae by these microbes appear to be very similar, In both cases molecules that lower the surface tension are secreted into the aqueous environment, thereby enabling hyphae to grow into the air. Aerial hyphae are then covered with a hydrophobic film, In fungi, this film is characterized by a mosaic of parallel rodlets, while similar rodlets have also been observed on <b>aerial</b> structures <b>of</b> {{filamentous bacteria}}, Although the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> <b>aerial</b> hyphae in both filamentous fungi and filamentous bacteria is dependent upon (poly) peptides that are structurally unrelated, they can, at least partially, functionally substitute for each other.

40|$|The fluid mosaic {{model has}} {{recently}} been amended {{to account for the}} existence of membrane domains enriched in certain phospholipids. In rod-shaped bacteria, the anionic phospholipid cardiolipin is enriched at the cell poles but its role in the morphogenesis of the filamentous bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor is unknown. It was impossible to delete clsA (cardiolipin synthase; SCO 1389) unless complemented by a second copy of clsA elsewhere in the chromosome. When placed under the control of an inducible promoter, clsA expression, phospholipid profile and morphogenesis became inducer dependent. TLC analysis of phospholipid showed altered profiles upon depletion of clsA expression. Analysis of cardiolipin by mass spectrometry showed two distinct cardiolipin envelopes that reflected differences in acyl chain length; the level of the larger cardiolipin envelope was reduced in concert with clsA expression. ClsA-EGFP did not localize to specific locations, but cardiolipin itself showed enrichment at hyphal tips, branch points and anucleate regions. Quantitative analysis of hyphal dimensions showed that the mycelial architecture and the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> <b>aerial</b> hyphae were affected by the expression of clsA. Overexpression of clsA resulted in weakened hyphal tips, misshaped aerial hyphae and anucleate spores and demonstrates that cardiolipin synthesis is a requirement for morphogenesis in Streptomyces...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria {{from the}} genus Streptomyces {{are among the}} most complex of all prokaryotes; not only do they grow as a complex mycelium, they also {{differentiate}} to form aerial hyphae before developing further to form spore chains. This developmental heterogeneity of streptomycete microcolonies makes studying the dynamic processes that contribute to growth and development a challenging procedure. As a result, in order to study the mechanisms that underpin streptomycete growth, we have developed a system for studying hyphal extension, protein trafficking, and sporulation by time-lapse microscopy. Through the use of time-lapse microscopy we have demonstrated that Streptomyces coelicolor germ tubes undergo a temporary arrest in their growth when in close proximity to sibling extension sites. Following germination, in this system, hyphae extended at a rate of ∼ 20 μm h− 1, which was not significantly different from {{the rate at which the}} apical ring of the cytokinetic protein FtsZ progressed along extending hyphae through a spiraling movement. Although we were able to generate movies for streptomycete sporulation, we were unable to do so for either the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> <b>aerial</b> hyphae or the early stages of sporulation. Despite this, it was possible to demonstrate an arrest <b>of</b> <b>aerial</b> hyphal development that we suggest is through the depolymerization of FtsZ-enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP). Consequently, the imaging system reported here provides a system that allows the dynamic movement of GFP-tagged proteins involved in growth and development of S. coelicolor to be tracked and their role in cytokinesis to be characterized during the streptomycete life cycle...|$|R
40|$|The amf {{gene cluster}} encodes a {{probable}} secretion {{system for a}} peptidic morphogen, AmfS, which induces aerial mycelium formation in Streptomyces griseus. Here we examined the transcriptional control mechanism for the promoter preceding amfT (PamfT) directing the transcription of the amfTSBA operon. High-resolution S 1 analysis mapped a transcriptional start point at 31 nucleotides upstream of the translational start codon of amfT. Low-resolution analysis showed that PamfT is developmentally regulated in the wild type and completely abolished in an amfR mutant. The − 35 region of PamfT contained the consensus sequence for the binding of BldD, a pleiotropic negative regulator for morphological and physiological development in Streptomyces coelicolor A 3 (2). The cloned bldD locus of S. griseus showed high sequence similarity to the S. coelicolor counterpart. Transcription of bldD occurred constitutively in both the wild type and an A-factor-deficient mutant of S. griseus, {{which suggests that the}} regulatory role of BldD is independent of A-factor. The gel retardation assay revealed that purified BldD and AmfR recombinant proteins specifically bind PamfT. Overproduction of BldD in the wild-type cell conferred a bald phenotype (defective in aerial growth and streptomycin production) and caused marked repression of PamfT activity. An amfT-depleted mutant also showed a bald phenotype but PamfT activity was not affected. Both the bldD-overproducing wild-type strain and the amfT mutant were unable to induce <b>aerial</b> growth <b>of</b> an amfS mutant in a cross-feeding assay, which indicates that these strains are defective in the production of an active AmfS peptide. The results overall suggests that two independent regulators, AmfR and BldD, control PamfT activity via direct binding to determine the transcriptional level of the amf operon responsible for the production and secretion of AmfS peptide, which induces the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> <b>aerial</b> hyphae in S. griseus...|$|R
