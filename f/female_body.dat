5|$|His {{forms are}} usually abstractions {{of the human}} figure, {{typically}} depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures. Moore's works are usually suggestive of the <b>female</b> <b>body,</b> apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces. Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace, Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of the {{clitoris}} {{is significantly}} impacted by cultural {{perceptions of the}} organ. Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant in comparison with that of other sexual organs, and that more education about it could help alleviate social stigmas associated with the <b>female</b> <b>body</b> and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and vulva in general are visually unappealing, that female masturbation is taboo, or that men {{should be expected to}} master and control women's orgasms.|$|E
5|$|Andreacarus voalavo is a {{parasitic}} mite {{found on}} the Malagasy rodent Voalavo gymnocaudus. First described in 2007, it {{is closely related to}} Andreacarus gymnuromys and Andreacarus eliurus, which are found on other Malagasy rodents. The length of the idiosoma, the main body, is 630 to 670μm in females and 450 to 480μm in males. Unlike A.eliurus, this species lacks distinct sternal glands (secretory organs) between two lyrifissures (sensory organs) on {{the lower part of the}} <b>female</b> <b>body.</b> The pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the chelicera, is serrate, which distinguishes it from A.gymnuromys. Females of A.gymnuromys also have a less ornamented sternal shield (covering part of the underparts) and shorter setae (bristles) on the upperparts.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that sexualized <b>female</b> <b>bodies</b> are {{objectified}} at a cognitive level. Research using the body-inversion recognition task, a robust indicator of configural (vs. analytic processing) within cognitive psychology, shows that for sexualized <b>female</b> <b>bodies,</b> people recognize upright and inverted bodies similarly rather than recognizing upright bodies better than inverted bodies (i. e. an inversion effect). This finding suggests that sexualized <b>female</b> <b>bodies,</b> like objects, are recognized analytically (rather than configurally). Nonetheless, it remains unclear when and why sexualized <b>female</b> <b>bodies</b> are objectified at a basic cognitive level. Grounded in objectification theory, the present experiments examine moderating factors that may prompt more configural processing (i. e. produce an inversion effect) and less objectification of sexualized <b>female</b> <b>bodies.</b> Replicating previous research, sexualized male bodies elicited more configural processing and less objectification compared to sexualized <b>female</b> <b>bodies.</b> We then examined whether reducing the salience of sexual body parts (Experiments 2 a and 2 b) and adding humanizing information about the targets (Experiment 3) causes perceivers to recognize <b>female</b> <b>bodies</b> more configurally, reducing the cognitive objectification of women. Implications for sexual objectification theory and research, as well as the role of humanizing often-dehumanized sexy women, are discussed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|At {{an early}} stage of visual processing, human faces and bodies are {{typically}} associated with larger N 170 s when presented in an inverted (vs. upright) position, indexing the involvement of configural processing. We challenged this view and hypothesized that sexualized bodies would not be sensitive to inversion, thereby suggesting that they would be processed similarly to objects. Participants saw sexualized male and <b>female</b> <b>bodies,</b> nonsexualized male and <b>female</b> <b>bodies,</b> as well as objects in both upright and inverted positions while we recorded the N 170. Results indicated that inverted (vs. upright) nonsexualized male and <b>female</b> <b>bodies</b> were associated with larger N 170 amplitudes. In contrast, no N 170 amplitude inversion effect emerged for sexualized male and <b>female</b> <b>bodies</b> or objects. These results suggest that sexualized bodies are processed similarly to objects and quite differently than nonsexualized bodies. We discuss the results and their implications {{in the light of the}} literatures in person perception and objectification. info:eu-repo/semantics/inPres...|$|R
5|$|Gabbar Singh, the film's antagonist, {{was well}} {{received}} by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty. Dissanayake explains that the audience {{was fascinated by the}} dialogues and mannerisms of the character, and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions, a first for Indian melodrama. He notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited. He further notes that, unlike earlier melodramas in which the <b>female</b> <b>body</b> occupies the audience's attention as an object of male fetish, in Sholay, the male body becomes the centrepiece. It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy. Dissanayake argues that Sholay {{can be viewed as a}} national allegory: it lacks a comforting logical narrative, it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged, and it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions. Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India. The narrative style of Sholay, with its violence, revenge, and vigilante action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release. This tension culminated in the Emergency (rule by decree) declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Eric Morley {{organized}} the Festival Bikini Contest, a beauty contest and swimwear advertising opportunity at that year's Festival of Britain. The press, welcoming the spectacle, {{referred to it}} as Miss World, a name Morley registered as a trademark. The winner was Kiki Håkansson of Sweden, who was crowned in a bikini. After the crowning, Håkansson was condemned by Pope Pius XII, while Spain and Ireland threatened to withdraw from the pageant. In 1952, bikinis were banned from the pageant and replaced by evening gowns. As a result of the controversy, the bikini was explicitly banned from many other beauty pageants worldwide. Though some regarded the bikini and beauty contests as bringing freedom to women, they were opposed by some feminists as well as religious and cultural groups who objected to the degree of exposure of the <b>female</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Bruce Bagemihl's {{survey of}} The Zoological Record (1978–1997)– which {{contains}} {{over a million}} documents from over 6,000 scientific journals– 539 articles focusing on the penis were found, while 7 were found focusing on the clitoris. In 2000, researchers Shirley Ogletree and Harvey Ginsberg concluded {{that there is a}} general neglect of the word clitoris in common vernacular. They looked at the terms used to describe genitalia in the PsycINFO database from 1887 to 2000 and found that penis was used in 1,482 sources, vagina in 409, while clitoris was only mentioned in 83. They additionally analyzed 57 books listed in a computer database for sex instruction. In the majority of the books, penis was the most commonly discussed body part– mentioned more than clitoris, vagina, and uterus put together. They last investigated terminology used by college students, ranging from Euro-American (76%/76%), Hispanic (18%/14%), and African American (4%/7%), regarding the students' beliefs about sexuality and knowledge on the subject. The students were overwhelmingly educated to believe that the vagina is the female counterpart of the penis. The authors found that the students' belief that the inner portion of the vagina is the most sexually sensitive part of the <b>female</b> <b>body</b> correlated with negative attitudes toward masturbation and strong support for sexual myths.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been many debates about fat <b>female</b> <b>bodies</b> in the media. Fat women are often {{associated}} with moral failure, laziness and stupidity. Women’s fat bodies are loaded with negative meanings because of dominant negative attitudes.

In this study, i will show how fat <b>female</b> <b>bodies</b> are being discussed on Flashback forum. I’m using a gender and intersectionalitative perspective. Anti-feminists uses Flashback forum to express sexist, homophobic and racist comments about different authors of feminist and body-positive blogs.
