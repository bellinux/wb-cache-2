40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{population}} densities in coastal areas have strongly increased. At the same time, many <b>intertidal</b> coastal <b>ecosystems</b> that provide valuable services {{in terms of}} coastal protection have greatly degraded. As a result, coastal defense has become increasingly dependent on man-made engineering solutions. Ongoing climate change processes such as sea-level rise and increased storminess, require a rethinking of current coastal defense practices including the development of innovative and cost-effective ways to protect coastlines. Integrating <b>intertidal</b> coastal <b>ecosystems</b> within coastal defense schemes offers a promising way forward. In this perspective, we specifically aim to (1) provide insight in {{the conditions under which}} ecosystems may be valuable for coastal protection, (2) discuss which might be the most promising <b>intertidal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> for this task and (3) identify knowledge gaps that currently hamper application and hence need attention from the scientific community. Ecosystems can contribute most to coastal protection by wave attenuation in areas with relatively small tidal amplitudes, and/or where intertidal areas are wide. The main knowledge gap hampering application of <b>intertidal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> within coastal defense schemes is lack in ability to account quantitatively for long-term ecosystem dynamics. Such knowledge is essential, as this will determine both the predictability and reliability of their coastal defense function.

The bioconcentration factor ranking for trace metals was found to follow the Zn>Ni>Pb>Cr>Cd sequence. The high biota to sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) found for L. exarata reveals a sentinel metal bioindicator. Sediments from most sites were found to be uncontaminated to moderately contaminated (geoaccumulation, Igeo> 0), with Cd and Zn associated with anthropogenic intrusions. Low mean-ERM (effect range-median) and mean-PEL (probable effect level) quotients of sediments were found, indicating low–moderate degrees of contamination with 30 % and 21 % probabilities of toxicity.

40|$|From {{long-term}} stratigraphic {{records in}} Pacific Island archaeological sites, researchers have documented alterations to molluskan species richness and abundance, decreases or increases in mollusk shell size and, in rare cases, human foraging {{may have contributed}} to the extirpation of mollusk taxa.

Byssal attachment strength is positively related to the presence of crab and seaduck predators, but variation in several other morphological features is not easily attributable to predators. In addition, I experimentally demonstrate that seastars preferentially consume mussels with uneven shell margins and small crabs preferentially consume thinner-shelled mussels. However, large crabs either have no preference, or consume more thick-shelled mussels. Finally, I review the concepts of keystone species and trait-mediated indirect interactions, and make the case that traitmediated interactions impact the structure and dynamics of the Howe Sound rocky intertidal community...|$|E

Bacterial community composition was analyzed by terminal {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (T-RFLP) of 16 S rRNA genes, and multivariate analyses of T-RFLP data sets were used for comparisons. Results showed that diversity and richness indexes were not able to detect differences among compartments. However, comparisons within the same compartment clearly showed that copper enrichment was associated with changes in the composition of the bacterial communities and revealed that the magnitude of the effect depends on the compartment being considered. In this context, communities from sediments appeared as the most affected by copper enrichment. The present study also demonstrated that intertidal bacterial communities were dominated by Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria and the changes in these communities were mainly due to changes in their relative abundances.

In this dissertation, I employed ecosystem principles to understand these processes in rocky intertidal communities. I specifically examined the roles of sessile invertebrates in mediating the transfers and transformations of carbon and nitrogen in <b>intertidal</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> First, I quantified the links between nearshore pelagic and rocky intertidal systems. By assimilating suspended particulate organic material (seston), mussels and other sessile invertebrates serve as mediators of material exchange from pelagic to benthic ecosystems. I evaluated these trophic linkages along productivity gradients on the coasts of New Zealand and Oregon, which allowed me to address the influences of seston quality and quantity on the growth and ammonium excretion rates of mussels. My results highlight the necessity of simultaneously considering both seston quantity (total organic particulates) and quality (phytoplankton availability) in evaluating benthic-pelagic coupling. Second, I assessed the utilization of invertebrate-excreted ammonium by macroalgae in high-intertidal pools. Sessile invertebrates not only serve as mediators of material transfer into <b>intertidal</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> they also chemically transform that material, converting particulate organic nitrogen, which is unusable by macroalgae, into ammonium, which algae readily assimilate. l showed that especially in high-zone pools, which are isolated from the ocean for 80...|$|R

Comparison of FA composition in ambient sediment (AS), foregut (FG), midgut (MG), hindgut (HG), and faecal pellets (FPs) indicated that marked changes in FA composition occurred during passage through the gut of H. atra and H. leucospilota. Saturated fatty acids (SAFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and branched fatty acids (BrFAs) were significantly higher in FG than in AS, suggesting that both species selectively ingested nutrient rich particles. Significant reduction of SAFAs, MUFAs, PUFAs, and BrFAs occurred in MD and HD, with complete elimination of most PUFAs in FPs.

40|$|Effects of {{predation}} may cascade {{down the}} food web. By alleviating interspecific competition among prey, predators may promote biodiversity, but the precise mechanisms of how predators alter competition have remained elusive. Here {{we report on}} a predator-exclosure experiment carried out in a tropical <b>intertidal</b> <b>ecosystem,</b> providing evidence for a three-level trophic cascade induced by predation by molluscivore Red Knots (Calidris canutus) that affects pore water biogeochemistry. In the exclosures the knots' favorite prey (Dosinia isocardia) became dominant and reduced the individual growth rate in an alternative prey (Loripes lucinalis). Dosinia, a suspension feeder, consumes suspended particulate organic matter (POM), whereas Loripes is a facultative mixotroph, partly living on metabolites produced by sulfur-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria, but also consuming suspended POM. Reduced sulfide concentrations in the exclosures suggest that, without predation on Dosinia, stronger competition for suspended POM forces Loripes to rely on energy produced by endosymbiotic bacteria, thus leading to an enhanced uptake of sulfide from the surrounding pore water. As sulfide is toxic to most organisms, this competition-induced diet shift by Loripes may detoxify the environment, which in turn may facilitate other species.

The final version is available from Springer via [URL] marine hermit crabs are well known for being omnivorous filter feeders, less {{is known about the}} role they may play as active carrion scavengers in <b>intertidal</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Prior studies have revealed that intertidal hermit crabs can be attracted to chemical cues from predated gastropods. Yet their attraction is usually assumed to be driven primarily by the availability of new shells rather than by food. We conducted field experiments to assess hermit crabs’ potential role as generalist carrion scavengers on the California Coast, examining their speed of attraction {{and the size of the}} aggregations they formed in response to chemical cues from freshly smashed gastropods and mussels, both of which indicated available carrion. Compared to all other marine species, hermit crabs (Pagurus samuelis, P. hirsutiusculus, and P. granosimanus) were the fastest to arrive at the provisioning sites. Hermit crabs also dominated the provisioning sites, accumulating in the largest numbers, with aggregations of up to 20 individuals, which outcompeted all other scavengers for carrion. Notably, hermit crabs arrived equally quickly for both smashed gastropod and mussel, even though the latter does not offer suitable shells for hermit crabs and even though the former only yields shell-related chemical cues over time frames longer than our experiments. These results thus suggest that shell availability is not the only, or even the primary, reason marine intertidal hermit crabs aggregate at carrion sites; they also aggregate to forage, thereby playing an important role as active carrion scavengers in <b>intertidal</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Research was supported by funding from the Miller Institute at Berkeley to M.

Estimated MPB PP varied spatially and the distribution is similarly comparable to that of derived clay and sand sediment classes, with high MPB PP found in clay sediments and limited amounts on sand. Sensitivity analysis results have shown that MPB PP in mudflats is largely controlled by αB, euphotic depth and Kd...|$|R
40|$|This {{commentary}} {{describes a}} gap in the qualitative and quantitative knowledge of the provision of benefits to humans from the <b>intertidal</b> <b>ecosystems</b> of the Mediterranean and offers a framework for quantification of the benefits provided by these systems. The identification of such benefits, understanding their spatial distribution and their subsequent quantification will be critical to the design of policy responses to future climate change, sea level rise and seawater acidification. A baseline understanding of the current state of ecosystem functions, {{as well as of the}} provision of related ecosystem services, is therefore needed. Further, researchers must strive to generate forecasts of the changes in these functions and services conditional on policy responses and the range of expectations for climate change...|$|R
