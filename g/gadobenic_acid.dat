50|$|BOPTA is a {{derivative}} of DTPA {{in which one}} terminal carboxyl group, -C(O)OH is replaced by -C-O-CH2C6H5. Thus <b>gadobenic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is closely related to}} gadopentetic acid. BOPTA itself was first synthesized in 1995.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gadobenic</b> <b>acid</b> (MultiHance®) is {{sometimes}} categorized as a BPA; however, as it only binds weakly to albumin and because hepatobiliary uptake of this compound occurs, this contrast agent {{should not be}} classified as a BPA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gadobenic</b> <b>acid</b> (INN, {{trade name}} MultiHance) {{is a complex}} of {{gadolinium}} with the ligand BOPTA. In {{the form of the}} methylglucamine salt meglumine gadobenate (INNm) or gadobenate dimeglumine (USAN), it is used as a gadolinium-based MRI contrast medium.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{purposes}} of this study were to evaluate the risk for analytical interferencewith gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) for the colorimetric measurement of serum iron (Fe 3 +) and to investigate the mechanisms involved. Materials and Methods: Rat serum was spiked with several concentrations of all molecular categories of GBCAs, ligands, or ‘‘free’ ’ soluble gadolinium (Gd 3 +). Serum iron concentration was determined by 2 different colorimetric methods at pH 4. 0 (with a Vitros DT 60 analyzer or a Cobas Integra 400 an-alyzer). Secondly, the cause of interference was investigated by (a) adding free soluble Gd 3 + orMn 2 + to serum in the presence of <b>gadobenic</b> <b>acid</b> or gadodiamide and (b) electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Results: Spurious decrease in serum Fe 3 + concentration was observed with all linear GBCAs (only with the Vitros DT 60 technique occurring at pH 4. 0) but not with macrocyclic GBCAs or with free soluble Gd 3 +. Spurious hyposideremia was also observed with the free ligands present in the pharmaceutical solutions of the linear GBCAs gadopentetic acid and gadodiamide (ie, diethylene triamin...|$|E
