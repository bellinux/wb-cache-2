25|$|In 1967, a {{transition}} to an elected government was scheduled, and after a power struggle within the military, Thiệu ran for the presidency with Kỳ as his running mate--both men had wanted the top job. To allow the two to work together, their fellow officers had agreed to have a military body controlled by Kỳ shape policy behind the scenes. The election was rigged to ensure that Thiệu and Kỳ's military ticket would win, and strong executive powers meant that junta, in effect, still ruled. Leadership tensions persisted, and Thiệu prevailed, sidelining Kỳ supporters from key military and cabinet posts. Thiệu then passed legislation to restrict candidacy eligibility for the 1971 election, banning almost all would-be opponents; Kỳ and the rest withdrew as {{it was obvious that}} the poll would be a sham; Thiệu went on to win more than 90 percent of the vote and the election uncontested, while Kỳ retired. With the fall of Saigon, Kỳ fled to the United States. He continued to <b>heavily</b> <b>criticize</b> both the communists and Thiệu, and the former prevented him from returning. However, in 2004, he became the first South Vietnamese leader to return, calling for reconciliation between communists and anti-communists.|$|E
2500|$|As the Yugoslav Wars erupted, Balašević {{was forced}} to stop collaborating with Stanić and Grabušić (the two forming the jazz rock band Elvis Stanić Group). Balašević withdrew to isolation, partly due to his anti-war attitudes. His next album Jedan od onih života... (One of Those Lives...), {{released}} in 1993, featured Aleksandar Dujin on piano, Dušan Bezuha on guitar, Đorđe Petrović on keyboards, Aleksandar Kravić on bass guitar, Josip Kovač on saxophone, and Dragoljub Đuričić (formerly of YU grupa, Leb i Sol and Kerber) on drums. The songs such as [...] "Krivi smo mi" [...] ("It's Our Fault") and [...] "Čovek sa mesecom u očima" [...] ("The Man with the Moon in His Eyes") heavily criticized and denounced the ongoing war. At the same time, the compilation album Najveći hitovi (Greatest hits), featuring songs recorded during the 1986-1991 period, was released. The songs which appeared on the compilation were chosen by Balašević himself. At the time, he started to <b>heavily</b> <b>criticize</b> the regime of Slobodan Milošević on his concerts.|$|E

2500|$|Official inquiry {{brought to}} light {{the fact that the}} fatal flight had been made under protest by Commander Lansdowne (a native of Greenville, Ohio), who had warned the Navy Department of the violent weather {{conditions}} that were common to that area of Ohio in late summer. His pleas for a cancellation of the flight only caused a temporary postponement: his superiors were keen to publicize airship technology and justify the huge cost of the airship to the taxpayers. So, as Lansdowne's widow consistently maintained at the inquiry, publicity rather than prudence won the day. This event was the trigger for Army Colonel Billy Mitchell to <b>heavily</b> <b>criticize</b> the leadership of both the Army and the Navy, leading directly to his court-martial for insubordination and the end of his military career. Heinen, according to the Daily Telegraph, placed the mechanical fault for the disaster on the removal of eight of the craft's 18 safety valves, saying that without them he would not have flown on her [...] "for a million dollars". [...] These valves had been removed in order to better preserve the vessel's helium, which at that time was considered a limited global resource of great rarity and strategic military importance; without these valves, the helium contained in the rising gas bags had expanded too quickly for the bags' valves' design capacity, causing the bags to tear apart the hull as they ruptured (of course, the helium which had been contained in these bags became lost into the upper atmosphere).|$|E

He proposed lowering number of votes required to break a filibuster to 55 from the current 60. In response to Ellsworth's charges, Coats published his lobbying record in an 815-page document.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the defeat}} in New York in 1867, Samuel Newitt Wood, {{leader of a}} rebel faction of the state Republican Party, arrived in Kansas by request of Stone, and invited the Equal Rights Association to help launch their women's {{suffrage}} campaign. Wood had emigrated to Kansas to prevent the extension of slavery. A true abolitionist and successful politician, Wood won election to the Kansas senate in 1867. Though he genuinely cared about women's suffrage, Wood also hoped to make his campaign in Kansas a success {{so that he could}} get enough recognition to run for national office. He directed a strong rights campaign, forcing the Republican Kansas legislature to submit two separate bills for black and women's suffrage. The Equal Rights Association tried to sway the abolitionists to campaign alongside them, but received no response. Wood, supported both women's and black suffrage, but was accused of being only interested in women's suffrage. Many abolitionists began to question Wood's motives when they thought he opposed black suffrage {{as a member of the}} house in 1864. They began to <b>heavily</b> <b>criticize</b> his campaign, accusing him of promoting women's suffrage only to defeat black suffrage. Wood actually supported Impartial Suffrage, supporting both the rights of blacks and women. Nonetheless, the equal rights campaign managed to stay afloat through the spring of 1867, due to a large female populace in Kansas that produced [...] "the largest and most enthusiastic meetings and any one of our audiences would give a majority for women." ...|$|E

5000|$|Development of Cortex Strikes Back {{began in}} October 1996. For the game, Andy Gavin {{created a new}} engine and {{scripting}} language named [...] "Game Oriented Object LISP 2" [...] (GOOL 2) that was three {{times faster than the}} previous game's engine, could handle ten times the animation frames and twice the polygon count. The jungle levels were originally to have featured ground fog, but this was abandoned when magazines and the public began to <b>heavily</b> <b>criticize</b> other developers for using fog to hide polygon count. Sunlight and depth accentuation was experimented with for these levels. Wanting to have some [...] "dirty" [...] locations in the game, Naughty Dog worked in the sewer levels and added color contrast to the levels to show depth and break up the repetitive monotony of the endless sewer pipes. A flat plane z-buffer was created for the game; because the water surfaces and mud in the jungle had to be a flat plane and be exactly flat on the Y-axis, there could be no waves and the subdividing plane could not be at an odd angle. The effect only worked on objects in the foreground and was only used on Crash, some enemies and a few boxes at the same time. The soundtrack of Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back was provided by Mutato Muzika (consisting of Mark Mothersbaugh and Josh Mancell), while the sound effects were created by Universal Sound Studios (consisting of Mike Gollom, Ron Horwitz and Kevin Spears). The characters were designed by Charles Zembillas of American Exitus, Incorporated. Clancy Brown provided the voice of Doctor Neo Cortex, while Brendan O'Brien voiced the dual role of Doctor N. Gin and Doctor Nitrus Brio and Vicki Winters voiced Coco Bandicoot. The game was unveiled at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, Georgia in June 1997 to a positive response from the game industry. The game went into the alpha stage in August 1997. Around that time, Dan Arey, the lead designer of Gex: Enter the Gecko, joined Naughty Dog and streamlined the level design.|$|E

40|$|I {{read with}} {{interest}} the paper entitled, “Acute effects of indacaterol on lung hyperinflation in moderate COPD: a comparison with tiotropium”, that has been recently published on line in Respiratory Medicine(1). As I {{have had in the}} past a recurrent exchange of opinions with some of the Authors on the spirometric criteria for defining airflow limitation, [2], [3], [4], [5] and [6] and particularly on the relative value of the fixed ratio (FR) FEV 1 /FVC < 0. 7 proposed by the GOLD initiative 7 versus the Lower Limit of Normal (LLN) of FEV 1 /VC, 8 I carefully read the entry criteria of the study and I was surprised to verify that, similarly to previous studies, 9 the same Authors, who <b>heavily</b> <b>criticize</b> the GOLD criteria to the point of requesting the endorsement not only of the Italian “scientific” respiratory societies but also of the Italian Ministry of Health 10 continue to use the GOLD criteria in their clinical trials and practice. [1] and [9] I did notice that in this specific study 1 they used both the post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0. 7 and the LLN of FEV 1 /VC related to predicted values, 8 but unfortunately they omitted to mention whether the values were pre- or post-bronchodilators, and whether the predicted values used to express the results were pre- or post-bronchodilator. As the methods were not described in details in the paper, I went to the study protocol 11 and I found that the LLN of FEV 1 /VC was not mentioned in the protocol nor in the amendments, and that the only entry criteria for the study were the GOLD criteria. 7 As I stated in previous correspondence, [2], [4] and [6] I {{do not believe that the}} use of one criterion or the other creates a major problem, but I have to admit that my opinion is not based on evidence. I think it would be interesting to give to the Authors the opportunity to provide this evidence, by publishing the individual data of FR and LLN not reported in the paper, and comment on discrepancies, if any...|$|E
