50|$|Retail Back-office {{software}} {{is used to}} manage business operations that {{are not related to}} direct sales efforts and interfaces that are not seen by consumers. Typically, the business processes managed with back-office software include some combination of inventory control, price book management, manufacturing, and supply chain management (SCM). Back-office {{software is}} distinct from <b>front-office</b> <b>software,</b> which typically refers to customer relationship management (CRM) software used for managing sales, marketing, and other customer-centric activities.|$|E
40|$|No <b>front-office</b> <b>software</b> {{can survive}} without {{providing}} derivatives of option prices {{with respect to}} underlying market or model parameters, the so called Greeks. If a closed form solution for an option exists, Greeks can be computed analytically and they are numerically stable. However, for American style options, there is no closed-form solution. The price is computed by binomial trees, finite difference methods or an analytic approximation. Taking derivatives of these prices leads to instable numerics or misleading results, specially for Greeks of higher order. We compare the computation of the Greeks in various pricing methods and conclude with the recommendation to use Leisen-Reime...|$|E
50|$|Some institutions, notably {{those that}} {{invested}} in a rapid development (RAD) team, choose to blend profiles inside the trading room, where traders, financial engineers and <b>front-office</b> dedicated <b>software</b> developers sit side by side. The latter therefore report to a head of trading rather than to a head of IT.|$|R
50|$|The last hurdle {{for artists}} to {{overcome}} was the large size a high-resolution image would produce. Even {{though there are}} no more problems cutting out individual images- to actually assemble several large images to create a design is still a challenge.That is why CAM software not only works as design software, but is also a data management tool. In the <b>front-office</b> of the <b>software</b> the user will be working with low resolution files (GIF or PNG to keep transparency). Once a design is finished it is rendered or converted back into a PSD file using the images maximum resolution and converting their color-coding from RGB to CMYK.|$|R
