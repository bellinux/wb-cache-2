500|$|Street {{is a large}} {{village and}} civil parish in the county of Somerset, England. The 2011 census {{recorded}} the parish as having a population of 11,805. It is situated on a <b>dry</b> <b>spot</b> in the Somerset Levels, {{at the end of}} the Polden Hills, [...] south-west of Glastonbury. There is evidence of Roman occupation. Much of the history of the village is dominated by Glastonbury Abbey until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and indeed its name comes from a 12th-century causeway from Glastonbury which was built to transport local Blue Lias stone from what is now Street to rebuild the Abbey, although it had previously been known as Lantokay and Lega.|$|E

Sea water swamped the town overnight on August 10, and it was not until around noon when the storm let up and waters receded with a shift in winds. Property damage was widespread and many trees were blown down. The hurricane beached several watercraft, destroyed wharves, and inflicted losses that [...] "can hardly by estimated", but were initially judged at up to $10,000. No lives were lost in Balize. Further down the storm's track, Biloxi, Mississippi, experienced a gale beginning on the morning of August 11 and lasting until early the next morning. Tides ran [...] above average at Biloxi, and in Mobile, Alabama, residents also found wind-driven rain seeping [...] "through cracks and crevices not known before to exist" [...] in dwellings [...] "always waterproof to ordinary showers". Waters rose enough to cause minor inundations, but not nearly at the same severity as those that occurred in other areas. Heavy storm conditions extended as far east as Pensacola, Florida, where [...] of rain fell, accompanied by frequent thunder and lightning. The overall death toll from the hurricane was at least 47.|$|E

In one of his experiments, he allowed amino acids to dry out as if puddled in a warm, <b>dry</b> <b>spot</b> in prebiotic conditions.

To preserve conventional bubble geometry, such experiments need to be carried out in low gravity. We report here two kinds of saturated boiling experiments. First we discuss the spatial experiments with SF 6 at 46 ∘C. Next we address two ground-based experiments under magnetic gravity compensation with H 2 at 33 K. We compare both kinds of experiments and show their complementarity. The <b>dry</b> <b>spots</b> under vapor bubbles are visualized by using transparent heaters made with metal oxide films. We evidence two regimes of the <b>dry</b> <b>spots</b> growth: the regime of circular <b>dry</b> <b>spots</b> and the regime of chain coalescence of <b>dry</b> <b>spots</b> that immediately precedes the heater dryout. A recent H 2 experiment is shown to bridge the gap between the near-critical and low pressure boiling experiments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Dried</b> blood <b>spots</b> offer many {{advantages}} as a sample format including ease {{and safety of}} transport and handling. To date, the majority of mass spectrometry analyses of <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots</b> have focused on small molecules or hemoglobin. However, <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots</b> are a potentially rich source of protein biomarkers, {{an area that has}} been overlooked. To address this issue, we have applied an untargeted bottom-up proteomics approach to the analysis of <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots.</b> We present an automated and integrated method for extraction of endogenous proteins from the surface of <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots</b> and sample preparation via trypsin digestion by use of the Advion Biosciences Triversa Nanomate robotic platform. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry of the resulting digests enabled identification of 120 proteins from a single <b>dried</b> blood <b>spot.</b> The proteins identified cross a concentration range of four orders of magnitude. The method is evaluated and the results discussed in terms of the proteins identified and their potential use as biomarkers in screening programs...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} {{and develop}} an immunonephelometric assay for {{the determination of}} alpha- 1 antitrypsin (AAT) levels in <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots</b> from COPD patients in Brazil. METHODS: We determined AAT levels in serum samples and <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots</b> from 192 COPD patients. For the preparation of <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots,</b> a disk (diameter, 6 mm) was placed into a tube, eluted with 200 &# 181;L of PBS, and stored overnight at 4 &# 186;C. All of the samples were analyzed by immunonephelometry in duplicate. We used the bootstrap resampling method {{in order to determine}} a cut-off point for AAT levels in <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots.</b> RESULTS: The correlation coefficient between the AAT levels in serum samples and those in <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots</b> was r = 0. 45. For <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots,</b> the cut-off value was 2. 02 mg/dL (97 % CI: 1. 45 - 2. 64 mg/dL), with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 100 %, 95. 7 %, 27. 2 %, and 100 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This method for the determination of AAT levels in <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots</b> appears to be a reliable screening tool for patients with AAT deficiency...|$|R

40|$|The precise quantitation {{of smoking}} during {{pregnancy}} is difficult in retrospective studies. Routinely collected blood specimens from newborns, stored as <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots,</b> {{may provide a}} low-cost method to objectively measure maternal smoking close {{to the time of}} delivery. This article compares cotinine levels in <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots</b> to those in umbilical cord blood to assess cotinine in <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots</b> as a biomarker of maternal smoking close to the time of delivery. The California Genetic Disease Screening Program provided <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots</b> from 428 newborns delivered in 2001 - 2003 with known umbilical cord blood cotinine levels. Cotinine in <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots</b> was measured in 6. 35 -mm punches by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (quantitation limit, 3. 1 ng/mL). Repeated measures of cotinine in <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots</b> were highly correlated (R 2 = 0. 99, P < 0. 001) among 100 <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots</b> with cotinine quantitated in 2 separate punches. Linear regression revealed that cotinine levels in <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots</b> were slightly lower than those in umbilical cord blood and predicted umbilical cord blood cotinine levels well (β = 0. 95, R 2 = 0. 80, and P < 0. 001 for both cotinine levels in log 10 scale). When defining active smoking as a cotinine level of 10 ng/mL or more and using umbilical cord blood cotinine as the criterion standard, we found that measurements of cotinine in <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots</b> had high sensitivity (92. 3 %) and specificity (99. 7 %) in the prediction of maternal active smoking. Cotinine levels in <b>dried</b> blood <b>spots</b> are an accurate biomarker of maternal smoking close to the time of delivery. © 2013 The Author.
