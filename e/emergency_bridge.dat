Dubrovnik was sailed to Taranto in southern Italy on 21 May, where she underwent repairs and a refit. She was renamed Premuda, after the Dalmatian island near which an Italian motor torpedo boat had sunk the Austro-Hungarian dreadnought [...] in June 1918. Her aft deckhouse and <b>emergency</b> <b>bridge</b> were removed and replaced with an anti-aircraft platform, and her mainmast and funnels were shortened. Her four single mount Škoda [...] L/56 guns were replaced by four single mount 135 mm /45 guns and her twin Škoda [...] /L55 anti-aircraft guns were replaced by a [...] /L15 howitzer firing star shells for illumination, while the six Škoda /L67 anti-aircraft guns were replaced by four Breda Model 35 [...] /L65 machine guns in single mounts, space for the latter being made available by removing her searchlights. A new director was also fitted to her bridge. Later in her Italian service, the [...] howitzer {{was replaced by a}} twin Breda [...] /L54 anti-aircraft gun mount. In Italian service, her crew consisted of 13 officers and 191 enlisted ranks.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} design, however, {{violated a}} patent on the Callender-Hamilton bridge. The designer of that bridge, A. M. Hamilton, successfully applied to the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors. [...] The Bailey Bridge, however, had several advantages over Hamilton's design. For example, damaged parts could not be replaced quickly on the Callender-Hamilton bridge, an essential requirement for military use. The Callender-Hamilton bridge was modified by the London County Council engineers' department {{in the design of}} three <b>emergency</b> <b>bridges</b> which were erected across the River Thames in 1940. Damaged parts of these could be quickly replaced. Experience gained in this work contributed {{to the development of the}} Bailey Bridge.|$|R

Assembling a Callender-Hamilton bridge takes much longer than the more familiar Bailey bridge as it is made up of individual lengths of galvanised steel bolted together with galvanised high-strength steel bolts, all of which require torque settings. It is stronger and simpler in design concept than the Bailey bridge.|$|E
50|$|The {{unexpected}} Hungarian victory {{forced the}} Mongol generals {{to modify their}} plans. Sejban was sent north to a ford with a smaller force to cross the river and attack {{the rear of the}} bridge-guard. At about 04:00, as daylight started to break, they began the crossing. Meanwhile, Subutai went south to build a makeshift <b>emergency</b> <b>bridge</b> while the Hungarians were engaged at the main bridge, but left Batu a plan to use giant stone throwers to clear the crossbowmen opposing them. At dawn, Batu, with the help of seven stone throwers, attacked the Hungarian guards on the bridge. When Sejban and his men arrived, the Hungarians retreated to their camp. The Mongol main forces finished crossing the river around 08:00.|$|E

50|$|On April 5, 1992, SEPTA {{began their}} 18-month-long RailWorks project, which {{included}} two multi-month shutdowns of the Reading mainline from Wayne Junction to Market East for <b>emergency</b> <b>bridge</b> repairs. As {{part of the}} project, North Broad Street and Temple University stations were completely rebuilt. Within {{two weeks of the}} closure, demolition of the old platforms was under way. The rebuilt station has two side platforms serving only the outer tracks, which were chosen to straighten the curved tracks around the former island platforms and thus allow higher speeds through the station for express trains. The pedestrian tunnel was closed and filled; access to the platforms is via ramps from North Broad Street. The station, renamed as North Broad, reopened at the end of Railworks on September 5, 1993.|$|E
5000|$|The bridge's design, which lacked {{shoulders}} {{for disabled}} or wrecked vehicles {{to pull out}} of the flow of traffic, made it a severe bottleneck for commuters going to the Orlando Area beginning in the 1980s. A series of fatal traffic collisions on it and similarly-designed bridges statewide, most notably the Interstate 75 Lake Panasoffkee Bridge, led to a move in 2000 to use state <b>emergency</b> <b>bridge</b> funds similar to the contingency funds used to rebuild the Sunshine Skyway Bridge to begin planned reconstruction. Work began in 2001, and a new dual structure consisting of two three-lane spans, each with wide shoulders on either side, was fully opened in May 2004. [...] The old bridge was dismantled over the next few months. Upon completion, the new structure was officially renamed the St. Johns River Veterans Memorial Bridge.|$|E
50|$|During the Second World War a {{temporary}} or <b>emergency</b> <b>bridge</b> was {{built over the}} Kennet and Avon canal, joining the park with the centre of town. The reason for this was because it was feared the other main bridge in the centre of town was to be bombed which would have effectively split the town in two. Although {{it was supposed to}} be {{a temporary}} bridge it became a key crossing point and lasted up until 2001 when it was replaced with a new structure. Erroneously this was called the American Bridge because although it was built by civilian contractors for the War Office its plans had been stamped by the American Army, certifying its use for their forces. A major problem with the temporary bridge was that it was only 7 ft high, much lower than the recommended height of 8 ft 6 in.|$|E
50|$|On October 16, 2009, the New Hampshire Department of Transportation and the Maine Department of Transportation {{announced}} the immediate {{closure of the}} bridge to all motor vehicle traffic for <b>emergency</b> repairs.

50|$|Even {{after the}} First World War, the Rhine Province, and thereby Boppard too, belonged to Prussia. Between 1919 and 1923, there were efforts {{throughout}} the Rhineland {{to separate from}} Prussia, but they were unsuccessful. The National Socialists’ seizure of power in 1933 brought Boppard no changes at first, as the Centre Party had won 50% of the vote at the 1933 elections. However, on Kristallnacht (9-10 November 1938), the Nazis destroyed the synagogue on Binger Gasse (lane), which had been opened in 1867. Many Jews were seized, and some were sent to concentration camps. Roughly {{two thirds of the}} 100 or so Jews living in Boppard emigrated. Those that remained were deported in 1942. In 1940, the Marienberg Convent and its associated school were closed under pressure from the régime. Although Boppard was not the main target of any air strike, bombs were nevertheless dropped on the town. Beginning on 19 March 1945, the Rhine’s left bank was controlled by United States forces, who built an <b>emergency</b> <b>bridge</b> across the Rhine at Boppard.|$|E
50|$|The US {{government}} report issued in September 2011 stated that BP is ultimately {{responsible for the}} spill, and that Halliburton and Transocean {{share some of the}} blame. The report states that the main cause was the defective cement job, and Halliburton, BP and Transocean were, in different ways, responsible for the accident. The report stated that, although the events leading to the sinking of Deepwater Horizon were set into motion by the failure to prevent a well blowout, the investigation revealed numerous systems deficiencies, and acts and omissions by Transocean and its Deepwater Horizon crew, that had an adverse impact on the ability to prevent or limit the magnitude of the disaster. The report also states that a central cause of the blowout was failure of a cement barrier allowing hydrocarbons to flow up the wellbore, through the riser and onto the rig, resulting in the blowout. The loss of life and the subsequent pollution of the Gulf of Mexico were the result of poor risk management, last‐minute changes to plans, failure to observe and respond to critical indicators, inadequate well control response, and insufficient <b>emergency</b> <b>bridge</b> response training by companies and individuals responsible for drilling at the Macondo well and for the operation of the drilling platform.|$|E

Batman, Robin, and Rima the Jungle Girl contend with a {{spreading}} forest fire, {{and have to}} search for a pair of escaped prisoners who have stolen a forestry truck filled with dynamite. Rima's main contribution is to call upon a nearby bear to push down some trees for an <b>emergency</b> <b>bridge</b> across a wide gap. Her next appearance is in [...] "River of Doom" [...] (November 4, 1977): Wonder Woman and Rima the Jungle Girl search for archaeologists who have accidentally stumbled onto a burial ground of angry natives. The archaeologists are captured and sentenced to death on the River of Doom. The superheroes find the would-be victims by using indigenous animals to scout them out at Rima's command. They later rescue the scientists. Rima's main contribution is summoning crocodiles to attack their pursuers' canoes. Finally, she is featured in [...] "Return of Atlantis", from October 25, 1980. Aquaman is captured by Queen Ocina when the lost city of Atlantis rises from the sea. Ocina plans to conquer the world with her female warriors, but Wonder Woman and Rima gather the Amazons of Paradise Island to stop her.

5000|$|Volume II of {{the report}} cited above {{contains}} {{the report of the}} Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE). [...] That volume states that a central cause of the blowout was failure of acement barrier in the production casing string, a high‐strength steel pipe set in a well to ensure well integrity and to allow future production. The failure of the cement barrier allowed hydrocarbons to flow up the wellbore, through the riser and onto the rig, resulting in the blowout. The loss of life and the subsequent pollution of the Gulf of Mexico were the result of poor risk management, last‐minute changes to plans, failure to observe and respond to critical indicators, inadequate well control response, and insufficient <b>emergency</b> <b>bridge</b> response training by companies and individuals responsible for drilling at the Macondo well and for the operation of the drilling platform. BP, as the designated operator under BOEMRE regulations, was ultimately responsible for conducting operations at Macondo in a way thatensured the safety and protection of personnel, equipment, natural resources, and the environment. Transocean, the owner of the Deepwater Horizon, was responsible for conducting safe operations and for protecting personnel on board. Halliburton, as a contractor to BP, was responsible for conducting the cement job, and, through its subsidiary (Sperry Sun), had certain responsibilities for monitoring the well.|$|E
50|$|In 1515, Hachenbach {{passed along}} with the other villages in the Eßweiler Tal (dale) into the lordship of the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves of Grumbach. In 1595, the Eßweiler Tal, and thereby Hachenbach too, then passed to the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken. Like many other villages in the region, Hachenbach, too, was utterly {{destroyed}} in 1677 in the Franco-Dutch War (1672-1678) by French King Louis XIV’s troops. Even though a 1755 agreement between Palatinate-Zweibrücken and the Rhinegraves of Grumbach resulted in the cession of ﬁve villages by the former back to the latter, Hachenbach remained with Zweibrücken and received a customs station at the bridge across the Glan, for Hachenbach had become a border village. This bridge, ﬁrst built as a stone bridge in 1751/1752, was of special importance to the village. All postal and road trafﬁc between Meisenheim and Zweibrücken went across this bridge {{in the area of the}} so-called Hohe Straße (“High Road”). The bridge had its ﬁrst documentary mention in 1693, when it was newly built, although it was still only a wooden bridge then. The cost of this bridge, which was completed in May 1752 and which was thereby the earliest known crossing of the Glan, was 1,746 Gulden, two thirds of which (1,164 Gulden) was borne by the treasury of the Zweibrücken Oberamt of Lichtenberg, and the other third of which (582 Gulden) was borne by the administration of the Lordship of Kellenbach. In 1784, the bridge was heavily damaged in an ice run on the Glan, and thus Duke Carl II August of Zweibrücken saw to it in 1789 that a great two-storey-high and 70-foot-long (actually the old German measure called a Schuh, which literally means “shoe”; this was >20 m) wing wall was built onto the bridge on the Hachenbach (right) side, obliged as he felt to shield the bridge against any further such misfortunes. In 1794, the French military broke the arch nearest the Hachenbach side. Until 1825, a wooden <b>emergency</b> <b>bridge</b> was used, until the stone bridge could be set right again. As before, the cost was split at a ratio of 2:1, between the rightful heirs to the lordships on each side of the Glan, but the total this time was only 850 Gulden.|$|E
