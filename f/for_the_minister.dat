5|$|First, the High Court held, upon an {{examination}} of section 3 of the UPA and section 24(1) of the SA, {{that there was no}} express requirement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Minister</b> to have given the affected parties a right to be heard before the orders were made. Further, {{there was no room for}} the appellants' contention that the principles of natural justice had to be complied with fully. The orders had been made with respect to both the public interest and the public order, and their objective was clearly the preservation of national security. The Court affirmed the conclusion of Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, in R. v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs, ex parte Hosenball (1977) that in such situations the ordinary principles of natural justice have to be modified to accommodate the public interest.|$|E
5|$|The first preview {{screening}} of the 113-minute version of The Rules of the Game took place on June 28, 1939. It received a poor reaction from the audience.

When the awards were announced ten days later Marcel Carne's Le Quai des brumes won the first prize and The Rules of the Game was not a runner-up. Because of the success and popularity of Renoir's previous films, The Rules of the Game was highly anticipated and Zay had expected to award it the prize.

Starting in 1955, he worked for a company called Gradmann und Holler, an {{insurance}} broker company for large businesses. Kiep owned 15 percent of the company in 1982. His involvement with Gradmann und Holler sparked controversy. When Kiep became minister in Lower Saxony in 1976, Volkswagen and other local companies went into business with Gradmann und Holler, creating a possible conflict of interest <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>minister.</b> Kiep also served on Volkswagen's board of directors. Kiep denied abusing his power as minister, saying that the deal with Volkswagen had been financially damaging rather than profitable for his company. Due to his successful business ventures, Kiep was considered {{to be one of the}} richest politicians in Germany. In an interview, Kiep told Playboy that he could live well just from the interest from his savings.|$|E

Allegations spread after the war that he had done nothing to warn the wider community, but had focused instead on trying to save a smaller number. The inclusion on the train of his family, as well as 388 people from the ghetto in his home town of Kolozsvár, reinforced the view of his critics that his actions had been self-serving.|$|E

In the beginning of 1919, Bortkevičienė and other prominent personalities, including Mečislovas Reinys, Juozas Vailokaitis, and Liudas Gira, were jailed as hostages by the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic headed by Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas. Lithuanian SSR demanded release of communists held by the Lithuanian government. She spent six months in prisons in Vilnius, Daugavpils, and Smolensk.|$|E

Furthermore, he forced the Minister to hire two individuals into mid-level government jobs and finally asked for another favor in a deal involving a hydro-electrical power plant. Meta mentioned that the profit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Minister</b> of the Economy would be around 700,000 euros in one of the deals and 7% {{of the value of the}} investment in the other – his personal profit was not mentioned.

25|$|After a {{delay of}} more than {{eighteen}} months, the Labour Minister of Transport, Barbara Castle, announced in September 1966 that the line from Three Bridges to Groombridge would close.

500|$|Though doctrinally Churches of Christ hold to {{the closed}} communion viewpoint, in {{practice}} congregations rarely prohibit visitors from taking communion, {{on the view}} that per 1 Corinthians 11:28 the visitor must [...] "examine himself" [...] and decide to partake or decline (i.e. it is not <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>minister,</b> elders/deacons, or members to decide who may partake); thus, it is more akin to open communion.|$|E
500|$|As {{membership}} {{continued to}} grow, the congregation {{needed to find}} a permanent meeting place. [...] The church purchased a 1.07 acre (0.43 ha) lot {{at the intersection of}} present-day Arlington Boulevard and South George Mason Drive. [...] In November 1948, ground was broken on the church's first building, located at 4451 1st Place South, with assistance from the American Unitarian Association which gave the congregation a $15,000 loan. [...] The original building was designed by architect and church member Earl B. Bailey. [...] It was a brick Colonial Revival building containing an auditorium, a kitchen, an office <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>minister,</b> and a few meeting rooms. [...] The first service in the new building was held in June 1949 and it was dedicated on October 2. [...] By 1950, church membership had reached almost 250. [...] The success of the Arlington church convinced All Souls minister Arthur Powell Davies to establish the Greater Washington Association for Unitarian Advance (later renamed the Greater Washington Association for Unitarian Universalist Churches) in 1950. [...] The organization was founded to assist with establishing additional Unitarian congregations in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, and All Souls and the Arlington church were its first members.|$|E
500|$|Although some {{plantation}} {{owners were}} enlightened or paternalistic, the slave population {{was on the}} whole poorly treated. Churches for whites existed from the inauguration of the colonies, but slaves were barred from worshipping before 1807 as colonists feared education and Christianisation would lead slaves to question their status and lead to dissatisfaction. Indeed, a Wesleyan missionary who arrived in 1805 wanting {{to set up a}} church for slaves was immediately repatriated by order of the governor. The London Missionary Society (LMS) entered Guyana shortly {{after the end of the}} slave trade at the behest of a plantation owner who believed that slaves ought to have access to religious teachings. Hermanus Post, a naturalised Englishman of Dutch descent, advocated teaching of religion and literacy. The idea, considered radical at the time, was supported by some who may have thought religion was to be offered as a consolation in place of emancipation. The colonial administration was hostile to the idea. It was written in the official journal, Royal Gazette, in 1808: [...] "It is dangerous to make slaves Christians, without giving them their liberty." [...] Others strongly opposed. Other plantation owners, who felt that teaching slaves anything other than their duties to their masters would lead to [...] "anarchy, chaos and discontent" [...] and precipitate the destruction of the colony. Post ignored these protestations and made facilities available for worship. The facilities were easily outgrown by popularity of worship within just eight months. The LMS contributed £100; Post gave the land and paid the balance, and a chapel with 600-person capacity was inaugurated on 11 September 1808. He also had a house constructed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>minister</b> at a cost of £1200, of which £200 was subscribed by other [...] "respectable inhabitants of the colony".|$|E
