50|$|On November 27, 2012 a strombolian type {{eruption}} {{started from}} two <b>fissures.</b> Basaltic <b>lava</b> flows move relatively fast, and quickly flooded buildings 4 km away. The eruption continued {{for more than}} a month, as lava continued to flow from the <b>fissures.</b> <b>Lava</b> flowed up to 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the line of fissures on the volcano’s southern flank. This satellite image was collected on December 22, 2012. According to the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team (KVERT), the eruption is ongoing.|$|R
5000|$|Mud volcanoes {{are often}} {{associated}} with <b>lava</b> <b>volcanoes,</b> and the typical relationship is that where they are close, the mud volcanoes emit incombustible gases, while the ones further away emit methane.|$|R
25|$|Several {{stages of}} {{volcanic}} activity followed. The first stage with Paddys River Volcanics, Walker Volcanics in west Canberra, Hawkins Volcanics {{in the north}} and Ainslie Volcanics in the north east had acidic <b>lava</b> <b>volcanoes</b> erupting.|$|R
25|$|<b>Lava</b> {{from the}} <b>fissure</b> vent tended to flow {{downhill}} toward the southeast, covering {{part of the}} <b>fissure.</b> <b>Lava</b> tubes extend in a generally southeastern direction under the lava field, and surfaced in the far southeastern corner of the site. There is also evidence that later pāhoehoe lava lobes ran underneath or inside existing lobes, and then broke out.|$|R
50|$|A {{spatter cone}} is a low, steep-sided hill or mound that {{consists}} of welded lava fragments, called spatter, which has formed around a lava fountain issuing from a central vent. Typically, spatter cones are about 3-5 m high. In case of a linear <b>fissure,</b> <b>lava</b> fountaining will create broad embankments of spatter, called spatter ramparts, along {{both sides of the}} fissure. Spatter cones are more circular and cone shaped, while spatter ramparts are linear wall-like features.|$|R

50|$|Lava dams {{are formed}} by lava flowing or {{spilling}} into a river valley {{in sufficient quantity}} and height to temporarily overcome the explosive nature (steam) of its contact with water, and the erosive force of flowing water to remove it. The latter depends on the quantity of water flow and stream gradient. The lava may flow during numerous successive or repetitive eruptions and may emanate from single or numerous vents or <b>fissures.</b> <b>Lava</b> of this nature, like basalt, is usually associated with less explosive eruptions; more viscous lavas with lower mafic content, like dacites and rhyolites, can also flow, but {{tend to be more}} closely associated with eruptions of greater explosiveness and the formation of pyroclastics.|$|R

25|$|Followers of Hutton {{were known}} as Plutonists because they {{believed}} that some rocks were formed by vulcanism, which is the deposition of <b>lava</b> from <b>volcanoes,</b> {{as opposed to the}} Neptunists, led by Abraham Werner, who believed that all rocks had settled out of a large ocean whose level gradually dropped over time.|$|R
40|$|The Syunik rhombus-like {{structure}} in the Khanarassar active dextral fault zone of Armenia is a typical pull-apart basin, formed between terminal parts of two adjacent en echelon fault segments. Some component of subsidence associated with the faults of the structure is found between the en echelon segments; nevertheless, the dextral component continues to be predominant even on {{the boundaries of the}} pull-apart basin. The late Pleistocene and Holocene <b>lava</b> <b>volcanoes</b> of the basin are also associated with those faults that have a component of extension. The relative ages of fault displacements and volcanic eruptions have been identified by the mutual correlation of lavas, moraines and topographic features and by archaeological and radiocarbon dating. According to the interpretation of rupturing and volcanism, major earthquakes and volcanic eruptions appear inter-related and three pulses of such activity during the earlier and middle Holocene have been identified...|$|R
50|$|Several {{stages of}} {{volcanic}} activity followed. The first stage with Paddys River Volcanics, Walker Volcanics in west Canberra, Hawkins Volcanics {{in the north}} and Ainslie Volcanics in the north east had acidic <b>lava</b> <b>volcanoes</b> erupting.The next stage was Mount Painter Volcanics in middle Canberra, and Colinton Volcanics south of Queanbeyan and near Williamsdale. Then came a pause in volcanism {{at the start of the}} Upper Silurian with the Yarralumla Formation and Yass Formation sedimentary deposits. Volcanic activity resumed with Deakin Volcanics in the north west and south of Canberra. First rhyodacite was erupted followed by tuff, more rhyodacite, tuff with some underwater sediments, and finishing with rhyolite. At least four large eruptions made up this volcanic deposit. Over the top of this in the west near the Murrumbidgee River there was a further massive volcanic eruption, called Laidlaw Volcanics.|$|R
