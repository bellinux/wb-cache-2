40|$|A {{particularly}} difficult case in electromagnetic induction tomography (EMT) is to image internal structure at {{the centre of}} the object space when the material at the outer regions is conductive. This is because the outer material acts as an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>screen,</b> which partially excludes the magnetic field from the interior space and hence reduces the sensitivity at the centre. In this paper, we propose a methodology to image the conductivity distribution of an annular object when internal conductive objects are present. Finite element simulations were carried out to investigate how sensor coil outputs change with factors such as the size of internal object with regards to the external one. Linear and non-linear image reconstruction methods are applied to the tomographic data that are collected from a newly developed EMT system and image results are given in the pape...|$|E

40|$|Electromagnetic {{acoustic}} transducers (EMATs) {{often have}} an electrically conducting surface behind the coil which {{we refer to}} as a back-plate, which could be there {{to act as an}} <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>screen</b> or could be a permanent magnet which is part of standard EMAT design. Eddy current probes can share many design features with EMATs, and both are designed to generate an eddy current in the electromagnetic skin-depth of a sample. In this paper we present an analytical solution for a quick and accurate calculation of the eddy current generated by a spiral coil and for the case of EMATs we also calculate the resultant Lorentz force which leads to ultrasonic generation. The Lorentz force can arise from an interaction of the eddy current with either a dynamic magnetic field from the coil or with a static magnetic field from a permanent of electromagnet. Theoretical predictions have shown that {{in the presence of a}} ferrite back-plate, the eddy current and the Lorentz force are enhanced greatly, and this has been verified experimentally. These developments will lead to improved EMAT and eddy current probe design. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} several {{methods to}} increase the detection threshold and to improve the localization accuracy of PD by means of non-conventional UHF PD measurement. A simple and commonly used way to locate PD in GIS is the measurement in time domain (time-offlight). The time difference between the arrivals of the PD impulse on two UHF sensors is used for localization. The new developed method presented here uses the frequency domain. The basic idea is the displacement law of Fourier transformation. The interference phenomena of superposed signals from two sensors give information about the time delay of the sensor signals. This new method allows a more cost-effective localisation of PD in GIS. On-site PD measurements are made at cable connectors, while the cable is in service. A barrel sleeve, acting as an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>screen,</b> is clamped around the plug-in connector. Inside the sleeve there are monopole antennas to detect electromagnetic waves emitted from PD within the connector. Thus a sensitive PD measurement even in noisy environment is possible. PD-measurements in an unshielded laboratory were performed on several 45 kV cable connectors. Connectors with stimulated PD emitted fast electromagnetic pulses whereas measurements on connectors without PD showed only slight background noise. So the detection of UHF PD signals constitutes a strong sign for internal P...|$|E

40|$|We have {{evaluated}} the electromagnetic spectral function and its spectral properties by computing the one-loop photon polarization tensor in presence of magnetic field, {{particularly in a}} strong field approximation compared to the thermal scale. When the magnetic scale {{is higher than the}} thermal scale the lowest Landau level (LLL) becomes effectively (1 + 1) dimensional strongly correlated system that provides a kinematical threshold based on the mass scale. Beyond this threshold the photon strikes the LLL and the spectral strength starts with a high value due to the dimensional reduction and then falls off with increase of the photon energy due to LLL dynamics in a strong field approximation. This strongly enhances the dilepton rate over the thermal perturbative leading order (Born) rate at very low invariant mass.

The impedance, Z, for both the samples was found to be very sensitive functions of applied tensile stress (up to 100 MPa) exhibiting a maximum SI ratio as much as 80 % at low frequency ~ 0. 1 MHz. The nature of variation of impedance, Z, changes with the excitation frequency especially at higher frequencies in MHz region where it exhibits a peak.

An important aim of this work was to improve the compatibility, thermal stability, electrical and mechanical properties of this kind of blend, produced by different mixing techniques for instance solution and thermo-mechanical with further methodical mixing processes and greater improved mixing circumstances. Polyepichlorohydrin, polychloroprene rubber, chlorosulfonated polyethylene rubber and polyaniline dodecylbenzenesulfonate (PAni-DBSA) were selected for study as blends in this project, since the solubility parameters of polyepichlorohydrin rubber, polychloroprene, chlorosulfonated polethylene and polyaniline dodecylbenzenesulfonate were calculated to be well-matched, and also because the polyepichlorohydrin rubber (PECH), polychloroprene rubber (PCR) and chlorosulfonated polyethylene (CSPE) were thermally stable and easily obtainable. No previous literature was discovered in relation to the electrical properties of the polyepichlorohydrin, polychloroprene or chlorosulfonated polyethylene blends with polyaniline dodecylbenzenesulfonate (PAni-DBSA). Hence, the PECH, PCR and CSPE rubbers were also chosen in this work with the purpose of studying them. Non-vulcanised PECH/P Ani-DBSA, non- vulcanised PCRlPAni-DBSA and non-vulcanised CSPEIPAni-DBSA blends with appropriate electrical conductivities were produced by solution mixing for the first time in this project. Blends of the PECH, PCR and CSPE rubbers and polyaniline doped with dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, consisting of various proportions of P Ani- DBSA, were cast from solution onto polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) substrates with the aim of making electrically conductive films. Electrical conductivities of the cast films of non-vulcanised blends were calculated. Decomposition steps of electrical conductive polymer blends were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermal stabilities of the PECHlPAni-DBSA, PCRJPAni-DBSA and CSPEIP Ani-DBSA blends were affected by the proportion of polyaniline dodecylbenzenesulfonate to the rubbers.

But the practical manufacturing process is a nonlinear, time-varying uncertainty, it is difficult to establis...|$|R
