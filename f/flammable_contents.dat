50|$|One more mystery remained, {{which was}} why the LES had ignited the third stage on fire, {{something}} it {{was not supposed to}} do. The conclusion was that when the Soyuz descent module separated from the service module during the abort, it had inadvertently severed coolant lines in the service module, which then leaked out their highly <b>flammable</b> <b>contents</b> and started a fire when they were contacted by the LES exhaust.|$|E
50|$|Incendiary cluster {{bombs are}} {{intended}} to start fires, just as conventional incendiary bombs (also called firebombs). They are specifically designed for this purpose, with submunitions of white phosphorus or napalm, and they often include anti-personnel and anti-tank submunitions to hamper firefighting efforts. When used in cities they have often been preceded {{by the use of}} conventional explosive bombs to break open the roofs and walls of buildings to expose <b>flammable</b> <b>contents</b> to the incendiaries. One of the earliest examples is the so-called Molotov bread basket first used by the Soviet Union in the Winter War of 1939-40. This type of munition was extensively used by both sides in the strategic bombings of World War II. Bombs of this type were used to start firestorms or conflagrations in cases such as the bombing of Dresden in World War II and the firebombing of Tokyo. In some modern bombs, submunitions are used to deliver a highly combustible thermobaric aerosol, which is subsequently ignited, resulting in a high pressure explosion.|$|E
50|$|Avoidance {{will make}} it {{impossible}} for an explosion or deflagration to occur, for instance by means of suppressing the heat and the pressure needed for an explosion using aluminum mesh structure such as eXess, by means of consistent displacement of the O2 necessary for an explosion or deflagration to take place, by means of padding gas (f. i. CO2 or N2), or, by means of keeping the concentration of <b>flammable</b> <b>content</b> of an atmosphere consistently below or above the explosive limit, or, by means of consistent elimination of ignition sources.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} technical justification for choosing and using propane as a calibration standard for estimating total flammable {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) in an air matrix. A propane-in-nitrogen standard was selected based {{on a number of}} criteria: (1) has an analytical response similar to the VOCs of interest, (2) can be made with known accuracy and traceability, (3) is available with good purity, (4) has a matrix similar to the sample matrix, (5) is stable during storage and use, (6) is relatively non-hazardous, and (7) is a recognized standard for similar analytical applications. The Waste Retrieval Project (WRP) desires a fast, reliable, and inexpensive method for screening the <b>flammable</b> VOC <b>content</b> in the vapor-phase headspace of waste containers. Table 1 lists the flammable VOCs of interest to the WRP. The current method used to determine the VOC content of a container is to sample the container's headspace and submit the sample for gas chromatography [...] mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The driver for the VOC measurement requirement is safety: potentially flammable atmospheres in the waste containers must be allowed to diffuse prior to processing the container. The proposed flammable VOC screening method is to inject an aliquot of the headspace sample into an argon-doped pulsed-discharge helium ionization detector (Ar-PDHID) contained within a gas chromatograph. No actual chromatography is performed; the sample is transferred directly from a sample loop to the detector through a short, inert transfer line. The peak area resulting from the injected sample is proportional to the <b>flammable</b> VOC <b>content</b> of the sample. However, because the Ar-PDHID has different response factors for different flammable VOCs, a fundamental assumption must be made that the agent used to calibrate the detector is representative of the flammable VOCs of interest that may be in the headspace samples. At worst, we desire that calibration with the selected calibrating agent overestimate the value of the VOCs in a sample. By overestimating the VOC content of a sample, we want to minimize false negatives. A false negative is defined as incorrectly estimating the VOC content of the sample to be below programmatic action limits when, in fact, the sample,exceeds the action limits. The disadvantage of overestimating the <b>flammable</b> VOC <b>content</b> of a sample is that additional cost may be incurred because additional sampling and GC-MS analysis may be required to confirm results over programmatic action limits. Therefore, choosing an appropriate calibration standard for the Ar-PDHID is critical to avoid false negatives and to minimize additional analytical costs...|$|R
40|$|Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems (US) Inc. (RRFCS) has {{developed}} a system that produces synthesis gas from air and natural gas. A near-term application being considered for this technology is synthesis gas injection into reciprocating engines for reducing NO{sub x} emissions. A proof of concept study using bottled synthesis gas and a two-stroke reciprocating engine showed that injecting small amounts of high-flammable content synthesis gas significantly improved combustion stability and enabled leaner engine operation resulting in over 44 % reduction in NO{sub x} emissions. The actual NO{sub x} reduction that could be achieved {{in the field is}} expected to be engine specific, and in many cases may be even greater. RRFCS demonstrated that its synthesis gas generator could produce synthesis gas with the <b>flammable</b> <b>content</b> that was successfully used in the engine testing. An economic analysis of the synthesis gas approach estimates that its initial capital cost and yearly operating cost are less than half that of a competing NO{sub x} reduction technology, Selective Catalytic Reduction. The next step in developing the technology is an integrated test of the synthesis gas generator with an engine to obtain reliability data for system components and to confirm operating cost. RRFCS is actively pursuing opportunities to perform the integrated test. A successful integrated test would demonstrate the technology as a low-cost option to reduce NO{sub x} emissions from approximately 6, 000 existing two-stroke, natural gas-fired reciprocating engines used on natural gas pipelines in North America. NO{sub x} emissions reduction made possible at a reasonable price by this synthesis gas technology, if implemented on 25 % of these engines, would be on the order of 25, 000 tons/year...|$|R

50|$|On {{the early}} hours of August 25, 1988, a fire started at the Grandella store in Rua do Carmo (Carmo Street) and quickly spread to Rua Garrett (Garrett Street) and others, {{affecting}} a total of 18 buildings (corresponding to an 8000 m² land footprint) in the area Chiado, of which 11 were full losses with structure collapse, including the Armazéns do Chiado and Grandella department stores, that never reopened, along with several other historical shops also destroyed. The fire was fought by 1,680 firefighters from throughout the country, and was put out by 16:00 local time. Several anecdotes indicate that the poorly equipped fire crews and access difficulties (especially at Rua do Carmo) combined with the extensive <b>flammable</b> <b>contents</b> (including gas bottles for sale on the stores) meant the firefighters struggled to cope with such a large scale urban fire. Two people were killed, and 73 were injured (60 of them firemen). Between 200 and 300 people lost their homes, and close to 2000 people lost their jobs. In terms of the extent of the city affected and number of destroyed buildings, the Chiado fire is often considered the worst disaster to strike the city since the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Although it is known that the fire started with a slow combustion {{on the top floor of}} the Grandella building (which is unlikely on the event of intentional fire, that typically spreads quickly) the cause was never fully determined.|$|E
40|$|Abstract only availableFaculty Mentor: Dr. Peter Pfeifer, PhysicsNatural gas, a {{fuel source}} {{primarily}} composed of methane, is already important in many applications. Methane {{can be used}} as a fuel for cars, but difficulty arises in the practicality of storing adequate amounts in tanks of reasonable volume. A conventional approach is to compress natural gas to high pressures, a CNG tank, but such tanks must be heavy-duty and if breeched release their <b>flammable</b> <b>contents</b> dangerously rapidly. An alternative approach is to construct a tank occupied by an exceptionally porous material, such as activated carbon, which may be used to store gases by adsorption. Adsorption of gas molecules on the surface of solids may occur spontaneously, reducing the surface free energy at the solid-gas interface and resulting in higher gas densities at the surface. Such an adsorbed natural gas tank (ANG tank) may hold as much natural gas as a CNG tank, but at lower, safer pressures and thus be of a flexible, light-weight design better-suited for automobiles. A process developed by Pfeifer, et al. has produced an activated carbon which has proven superior in methane storage compared to others in the literature. However, producing this activated carbon in the lab has proven very labor-intensive, requiring over ten hours of labor per monolith (~ 0. 1 kg) of activated carbon. Its practical use in a large-scale application such as ANG tanks for automobiles necessitates a production process which is largely automated. The design of such a process and an investigation into the capital investment, maintenance, and labor costs required for it reveals that this activated carbon can be produced in large quantities at much lower costs per monolith than in the lab, and so it is practical for high-volume applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Fire {{hazards of}} the {{inheritance}} buildings are often been neglected, causing fire to take place. Most {{of the heritage}} buildings are of large scale, <b>flammable</b> priceless <b>contents</b> and large numbers of visitors, however, the existing structures are weak in fire resistance. There are a few {{factors that contribute to}} the fire in these unique yet vulnerable structures Therefore, fire risk assessment plays an important role as many historic buildings in Penang are significant in their architectural value and historically importantt and their destructions by fire are great irreplaceable losses. Thus, this study is intended to identify the current fire emergency plan of heritage temples and mansions in Penang which includes 4 buildings such as Khoo Kongsi, Cheah Kongsi, Hock Teik Chen Shin Temple and Teochew Temple. The possible fire risks of these heritage buildings will be identified and evaluated comprehensively. The previous fire cases will be considered as well in order to discover the common factors contributing to the fire cases at heritage buildings. Time and again, people do not record their findings upon completing the fire risk assessment. Hence this particular research will prepare a complete record of the fire risk assessment. Having a fire risk assessment in the heritage building in Penang can be an interesting study to find out the current situation of heritage building fire protection awareness. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work and future follow-on work {{is to develop a}} safe, efficient, and recyclable method for oxygen and/or metals extraction from lunar regolith, in support of establishing a manned lunar outpost. The approach is to solubilize the oxides that comprise lunar regolith in media consisting of ionic liquids (ILs) and/or their mixtures at temperatures at or below 300 C. Once in solution, electrolysis can either be performed in-situ to generate oxygen at the anode and hydrogen and/or metals (silicon, iron, aluminum, titanium, etc.) at the cathode. Alternatively, the water that is generated during the solubilization process can be distilled out and condensed into a separate IL and then electrolysized to produce hydrogen and oxygen. In the case of lunar regolith, this method could theoretically produce 44 g oxygen per 100 g of regolith. The oxygen can be used for human life support and/or as an oxidizer for rocket fuels, and the metals can be used as raw materials for construction and/or device fabrication. Moreover, the hydrogen produced can be used to re-generate the acidic medium, which can then be used to process additional regolith, thereby making the materials recyclable and limiting upmass requirements. An important advantage of IL acid systems is that they are much "greener" and safer than conventional materials used for regolith processing such as sulfuric or hydrochloric acids. They have very low vapor pressures, which means that they contain virtually no toxic and/or <b>flammable</b> volatile <b>content,</b> they are relatively non-corrosive, and they can exhibit good stability in harsh environments (extreme temperatures, hard vacuum, etc.). Furthermore, regolith processing can be achieved at lower temperatures than other processes such as molten oxide electrolysis or hydrogen reduction, thereby reducing initial power requirements. Six ILs have been synthesized and tested for their capability to dissolve lunar simulant, and for electrochemical and thermal stability. The results showed that ILs can be very efficient electrolytes; in particular IL/phosphoric-acid mixtures appear extremely promising for solubilizing lunar simulant. Results from preliminary experiments for distillation of water produced from the oxygen within the metal oxides of the simulant and the hydrogen from the acid indicates that over 75 % of the oxygen from the simulant can be harvested as water at a temperature of 150 C. A method for collection of oxygen from electrolysis of the water derived from solubilizing simulant was developed by using a liquid nitrogen trap to liquefy and collect the oxygen. Although precise quantification of the liquid oxygen trapped is difficult to obtain, the amount of hydrogen and oxygen collected from electrolysis of water in this system was greater than 98 %. This set-up also included a portable mass spectrometer for the identification of gases released from electrolysis cells. Regeneration of ILs through re-protonation was also demonstrated. Four sequential re-generations of an IL following solubilization of simulant showed no significant differences in amounts of simulant dissolved. Follow-on work for this project should include more studies of IL/phosphoric acid systems. Also, much more work is necessary for defining methods for electrolysis and purification of metals from regolith solubilized in ILs, and for developing a system to use the produced hydrogen to regenerate the spent IL. Finally, design and development of flight breadboard and prototype hardware is required...|$|R
