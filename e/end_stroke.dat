50|$|His {{innovative}} style, {{along with}} the profusion of his tags made his work popular. Many other Madrilene youths created their own tags inspired by Muelle's, often <b>ending</b> <b>strokes</b> with arrowheads. The spread of hip-hop culture in Spain in the late 1980s introduced the new graffiti styles developed in the United States, but variations in Muelle's work basically kept his original design. Argüello appeared in Spanish television and newspapers.|$|R

Este proyecto implica el levantamiento total de la parte eléctrica y electro neumática de todo el sistema, la reprogramación de un PLC Omron CP 1 L. El funcionamiento automático de la línea la cual incluye sensores magnéticos, final de carrera, etapas de fuerzas como inversiones de giro de motores, cilindros neumáticos. El sistema es controlado y monitoreado por un SCADA a través de la interfaz labview (National Instrument) en el cual se visualizan las señales de entradas y salida de la línea de ensamble Sony # 2. La comunicación entre el software Labview y el PLC Omron fue posible gracias a la adquisición del módulo Ethernet CP 1 W-CIF 41 y el software CX- Server OPC, que sirven de enlace entre el SCADA y el sistema automatizado.

50|$|The first pianist {{to make a}} {{complete}} recording was Artur Schnabel, who recorded them for EMI between 1932 and 1935.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{statistical}} study of writing habits for Arabic Numerals of 187 subjects in Hong Kong. A classification system of writing habits for Arabic numerals based on assigned codes of characteristic {{features such as}} slant, writing direction, relative position of strokes, angularity of turnings, shape of initial and <b>ending</b> <b>strokes,</b> etc. was developed. A set of characteristic codes representing the profile of writing habits pertaining to Arabic numerals was assigned to each writer. Apart from the distribution of characteristic features, statistical analysis of the assigned codes demonstrated homogeneity of individual hand-writing patterns. It {{has been shown that}} irrespective of the structural simplicity of Arabic numerals, no two individuals exhibited the same set of characteristic codes. The findings support the hypothesis of individuality in handwriting. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|Typefaces can {{be divided}} into two main categories: serif and sans serif. Serifs {{comprise}} the small features at the <b>end</b> of <b>strokes</b> within letters.

He would continue competing in Wahoo McDaniel's Florida promotion as well as the Mid-Atlantic and Calgary Stampede territories before suffering a career <b>ending</b> <b>stroke</b> on January 31, 1988.

50|$|To provide long opening times, the bash valve {{normally}} incorporates {{some form}} of tappet mechanism. Rather than a valve that is held open by the piston directly, the valve becomes double-acting and is opened by the piston's impact at one <b>end</b> of the <b>stroke</b> and closed by a further impact at the other <b>end</b> of the <b>stroke.</b> The tappet and valve are commonly separate, allowing the valve to remain in a well-defined fully open position throughout the stroke, however the tappet is bounced around by the piston.|$|R
50|$|The {{tendency}} of the variable force on the upper slide is to lift the machine off its lead springs at half-stroke and ease it down at the <b>ends</b> of <b>stroke.</b> This causes a pitching and, because the maximum up force is not simultaneous for the 2 cylinders it will also tend to roll on the springs.|$|R

50|$|A ball {{terminal}} is {{a design}} feature of a typeface or glyph where the <b>end</b> of a <b>stroke</b> takes a roughly circular shape, {{as opposed to}} a serif or a square end.|$|R
50|$|In the {{conventional}} double-acting engine, residual steam {{was trapped in}} the exhausting cylinder after the valve closed and compressed. This compressed steam has a cushioning effect and acts to brake the piston at the <b>end</b> of <b>stroke.</b> In the single-acting engine there is no similar effect {{at the end of}} the power stroke. This had previously been a limitation on the operating speed of single-acting engines.|$|R
5000|$|In {{typography}} and lettering, a sans-serif, sans serif, gothic, {{or simply}} sans letterform {{is one that}} does not have extending features called [...] "serifs" [...] at the <b>end</b> of <b>strokes.</b> Sans-serif fonts tend to have less line width variation than serif fonts. In most print, they are often used for headings rather than for body text. They are often used to convey simplicity and modernity or minimalism.|$|R
