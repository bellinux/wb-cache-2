One {{of the most important}} performance measurements is clock <b>jitter.</b> <b>Jitter</b> is defined as "the short-term variation of a signal with respect to its ideal position in time. " In a clock generator chip, there are many factors which contribute to output clock <b>jitter,</b> such as the device noise, supply variation, <b>jitter</b> in the reference clock, loading condition, and interference coupled from nearby circuitry. <b>Jitter</b> can be measured in different ways, including period <b>jitter</b> J PER, cycle-to-cycle <b>jitter</b> J CC, and accumulated <b>jitter</b> J ACC. In general, <b>jitter</b> consists of the deterministic <b>jitter</b> and random <b>jitter.</b> Since the deterministic <b>jitter</b> in most digital systems is introduced frommany different bit patterns from the digital data, clock signal <b>jitter</b> can usually be considered to be just random <b>jitter.</b> In this application note, we will go over the definitions and introduce test setups for making measurements. <b>Jitter</b> definitions Period jitter: J PER <b>Jitter</b> J PER is the most popular <b>jitter</b> measure. It is the time difference between a measured cycle period and the ideal cycle period. Due to its random nature, this <b>jitter</b> can be measured as Peak-to-Peak or by Root Mean Square (RMS). Let's define the clock rising edge crossing point at the threshold V TH as T PER(n), where n is the time domain index, as shown in Figure 1.

40|$|Timing signal <b>jitter</b> {{can have}} a {{profound}} impact {{on a wide variety of}} applications from analog radio frequency (RF) or audio-to-digital communications. While information in a communications system, for example, is extracted from serial data streams by sampling the data signal at specific points, the presence of small quantities of <b>jitter</b> can alter the edge positions enough to lead to data errors and high bit-error rates. Complicating the measurement of <b>jitter</b> is the way it is specified. Generally, timing signal <b>jitter</b> is specified in different ways from one application environment to another. For example, in digital data path synchronization applications, <b>jitter</b> is specified in the time domain as period or cycle-to-cycle <b>jitter.</b> In data communications applications, <b>jitter</b> is specified in the frequency domain as phase noise or “root mean square ” (RMS) <b>jitter.</b> This paper provides a basic tutorial on timing signal <b>jitter</b> for designers building electronics systems.

As part of that process, it explains the many ways timing <b>jitter</b> is specified and the differences between terms such as period <b>jitter,</b> cycle-to-cycle <b>jitter</b> and absolute period <b>jitter.</b> It then uses some common applications, such as the use of first-in/first-out (FIFO) memory devices in data acquisition subsystems, to describe the impact of <b>jitter</b> and basic error detection and recovery strategies...|$|R
40|$|Electrical systems {{which use}} voltage {{transitions}} to represent timing information {{suffer from a}} degrading phenomenon called timing <b>jitter.</b> Sampling time <b>jitter</b> is the deviation of sampling clock from its ideal position. As transmission rates raise above couple of GHz, deviations become significant comparing to signalling interval, <b>jitter</b> becomes a fundamental performance bottleneck. Especially in band-limited communication systems that imperfect sampling times result in Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) <b>jitter</b> is a very limiting factor to decode correct transmitted data. In this case, <b>jitter</b> timing error translates into amplitude error. At first, the effect of sampling time <b>jitter</b> at the received signal is modelled as an additive noise. This additive noise signal which we call it <b>jitter</b> noise is a coloured noise that also depends on input signal. Expressions for <b>jitter</b> noise correlation factors, its cross- correlation with input signal are derived. These correlations depend on input spectral density, timing <b>jitter</b> characteristic function (Fourier transform of <b>jitter</b> probability density function) and whether timing <b>jitter</b> is white or coloured. In case of first order Gauss-Markov process for sampling time <b>jitter</b> {{it is observed that}} in high memory regime (highly correlated timing <b>jitter)</b> the spectral density of additive <b>jitter</b> noise is concentrated around higher frequencies. Exploiting this quality, a spectral shaping scheme is used to improve the performance in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) for an AWGN channel with discrete input corrupted by sampling time <b>jitter.</b> Simulation results comparing the proposed scheme performance with a minimum distance decoder are provided. As another approach the well-known Viterbi Algorithm is used for decoding same AWGN channel suffering from ISI terms due to sampling <b>jitter.</b> The Viterbi algorithm, which basically is a dynamic programming algorithm, finds the most likely input data and <b>jitter</b> times based on observed output sequence. A quantized version of <b>jitter</b> times is {{used to be able to}} work with a finite state trellis and to find likelihoods along the paths of the diagram. Then Bit Error Rate curves for different <b>jitter</b> quantization levels and different impulse response lengths of channel are presented...|$|R
