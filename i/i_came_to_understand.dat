25|$|When my father, who {{had been}} {{appointed}} by his country as public notary in the customs at Bugia acting for the Pisan merchants going there, was in charge, he summoned me to him while I was still a child, and having an eye to usefulness and future convenience, desired me to stay there and receive instruction {{in the school of}} accounting. There, when I had been introduced to the art of the Indians' nine symbols through remarkable teaching, knowledge of the art very soon pleased me above all else and <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you know, Dolly, though Fly {{is such a}} darling, {{and they}} all wanted to be kind {{as well as they}} knew how, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how horrid you must have felt when you came among the whole lot of us.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} then believe the old negro was talking other than veriest nonsense; but before another week had passed <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{all too well}} that we of Virginia who were called rebels, had no rights which these red-coated gentry were bound to respect.|$|E
60|$|Not {{until he}} had been at work several moments did <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what he would do, and then it flashed upon me that it was his purpose to make an {{aperture}} through which we might the better hear {{what was going on in}} the room above.|$|R
60|$|THE HE-ANCIENT. <b>I</b> also <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> such miracles. For {{fifty years}} I sat contemplating this power in myself and concentrating my will.|$|R
60|$|Even before Pierre {{had ceased}} {{speaking}} did <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how useless {{it would be}} for me to make any attempt at taking poor little Silver Heels from those who had stolen her, and I crouched yet further among the foliage as the horsemen approached, for there had come into my mind on the instant a certain thought, call it plan if you will, the carrying out of which depended upon holding myself free.|$|R
60|$|All this I {{told the}} {{stranger}} {{as if he}} had been, an old friend, for there was something, in his voice and manner which won my heart at once, and when the sad tale was ended <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> he had not questioned me idly.|$|E
60|$|It sounded {{much like}} boasting, his {{claiming}} {{to be able to}} beat an Indian at woodcraft, for at that time I believed the savages could outwit any settler who ever lived; but before many weeks had passed <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that I had been sadly mistaken.|$|E
6000|$|... "The trouble is, you and Mrs. Lynde don't {{understand}} one another," [...] she explained. [...] "That is always {{what is wrong}} when people don't like each other. I didn't like Mrs. Lynde at first either; {{but as soon as}} <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> her I learned to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I beg {{to observe}} that I am not the 'chap who will profit' if this miserable {{allegation}} holds water. <b>I</b> am <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the truth." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} <b>I</b> had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that Hiram was {{speaking}} {{no more than}} the truth, and could thoroughly enjoy the story which he was telling with so much of pleasure.|$|R
60|$|The {{signs of}} wrath {{did not appear}} to me very obvious, but <b>I</b> {{afterwards}} <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that, in an ostrich, a small amount of demonstration means an extreme depth of anger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] she said, [...] "you owe {{so much to}} {{that girl}} in the Bush! She would always have come between us. I think you made me {{recognize}} it when {{you told me about}} her, though it was only by degrees <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> it clearly." ...|$|E
60|$|Now it was <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{that the}} rain was {{beginning}} to fall; the wind came in spiteful gusts, betokening a storm, and I could have hugged myself with glee {{at the thought that}} the elements were favoring us in the attempt which, at the outset, had seemed doomed to failure.|$|E
60|$|It is {{with shame}} I here {{set down the}} fact, that many weeks passed before <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand,</b> in ever so slight a degree, what a milksop I must be, thus eating the bread of idleness when I should have won the right, by labor, to a {{livelihood}} in this world.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rachel and <b>I</b> have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> each other," [...] said Frank. [...] "She is to {{have the}} {{spending}} of her money by herself, and I by myself am to enjoy life at Morony Castle." ...|$|R
60|$|What {{he meant}} {{was at the}} time a mystery to me. <b>I</b> have since <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{that we must}} {{walk the}} streets of York during all the hours of darkness, and, what was of far more importance, must hold back from {{performing}} that task which the Jerseyman had set us.|$|R
6000|$|... "My babe, Sir James," [...] said Mr Blurt, with ill-concealed pride; [...] "since last I had the {{pleasure}} of seeing you I have been married. Ah! Sir James, `it is not good for man to be alone.' That is a truth with which I was but feebly impressed until <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the blessedness of the wedded state. Words cannot--" ...|$|E
60|$|To my relief <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{that the}} noise grew fainter and fainter as I advanced, and, therefore, was it {{certain that the}} Britishers were not on my trail; but with such {{pleasing}} knowledge came the thought that Hiram might have been shot down, or, failing to continue a true course, was doubling here and there with the pursuers close upon his heels.|$|E
60|$|When I {{was older}} grown, {{and had seen}} more of warfare, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that the life of one man counts for but little when {{compared}} with the general good, and had such fact been impressed upon my mind at this time, I would never have set out on the foolhardy errand which bid fair to lead Paul Sampson and me to our death.|$|E
6000|$|... "From {{all this}} <b>I</b> <b>came</b> {{gradually}} <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{that some of}} the [...] officers were performing their morning ablutions with sponge and [...] towel, while Firebrand was looking languidly over the edge of his [...] hammock, indulging in a critical commentary.|$|R
60|$|ANSWER. Fright not thyself, my book, {{for such}} bugbears Are nothing else but ground for groundless fears. My Pilgrim's book has travell'd sea and land, Yet could <b>I</b> never <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> That it was slighted, or turn'd out of door By any kingdom, were they rich or poor.|$|R
60|$|I had {{not seen}} the lad escaping; he was two or three paces in advance of me when we turned the corner, and the chances were that the poor fellow had been made {{prisoner}} before having had time to realize the danger which we had come upon so suddenly. While one might have counted ten I stood irresolute, wondering whether it was not my duty to learn his fate even at the expense of being captured, in order that I might do something toward aiding him; but then <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that such a course would be sheer folly. I could do nothing toward effecting his release, and it seemed necessary, at whatever hazard, that I make my way to Cambridge according to orders.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] {{continued}} the sailor, [...] "I {{came out from}} a great and rich country, called England, in one o' these big tradin' canoes, which was wrecked close to the settlements, and there I stayed with my mates, waiting for another big kayak to come an' take us off; but no kayak came for two winters--so that's the way <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> an' speak the Eskimo--" ...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not believe}} Pierre {{was in the right}} when he said {{we might be able to}} defend ourselves. I had in mind that {{instantly}} the retreat was begun all the red-coated men would hasten upon the heels of their comrades lest they be left behind; but fortunately, as <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> later, I did not protest against following Pierre out of the cabin, although my stomach revolted when we were come to that scene of slaughter.|$|E
60|$|Before {{many minutes}} had passed <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{that there was}} certain danger of our failing in this the first real work which had been given us to do, for as the lads {{discussed}} the matter they {{became more and more}} impressed with the idea of hoodwinking the traitorous Tory and the lobster backs at the same time. They began to believe it would be of more importance thus to prove Seth a liar, than to join in the business on which Hiram was engaged.|$|E
60|$|I rejoiced {{when the}} sun began to sink in the west, even though it was, as I believed, {{bringing}} the hour of my death so much the nearer; but <b>I</b> soon <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that Sergeant Corney was not disposed to make the perilous venture without first having taken all possible precautions for our safety.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir; {{but there}} is always the hope of escape or of exchange. When you spoke kindly to me this {{afternoon}} I partly understood what you said, for in this long time I have been on board <b>I</b> have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> a little Spanish, and I thought that maybe you would assist me in some way." ...|$|R
60|$|Paul, who lay {{close by}} my side, {{seemingly}} gave no heed {{to the passage}} of time. Like the brave lad <b>I</b> had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> him <b>to</b> be, he remained apparently indifferent to what the future might hold in store for us, gaining the repose which would serve him in good stead when violent action was required.|$|R
60|$|For the rest, he {{was dead}} and broken up by those Amahagger blood-hounds before I could examine him, or his body-armour either, {{and there was an}} end of him and his story. But when I looked at the corpse of poor Robertson, which I did as we buried it where he fell, and saw that though so large and thick-set, it was cleft almost in two by a single blow of Rezu's axe, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what the might of this savage must have been.|$|E
6000|$|Austin {{showed his}} astonishment this time, and Jefferson smiled. [...] "You can't quite figure how <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{a thing of}} that kind? Well, some of you smart folks have made the same mistake before. You don't seem to {{remember}} when you waste ten minutes working a traverse round what you could say in one, that however you dress it up, human nature's much the same. Now you're astonished at me. I'm talking. Sometimes I feel I have to. You want to know just why she really sent you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm sure he has!' cried Gilbert. 'I am {{sure there}} was spite in his grin when he pulled out that horrid old parchment, with the lines a yard long, and read us out the abominable old crabbed writing, all about the houses, messuages, and tenements thereupon, {{and a lot of}} lawyer's jargon. I'm sure I thought it was left to Peter Pettilove himself. And when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> it, one would have thought it took my father to be the worst enemy we had in the world, bent on {{cheating}} us!' ...|$|E
6000|$|For my part it was needless for Pierre <b>to</b> argue. <b>I</b> had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{before he}} was done with {{speaking}} {{that it would be}} better for him to reconnoitre the ground; that he could learn as much, if not more, than the three of us, meanwhile running comparatively no risk, and when Saul would have argued I cried out impatiently: ...|$|R
3000|$|With the {{reflective}} observations, now <b>I</b> have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{about the different}} varieties of English and that these varieties don’t pop up for no reasons, and there are significant cultural factors that influence the language, it’s an organic process! Even if I, a native-speaker of Australian English, don’t understand other varieties of English like Singaporean English, it doesn’t mean that they are “incorrect” (Ogilvy) [...]...|$|R
60|$|It gave me {{a certain}} {{sensation}} of loneliness to have Darius go at that time. Although {{it was late in}} the day to make such a discovery, <b>I</b> had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> of how much assistance he was to us lads, and how helpless we would be without him; but, as a matter of course, I could not presume to dictate as to his movements.|$|R
