40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} new {{modeling}} method that transforms an infrastructure system with interdependent and correlated facility failures into an equivalent {{one with an}} explicit supporting structure. This structure consists {{of a set of}} supporting stations that are subject to only independent disruptions with identified probabilities, and thus is much easier to characterize and formulate. Such a supporting structure framework is capable of not only providing a mathematical representation of complex <b>facility</b> <b>failure</b> mechanisms but also physically emulating interdependent infrastructures and their inter-connections in many real-world systems. We examine the properties of this structure and find that {{it can be used to}} model a range of heterogeneous and correlated <b>facility</b> <b>failure</b> patterns. A mathematical model built on the supporting structure is created to solve reliable facility location design problems under correlated <b>facility</b> <b>failure</b> risks. This model determines the optimal locations for supporting stations and service facilities to minimize the total system cost including infrastructure investment in the early planning stage and the expected transportation costs and service-loss penalties during the operational stage. This model is formulated into a compact integer linear program and can be efficiently solved by state-of-the-art solvers. A set of experiments and case studies are conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model and to draw managerial insights into the optimal system design...|$|E

The main difference is that the real-time parameters, such as environmental temperature, wind speed, sunshine heat, and load level cannot be obtained in several days or weeks ahead of time. Therefore, the temperature dependent or current dependent models can hardly be incorporated into the mid-short-term risk assessment model. However, on such time horizon the probability of harmful disasters, such as ice storm, lightning storm and bird migration could be forecasted, since these disasters have strong seasonal regularities. These disasters should be considered in the risk assessment because they are the main reasons of the transmission <b>facility</b> <b>failure.</b> Furthermore, the healthiness of the transmission component can also be considered in the mid-short-term risk assessment.

This paper studies the mid-short-term risk assessment methodology considering the impact of the external environment. The relationship model between natural disasters and transmission lines is presented. The conditional outage rate model and the sampling technique are then proposed considering the correlated outage of multiple transmission lines when a disaster happens. The framework of the mid-short-term risk assessment model is outlined. A test case of Jiangxi provincial power grid validates the proposed model. The results show that the model can quantify the impact of disasters on the forced outage rate of transmission component and their outage correlation, and thus effectively revealing the mid-short-term risk of power systems.

Therefore, having reliable systems are essential {{in order to reduce}} risks as well as cost in case of failures. Motivated by the importance of considering the failure in design level, we, in this thesis, focused on problem of locating facilities, allocating demand points to the facilities, and defining the rout among them while considering the complete failure in the elements of the network. The Reliable Location/ Allocation/ Routing Problem (RLARP) formulation which is Mixed Integer Programming model is proposed, taking into account <b>failures</b> in <b>facilities</b> and routs in different scenarios as failure sets. Along with bringing in trustworthy systems, we also contribute an exact decomposition methodology and propose a Column Generation model to tackle the complexity.

To the best of author’s knowledge, the Column Generation technique has not been applied previously to solve RLARP problems in the literature.

At the same time, the existing literature contains very few studies that examine the impact of fortification of facilities for improving network reliability. This dissertation presents three related classes of models that support the design of reliable distribution networks. The models extend the uncapacitated P-median and fixed-charge location models by considering heterogeneous <b>facility</b> <b>failure</b> probabilities, supplier backups, and facility fortification within a finite budget. The first class of models considers binary fortification via linear fortification functions. The second class of models extends binary fortification to partial (continuous) reliability improvement with linear fortification. This extension allows a more efficient utilization of limited fortification resources. The third class of models generalizes linear fortification to nonlinear to reflect the effect of diminishing marginal reliability improvement from fortification investment. For each of the models, we develop solution algorithms and demonstrate their computational efficiency. We present a detailed discussion on the novelty of the proposed models. The models are intended to support corporate decisions on the design of robust distribution networks using limited fortification resources...|$|E

After having demonstrated thrust performance in the range 0. 3 to 200 µN, with a 0. 1 µN resolution throughout the range, the cesium-fed slit-type Field Emission Electric Propulsion (FEEP) thruster had to demonstrate sufficiently extended operation. To this aim, two endurance tests were performed one after another in 2008. Both endurance tests were performed in a full flight-standard configuration. During first endurance test, the thruster cumulated 736 hours of firing time and a total impulse in excess of 260 Ns, before a <b>facility</b> <b>failure</b> interrupted the test. The second endurance test (performed on a thruster identical to the first one) immediately followed the first one. In this case the test went on until the thruster was no more able to drain propellant from its reservoir against gravity, due to the fixed geometrical setup. In the meanwhile, the thruster had cumulated 3228 hours of firing operation and it had generated a total impulse in excess of 950 Ns, i. e. {{very close to the}} qualification limit of 1100 Ns required for Lisa Pathfinder.

Population growth, economic development and diminishing freshwater supplies are posing growing challenges for water supply system planning in many urban areas. Besides the need to exploit alternative water sources to the conventional surface and groundwater supplies, such as reclaimed water, a systematic point of view has to be taken for the efficient management of all potential water resources, so that issues of water supply, storage, treatment and reuse are not considered separately, but rather {{in the context of their}} interactions. The focus of this dissertation is to develop mathematical models and optimization algorithms for water supply system planning, where the interaction of different system components is explicitly considered. A deterministic nonlinear programming model is proposed at first to decide pipe and pump sizes in a regional water supply system for satisfying given potable and non-potable user demands over a certain planning horizon. A branch-and-bound algorithm based on the reformulation-linearization technique is then developed for solving the model to global optimality. To handle uncertainty in the planning process, a stochastic programming (SP) model and a robust optimization (RO) model are successively proposed to deal with random water supply and demand and the risk of <b>facility</b> <b>failure,</b> respectively. Both models attempt to make the decision of building some additional treatment and recharge facilities for recycling wastewater on-the-site. While the objective of the SP model is to minimize the total system design and expected operation cost, the RO model tries to achieve a favorable trade-off between system cost and system robustness, where the system robustness is defined in terms of meeting given user demands against the worst-case failure mode. The Benders decomposition method is then applied for solving both models by exploiting their special structure...|$|E
