40|$|In this paper, we {{examined}} {{the main trends in}} world demand for semiconductor materials. Taking into account the considered trends, at the initial stage a model of a new experimental irradiation volume was constructed, which will allow to obtain ingots of a semiconductor material up to 200 mm in size with high <b>doping</b> <b>accuracy.</b> The next step was to determine the regularities of the FA location in the core, in order to obtain the conditions for the maximum effective flow of NTD in the new experimental channel. In addition, an assessment was made of the influence of regulatory authorities on the course of NTD...|$|E
40|$|International audienceConcentration {{quenching}} {{is a major}} {{impediment to}} efficient organic light-emitting devices. We herein report on Organic Light-Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) based on a fluorescent amorphous red-emitting starbust triarylamine molecule (4 -di(4 '-tert-butylbiphenyl- 4 -yl) amino- 4 '-dicyanovinylbenzene, named FVIN), exhibiting a very small sensitivity to concentration quenching. OLEDs are fabricated with various doping levels of FVIN into Alq 3, and show a remarkably stable external quantum efficiency of 1. 5 % for doping rates ranging from 5 % up to 40 %, which strongly relaxes the technological constraints on the <b>doping</b> <b>accuracy.</b> An efficiency of 1 % is obtained for a pure undoped active region, along with deep red emission (x= 0. 6; y= 0. 35 CIE coordinates). A comparison of FVIN with the archetypal DCM dye is presented in an identical multilayer OLED structure...|$|E
40|$|A {{calculation}} of the spin-wave polarization operator {{is very important for}} the analysis of the magnetic structure of high temperature superconductors. We analyze the significance of the incoherent part of the spin-wave polarization operator {{within the framework of the}} t-J model. This part is calculated analytically for small <b>doping</b> with logarithmic <b>accuracy.</b> We conclude that the incoherent part of the spin-wave polarization operator is negligible in comparison with the coherent part.

40|$|To realize optimum performance, SiGe HBTs are {{typically}} designed with heavily doped implanted collectors. For practical circuits operating at either high collector current density (Jc) or high collector-base voltage (Vcb) avalanche multiplication {{is an important}} effects that must be accurately measured and modeled. For example in digital applications, the avalanche multiplication factor (M- 1) determines the breakdown voltage, which in turn determines the maximum power supply for stable logic operation. In critical RF circuits such as power amplifiers (PA) and low noise amplifiers (LNA), the base-collector junction avalanche multiplication degrades the linearity of the circuit because of the resulting strong non-linear feedback from the output (collector) to input (base) is particularly the case for state-of-art high-performance transistors featuring high collector <b>doping.</b> Therefore the <b>accuracy</b> of avalanche multiplication models in different operational conditions is critical to devices design of high linearity LNA and PA circuits. In this thesis, the temperature dependence of the avalanche current in Mextram compact model is addressed through extensive DC measurements over temperature on advanced industrial SiGe HBTs, {{it was discovered that}} the current local-electric field based avalanche current model in the Mextram model is incapable of describing the avalanche current as a function of device temperature. This setback is the key motivation behind the work in this thesis. By employing the simplified energy-balance equation, the impact ionization rate was expressed in terms of the carrier (electron for NPN HBT) energy or temperature (Te). Here a triangular shaped electric field distribution corresponding to the normal forward operation regime was assumed. Taking the integral of the electron temperature dependent ionization rate over the epilayer yielded the non-local multiplication factor. The product of the multiplication factor with epilayer current gives the non-local avalanche current, which takes non-local avalanche effects into account. The compact formulation of this non-local avalanche current model was derived and implemented at Delft University of Technology in the in-house version of Mextram compact model. An extended experimental verification of the new compact model for the non-local avalanche current implemented in Mextram was carried out for different advanced SiGe HBT technologies; and the results are presented in this thesis. Verification results showed that the non-local avalanche current model can accurately describe the avalanche current as a function of temperature for different SiGe HBTs (both NPN and PNP). These results implies that the observed setback in Mextram model with respect to the temperature dependence of the avalanche current can be fully addressed by taking non-local avalanche effects into account.
