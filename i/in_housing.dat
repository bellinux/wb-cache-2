5|$|As {{the houses}} in the Ghetto age, and {{as the number of}} {{students}} wishing to live in the Ghetto expands, the university has begun a renovation and replacement program with the goal of keeping the current feel of the area intact. In 2000, construction began on several new duplexes to fill land that was unused, resulting <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> for several dozen additional students. The duplexes housed six students per side, for a total of 12 students each. In 2003, the university continued the project by tearing down several houses on Stonemill Road and replacing them with a new five-person design. Several more of these houses have now been built throughout the Ghetto.|$|E

5|$|Basingstoke's {{expansion}} has absorbed much surrounding farmland {{and scattered}} housing, transforming it into housing estates or local districts. Many {{of these new}} estates are designed as almost self-contained communities, such as Lychpit, Chineham, Popley, Winklebury, Oakridge, Kempshott, Brighton Hill, Viables, South Ham, Black Dam, Buckskin and Hatch Warren. The M3 acts as a buffer zone {{to the south of}} the town, and the South Western Main Line constrains the western expansion, with a green belt to the north and north-east, making Basingstoke shaped almost like a kite. As a result, the villages of Cliddesden, Dummer, Sherborne St John and Oakley, although being very close to the town limits, are considered distinct entities. Popley, Hatch Warren and Beggarwood are seeing rapid growth <b>in</b> <b>housing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bristol in {{the early}} 1960s had an {{estimated}} 3,000 residents of West Indian origin, some who {{had served in the}} British military during World War II and some who had emigrated to Britain more recently.

On 18 May 1941, he married Doris Isabel Parker (1920â€“2003), an old friend {{who worked as a}} clerk and who, like Hollamby, {{was a member of the}} Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). Their wedding took place at St Michael's Church at Tokyngton, Middlesex, after which they moved to St. Peter's Square, Hammersmith. They went on to have two daughters and a son. In August 1941, during Britain's involvement in World War II, Hollamby was called up to serve in the British armed forces. Assigned to the Royal Marine Engineers, he served most of the conflict in Trincomalee, Ceylon.|$|E

5|$|Poisonous {{bromomethane}} {{was widely}} used as pesticide to fumigate soil and to fumigate housing, by the tenting method. Ethylene bromide was similarly used. These volatile organobromine compounds are all now regulated as ozone depletion agents. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer scheduled the phase {{out for the}} ozone depleting chemical by 2005, and organobromide pesticides are no longer used (<b>in</b> <b>housing</b> fumigation they {{have been replaced by}} such compounds as sulfuryl fluoride, which contain neither the chlorine or bromine organics which harm ozone).

5|$|The Catholic Church, whose {{traditional}} membership {{was most}} affected by the changes <b>in</b> <b>housing,</b> {{was the first to}} react to this situation, creating 76 new parishes between 1845 and 1960 in the west of the country alone. The Baptist and Episcopalian churches followed close behind, particularly in the new towns. Within the Church of Scotland, the closeness of congregation and clergy was expressed in the domestic plainness of 1950s dual-use hall churches, as at Reiach's Kildrum Parish Church, Cumbernauld (completed 1962), a steel framed building, clad in timber and brick with a flat roof. Of 129 buildings erected by the Church of Scotland between 1948 and 1959, 108 were on this basic pattern.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, {{members of}} Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni {{provided}} $2,500 {{to the town}} of Iwakuni toward cleanup and disaster relief. Soldiers also helped nearby residents and farmers to complete the rice harvest, after floods from the typhoon damaged harvesting machines. The local government of Iwakunda distributed disinfectant chemicals to flooded houses. Closed markets and decreased supplies caused the price of beef to reach record levels in the country. Following the storm, the General Insurance Association of Japan reported that insurance claims from the typhoon totaled Â¥58.8billion (US$53million), the tenth-highest for any natural disaster in the country. Miyazaki Prefecture reported the highest claims with Â¥12.6billion (US$11.4million). The total was split between Â¥49billion (US$44million) <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> claims and Â¥7.9billion (US$71million) in car claims.

5|$|The {{geologic}} formations {{that have}} the most influence on the Everglades are the Miami Limestone and the Fort Thompson Formation. The Miami Limestone forms {{the floor of the}} lower Everglades. The Miami Limestone is made up of ooids: tiny formations of egg-shaped concentric shells and calcium carbonate, formed around a single grain of sand. The Miami Limestone was formerly named the Miami Oolite, which comprises facies of ooids and fossilized bryozoan organisms. The unique structure was some of the first material used <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> in early 20th-century South Florida. The composition of this sedimentary formation affects the hydrology, plant life, and wildlife above it: the rock is especially porous and stores water during the dry season in the Everglades, and its chemical composition determines the vegetation prevalent in the region. The Miami Limestone also acts as a dam between Fort Lauderdale and Coot Bay.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} {{was faced with}} the reawakening of labor-management conflicts that had lain dormant during the war years, severe shortages <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> and consumer products, and widespread dissatisfaction with inflation, which at one point hit 6% in a single month. Added to this polarized environment was a wave of destabilizing strikes in major industries. Truman's response to them was generally seen as ineffective. A rapid increase in costs was fueled by the release of price controls on most items, and labor sought wage increases. A serious steel strike in January 1946 involving 800,000 workersâ€”the largest in the nation's historyâ€”was followed by a coal strike in April and a rail strike in May. The public was angry, with a majority in polls favoring a ban on strikes by public service workers and a year's moratorium on labor actions. For commodities where price controls remained, producers were often unwilling to sell at artificially low prices: farmers refused to sell grain for months in 1945 and 1946 until payments were significantly increased, even though grain was desperately needed, not only for domestic use, but to stave off starvation in Europe.|$|E

40|$|Two nearly {{identical}} houses situated {{next to each}} other in Bossier City, Louisiana were studied in an effort to better understand moisture and cooling energy related problems <b>in</b> manufactured <b>houses</b> with low thermostat set-points during the cooling season. By design, the major difference between houses was the type of air conditioning units. House A had a standard split air conditioner and House B had a twospeed split air conditioner. In an effort to make the buildings more similar, the building airtightness was adjusted until it was the same <b>in</b> each <b>house,</b> and duct leaks were sealed so that the ducts were tight and there was equal tightness <b>in</b> both <b>houses.</b> A ventilation system was also added at the same time of duct repair. Duct repair and the ventilation modifications resulted in significant impacts on the cooling energy, temperature, relative humidity, and building pressures. Cooling energy decreased 37 % <b>in</b> <b>House</b> A and 18 % <b>in</b> <b>House</b> B, while the floor space dewpoint increased significantly. It is estimated that 35 % savings was due solely to duct repair <b>in</b> <b>House</b> A and 17 % <b>in</b> <b>House</b> B. The primary cause of House A savings being twice House B is attributed to House A operating at nearly twice the capacity most of the time and had more duct leakage repaired. This resulted in higher system pressures and therefore greater duct leakage than <b>in</b> <b>House</b> B. Before building modifications, House A used 15. 4 kWh per day (32 %) more than House B and 3. 4 kWh per day (11 %) more after modifications. A method of characterizing interstitial spaces using dewpoint measurement is presented and shows that the belly space became 2. 6 times more like outdoor conditions after repairs <b>in</b> <b>House</b> A and 2. 0 times more <b>in</b> <b>House</b> B...|$|R
