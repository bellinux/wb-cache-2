For the 2017 election, {{based on the number of}} electors as at 28 August 2017, {{the election}} expenses limit was $754,982.40. <b>It</b> <b>amounts</b> to an illegal practice to pay to transport voters to or from the poll; or to pay a voter for the use of premises to display a notice, unless the voter is an advertising agent or the transaction is carried out in the ordinary course of business. It is also an illegal practice for a person to borrow or lend, hire or rent out, or use any motor vehicle to convey voters other than himself and his family members to or from the poll. Committing an illegal practice is a criminal offence, the penalty for which is a fine of up to $2,000 and disqualification for three years from being a voter or a candidate for Parliament or the office of President.|$|E

25|$|The rest of {{the country}} is also still {{emerging}} from the sea. The weight of the continental glaciers depressed the land over which they moved, and even now, a hundred centuries after their recession, Finland is rising up from this great load through the process of isostatic rebound. In the south and the southwest, this process is occurring slowly, at a rate of twenty-five to thirty centimetres a century. Farther north in the Ostrobothnia area, uplift is more rapid, <b>it</b> <b>amounts</b> to eighty or ninety centimetres a century. The process also means that Finland is growing about seven square kilometres yearly as land emerges from the sea.|$|E

The share of households taxed in 2005 was 66.8%. The number of indebted taxpayers of the wealth tax is two hundred and twelve.

25|$|Emmett J. Roe, {{owner of}} Imperial Foods Products Inc.; his son Brad, who was {{operations}} {{manager for the}} company; and plant manager James N. Hair surrendered on March 13, 1992, and were charged with non-negligent manslaughter. There was no trial. On September 15, 1992, owner Emmett Roe pleaded guilty to 25 counts of involuntary manslaughter. No one else was found guilty. Emmett Roe had personally ordered the doors to be locked from the outside. He received a prison sentence of 19 years and 11 months. The sentence was unpopular among many of the workers and their families who point out that <b>it</b> <b>amounts</b> to {{less than a year}} for each dead person. Roe became eligible for parole in March 1994, and was released just under four years into his sentence.|$|E
25|$|From 2000 to 2010, the United States Census Bureau {{reported}} that Mississippi {{had the highest}} rate of increase in people identifying as mixed-race, up 70 percent in the decade; <b>it</b> <b>amounts</b> to a total of 1.1 percent of the population. In addition, Mississippi led the nation {{for most of the last}} decade in the growth of mixed marriages among its population. The total population has not increased significantly, but is young. Some of the above change in identification as mixed race is due to new births. But, it appears mostly to reflect those residents who have chosen to identify as more than one race, who in earlier years may have identified by just one ethnicity. A binary racial system had been in place since slavery times and the days of racial segregation. In the civil rights era, people of African descent banded together in an inclusive community to achieve political power and gain restoration of their civil rights.|$|E
25|$|However, the Oytser fun der yidisher shprakh, {{which was}} {{arranged}} onomastically, is undisputedly Stutchkoff’s main achievement. It remains even today {{the most extensive}} dictionary of the Yiddish language, containing approximately 90,000 single-word entries and 8,000 idioms (because of multiple designations <b>it</b> <b>amounts</b> to nearly 175,000 entries). The dictionary was meant to ‘store’ the Yiddish language, which {{was in danger of}} extinction after the Holocaust. Peter Mark Roget’s English thesaurus served as an example; nonetheless, Stutchkoff reduced Roget’s 1000 onomastic categories to 650. The dictionary received critical acclaim and 2000 copies were sold within the first year of its publication alone. It does not project purist language views; instead it includes 1500 Americanisms, 3000 Germanisms, 1000 Slavisms, 500 vulgarisms, 700 funny expressions, and 700 archaisms, dialectal words, slang words and Sovietisms. This inclusion of modern lexicon distinguished Stutchkoff’s dictionary from other publications put out by the Institute for Jewish Research YIVO (Yidisher visnshaftlekher institut). Stutchkoff’s decision to include those terms went against the advice of his publisher, Max Weinreich. However, some reviewers – among others Isaac Bashevis Singer – criticised the fact that Weinreich had designated certain terms as “not recommended”, while others regretted that the Oytser included many artificial terms invented by the YIVO that were not in use in other circles.|$|E

25|$|An {{application}} {{for permission to}} bring a judicial review was made by Lutfur Rahman in July 2015, with a hearing held on 26 January 2016. The application {{was made in the}} hopes of reducing Rahman incapacity from holding elective office from five years to three years. While maintaining that many of the election court findings are wrong, the application acknolwedged that challenges may only be made on those conclusions which amount to error of law. The court findings that canvassers were paid in contravention of section 111 of the 1983 Act, and that Rahman is guilty of bribery personally and by his agent in contravention of section 113 were challenged on the basis that they were reached without any sufficient evidence such that <b>it</b> <b>amounts</b> to an error of law, and that the Commissioner erred when interpretating the provision on bribery. A challenge was made to the finding of undue spiritual influence on the basis that the Commissioner conclusion was in contravention to authority, and incompatible with Article 9 or Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, or both. The divisional court of Lloyd LJ and Supperstone J granted Rahman permission to launch a judicial review on the undue spiritual influence finding because the law had not been tested for over a century, but rejected the other two challenges, as a result leaving in place Rahman's five years ban from elective office even if he is successful in a judicial review. The judicial review application was closed following the non-payment of court fee.|$|E

500|$|The Cantos is {{difficult}} to decipher. In the epic poem, Pound disregards literary genres, mixing satire, hymns, elegies, essays and memoirs. Pound scholar Rebecca Beasley believes <b>it</b> <b>amounts</b> to {{a rejection of the}} 19th-century nationalistic approach in favor of early-20th-century comparative literature. Pound reaches across cultures and time periods, assembling and juxtaposing [...] "themes and history" [...] from Homer to Ovid and Dante, from Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, and many others. The work presents a multitude of protagonists as [...] "travellers between nations". The nature of The Cantos, she says, is to compare and measure among historical periods and cultures and against [...] "a Poundian standard" [...] of modernism.|$|E
