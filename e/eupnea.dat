When a mammal perceives potential danger, <b>eupnea</b> stops, and a much more limited and labored form of breathing occurs.|$|E
50|$|In the {{mammalian}} respiratory system, <b>eupnea</b> or eupnoea is normal, good, unlabored breathing, sometimes {{known as}} quiet breathing or resting respiratory rate. In <b>eupnea,</b> expiration employs only the elastic recoil of the lungs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eupnea</b> is an {{efficient}} and effective form of breathing, which maximizes air intake, and minimizes muscular effort.|$|E
50|$|During <b>eupnea,</b> neural {{output to}} {{respiratory}} muscles is highly regular, with rhythmic bursts of activity during inspiration {{only to the}} diaphragm and external intercostal muscles.|$|E

50|$|Diaphragmatic {{breathing}}, or deep {{breathing is}} breathing {{that is done}} by contracting the diaphragm, a muscle located horizontally between the thoracic cavity and abdominal cavity. Air enters the lungs and the chest rises and the belly expands during this type of breathing.Diaphragmatic breathing is also known scientifically as <b>eupnea,</b> which is a natural and relaxed form of breathing in all mammals. <b>Eupnea</b> occurs in mammals whenever {{they are in a}} state of relaxation, i.e. when there is no clear and present danger in their environment.|$|E
50|$|The {{rhythm of}} the DRG {{produces}} a respiratory rate of 12-16 breaths per minute in humans. Inspiration usually lasts approximately 2 seconds, and expiration lasts about 3 seconds. The normal inspiration rate and rhythm is called <b>eupnea,</b> and difficult respiration is termed dyspnea.|$|E
5000|$|The pre-Bötzinger complex {{produces}} {{two types}} of breathing rhythms under normal levels of oxygen. In <b>eupnea,</b> or normal breathing, the pre-BötC generates a rhythm that is fast and low in amplitude. [...] Sighs, on the other hand, consist of a slow and large amplitude rhythm. Each type of rhythm is generated by the same neurons in the pre-Bötzinger complex, but through different mechanisms, receptors, and ion currents that are controlled by changes in the behavior or environment of the organism. Under low levels of oxygen, the pre-Bötzinger complex needs to rearrange the activity of its neurons and requires the assistance of other brain structures, like the pons, to generate gasping. Gasping {{is characterized by a}} rhythm that has faster rise, shorter bursts, and lower frequency.|$|E
50|$|Located {{within the}} ventrolateral medulla, the pre-Bötzinger complex {{contains}} subnetworks that hold distinct synapses and intrinsic membrane properties. In mammals, the respiratory network {{system and the}} nuclei controlling breathing modulation are found along the neuronal axis. The neuronal networks involved in respiratory function {{are located in the}} ventral respiratory column (VRC). From rostral to caudal, these networks include the retrotrapezoid nucleus/parafacial respiratory group complex (RTN/pFRG), the Bötzinger complex, the pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BötC), the rostral ventral respiratory group (rVRG), and the caudal VRG (cVRG). The dorsal pons, including the Kolliker-Fuse nucleus and the parabrachial complex, {{play an important role in}} respiratory control and rhythm generation. Other areas that aid in breathing control are the cerebellum, neocortex, and the periaqueductal gray (speech and breathing). The generation and modulation of <b>eupnea</b> and the transition between the inspiratory and expiratory phases have also been implicated in respiratory rhythm generation.|$|E

An open glottis was maintained during apnea at the resting respiratory level. The Q values were positively correlated with the respiratory frequency, decreasing from <b>eupnea</b> to apnea and increasing from <b>eupnea</b> to tachypnea (P< 0. 05).

40|$|If normal, eupneic {{breathing}} fails, gasping is recruited. Serotonin {{was proposed}} as essential for gasping, based on findings using an in vitro mouse preparation. This preparation generates rhythmic {{activities of the}} hypoglossal nerve that {{are considered to be}} akin to both <b>eupnea</b> and gasping. In previous studies, gasping of in situ rat and mouse preparations continued unabated following blockers of receptors for serotonin. However, hypoglossal activity was not recorded in the mouse, and we hypothesized that its discharge during gasping might be dependent on serotonin. In the in situ mouse preparation, hypoglossal discharge had varying and inconsistent patterns during <b>eupnea,</b> discharging concomitant with the phrenic burst, at varying intervals between phrenic bursts, or was silent in some respiratory cycles. In <b>eupnea,</b> phrenic discharge was incrementing, whereas hypoglossal discharge was decrementing in 15 of 20 preparations. During ischemia-induced gasping, peak phrenic height was reached at 205 ± 17 ms, compared with 282 ± 27. 9 ms after the start of the eupneic burst (P < 0. 002). In contrast, rates of rise of hypoglossal discharge in gasping (peak at 233 ± 25 ms) and <b>eupnea</b> (peak at 199 ± 19. 2 ms) were the same. The uncoupling of hypoglossal from phrenic discharge in <b>eupnea</b> was exacerbated by methysergide, an antagonist of serotonin receptors.

Using the in situ arterially perfused juvenile rat preparation, we investigated whether the shift from <b>eupnea</b> to gasping was associated with a reconfiguration of the spatiotemporal pattern of respiratory neuronal activity in the ventral medullary respiratory network. Optical images of medullary respiratory network activity were obtained from male rats (4 – 6 weeks of age). Part of the medullary network was stained with a voltage-sensitive dye (di- 2 ANEPEQ) centred both within, and adjacent to, the pre-Bötzinger complex (Pre-BötC). During <b>eupnea,</b> optical signals initially increased prior to the onset of phrenic activity and progressively intensified during the inspiratory phase peaking at the end of inspiration. During early expiration, fluorescence was also detected and slowly declined throughout this phase. In contrast, hypoxia shifted the respiratory motor pattern from <b>eupnea</b> to gasping and optical signals were restricted to inspiration only. Areas active during gasping showed fluorescence that was more intensive and covered a larger region of the rostral ventrolateral medulla compared to <b>eupnea.</b> Regions exhibiting peak inspiratory fluorescence did not coincide spatially during <b>eupnea</b> and gasping. Moreover, there was a recruitment of additional medullary regions during gasping that were not active during <b>eupnea.</b> These results provide novel evidence that the shift in respiratory motor pattern from <b>eupnea</b> to gasping appears to be associated with a reconfiguration of the central respiratory rhythm generator characterized by changes in its spatiotemporal organization...|$|E

However, it is not well understood how postinspiration is organized in the diaphragm, i. e., whether postinspiration differs in the crural and costal segments of the diaphragm and what the influence is of postinspiratory neurons on diaphragm function during <b>eupnea.</b> In this in vivo study we investigated the postinspiratory activity of the two diaphragm segments during <b>eupnea</b> and the changes in diaphragm function following modulation of <b>eupnea.</b> Postinspiratory neurons in the medulla were stereotaxically localized extracellularly and neurochemically stimulated. We used three types of preparations: precollicularly decerebrated unanesthetized cats and rats and anesthetized rats. In all preparations, during <b>eupnea,</b> postinspiratory activity {{was found in the}} crural but not in the costal diaphragm. When <b>eupnea</b> was discontinued in decerebrate cats in which stimulation in the nucleus retroambiguus induced activation of laryngeal or abdominal muscles, all postinspiratory activity in the crural diaphragm was abolished. In decerebrate rats, stimulation of the midbrain periaqueductal gray abolished postinspiration in the crural diaphragm but induced activation in the costal diaphragm. In anesthetized rats, stimulation of medullary postinspiratory neurons abolished the postinspiratory activity of the crural diaphragm. Vagal nerve stimulation in these rats increased the intensity of postinspiratory neuronal discharge in the solitary nucleus, leading to decreased activity of the crural diaphragm. These data demonstrate that three-phase breathing in the crural diaphragm during <b>eupnea</b> exists in vivo and that postinspiratory neurons have an inhibitory effect on crural diaphragm function...|$|E

Specific criteria can then be derived from the physiological identification of neurobiological mechanisms underlying identified dyspneic patterns, by exaggerating (pro-dyspneic mechanisms) or suppressing them (anti-dyspneic mechanisms).

Methods We used continuous wavelet transform and short time Fourier transform methods {{to examine the}} similarity of breathing patterns in both time and frequency domains during early maturation. The phrenic neurogram was recorded during <b>eupnea,</b> severe hypoxia, and recovery from severe hypoxia in piglets in three different age groups: 3 – 6 days, 10 – 15 days and 29 – 35 days. Results During {{the first week of}} postnatal age, respiratory patterns of phrenic activity were marked by frequency components between 30 and 300 Hz during both the early (first half) and late (second half) phases of the neurogram signals during <b>eupnea.</b> The results suggest that there is little difference between the respiratory patterns in both time and frequency domains during <b>eupnea</b> compared to gasping for the first week of postnatal age in piglets. After the first week of postnatal age, the duration of the phrenic neurogram burst significantly increases and the patterns during the early phase of the phrenic neurogram are different from those observed for gasping. However, the patterns that mark the late phase of the phrenic neurograms are still the same as those of gasping.

40|$|<b>Eupnea</b> {{is normal}} breathing. If <b>eupnea</b> fails, as in severe hypoxia or ischemia, gasping is recruited. Gasping {{can serve as}} a {{powerful}} mechanism for autoresuscitation. A failure of autoresuscitation has been proposed as a basis of the sudden infant death syndrome. In an in vitro preparation, endogenous serotonin is reported to be essential for expression of gasping. Using an in situ preparation of the Pet- 1 knockout mouse, we evaluated such a critical role for serotonin. In this mouse, the number of serotonergic neurons is reduced by 85 – 90 % compared with animals without this homozygous genetic defect. Despite this {{reduction in the number of}} serotonergic neurons, phrenic discharge in <b>eupnea</b> and gasping of Pet- 1 knockout mice was not different from that of wild-type mice. Indeed, gasping continued unabated, even after administration of methysergide, a blocker of many types of receptors for serotonin, to Pet- 1 knockout mice. We conclude that serotonin is not critical for expression of gasping. The proposal for such a critical role, on the basis of observations in the in vitro slice preparation, may reflect the minimal functional neuronal tissue and neurotransmitters in this preparation, such that the role of any remaining neurotransmitters is magnified. Also, rhythmic activity of the in vitro slice preparation has been characterized as <b>eupnea</b> or gasping solely on the basis of activity of the hypoglossal nerve or massed neuronal activities of the ventrolateral medulla.

40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to {{characterize}} the pontile components of the brain stem ventilatory control system in rats. This study was precipitated by reports that this pontile component might differ fundamentally from that of other species. Efferent activity of the phrenic nerve was recorded in anesthetized, vagotomized, paralyzed, and ventilated adult rats. As in other species, electrical stimulations of the rostral pons caused premature terminations and/or onsets of phrenic activity in <b>eupnea.</b> Electrolytic lesions of rostrolateral pons resulted in apneusis, characterized by significant prolongations of the phrenic burst. Some effective lesions were {{in the region of}} the nucleus parabrachialis medialis and the Kolliker-Fuse nucleus, the site of the pneumotaxic center. Other lesions resulting in apneusis were ventral to the pneumotaxic center. As in cats, lesions in the caudal pontile reticular formation caused the duration of the apneustic neural inspiration to return toward that of <b>eupnea.</b> Again, as in other species, gradual alterations from <b>eupnea</b> to gasping in the rat were recorded during hypoxia, which was induced by ventilation with carbon monoxide.

The in vivo study showed that the glottis can be extremely variable during breathing and hence influence airflow characteristics. A glottal area widening was quantified during inspiration, with a typical ratio of 3 : 1 as compared to expiration. Airflow rate variations differ from harmonic signal during <b>eupnea</b> as well as tachypnea. The correlation between flow-rate and glottal area will be discussed and compared to previous clinical investigations.

40|$|Abstract — We {{introduce}} a closed-loop model of respiratory control incorporating a conductance-based {{central pattern generator}} (CPG), low-pass filtering of CPG output by the respiratory musculature, gas exchange in the lung, metabolic oxygen demand, and chemosensation. The CPG incorporates Butera, Rinzel and Smith (BRS) ’s (1999) conditional pacemaker model. BRS model cells can support quiescent, bursting, or beating activity depending {{on the level of}} excitatory drive; we identify these activity modes with apnea (cessation of breathing), <b>eupnea</b> (normal breathing), and tachypnea (exces-sively rapid breathing). We demonstrate the coexistence of two dynamically stable behaviors in the closed-loop model, corresponding respectively to <b>eupnea</b> and tachypnea. The latter state represents a novel failure mode within a respiratory control model. In addition, the closed-loop system exhibits a form of autoresuscitation: conductances intrinsic to the BRS model buffer the CPG against brief episodes of hypoxia, steering the system away from catastrophic collapse as can occur with tachypnea.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the hypothesis that}} medullary respiratory-related and non-respiratory-related neuronal activities are similarly altered with the 'aspiration reflex', induced by mechanical stimulation of the epipharyngeal mucosa, and gasping, induced by severe hypoxia. Extracellular neuronal activities were recorded in decerebrate, paralyzed and ventilated cats. Phrenic activity and neuronal activities were monitored in <b>eupnea</b> and gasping. Seventy-one unit activities were recorded in the lateral medulla including the nucleus tractus solitorii (NTS), lateral tegmental field (LTF) and the nucleus ambiguus (NA). The respiratory modulation of a neuronal activity was quantified by a η 2 statistic (Orem, J. and Dick, T., 1983, J. Neurophysiol. 50 : 1098 - 1107). The η 2 values of the units ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 93. Inspiratory-related activities with relative high η 2 values (n = 16) were recorded in the region closed to the NTS. Phase-spanning (n = 7) and expiratory related activities (n = 10) were recorded in the ventral medullary region. Units with low η 2 values (n = 29) and with no spontaneous activity (n = 9) in <b>eupnea</b> were recorded {{in the region of}} the LTF. In both 'aspiration reflex and gasping, inspiratory-related activities were augmented and expiratory-related activities were suppressed. Tonic units were activated and additional activities were recruited. The modulation of the neuronal activities to gasping induced by anoxia was identical to that induced by pharyngeal stimulation in either hyperoxia or severe hypoxia. We concluded that medullary gasping mechanism is recruited by pharyngeal stimulation. In addition, the present findings are compatible with the idea that different brainstem mechanisms are responsible for the control of <b>eupnea</b> and gasping. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to determine whether hyperoxia would lower the hypocapnic apneic threshold (AT) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Nasal noninvasive mechanical ventilation was used to induce hypocapnia and subsequent central apnea in healthy subjects during stable NREM sleep. Mechanical ventilation trials were conducted under normoxic (room air) and hyperoxic conditions (inspired Po 2 > 250 Torr) in a random order. The CO 2 reserve was defined as the minimal change in end-tidal Pco 2 (PetCO 2) between <b>eupnea</b> and hypocapnic central apnea. The PetCO 2 of the apnea closest to <b>eupnea</b> was designated as the AT. The hypocapnic ventilatory response was calculated as the change in ventilation below <b>eupnea</b> for a given change in PetCO 2. In nine participants, compared with room air, exposure to hyperoxia was associated with a significant decrease in eupneic PetCO 2 (37. 5 ± 0. 6 vs. 41. 1 ± 0. 6 Torr, P = 0. 001), widening of the CO 2 reserve (− 3. 8 ± 0. 8 vs. − 2. 0 ± 0. 3 Torr, P = 0. 03), and a subsequent decline in AT (33. 3 ± 1. 2 vs. 39. 0 ± 0. 7 Torr; P = 001). The hypocapnic ventilatory response was also decreased with hyperoxia. In conclusion, 1) hyperoxia was associated with a decreased AT and an increase in the magnitude of hypocapnia required for the development of central apnea. 2) Thus hyperoxia may mitigate the effects of hypocapnia on ventilatory motor output by lowering the hypocapnic ventilatory response and lowering the resting eupneic PetCO 2, thereby decreasing plant gain...|$|E
40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to {{characterize}} respiratory-modulated activity of the mylohyoid nerve. Since its motoneurons are in the trigeminal motor nucleus, mylohyoid discharge {{could serve as a}} probe of the role of pontile mechanisms in the generation of respiratory rhythms. Studies were performed in the decerebrate, perfused in situ preparation of the rat. Phrenic discharge was recorded as the index of the respiratory rhythm. In <b>eupnea,</b> the mylohyoid nerve discharged primarily during neural expiration, in the period between phrenic bursts. This expiratory discharge increased greatly in hypoxia and fell in hypercapnia. The hypoxia-induced increase in mylohyoid discharge was due, at least in part, to a direct influence of hypoxia on the brain stem. In ischemia, phrenic discharge increased, and then declined to apnea, which was succeeded by gasping. The mylohyoid nerve discharged tonically during the apneic period, but still declined during each of the phrenic bursts of gasping. This maintenance of a respiratory-modulation of the mylohyoid discharge in gasping supports the concept that a release of medullary mechanisms, rather than a ubiquitous suppression of pontile influences, underlies the neurogenesis of gasping. Results also provide additional support for our conclusion that activity of any single cranial nerve does not provide an accurate index of the type of respiratory rhythm, be it <b>eupnea</b> or gasping...|$|E
40|$|The pre-B&# 246;tzinger complex (preB&# 246;tC), an {{area that}} is {{critical}} for generating breathing (<b>eupnea),</b> gasps and sighs is continuously modulated by catecholamines. These amines and the generation of sighs have also been implicated in the regulation of arousal. Here we studied the catecholaminergic modulation of sighs not only in anesthetized freely breathing mice (in vivo), but also in medullary slice preparations that contain the preB&# 246;tC and that generate fictive eupneic and sigh rhythms in vitro. We demonstrate that activating -noradrenergic receptors (B-NR) specifically increases the frequency of sighs, while <b>eupnea</b> remains unaffected both in vitro and in vivo. B-NR activation specifically increased the frequency of intrinsically bursting pacemaker neurons that rely on persistent sodium current (INap). By contrast, all parameters of bursting pacemakers that rely on the non-specific cation current (ICAN) remained unaffected. Moreover, riluzole, which blocks bursting in INap pacemakers abolished sighs altogether, while flufenamic acid which blocks the ICAN current did not alter the sigh-increasing effect caused by B-NR. Our results suggest that the selective B-NR action of sighs may result from the modulation of INap pacemaker activity and that disturbances in noradrenergic system may contribute to abnormal arousal response. The B-NR action on the preB&# 246;tC may be an important mechanism in modulating behaviors that are specifically associated with sighs, such as the regulation of the early events leading to the arousal response...|$|E

However, connectivity between the PRG and ventral respiratory column (VRC) in computational models has been largely ad hoc. We developed a network model with PRG-VRC connectivity inferred from coordinated in vivo experiments. Neurons were modeled in the “integrate-and-fire” style; some neurons had pacemaker properties derived from the model of Breen et al. We recapitulated earlier modeling results, including reproduction of activity profiles of different respiratory neurons and motor outputs, and their changes under different conditions (vagotomy, pontine lesions, etc.). The model also reproduced characteristic changes in neuronal and motor patterns observed in vivo during fictive cough and during hypoxia in non-rapid eye movement sleep. Our simulations suggested possible mechanisms for respiratory pattern reorganization during these behaviors. The model predicted that network- and pacemaker-generated rhythms could be co-expressed during the transition from gasping to <b>eupnea,</b> producing a combined “burst-ramp” pattern of phrenic discharges. To test this prediction, phrenic activity and multiple single neuron spike trains were monitored in vagotomized, decerebrate, immobilized, thoracotomized, and artificially ventilated cats during hypoxia and recovery.

Recent studies [Brouns, 2007] have shown the relevance of the laryngeal geometry and, more precisely, the impact of glottal aperture on fluid dynamics and aerosol deposition mechanics. In this study we focus on two main objectives: i) determine the glottal dynamics during two breathing conditions (<b>eupnea</b> and tachypnea); ii) predict the influence of both carrier gas and aerosols' properties on the unsteady laryngeal flow and the aerosol deposition, using CFD simulations in a simplified 3 D glottis model during these two breathing conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose was}} to {{characterize}} expiratory neural activities in gasping elicited during the aspiration reflex (AR) in hyperoxia and during hypoxia-induced gasping. In decerebrate, vagotomized and paralyzed cats, we recorded activities of inspiratory and expiratory cranial and spinal nerves. The AR was elicited by touching the epipharyngeal mucosa. In <b>eupnea,</b> spinal expiratory activities were greatly decreased during AR whereas laryngeal expiratory activities were increased. In hypoxia-induced gasping, both the laryngeal and spinal expiratory activities were reduced. All of the inspiratory activities were increased during both gasping and the AR. In addition, neural activities were below control levels following AR; activities gradually recovered to control levels. We conclude that spinal expiratory activities are inhibited during the AR and gasping. Results {{are consistent with the}} concept that medullary mechanisms for gasping are recruited by mechanical stimulation of the epipharynx. In hypoxia-induced gasping, the hypoxia, per se, causes a separate suppression of laryngeal expiratory activities. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{generation}} and shaping of the respiratory motor pattern are {{performed in the}} lower brainstem and involve neuronal interactions within the medulla and between the medulla and pons. A computational model of the ponto-medullary respiratory network has been developed by incorporating existing experimental data on the medullary neural circuits and possible interactions between the medulla and pons. The model reproduces a number of experimental findings concerning alterations of the respiratory pattern following various perturbations/stimulations applied to the pons and pulmonary afferents. The results of modeling support the concept that eupneic respiratory rhythm generation requires contribution of the pons whereas a gasping-like rhythm (and the rhythm observed in vitro) may be generated within the medulla and involve pacemaker-driven mechanisms localized within the medullary pre-Bötzinger Complex. The model and experimental data described support the concept that during <b>eupnea</b> the respiration-related pontine structures control the medullary network mechanisms for respiratory phase transitions, suppress the intrinsic pacemaker-driven oscillations in the pre-BötC and provide inspiration-inhibitory and expiration-facilitatory reflexe...|$|E
40|$|Change of {{the basic}} {{respiratory}} rhythm (<b>eupnea)</b> is a pre-requisite for survival. For example, sudden escape from danger needs rapid shallow breathing, strenuous exercise requires tachypnea for sufficient supply of oxygen and a strong anxiety reaction necessitates gasping. Also for vocalization (and for speech in humans) an important mechanism for survival, respiration has to be changed. The caudal brainstem premotor respiratory centers need input from higher brain centers in order to change respiration according to the surrounding circumstances. One {{of the most important}} of such a higher brain centers is the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG). The PAG co-ordinates motor output, including respiratory changes based on input from limbic, prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex regions. These areas integrate visual, auditory and somatosensory information in the context of basic survival mechanisms and relay the result to the PAG, which has access to respiratory control centers in the caudal brainstem. Through these pathways the PAG can change eupneic respiratory rhythm into the behavior necessary for that specific situation. We present data obtained from the cat and propose a functional framework for the breathing control pathways...|$|E
40|$|In vivo, the augmenting {{pattern of}} {{integrated}} phrenic nerve discharge of <b>eupnea</b> is altered to the decrementing pattern of gasping in severe hypoxia or ischaemia. Identical alterations in phrenic discharge {{are found in}} perfused in situ preparations of the juvenile rat. In this preparation, gasping was produced by equilibration of the perfusate with various levels {{of carbon dioxide and}} oxygen. The duration of the phrenic burst, the interval between bursts and the burst amplitude were not significantly different following equilibration with 21 – 6 %O 2 at 5 % CO 2 or with 0 – 9 % CO 2 at 6 % O 2, with the exception that the burst amplitude was significantly greater in hypercapnic-hypoxia (9 % CO 2 at 6 % O 2). It is proposed that hypoxia-induced gasping results from the release of an endogenous pacemaker activity of rostral medullary neurons. This release is caused by cellular mechanisms that change the balance between membrane ionic currents. Moreover, these cellular mechanisms may be explicitly induced by alterations in the ionic an...|$|E
