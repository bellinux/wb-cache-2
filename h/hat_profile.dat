The Mexican <b>hat</b> <b>profile</b> of connectivity which they assume leads to a more broadly tuned inhibition, which suppresses the mean, and to a sharper tuning of excitatory input, which amplifies the modulation.

40|$|The {{processing}} and component properties of metals {{have led to}} their worldwide success in mechanical engineering. Their advantages are high ductility, efficient production methods, good joining ability and nearly isotropic mechanical properties. Fiber-reinforced plastics (FRP) are known for an excellent lightweight design potential, due to low density as well as high and anisotropic tensile stiffness. By using thermoplastics instead of thermoset matrices, processing times and therefore component costs have already been reduced significantly and thus have become affordable in large-scale application. If the advantages of both, metal and FRP, are intelligently combined, a part with tailored properties is created. However, suitable forming processes, which take the different forming effects of both materials into account, have to be developed yet. The scope {{of this research was}} to enable the combined forming, joining and impregnation of pre-impregnated FRP-sheets and sheet metal to steel-CFRP-steel-sandwich-parts in one process step. As forming and joining must be executed at temperatures above the melting point of the thermoplastic while the part removal must take place beneath this temperature, a heating concept for drawing tools was developed to enable short production cycles. In order to ensure an economic industrial production a fast heating and cooling of the tool is essential. Afterwards optimal impregnation and joining process parameters for short cycle times were determined with planar samplings. The influence of the process parameters on part quality was investigated microscopically. Based on this research, a forming tool was constructed and <b>hat</b> <b>profiles</b> of steel-FRP-steel sandwiches were drawn successfully.

40|$|New {{demands for}} {{passenger}} safety, vehicle performance and fuel economy {{have led to}} an increase in the use of advanced high strength steel. An increase in strength decreases the formability of the material and increases the spring back behaviour. Recently the development of high strength steel has rapidly advanced, requiring verification of earlier material models suitable for describing the plasticity behaviour in sheet metal forming. The aim of the here conducted numerical simulations is to verify the deep drawing process and the shape of the final component of a simple <b>hat</b> <b>profile</b> geometry for studying spring-back of high strength steels. Four advanced high strength steels were selected for detailed investigation, namely the dual phase steels DP 600 and DP 750, the triple phase steel TRIP 700 and the stainless steel HYTENS 800. The plastic properties of these steels have been assessed through intrinsic and simulative tests, leading to verification and comparison at different levels. The <b>hat</b> <b>profile</b> serves as a simple test geometry for deep drawing due to elimination of the lateral dimension in first order. The corresponding simpler plasticity behaviour in space facilitates systematic analysis Experiments and simulations were carried out, leading to comparison of the resulting draw in, strain, thinning, final shape and spring-back. The verification and analysis concerns the friction coefficient, two software codes, Finite Element properties and the two material models Hill 48 and Hill 90. The simulation provides a good qualitative coincidence with experimental results, which enables to develop a process theory and to study the individual mechanisms involved. The friction coefficient, varied from 0 to 0. 1, shows very low sensitivity on the process. The simulation underestimates the spring-back by 8 - 12 ° at the flange edge. Among the four materials studied basically the stainless steel HYTENS 800 shows the largest deviations during comparison. In general the results partially reveal distinct quantitative discrepancies, in particular in the critical bending regions, demanding for improved material models and better knowledge of the boundary conditions.

30|$|As we were {{primarily}} {{interested in the}} emergence of orientation selectivity in species without orientation maps, we studied here random networks with salt-and-pepper structure. However, the model could be extended to networks with spatial or functional maps, which imply feature specific connections. As opposed to the Mexican <b>hat</b> <b>profile</b> assumed in the ring model, if one now assumes a more realistic pattern of local inhibition and longer range excitation, different dynamic properties might follow (Hansen et al. 2012; McLaughlin et al. 2000; Pernice et al. 2011). The analysis of the new regime of orientation selectivity therefore calls for a further study. The results of this modeling would in turn help identifying the basic mechanisms that are responsible for the emergence of orientation selectivity in different species with different structures, and to eventually provide an answer to the question whether common design principles exist, or whether different strategies have been recruited by different species.|$|E

Initially evolving a top <b>hat</b> <b>profile,</b> we find that the density threshold for collapse depends significantly on the initial conditions imposed, specifically the choice of size and shape.

40|$|The {{measured}} {{values of the}} Higgs and top quark masses imply that the Standard Model potential is very likely to be unstable at large Higgs values. This is particularly problematic during inflation, which sources large perturbations of the Higgs. The instability could be cured by a threshold effect induced by a scalar with a large vacuum expectation value and directly connected to the Standard Model through a Higgs portal coupling. However, we find that in a minimal model in which the scalar generates inflation, this mechanism does not stabilize the potential because the mass required for inflation is beyond the instability scale. This conclusion does not change if the Higgs has a direct weak coupling to the scalar curvature. On the other hand, if the potential is absolutely stable, successful inflation in agreement with current CMB data can occur along a valley of the potential with a Mexican <b>hat</b> <b>profile.</b> We revisit the stability conditions, independently of inflation, and clarify that the threshold effect cannot work if the Higgs portal coupling is too small.

40|$|When a {{laser beam}} is scanned a {{temperature}} profile is induced in the workpiece. The temperature distribution will {{be a function of}} the beam shape and intensity profile. The use of a circular beam leads to an uneven temperature distribution even when a top <b>hat</b> <b>profile</b> is used. This is caused by the material on the centreline of the beam getting irradiated for longer than an area towards the edge. The uneven temperature distribution will lead to a difference across the weld or deposition in terms of the temperature reached and the rate of cooling. Typically the weld will see a slower cooling rate and maximum temperature along the centreline. This leads to large columnar crystal growth, similar to a cast microstructure with an associated reduction in mechanical performance. A novel method for controlling time-temperature distribution in the material is {{through the use of a}} Holographic Optical Element (HOE). The HOE is a computer generated kinoform diffraction pattern that redistributes the beam intensity and shape into any customer designed profile. Through the use of a predictive non-linear thermal model the desired temperature distribution throughout the interaction region was input, and then propagated to the surface. This surface temperature profile was then converted to be the output of the kinoform beam shaping algorithm. This beam shape forms a complex and non intuitive beam profile allowing a controlled time-temperature profile, that can only be achieved in this way. The weld deposition process has been analysed using colour high speed video and optical pyrometry based techniques. This has shown the levels of material transport in the melt pool to be drastically reduced by the DOE redesign of the input beam shape. This is indicative of a reduced thermal gradient in the melt pool, leading to greater control of the deposition microstructure...|$|E

Mostly, MLC design is regarded as the one influenceable parameter. However, also penumbra can be varied by choosing different distances between the source of radiation and the patient. The authors investigate the distance- dependent penumbra effects of idealized collimators as well as for real 5 mm MLCs. Test objects are small spherical targets of varying diameters to be irradiated under differing prescription conditions. A method to calculate exact stereotactic radial dose distributions from beam profiles or 2 D dose distributions of single beams is developed for circular and MLC shaped targets. Also, a planning study is performed using a Pinnacle 3 ™ planning system. Also, in a theoretical analysis perfect top <b>hat</b> <b>profile</b> beams and beams with varying penumbra are compared for better understanding of penumbra effects with respect to radial dose distributions. It is shown, that the penumbra changes for small targets are more relevant than the beam shaping by 5 mm MLCs. Quasi-isotropic irradiated MLC shaped (quadratic) beams at virtual SAD 700 mm produce steeper radial dose decrease than ideal circular beam shapes with a penumbra typical for SAD 1000 mm. A reduced source-to-patient distance allows better sparing of healthy tissue because of two reasons: The smaller effective leaf width but even more due to steeper penumbra. First, the authors suggest for future recommendations on stereotactic irradiations to specify not only MLC widths but also penumbra characteristics. Second, a so-called “virtual isocentre” could be useful {{to take advantage of the}} penumbra effect: Dependent on gantry angle and isocentric couch angle, the couch should be steered automatically in a way that the central axes of all beams always intersect in the same point at the same distance from the source...|$|E

In contrast to HMX, the addition of binder to TATB in PBX 9502 shows no measurable effect. Porosity effects were considered by comparing the ignition of granular HMX and pressed HMX pellets.

Due to their good specific strength, carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) are employed increasingly. In {{addition to the}} use of unalloyed CFRP components, the material can also be utilized in hybrid composites in order to effectively strengthen mechanically highly loaded components, e. g. structural components or chassis components. Here, too, weight reduction can be achieved by saving material in the metallic component. A time- and cost effective production of hybrid components can be attained if both the joining of the metal- and CFRP components and the manufacturing of the component can be can be performed in one process step. This hybridization offers the advantage of reducing the process steps of fabricating hybrid structures, leading to shorter cycle times. One way of producing hybrid components is prepreg pressing, a procedure whereby CFRPduroplastic- based prepregs are pressed into an already formed steel component; the prepreg is pressed in noncured condition. Only partial ageing of the matrix resin takes place in the heated mould. The epoxy resin also functions as an adhesive. Final curing can take place through heat at a later stage of the cathodic dip-painting at the automobile manufacturer. Thus, cycle times significantly shorter than five minutes are feasible. Prepreg pressing has been tested e. g. for idealized body structures (<b>hat</b> <b>profile</b> as a replacement structure for rocker panels or pillar segments). Essential to this were static and dynamic (crash-) requirements. Steel was used as the metallic material component; with regard to lightweight construction, the focus lay on high-strength, hot-formed steels. In order to make the prepreg pressing process more energy- and time efficient, a concept for using the residual heat of the hot-formed component has been developed. Hot-forming furnishes an ultra-high-strength steel component with high dimensional accuracy which can be taken from the tool while still warm. The approach to the production of hybrid components is making use of the residual heat that is available in any case. For this purpose, two tools with temperature regulation are used; the hot-forming process takes place in the first tool, hybridization in the second. Both tools are operated by the same press with the same cycle time, the challenge being to control temperatures so that the proportion of martensite of the steel is as high as possible and the resin is sufficiently pre-cured. JMAT Pro-simulations of the microstructure states and strength levels that occur have shown that even with the relatively long cooling times of 60 s, high strength levels can be achieved with the steel materials used. During the hybridization process, the resin is used as an adhesive, rendering an additional joining process unnecessary...|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} 3. 168 kW solid-state {{solar thermal}} simulator (SSSTS), capable of supplying ~ 30, 000 suns at a focal plane via a fibre optical delivery, has been developed. The source consists of 41 diode lasers, each operated at a wavelength {{and power of}} ~ 915 nm and ~ 80 watt, respectively. The SSSTS provides a semi-top <b>hat</b> radiation <b>profile</b> and can be focused to a diameter of ~ 10. 5 mm. The electro-optical power efficiency of the SSSTS was evaluated to be 55 %, where the maximum value of the uniform radiation flux exceeds 36. 6 MW/m 2. As such, the present technology is relevant to solar thermal applications that are not wavelength-sensitive or where narrow line-width is desirable. Additionally, the fibre optical delivery feature enables ease of direction onto a suitable target, without the need of large ellipsoidal reflectors usually employed for the conventional arc solar simulators. To demonstrate the new SSSTS, ZnO:Zn particles were introduced {{into the path of}} the radiation to investigate the change in their own temperature by using the laser induced phosphorescence technique (LIP). The temperature of the averaged particles was measured at a different radiation flux over a ~ 87 mm 2 cross sectional area. A change in the average particle temperature of up to 225 °C was detected within the measurement volume when the SSSTS was operated at a flux of ~ 30, 000 suns. The unique characteristics of the SSSTS, namely, the uniformity, high power flux, efficiency, ease of delivery, and precise control of the radiation flux responds to the current demands of solar thermal research.

40|$|CFD {{results are}} {{discussed}} for jet flows through a straight square duct, {{which is an}} interesting configuration {{in the context of}} air curtain flows for smoke and heat control in buildings in case of fire. The CFD package Fire Dynamics Simulator, Version 6. 0. 1, is used. Special focus is given to the impact of the inlet boundary condition on the flow field in the near-field region. Investigation of different orifice configurations (W = 2 cm width, variable span-wise length), including calculations inside a straight square duct (2 cm × 2 cm, with variable length) ahead of the air orifice, reveals a small vena contracta effect when the orifice is flush with a solid boundary, leading to an acceleration of the flow in the symmetry plane in the near-field region. The vena contracta effect disappears if the co-flow at the nozzle exit is aligned with the jet. More important is the effect of the duct length (precursor domain length, serving as method to generate inflow turbulent conditions for the main computation) : imposing a top <b>hat</b> velocity <b>profile,</b> a sufficiently long duct (i. e., L = 20 W) is required for the flow to become fully developed at the orifice. The CFD results confirm an analytical correlation for the ratio of the entrance length to the hydraulic diameter of the duct as function of the Reynolds number, provided the duct width is used as characteristic length scale. Using a sufficiently fine mesh, i. e., 10 cells across the characteristic dimension of the nozzle, the evolution of the mean and RMS stream-wise velocity along the centerline, as well as their profiles across the nozzle width, are shown to be captured accurately in the CFD results...|$|R

Lene Schneider-Kainer, (16 May, 1885, Vienna, Austria - 15 June, 1971, Cochabamba, Bolivia), was a Jewish-Austrian artist, daughter of the painter Sigmund Schneider. She studied art throughout Europe, and married Ludwig Kainer in 1910. Schneider-Kainer made her debut as an artist in 1917 with an exhibition at the Galerie Gurlitt, and through the 1920 s she became renowned as painter and illustrator. In 1926 Lene left Berlin after her divorce and for two years accompanied the poet Bernhard Kellermann on an extended odyssey retracing the steps of Marco Polo. She painted, photographed and sketched her impressions, and these contributions appeared regularly in the Berliner Tageblatt. Due {{to the rise of}} the Nazis she settled in Mallorca in 1932, and later Ibiza. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she left for New York. She continued to exhibit successfully around the world, and in 1954 she settled in Bolivia, where she assisted her son in establishing a textile factory. digitizedDigital imag...|$|R
