500|$|Carl proposes Homer {{be the new}} union {{president}} and he is promptly elected by a nearly unanimous vote. Mr. Burns watches Homer on his hidden camera, and is intimidated by his energy. Mr. Burns invites Homer to his office {{with the intent of}} bribing him, but Homer misconstrues Mr. Burns' sly innuendos as sexual advances. Homer quickly <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> saying he does not go for those [...] "back door shenanigans" [...] and promptly leaves, a series of events which establishes the idea in Mr. Burns' mind that Homer is honest and incorruptible.|$|E
6000|$|NICHOLLS (complacently--feeling {{his duty}} in the matter well done). That's the right spirit. I knew you'd see it that way. And you and I'll do all we can to help her. (He <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.)</b> Well, I guess I'll have to go. Tell Eileen---- ...|$|E
60|$|CHRIS--Ay tal you {{all about}} everytang--and you tal me all tangs happen to you. But not here now. Dis ain't good place for young gel, anyway. Only no good sailor fallar come here for gat drunk. [He <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> quickly and picks up her bag.] You come with me, Anna. You need lie down, gat rest.|$|E
6000|$|The Prince had <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> as pale as paper. Gotthold,’ he said, ‘you {{drive me}} beyond bounds. Beware, sir, beware!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|Witherby, {{slipping}} {{and sliding}} in his swivel chair, contrived <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> [...] "No violence, Mr. Hubbard, no violence here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The Prince had <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> as pale as paper. [...] "Gotthold," [...] he said, [...] "you {{drive me}} beyond bounds. Beware, sir, beware!" ...|$|R
60|$|BURKE--[Regaining his courage.] To the divil {{with all}} other reasons then. They don't matter with me at all. [He <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> confidently, {{assuming}} a masterful tone.] I'm thinking you're the like of them women can't make up their mind till they're drove to it. Well, then, I'll {{make up your mind}} for you bloody quick. [He takes her by the arms, grinning to soften his serious bullying.] We've had enough of talk! Let you be going into your room now and be dressing in your best and we'll be going ashore.|$|E
6000|$|... “It is simple,” {{said one}} of the peons. “Comes this señor the American, into the wine‐shop of Cananos where we are sitting. There he takes a glass of Vermouth and goes away. Then comes a man {{slipping}} by where it is darkest, and we go to warn the señor taking the caña bottle. It appears there is another man waiting in this doorway, there is a struggle, and Vincente strikes down one of the prowlers with the bottle. He <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> again, and they go in haste when they hear you coming. Then we find the señor faint and short of breath.” ...|$|E
60|$|GAYNOR. No, {{your kind}} never realises things till the crash comes--usually when it's too late. She kept on doing her work, I suppose--taking {{care of her}} {{brothers}} and sisters, washing, cooking, sweeping, looking after your comfort--worn out--when {{she should have been}} in bed--and---- (He <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> with a harsh laugh.) But what's the use of talking? The damage is done. We've got to set to work to repair it at once. I'll write to-night to Dr. Stanton of the Hill Farm Sanatorium and find out if he has a vacancy. And if luck is with us we can send her there at once. The sooner the better.|$|E
60|$|Josiah Crabtree sat up {{and then}} tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> There was a cut on his {{forehead}} from which the blood was flowing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it, but I-- I----" [...] And {{then the}} young man, having tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> {{suddenly}} collapsed and became unconscious again.|$|R
60|$|In {{two hours}} Pearson {{opened his eyes}} and took inventory. He managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and {{staggered}} back to where Road Runner was lying.|$|R
5000|$|... "Canadian Rules" [...] means that, {{instead of}} a {{traditional}} three-count, the referee must administer a five-count. Following the five-count, the competitor has to stay down for ten seconds. If both men are down for a ten-count for any reason, the first man who <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> wins the match. In addition, there are no submissions and no count-outs.|$|E
50|$|The {{theme of}} the song is the heroics of Danish sailors during the wars against Sweden in the 17th and 18th centuries. It {{specifically}} names the Danish naval heroes King Christian IV, Niels Juel and Peter Wessel Tordenskiold.The first verse refers to the Battle of Colberger Heide where King Christian IV is hurt by shrapnel and thought to be dead, but quickly <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and incites his crew to continue the battle.|$|E
5000|$|As Petrushka {{gradually}} {{pulls himself}} together, {{we hear a}} strange arpeggio in the clarinets: this is the famous [...] "Petrushka chord" [...] (consisting of juxtaposed triads of C major and F♯ major). Petrushka <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> (although shakily) {{to the accompaniment of}} waves of arpeggios from the piano (revealing the music's origins in Stravinsky's Konzertstück). The [...] "Petrushka Chord" [...] returns, now violently scored for trumpets, marked in the score [...] "Petrushka's Curses", directed at the portrait of the Magician.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, so {{you know}} him, do you?" [...] put in Link Merwell, questioningly. He had <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and was now {{straightening}} out his apparel.|$|R
6000|$|... "It wasn't {{my fault}} at all. I've a good mind to punch your face!" [...] And having <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> Koswell doubled up his fists threateningly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, then," [...] cried my uncle, <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> {{with some}} alacrity, as upon a sudden change of thought, [...] "I will get him myself." ...|$|R
50|$|The door is {{answered}} and Kamath {{and his men}} burst in, seeking help for injuries sustained in the theatre shootout. The gang of friends manages to hide the still unconscious Tony, but he wakes up and slowly <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> in a trance before collapsing. The rest of the friends try to get away, but Kamath holds Tony hostage and eventually shoots him. The gang desperately tries to retrieve their critically injured friend and escape. Tony, knowing that he is near death, asks to be taken back {{to his wife and}} daughter.|$|E
5000|$|Carl proposes Homer {{be the new}} union {{president}} and he is promptly elected by a nearly unanimous vote. Mr. Burns watches Homer on his hidden camera, and is intimidated by his energy. Mr. Burns invites Homer to his office {{with the intent of}} bribing him, but Homer misconstrues Mr. Burns' sly innuendos as sexual advances.

5000|$|Henry is {{like the}} [...] "writer-protagonists of the novels, using their speech/writing to fill the moments until death." [...] But he finds he can’t go on. He curses, <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> {{walks over to the}} water’s edge where he takes out and consults a pocket diary. With the {{exception}} of an appointment with the [...] "plumber at nine attend to the waste" [...] pipe his future is empty. The play ends with no resolution other than the certainty that the next day and the next day will be the same as the previous ones.|$|E
6000|$|... "You won't marry me?" [...] he said, <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> There was incredulity in his voice, and {{a certain}} amount of bewilderment. The thing was indeed incredible! ...|$|R
60|$|And Aaron got {{half out}} of bed. But as {{he sat on the}} bedside he knew he could not safely <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> He {{remained}} a picture of dejection.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will repeat}} the one that, to my mind, matters most." [...] Mr. Westmacott, <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> {{and in a}} loud voice, exclaimed, [...] "God save the Protestant Duke!" ...|$|R
50|$|The gang {{checks out}} the city dump {{in search of}} the demon and find Spike collecting. The demon hits Xander with light from a rod and knocks him to the ground. He <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and walks off {{with the rest of the}} gang, but then we see that there is another Xander still lying in a pile of trash. The next morning, one Xander awakens at the city dump and then discovers his double upon {{returning}} to his house. Spike has put together a Buffy doll from mannequin parts which he uses to practice beating up on.|$|E
5000|$|This {{closely resembles}} the six-tackle rule in rugby league. The team in {{possession}} has a [...] "set of six" [...] tackles before having {{to hand over}} possession. A key difference {{is that there is}} no automatic way of earning a new set of tackles in rugby league. Each set is effectively a chance to score, with failure to do so resulting in relinquishing possession. Another major difference is that play stops briefly when the player in possession of the ball is tackled and resumes once he <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and returns the ball to play.|$|E
50|$|Tom chases the bird, but Jerry {{emerges from}} his mousehole and {{intervenes}} by hitting Tom with a rake. Tom <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> {{and uses the}} rake to trap Jerry, but the woodpecker pecks the rake, sending Tom hurtling backwards into a mailbox. Tom then hurls the rake at the bird and the mouse, but the bird quickly pecks it down. Tom then chases and swallows the bird, but the bird pecks inside Tom's stomach. Tom drinks a bucket of water, but more pecking causes the water to seep out through his body. Jerry then knocks Tom's tail, allowing the woodpecker to peck out through Tom's teeth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] he answered, <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and {{speaking}} in a full voice, which, like his partner's, was that of an educated Englishman. [...] "What's the matter. Horse accident?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I was {{interrupted}} by the noise my friend made in suddenly pushing back <b>his</b> chair and <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> [...] "What's the matter?" [...] I asked. [...] "You're not ill, I hope?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was flat}} on his back, and it took several seconds for him to turn over and <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> The fall had {{attracted}} the attention of everybody making for the auto-stage excepting Spouter and Jack.|$|R
5000|$|Tom chases {{after the}} bird. The baby {{woodpecker}} calls for his [...] "mama" [...] (Jerry) Jerry emerges from his mousehole and intervenes by hitting Tom with a rake. Tom <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> {{and uses the}} rake to trap Jerry, but the woodpecker pecks the rake, sending Tom hurtling backwards into a mailbox.

50|$|An {{overwhelmed}} Jesse {{meets with}} Walter and begs him for help about cooking meth for the cartel, but lies about seeing Gus. Walter ignores Jesse's pleas and reveals {{that he put}} a GPS tracker on Jesse’s car and {{knew that he was}} in Gus's house. He begins to confront Jesse for failing to kill Gus, but a furious Jesse, feeling betrayed, throws the GPS tracker at Walter’s head. Walt furiously rushes Jesse and they engage in a brutal fight, wrecking the house Jesse finally finished restoring from damage caused by his week-long meth parties. Walter is bruised and bleeding profusely after Jesse trips him up onto a glass table. Jesse <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> and tells Walter to leave his house and never return.|$|E
50|$|Buds exerts his {{influence}} to exonerate Sam as the suspect for Hugs' murder, {{in return for}} his giving up Curtis, Daley and Mooks. Sam calls Curtis to arrange a meeting and settle this once and for all. They meet seemingly alone at an abandoned location {{to fight to the}} death. Sam overcomes Curtis and wrestles a gun from him. Instead of killing him as agreed, he empties the rounds from the clip and leaves the gun and bullets {{on the floor next to}} Curtis. Sam walks away. Wounded, Curtis <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> picks up the gun, and loads a single bullet. He walks towards Sam, but before he can shoot, armed police gun him down and Sam goes back to confront the mortally wounded Curtis. As he dies, Curtis manages to tell Sam where Daley is.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} Gabe Werner had {{rolled over and}} <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> But instead of coming at Jack again, he kept at a safe distance, in the {{meanwhile}} sucking his bruised knuckles and nursing his left ear.|$|R
60|$|GAYNOR (<b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> {{and picking}} up his overcoat). Good boy! You've {{probably}} saved me a disagreeable squabble. I won't wait for Carmody. The sight of him makes me lose my temper. Tell him I'll be back to-morrow with definite information about the sanatorium.|$|R
50|$|Down in sickbay, Galen and Cally {{recover from}} their incident. Seelix brings Nicky <b>to</b> see <b>his</b> father who painfully rests in a bed.
