50|$|According to the {{constitution}} adopted in 1992, the failure of any candidate to win more than 50 per cent of the vote meant that a second round would be required, with José Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi as sole candidates. However, Savimbi said the election had neither been free nor fair and refused {{to participate in the}} second round. Because of the Civil War, the second round never took place, and dos Santos continued as President, even without {{the constitution}}ally-necessary <b>democratic</b> <b>legitimisation.</b> Dos Santos assumed office for the third continuous term as President on 2 December 1992 and appointed Marcolino Moco as the new Prime Minister of Angola. Most of the ministries were given to MPLA, while UNITA was offered six portfolios, which was accepted only later. There were four other portfolios allocated to other parties.|$|E

40|$|The article {{analyses}} the Protocol on Social Policy and its Agreement appended to the Treaty on European Union {{and the new}} Social Chapter resp. {{not only}} in legal, but mainly in empirical perspective. The first part consists of a short summary of the basics of the new procedural rules qualified majority voting vs. unanimity, consultation and negotiations of the social partners) {{and the status of}} the corporate actors (ETUC, UNICE). In the second part, the first attempts of using the provisions of the Protocol are dealt with (European Works Councils, parental leave, burden of proof of sex discrimination, part time work). Different problems emerging in the implementation processes of the results of legal enactment and voluntary agreements are the focus of the following analysis (interpretation and application of differing legal provisions, representativity of the signatory parties, problems of package deals, <b>democratic</b> <b>legitimisation).</b> In the concluding section, the main findings are summarised (scope of ambivalent results), and a more or less pessimistic outlook on future perspectives is given.

40|$|The {{paper is}} divided into five parts. The Author {{presents}} the topics in the following order: the foreword, the introduction into the subject, {{the analysis of the}} principle of mutual recognition (taking the European Arrest Warrant and its consequences as an example, and focusing on those which are against the rule of law) and the disclosure of the deficiency of <b>democratic</b> <b>legitimisation</b> of European criminal law created by framework decisions. He also points out {{that there is a need}} to establish central European institutions in the area of criminal law enforcement and to present precise de lege ferenda postulates. This paper can be included among the critical trend of criminal law. The thesis presented in it are the outcome of the research which the author has conducted for several years. They are just a few postulates de lege ferenda and de lege lata. In order to grasp the whole spectrum o f the problem it is necessary to refer to other Prof. B. Schünemann’s publications in which the problems presented in the paper occupy a very important place...|$|E
40|$|Many {{observers}} take it {{for granted}} that the European Union suffers from a lack of democracy: in the dual sense that common policies have diverged from voters’ preferences (output legitimacy) and that decision-making mechanisms appear to lack the basic requirements of transparency, accountability and democratic involvement (input legitimacy). Stefano Micossi, Director General of Assonime, argues in this paper that once the Union is recognised for what it is – an innovative polity, where power is shared by a large number of players with many participation and influence-wielding mechanisms, – it becomes apparent that on the whole it complies with <b>democratic</b> <b>legitimisation</b> standards no less than do member states, even if multiple, and potentially conflicting legitimisation channels and principles may confuse observers. The member states and EU citizens continue to turn to the Union to seek solutions to problems that cannot be solved nationally, and there is an extraordinary proliferation of subjects and channels providing participation in European debates and decisions, in new and ever-changing ways. Through this continuous adjustment process, the Union has designed new legitimisation solutions that may well represent the future of democracy in a world of diverse but increasingly interconnected communities.

40|$|Many European {{cities are}} faced with the task of {{transforming}} former industrial zones into new residential and commercial neighbourhoods. Such urban planning processes frequently include both public and private sector actors in decision making. Furthermore, they often give way to controversial public debates about the design and uses of the urban environment as well as the planning procedures. My paper examines democratic legitimacy of decision making in urban planning processes since the 1990 s. Its aim is to contribute to the re- search on governance and democracy at the municipal level. The study consists of a qualitative comparison of two recent conversions of former industrial sites into new urban neighbourhoods in Zurich (Switzerland) and Turin (Italy). The theoretical approaches used in the study derive from fields of urban governance (e. g. Rhodes 1996, Stoker 1998) and <b>democratic</b> <b>legitimisation</b> of decision processes (Scharpf 1999, Sørensen and Torfing 2005, Skelcher 1998). The two cases of so-called public private partnerships show similarities in the decision making processes, notwithstanding different institutional contexts. The phases of planning and construction included citizen participation and deliberative instruments. However, neither the democratic legitimacy of the decision making processes nor of the actors involved was always assured. Consequently, non-classical means of civic political partici- pation (petitions, lobbying) were applied to influence planning decisions, especially where no institutional means for citizen involvement in urban planning such as local referendums were possible. The paper shows that the increase in civic participation and the problems with democratic legitimacy in governance processes are not only typical of this rather common problem in urban policy making; the two phenomena are connected to a more general change in many fields of local policy making which involves the participation of private companies as well as citizens...|$|E
40|$|Bulgaria, Albania and Romania are all {{parliamentary}} republics with {{a president}} {{as head of}} state. Although the Albanian president is elected by Parliament, he is arguably the strongest of the three, {{both in terms of}} the powers allowed by the provisional constitution and of Mr. Berisha's political practice. The constitutional reform underway in the country will however change the status quo. In Bulgaria and Romania the presidents are elected directly by popular vote, but their powers are relatively small as compared to the <b>democratic</b> <b>legitimisation</b> implied by direct elections. Actual presidential powers should however be assessed with caution as some of them are set by law or interpretations of constitutional texts, rather than by the constitutions themselves. There is also variation in {{the degree to which the}} presidents in office have exploited their constitutional powers or taken their role as non-aligned political brokers seriously. Mr. Berisha, in particular, was in control of party politics throughout his presidency and was one of the most polarising influences on public opinion. The excessive political polarisation in all three countries has however its own logic and power. Thus Mr. Zhelev invariably supported the emergence of a political centre in Bulgaria, but this did not succeed and the policy was as damaging to his political career as the fight with would-be centrists was to Berisha's. Political practice in all three countries seems to need a presidential figure. This adds flexibility to a situation governed by hostile and mutually suspicious parties, stuck parliaments and weak or inexperienced governments. The presidents also command considerable influence on public opinion. Public opinion in Bulgaria, for example, largely supports the idea of greater power for the president, in contrast with the opinions of constitutionalists and other law-makers in the country. Under the legacy of the past, the people have a love-hate relationship with such paternalist figures. Presidents personalise politics in the public mind, but they can also become scapegoats for political failures...|$|E
40|$|The most {{straightforward}} European single {{energy market}} design would entail a European system operator regulated {{by a single}} European regulator. This would ensure the predictable development of rules for the entire EU, significantly reducing regulatory uncertainty for electricity sector investments. But such a first-best market design {{is unlikely to be}} politically realistic in the European context for three reasons. First, the necessary changes compared to the current situation are substantial and would produce significant redistributive effects. Second, a European solution would deprive member states of the ability to manage their energy systems nationally. And third, a single European solution might fall short of being well-tailored to consumers’ preferences, which differ substantially across the EU. To nevertheless reap significant benefits from an integrated European electricity market, we propose the following blueprint: First, we suggest adding a European system-management layer to complement national operation centres and help them to better exchange information about the status of the system, expected changes and planned modifications. The ultimate aim should be to transfer the day-to-day responsibility for the safe and economic operation of the system to the European control centre. To further increase efficiency, electricity prices should be allowed to differ between all network points between and within countries. This would enable throughput of electricity through national and international lines to be safely increased without any major investments in infrastructure. Second, to ensure the consistency of national network plans and to ensure that they contribute to providing the infrastructure for a functioning single market, the role of the European ten year network development plan (TYNDP) needs to be upgraded by obliging national regulators to only approve projects planned at European level unless they can prove that deviations are beneficial. This boosted role of the TYNDP would need to be underpinned by resolving the issues of conflicting interests and information asymmetry. Therefore, the network planning process should be opened to all affected stakeholders (generators, network owners and operators, consumers, residents and others) and enable the European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) to act as a welfare-maximising referee. An ultimate political decision by the European Parliament on the entire plan will open a negotiation process around selecting alternatives and agreeing compensation. This ensures that all stakeholders have an interest in guaranteeing a certain degree of balance of interest in the earlier stages. In fact, transparent planning, early stakeholder involvement and <b>democratic</b> <b>legitimisation</b> are well suited for minimising as much as possible local opposition to new lines. Third, sharing the cost of network investments in Europe is a critical issue. One reason is that so far even the most sophisticated models have been unable to identify the individual long-term net benefit in an uncertain environment. A workable compromise to finance new network investments would consist of three components: (i) all easily attributable cost should be levied on the responsible party; (ii) all network users that sit at nodes that are expected to receive more imports through a line extension should be obliged to pay a share of the line extension cost through their network charges; (iii) the rest of the cost is socialised to all consumers. Such a cost-distribution scheme will involve some intra-European redistribution from the well-developed countries (infrastructure-wise) to those that are catching up. However, such a scheme would perform this redistribution in a much more efficient way than the Connecting Europe Facility’s ad-hoc disbursements to politically chosen projects, because it would provide the infrastructure that is really needed...|$|E
