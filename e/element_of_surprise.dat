5|$|Following {{extensive}} {{discussions on}} the fighting ability of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, the Political Bureau approved the General Staff’s plan, which had selected the Central Highlands as the main battlefield for the upcoming offensive. The Central Highlands campaign was codenamed ‘Campaign 275’ and {{the goal was to}} capture the city of Ban Me Thuot. To achieve that objective, North Vietnamese General Văn Tiến Dũng placed great emphasis on the principles of massed force, secrecy, and surprise to draw South Vietnamese forces away from the main objective. For the <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> to be successful, North Vietnamese forces needed to launch strong diversionary attacks on Pleiku and Kon Tum, thereby leaving Ban Me Thuot completely exposed. Once the <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> had been achieved, the North Vietnamese would mass their forces on Ban Me Thuot, and prevent South Vietnamese reinforcements from retaking the city.|$|E
5|$|Positioning the Second and Third Armies {{with their}} {{bridging}} equipment along the canal {{in preparation for}} Operation Badr would put the Israelis on high alert. Without the <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> Egyptian forces would suffer high losses in the attack (estimates for casualties already ran in the thousands). The Directorate of Military Intelligence (abbreviated Aman), which formulated Israel's intelligence estimate and was known for its competency, was tasked with detecting troop movements and activity along Egyptian and Syrian forces; military activity which would be particularly intensive {{in the last days}} preceding the assault.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} was discovered at about 00:30 on June 3, and Zur's force lost the <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise.</b> The Egyptian position that engaged the Israelis had two companies, but Harpaz, the 51st's 3rd Company's commander, underestimated {{the force and}} reported that it contained only one platoon. Zur decided to regroup in the wadi and ordered Aryeh Kotzer's 1st Company to stay and engage the Egyptians {{at the spot where}} they were originally discovered and assault the pillbox there, {{while the rest of the}} forces would try a turning movement.|$|E

5|$|Against {{the advice}} of Captain Dove, Paxton {{continued}} to advance the regiment. The <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> was gone, and it was dark. Dove knew the probability of being attacked was high, and he took steps to minimize the danger to the main column. The advance guard was ambushed around 1:00 am on May 2. Dove received a severe wound on his foot, {{and two of his}} men were killed. The regiment's total losses were four killed, eight wounded, and four missing—plus 28 horses killed. Paxton, who was popular with the regiment, was dismissed by General Eliakim P. Scammon after the regiment returned to camp.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines (1/7) {{also tried to}} break the Chinese {{blockade}} at Hill 1419 on 1 December. Despite being badly reduced by combat, hunger and frostbite, the PVA 59th Division sent in its last five platoons and refused to yield. As night approached, 1/7 finally captured the peak and started to march through the hills {{on the east side}} of the road. Relying on the <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise,</b> they managed to destroy several Chinese positions along the road. On the morning of 2 December, a joint attack by Fox Company and 1/7 secured the Toktong Pass, thus opening the road between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri.|$|E
5|$|Hackett {{decided the}} brigade would advance between the railway {{line and the}} Ede–Arnhem road, in order to capture their three objectives, first the high ground {{overlooking}} Johanna Hoeve farm, next the woods near to Lichtenbeek House and finally the high ground at Koepel. The delay in England meant it was 17:00 before the brigade started moving. With the <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> gone and no intelligence on the German dispositions, 156 Para headed for the first objective. Followed by 10 Para slightly behind and to their left. Bringing up the rear was the brigade reserve 4th Field Squadron, Royal Engineers, acting in an infantry role.|$|E

5|$|Kagame {{returned}} to Africa and took {{command of the}} RPF forces, which {{had been reduced to}} fewer than 2,000 troops. Kagame and his soldiers moved west, through Uganda, to the Virunga Mountains, a rugged high-altitude area where the terrain worked in their favor. From there he re-armed and reorganized the army, and carried out fundraising and recruitment from the Tutsi diaspora. Kagame restarted combat in January 1991, with an attack on the northern town of Ruhengeri. Benefiting from the <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise,</b> the RPF captured the town and held it for a day before retreating back into the forests.|$|E
5|$|Primarily {{the brainchild}} of General Nguyen Chi Thanh, the {{upcoming}} offensive would be timed to provoke a popular general uprising among the South Vietnamese people against the government and its American supporters. Yet prudence required that the South Vietnamese maintain 50 per cent of their forces on standby, while American and allied forces under General William Westmoreland—the Free World Military Forces—remained on full alert. However, despite such measures the fighting at Khe Sanh had largely succeeded in diverting American resources and attention away from Saigon and towards the demilitarized zone, affording the communists the <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Tripolitan vessel, Tripoli, and Enterprise {{were quite}} evenly matched. Enterprise, with a {{complement}} of 90, was a 12-gun, 135-ton schooner built in 1799 that had seen {{action in the}} Quasi-War. In contrast, Tripoli, a lateen-rigged polacca with two masts, was crewed by 80men under Admiral Rais Mahomet Rous and armed with 14guns. Although the Tripolitans held a slight advantage in firepower, Enterprise had to its advantage the larger crew and the <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise.</b> The Americans were also significantly more experienced in gunnery action than the Tripolitans, who preferred to attack by boarding and taking over their opponents' ships.|$|E
5000|$|During the Second World War, the Axis powers {{employed}} joint or combined {{operations to}} launch invasions in Europe and Asia.

5|$|When {{the weather}} was right, the force would cross the English Channel in {{darkness}} and attack shortly after midnight {{to coincide with the}} Zeebrugge Raid a few miles up the coast. By co-ordinating their operations, the assault forces would stretch the German defenders and hopefully gain the <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise.</b> Covering the Inshore Squadron would be heavy bombardment from an offshore squadron of monitors and destroyers as well as artillery support from Royal Marine artillery near Ypres in Allied-held Flanders. Closer support would be offered by several flotillas of motor launches, small torpedo boats and Coastal Motor Boats which would lay smoke screens to obscure the advancing blockships as well as evacuate the crews of the cruisers after they had blocked the channel.|$|E
5|$|After {{three months}} of {{inactivity}} and regrouping, Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to begin fighting again. The target chosen for the first attack was {{the northern city of}} Ruhengeri, which lies immediately south of the Virunga mountains. The city was the best choice from a practical point of view, being the only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while maintaining an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise.</b> Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, as well as his wife and her powerful family, came from the north west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region was as the heartland of the regime. An attack there guaranteed that the population would become aware of the RPF's presence, and Kagame hoped the attack would destabilise the government.|$|E
5|$|Although Bagramyan {{found it}} {{acceptable}} to sustain heavy casualties (as {{did all the}} commanders of the Red Army), he was disturbed with the immense loss of life his forces were sustaining. He, however, attempted to reduce those levels primarily by maintaining the <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> in operations. In his preparations for Bagration, he planned for the 43rd Army {{to move through the}} more geographically difficult swamps and marshlands to Army Group North's right flank. This maneuver would thus take North by surprise since it expected the Soviet offensive to move through more suitable terrain. He proved correct, as in early June 1944, the 43rd achieved success in its attack. Commander of the 43rd Army, General Afanasy Beloborodov, wrote that during the offensive they apprehended a German general who stated that German forces had been blindsided by the attacking forces.|$|E

Some survivors of sea battles were often pressed into guarding the ships during land skirmishes.|$|R

5|$|General McDowell then ordered Shelby and Clarke to take Musgrove's Mill, a British encampment on the Enoree River. They rode {{all night}} with two hundred men, {{reaching}} their location about dawn on August 18, 1780. The colonists had estimated the enemy force was of comparable size, but an advance scout brought word there were approximately 500 British soldiers in the camp who were preparing for battle. Shelby's men and horses were too tired for a retreat and they had lost the <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise.</b> He ordered his men to construct a breastwork from nearby logs and brush. In half an hour the makeshift fortifications were complete, and twenty-five colonial riders charged the British camp to provoke the attack. The British pursued {{them back to the}} main colonial force. Despite being outnumbered, the colonists killed several British officers and put their army to flight.|$|E
5|$|Rawlinson had {{submitted}} Monash's {{proposals to}} Haig in July and Haig had forwarded them to Foch. At {{a meeting on}} 24 July, Foch agreed to the plan but insisted that the French First Army, which held the front {{to the south of}} the British Fourth Army, should participate. Rawlinson opposed this as his and Monash's plans depended on the large-scale use of tanks (now finally available in large numbers) to achieve surprise, by avoiding a preliminary bombardment. The French First Army lacked tanks and would be forced to bombard the German positions before the infantry advance began, thus removing the <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise.</b> Eventually, it was agreed that the French would participate, but not launch their attack until 45 minutes after the Fourth Army. It was also agreed to advance the proposed date of the attack from 10 August to 8 August, to strike the Germans before they had completed their withdrawal from the Marne salient.|$|E
5|$|The German Army halted its offensives in July. The King's 11th Battalion disbanded in April, {{followed}} in May by the temporary {{consolidation of the}} Liverpool Pals as the 17th (Composite) Battalion. Their brief unity ended in May when they reduced to form training cadres for the U.S. 137th Regiment. In August, after four months {{of being on the}} defensive, the Allies launched an offensive against Amiens, in the Somme area. Meticulous preparation gave them the <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> when it began on the 8th. More than 16,000 prisoners were taken within two hours and the German frontline mostly collapsed. In the following Battle of Albert, begun on the 21st, the 13th King's suffered 274 casualties, but captured 150 soldiers and many machine-guns, while the 1st assisted in the taking of Ervillers.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to test if {{performance}} of airline pilots, in performing an aerodynamic stall recovery procedure, decreases when they are surprised, compared to when they anticipate a stall event. Background: New flight-safety regulations for commercial aviation recommend the introduction <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> and startle in upset prevention and recovery training. This calls for more evidence on the effects <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> on pilot performance, as well as methods to effectively induce surprise in training simulators. Method: The study took place in a motion-base simulator with a poststall aerodynamic model. Using a within-subjects design, the recovery performance of 20 pilots was tested in 2 conditions: 1 anticipated condition, and 1 surprise condition. In addition to flight parameters, subjective and physiological data relating to surprise and startle were measured. Results: Pilots had significantly more difficulties with adhering to the recovery procedure in the surprise condition compared to the anticipation condition. The subjective and physiological measures confirmed that the manipulation mainly increased surprise, and to a lesser extent also startle. Conclusion: The results suggest that pilots have more difficulty in managing an upset situation (i. e., an aerodynamic stall) when this situation is presented unexpectedly, underlining that upset prevention and recovery training should include <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise.</b> Control & SimulationControl & Operation...|$|R

5|$|The {{second and}} last mission—Operation Fustian—began at 19:30 on 12July, {{when the first}} {{aircraft}} carrying the 1st Parachute Brigade took off from North Africa. Following behind the parachute force were the glider-towing aircraft, comprising twelve Albemarles and seven Halifaxes, towing eleven Horsa and eight Waco gliders. The first glider casualties occurred on takeoff, when two aircraft towing Waco gliders crashed. While en route, one glider was released prematurely by its towing aircraft and crashed into the sea. Arriving over Sicily, having lost the <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise,</b> four gliders were shot down by coastal anti-aircraft batteries. By the time the gliders arrived at their landing zones, two hours had lapsed {{since the start of}} the parachute landings. With the German defences alerted, only four Horsa gliders managed to land mostly intact, all the others being caught by German machine-gun fire and destroyed on their approach.

5|$|When {{the guns}} at Fort Nassau were {{heard by the}} attackers, they {{realized}} the <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> was lost and aborted the assault. The elements of the fleet then rejoined in Hanover Sound, about six nautical miles east of Nassau. There Hopkins held council, and a new plan of attack was developed. According to accounts now discredited, Hopkins' lieutenant, John Paul Jones, suggested a new landing point and then led the action. Jones was unfamiliar with the local waters, unlike many of the captains present in the council. It {{is more likely that}} the landing force was led by Cabot lieutenant, Thomas Weaver, who was also familiar with the area. With the force enlarged by 50 sailors, the three ships, with the Wasp offering additional covering support, carried it to a point south and east of Fort Montagu, where they made an unopposed landing between 12:00 and 2:00 pm. This was the first landing of what eventually became the United States Marine Corps.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on {{the second}} day, the {{defenders}} on the bridge saw a small convoy of trucks approaching at some speed from the south, which at first they misidentified as the British XXX Corps.

Soon afterwards, German infantry and armour approached the bridge from the east. One tank reached the space under the bridge before it was destroyed by one of the 6pounder anti-tank guns. At 09:00, thirty armoured cars, half-tracks and trucks from the 9th SS Panzer Division attempted to rush the bridge from the south. The first five armoured cars, using the wrecks of the dawn convoy as cover and with the <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>surprise,</b> managed to cross unscathed. The rest of the force was engaged and twelve of their vehicles destroyed with the survivors returning to the southern bank.
