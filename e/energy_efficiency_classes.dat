40|$|In {{order to}} fulfil the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) {{requirements}} for the reduction of energy consumption, European national requirements have been created for building envelope thermal properties and calculation methodology to determine if building energy efficiency is created. This is however not true in all methodologies. The necessity of building air tightness appears only for new A class buildings, {{and there are no}} requirements for air tightness for other building classes. Therefore, the aim of this work is to improve the methodology for the calculation of energy efficiency of buildings, while taking into account the air tightness of the buildings. In order to achieve this aim, the sum energy consumption of investigated buildings was calculated, <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>classes</b> were determined, air tightness of the buildings was measured, and reasons for insufficient air tightness were analyzed. Investigation results show that the average value of air tightness of A energy efficiency class buildings is 0. 6 h− 1. The results of other investigated buildings, corresponding to B and C <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>classes,</b> show insufficient air tightness (the average n 50 value is 6 h− 1); herewith, energy consumption for heating is higher than calculated, according to the energy efficiency methodology.

40|$|AbstractUnfortunately, a {{complete}} integration of energy efficiency aspects into industrial design practice of Energy-related Products (ErPs) {{has not yet}} been achieved. This is in part {{due to a lack of}} solutions (approaches, methods and IT tools) that support designers with rapid assessment of design options and checking their compliance with energy-related regulatory constraints. Particularly important for ErPs are limit-value constraints, which are defined by regulatory elements (laws, norms, labels, company-internal regulations, etc.) that directly specify measurable values and/or limits e. g. <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>classes.</b> The goal of this paper is to introduce a method that assists designers in rapidly and roughly performing energy assessments of mass-produced ErP design options and verifying their compliance with energy-related limit-value constraints. The introduced method is the result of the integration of a self-developed approach for compliance checking into a previously developed methodical approach for rough energy assessment. The introduced method has been validated by a case study of two washing machine design options. The long-term goal is to develop method-specific IT support.

40|$|In a seismic territory, {{one of the}} {{concerns}} of the public administrators is to guarantee people safety in case of earthquake, mainly in public facilities and in particular in school buildings. Public administrations are facing a complex problem and they need to know the level of risk and the criticalities, together with the required countermeasures and their costs, in order to define a rational and effective strategy for the mitigation of seismic risk, and consequently better allocate the resources (money and time). This problem was addressed in the ASSESS (Analysis of the Seismic ScEnarios of the School buildings for a definition of retrofitting priorities for Seismic risk reduction) project, aimed at knowing for preventive purposes the seismic risk of about 1000 school buildings of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region (north-eastern Italy). During the project, the evaluation of people safety was approached with holistic and interdisciplinary methodologies, and with multi-level studies (Figure 1). In particular, geological and geophysical studies together with vulnerability evaluations were carried out in correspondence of the school buildings. For each school a geological-technical map was developed, on which the geomorphological and hydrogeological features are represented, as these aspects can be considered potential seismic amplifiers. Furthermore, geophysical investigations were carried out in order to assess the velocity profiles to be used for evaluating the local amplification, through 1 D modelling. The vulnerability assessment was done in a different way based on the level of investigation: the first level was based on a statistical approach, while a specific methodology, named VISUS, has been applied in the second level: the method, developed during the project, is based on rapid visual screening that permits the identification of weakness or critical effects in the seismic behaviour. Moreover, the vulnerability related to non-structural elements and of the egress system is provided. The ASSESS project implied the definition of decision-making supports in the form of synthesis indicators (Figure 2). In particular, a performance structural class was assigned to each school building, based on the ratio between the capacity and the demand of the structure. The membership to each class is defined, graphically, in analogy to the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>classes.</b> Furthermore, globally considering safety, five main issues have been identified in order to take into account all the elements that can cause deaths or injuries: site, global structural, local structural, non-structural, and functional weaknesses. The results are synthesized within an “intervention requirement rose”, where the presence of one or more “petals” implies the presence of potential criticalities, while a rose without “petals” implies that the goal of “people safety” has been reached. The data in the “intervention requirement rose” are again synthesized in a single indicator: the “ASSESS safety star”, that provides a global seismic judgment of the school. Finally, it is important to remark that the decision-making support tools defined for public administrators permit to better address the resources for a more effective definition of a strategy aimed at seismic risk mitigation at a territorial scale...|$|E

Thus, the electric power consumption of the modules and the refrigerator decrease by 95 % and 20 % respectively, with respect to those attained with a cascade refrigeration system connected with the cooler compartment. The optimization process is based on a computational model that simulates the behaviour of the whole refrigerator. Two prototypes have been built and tested.

In order to meet high requirements of "A" <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>class</b> buildings should be used new energy efficient structural and insulating solutions should be made. In order to evaluate overall heat losses in these joints more exactly it is required to calculate values of heat transmission coefficients of linear thermal bridges in "A" energy class buildings. The project of semi-detached building was chosen in order to analyse influence of linear thermal bridges for building's energy consumption as {{there are all kinds of}} linear thermal bridges which values must be calculated. Buildings <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> designing program, which based on EN ISO 13790, was used to calculate building's heat losses. Heat transmission coefficients of linear thermal bridges were calculated using program THERM. Two variations were analysed: building's energy consumptions are close to the lowest point of A class requirements when building's envelopes and joints of units in joint places are the same as they are in currently built houses; and effective energy solutions of building's joints. The results of analysis showed that requirements of "A" class can be reached using ordinary solutions for building's envelopes and joint units but if linear thermal bridges are designed like that, it makes 16 % heat losses through envelopes, and it is similar to heat losses through building's walls (17 %), furthermore, it is about 1. 5 times bigger than heat losses through roof (10 %) or floors (10 %). Specific heat losses of thermal bridges make 7. 80 kWh/m² per year. The biggest overall heat losses are through walls and windows joint thermal bridges (specific heat losses make 13. 55 W/K). Another significant part of heat losses comes from walls and floor joints (specific heat losses make 11. 88 W/K). After solutions of buildings with energy effective building's envelopes and units joints were analysed it can be stated that overall heat losses decreased about 10 kWh/m² per year, it is 20 %. Heat losses through thermal bridges make only 3 % of overall heat losses through envelopes, it is 122 kWh/m² per year. According to results of the analyse general specifications were made for designing building envelopes of "A" energy efficient class:- The building of "A" class can be designed using ordinary solutions of linear thermal bridges, bigger heat losses through thermal bridges can be covered by increasing thickness of thermal insulating layers and using windows of better thermal behaviour but as a result the costs of building house increase too. - When effective solutions of linear thermal bridges are used, the same <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the building can be reached using less thermal insulating layers, windows and doors of less thermal behaviour if the building of better energy characteristics is designed...|$|R
