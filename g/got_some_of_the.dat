2500|$|Kyle MacLachlan says Dylan McDermott was {{the first}} choice for the {{character}} of Zack Carey, but he declined and MacLachlan was then cast. The actor later recalled, [...] "That was a decision {{that was sort of}} a tough one to make, but I was enchanted with Paul Verhoeven. Particularly Robocop, which I loved. I look back on it now and it’s a little dated, but it’s still fantastic, and I think it’s <b>got</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great villains of all time in there. It was Verhoeven and [...] Eszterhas, and it seemed like {{it was going to be}} kind of dark and edgy and disturbing and real." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Daily News and The Globe both {{noted that}} Act I ran {{longer than any}} {{previous}} Savoy Opera and needed pruning. The Manchester Guardian praised the work, but commented that there was [...] "much (sometimes too much) Gilbertian dialogue". However, Gilbert and Sullivan's choices for what to cut are suspect. [...] The soprano's aria, [...] "Youth is a boon avowed" [...] <b>got</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most enthusiastic reviews from the press but was cut after the opening night. [...] The Globe called it [...] "one of Sir Arthur Sullivan's best works". [...] Also, the pre-production cuts left subplots that were introduced in Act I unresolved. [...] For example, Sullivan refused to set one of Gilbert's scenes for Nancy McIntosh, which left the Scaphio–Phantis–Zara subplot unresolved. [...] Rutland Barrington, in his memoirs, felt that the [...] "second act... was not as full of fun as usual" [...] in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.|$|E

50|$|ISO-8859-14 was {{originally}} {{proposed for the}} Sami languages. ISO 8859-12 was proposed for Celtic. Later, ISO 8859-12 was proposed for Devanagari, so the Celtic proposal was changed to ISO 8859-14. The Sami proposal was changed to ISO 8859-15, but it <b>got</b> rejected. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> code points were originally different.|$|R
