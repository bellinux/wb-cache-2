40|$|Abstract: Accurate {{modeling}} of urban wind flow {{is important for}} the assessment of the natural ventilation of the outdoor environment and therefore for outdoor air quality. Different geometrical levels of analysis can be used, ranging from regular arrays of obstacles to real and complex case studies. In order to avoid the complexity of real case studies and to obtain more generic results, regular arrays of obstacles represent a suitable level to study the relation between urban morphology and outdoor ventilation. This paper presents the first results of a numerical study with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) of isothermal wind flow in generic urban configurations. Nine urban configurations are defined with regular arrays of obstacles by increasing the plan area density (from 0. 1 to 0. 6) and the frontal area density (from 0. 02 to 0. 45). By this variation, the flow structure varies from <b>isolated</b> <b>obstacle</b> flow over wake interference flow to skimming flow.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the numerical {{solution of the}} scattering of time-harmonic plane waves from an infinite periodic array of reflection or transmission obstacles in a homogeneous background medium, in two dimensions. Boundary integral formulations are ideal since they reduce the problem to N unknowns on the obstacle boundary. However, for complex geometries and/or higher frequencies the resulting dense linear system becomes large, ruling out dense direct methods, and often ill-conditioned (despite being 2 nd-kind), rendering fast multipole-based iterative schemes also inefficient. We present an integral equation based solver with O(N) complexity, which handles such ill-conditioning, using recent advances in “fast ” direct linear algebra to invert hierarchically the <b>isolated</b> <b>obstacle</b> matrix. This is combined with a recent periodizing scheme that is robust for all incident angles, including Wood’s anomalies, based upon the free space Green’s function kernel. The resulting solver is extremely efficient when multiple incident angles are needed, as occurs in many applications. Our numerical tests include a complicated obstacle several wavelengths in size, with N = 10 5 and solution error of 10 − 10, where the solver is 66 times faster per incident angle than a fast multipole based iterative solution, and 600 times faster when incident angles are chosen to share Bloch phases. 1...|$|E

The research {{was achieved by}} a systematic flume study {{based on the results}} of dimensional analysis of local scour. The main tested obstacles for local scour were cubes. Local scour at a circular cylinder of aspect ratio 1 and a sphere were also examined for comparison with scour at cubes. Each obstacle was placed on a flat movable bed and oriented normal to the incident flow. Non-cohesive uniform medium sand and very fine gravel were used as movable beds. The tested flow conditions were controlled to give many combinations of the relevant dimensionless parameters for local scour: the flow Froude Number, relative obstacle size, and relative roughness of bed material. Water surface profiles and longitudinal velocity profiles along the plane of symmetry, as well as the horizontal velocities near the bed around <b>isolated</b> <b>obstacles</b> on a fixed bed were examined in several runs. For a slightly submerged cube, the path of maximum velocity downstream of the cube moves from the water surface into the lower part of the flow. At a greater distance downstream, the path of maximum velocity tends to move upward toward the water surface. An increase of flow Froude Number leads to a hydraulic jump behind the cube. The relative longitudinal velocity near the bed is increased in this region. The decrease of relative water depth or the increase of flow Froude Number can lead to increased average relative horizontal velocity (V/u) near a cube. The cube has the highest average V/u value, as compared to flow near a circular cylinder and a sphere. The local scour processes and equilibrium scour patterns at isolated cubes on movable beds were also examined. There is not a unique equilibrium scour pattern for clear-water scour at a cube on a movable bed. Equations were developed to predict the maximum equilibrium scour depth and scour volume and the critical condition for incipient motion of bed material at a cube in clear-water scour. As the water becomes relatively deep, the shape effect of the circular cylinder and the sphere become negligible. The major equilibrium movement of a cube on a movable bed due to scour involves longitudinal displacement, vertical settlement, and longitudinal inclination. Equations were developed to predict the equilibrium movement and the critical condition for incipient upstream movement of a cube in clear-water scour...|$|R
40|$|The {{representation}} of geometries as buildings, flood barriers or dikes in free surface flow models implies tedious and time-consuming operations {{in order to}} define accurately the shape of these objects when using a body fitted numerical mesh. The immersed boundary method is an alternative way to define solid bodies inside the computational domain without the need of fitting the mesh boundaries {{to the shape of}} the object.

Moving least-squares is used to transmit information between the grid of Lagrangian markers and the fluid Eulerian mesh. The performance of the proposed implementation is analysed in three test cases involving different flow conditions: the flow around a spur dike, a dam break flow with an <b>isolated</b> <b>obstacle</b> and the flow around an array of obstacles. A very good agreement between the classic body fitted approach and the immersed boundary method was found.

40|$|Obstacle {{detection}} (OD) {{is one of}} {{the main}} components of the control system of autonomous vehicles. In the case of indoor/urban navigation, obstacles are typically defined as surface points that are higher than the ground plane. This characterisation, however, cannot be used in cross-country and unstructured environments, where the notion of "ground plane" is often not meaningful. A previous OD technique for cross-country navigation (adopted by the DEMO III experimental unmanned vehicle) computes obstacle by analysing the columns of a range image independently, looking for steps or slopes along the range profile. This procedure, however, is prone to missing obstacles with surface normal pointing away from the line of sight. We introduce a fast, fully 3 -D OD technique that overcomes such a problem, reducing the risk of false-negatives while keeping the same rate of false-positives. A simple addition to our algorithm allows one to segment obstacle points into clusters, where each cluster identifies an <b>isolated</b> <b>obstacle</b> in 3 -D space. Obstacle segmentation corresponds to finding the connected components of a suitable graph, an operation that can be performed at a minimal additional cost during the computation of obstacle points. Rule-based classification using 3 -D geometrical measures derived for each segmented obstacle is then used to reject false-obstacles (for example, objects that are small in volume, or of low height).

The experiments were designed to systematically study the influence of double obstacles on stably stratified flow. The experimental set-up consists of a two-layer flow in the water tank, with a lower neutral and an upper stable layer separated by a sharp density discontinuity. This type of layering over terrain is known to be conducive to a variety of possible responses in the atmosphere, from hydraulic jumps to lee waves and highly turbulent rotors. In each experiment, obstacles were towed through the tank at a constant speed. The towing speed {{and the size of the}} tank allowed high Reynolds-number flow similar to the atmosphere. Here, we present the experimental design, together with {{an overview of}} laboratory experiments conducted and their results. We develop a regime diagram for flow over single and double obstacles and examine the parameter space where the secondary obstacle has the largest influence on the flow. Trapped lee waves, rotors, hydraulic jumps, lee-wave interference and flushing of the valley atmosphere are successfully reproduced in the stratified water tank. Obstacle height and ridge separation distance are shown to control lee-wave interference. Results, however, differ partially from previous findings on the flow over double ridges reported in the literature due to the presence of nonlinearities and possible differences in the boundary layer structure. The secondary obstacle also influences the transition between different flow regimes and makes trapped lee waves possible for higher Froude numbers than expected for an <b>isolated</b> <b>obstacle...</b>|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from Public Library of Science via the DOI in this record. As populations spread into new territory, {{environmental}} heterogeneities can shape the population front and genetic composition. We focus here on the effects of an important building block of heterogeneous environments, isolated obstacles. With a combination of experiments, theory, and simulation, we show how isolated obstacles both create long-lived distortions of the front shape and amplify the effect of genetic drift. A system of bacteriophage T 7 spreading on a spatially heterogeneous Escherichia coli lawn serves as an experimental model system to study population expansions. Using an inkjet printer, we create well-defined replicates of the lawn and quantitatively study the population expansion of phage T 7. The transient perturbations of the population front found in the experiments are well described by a model in which the front moves with constant speed. Independent of the precise details of the expansion, we show that obstacles create a kink in the front that persists over large distances and is insensitive to the details of the obstacle’s shape. The small deviations between experimental findings and the predictions of the constant speed model can be understood with a more general reaction-diffusion model, which reduces to the constant speed model when the obstacle size is large compared to the front width. Using this framework, we demonstrate that frontier genotypes just grazing the side of an <b>isolated</b> <b>obstacle</b> increase in abundance, a phenomenon we call ‘geometry-enhanced genetic drift’, complementary to the founder effect associated with spatial bottlenecks. Bacterial range expansions around nutrient-poor barriers and stochastic simulations confirm this prediction. The effect of the obstacle on the genealogy of individuals at the front is characterized by simulations and rationalized using the constant speed model. Lastly, we consider the effect of two obstacles on front shape and genetic composition of the population illuminating the effects expected from complex environments with many obstacles.

Both versions include GESTALT (Grid-based Estimation of Surface Traversability Applied to Local Terrain), a navigation program that generates local-terrain models from stereoscopic image pairs captured by onboard rover cameras; uses this information to evaluate candidate arcs that extend across the terrain from the current rover location; ranks the arcs with respect to hazard avoidance, minimization of steering time, and the direction towards the goal; and combines the rankings in a weighted vote to select an arc, along which the rover is then driven. GESTALT works well in navigating around small <b>isolated</b> <b>obstacles,</b> but tends to fail when the goal {{is on the other}} side of a large obstacle or multiple closely spaced small obstacles. When that occurs, the goal seeking votes and hazard avoidance votes conflict severely. The hazard avoidance votes will not allow the rover to drive through the unsafe area, and the waypoint votes will not allow enough deviation from the straight-line path for the rover to get around the hazard. The rover becomes stuck and is unable to reach the goal. The {{revised version of}} AutoNav utilizes a global path-planning program, Field D*, to evaluate the cost of traveling from the end of each GESTALT arc to the goal. In the voting process, Field D* arc votes supplant GESTALT goal-seeking arc votes. Hazard avoidance, steering bias, and Field D* votes are merged and the rover is driven a preset distance along the arc with the highest vote. Then new images are acquired and the process as described is repeated until the goal is reached. This new technology allows the rovers to autonomously navigate around much more complex obstacle arrangements than was previously possible. In addition, this improved autonomy enables longer traverses per Sol (a day on Mars), and can make planning drives easier for operators on Earth...|$|R
