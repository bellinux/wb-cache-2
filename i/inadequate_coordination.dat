40|$|The {{adoption}} of strategic planning {{in the public}} sector has become common place. However, its adoption by the Zambian public sector has never been subjected to critical evaluation. The aim of this research was to investigate {{the nature and extent of}} {{adoption of}} strategic planning processes in the Zambian public sector. This research used a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods and was based on a multiple case study approach. The qualitative research used semi-structure interviews and documentary review on thirteen government ministries with the resulting data being analysed using content analysis. The quantitative research used a self-completion questionnaire on sixteen government ministries. The findings suggest an increase in the comprehensiveness and inclusiveness of strategic planning processes of the Zambian public sector. However, challenges were evident in a number of areas including; integration of organisational processes, harmonisation of strategic planning processes, completeness of the process, use of strategy tools and participation of operational staff and external stakeholders. Barriers established included; financial and human resource challenges, inadequate process alignment, inadequate enforcement mechanisms, inappropriate work culture, political interference, <b>inadequate</b> inter-ministerial <b>coordination,</b> <b>inadequate</b> communication of strategic plans and inadequate strategic planning knowledge among staff. The findings of this research provide an important contribution by adding the Zambian perspective to the strategic management literature which, at the time of the study, had not been documented and subjected to critical review. A further important contribution is in the provision of a set of practical guidelines to assist public managers in optimising their use of strategic planning...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To compare vocal function, school performance, {{and vocal}} {{discomfort}} between sheltered and nonsheltered school children in Aracaju, Brazil. Methods. A controlled cross-sectional study {{was carried out}} on 7 - to 10 -year-old children who attended school regularly. Two groups of children were studied: the study group (SG), with children {{who lived in a}} shelter, and the control group (CG) containing children who lived with their families. We interviewed 44 children for the SG and 15 (34 %) revealed vocal discomfort (SG = 15). Concomitantly, we interviewed 400 regular school children from the same geographical area and 45 (11. 25 %) were selected for the control group (CG). They were paired by sex and age with the sheltered children using a 3 : 1 ratio. Both groups were interviewed about school performance and vocal discomfort and were evaluated using perceptual and acoustic measurements for the voice and larynx. Results. Children from both groups had started public school late. There were more individuals with vocal discomfort in the SG and individuals in this group also had a slower speech rate and <b>inadequate</b> pneumophonic <b>coordination</b> compared with the CG. the Dysphonia Severity Index (DSI) revealed mild-moderate deviation for both groups. Upper harmonics and palatal tonsil hypertrophy were higher in the CG, whereas laryngeal constriction was more common in the SG. Conclusion. All the SG children revealed mild-moderate deviance on the DSI, a higher level of vocal discomfort, a slow speech rate, <b>inadequate</b> pneumophonic <b>coordination,</b> and laryngeal constriction. the results here presented suggest that social conditions are important for voice behavior in children.

This paper will discuss the 10 / 90 gap and apply it to case studies from Mongolia and Mozambique to illustrate the general public health research situation in developing countries and the effects of <b>inadequate</b> research <b>coordination.</b> The major problem for Mongolia is that there is no efficient network for research coordination. In Mozambique, the major problem is that {{there is a}}n overall lack of demand for research by policy makers resulting in uncoordinated research without benefits for the population. If research coordination is improved in developing countries, the efficiency and efficacy of research will increase and better policies can be developed.

40|$|Three factors {{define the}} main {{difficulties}} faced by developing countries {{in the area of}} trade facilitation: (i) limited understanding and use by governments and business (especially SMEs) of trade facilitation and of ICT tools and techniques; (ii) developing countries' limited capacity for policy analysis and inadequate policy instruments for the implementation of trade facilitation, and (iii) <b>inadequate</b> policy <b>coordination</b> for negotiation on trade facilitation. These obstacles tend to reduce countries' development opportunities and to increase the costs of general economic development and social welfare. The United Nations, through its five regional commissions, is launching a project that seeks to disseminate the benefits of trade facilitation and the standards, tools and requirements for its successful implementation. The project will focus on trade facilitation promoted by: (a) enhanced knowledge and understanding of governments and business regarding trade facilitation and the role of ICT; (b) enhanced use of ICT by SMEs in trade facilitation, and (c) national capacity-building for trade facilitation negotiations...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty years, {{numerous}} international assistance programmes have aimed to provide support for reconstruction and assist the policy reform process in the Western Balkans. In this context, concerns have arisen that poor government policies and <b>inadequate</b> donor <b>coordination</b> have reduced the effectiveness of such assistance. The paper discusses the sources of policy success and policy failure of such international assistance programmes within a principal-agent framework that models the influence of misaligned objectives, differing incentive structures, asymmetric information and moral hazard facing the different actors in the institutional structure of assistance programmes. In this political economy approach the varying influences on multiple principals and agents are key determinants {{of the effectiveness of}} policy. The paper takes a sectoral view in examining assistance programmes in the vocational education sector, where large donor effort has been applied in the Western Balkans over the last decade to modernise and reform the education system.

25|$|The {{findings}} of the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) were released on March 2, 1993. Ultimately the investigation determined that the crew lost situational awareness, and though unsure of the air traffic control services being provided or their position, began an approach to Runway 5 from an excessive altitude and airspeed without completing the published approach procedures. Though critical of the performance of the flight crew, the report ultimately concluded that the probable cause was the failure of senior management of GP Express to provide adequate training and operational support for the startup of the southern operation, which resulted in the assignment of an inadequately prepared captain with a relatively inexperienced first officer in revenue passenger service and the failure of the flight crew to use approved instrument flight procedures, which resulted in a loss of situational awareness and terrain clearance. Contributing to the cause of the accident was GP Express’ failure to provide approach charts to each pilot and to establish stabilized approach criteria.
