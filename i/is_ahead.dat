5|$|While other European {{clubs have}} mainly marketed to {{international}} audiences, Bayern {{has focused on}} Germany. Forbes ranks Bayern as the world's fifth-most valuable football club in their annual list, estimating the club's value at US$1.235billion. As a result of Bayern's finals appearance in the 2012 UEFA Champions League, the club's brand value has reached US$786million, up 59% from the previous year. Among European teams, this <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> of Real Madrid's US$600million and behind first-placed Manchester United, whose brand is valued at US$853million. In 2013, Bayern overtook Manchester United to take first place in brand valuation.|$|E
5|$|Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) is outed at {{his school}} and {{subsequently}} bullied by his teammates {{in the locker}} room. He is also mercilessly attacked online. Karofsky, devastated, attempts suicide by hanging, but is saved in time by his father. The news causes shock at his old school, McKinley High: Members of the staff believe {{they could have done}} more to help him when he had been a student there, while Kurt blames himself for ignoring Karofsky's repeated phone calls that week. It also shocks Sebastian, who had cruelly rebuffed Karofsky at a gay bar, and he destroys the photos of Finn, thus abandoning his attempt at blackmail. New Directions coach Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has all of the members reveal something they are looking forward to in the future, to remind them that no matter how low they think their lives have sunk, they should not forget what <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> of them. Rachel and Finn apologize to each other, and decide to get married the day after Regionals.|$|E

5|$|Several basic {{offensive}} tactics {{come into}} play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating {{a gap in the}} infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even {{at the expense of the}} batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play. With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. The manager will sometimes signal a batter who <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.|$|E

25|$|When a foul is charged, {{the referee}} in their {{discretion}} may deduct {{one or more}} points as a penalty. If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional.

25|$|Another {{variant of}} scoring, a 12-frame system {{introduced}} at the November 2014 World Bowling Tour (WBT) finals, resembles golf's match play scoring in counting the {{greater number of}} frames won rather than measuring accumulated pinfall score. A frame may be won immediately by a higher pincount on the first roll of the frame, and a match may be won when one player <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> by more frames than remain of the possible 12 frames. This variant reduces match length and scoring complexity for two-player matches.|$|E
25|$|From 'No advantage'. Scoring method {{created by}} Jimmy Van Alen. The first player or doubles {{team to win}} four points wins the game, {{regardless}} of whether the player or team <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> by two points. When the game score reaches three points each, the receiver chooses which side of the court (advantage court or deuce court) the service is to be delivered on the seventh and game-deciding point. Utilized by World Team Tennis professional competition, ATP tours, WTA tours, ITF Pro Doubles and ITF Junior Doubles.|$|E

The “TB”-Sign is posted to indicate to the operator that an eight-car train (the longest used in the system) is clear of an interlocking (“turnback”) when the train front is flush with the sign, and that the train can turn back in the direction from which it came on the opposite track.|$|E

25|$|The {{other team}} then scrimmages {{the ball at}} the opponent's 35-yard line and has the same {{opportunity}} to score. After the teams have completed their possessions, if one team <b>is</b> <b>ahead,</b> then it is declared the winner; otherwise, the two teams each get another chance to score, scrimmaging from the other 35-yard line. After this second round, if {{there is still no}} winner, during the regular season the game ends as a tie. In a playoff game, the teams continue to attempt to score from alternating 35-yard lines, until one team is leading after both have had an equal number of possessions.|$|E
25|$|As {{explained}} below, long-term {{estimates of}} the length of the tropical year were used in connection with the reform of the Julian calendar, which resulted in the Gregorian calendar. Participants in that reform were only partially aware of the non-uniform rotation of the Earth, but now this can be taken into account to some degree. The amount that TT <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> of UT1 is known as ΔT, or Delta T. The table below gives Morrison and Stephenson's (S & M) 2004 estimates and standard errors (σ) for dates significant {{in the process of developing}} the Gregorian calendar.|$|E
25|$|Railroads {{proposed}} the end-of-train device (EOT or ETD) as an alternative. An ETD could {{be attached to}} the rear of the train to detect the train's air brake pressure and report any problems to the locomotive. The ETD also detects movement of the train upon start-up and radios this information to the engineers so they know all of the slack is out of the couplings and additional power could be applied. The machines also have blinking red lights to warn following trains that a train <b>is</b> <b>ahead.</b> With the introduction of the ETD, the conductor moved up to the front of the train with the engineer.|$|E

25|$|The {{center of}} mass is an {{important}} point on an aircraft, which significantly affects {{the stability of the}} aircraft. To ensure the aircraft is stable enough to be safe to fly, the {{center of mass}} must fall within specified limits. If the center of mass <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> of the forward limit, the aircraft will be less maneuverable, possibly {{to the point of being}} unable to rotate for takeoff or flare for landing. If the center of mass is behind the aft limit, the aircraft will be more maneuverable, but also less stable, and possibly so unstable that it is impossible to fly. The moment arm of the elevator will also be reduced, which makes it more difficult to recover from a stalled condition.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of a}} sighted guide {{by people}} in this class is {{dependent}} on the specific requirements of the sport. Guides are used in para-alpine and para-Nordic skiing. Guides for B2 and B3 skiers often position themselves differently from for B1 skiers as the skiers in this class have some vision, which means the things a guide assists with will be different from what is required of a skier who has almost no sight. The guide may ski in front of the skier and use visual cues to inform the skier of what <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> of them on the course. For cyclists in this class, a guide is used with the guide sitting at the front of a tandem bicycle.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{publications}} {{increased by}} 308% between 2005 and 2014, {{primarily as a}} result of Thomson Reuters' decision to track a much larger number of Brazilian journals in its database between 2006 and 2008. Despite this artificial boost, the pace of growth has slowed since 2011. Moreover, in terms of publications per capita, the country trails both the more dynamic emerging market economies and advanced economies, even if it <b>is</b> <b>ahead</b> of most of its neighbours. When it comes to impact, Brazil has lost a lot of ground in the past decade. One possible cause may be the speed with which enrolment in higher education has expanded since the mid-1990s, especially as concerns students passing through the federal system of universities, some of which have resorted to hiring inexperienced faculty, including candidates without doctorates.|$|E
