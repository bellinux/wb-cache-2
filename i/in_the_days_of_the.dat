5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old West, tales {{tended to}} grow with {{repeated}} telling, {{and a single}} fight might grow into a career-making reputation. For instance, the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral made legends of Wyatt Earp and the Outlaw Cowboy gang, but they were relatively minor figures before that conflict. Some gunslingers, such as Bat Masterson, actively engaged in self-promotion.

5|$|A {{successful}} {{invasion of}} Egypt would have several further advantages for the Byzantine Empire.

Furthermore, Manuel may have wanted to encourage Amalric's plans, not only to deflect the ambitions of the Latins away from Antioch, but also to create new opportunities for joint military ventures that would keep the King of Jerusalem in his debt, and would also allow the Empire to share in territorial gains.|$|E
