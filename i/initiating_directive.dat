Despite this evidence, limited research has examined HIV testing in these populations. Objectives. To examine factors associated with HIV testing, as well as motivations underlying testing behaviour, within five East African communities in Toronto. Methods. Secondary data analyses were conducted using cross-sectional data collected in face-to-face interviews with people from Toronto's Ethiopian, Kenyan, Somali, Tanzanian, and Ugandan communities. Logistic regression techniques were employed to assess factors associated with "ever vs. never testing," "repeat vs. non-repeat testing," and "independent vs. directive testing. " Reasons provided for testing and not testing were described. Results. Individuals from all five communities were interviewed (n= 270). Males were slightly over-represented (55. 9 %). The average age was 35. 7 yrs (range 17 - 71). Three-quarters (75. 6 %) of the sample had been tested for HIV. Two-thirds (65. 7 %) of testers had tested more than once and 40. 7 % had independently decided to get their most recent test. 71. 1 % of testers reporting previous testing for immigration purposes. Testing behaviour varied greatly across communities. Ethnicity was predictive of "ever" and "repeat" testing. Risk behaviour (including multiple sex partners, concurrent sex partners, condom non-use, and/or improper condom use) was overwhelmingly not associated with testing. Fear of exposure through sexual activity was the most frequent reason for independent testing. Immigration authorities were the most common person to <b>initiate</b> <b>directive</b> testing, followed by physicians. Low perceived risk {{was the most common}} reason for not testing. Conclusions. Testing rates within this population were quite high and the immigration process heavily impacted upon testing behaviour. Many determinants and motivations of testing have been identified and should be used to inform the design of interventions to promote testing behaviour in these communities. Nevertheless, many gaps have been identified by the current research and should be addressed by future research...|$|R

40|$|Background/Purpose: The Patient Self-Determination Act {{passed in}} 1990 brought great {{attention}} to the need of advance care directives (ACDs). In the United States, 18 - 36 % of adults have an ACD and {{less than half of}} adults with chronic and life threatening illnesses have completed ACDs. The purpose of this scholarly project was to increase the utilization of ACDs in a primary care clinic through staff education. The goal this project was to increase the rate of completion of ACDs. Methods: A Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model was used to <b>initiate</b> â€œAdvanced Care <b>Directives</b> for Patients in Primary Care". This project was implemented using the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (Rogers, 2003). A retrospective chart review was conducted on 100 charts to determine percentage of ACDs completion in a primary care clinic. An education session was organized to assist staff with initiating end-of-life care discussions. A pre/post education survey was administered to all participants. A second retrospective chart review was conducted sixty days after implementation. Conclusion: There was a 3. 5 fold increase in the completion of ACDs. Implication for Practice: Clinical education can increase the utilization of ACDS in primary care. D. N. P...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ed. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1999. This {{descriptive}} {{case study}} challenges {{the notion that}} top-down leadership is ineffective in engendering ownership and lasting commitment by those in the schools responsible for promoting educational change. My research examines {{the impact of a}} top-down <b>directive</b> <b>initiated</b> by a new superintendent on elementary principals and teachers. The directive, focused on teacher evaluation, required principals to effectively manage the routine activities within their school, {{while at the same time}} authentically demonstrating their value for instructional leadership by completing a minimum of 70 classroom observations during the school year. This study traces the implementation of the policy in a Pacific Northwest school district over the course of two years. It study focuses on the reflections, experiences and actions of six elementary principals and a sample of teachers in their schools. It examines the conditions within the organization and the human dynamics among the superintendent, principals, and teachers that promoted and challenged the policy implementation and ownership, and commitment to change. The actions of the superintendent are analyzed, first in an effort to see how one man elected to exercise leadership from his position of authority, and second to see how principals responded to the superintendent's initiative. And finally, this study examines the influence the policy had on principals' conception of their leadership role, how it altered their responsibilities, and the impact it had on the manner in which they worked with teachers...|$|R
40|$|The {{database}} <b>directive,</b> <b>initiated</b> by the European Commission in 1992 {{and due to}} be finalised in {{the near}} future, establishes a two-tiered system of protection, amending copyright with a sui generis rule that grants protection against unfair extraction. The terms of protection are extended if the producter makes "substantial changes" to update the database. This paper analyses the incentive to update created by the database directive. In contrast to the usual findings {{of the literature on}} the incentive effects of intellectual property rights, we find that, although in most cases the incentives to update a database are insufficient from society's point of view, the possibility of extending the term of protection by making 'substantial changes' in the database may create an incentive for excessive updating. This leads to conclusions about what should be considered a substantial changeDie in Datenbank-Direktive, deren endg Fassung in K vorliegen wird, garantiert Datanbankproduzenten einen zweistufigen Schutz: Neben dem Urheberrecht existier ein sui generis Recht das vor unlauteren Ausz sch und dessen Schutzdauer sich verl 4 ngert, wenn der Produzent die Datenbank durch substantielle 4 nderungen aktualisiert.

40|$|Whether life {{exists on}} worlds other than Earth {{is one of}} the most {{compelling}} questions facing space science today. Given that, on Earth, life exists wherever water is found, worlds harboring large amounts of water are prime targets in the search for an answer to this question. Jovian moons Europa, Callisto, and Ganymede; Saturnian moons Enceladus and Titan; and possibly Neptune's Triton are all worlds in the outer solar system on which large quantities of water can be found in solid and liquid form. So compelling are these worlds as targets for scientific study that the United States Congress recently <b>initiated</b> a <b>directive</b> to NASA to create an "Ocean Worlds Exploration Program, comprised of frequent small, medium and large missions that poses the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the solar system and life within it, perhaps more profoundly event than the modern-day search for past or extant life on Mars. Any life detected at the remote "ocean worlds" in the outer solar system would likely have formed and evolved along an independent path from life on Earth itself, giving us a deeper understanding of the potential for broad variety amongst life in the universe. In NASA's robotic study of Mars, a key to the success of the "search for water" was the ability to conduct iterative exploration via a series of missions launched on a regular cadence based on 26 -month cycles of prime planetary-alignment windows of reduced transit time. Through this cadence, NASA was able to send to Mars a series of orbiters and landers, using the knowledge gained from each mission to inform and refine the goals of the next. The ability to conduct iterative exploration in this manner could have a substantial impact on exploration of the "ocean worlds," allowing scientists to narrow their targets of interest in the search for life based on data sent back by successive missions. This ability is currently limited by the transit periods available from contemporary evolved expendable launch vehicles. In the case of Europa, one of the nearer of these ocean worlds, current transit times are seven to nine years; iterative exploration of Europa would require decades. In the coming decade, NASA's new Space Launch System (SLS) could revolutionize exploration of the outer solar system by dramatically reducing transit times. Designed to enable human exploration of deep space, SLS will be the world's most powerful launch vehicle, offering unparalleled payload mass and volume and departure energy. In the case of Europa, SLS will reduce transit time to two to three years, enabling an iterative exploration cadence closer to what is currently experienced for Mars. SLS competed its critical design review during summer 2015 and is making rapid progress toward initial launch readiness. This paper will provide background on the importance of these ocean worlds and an overview and status of SLS, and will discuss the potential for the use of SLS in a robust iterative search for life in our solar system...|$|R
40|$|What was <b>initiated</b> as a <b>directive</b> from {{a provincial}} {{government}} {{in an attempt}} {{to increase the number of}} critical care nurses has evolved into an exciting educational opportunity for many nurses and student nurses in the year 2000. Between 1993 and 1997 there has been significant downsizing of acute care beds across Canada (Code Blue: Critical Care Nursing in Nova Scotia, 1998). At the same time patient acuity has increased, due to shorter hospital stays, and the number of nurses working full-time has decreased with the increased use of casual nurses. Several studies at both the provincial and national levels report current and future shortages of specialized nurses (emergency, critical care and perioperative). It is expected that this shortage will continue into the future, a shortage that is driven by technological advances, as well as an aging general and nursing population. Continued shortages of these acute care nurses will result in fierce competition for skilled nurses as well as aggressive recruitment and retention strategies (Code Blue: Critical Care Nursing in Nova Scotia, 1998). It is generally agreed within the nursing community that specialty nurses in critical care require a unique body of knowledge that is not acquired in a basic undergraduate nursing program (Fitzsimmons, Hadley, & Shively, 1999). This specialized knowledge can be gained informally through experience; however, it is largely developed in additional formal education programs. The purpose of this article is to outline a strategy for the delivery of specialty education at three educational levels in acute care nursing with three streams: emergency, critical care and perioperative nursing. This clinical major option is to be delivered in partnership among the Queen Elizabeth Hospital II, the Health Science Centre and Dalhousie University School of Nursing, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. This model of offering specialty education in university preparation could be a template for preparing nurses in the new millennium. Language: English. Entry Date: 20001201. Revision Date: 20040326.
