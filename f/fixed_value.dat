5|$|Linderman {{ordered a}} review {{of the success of the}} trade dollar in China. It was {{discovered}} that the coins circulated reasonably well in southern China, but usage in the north was limited. As the price of silver decreased, employers in the United States began paying workers in trade dollars purchased at a discount. The situation frustrated the public, as the coins were widely disliked and many banks and businesses refused to accept them. In response, many towns, mostly in the western states, set a <b>fixed</b> <b>value</b> on trade dollars. Businesses which did accept trade dollars to avoid offending customers could not deposit them in banks or use them to pay taxes, and sold them to brokers. The brokers in turn recirculated the coins by selling them at a discount from face value to employers who included them in workers' pay packets. In 1883, members of the New York Mercantile Exchange petitioned Congress to allow redemption of the coins by the government.|$|E

3000|$|As {{noted in}} Fig. 10, {{the values of}} α and β are {{sensitive}} functions of the signal-to-noise ratio. It may cause the entire system to become very complex and lead to performance loss when both values are wrongly evaluated. Therefore, the simulation results for the <b>fixed</b> <b>values</b> are also presented to avoid the impact of wrong evaluation. The <b>fixed</b> <b>values</b> are selected in the SNR region having the gain of the joint iterative decoding compared to the perfect scrambling. The <b>fixed</b> <b>values</b> selected at low SNR region (≤ 1.5 dB) may cause critical error propagation at high SNR. In addition, the <b>fixed</b> <b>values</b> selected at high SNR region (≥ 2.8 dB) render it difficult to achieve the joint iterative decoding gain since the values are too small. Based on these rules, the values are selected as α= 0.07 and β= 0.18, which are optimized at 2.4 dB. The reasons for these values are as follows: (i) the JID at high SNR region has some of iterative decoding gain compared to the perfect scrambled LDPC code.

On the chosen date, 1 January 1977, the purchasing power of one Stelo was defined as equal to a half guilder; i.e., one guilder was set equal to two Steloj.|$|E

25|$|On 19 June 1916 Metzinger {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} (later renewed for 15 years) with the dealer, art collector and gallery owner Léonce Rosenberg. The agreement gave full rights for exhibitions and sales of Metzinger's production to Rosenberg. The contract fixed the prices of Metzinger's works bought by Rosenberg, who agreed to purchase {{a certain number of}} works (or a <b>fixed</b> <b>value)</b> every month. A contract between the two dated 1 January 1918 modified the first contract; the engagement was now renewable every two years, and prices of Metzinger's works purchased by Rosenberg increased.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the {{distance}} between Earth and Jupiter can be calculated using standard trigonometry, in particular the law of cosines, knowing two sides (distance between the Sun and Earth; distance between the Sun and Jupiter) and one angle (the angle between Jupiter and Earth as formed at the Sun) of a triangle. The distance from the Sun to Earth was not well known at the time, but taking it as a <b>fixed</b> <b>value</b> a, {{the distance}} from the Sun to Jupiter can be calculated as some multiple of a from Kepler's third law.|$|E

25|$|Small {{capacitors}} {{are used}} in electronic devices to couple signals between stages of amplifiers, as components of electric filters and tuned circuits, or as parts of power supply systems to smooth rectified current. Larger capacitors are used for energy storage in such applications as strobe lights, as parts of some types of electric motors, or for power factor correction in AC power distribution systems. Standard capacitors have a <b>fixed</b> <b>value</b> of capacitance, but adjustable capacitors are frequently used in tuned circuits. Different types are used depending on required capacitance, working voltage, current handling capacity, and other properties.|$|E
25|$|In Scotland teinds {{were the}} tenths of certain produce {{of the land}} {{appropriated}} {{to the maintenance of}} the Church and clergy. At the Reformation most of the Church property was acquired by the Crown, nobles and landowners. In 1567 the Privy Council of Scotland provided that a third of the revenues of lands should be applied to paying the clergy of the reformed Church of Scotland. In 1925 the system was recast by statute and provision was made for the standardisation of stipends at a <b>fixed</b> <b>value</b> in money. The Court of Session acted as the Teind Court. Teinds were finally abolished by section 56 of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000.|$|E

40|$|In {{connection}} with previously published work, {{this paper presents}} further results about the bounding properties of eigenvalues provided by a linear eigenmatrix formulation A - lambda B. The linear eigenmatrix is formed by expressing {{the elements of a}} non-linear dynamic stiffness matrix, K(lambda), as linear functions of the eigenparameter lambda. This is achieved by choosing two <b>fixed</b> <b>values</b> of the eigenparameter and calculating K(lambda) at these two values. The eigenvalues of A - lambda B provide error bounds on the exact eigenvalues of the non-linear eigenmatrix if the two <b>fixed</b> <b>values</b> chosen are below the lowest pole of K(lambda). Choosing two identical <b>fixed</b> <b>values,</b> the error bounds on the exact eigenvalues provided by traditional linearization techniques are found as special cases.
