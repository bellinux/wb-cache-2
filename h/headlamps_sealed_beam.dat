50|$|A <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> {{is a type}} of lamp with a {{parabolic}} reflector, one or more filaments, and a {{glass or}} polycarbonate lens sealed permanently together as a unit. Originally introduced for road vehicle <b>headlamp</b> service, <b>sealed</b> <b>beams</b> have since been applied elsewhere. Halogen <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> lamps incorporate a halogen lamp within a quartz or hard glass envelope.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, Federal {{lighting}} regulations required <b>headlamps</b> of <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> {{construction and}} standard {{size and shape}} on all vehicles, so Accords in North America were equipped with four rectangular headlamp units rather than the aerodynamic composite replaceable-bulb units used on Accords sold outside North America (note European specification imagery). Other Automotive lighting variations included amber front and red rear side marker lights and reflectors in North America, and headlamp washers and a red rear fog lamp for European markets. Japanese-market Accords were unique from all other markets in that they included adjustable ride height control and side view mirrors installed on the mid-forward fenders.|$|R
25|$|The first {{electric}} headlamp {{light source}} was the tungsten filament, {{operating in a}} vacuum or inert-gas atmosphere inside the <b>headlamp</b> bulb or <b>sealed</b> <b>beam.</b> Compared to newer-technology light sources, tungsten filaments give off small amounts of light relative to the power they consume. Also, during normal operation of such lamps, tungsten boils off {{the surface of the}} filament and condenses on the bulb glass, blackening it. This reduces the light output of the filament and blocks some of the light that would pass through an unblackened bulb glass, though blackening was less of a problem in <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> units; their large interior surface area minimized the thickness of the tungsten accumulation. For these reasons, plain tungsten filaments are all but obsolete in automotive headlamp service.|$|R

50|$|<b>Sealed</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> were {{introduced}} in the United States in 1939, and became mandatory from the following year until the 1984 model year. Cars prior and subsequent to that date could {{have a variety of}} shapes of headlamps, using any {{of a wide variety of}} replaceable bulbs. Halogen <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> appeared on U.S. cars in 1978 to enable halogen technology under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, which at the time required all headlamps to be of <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> construction; eventually halogen <b>sealed</b> <b>beams</b> came to dominate the <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> lamp market.|$|R
5000|$|Essentially a re-styled Triumph Bonneville, the [...] "West Coast" [...] styled TSX was {{distinguished}} by its lowered chassis and 16 in rear wheel {{with the engine}} off-set in the frame to accommodate this. Other changes, whilst unique to the model, were cosmetic including stepped seat, black finished engine with polished fins, re-styled passenger grabrail, shortened front and rear painted mudguards, the latter having a black plastic extension for the larger UK vehicle numberplate, chromed shorty megaphone exhausts with the crossover pipe hidden between them under the bike and flowing thru 1.75" [...] pipes, Morris alloy wheels (then made by Performance Machine) and 'retro' stick on graphics outlined in the usual gold hand pinstriping. Paioli rear suspension units, with plastic top shrouds, were sited at a more acute angle further back on the swinging arm to lower the seat height. A slightly lower rise and wider USA style handlebar was fitted and chromed Lucas turn indicators returned {{in place of the}} black plastic ULO items that had replaced them on other Triumph models from 1981. A chromed wire mounted Lucas <b>headlamp</b> with <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> was changed to the Lucas H4 early in the production run. A Brembo rear brake master cylinder was fitted in place of the usual Automotive Products (AP) Lockheed item which remained for the front, as well as supplying both calipers. Dual front discs were an option. Whilst the 1982-1983 brochure showed Goodyear Eagle tyres fitted, an Avon Roadrunner rear and Speedmaster front tyre went on production models, the tyres' lettering picked out in white. Although the German magazine Motorad road-tested a kick start-only version, the kickstart was an optional extra on the production TSX. The standard TSX engine was a T140ES (electric start) [...] with two 32-mm Bing carburettors and electronic ignition. The engine was offset to accommodate the fatter rear tyre within the frame which also necessitated a unique swingarm and abbreviated chromed chainguard. The engine also benefitted from an updated crank with more careful machining; the result being greatly reduced vibration. The TSX fuel tank was a unique design for the model having only one Paioli left hand petrol tap situated ahead to accommodate the larger Bing carburettors. This tank also had a centralised filler hole with optional locking cap and a balance pipe situated {{on the front of the}} tank's underside.|$|R
2500|$|The {{standardized}} [...] round <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp,</b> one per side, {{was required}} for all vehicles sold in the United States from 1940, virtually freezing usable lighting technology in place until the 1970s, for Americans. In 1957, the law was amended to allow smaller [...] round <b>sealed</b> <b>beams,</b> two per side of the vehicle, and in 1974 rectangular <b>sealed</b> <b>beams</b> were permitted as well.|$|R
25|$|US laws {{required}} <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> on all vehicles between 1940 and 1983, {{and other}} countries such as Japan, United Kingdom and Australia also made extensive use of <b>sealed</b> <b>beams.</b> In most other countries, and in the US since 1984, replaceable-bulb headlamps predominate.|$|R

5000|$|In stage lighting, <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> lamps {{are often}} used. A common size, {{also used in}} rock concerts, as well as outdoor {{architectural}} lighting, is the parabolic aluminized reflector 64 (PAR64). PAR64 <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> lamps are typically available with 250, 500 or 1000 watt power ratings. The fixtures that such <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> lights go into are called [...] "PAR cans". Beam spreads are designated as FL (flood), SP (spot), NSP (narrow spot), and VNSP (very narrow spot), as stamped {{on the back of}} the lamp's reflector.|$|R

25|$|Technology {{moved forward}} {{in the rest of}} the world. The first halogen lamp for vehicle {{headlamp}} use, the H1, was introduced in 1962 by a European consortium of bulb and headlamp makers. Shortly thereafter, headlamps using the new light source were introduced in Europe. These were effectively prohibited in the US, where standard-size <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> were mandatory and intensity regulations were low. US lawmakers faced pressure to act, both due to lighting effectiveness and vehicle aerodynamics/fuel savings. High beam peak intensity, capped at 140,000 candela per side of the car in Europe, was limited in the United States to 37,500 candela on each side of the car until 1978, when the limit was raised to 75,000. An increase in high beam intensity to take advantage of the higher allowance could not be achieved without a move to halogen technology, and so <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> with internal halogen burners became available for use on 1979 models in the United States. Halogen <b>sealed</b> <b>beams</b> now dominate the <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> market, which has declined steeply since replaceable-bulb headlamps were permitted in 1983.|$|R

At the same time the original 7 in round <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> headlights were replaced with square <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> units on all models except the van, together with a general styling and mechanical upgrade. A three-speed automatic gearbox was also available on the bigger engined models, it was first introduced (on the 1400) at the end of June 1978.|$|R

25|$|Headlamp systems require {{periodic}} maintenance. <b>Sealed</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> are modular; {{when the}} filament burns out, the entire <b>sealed</b> <b>beam</b> is replaced. Most vehicles in North America made {{since the late}} 1980s use headlamp lens-reflector assemblies that are considered {{a part of the}} car, and just the bulb is replaced when it fails. Manufacturers vary the means by which the bulb is accessed and replaced. Headlamp aim must be properly checked and adjusted frequently, for misaimed lamps are dangerous and ineffective.|$|R
