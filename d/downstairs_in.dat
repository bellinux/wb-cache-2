5|$|Mulder {{is driven}} back to Area 51 {{along with two}} other Men in Black, Howard Grodin and Jeff Smoodge. After an angry {{telephone}} call from Fletcher's wife, Joanne, Mulder—still inside Fletcher's body—goes to Fletcher's home. Instead of sleeping in the bedroom, he decides to sleep <b>downstairs</b> <b>in</b> an easy chair and watch pornography. When he is awoken by Joanne, he mumbles Scully's name. While changing his clothes, Mulder receives {{a telephone call from}} Smoodge, who explains that the military has surveyed the wreckage of the craft from the night before, finding one of the human pilots merged into a rock but still alive. Another soldier, Captain Robert McDonough, had switched bodies with an elderly Hopi woman, as evident from McDonough's aberrant behavior.|$|E
5|$|The Sopranos won and was {{nominated}} for a large number of awards over the course of its original broadcast. It {{was nominated}} for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in every year it was eligible, and is the first cable TV series to receive a nomination for the award. After being nominated for and losing the award in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2003 (losing the first time to The Practice and the last three to The West Wing), The Sopranos won the award in 2004, and again in 2007. Its 2004 win made The Sopranos the first series on a cable network to win the award, while its 2007 win made the show the first drama series since Upstairs, <b>Downstairs</b> <b>in</b> 1977 to win the award after it had finished airing. The show earned 21 nominations for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series and won the award six times, with creator David Chase receiving three awards.|$|E
5|$|When the Kindred escort {{the agents}} {{out of the}} village, Mulder {{comments}} {{on the lack of}} children in the community and states that he recognizes some of the faces from photographs taken in the 1930s. Curious, he returns to the village that night, and hears chanting as a procession of the Kindred moves to a barn. Scully is led off by Brother Andrew, who claims {{to be able to give}} her information about the murderer, whom he calls Brother Martin. <b>Downstairs</b> <b>in</b> the barn, the group can be seen bathing Brother Aaron's body in watery clay. Mulder hides in a crevice, where he discovers that the sick man has been buried alive and has begun to take on feminine features. Meanwhile, Brother Andrew uses his power to seduce Scully. She is unable to resist, and is on the verge of succumbing before Mulder comes to her aid. The agents are again escorted out of the village.|$|E

25|$|While Sano was {{initially}} scared, {{according to her}} own statements, she eventually just gave up and accepted her fate. Allegedly, the kidnapper kept her tied up for several months and used a stun gun for punishments {{if she did not}} videotape the horse racing on TV. Sano was also threatened with a knife and beatings. Her kidnapper shared his men's clothes with her and gave her food three times per day, either instant food or meals cooked by his mother, who lived <b>downstairs</b> <b>in</b> the house. He also cut Sano's hair. Since there was no bath or toilet upstairs where Sano was confined, she was only able to take a bath infrequently, when permitted by her captor.|$|E

25|$|Regardless, {{the plans}} of Wagenknecht, Reed & Co. {{to fight it}} out at the 1919 Emergency National Convention {{continued}} apace. With the most radical state organizations effectively purged by the Regulars (Massachusetts, Minnesota) or unable to participate (Ohio, Michigan), and the Left Wing language federations suspended, a big majority of the hastily elected delegates to the gathering were controlled by the Executive Secretary Adolph Germer and the Regulars. A group of Left Wingers without delegate credentials, including John Reed and his sidekick Benjamin Gitlow, {{made an effort to}} occupy chairs on the convention floor before the gathering was called into order. The incumbents were unable to block the Left Wingers at the door, but soon called the already present police to their aid, and the officers of the law obligingly expelled the boisterous radicals from the hall. With the Credentials Committee firmly {{in the hands of the}} Regulars from the outset, the outcome of the gathering was no longer in doubt and most of the remaining Left Wing delegates departed, to meet with other co-thinkers <b>downstairs</b> <b>in</b> a previously reserved room in a parallel convention. It was this gathering which established itself as the Communist Labor Party on August 31, 1919.|$|E
500|$|The police entered around 7:54am with a {{sledgehammer}} {{through the back}} door. The door had been locked from the inside, with the key still in the lock.

In what order the family was killed is not known. A telephone was lying on one of the kitchen surfaces with its receiver off the hook, next to several [...]22 shells. The police said chairs and stools were overturned, and there was broken crockery, a broken sugar basin, and what looked like blood on the floor. A ceiling light lampshade had been broken.|$|E

500|$|Best {{had been}} good friends with Neil Aspinall since 1961 when he rented {{a room in the}} house where Best lived with his parents. Best asked Aspinall to become the band's road manager and {{personal}} assistant; accepting the job, he bought an old Commer van for £80 (equivalent to £ in [...] ).. Aspinall was waiting for Best <b>downstairs</b> <b>in</b> Epstein's NEMS record shop after the dismissal meeting. The two went to the Grapes pub on Mathew Street, the same street as the Cavern Club where the group had played. Aspinall was furious at the news, insisting to Best that he would also resign from the Beatles. Best strongly advised him to remain with the group. Aspinall's relationship with Mona Best (and their three-week-old baby, Roag) was ended. At the next concert Aspinall asked Lennon why they had fired Best, to which he replied [...] "It's {{got nothing to do with}} you, you're only the driver." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2011 Lancashire began {{starring}} {{in a new}} Cameron Mackintosh musical, Betty Blue Eyes, at the Novello Theatre. In the production, a loose adaptation of the 1984 film A Private Function, she starred as Joyce Chilvers, an aspirational housewife who Lancashire describes as [...] "brittle" [...] and [...] "capricious". Despite positive reviews the musical closed in London on 24 September 2011, after a run of just six months. For her performance Lancashire was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical. In 2012 she appeared as lady's maid Miss Whisset in the penultimate episode of the 2010 revival of Upstairs <b>Downstairs.</b> <b>In</b> September 2012 Lancashire began appearing as Head of Ladieswear Miss Audrey in the six-part series The Paradise set in a department store in Northern England in the late 19th century. Lancashire described her character as [...] "a true archetypal spinster" [...] who has long denied herself a romantic life and who begins to feel undermined by a younger colleague.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} winter, {{the band}} began their first overseas tour. In February 2005, they toured the United Kingdom – playing London, Manchester, Milton Keynes, Chester, and Liverpool – and then followed it by playing some gigs in the Netherlands {{to coincide with}} the release of the Dutch translation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince which took place in November 2005. In the Netherlands, they played one of their earliest songs [...] "Platform Nine and 3/4" [...] in Dutch. In late 2005, Harry and the Potters enjoyed more tongue-in-cheek critical success from respectable quarters. The web based music ’zine Pitchfork Media even hailed Harry and the Potters as having one of the best five live shows in 2005, quipping that [...] "The Decemberists wish they could lit-rock like this." [...] In the fall of 2005, Joe entered Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts.

500|$|When {{work on the}} Marble Hall {{was being}} done, from 1944–1948, the {{assistant}} pastor of Mount St. Peter's was Father George Goralka, who executed an inscription around the central nave of {{the ceiling of the}} Marble Hall, Christ's proclamation of Peter's Primacy: [...] "Blessed art thou Simon Son of Jona and I say to thee, thou art Peter and upon this Rock I will build my Church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it, and I will give thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatever thou shall bind on earth shall be bound in Heaven and whatever thou shall loose on earth shall be loosed in Heaven." [...] The basement was called the Marble Hall after completion and the name stuck. The Marble Hall is mostly used for special breakfasts and dinners, and for fish fry fundraisers during Lent. The hall also serves as the parish's Italian Restaurant during the Festa Italiana each August. On special holidays when more parishioners than usual attend Mass, which usually include Christmas, Palm Sunday, and Easter, the Mass is said in both the upstairs of the church and <b>downstairs</b> <b>in</b> the Marble Hall.|$|E
500|$|Best {{was sacked}} from the Beatles on 16 August 1962, by manager Brian Epstein acting {{on behalf of}} Lennon, McCartney and Harrison. Accounts vary of Aspinall during this event. According to MerseyBeat editor Bill Harry, Aspinall was waiting <b>downstairs</b> <b>in</b> Epstein's NEMS record shop, and {{was the first one to}} talk to the by then ex-Beatle in the Grapes pub, across from the Cavern. Aspinall was furious and said that he would stop working for the band as well, but Best {{strongly}} advised him not to. Aspinall asked McCartney and Lennon at the next concert why they had fired Best and was told, [...] "It’s got nothing to do with you. You’re only the driver." [...] However, in a 2007 interview, Aspinall provided Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn with a distinctly different version of events, saying that he was physically present when Epstein sacked Best, that he told Best unprompted that he planned to continue working for the band, and that on his first subsequent encounter with the other band members, their first question to him was how Best had taken being sacked. At any rate, Aspinall stayed with the band, but he ended his affair with Best's mother, a relationship that had led to the birth of baby Vincent [...] "Roag" [...] Best. Aspinall denied the story for years before publicly acknowledging that he was indeed Roag's father.|$|E
500|$|The Back to the Future trilogy is parodied and {{referenced}} {{throughout the}} episode, {{along with many}} other movies and famous people throughout the 1980s. Other cultural references include how after going back in time, Peter becomes excited about his new prospects in life, and states to Cleveland {{that he is going to}} [...] "raise more hell than Hellraiser" [...] from the 1987 horror film Hellraiser. It also depicts Pinhead as weak and ridiculous, stating that the worst he can do is unscrew a salt shaker and trick someone into using it, causing salt to come out all over their food. The first scene where Lois appears at the swimming pool is a reference to a scene from the 1980 film Caddyshack, featuring the song [...] "Mr. Night" [...] by Kenny Loggins. Once Lois appears, she asks Peter if he would like to see the 1982 film Zapped!. Rejecting her offer, Peter decides to go partying with Cleveland instead and play the video game Menstrual Ms. Pac-Man, in addition to making out with actress Molly Ringwald. While there, Brian gets into a fight, and instructs the bar patron to meet him on top of the World Trade Center to fight him at eight A.M. on September 11, 2001. While <b>downstairs</b> <b>in</b> the alternate universe, Peter makes a reference to the Twilight Zone episode, [...] "The Eye of the Beholder." [...] The joke about the World Trade Center has been edited from current versions of the show accessible on Netflix as of January 2012. Returning to the present, Peter and Brian decide to watch television, and are shocked to discover that actor Chevy Chase is now the host of The Tonight Show. They also discover that former Vice President Al Gore is now President of the United States, and flying cars running on vegetable oil exist. A parody of the 1962 ABC animated series, Hanna-Barbera's The Jetsons, is then shown. In the alternate reality, Death refers to the Dick Cheney hunting accident, explaining that the [...] "Chairman of Halliburton" [...] accidentally shot and killed Karl Rove, Antonin Scalia, and Tucker Carlson (Brian groans that Peter and he can't change this wonderful future, but Peter flatly says [...] "I don't know who any of those people are"). The main plot of the episode, complete with the scene in which Peter and Brian are in the living room, with Brian explaining to Peter what happened using a chalk board, is a reference to the alternate universe scene in Back to the Future Part II.|$|E

Connecting doors between cars are either at the (higher) upper floor or at an intermediate level over the bogies. In the former case, connecting directly to a single level car causes drag and connecting door problems.|$|E
2500|$|After {{her third}} divorce, Lake drifted between cheap hotels in New York City, and was arrested several times for public {{drunkenness}} and disorderly conduct. In 1962, a New York Post reporter found her {{living at the}} all-women's Martha Washington Hotel in Manhattan, working as a waitress <b>downstairs</b> <b>in</b> the cocktail lounge.
