Magnesium is used as the anode and silver chloride or cuprous chloride is used as the cathode in the prototype <b>demonstration.</b> <b>Adding</b> water or aqueous solutions activate the electrochemical reactions between the anode and cathode to release electricity. Experimentally, a maximum output voltage was measured at 1. 65 V using silver chloride cathode and the maximum operation capacity has been demonstrated {{to be more than}} 1. 86 mWh when an electrode area of 12 mm × 12 mm was used. As such, these microbatteries have great potential to be integrated with micro devices as the power sources for microsystems, such as disposable diagnostics and BioMEMS chips...|$|R

40|$|Several {{observations}} {{suggest an}} {{interaction of the}} sodium channel alpha-subunit with the cytoskeletal structures. However, {{there is a wide}} variability in the results of experiments of heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes and studies on mammalian cells are sometimes contradictory. In general, there has been no direct <b>demonstration</b> that <b>ad</b> hoc large perturbations of the cytoskeleton modify the intrinsic properties of the sodium channels expressed endogenously or heterologously in plasma membranes. We have studied in CHO cells transfected with the rat muscle sodium channel alpha-subunit the effects of two substances expected to produce drastic perturbations of the cytoskeletal structure: Cytochalasin-D, which depolymerizes microfilaments, and Colchicine, which inhibits the microtubules polymerization. We observed no significant differences in the voltage dependence, kinetic parameters and surface density of the expressed sodium channels after treatment of the cells with these substances. We conclude that the two known main components of the cytoskeleton do not interfere directly with the sodium channel function or with the heterologous expression of channels in the cell membrane...|$|R
40|$|Globally, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) desalinates {{the largest}} {{capacity}} of seawater but through energy-intensive thermal {{processes such as}} multi-stage flash (MSF) distillation (> 10 kW h per m 3 of desalinated water, including electrical and thermal energies). In other regions where fossil energy is more expensive and not subsidized, seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) {{is the most common}} desalination technology but it is still energy-intensive (3 - 4 kW h_e/m 3). Both processes therefore lead to the emission of significant amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Moreover, MSF and SWRO technologies are most often used for large desalination facilities serving urban centers with centralized water distribution systems and power grids. While renewable energy (RE) sources could be used to serve centralized systems in urban centers and thus provide an opportunity to make desalination greener, they are mostly used to serve rural communities off of the grid. In the KSA, solar and geothermal energy are of most relevance in terms of local conditions. Our group is focusing on developing new desalination processes, adsorption desalination (AD) and membrane distillation (MD), which can be driven by waste heat, geothermal or solar energy. A <b>demonstration</b> solar-powered <b>AD</b> facility has been constructed and a life cycle assessment showed that a specific energy consumption of < 1. 5 kW h_e/m 3 is possible. An innovative hybrid approach has also been explored which would combine solar and geothermal energy using an alternating 12 -h cycle to reduce the probability of depleting the heat source within the geothermal reservoir and provide the most effective use of RE without the need for energy storage. This paper highlights the use of RE for desalination in KSA with a focus on our group's contribution in developing innovative low energy-driven desalination technologies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The design and cost estimates for a demonstration plant to produce coal-water fuel (CWF) from low-sulfur Alaskan subbituminous coal were further reviewed to resolve issues of budget and plant capability. A preliminary evaluation was performed of potential cost and performance benefits to {{be derived from}} integrating the CWF plant with the <b>demonstration</b> of the <b>AD</b> Little/Cooper Bessemer CWF-fired diesel engine under the DOE Clean Coal Technology demonstration program. Tests on the Cooper Bessemer engine using Alaskan CWF prepared by the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) were recommended to determine engine performance at two levels of coal cleaning: physical cleaning to about 3 % [...] 4 % ash or additional chemical cleaning to under 2 % ash (dry basis). Assistance was provided to graduate students in the Energy Engineering doctoral program at the University of North Dakota in reference to policy papers prepared by them on advanced power options, repowering strategies, and waste management.

40|$|Abstract—OpenAirInterface (www. openairinterface. org) is an {{experimental}} real-time {{hardware and software}} platform for airinterface experimentation. It comes in two configurations, cellular and cooperative mesh network topologies. Here we present the platform architecture for mesh networks. The network is organized in clusters, where dynamically-allocated cluster-heads (CHs) manage radio resources. CHs are typically the bestconnected nodes in a particular geographical area and are synchronized in a distributed fashion by using special relaying nodes on the cluster boundaries. The physical (PHY) layer of the platform targets WiMax and UMTS LTE like networks and thus uses MIMO-OFDMA as modulation and multiple access technique. The current hardware supports 5 MHz bandwidth and two transmit/receive antennas. The media access (MAC) layer of the platform supports an abundant two-way signalling for enabling collaboration, scheduling protocols as well as traffic and channel measurements. The platform is designed for a full software-radio implementation, {{in the sense that}} all protocol layers run on the host PCs under the control of a Linux real time operation system. Applications of the OpenAirMesh platform include <b>demonstration</b> of broadband <b>ad</b> hoc communications systems for public safety units as well as demonstration of collaborative communication in a cognitive radio system. In addition to the basic architecture of OpenAirMesh we highlight some application examples. I...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} (AD) has {{the opportunity}} to {{be an integral part of}} the solution to two of the most pressing environmental concerns of urban centers: waste management and renewable energy. Through AD, organics are decomposed by specialized bacteria in an oxygen-depleted environment to produce biogas and a stable solid. Each of these products can be used for beneficial purposes to close the loop in organic waste management. The biogas, which consists of up to 65 % methane, can be combusted in a cogeneration unit and produce green energy. The solid digestate can be used as an organic soil amendment. As a waste management strategy employed in over 20 countries, AD has been successful in reducing the volume of waste going to landfill, decreasing emissions of greenhouse gases and creating organic fertilizer, all at a profit. Despite global success, the United States has not employed AD on a large scale, and nowhere is it used to treat MSW. This paper outlines the processes of AD, reviews the current technology available and proposes the adoption of the technology in the United States, beginning with commercial waste in New York City. The greatest concerns for New York are space and transportation, indicating that the most appropriate system is one using high solids located near the site of waste generation. Therefore, the Hunt’s Point Market in the Bronx is an ideal location for a <b>demonstration</b> facility for <b>AD.</b> This plant will improve local environmental conditions, create jobs, and generate electricity. For the plant to be economically viable, public policy must proactively support AD...|$|R
40|$|Six Sigma {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{innovative}} and successful methodologies to have been introduced in recent years at an industrial level. The goal of this approach is to increase the efficiency of the company system and to generally reduce the costs involved in the production process. The instruments used are mainly statistical: a representative CTQ characteristic is studied for each Six Sigma Project, and the causes of any non-conformities found, as well as their effects on the system, are analysed. This makes it possible to evaluate the best choice for optimising the system and to identify the risk associated with each choice; Six Sigma is, therefore, generally used for optimising processes. After an initial Define phase, Six Sigma can be subdivided into the following phases: Measure, Analyze, Improve & Control. Product optimisation can be developed in greater detail by using Design For Six Sigma (DFSS) techniques during the Improve phase. These techniques adopt a statistical approach in order to assess which design solutions are best and the system response associated with the solution chosen. The aims of this paper are as follows. Firstly, to demonstrate that the DFSS techniques used for calculating a given process capability can interface with the Axiomatic Design (AD) schematisation of the product. In particular the meaning and use of the first and second axiom is focused on as a <b>demonstration</b> of how <b>AD</b> can be used within the framework of Six Sigma product optimisation. Secondly to demonstrate how the AD approach can be advantageous not only in the Improve phase, but also in the other phases of th...|$|R
5000|$|In ancient China {{there were}} many {{domestic}} and public pleasures in the rich urban environment unique to the Song dynasty. For the austere and hardworking peasantry, annual festivals and holidays provided a time of joy and relaxation, and for the poorest it meant a chance to borrow food and alcoholic drink so that everyone could join in the celebration. People would gather around their local sanctuary to observe the festival's games, theatrical entertainments, juggling, clowning, and other performances. The festivities on New Years were considered {{the most important of}} the year by the Chinese, its momentous occasion correlating with the beginning of February on the Western calendar. Preparations for the New Years festival took place over a month's time, as people busied themselves painting door gods, crafting paper streamers with lucky characters for [...] "welcoming the spring," [...] making printed images of Zhong Kui, and cooking special kinds of foods such as porridge of red haricot beans. The widely popular Lantern Festival was held every 15th day of 1st lunar month. According to the literatus and official Zhou Mi (1232-1298 AD), during the Xiao-Zong period (1163-1189 AD) the best lantern festivals were held at Suzhou and Fuzhou, while Hangzhou was also known for the its great variety of colorful paper lanterns, in all shapes and sizes. Meng Yuanlao (active 1126-1147) recalled in Dongjing Meng Hua Lu (Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital) how the earlier Northern Song capital at Kaifeng would host festivals with tens of thousands of colorful and brightly lit paper lanterns hoisted on long poles up and down the main street, the poles also wrapped in colorful silk with numerous dramatic paper figures flying in the wind like fairies. There were also other venerated holidays, such as the Qingming Festival, as it was supposedly this period of the year that was depicted in the artwork (mentioned above) by the artist Zhang Zeduan (although some would argue the painting actually represented the time of autumn in the year).With the advent of the discovery of gunpowder in China, lavish fireworks displays could also be held during festivities. For example, the martial <b>demonstration</b> in 1110 <b>AD</b> to entertain the court of Emperor Huizong, when it was recorded that a large fireworks display was held alongside Chinese dancers in strange costumes moving through clouds of colored smoke in their performance. The common people also purchased firecrackers from city shopkeepers and vendors, made of simple sticks of bamboo filled with a small amount of gunpowder.|$|R
