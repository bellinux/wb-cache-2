40|$|The dico vali (disco net) is an {{adaptation}} of the triple-walled <b>entangling</b> <b>net,</b> the trammel net, which, in India, has hitherto been confined to reservoir and estuarine fisheries.

Thousands of these nets have been sold within {{a period of a}} month in the district is unprecedented, and stands proof to the impressive performance of the gear so far.

The use of other forms of nets, such as seines, cast nets, and trawls, was restricted, but not totally eliminated. The primary species of finfish landed with <b>entangling</b> <b>nets</b> included striped mullet, spotted sea trout, Spanish mackerel, sheepshead, pompano and bluefish.

40|$|Attempting to {{contribute}} {{with the knowledge}} about the bioecological aspects concerning the youth forms of M. furnieri (Desmarest, 1823) and C. leiarchus (Cuvier, 1830) from Itacorubi mangrove, 15 samplings were taken from January 1988 to March 1989. Using casting and <b>entangle</b> <b>nets,</b> a total of 308 individuais from these species were captured. Their abundanee were: M. furnieri N = 197 (64, 0 %); C. leiarchus N = 111 (36, 0 %).

Concerning spatial distribution of the species, {{it was observed that}} M. furnieri occurred in all areas and C. leiarchus was not captured only in "D" area (Sertão River).

40|$|Molecular {{organization}} of {{donor and acceptor}} chromophores in self-assembled materials is of paramount interest {{in the field of}} photovoltaics or mimicry of natural light-harvesting systems. With this in mind, a redox-active porous interpenetrated metal-organic framework (MOF), {Cd(bpdc) (bpNDI) ] 4. 5 H(2) ODMF}(n) (1) has been constructed from a mixed chromophoric system. The -oxo-bridged secondary building unit, {Cd- 2 (-OCO) (2) }, guides the parallel alignment of bpNDI (N,N-di(4 -pyridyl) - 1, 4, 5, 8 -naphthalenediimide) acceptor linkers, which are tethered with bpdc (bpdcH(2) = 4, 4 -biphenyldicarboxylic acid) linkers of another <b>entangled</b> <b>net</b> in the framework, resulting in photochromic behaviour through inter-net electron transfer. Encapsulation of electron-donating aromatic molecules in the electron-deficient channels of 1 leads to a perfect donor-acceptor co-facial organization, resulting in long-lived charge-separated states of bpNDI. Furthermore, 1 and guest encapsulated species are characterised through electrochemical studies for understanding of their redox properties...|$|R

40|$|The fish {{assemblage}} and its exploitation in the Nové Mlýny reservoirs in 1986 – 2008 were analysed. Occurrence of 41 {{fish species}} (from 12 families) and 3 - 5 types of hybrids were registered. Newly the tubenose goby (Proterorhinus marmoratus) invaded the Věstonice and Nové Mlýny reservoirs. Dominance of autochthonous (riverine) fish species decreased. On the contrary, expressive increasing of Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio) and wels catfish (Silurus glanis) was ascertained. Average values of fish species diversity (H') and catch effort by <b>entangling</b> <b>netting</b> (C. P. U. E.) were 1, 36 and 53. 11 g. m 2. h- 1, respectively. The overall yearly yield in the Nové Mlýny reservoirs reached its maximum values in 1994 and 1995 with 153. 1 and 148. 8 kg. h- 1 (474. 6 and 461. 3 tons). Annual fish catch (inclusive of common carp Cyprinus carpio) since 1995 to 2008 subsequently decreased.

5000|$|Fishing {{boats are}} {{generally}} small, often {{little more than}} 30 m but up to 100 m for a large tuna or whaling ship. Aboard a fish processing vessel, the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs. In 2004, 85800000 t of fish {{were caught in the}} marine capture fishery. Anchoveta represented the largest single catch at 10700000 t. [...] That year, the top ten marine capture species also included Alaska pollock, Blue whiting, Skipjack tuna, Atlantic herring, Chub mackerel, Japanese anchovy, Chilean jack mackerel, Largehead hairtail, and Yellowfin tuna. [...] Other species including salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, squid and crab, are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is fishing by nets, such as purse seine, beach seine, lift <b>nets,</b> gillnets, or <b>entangling</b> <b>nets.</b> Another is trawling, including bottom trawl. Hooks and lines are used in methods like long-line fishing and hand-line fishing. Another method is the use of fishing trap.|$|R

40|$|The recent likely {{extinction}} of the baiji (Chinese river dolphin [Lipotes vexillifer]) (Turvey et al. 2007) makes the vaquita (Gulf of California porpoise [Phocoena sinus]) the most endangered cetacean. The vaquita has the smallest range of any porpoise, dolphin, or whale and, like the baiji, {{has long been}} threatened primarily by accidental deaths in fishing gear (bycatch) (Rojas-Bracho et al. 2006). Despite repeated recommendations from scientific bodies and conservation organizations, no effective actions {{have been taken to}} remove nets from the vaquita’s environment. Here, we address three questions that are important to vaquita conservation: (1) How many vaquitas remain? (2) How much time is left to find a solution to the bycatch problem? and (3) Are further abundance surveys or bycatch estimates needed to justify the immediate removal of all <b>entangling</b> <b>nets</b> from the range of the vaquita? Our answers are, in short: (1) there are about 150 vaquitas left, (2) there are at most 2 years within which to find a solution, and (3) further abundance surveys or bycatch estimates are not needed. The answers to the first two questions make clear that action is needed now, whereas the answer to the last question removes the excuse of uncertainty as a delay tactic. Herein we explain our reasoning...|$|R
