5|$|Parthian {{architecture}} adopted {{elements of}} Achaemenid and Greek architecture, but remained {{distinct from the}} two. The style is first attested at Mithridatkert/Nisa. The Round Hall of Nisa is similar to Hellenistic palaces, but different in that it forms a circle and vault inside a square space. However, the artwork of Nisa, including marble statues and the carved scenes on ivory rhyton vessels, <b>is</b> <b>unquestionably</b> influenced by Greek art.|$|E

While the style and design of the building <b>is</b> <b>unquestionably</b> Gothic, it resembles no building constructed during the Middle Ages. The forms were the same, but their arrangement was uniquely modern. The Parliament Buildings also departed from Medieval models by integrating a variety of eras and styles of Gothic architecture, including elements of Gothic architecture from Britain, France, the Low Countries, and Italy all in one building.|$|E

That year, Joe DiMaggio talked about Feller's {{pitching}} ability, stating [...] "I don't think anyone {{is ever going}} to throw a ball faster than he does. And his curveball isn't human." [...] Feller appeared in the May 12, 1941, edition of Life, which said: [...] "...he <b>is</b> <b>unquestionably</b> the idol of several generations of Americans, ranging in age from 7 to 70.

These did not pass unremarked; Hans von Bülow, for example, gave a laudatory review of the Op.35 Études in the Neue Berliner Musikzeitung in 1857, the year in which they were published in Berlin, commenting that [...] "Alkan <b>is</b> <b>unquestionably</b> the most eminent representative of the modern piano school at Paris.

500|$|Charles Rosen, who unraveled {{this unique}} {{borrowing}} of a Beethovenian structure in Schubert's A major Sonata, has {{also referred to}} Schubert's departure from the former's style in this instance: [...] "Schubert moves with great ease within the form which Beethoven created. He has, however, considerably loosened what held it together, and stretched its ligaments unmercifully... the correspondence of part to whole has been considerably altered by Schubert, and explains why his large movements often seem so long, since they are being produced with forms originally intended for shorter pieces. Some of the excitement naturally goes out of these forms when they are so extended, but this is even a condition of the unforced melodic flow of Schubert's music". Rosen adds, however, that [...] "with the finale of the A major Sonata Schubert produced a work that <b>is</b> <b>unquestionably</b> greater than its model".|$|E

[...] Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times called the song [...] "catchy [...] makes you want to grab some glow sticks and hit the clubs" [...] and added that the Femme Fatale era [...] "already shows an undeniably more confident Spears." [...] Mike Collett-White of Reuters deemed it as a dance anthem. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said that the song <b>is</b> <b>unquestionably</b> a Dr. Luke production, but [...] "somehow it's Brit that manages to come out on top."

500|$|In 1976 Hordern {{joined the}} RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he {{appeared}} as Prospero for Trevor Nunn in The Tempest, an engagement which the actor {{found to be}} unpleasant because of his poor relationship with the show's director, Clifford Williams. After that came a short run of Love's Labour's Lost in which he played Don Adriano de Armado opposite Alan Rickman and Zoë Wanamaker. Hordern was the oldest member {{of the company and}} found it difficult to adjust to the behaviour and attitudes of some of the younger and less experienced actors. He found it different from the 1950s: non-intimate, characterless, and lacking in morale because management preferred discipline rather than offering guidance and assistance to their young actors. Writing in his 1993 biography, Hordern wrote: [...] "Being at Stratford again after all these years was rather like being on a battleship or an aircraft carrier that doesn't often come into harbour. You are at sea for long periods and away from the rest of your service and if the captain of your ship is a good one then the ship is happy; if not, then the commission you serve is very unhappy because you are a long way from land. At Stratford that season I was a long way from land." [...] Later, in 1976, Hordern portrayed the kingly father of the Prince (played by Richard Chamberlain) in the musical film adaptation of Cinderella, The Slipper and the Rose, and returned to the role of George in Stoppard's Jumpers at the Lyttelton Theatre. The theatre critic Kenneth Hurren [...] "enjoyed it immoderately" [...] and thought the revival revealed a [...] "tidier play than it look". Hordern compared it to the 1972 version by saying: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>unquestionably</b> a busy little number, and my first impression of the piece, back in 1972, was that it had more decoration than substance, and that the decoration was more chaotic than coherent." ...|$|E
500|$|Elgar's biographer Basil Maine commented, [...] "When Sir Arthur Sullivan died in 1900 {{it became}} {{apparent}} to many that Elgar, although a composer of another build, was his true successor as first musician of the land." [...] Elgar's next major work was eagerly awaited. For the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival of 1900, he set Cardinal John Henry Newman's poem The Dream of Gerontius for soloists, chorus and orchestra. Richter conducted the premiere, which was marred by a poorly prepared chorus, which sang badly. Critics recognised the mastery of the piece despite the defects in performance. It was performed in Düsseldorf, Germany, in 1901 and again in 1902, conducted by Julius Buths, who also conducted the European premiere of the Enigma Variations in 1901. The German press was enthusiastic. The Cologne Gazette said, [...] "In both parts we meet with beauties of imperishable value. ... Elgar stands {{on the shoulders of}} Berlioz, Wagner, and Liszt, from whose influences he has freed himself until he has become an important individuality. He is {{one of the leaders of}} musical art of modern times." [...] The Düsseldorfer Volksblatt wrote, [...] "A memorable and epoch-making first performance! Since the days of Liszt nothing has been produced in the way of oratorio ... which reaches the greatness and importance of this sacred cantata." [...] Richard Strauss, then widely viewed as the leading composer of his day, was so impressed that in Elgar's presence he proposed a toast to the success of [...] "the first English progressive musician, Meister Elgar." [...] Performances in Vienna, Paris and New York followed, and The Dream of Gerontius soon became equally admired in Britain. According to Kennedy, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>unquestionably</b> the greatest British work in the oratorio form ... opened a new chapter in the English choral tradition and liberated it from its Handelian preoccupation." [...] Elgar, as a Roman Catholic, was much moved by Newman's poem about the death and redemption of a sinner, but some influential members of the Anglican establishment disagreed. His colleague, Charles Villiers Stanford complained that the work [...] "stinks of incense". The Dean of Gloucester banned Gerontius from his cathedral in 1901, and at Worcester the following year, the Dean insisted on expurgations before allowing a performance.|$|E
500|$|Poe {{capitalized}} {{on the success}} of [...] "The Raven" [...] by following it up with his essay [...] "The Philosophy of Composition" [...] (1846), in which he detailed the poem's creation. His description of its writing is probably exaggerated, though the essay serves as an important overview of Poe's literary theory. He explains that every component of the poem is based on logic: the raven enters the chamber to avoid a storm (the [...] "midnight dreary" [...] in the [...] "bleak December"), and its perch on a pallid white bust was to create visual contrast against the dark black bird. No aspect of the poem was an accident, he claims, but is based on total control by the author. Even the term [...] "Nevermore", he says, is used because of the effect created by the long vowel sounds (though Poe may have been inspired to use the word by the works of Lord Byron or Henry Wadsworth Longfellow). Poe had experimented with the long o sound throughout many other poems: [...] "no more" [...] in [...] "Silence", [...] "evermore" [...] in [...] "The Conqueror Worm". The topic itself, Poe says, was chosen because [...] "the death... of a beautiful woman <b>is</b> <b>unquestionably</b> the most poetical topic in the world." [...] Told from [...] "the lips... of a bereaved lover" [...] is best suited to achieve the desired effect. Beyond the poetics of it, the lost Lenore may have been inspired by events in Poe's own life as well, either to the early loss of his mother, Eliza Poe, or the long illness endured by his wife, Virginia. Ultimately, Poe considered [...] "The Raven" [...] an experiment to [...] "suit at once the popular and critical taste", accessible to both the mainstream and high literary worlds. It is unknown how long Poe worked on [...] "The Raven"; speculation ranges from a single day to ten years. Poe recited a poem believed to be an early version with an alternate ending of [...] "The Raven" [...] in 1843 in Saratoga, New York. An early draft may have featured an owl.|$|E
