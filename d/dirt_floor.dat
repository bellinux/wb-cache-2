Zamora was their eighth and youngest child. After the birth of their seventh child, Zoraida had been told that she {{would not be able to}} have another, so when Zamora was born feet first on February 29, 1972, leap day leap year, he was regarded as charmed and treated specially by those in his community. Hector had fought in the Cuban Revolution for Fidel Castro, but became disillusioned with the changes brought by communism after Castro came to power. According to Pedro, any mention of Castro in their home would result in a tirade from Hector which earned him a reputation with local informants. As a result, life became difficult for the Zamoras who lived in a small house with a <b>dirt</b> <b>floor.</b> Food was scarce and Zoraida traded on the black market for food.|$|E

25|$|After {{receiving}} her B.A. {{degree from}} Bryn Mawr in 1963, Oughton {{spent the next}} two years in Guatemala with the American Friends Service Committee program (AFSC). Nearly half the women from Oughton's college senior class had gone on to graduate school. Oughton was assigned to Chichicastenango, at that time an isolated Indian market town. Oughton went to Guatemala as a liberal, believing that the problems could be identified and solutions devised and carried out. Eventually, she became a radical, and began to feel an urgency to change everything at once. While there, Oughton worked with young adults and older indigenous people to teach them to read. She helped local Catholic priests implement nutritional programs and edited a left-wing Guatemalan newspaper. Oughton lived in a small house with a <b>dirt</b> <b>floor</b> and a little outhouse. During this time, the questions with which she had struggled with came to a head. Oughton questioned what to do about poverty, social injustice, and revolution in the world. Oughton {{came to the conclusion that}} no matter how many hours were spent working to feed and educate, there would always be more people than jobs to earn wages, inadequate food supplies, and never enough shelter to protect people from the elements.|$|E

The treatment areas were high-density, low-income urban neighborhoods, and eligible households had to have <b>dirt</b> <b>floors</b> and be able prove home ownership prior to participating in the program.

Once Andriamasinavalona's sons had been installed in their territories, Andriantomponimerina tested his authority by imposing a particular hairstyle upon the Marovatana people he ruled, in disregard of the promise that the king had made to respect the diverse customs and taboos of Imerina. The Marovatana reminded the king of this vow and refused to submit, prompting the king and his sons to prepare for war against {{the people of the}} fief. This conflict provided the prince with an opportunity to seize power. Upon the suggestion of the prince's half-brother, Andrianentoarivo, the prince hid himself in a trench he dug into the <b>dirt</b> <b>floor</b> of his royal residence at Ambohidratrimo, then ordered his people to send word to his father that he was [...] "in the ground".

During this time the prince repeatedly offered to free the king on the condition that Andriamasinavalona accept to transfer power to him, which the king repeatedly refused. Andriantomponimerina prevented his brothers from taking action against him by telling their messengers that the king simply preferred his company and had decided to reside with him at Ambohidratrimo.|$|E
