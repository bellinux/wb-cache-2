50|$|Further {{clues to}} the genetic origins of eusociality have been derived by {{comparing}} quality of genomic processes. Also applying to A. mellifera; {{by looking at the}} degree of genetic linkage and chromosomal recombination rates, light may be shed on the consequence of group selection on a eusocial insect colony. Within the Order Hymenoptera, primitively and highly eusocial species tend to have greater <b>gene</b> <b>linkage</b> and significantly higher more DNA recombination events than non-social species. This trend continues within groups of eusocial species, highly eusocial species have highly recombinant genomes. While contested, recombination activity might originate from the influence of group selection acting on developing eusocial organization in haplodiploids, where colonies that can best maintain a stable coefficient of relatedness are favored.|$|E

5000|$|Integration can {{be found}} at the genetic level due to <b>gene</b> <b>linkage.</b> <b>Gene</b> <b>linkage</b> {{involves}} multiple genes being inherited together during meiosis because they are close to each other on the same chromosome. Alleles at different loci can be inherited together if they are tightly linked. Large genetic correlations can only be upheld if the loci that influence different characters are tightly linked, or if high levels of inbreeding in the population occur. Even if selection favors the correlations, it will not be maintained unless those conditions are met. Selection will favor tight linkage because it is maintained better. Poorly linked genetic correlations will not last. [...] Transposition allows the loci at different locations on the chromosome to move so that they can become close to each other and be inherited together. This is significant to understanding the relationship between phenotypic integration and evolution because it is one of the mechanisms of how multiple traits that are connected to each other to evolve and change together. For instance, the Papilio dardanus butterflies come in three different forms, each mimicking a different distasteful butterfly species. [...] Multiple loci contribute to these different forms, and a butterfly with alleles for form A at one locus and B at another locus would have poor fitness. However, the multiple loci are tightly linked, so they are inherited together as a single allele. Through transposition, these multiple loci ended up close to each other. [...] Mutations among these linked genes are the nonadaptive fuel which can create evolution. Evolution may also occur because the integration may have an adaptive advantage in a particular environment for an organism. It is also important to recognize that not only can the traits be inherited together, but inherited separately and selected together. Another important example of phenotypic integration evolving over time is the relationship between the neurocranium and the brain. Over the last 150 million years the number of bones in the brain has decreased while the size of the brain in mammals has changed. Integration between the brain and the skull has evolved over this time period to reduce the number of bones in the cranium, while increasing the size of the brain. This relationship between correlated traits has played an important role in the evolution of mammalian cranium structure and brain size. Finally, development is another crucial cause of phenotypic integration that has evolved over time. Cell-signaling pathways which utilize integration in the form of complex interactions among specific cells in the pathway are crucial to proper development in many organisms. The interactions among the cells in the pathway, and the interaction of the pathways with other pathways have evolved over time to create complex structures.|$|E

40|$|Systematic {{determination}} of gene function {{is an essential}} step in fully understanding the precise contribution of each gene for the proper execution of molecular functions in the cell. <b>Gene</b> functional <b>linkage</b> is defined as to describe the relationship {{of a group of}} genes with similar functions. With thousands of genomes sequenced, there arises a great opportunity to utilize gene evolutionary information to identify <b>gene</b> functional <b>linkages.</b> To this end, we established a computational method (called TRACE) to trace gene footprints through a gene functional network constructed from 341 prokaryotic genomes.

RHA 1 (RHA 1) was predicted and verified experimentally with its deletion mutant showing growth inhibition compared to RHA 1 wild type.
