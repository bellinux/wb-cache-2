40|$|<b>Fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide</b> is an {{acaricide}} {{registered for}} restricted use in agriculture {{on a variety}} of fruits, berries, nuts, Christmas trees, and ornamentals. There are also two non-restricted use products containing <b>fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide</b> and other active ingredients for homeowner use on ornamental trees, shrubs, and flowers. <b>Fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide</b> controls a variety of mites. Fenbutatin-oxide is very highly toxic to fish. It is persistent in the environment and is immobile in soils. Risk quotients exceed criteria of concern by a considerable amount. An endangered species risk assessment is developed for federally listed Pacific salmon and steelhead. This assessment applies the findings of the Reregistration Eligibility Decision developed for non-target fish and wildlife, along with other information, to determine the potential risks to the 26 listed Evolutionarily Significant Units of Pacific salmon and steelhead. The use of <b>fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide</b> may affect 23 of these ESUs, may affect but is not likely to adversely affect 1 ESU, and will not affect 2 ESUs. Contents 1. Background 2.

Studies on {{the test}} method of the {{effectiveness}} of <b>fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide</b> to the citrus red mite, Panonychus citri (McGREGOR) (Acarina: Tetranychidae). Norizumi SHINKAJI and RenpeiHATANO (Faculty of Horticulture, Chiba University, Matsudo, Japan) Tech. Bull. Fac. Hort. Chiba Univ., No. 31 : 93 〜 99. The effectiveness of <b>fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide</b> was tested on various developmental stages of the citrus red mite, Panonychus citri (McGREGOR), by spray and dipping methods. This acaricide is effective to the larval and adult stages, but shows no effect on the egg stage. The most effectiveness is observed against the hatching larval stage. Therefore, it is considered that as one of the advisable test methods the toxicity of the chemical is inspected on the larvae within 24 hours after hatching. In addition, it was discussed on several practical points when operating the test method...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the effects of two insecticides (deltamethrin and acetamiprid), and an acaricide (<b>fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide)</b> on diversity and abundance of mite fauna in replicate experiments carried out in an openeggplant field in Latakia, Syria. Each pesticide was applied three times with an interval of three weeks between two consecutive applications. Two phytophagous mites were observed in all treatments: Tetranychus urticae and olyphagotarsonemus latus. However, the number of predatory mite species (in particular Phytoseiidae) was different according to the pesticide applied and the lowest number observed was in the <b>fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide</b> treatment. This acaricide caused high mortality of T. urticae, decreased the abundance of P. latus, and negatively affected Phytoseiidae. Acetamiprid and deltamethrin induced the resurgences of T. urticae (3. 5 -fold and 1. 5 -fold for the former and the latter respectively). The abundance of P. latus was not affected by acetamiprid but by deltamethrin. The results clarified also that these insecticides seemed harmless to Phytoseiidae [i. e. Phytoseiulus persimilis, Phytoseius finitimus and Typhlodromus (Anthoseius) recki]. Data obtained here are interesting for integrated management programs of the major eggplant phytophagous mites, although the generalization of these results requires some caution and additional experiments are needed...|$|E

40|$|A new, rapid {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic {{method for}} {{the determination of}} <b>fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide</b> has been developed and used to study residue persistence in peaches and nectarines. The pesticide was determined in fruits on an ODS 2 column using methanol/HCl 10 (- 3) M 93 : 7 (v:v) plus NaCl (0. 3 g/L) as the mobile phase, at the flow of 1. 0 mL/min and detected at 205 nm. Under these conditions the detection limit was 0. 05 ppm. Recoveries were 90. 6 - 101. 3 % from peaches and nectarines spiked at 0. 05, 1. 00, and 5 ppm levels' The persistence of fenbutatain oxide residue on field and greenhouse peaches and nectarines was studied.

40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to {{determine}} the residual toxicity of the main pesticides used in citrus, on Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) under laboratory conditions. For this, it was used the residual contact bioassay. Citrus leaves of the variety Pêra were sprayed in a Potter tower. The residual action was evaluated at 2 hours and 1; 3; 5; 7; 10; 14 e 21 days after treatment. Ten adult females of N. californicus were transferred to each ring, together with an enough amount of Tetranychus urticae nymphs and adults to feed the predator. Mortality evaluations were performed at 72 hours after treatment. Bioassays indicate that the pesticides: acrinathrin, deltamethrin, dinocap, sulphur, fenpropathrin, <b>fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide</b> and propargite were innocuous to N. californicus. On the other hand, abamectin, azocyclotin e cyhexatin caused mortalities of 29. 8; 32. 0 e 34. 1 %, respectively, two hours after transference. Dicofol, pyridaben and chlorfenapyr were extremely toxic to the predator mite, causing 100 % of mortality two hours after the application. This way, to this population of N. californicus, the releases can be performed safely 3 days after the application, except for cyhexatin (5 days), dicofol and pyridaben (14 days) and chlorfenapyr (21 days), without risk of significant adult mortality rates due to the application of pesticides...|$|E
40|$|The two-spotted {{spider mite}} Tetranychus urticae Koch is a {{worldwide}} pest, feeding on a large variety of plant families. As its resistance to acaricides spreads rapidly, {{it is crucial to}} develop new biological control tactics to manage its populations. In this respect, essential oils may be a good alternative, as they are currently considered minimumrisk pesticides. In this paper, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments to determine the susceptibility of adult females to 31 essential oils extracted from plants collected from Tunisia and compare it with the results obtained with two synthetic acaricides (spirodiclofen and <b>fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide).</b> Details of the essential oil yield of these plants were also recorded. A maximum yield of 0. 5 % was obtained. Laboratory bioassay indicated that the development of the tetranychid mite population was significantly affected by the use of Deverra scoparia, Haplophyllum tuberculatum, Chrysanthemum coronarium and Mentha pulegium plant extracts that killed 97 %, 93 %, 93 % and 91 % of T. urticae, respectively. The chemical composition of the most effective extracts were characterized by gas chromatography- mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and fast GC-flame ionization detector (FID). The evaluation of the potential of biologically active plant volatiles against T. urticae might provide a new approach to the development of natural acaricides to be used both in biological and integrated pest management strategies for controlling {{two-spotted spider mite}}s. © 2012 Taylor & Francis...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to analyze the}} action of some acaricides, fungicides, {{insecticides}} and herbicides containing different active ingredients on Metarhizium anisopliae Metsch. (Sorokin) inoculated into autoclaved soil. The action of the pesticides was evaluated based on the fungal respiratory activity. The first assessment was done at 48 h after inoculation. The pesticides were then added and respiratory activity was determined nine times every 48 h and an additional five times every 4 days. Except for the fungicides, no significant effect (P > 0. 05) of the pesticides on M. anisopliae was observed. A reduction in CO 2 production was observed for the mancozeb treatment from day 4 to day 6 of incubation, and for tebuconazol between days 4 and 6, 8 and 10, and 32 and 36. The same was observed for copper oxychloride between days 10 and 12 and 32 and 36, and for chlorothalonyl between 8 and 10, 10 and 12, and 32 and 36 days of incubation. Identical effect occurred for the acaricides abamectin and <b>fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide,</b> with a reduction in CO 2 production between 20 and 24 days of incubation. The herbicides glyphosate, trifluralin and ametrin reduced the respiratory activity of the fungus between days 10 and 12, while the insecticide trichlorfon reduced respiratory activity only from 32 to 40 days of incubation. The {{results indicate that the}} toxic action of pesticides on the fungus in soil is small, suggesting that this pest control bioagent can be used in combination with pesticides without compromising its activity...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Reversion of {{resistance}} to the organotin (OT) acaricide cyhexatin was documented for the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae (Koch), by laboratory isolation of a field resistant colony. After 22 generations of no selection the colony reverted back to susceptible. Studies were conducted in 1985 and 1986 on susceptible and resistant T. urticae to test whether relative fitness differences were responsible for OT reversion. Susceptible colonies had significantly shorter developmental times. In addition, a field susceptible strain had a higher female to male sex ratio, and percent survival (egg to adult) than the field resistant strain. These differences are assumed to contribute to reversion in laboratory isolated resistant colonies. The effect of immigration on organotin resistance was also investigated. An immigration (dilution) experiment revealed that dilution {{of resistance}} allowed a moderately resistant colony to revert to susceptible in ca. three generations. In the field several tactics for managing OT resistance were investigated. Formulation differences (i. e. wettable powder verses flowable) of cyhexatin and <b>fenbutatin</b> <b>oxide</b> were found to have an effect on efficacy. In addition cyhexatin efficacy was improved when organotin selection to a population of T. urticae from southern Oregon pear was reduced by substitution of an acaricide to which mites were not cross-resistant. Abamectin (avermectin B 1) was substituted for cyhexatin in 1984 and 1985 in an orchard block harboring resistant mites in 1983. After two years of relaxed selection a standard organotin treatment was reapplied to the abamectin treated block. Better control was achieved with cyhexatin in the abamectin block than in a block that had been continuously treated with cyhexatin over the same two year period. This suggests that reducing selection pressure, by substituting the noncross-resistant compound, allowed resistance to revert in the field. These results suggest a possible mechanism by which organotin resistance in T. urticae may be managed...|$|E

Inicialmente, o experimento foi instalado em um pomar de citros, em que foram selecionadas 10 plantas que continham frutos com verrugose. Realizou-se a aplicação de calda sulfocálcica (8 g i. a. L- 1 de água) em cinco plantas e as outras cinco plantas permaneceram sem aplicação de produto fitossanitário. Protegeram-se, com copos de plástico transparente de 500 mL, 64 frutos nas plantas tratadas com calda e 64 frutos nas plantas não-tratadas, totalizando 128 frutos protegidos. Decorridos 30 dias da aplicação, os frutos foram colhidos e levados para o laboratório. Estes frutos foram parcialmente parafinados, deixando-se em cada fruto uma arena de 2, 5 cm de diâmetro com verrugose e sem parafina, delimitada com cola entomológica. Em seguida, procedeu-se à aplicação sobre os frutos em Torre de Potter dos seguintes acaricidas nas concentrações expressas em mg de ingrediente ativo por litro de água: {{propargite}} a 720 mg, óxido de fenbutatina a 400 mg, cyhexatin a 250 mg, azocyclotin a 250 mg, fenpyroximate a 50 mg, dicofol a 960 mg e dinocap a 738 mg e a testemunha sem aplicação de acaricida.
