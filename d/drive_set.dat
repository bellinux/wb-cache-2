5|$|Strupper {{scored the}} second {{touchdown}} {{on a short}} <b>drive</b> <b>set</b> up by his 40-yard punt return. Early in the second quarter, Strupper shot through the line for 70 yards and the third touchdown. Tech's fourth touchdown required considerable effort and a methodical drive, ending in a 15-yard dive for a touchdown by Strupper. End runs by Guyon and Simpson's line plunging set up the fifth (and final) touchdown with Guyon's 6-yard run. Strupper ran for 198 {{yards and three touchdowns}} on nine carries. Tech's starting lineup was Bell (left end), Fincher (left tackle), Thweatt (left guard), Phillips (center), Dowling (right guard), Rogers (right tackle), Carpenter (right end), Hill (quarterback), Strupper (left halfback), Guyon (right halfback), and Armsley (fullback).|$|E

25|$|After another Vikings punt, Warner led the Rams 62 {{yards in}} eight plays and capped off the drive with a 2-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Williams, increasing St. Louis' lead to 49–17 with just over eight minutes left in regulation. George, who completed only two of eight passes for −9 yards {{in the second half}} until then, responded with three touchdown passes in the final five minutes of the game. His 42-yard completion to Moss on the ensuing <b>drive</b> <b>set</b> up his 4-yard {{touchdown pass to}} Reed. Then Carter recovered an onside kick, and the Vikings scored another touchdown on George's 44-yard pass to Moss. Following a Rams punt, Minnesota drove 85 yards in 16 plays to score on George's 2-yard touchdown toss to Moss, but by then only 35 seconds remained on the clock.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after their}} victory over Vanderbilt {{in the season}} finale, University {{president}} George Denny accepted an invitation {{to play in the}} 1935 Rose Bowl against the Stanford Indians. In the game, which was a rematch of their draw in the 1927 Rose Bowl, the Crimson Tide overwhelmed the Indians with their 29–13 victory before 84,474 fans at Pasadena. The Stanford defense shined in the first quarter, as Alabama had only four yards total offense. The Indians then took a 7–0 lead later in the quarter after Bobby Grayson scored on a short run to complete a <b>drive</b> <b>set</b> up after Keith Topping recovered a Joe Demyanovich fumble. Early in the second, Dixie Howell scored on a five-yard run, but Riley Smith missed the extra point and Stanford still led 7–6.|$|E
25|$|After a Bengals punt, Chandler {{gave the}} Chargers good field {{position}} with a 7-yard {{return to the}} 45-yard line. San Diego then drove 55 yards and cut their deficit to 10–7 when Fouts, desperately trying to avoid a hit from lineman Eddie Edwards, managed to fire a pass to Kellen Winslow {{at the line of}} scrimmage, who subsequently raced 33 yards down the right sideline for a score. But the Bengals stormed right back on a <b>drive</b> <b>set</b> up by David Verser's 40-yard kickoff to the 46-yard line. Faced with third down and 7 inside the red zone later in the drive, Anderson kept the drive going with a 16-yard completion to Isaac Curtis on the Chargers 1-yard line, and fullback Pete Johnson scored a touchdown run on the next play, giving them a 17–7 lead.|$|E

25|$|Cleveland {{lost its}} {{first game of}} the season and was shut {{out for the first time}} in 62 games against the Giants in Cleveland. Unlike the Eagles, the Giants {{prepared}} carefully for the Browns and were able to stop the team's potent passing attack. After the Browns beat Philadelphia, Giants coach Steve Owen scouted the team and resolved to use an innovative umbrella defense, a formation where the defensive ends were used to cover passes. This freed the team's linebackers and safeties to cover passes over the middle of the field. The Giants advanced 52 yards on a drive in the first quarter, ending with a touchdown run by Eddie Price. The extra point attempt failed, but the six points were enough to win the game as New York's defensive strategy paid dividends. Graham had no completions in the first half and threw four interceptions. Cleveland had several opportunities to score late in the game, including a <b>drive</b> <b>set</b> up by a good punt return by Dom Moselle that ended with a fumble. Graham also missed on passes to Speedie and Horace Gillom in the end zone in the fourth quarter.|$|E
25|$|After forcing {{an early}} punt, {{defensive}} back Kiaree Daniels ran into Ball State's Chris Miller, drawing a 15-yard penalty {{to give a}} first down to the Cardinals'. Nate Davis responded by throwing a 33-yard pass to Briggs Orsbon at the Huskies' one-yard line. Two plays later, Miquale Lewis scored for a 7–0 lead. Midway through the second quarter, Davis completed a 33-yard pass to Louis Johnson. Then Davis threw his second touchdown pass to Darius Hill for a 14–0 lead. With 1:53 {{to go in the}} second quarter, Davis threw his third touchdown pass to Daniel Ifft for a 21–0 lead. Northern Illinois' Chandler Harnish opened the second half with a 25-yard touchdown run, but Lewis' 64yard run on the ensuing <b>drive</b> <b>set</b> up a Davis one-yard touchdown run. Then, after a replay review reversed a 71-yard touchdown pass from Davis to Johnson, Davis went right back to Johnson for a 22-yard touchdown. Davis finished his night with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Hill early in the fourth quarter that made it 45–7. Davis completed 18 passes out of 22 for 300yards and broke Mike Neu's career record for completions. Lewis ran 19 times and reached the 1,000yard mark for the season, while Johnson caught six passes for 165yards and a touchdown. Northern Illinois allowed nearly six times its per game average of 8.2 points. The Cardinals moved up two spots to #14 in the Associated Press poll, two spots in the USA Today coaches poll to #16, and three spots to #14 in the BCS poll after the victory over the Huskies.|$|E

[...] Darick Holmes' 34-yard run then moved {{the ball to the}} Dolphins 1, but that was as far as the drive would go, as defensive back Gene Atkins intercepted Kelly's pass in the end zone on the first play of the second quarter.|$|E

2500|$|Riding high {{from their}} Monday Night {{win over the}} Vikings, the Patriots {{returned}} home for a highly anticipated Sunday Night matchup with the Indianapolis Colts. In the first quarter, the Colts drew first blood as quarterback Peyton Manning completed a five-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marvin Harrison for the only score of the quarter. In the second quarter, Dillon helped the Patriots respond with a one-yard touchdown run. Indianapolis would re-take the lead on a one-yard touchdown run by rookie running back Joseph Addai. Dillon again tied the game, this time on a four-yard touchdown run. Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri then nailed a 23-yard field goal to give the Colts a lead they would not relinquish. In the third quarter, the duo of Manning and Harrison struck again with a four-yard touchdown strike. The Patriots responded with a 49-yard field goal, Gostkowski's career longest to date. In the fourth quarter, Vinatieri kicked a 31-yard field goal to make the score 27–17. On the Patriots next possession they drove down the field but ended up going 3-and-out in the red zone and settled for a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal. On the Colts' ensuing drive, a <b>drive</b> <b>set</b> up a Vinatieri field goal attempt but the former Patriots kicker missed this one to give his former team a chance to tie it up and send the game into overtime. However, the Patriots comeback attempt was thwarted when a Brady pass deflected off the hands of Faulk and was intercepted by Cato June. With the loss, the Patriots dropped to 6–2. As part of his 5-catch effort in the game, Troy Brown became the Patriots' all-time leader in receptions. (Stanley Morgan, 534) ...|$|E

They were shadows, as it were, that had to be reckoned with, but they never became part of himself. And it came upon him now with a certain shock of surprise to notice Lucy. He felt suddenly a new interest in her. He seemed to see her for the first time, and her rare beauty strangely moved him. In her serge dress and her gauntlets, with a motor cap and a flowing veil, a stick in her hand, she seemed on a sudden to express the country through which for {{the last two or three}} days he had wandered.
