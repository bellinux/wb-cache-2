Nowadays, this management change towards workers´ wellbeing is highlighted as an important issue. The aims of this paper are to adapt to Spanish speakers the Servant Leadership Survey (SLS) by van Dierendonck and Nuijten (2011), and to analyze its factorial validity through confirmatory factor analysis and measurement invariance in three countries. A sample of 638 working people from three Spanish-speaking countries (Spain, Argentina and Mexico) participated in the study. In all three countries, confirmatory factor analyses corroborate the eight factor structure (empowerment, accountability, standing back, humility, authenticity, courage, forgiveness and stewardship) with one second order factor (servant leadership) (in all three samples, CFI, IFI >. 92, TLI >. 91, RMSEA <. 70).

This thesis is organized into three chapters. In Chapter 1 {{the introduction of}} the boundary in the non-abelian CS model is illustrated. The purpose of this chapter is to describe some techniques known in literature, which are largely used in the following chapters. In Chapter 2 the three-dimensional non-abelian BF theory with a boundary is analyzed. The most interesting result of this chapter is the interpretation of the boundary term of the Ward Identities as the gauge-fixing for the <b>residual</b> gauge <b>invariance</b> of the theory on the boundary. In Chapter 3 the techniques developed in the previous chapters are applied to the abelian BF theory in four space-time dimensions with a boundary.

Results indicated that (a) {{it is appropriate to}} model the MRNI-SF using either a bifactor or unidimensional model but not a second-order model, (b) the raw MRNI-SF total score is a suitable measure of the general TMI construct, (c) the raw self-reliance through mechanical skills and negativity toward sexual minorities subscale scores may be appropriate measures of their respective specific factors (akin to subscale factors), and (d) SEM or ipsatizing procedures should be used to model the 5 other specific factors, given the insufficient model-based reliability of their raw subscale scores.

Methods: A clinically referred sample of 408 parent-youth dyads (M age youth = 14. 33, SD = 1. 89; 53. 7 % male; 50. 0 % Non-Hispanic White (NHW), 14. 0 % Hispanic, 29. 7 % African-American) completed the SCARED. We examined (a) differences between parents and youth in {{the total number of}} symptoms reported (difference scores) and in their ratings of specific symptoms (q correlations), (b) demographic factors associated with these indices, and (c) equivalence of the pattern and magnitude of factor loadings (i. e., configural and metric invariance), as well as item thresholds and residual variances, across informants. Results: The mean difference score was 2. 13 (SD = 14. 44), with youth reporting higher levels of symptoms, and the mean q correlation was. 32 (SD =. 24). Difference scores were greater for African-American dyads than NHW pairs. We found complete configural, metric, and <b>residual</b> <b>invariance,</b> and partial threshold invariance.

The SCARED was invariant across informant reports, suggesting that it is appropriate to compare mean scores for these raters and that variability in parent and youth report is not attributable to their rating different constructs or using different thresholds to determine when symptoms are present.

Several measurement model fit indices were examined, including change in the comparative fit index (Delta CFI), to evaluate four increasingly restrictive hypotheses of configural, metric, scalar, and <b>residual</b> <b>invariance.</b> All levels of invariance by age, walking limitations, and neighborhood walking were supported (Delta CFI less than -. 01).
