5|$|Finding himself totally {{alone in}} a {{shattered}} world with food to last him a lifetime but no one to share it with, Bemis succumbs to despair. As he prepares to commit suicide using a revolver he has found, Bemis sees {{the ruins of the}} public library in the distance. Investigating, he finds that the books are still intact and readable; all the books he could <b>ever</b> <b>hope</b> for are his for the reading, and (as he gazes upon a huge fallen face of a clock) learns that he has {{all the time in the}} world to read them without interruption.|$|E

500|$|The Fifth Element polarised critics on release. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times {{described}} {{the film as}} an [...] "elaborate, even campy sci-fi extravaganza, which is nearly as hard to follow as last year's [...]" [...] He concluded that The Fifth Element was [...] "a lot warmer, more fun and boasts {{some of the most}} sophisticated, witty production and costume design you could <b>ever</b> <b>hope</b> to see." [...] On film review show At the Movies, both Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "thumbs up"; in his own review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, calling it [...] "One of the great goofy movies", and concluding, [...] "I would not have missed seeing this film, and I recommend it for its richness of imagery. But at 127 minutes, which seems a reasonable length, it plays long." ...|$|E

60|$|Then {{is the man}} fit {{indeed to}} come to church, sins and all:- if he carry his sins into church not to carry them out again safely and carefully, as we are all too apt to do, but to cast them down {{at the foot of}} Christ's cross, in the hope (and no man <b>ever</b> <b>hoped</b> that hope in vain)--that he will be {{lightened}} of that burden, and leave some of them at least behind him. Ay, no man, I say, <b>ever</b> <b>hoped</b> that in vain. No man ever yet felt the burden of his sins really intolerable and unbearable, but what the burden of his sins was taken off him before all was over, and Christ's righteousness given to him instead.|$|R

500|$|In {{the early}} years of The Simpsons, Homer Simpson {{generally}} loathed Ned, because Ned's family, job, health and self-discipline are of higher quality than he could <b>ever</b> <b>hope</b> to attain himself. Homer is often shown [...] "borrowing" [...] (stealing) items from Flanders, such as a weather vane, a camcorder, a diploma, a toothbrush and an air conditioning unit. Even the Simpsons' couch came from [...] "the curb outside Flanders' house". Homer has since come to have a love-hate relationship with Ned, sometimes being his best friend, partly due to Ned's selfless tolerance of him, and other times treating Ned with complete disregard. Homer seems to genuinely care for Ned, despite still expressing and often acting on feelings of loathing. Nowadays Homer seems to regard Ned as more of a nuisance. An early running joke was that Marge considers Flanders to be a perfect neighbor and usually sides with him instead of her husband, which always enrages Homer. Flanders is normally oblivious to Homer's disdain for him.|$|E
500|$|Indiewire's Max O'Connell criticised the church's {{approach}} for being counterproductive. He predicted that [...] "their {{campaign against the}} film {{is going to be}} the best publicity that Alex Gibney and company could <b>ever</b> <b>hope</b> for, if also a hassle for critics and filmmakers and (this is no small thing) a nightmare for the ex-CoS members who dared to speak out against the Church's practices. But then, they don't seem terribly aware that attacking everyone who criticizes you doesn't do a lot of good for your image." [...] Paul Haggis, who was labeled [...] "doughy" [...] and [...] "pasty" [...] by the church, likewise felt that the attacks were backfiring: [...] "You don't think that makes you look really bad trying to slander me in that way? I'm an imperfect human being. And I've made many, many mistakes in my life. So you can absolutely publicize any of those. But this, really, (you’re) thinking that makes you look good?" ...|$|E
500|$|Although natural wonders are {{celebrated in}} the Psalms and the Book of Job, {{wilderness}} portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially {{in the works of}} the Romantic movement. British artists John Constable and J. M. W. Turner turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. William Wordsworth's poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture. This artistic movement also coincided with the Transcendentalist movement in the Western world. A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word mimesis, the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical forms and more generally by patterns in nature. As David Rothenburg writes, [...] "The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can <b>ever</b> <b>hope</b> to see".|$|E

500|$|In 2009, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences {{announced}} {{the retirement of}} the award category. President and CEO Neil Portnow stated that the Academy needed {{to do so in}} order to remain a [...] "relevant and responsive" [...] organization within a [...] "dynamic music community". Polka musicians and fans were disappointed with the category elimination. Three-time award winner Walter Ostanek admitted he [...] " [...] sorry for the future artists" [...] that would fail to be recognized by the Academy. Carl Finch of the group Brave Combo stated the following: [...] "Having a polka category was the most important step to legitimacy that we could <b>ever</b> <b>hope</b> to achieve. To have that taken away, it's like it was all for nothing." [...] Apart from ensuring that the [...] "awards process remains representative of the current musical landscape", the Academy cited dwindling competition as one reason for the category retirement. Others speculated that Jimmy Sturr's eighteen wins led to the elimination. Due to the elimination of a polka-specific category, polka musicians are likely to submit recordings in the folk and world music categories.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{was again}} praised by Wisden {{in its report}} on the 1948 tour. [...] "Indebtedness for the smooth running of the tour and general harmony of the team was due largely to the manager, Mr Keith Johnson, {{hard-working}} and always genial," [...] it said. [...] "Paying tribute to the loyalty of the players, Mr Johnson said {{there had not been}} a discordant note in the party throughout the tour." [...] Flanagan labelled Johnson as [...] "conscientious, reserved, dignified, extraordinarily industrious and scrupulously trustworthy". He {{went on to say that}} [...] "No organization, no body corporate, no individual could <b>ever</b> <b>hope</b> to have a more loyal, a more devoted, or a more conscientious officer...Although to the world in general all the praise and glory for the unequalled triumph the tour proved to be goes to Sir Donald Bradman, only those who travelled with the team will ever have a proper conception of the part played in that triumph by Keith Johnson." [...] Bradman said that Johnson [...] "created friends and goodwill everywhere both for himself and the team, and no side could have wished for a better Manager". On the journey back to Australia, the players presented Johnson with a silver Georgian salver, with their signatures engraved on the memento.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers also {{praised the}} game's varied {{scenarios}} and replayability. Dora from Jay Is Games praised the game, saying that [...] "with {{a huge amount}} of replay value, creativity to burn, and some of the most shocking plot lines you could <b>ever</b> <b>hope</b> to encounter, Hatoful Boyfriend is a fascinating and surprising text adventure well worth checking out", though she also observes that [...] "the delayed payoff and the abruptness of some of the endings combined with the oddball concept may not appeal to every fan of the visual novel genre". Alexa Ray Corriea's Polygon review of the remake gave it an 8 out of 10, concluding that the [...] "witty dialogue and absolutely bonkers scenarios are genuinely fun to discover, and the handful of different storylines make repeated playthroughs worthwhile". Some critics however expressed concerns over the presence of some repetitive aspects of gameplay—noted as being especially apparent when attempting multiple playthroughs—as well as the accessibility of the game's Bad Boys Love scenario to casual players: in his review of the remake for PC Gamer, Julian Murdoch states that [...] "I suspect few will have the patience to ride the fast forward button and suss out the romantic proclivities of each cast member to get to the extended ending—really a second half—of the game".|$|E

500|$|McKinley {{was elected}} {{governor}} in November 1891, and the Republicans took {{a two-thirds majority}} in the legislature. [...] During the campaign, supporters of both Foraker and Sherman had sought pledges from candidates, and {{in the aftermath of}} the legislative elections, both men expressed confidence. Sherman was handicapped by his age (68), unpopularity, and a cold personality; according to Horner, [...] "Foraker was simply more of a man of the people than Sherman could <b>ever</b> <b>hope</b> to be." [...] Sherman's aide, Jacob C. Donaldson, later wrote, [...] "the situation was bad, almost desperate". [...] Hanna had made significant campaign contributions to legislative candidates, and was outraged when legislators believed to favor Sherman instead announced that they would vote for Foraker; according to his biographer, Herbert Croly, [...] "The situation looked desperate; but it was saved, so Mr. Sherman himself stated to his friends, by Mr. Hanna's energy, enthusiasm and ability to bend other men to his will. Three of the Cleveland representatives, who had gone into hiding, were unearthed and forced into line." [...] Donaldson noted, [...] "Several of them were ruined by their perfidy." [...] Foraker was defeated narrowly in the Republican caucus, first on a vote to hold a secret ballot (which would have benefited him), and then on the endorsement vote, which supported Sherman, who was subsequently elected by the legislature. [...] According to Horner, [...] "It is difficult to know which mattered more to Hanna—making sure his old friend Sherman kept his job or making sure that Foraker did not get it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Thirteenth Sonata, the [...] "Minacciosa" [...] ("menacing") in F minor, Op. 53, No. 2, {{is another}} one-movement work. It is highly chromatic, and {{contains}} a fugue.

Bahá'u'lláh stated that the soul not only {{continues}} to live after the physical death of the human body, but is, in fact, immortal. Heaven can be seen partly as the soul's state of nearness to God; and hell as a state of remoteness from God. Each state follows as a natural consequence of individual efforts, or the lack thereof, to develop spiritually. Bahá'u'lláh taught that individuals have no existence prior to their life here on earth and the soul's evolution is always towards God and away from the material world.|$|E
