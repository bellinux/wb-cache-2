5|$|<b>Ethnic</b> <b>tension</b> {{continued}} to grow shortly after Mahathir narrowly defeated Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah for the UMNO Presidency in 1987. Around this time, several deposit-taking co-operatives (DTCs), some associated with the MCA, collapsed. To save Chinese investors, the MCA asked the government to bail out the DTCs, citing a previous bailout of Bumiputra financial institutions. UMNO's reluctance to acquiesce led MCA Deputy President Lee Kim Sai to warn that the MCA might quit the government. Later that year, the government posted several non-Chinese-educated staff to senior positions in Chinese vernacular schools. Anwar Ibrahim, then Education Minister, refused to yield to protests from the MCA, and stated that the decision was final, despite a previous informal agreement on the issue between the Malay and Chinese communities.|$|E
5|$|The sociopolitical {{atmosphere}} of Chicago {{was one of}} <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension</b> caused by competition among many new groups. With the Great Migration, thousands of African Americans from the South had settled next to neighborhoods of European immigrants on Chicago's South Side, near jobs in the stockyards and meatpacking plants. The Irish had been established first, and fiercely defended their territory and political power against all newcomers. Post World War I tensions caused frictions between the races, especially in the competitive labor and housing markets. Overcrowding and increased African American militancy by veterans contributed to the visible racial frictions. Also, a combination of ethnic gangs and police neglect strained the racial relationships. According to official reports, the turmoil came to a boil {{after the death of}} an African American youth who had accidentally drifted into a swimming area at an informally segregated beach. Tensions between groups arose in a melee that blew up into days of unrest.|$|E

40|$|<b>Ethnic</b> <b>tensions</b> may {{restrict}} {{economic growth}} {{through a number}} of infrastructure channels. We extend this literature by (1) using a broad measure of <b>ethnic</b> <b>tensions,</b> (2) considering a variety of measures of social infrastructure for a panel of 87 countries across 16 years and (3) explicitly addressing the endogeneity of <b>ethnic</b> <b>tensions.</b> We find <b>ethnic</b> <b>tensions</b> significantly retard the formation of social infrastructure and, by extension, impose an unnecessary cap on growth and development. As such, governments would well-serve the interests of their populaces by enacting policies, conducting politics and carrying out their daily functions in ways that serve to dampen <b>ethnic</b> <b>tensions,</b> rather than the reverse, which too often seems the case. ...|$|R

Economic freedoms, on the other hand, robustly reduce the number of terrorist attacks originating in ethnically tense societies. <b>Ethnic</b> <b>tensions,</b> Transnational terrorism, Political rights, Economic rights, Cold War,...|$|R
25|$|In theory, {{this leads}} to self {{governance}} and protection for the ethnic group.

Switzerland is often characterized as a successful consociationalist state.|$|E
25|$|The Kyrgyz Revolution of 2010, {{also known}} as the Second Kyrgyz Revolution, began in April 2010 with the ousting of Kyrgyz {{president}} Kurmanbek Bakiyev in the capital Bishkek.

25|$|Although Mali {{has enjoyed}} a {{reasonably}} good inter-ethnic relationships based on {{the long history of}} coexistence, some hereditary servitude and bondage relationship exist, as well as <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension</b> between settled Songhai and nomadic Tuaregs of the north. Due to a backlash against the northern population after independence, Mali is now in a situation where both groups complain about discrimination {{on the part of the}} other group. This conflict also plays a role in the continuing Northern Mali conflict where there is a tension between both Tuaregs and the Malian government, and the Tuaregs and radical Islamists who are trying to establish sharia law.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{collapse}} of the USSR, most immigrants have come from Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine, Moldova, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. This has resulted in <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension.</b> Every year, 300,000 immigrants arrive in Russia, of which over 75% are Russian speakers. In the 1990s, immigration was the main reason Russia did not suffer substantial population decline. It reached a peak for this era at 1,200,000 in 1994 with a mass influx of mostly Russian speakers from ex-Soviet states fleeing for social, economic or political reasons such as the civil war in Tajikistan from 1992 to 1997. In 2014, immigration rose to 2.2 million, 89% of whom were fleeing the conflict in neighbouring Ukraine; in 2015, immigration exceeded 3 million with most coming from the same source.|$|E
25|$|Philo {{lived in}} an era of {{increasing}} <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension</b> in Alexandria, exacerbated by the new strictures of imperial rule. Some expatriate Hellenes in Alexandria condemned the Jews for a supposed alliance with Rome, even as Rome was seeking to suppress Jewish nationalism in Judea. In Against Flaccus, Philo describes the situation of the Jews in Egypt, writing that they numbered not less than a million and inhabited two of the five districts in Alexandria. He recounts the abuses of the prefect Flaccus, who he says retaliated against the Jews when they refused to worship Caligula as a god. Daniel Schwartz surmises that given this tense background it may have been politically convenient for Philo to favor abstract monotheism instead of overt pro-Judeanism.|$|E
25|$|However, in cities, {{where the}} {{population}} {{tends to be}} much higher, informal interactions between ethnic groups might {{not be sufficient to}} prevent violence. This is because you need many more links to connect everyone and therefore it is much more difficult to form and strengthen inter-ethnic ties. In cities, formal inter-ethnic associations like trade unions, business associations and professional organizations are more effective in encouraging inter-ethnic interactions that could prevent ethnic violence in the future. These organizations force ethnic groups to come together based on shared economic interests that overcomes any pre-existing ethnic differences. For example, inter-ethnic business organizations serve to connect the business interests of different ethnic groups which would increase their desire to maintain ethnic harmony. Any <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension</b> or outbreak of violence will go against their economic interests and therefore, over time, the salience of ethnic identity diminishes.|$|E
40|$|In a post-conflict context, {{reconciliation}} {{takes place}} between the opposite forces, and when an ethnic conflict has occurred; reconciliation takes {{place between the}} opposed ethnic groups. Thus reconciliation {{is part of a}} process of decreasing <b>ethnic</b> <b>tensions,</b> but not the only important aspect. Rwanda is a least-likely case for declined <b>ethnic</b> <b>tensions,</b> due to the brutal genocide in 1994. Two aspects of reconciliation are examined: jurisdiction and political influence. Gacaca and the ICTR illustrate jurisdiction and representation and political history writing exemplify political impact. Results of the study implies that gacaca could cause increased <b>ethnic</b> <b>tensions</b> in a short perspective, but discovering the truth is crucial for lessened <b>ethnic</b> <b>tensions</b> in a long perspective. Moreover, results suggest that a difficult issue for ICTR’s success is that the institution is not visible in every-day life.

25|$|A recent {{theory of}} <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension</b> {{resolution}} is non-territorial autonomy or NTA. NTA {{has emerged in}} recent years as an alternative solution to ethnic tensions and grievances in places that are likely to breed conflict. For this reason, NTA has been promoted as a more practical and state building solution than consociationalism. NTA, alternatively known as non-cultural autonomy (NCA), is based on the difference of jus solis and jus sanguinis, the principles of territory versus that of personhood. It gives rights to ethnic groups to self-rule and govern matters potentially concerning but limited to: education, language, culture, internal affairs, religion, and the internally established institutions needed to promote and reproduce these facets. In contrast to federalism, the ethnic groups are not assigned a titular sub-state, but rather the ethnic groups are dispersed throughout the state unit. Their group rights and autonomy are not constrained to a particular territory within the state. This is done in order not to weaken the center state such {{as in the case of}} ethnofederalism.|$|E
500|$|In the meantime, Tamil {{political}} opinion started shifting as {{a result}} of the government's perceived apathy and the Prime Minister's apparent inability to recognise the consequences of the growing <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension</b> in the country. At its 12th annual convention in Mallakam in September 1973 ITAK passed a resolution seeking self-determination for Tamils. Tamils now established their claim to be a sovereign nation-state and Chelvanayakam was considered the father of the nation. For his part Chelvanayakam ingrained the concept of a [...] "traditional homeland for the Tamil people" [...] in the mindset of the Tamils. Violence between Tamil militant youth and the government also escalated.|$|E

2500|$|The {{usage of}} the term [...] "wage slavery" [...] shifted to [...] "wage work" [...] {{at the end of}} the 19th century as groups like the Knights of Labor and American Federation of Labor shifted to a more reformist, trade union {{ideology}} instead of worker's self-management. Much of the decline was caused by the rapid increase in manufacturing after the industrial revolution and the subsequent dominance of wage labor as a result.

2500|$|According to the 2001 Census, {{there are}} about 40,620 Yazidis in Armenia. According to a 2007 U.S. Department of State human rights report, [...] "As in {{previous}} years, Yezidi leaders did not complain that police and local authorities subjected their community to discrimination". A high percentage of Yezidi children do not attend school, both due to poverty {{and a lack of}} teachers who speak their native language. However, the first ever Yezidi school opened in Armenia in 1920. Due to the <b>ethnic</b> <b>tension</b> created by the war with Azerbaijan, the Yazidi community has renounced its ties with the mostly Muslim Kurds that fled the country and tried to establish itself as a distinct ethnic group.
