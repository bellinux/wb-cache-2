5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the reflected wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} <b>incident</b> <b>wave,</b> as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the <b>incident</b> <b>wave</b> and the amplitude of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the <b>incident</b> <b>wave</b> has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears to be standing still on the line and is called a standing wave.|$|E

Fig.6 illustrates the Fizeau, Mach–Zehnder and Fabry–Pérot interferometers. Other examples of amplitude splitting interferometer include the Michelson, Twyman–Green, Laser Unequal Path, and Linnik interferometer.|$|E

40|$|The {{absorption}} {{efficiency of}} a coherent perfect absorber usually depends on the phase coherence of the <b>incident</b> <b>waves</b> on the surfaces. Here, we present a scheme to create a multi-channel coherent perfect absorber in which the constraint of phase coherence is loosened. The scheme has a multi-layer structure such that <b>incident</b> <b>waves</b> in different channels with different angular momenta can be simultaneously and perfectly absorbed. This absorber is robust in achieving high absorption efficiency even if the <b>incident</b> <b>waves</b> become "incoherent" and possess "random" wave fronts. Our work demonstrates a unique approach to designing highly efficient metamaterial absorbers. © CopyrightEPLA, 2016...|$|R

25|$|If {{the axis}} of {{polarization}} of the <b>incident</b> <b>wave</b> is chosen so that it makes a 0° with the fast or slow axes of the waveplate, then the polarization will not change, so remains linear. If the angle is in between 0° and 45° the resulting wave has an elliptical polarization.|$|E
25|$|The term {{dynamical}} {{stems from}} the studies of X-ray diffraction and describes the situation where {{the response of the}} crystal to an <b>incident</b> <b>wave</b> is included self-consistently and multiple scattering can occur. The aim of any dynamical LEED theory is to calculate the intensities of diffraction of an electron beam impinging on a surface as accurately as possible.|$|E
25|$|When {{the light}} propagates either along or {{orthogonal}} to the optic axis, such a lateral shift does not occur. In the first case, both polarizations {{see the same}} effective refractive index, {{so there is no}} extraordinary ray. In the second case the extraordinary ray propagates at a different phase velocity (corresponding to ne) but is not an inhomogeneous wave. A crystal with its optic axis in this orientation, parallel to the optical surface, may be used to create a waveplate, {{in which there is no}} distortion of the image but an intentional modification of the state of polarization of the <b>incident</b> <b>wave.</b> For instance, a quarter-wave plate is commonly used to create circular polarization from a linearly polarized source.|$|E
40|$|In {{a series}} of works already completed, the {{theories}} on a long wave in an L-shaped canal have been developed under the first, second and third approximations. In the present work, these theories are utilized to calculate the wave heights and phases for a canal of uniform width and for discussing the behaviors of the waves in the canal in question. Then the following facts are ascertained: - When kd(k: a wave number of the <b>incident</b> <b>waves,</b> d: a width of the canal) increases, the wave height of the reflected waves is linearly augmented from zero to amount to about 20 percent of that of the <b>incident</b> <b>waves</b> at kd= 1. 0. Then the advancing waves diminish monotonically in height to reach about 95 percent of the incident waves(if these values are evaluated in energy, the reflected waves for the range kd < 1. 0 are at most 5 percent of the <b>incident</b> <b>waves</b> and the advancing waves are propagated nearly without loss of energy). As far as the phases are concerned, when kd is small, the reflected waves have a phase difference of π/ 2 from the <b>incident</b> <b>waves.</b> As kd increases, such a difference decreases linearly until the value reaches zero at kd■l. 5. In other words, the <b>incident</b> and reflected <b>waves</b> make up quasi-standing waves, instead of complete standing waves, under the condition λ■ 4 d (λ: a wavelength of the <b>incident</b> <b>waves).</b> 今までおこなわれてきた一連の研究で,筆者はL字水防における長波の理論を第 1,第 2,第 3 近似までの範囲で展開を試みた. 本報告では,これらの理論を用い,水路の幅が不変なモデルについて数値解析をおこない,L字水路における長波の状態を調べた. そしてつぎのようなことを知つた.

25|$|Shielding {{effectiveness}} {{depends on}} the frequency being used. Low-frequency LowFID tags, like those used in implantable devices for humans and pets, are relatively resistant to shielding though thick metal foil will prevent most reads. High frequency HighFID tags (13.56MHz—smart cards and access badges) are sensitive to shielding and are difficult to read when within a few centimetres of a metal surface. UHF Ultra-HighFID tags (pallets and cartons) are difficult to read when placed within a few millimetres of a metal surface, although their read range is actually increased when they are spaced 2–4cm from a metal surface due to positive reinforcement of the reflected wave and the <b>incident</b> <b>wave</b> at the tag.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} factor in {{the sound of a}} loudspeaker system is the amount of absorption and diffusion present in the environment. Clapping one's hands in a typical empty room, without draperies or carpet, produces a zippy, fluttery echo due both to a lack of absorption and to reverberation (that is, repeated echoes) from flat reflective walls, floor, and ceiling. The addition of hard surfaced furniture, wall hangings, shelving and even baroque plaster ceiling decoration changes the echoes, primarily because of diffusion caused by reflective objects with shapes and surfaces having sizes on the order of the sound wavelengths. This somewhat breaks up the simple reflections otherwise caused by bare flat surfaces, and spreads the reflected energy of an <b>incident</b> <b>wave</b> over a larger angle on reflection.|$|E
25|$|A {{general state}} of {{polarization}} launched into the medium {{can always be}} decomposed into two waves, one {{in each of those}} two polarizations, which will then propagate with different wavenumbers |k|. Applying the different phase of propagation to those two waves over a specified propagation distance will result in a generally different net polarization state at that point; this is the principle of the waveplate for instance. However, when you have a wave launched into a birefringent material at non-normal incidence, the problem is yet more complicated since the two polarization components will now not only have distinct wavenumbers but the k vectors will not even be in exactly the same direction (see figure {{at the top of the}} page). In this case the two k vectors are rather solutions of eqn. 6 constrained by the boundary condition which requires that the components of the two transmitted waves' k vectors, and the k vector of the <b>incident</b> <b>wave,</b> as projected onto the surface of the interface must all be identical.|$|E

The wave forces on any cylinder in the array is seen to generally increase with the inclusion of additional downstream cylinders in both cases. The wave forces on the downstream cylinders also reduce {{along the length of}} the array and the most downstream cylinder experiences the least forces in the array.
