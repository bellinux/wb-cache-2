50|$|The {{painting}} {{was acquired by}} Irish businessman John Magnier. He was refused an <b>export</b> <b>licence</b> (see Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art) while the Tate Gallery sought funding to make an offer to acquire the work. An anonymous donation allowed the gallery to make an offer of £12.5 million, but Magnier refused to sell, {{and in the meantime}} he refused to allow the painting to be displayed in public in the UK. The British government refused a permanent <b>export</b> <b>licence,</b> but a temporary <b>export</b> <b>licence</b> was granted in 2005 for 6½ years, and the painting went on display at the National Gallery of Ireland. It was included in the Reynolds exhibition at Tate Britain in 2005. In 2012, an application for a second temporary <b>export</b> <b>licence</b> was refused, and the painting returned to the UK.|$|R
50|$|In March 2009, Cargill Australia (Wagga) had its <b>export</b> <b>licence,</b> to <b>export</b> meat to Japan and the United States, {{placed on}} {{temporary}} suspension by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) after E. coli was detected in Cargill's export containers from its Wagga Wagga plant.

5000|$|On 28 April, the Harper {{government}} announced further economic sanctions on nine additional Russians and two Russian banks amid escalating tensions over Ukraine.

This was done {{in concert with the}} US, which imposed escalating sanctions of its own, including <b>export</b> <b>licence</b> applications for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities. The US Commerce and State Departments revoked any existing <b>export</b> <b>licences</b> that meet these conditions. [...] Tit-for-tat economic sanctions had begun in March 2014.|$|R

40|$|The Australian Meat Board (AMB) can {{influence}} the quantities sent to and the prices received for Australian beef and veal in the domestic and various export markets. Through its power to grant <b>export</b> <b>licences</b> and the conditions to be met in obtaining <b>export</b> <b>licences</b> the AMB can adopt {{the role of a}} price discriminating monopolist without supply control. This paper evaluates the price, quantity, efficiency and distribution effects of the export diversification scheme introduced by the AMB in 1968, of some modified schemes proposed in 1976, and of an alternative system whereby rights to export to premium export markets with quota restrictions are auctioned.

50|$|Uranium mining in Australia {{has been}} highly political, {{particularly}} for the Australian Labor Party(ALP) at both state and federal level.

50|$|An Open General Licence (OGL) {{is a type}} of <b>export</b> <b>licence</b> {{issued by}} a {{government}} to its domestic suppliers.

50|$|When {{it turned}} out {{that it would not be}} {{possible}} for Sweden to get <b>export</b> <b>licences</b> for US-built computers, the activities of MMN quickly changed into constructing rather than importing computing machinery. The relay-based BARK, operational in 1950, was built as an interim measure. This was followed by the vacuum tube-based BESK, operational in 1954, which for a short time was the fastest computer in the world.|$|R

Cable came under pressure from the prime minister David Cameron, defence secretary Michael Fallon and foreign secretary Philip Hammond for the immediate resumption of exports. Cable stated he was then given specific assurances by the Ministry of Defence that the UK would be given oversight of potential bombing targets to minimise the risk of civilian casualties, including involvement in decisions, to a similar level given to the United States. On this understanding Cable agreed to issue <b>export</b> <b>licences</b> for a £200 million order for the weapons. In 2016 it became apparent the Ministry of Defence did not have this level of oversight, to which Cable responded [...] "That is categorically contrary to what I was told was going to happen." [...] The sale is being investigated by the Committees on Arms Export Controls.|$|R

The Ministry of Foreign Trade managed trade and {{was responsible for}} issuing of import and <b>export</b> <b>licences</b> and approving any departures from the formal economic plan on an ad hoc basis. There was considerable division of responsibility, however, among high level agencies, financial institutions, state trading corporations, local export companies, and provincial and regional government bodies.|$|R

50|$|The scam {{involved}} {{diversion of}} export-oriented sugar in domestic market. In 2001-02, these co-operatives had obtained <b>export</b> <b>licence</b> for 228,000 tonnes of sugar, but in collusion with export agents, diverted the sugar {{to the domestic}} market. This led {{to the collapse of}} domestic sugar prices and caused major losses to sugarcane farmers besides excise evasion of nearly 800 million rupees. The Muktabai SSK sugar cooperative factory was one of the companies which figured in the scam.|$|R

Airbus, too, {{has said that it}} requires US's approval to export airliners to Iran, because parts of its aircraft are made in the US.|$|R
