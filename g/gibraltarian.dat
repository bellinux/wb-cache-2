5|$|The {{population}} (2,932 inhabitants in 2012) primarily {{consists of}} native-born Falkland Islanders, {{the majority of}} British descent. Other ethnicities include French, <b>Gibraltarian</b> and Scandinavian. Immigration from the United Kingdom, the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena, and Chile has reversed a population decline. The predominant (and official) language is English. Under the British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983, Falkland Islanders are British citizens.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 presented Gibraltar with major security concerns, as it was initially {{on the front lines}} of the conflict. The ultimately successful rebellion led by General Francisco Franco broke out across the Strait in Morocco, and the Spanish Republican government sought on several occasions to regain control of the Nationalist-controlled area around Algeciras. Although Gibraltar was not directly affected by the fighting, the war caused significant disruption. An undetermined number of Spanish refugees, perhaps as many as 10,000 persons, fled to Gibraltar, resulting in severe overcrowding. A Non-Intervention Patrol was mounted by the Royal Navy, operating from Gibraltar, to prevent foreign military aid reaching the belligerents in Spain. In May 1937, one of the ships involved in the patrol, the destroyer HMS Hunter, hit a Nationalist mine and had to be towed back to Gibraltar with eight of her crew dead. The Spanish Civil War had a deep impact on <b>Gibraltarian</b> society. On one hand, the British authorities, the Anglican and Catholic churches and the <b>Gibraltarian</b> moneyed class supported the Nationalists in the War, while the working class sided with the Republicans. With Europe sliding towards a general war, the British Government decided to strengthen Gibraltar's defences and upgrade the naval base to accommodate the latest generation of battleships and aircraft carriers. A Gibraltar Defence Force (now the Royal Gibraltar Regiment) was established in March 1939 to assist with home defence.|$|E

50|$|Together, <b>Gibraltarians</b> of Spanish origin {{are one of}} {{the bigger}} groups (more than 24% {{according}} to last names, even more taking into account the fact that many Spanish women married native <b>Gibraltarians).</b>|$|R
50|$|The UK {{originally}} regarded <b>Gibraltarians</b> as British Overseas Territories citizens (BOTC). In 1981 <b>Gibraltarians</b> successfully campaigned {{against this}} classification under the British Nationality Act, {{which would have}} deprived them {{of the right of}} abode in the UK, along with other colonial subjects. This was partly due to Gibraltar's status as part of the then European Community (now European Union). As a result, the <b>Gibraltarians</b> acquired the right to register as full British citizens.|$|R
5|$|Financed, {{trained and}} {{equipped}} by the Germans, the saboteurs sank the armed trawler , and destroyed the auxiliary minesweeper , {{which resulted in}} the deaths of six British seamen on 18 January 1942. Plazas was assisted by the Spanish naval commander of Puente Mayorga, Manuel Romero Hume, who allowed him to beach a rowboat there. The British intelligence was able however to counteract the sabotage operations. In March 1942, a <b>Gibraltarian,</b> José Key, {{one of the most prominent}} agents working for the Germans, responsible for the collection of information on military movements for the Abwehr was arrested and executed in Wandsworth Prison in late 1942. By September 1942, Plazas, whose activities were closely monitored by the British at that time, resigned and left Carlos Calvo, his second in command, in charge of the operations. In late 1942, the German headquarters in Berlin ordered the sabotage operations being expanded. In early 1943, the arrival of an experienced head of Abwehr operations in Spain improved the outreach of the operations.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its commanding position, Gibraltar provided a strongly defended harbour from which ships could operate in both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Force H, {{under the command of}} Vice-Admiral James Somerville was based in Gibraltar and had the task of maintaining naval superiority and providing a strong escort for convoys to and from the besieged island of Malta. During the course of the war, Gibraltar came under aerial bombardment from Vichy French aircraft and from aircraft of the Italian Royal Air Force (Regia Aeronautica) based on Sardinia. Additionally, the fortress was the focus of underwater attacks by the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina) commando frogman unit (Decima Flottiglia MAS) and their human torpedoes. This Italian unit was based on the interned Italian ship SS Olterra in the nearby Spanish harbour of Algeciras. A number of attacks were also carried out by Spanish and <b>Gibraltarian</b> agents acting on behalf of the German Abwehr.|$|E
5|$|Lesser known {{than the}} Italian actions were the {{sabotage}} operations and limpet-mine attacks {{carried out by}} Spanish and <b>Gibraltarian</b> agents recruited in the Campo de Gibraltar by the Germans. The Abwehr contacted a Spanish staff officer from Campo de Gibraltar, Lieutenant Colonel Eleuterio Sánchez Rubio, a Spanish officer, member of the Falange and coordinator of the intelligence operations in the Campo, to establish a network of saboteurs with access to Gibraltar. Sánchez Rubio designated Emilio Plazas Tejera, {{also a member of}} Falange, as operations chief of the organisation. Most of the recruits for the sabotage operations were Spaniards from the Campo. A combination of financial reward, ideological commitment and some threats and intimidation were used to gather a significant number of agents. According to the British intelligence, there were at least 183 Spaniards and Gibraltarians involved in the espionage and sabotage operations against Gibraltar.|$|E

25|$|Native Gibraltarians have {{produced}} some literature of note. The first in fiction was probably Héctor Licudi's 1929 novel Barbarita, written in Spanish, chronicling the largely autobiographical adventures {{of a young}} <b>Gibraltarian</b> man. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, several anthologies of poetry were published by Leopoldo Sanguinetti, Albert Joseph Patron and Alberto Pizzarello. The 1960s were largely dominated by the theatrical works of Elio Cruz and his two highly acclaimed Spanish language plays La Lola se va pá Londre and Connie con cama camera en el comedor. In the 1990s, the <b>Gibraltarian</b> man-of-letters Mario Arroyo published Profiles (1994), a series of bilingual meditations on love, loneliness and death. Trino Cruz is a bilingual poet originally writing English but now mainly in Spanish, who also translates Maghreb poetry. Of late there have been works by the essayist Mary Chiappe, such as her volume of essays Cabbages and Kings (2006) and by M. G. Sanchez, author of the books Rock Black: Ten <b>Gibraltarian</b> Stories (2008) and Diary of a Victorian Colonial (2009). Mary Chiappe and Sam Benady have also published a series of detective books centred {{on the character of}} the nineteenth-century <b>Gibraltarian</b> sleuth Bresciano.|$|E

25|$|On 31 March 2015 the {{government}} of Gibraltar announced {{the adoption of the}} University of Gibraltar Act and The University of Gibraltar opened in September 2015. Previously, there were no facilities in Gibraltar for full-time higher education, and consequently, all <b>Gibraltarian</b> students studied elsewhere at degree level or its equivalent and also for certain non-degree courses. The Government of Gibraltar operates a scholarship/grant system to provide funding for students studying in the United Kingdom. All <b>Gibraltarian</b> students used to follow the UK student loans procedure, applying for a loan from the Student Loans Company which was then reimbursed in full by the Government of Gibraltar. In August 2010, this system was replaced by the direct payment by {{the government}} of grants and tuition fees. The overwhelming majority of Gibraltarians continue their studies at university level.|$|E
40|$|This study {{deal with}} the {{qualitative}} difference between governing nation-states and peoples' lived experiences. Borderlands are places {{on the edge of}} states and thus provide a starting point to view state powers' influences on people living in places. Gibraltar then is a border town and a British dependency territory {{at the tip of the}} Iberian Peninsula and has been a source of tensions for nearly 300 years. The tensions are rooted in the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) where Gibraltar where ceded to Britain. However, the treaty gave Spain right of "first refusal" should Britain ever decide to relinquish sovereignty over Gibraltar. Although it seems that Britain wants to conceal the Gibraltar question to not sour the relation with Spain, according to the Gibraltar's constitution (1969), Britain is committed to continue her presence in Gibraltar as long as the <b>Gibraltarians</b> wish it. In other words, Britain can neither give Gibraltar to Spain nor to the <b>Gibraltarians.</b> Spain, on the other hand, has tried to regain Gibraltar since Britain's capture of it. But <b>Gibraltarians</b> do not wish to become Spanish citizens, which is their worst nightmare, as we will see in this thesis. Thus I argue that those who live in borderlands experience the border differently than state powers to which borders become abstract lines on a map. It will be seen that, when the border between Spain and Gibraltar starts to be blurred or endangered, <b>Gibraltarians</b> feel an ontological uncertainty, and border maintenance becomes crucial. This is seen in the HMS Tireless event when Britain decided to repair a faulty nuclear powered submarine in Gibraltar. Although <b>Gibraltarians</b> are concerned about risk with the repair, it becomes secondary. Instead the Gibraltar question emerges - that is "who owns Gibraltar?" - and <b>Gibraltarians</b> struggle to maintain their status as a distinct people. Hence, to <b>Gibraltarians</b> who are being-in-place, the event was "deep play. ...|$|R
5000|$|English (used {{in schools}} and for {{official}} purposes) and Spanish are the main languages of Gibraltar. Although English is the official language, <b>Gibraltarians</b> are typically bilingual, speaking Spanish as fluently as English. [...] Most <b>Gibraltarians</b> converse in Llanito, Gibraltar's vernacular. It is an old dialect of Andalusian Spanish with modern British English influence, as well as influences from Genoese Ligurian, Maltese, Portuguese and Haketia. <b>Gibraltarians</b> may also code-switch to English. Hebrew is spoken by the significant Jewish community. Arabic is also spoken by the Moroccan community, similar to Hindi and Sindhi being spoken by the Indian community of Gibraltar. Maltese is still spoken by some families of Maltese descent.|$|R
