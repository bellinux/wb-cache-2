50|$|The use of {{weighted}} {{clothing is}} a form of resistance training, generally a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> training. In addition to the greater effect of gravity on the person, it also adds resistance during ballistic movements, due to more force needed to overcome the inertia of heavier masses, as well as a greater momentum that needs deceleration {{at the end of the}} movement to avoid injury. The method may increase muscle mass or lose weight; however, there have been concerns about the safety of some uses of weights, such as wrist and ankle weights. It is normally done in the form of small weights, attached to increase endurance when performed in long repetitive events, such as running, swimming, punching, kicking or jumping. Heavier weighted clothing can also be used for slow, controlled movements, and as a way to add resistance to body-weight exercises.|$|E

In this paper, concerned with the highest-load attack (HL) and random attack (RA) on one edge, we define five <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>weighting</b> strategies to assign the external resources for recovering the edges from cascading failures in heterogeneous scale-free (SF) networks. The influence of external resources, the tolerance parameter, and the different weighting strategies on SF networks against cascading failures is investigated carefully. We find that, under HL attack, the fourth <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weighting</b> method can more effectively improve the integral robustness of SF networks, simultaneously control the spreading velocity, and control the outburst of cascading failures in SF networks than other methods. Moreover, the third method is optimal if we only knew the local structure of SF networks and the uniform assignment is the worst. The simulations of the real-world autonomous system in, Internet have also supported our findings. The results are useful for using efficient response strategy against the emergent accidents and controlling the cascading failures in the real-world networks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In neural networks, network faults can be {{exhibited}} in different forms, such as node fault and weight fault. One <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> faults {{is due to}} the hardware or software precision. This <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> faults can be modelled as multiplicative weight noise. This paper analyzes the capacity of a bidirectional associative memory (BAM) affected by multiplicative weight noise. Assuming that weights are corrupted by multiplicative noise, we study how many number of pattern pairs can be stored as fixed points. Since capacity is not meaningful without considering the error correction capability, we also present the capacity of a BAM with multiplicative noise when there are some errors in the input pattern. Simulation results have been carried out to confirm our derivations. ...|$|E

40|$|In the {{research}} on network security, distinguishing the vulnerable components of networks {{is very important for}} protecting infrastructures systems. Here, we probe how to identify the vulnerable nodes of complex networks in cascading failures, which was ignored before. Concerned with random attack (RA) and highest load attack (HL) on nodes, we model cascading dynamics of complex networks. Then, we introduce four kinds of weighting methods to characterize the nodes of networks including Barabási-Albert scale-free networks (SF), Watts-Strogatz small-world networks (WS), Erdos-Renyi random networks (ER), and two real-world networks. The simulations show that, for SF networks under HL attack, the nodes with small value of the fourth <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> are the most vulnerable and the ones with small value of the third weight are also vulnerable. Also, the real-world autonomous system with power-law distribution verifies these findings. Moreover, for WS and ER networks under both RA and HL attack, when the nodes have low tolerant ability, the ones with small value of the fourth <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> are more vulnerable and also the ones with high degree are easier to break down. The results give us important theoretical basis for digging the potential safety loophole and making protection strategy...|$|E

40|$|Behavioral {{scientists}} appear widely divided {{about the}} merits of standardized versus unstandardized regression weights. The present paper has therefore attempted to clarify the issue by illustrating how the two kinds of weights respond to the following circumstances: selection, or sampling variation, on the independent variable; presence of measurement error; changes in units of measurement; scales that are relative to norms rather than absolute; changes in test length; and selection on dependent and mediating variables. Standardized weights are invariant over changes in the units of measurement; unstandardized weights are invariant over selection on the independent variable (but only on the independent variable) and {{in the presence of}} dependent variable error.

40|$|A {{neural network}} model that can {{simulate}} the learning of some simple proportional analogies is presented. These analogies include, for example, (a) red-square:red-circle # yellow-square:?, (b) apple:red # banana: ?, (c) a:b # c:?. Underlying {{the development of this}} network is a theory for how the brain learns the nature of association between pairs of concepts. Traditional Hebbian learning of associations is necessary for this process but not sufficient. This is because it simply says, for example, that the concepts "apple" and "red" have been associated, but says nothing about the nature of this relationship. The types of context-dependent interlevel connections in the network suggest a semilocal type of learning that in some manner involves association among more than two nodes or neurons at once. Such connections have been called synaptic triads, and related to potential cell responses in the prefrontal cortex. Some additional types of connections are suggested by the problem of modeling analogies. These types of connections have not yet been verified by brain imaging, but the work herein suggests that they may occur and, possibly, be made and broken quickly in the course of working memory encoding. These working memory connections are referred to as differential, delayed and anti-Hebbian connections. In these connections, one can learn transitions such as "keep red the same"; "change red to yellow"; "turn off red"; "turn on yellow," and so forth.
