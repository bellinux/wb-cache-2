In {{order to}} explore micro-beam {{relaxation}} dynamics of MEMS, the beam deflection relaxation expression considering air slide-film damping effect was educed based on Euler–Bernoulli equation with boundary conditions of two <b>hinged</b> <b>ends.</b> The beam deflection relaxation process under over damping, critical damping and under damping was calculated used Maple.

5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinguished}} fortepiano builders in the era following Silbermann {{was one of his}} pupils, Johann Andreas Stein, who worked in Augsburg, Germany. Stein's fortepianos had (what we, or Cristofori, would call) [...] "backwards" [...] hammers, with the striking end closer to the player than the <b>hinged</b> <b>end.</b> This action came to be called the [...] "Viennese" [...] action, and was widely used in Vienna, even on pianos up to the mid 19th century. The Viennese action was simpler than the Cristofori action, and very sensitive to the player's touch. According to Edwin M. Ripin (see references below), the force needed to depress a key on a Viennese fortepiano was only about a fourth of what it is on a modern piano, and the descent of the key only about half as much. Thus playing the Viennese fortepiano involved nothing like the athleticism exercised by modern piano virtuosos, but did require exquisite sensitivity of touch.|$|E

Attached to the parameter of the boom are gondola cars with kite tops. The cars are designed to hold 3 people in a laid position. In the center most models of these rides have a triangle center ornament with lights. This ride also has a very strong light package bar set, running along the perimeter of the boom. The ride most commonly uses kites, flags and banners in its operating structure to hide its skeletal lurking beams. The rides paint usually consists of neon, or bold colors.

50|$|The Columbia tong test ammeter (illustrated) is {{an example}} of the iron vane type, used for {{measuring}} large AC currents up to 1000 amperes. The iron jaws of the meter direct the magnetic field surrounding the conductor to an iron vane that is attached to the needle of the meter. The iron vane moves in proportion to the strength of the magnetic field, and thus produces a meter indication proportional to the current. This type of ammeter can measure both AC and DC currents and provides a true RMS current measurement of non-sinusoidal or distorted AC waveforms. Interchangeable meter movements can be installed in the clamping assembly to provide various full-scale current values up to 1000 amperes. The iron vane is in a small cylinder that is inserted in a space at the <b>hinged</b> <b>end</b> of the clamp-on jaws. Several jaw sizes are available for clamping around large conductors and bus bars up to 4+1/2 in wide. As the illustration shows, the scale is very non-linear and unsuitable for measuring low currents, with currents of less than half the full-scale deflection crammed into a short section of the dial.|$|E

We consider the widely studied boundary conditions corresponding to clamped and <b>hinged</b> <b>ends</b> and many non-local boundary conditions, with a unified approach.

The results are new even for the classic boundary conditions of clamped or <b>hinged</b> <b>ends</b> when α[u]= 0, because we obtain sharp results for the existence of one positive solution; for multiple solutions we seek optimal values of some of the constants that occur in the theory, which allows us to impose weaker assumptions on the nonlinear term than in previous works.

40|$|Free undamped {{in-plane}} vibrations of shear undeformable beams {{around their}} highly buckled configurations are investigated neglecting rotary inertia effects. The beams are inertially nonuniform since a lumped mass is rigidly clamped along the span. Two mechanical models are considered {{depending on the}} boundary conditions in the post-buckling phases. First, the beam is considered inextensible because it is hinged {{at one end and}} is acted upon by an axial compressive force on the other end, a roller support, both in the buckling and post-buckling phases. In the second model, the beam is extensible in the post-buckling phase because the roller support boundary is changed into a fixed <b>hinged</b> <b>end.</b> Free undamped vibrations are governed, in the first case, by a homogeneous integral-partial-differential equation and, in the second case. by two coupled partial-differential equations with variable coefficients.

40|$|Experiments and {{numerical}} simulations {{were conducted}} to investigate the dynamic response in a pipe-on-pipe impact event, in which a missile (swinging) pipe with one end hinged and the other end free impinges on an orthogonal simply-supported/clamped target pipe at its centre. This study focuses {{on the effects of}} the impact location on the missile pipe and the wall thickness of the pipes. The experiments were carried out by using a spring-powered catapult impact setup, the specimens used were made of seamless steel pipes of two different thicknesses, 1 mm and 3 mm respectively, and the target pipes were clamped. Seven tests were carried out using the catapult. Numerical simulations using the explicit finite element code LS-DYNA were performed on an HPC 360 workstation for each of the seven test cases. The results of the experiments and numerical simulations were compared, showing good agreement. Having confirmed the validity of the numerical model, numerical simulations were applied to the cases of a simply-supported target pipe, and the partitioning of the energy dissipation was calculated. As the response mode depends significantly on the initial impact position, the evolution of the response mode was examined numerically as the point of impact on the missile pipe was moved from the <b>hinged</b> <b>end</b> to the free end. it was found that there is a particular impact location for which the target pipe was most seriously damaged using the same impact speed.

40|$|The natural {{frequencies}} and mode shapes of planar shear undeformable beams around their curved prestressed post-buckling configurations are investigated. Two mechanical models are considered {{depending on the}} assumed boundary conditions in the buckling and post-buckling phases. Namely, with the first model, the beam is considered inextensible because it is hinged {{at one end and}} is acted upon by an axial compressive force on the other end, a roller support. In the second case, the beam is assumed inextensible in the buckling phase (same boundary conditions as above), however, it is considered extensible in the subsequent post-buckling phase because the roller support is changed into a <b>hinged</b> <b>end.</b> The post-buckling solution is obtained with three approaches: asymptotic, numerical via evaluation of an elliptic integral, and numerical via finite-element formulation (FEM). Due to the non-constant curvature, the equations of motion governing linear vibrations around the post-buckling configuration are linear partial-differential equations with non-constant coefficients and the solutions for the frequencies and mode shapes are found employing two approximate approaches: a fully numerical FEM approach and a semi-analytical method based on a weak formulation (Galerkin method) implemented in an in-house built code. The main results are compared and a close agreement in the outcomes is found. The leading mechanical differences in the linear normal modes of the two prestressed elastica arch models and their potential influence on nonlinear vibrations are discussed.

Examples of such axially loaded beams are beam columns (compressive axial load) and piano strings (tensile axial load). The Barcilon-Gottlieb transformation is invoked to transform the non-uniform beam equation into the axially loaded uniform beam equation. The coupled ODEs involved in this transformation are solved for two specific cases (pq (z) = k (0) and q = q (0)), and analytical solutions for mass and stiffness are obtained. Examples of beams having a rectangular cross section are shown as a practical application of the analysis. Some non-uniform beams are found whose frequencies are known exactly since uniform axially loaded beams with clamped ends have closed-form solutions.
