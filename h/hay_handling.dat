40|$|Cotton is an {{important}} crop in Greece, covering more than 255, 000 ha every year. Apart from the lint and seed, cotton produces large amounts of residues {{that can be used}} for energy production. The aim of this work was to study the performance of the machinery used for harvesting cotton residues. Conventional hay harvesting machinery was used for harvesting cotton residues in Central Greece. A mower, a rake and a baler were used for cutting, windrowing and baling cotton stalks, respectively. Data were collected from 41 fields. The performance of the farm machinery was recorded using low cost Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, which also acted as data loggers, placed on each tractor. Data analysis was performed using the MATLAB (R) technical programming language. The effective time and the field capacity were estimated for each operation. The effective time was 69 % for cutting, 68 % for windrowing and 60 % for baling. The measured average field capacities were 2. 64 ha h(- 1) (3. 38 t h(- 1)), 2. 1 ha h(- 1) (2. 76 t h(- 1)), and 3. 71 ha h(- 1) (4. 47 t h(- 1)), for the cutting, windrowing, and baling operations, respectively. These results are considerably different from the corresponding estimations for <b>hay</b> <b>handling</b> operations using existing available databases and software tools. This deviation reveals that average norms for the prediction of machinery performance during <b>hay</b> <b>handling</b> cannot be used for the scheduling of handling operations for cotton residues within the bioenergy production supply chain.

40|$|New {{technology}} in <b>hay</b> <b>handling</b> and harvesting methods for stacking loose hay has been introduced. This {{new technology is}} in the form of two machines: (1) a large self-propelled mower-windrower combination and (2) a power-take-off operated stacking machine. One man can now mow and windrow the hay in one operation. The stack can then be made by one man, as the stacker is pulled through the field picking up hay from the windrow and elevating or blowing it into a stack-making container. The finished stacked can then either be dropped in the field or hauled to another location for unloading. This new technology will change the way farmers handle and harvest hay. Therefore, this thesis has the following primary objectives: 1. To evaluate the experiences of those who have adopted the completely mechanized haying systems. 2. To determine the acres and yields necessary to justify investment in the completely mechanized system. 3. To compare the costs of the mechanized system with the costs of alternative systems. 4. To develop a decision of criterion for the selection of the least expensive haying system. Advisor: Thomas L. Fre...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePrevious studies {{performed}} in France {{have suggested that}} <b>handling</b> <b>hay</b> contaminated with high amounts of moulds, and especially Absidia corymbifera and Eurotium amstelodami, may favour farmer's lung disease. The circumstances favouring farmer's lung disease and the distinctive microbiological composition of hay samples that provoke attacks need to be specified. We present a case-control study which investigates the agricultural practices and the microbiological composition of <b>hay</b> <b>handled</b> in patients with farmer's lung disease as compared to those of a representative control population. Ten cases identified the <b>hay</b> they were <b>handling</b> {{at the onset of}} symptoms. The location, type of farm and working conditions were {{similar to those of the}} control farms. Conversely, the microbiological composition of hay differed, with significantly higher amounts of E. amstelodami (P < 0. 01), A. corymbifera (P = 0. 003), mesophilic Streptomyces (P < 0. 01), thermophilic Streptomyces (P < 0. 01) and Saccharomonospora viridis (P < 0. 01) than in the control population. Our results demonstrate that hay identified by patients as having a harmful effect is characterized by a higher total amount of microorganisms, notably five microorganisms that seem discriminative. Mean concentrations are 2 - to 115 -fold higher in hay suspected to cause symptoms than in hay from a representative panel of farms. <b>Handling</b> <b>hay</b> with high amounts of these five microorganisms constitutes a risk factor for farmer's lung disease that should be considered for the development of prophylactic measures...|$|R

30|$|Grass {{production}} for storage as hay {{requires a lot}} of care from harvest handling which may determine the quality after storage to feeding. Crude protein (CP) has been used widely as proxy for feed quality analysis and has been reported to decline depending on post harvest handling. The same nutrient has been reported to be among the most limiting in the drylands especially during the dry seasons. Mechanisms of handling and storage to reduce its decline in forage during handling are imperative. The measurement of this vital nutrient that is most limiting in hay was therefore picked in this study and was measured from different curing methods and storage periods. We therefore evaluated the effect of stage of maturity (mature flowering at 12 -week phonological stage) and duration of curing before storage for periods of 2, 12, 24, and 36  weeks on the quality of hay. The selected grass species in were C. roxburghiana (CR), E. superb (ES), E. macrostachyus (EM), C. ciliaris (CC), C. gayana (CG), and S. sudanense (SB). The six were selected from their ranking as best species for hay and reseeding in Rangelands. This study aimed to provide vital information on <b>hay</b> <b>handling</b> from harvest to storage in Kenyan rangelands for quality preservation of pastures that has high demand during the dry seasons. The study sort to answer our hypothesis that hay curing and storage affects the quality of the end product in the Kenyan rangelands.|$|E

We investigated and compared the initial response of respiratory epithelium after exposure to extracts of Sacharopolyspora rectivirgula, Lichtheimia corymbifera (formerly Absidia corymbifera), Eurotium amstelodami and Wallemia sebi. The two criteria for selection of these species were their high prevalence in the <b>hay</b> <b>handled</b> by FLD patients and the presence of high levels of specific precipitins to these molds in FLD patients' sera. Hydrosoluble extracts were prepared from spores and hyphae grown in culture under optimal conditions {{for each of the four}} species. Confluent A 549 cells were inoculated with one of the four calibrated soluble extracts. Two mediators, one inflammatory (Interleukin (IL) - 8) and one allergic (IL- 13), were quantified using real-time PCR and ELISA assay, after four exposure periods (30 min, 2 h, 4 h and 8 h). S. rectivirgula and L. corymbifera extracts were the only ones which induced a marked upregulation of IL- 8, as shown by both real-time PCR and ELISA assay 8 h after the initial contact. This study adds to the growing body of evidence that L. corymbifera should be recognized as an etiologic agent of FLD along with S. rectivirgula...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Our aim was {{to study}} {{respiratory}} symptoms and lung function decline in farmers, with {{particular attention to the}} influence of <b>handling</b> <b>hay,</b> straw and animal feed. From a cohort recruited in 1993 – 1994, 219 (82. 6 %) dairy farmers, 130 (62. 5 %) nondairy agricultural workers and 99 (66. 4 %) controls were re-evaluated in 2006. They answered medical and occupational questionnaires, underwent spirometric tests at both evaluations and pulse oximetry in 2006. Dairy and nondairy agricultural workers showed an increased risk for usual morning phlegm (adjusted OR 4. 27 (95 % CI 1. 41 – 12. 95) and 3. 59 (95 % CI 1. 16 – 11. 10), respectively). Animal feed handling was associated with increased risks of wheezing (p 50. 01) and usual morning phlegm (p 50. 04); <b>hay</b> or straw <b>handling</b> was associated with increased risk of wheezing (p 50. 008). Adjusting for smoking, age, height, sex and altitude, dairy farmers had greater declines in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) /forced vital capacity ratio (p 50. 01) than controls. An increased decline in FEV 1 for all agricultural workers was associated with animal feed handling, both measured as a categorical (currently versus never handling; p 50. 05) or quantitative value (years of exposure during the survey period; p 50. 03). Hay, straw or animal feed handling represents a risk factor of bronchial symptoms and, for animal feed only, of accelerated decline in expiratory flows...|$|R
40|$|Wallemia sebi is a deuteromycete fungus {{commonly}} found in agricultural environments {{in many parts of}} the world and is suspected to be a causative agent of farmer's lung disease. The fungus grows slowly on commonly used culture media and is often obscured by the fast-growing fungi. Thus, its occurrence in different environments has often been underestimated. In this study, we developed two sets of PCR primers specific to W. sebi that can be applied in either conventional PCR or real-time PCR for rapid detection and quantification of the fungus in environmental samples. Both PCR systems proved to be highly specific and sensitive for W. sebi detection even in a high background of other fungal DNAs. These methods were employed to investigate the presence of W. sebi in the aerosols of a farm. The results revealed a high concentration of W. sebi spores, 107 m− 3 by real-time PCR and 106 m− 3 by cultivation, which indicates the prevalence of W. sebi in farms <b>handling</b> <b>hay</b> and grain and in cow barns. The methods developed in this study could serve as rapid, specific, and sensitive means of detecting W. sebi in aerosol and surface samples and could thus facilitate investigations of its distribution, ecology, clinical diagnosis, and exposure risk assessment...|$|R
5000|$|The {{railroad}} {{was started}} quite {{late in the}} [...] "copper boom" [...] and the railway's fortunes turned after two years. The open roasting of the ores prior to smelting, necessary {{because of the high}} sulfur content, released clouds of smoke and toxic fumes, which had disastrous effects on any plant life that came in contact with it. In July 1910, following the filing of a suit by the U.S. government regarding damage being done to the nearby national forests, the Bully Hill smelter was closed down, never to revived by General Electric. The cost if installing mechanical roasters was to costly in light of the now declining copper prices. Meanwhile, the SV&E continued providing a service with a [...] "skunk" [...] gasoline motor car being used in later years to carry passengers, mail and express from Pitt out on the line. While the smelter business was shaky, there was at least a less-than-carload business of sorts with milk, farm equipment, papers, and <b>hay</b> being <b>handled</b> by the line. In 1917, Walter Arnstein, president of the Oakland and Antioch Railroad, and owner of the Nevada County Narrow Gauge, secured a long-term lease and the mining of copper and zinc resumed. DeLamar's original 30" [...] gauge railroad was utilized to transfer the ore to DeLamar where it was loaded onto standard gauge cars and shipped via the Sacramento Valley and Eastern and the Southern Pacific to the Mammoth Smelter at Kennet (now under Shasta Lake). Smelting operations were revived at Bully Hill in early 1920, only to be stopped again following declining prices in 1922. In 1920, Shasta Zinc and Copper Company acquired the mine and smelter area and in 1924, consolidated several mines in the area, including the Afterthought at Ingot, from which an ariel tramway was constructed in 1925, connecting it with the smelter at Bully Hill, about 8 mi away. A material known as Shasta zinc oxide was produced, which was an ingredient in paint and rubber tires among other things. The final product was shipped out via SV&E and SP to San Francisco where it was placed on a steam ship to be sent to Baltimore.|$|R
40|$|Production {{analysis}} and survey data {{suggests that the}} greatest contribution to annual cow production costs in the Northern Plains is harvested and purchased feed (Taylor and Field, 1995). Harvested hay is not only expensive to purchase, but it is expensive to put up and feed. Dunn (2002) showed that interest and depreciation on capital (required to <b>handle</b> <b>hay)</b> were major factors limiting profitability of ranching operations. Profit margins in cow/calf production are slim due to high production costs (Taylor and Field, 1995) and lost opportunity to capture value from marketable ranch products (NASS, 1999). Low input systems, or systems that reduce hay feeding, may add profitability to producers. Systems that rely more on grazing and less on harvested and purchased feedstuffs have a higher potential to be profitable (Adams et al., 1994). Early weaning practices may be beneficial when forage supplies are low and supplemental feed is costly. Work done by Meyers et al. (1999 a, b) and Fluharty et al. (2000) showed early-weaned steer calves when compared to those calves weaned at traditional ages may have comparable average daily gains and improved feed efficiency during the postweaning period. While {{it is clear that}} reduced-input systems have a greater potential for positive returns, management of cattle becomes increasingly important on these low- or reduced-input systems. Management of calving dates, weaning dates, supplementation programs and monitoring and managing cow condition at critical times throughout the production year, are key elements in achieving good performance in the herd...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn France and Finland, farmer's {{lung disease}} (FLD), a {{hypersensitivity}} pneumonitis common in agricultural areas, is {{mainly caused by}} Eurotium species. The presence of antibodies in patients' serum is an important criterion for diagnosis. Our study aimed to improve the serological diagnosis of FLD by using common fungal particles that pollute the farm environment as antigens. Fungal particles of the Eurotium species were observed in <b>handled</b> <b>hay.</b> A strain of Eurotium amstelodami was grown in vitro using selected culture media; and antigen extracts from sexual (ascospores), asexual (conidia), and vegetative (hyphae) forms were made. Antigens were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which {{was used to test}} for immunoglobulin G antibodies from the sera of 17 FLD patients, 40 healthy exposed farmers, and 20 nonexposed controls. The antigens were compared by receiver operating characteristic analysis, and a threshold was then established. The ascospores contained in asci enclosed within cleistothecia were present in 38 % of the hay blades observed; conidial heads of aspergillus were less prevalent. The same protocol was followed to make the three antigen extracts. A comparison of the results for FLD patients and exposed controls showed the area under the curve to be 0. 850 for the ascospore antigen, 0. 731 for the conidia, and 0. 690 for the hyphae. The cutoffs that we determined, with the standard deviation for measures being taken into account, showed 67 % for sensitivity and 92 % for specificity with the ascospore antigen.

40|$|The {{experience}} of Michigan farmers illustrates the dilemma faced by hay growers: while hay production {{has received a}} great deal of attention, hay marketing has been neglected. Supplies of high quality hay can be expanded within the span of a single growing season, but the marketing system generates prices which do not always clear the market and which do not serve as accurate signals to guide planning decisions. More fundamentally, there are no effective market mechanisms to generate those prices, to match buyers and sellers, or to move hay cheaply from surplus to deficit regions. Clearly, this is not because hay is a minor crop. In Michigan, hay is the second largest crop grown on a per acre basis. Apart from the direct economic value of hay, it has some important indirect benefits. Acreage sown to hay is far less susceptible to soil erosion than land that has been planted to row crops. In addition, alfalfa increases the soil tilth and water holding capacity. Hay, especially alfalfa hay, increases the future productivity of the soil through the control of soil erosion and increased fertility. Given the economic importance of hay, why hasn't more effort been devoted to creating more orderly markets? The vast majority of hay is used on the farm where it is produced. While there are commercial hay producers, most of the hay moving to market is surplus production from dairy and cattle feeding operations. Consequently, there has been relatively little producer pressure or effort to improve hay markets. A more compelling reason for this neglect is the heterogeneity of hay. Hay quality depends on stand quality, rainfall, humidity, drying conditions, time and number of cuttings, bale type, and whether or not the operator used artificial drying agents and preservatives. A <b>hay</b> dealer may <b>handle</b> a dozen or more different types of hay. The problem, at least according to some dealers, growers, and buyers, is one of complexity. Any uniform national grading standard must be versatile enough to describe numerous types of hay made under highly variable conditions which have a dramatic effect on quality and palatability. This uniformity is easier to achieve in hay grown in the west than in hay grown in eastern states. Another reason that so little effort has been devoted to improved hay marketing is as old as humankind: resistance to change. In light of the disorganized and fragmented nature of hay markets, the potential for improved economic performance through institutional change is significant. Marketing,...|$|R
