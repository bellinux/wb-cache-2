5|$|The {{boundaries}} of Slavonia, as a geographical region, {{do not necessarily}} coincide with {{the borders of the}} five counties, except in the south and east where the Sava and Danube rivers define them. The international borders of Croatia are boundaries common to both definitions of the region. In the north, the boundaries largely coincide because the Drava River is considered to be the northern border of Slavonia as a <b>geographic</b> region, but this excludes Baranya from the <b>geographic</b> region's definition even though this territory is part of a county otherwise associated with Slavonia. The western boundary of the <b>geographic</b> region is not specifically defined and it was variously defined through history depending on the political divisions of Croatia. The eastern Croatia, as a <b>geographic</b> term, largely overlaps most definitions of Slavonia. It is defined as the territory of the Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Požega-Slavonia, Virovitica-Podravina and Vukovar-Syrmia counties, including Baranya.|$|E
