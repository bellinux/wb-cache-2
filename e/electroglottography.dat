50|$|The most {{important}} indirect methods are currently inverse filtering of either microphone or oral airflow recordings and <b>electroglottography</b> (EGG). In inverse filtering, the speech sound (the radiated acoustic pressure waveform, as {{obtained from a}} microphone) or the oral airflow waveform from a circumferentially vented (CV) mask is recorded outside the mouth and then filtered by a mathematical method to remove {{the effects of the}} vocal tract. This method produces an estimate of the waveform of the glottal airflow pulses, which in turn reflect the movements of the vocal folds. The other kind of noninvasive indirect indication of vocal fold motion is the <b>electroglottography,</b> in which electrodes placed {{on either side of the}} subject's throat at the level of the vocal folds record the changes in the conductivity of the throat according to how large a portion of the vocal folds are touching each other. It thus yields one-dimensional information of the contact area. Neither inverse filtering nor EGG are sufficient to completely describe the complex 3-dimensional pattern of vocal fold movement, but can provide useful indirect evidence of that movement.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if respiratory and laryngeal function during spontaneous speech production were different for teachers with voice disorders as compared to teachers without voice problems. The basic research questions posed in this study, as assessed during spontaneous speaking were: 1) Do subjects with a voice disorder show differences in lung volume patterns relative to control subjects? 2) Do subjects with a voice disorder show differences in vocal fold approximation as measured by contact quotient and contact index relative to control subjects? 3) Are these between-group differences most pronounced for mock teaching tasks versus a conversational speaking task? 4) Do subjects with a voice disorder rely more on laryngeal versus respiratory-based strategies for increasing loudness level as compared to control subjects?Method: Nine teachers with and nine teachers without voice problems were included in this study. Respiratory function was measured with magnetometry, and laryngeal function was measured with <b>electroglottography.</b> Respiratory and laryngeal function were measured during three spontaneous speaking tasks: a simulated teaching task at a typical and increased loudness level, and a conversational speaking task. Two structured speaking tasks were included for comparison of <b>electroglottography</b> measures: a paragraph reading task and a sustained vowel. Results: Lung volume termination level in spontaneous speaking was significantly lower for the teachers with voice disorders relative to teachers without voice problems. Lung volume initiation level was lower for the teachers with versus without voice problems during teaching-related speaking tasks. Laryngeal function as assessed with <b>electroglottography</b> did not show between-group differences. Across tasks, the measure of contact index was lower (more negative) during the conversational speaking task as compared to the sustained vowel task, indicating greater contact phase asymmetry during vocal fold vibration. Conclusions: These findings suggest that teachers with a voice disorder use different speech breathing strategies than teachers without voice problems. Management of teachers with voice problems may need to incorporate respiratory training that alters lung volume levels during speaking. Future research is needed to determine whether altering such patterns results in improved voice parameters and self-perceived improvement in vocal symptoms...|$|E

Since the evaluation of speech and of homo sapiens have proceed hand-in-hand, it seems reasonable to assume that human speech production mechanisms, and the resulting acoustic signal, are optimally adapted to human speech perception mechanisms. There a lot of method to measure and analyse the speech production, there are Electropalatography (EPG), Accelerometer, Rothenberg Mask, Optical Tracking (Strain gauge), X-ray Microbeam (Magnetometer), Ultrasound, Electromyography (EMG), X-ray cine, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Pressure Transducers, Respitrace, Photoglottography (PGG), Video, <b>Electroglottography</b> (EGG), Velotrace and Photoglossometry. The <b>Electroglottography,</b> sometime also known as Electrolaryngography or Laryngography (trademark of Laryngography Limited) is a non-invasive method of measuring vocal fold contact during voicing without affecting speech production. The electroglottograph or known as EGG measures the variations in impedances to a very small electrical current between the electrodes pair placed across the neck as the area of vocal fold contact changes during voicing. This method was first developed by Fabre (1957) and influential contributions are credited to Fourcin (1971 with Abbertion) and Frokjaer-Jensen (1968 with Thorvaldsen). The computer unit will process the data and display the electroglottograpgh (EGG waveform) in real time then analyse by the pathologies or therapist. They can relate the waveform with the actual movement of vocal fold. The movement here means the closure and opening phase, maximum contact and maximum open between the flap of tissue.

The evidence of such division is given by noticeable transitions in the audio signal, the electroglottographic signal and its derivative, during the production of a glissando. So as to avoid the confusion linked to the notion of register in singing and to bring out the difference between change in the glottis configuration (laryngeal mechanism) and adjustment of the vocal tract (resonance register), the following terminology is proposed: mechanism 0 ("vocal fry"), mechanism I ("modal" or "chest" register), mechanism II ("falsetto" for male voice and "head" register for female voice) and mechanism III ("whistle" register).
