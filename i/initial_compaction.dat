50|$|As with {{standard}} roller chains, self-lubricating roller chains consist of five basic parts: inner plates, outer plates, pins, bushes, and rollers. However, the bushes for self-lubricating chains are sintered metal bushes. Sintered-metal self-lubricating bearings {{are based on}} powder-metallurgy technology. They are economical, suitable for high production rates and can be manufactured to precision tolerances.Specifically, alloyed powdered metal is mixed, then compacted to form the bushing. The <b>initial</b> <b>compaction</b> {{to a large degree}} dictates the density, shape, dimensions, and mechanical properties of the finished part.The bushings are then sintered.Sintered materials have inherent porosity and the presence of pores have both beneficial and detrimental role on the part performance. The pores act as stress concentration zones and reduce the mechanical strength and ductility. However, the presence of pores acts also contribute to the reduction in noise and vibration also serve as lubricant pockets in lubricated contacts. Sintered bearings and gears are also used in many applications where the external lubrication is not possible or not preferred.It is essential that the pores form an interconnected system of controlled size and volume, so that oil is supplied to the entire bearing surface. The rate of oil supply automatically increases with temperature and, therefore, with increasing speeds of rotation, to achieve optimum working conditions.|$|E
50|$|Road rollers use {{the weight}} of the vehicle to {{compress}} the surface being rolled (static) or use mechanical advantage (vibrating). <b>Initial</b> <b>compaction</b> of the substrate on a road project is done using a padfoot drum roller, which achieves higher compaction density due to the pads having less surface area. On large freeways a four wheel compactor with padfoot drum and a blade, such as a Caterpillar 815/825 series machine, would be used due to its high weight, speed and the powerful pushing force to spread bulk material. On regional roads a smaller single padfoot drum machine may be used. The next machine is usually a single smooth drum compactor that compacts the high spots down until the soil is smooth, and this is usually done in combination with a motor grader to get a level surface. Sometimes at this stage a pneumatic tyre roller would be used. These rollers feature two rows (front and back) of pneumatic tyres that overlap, and the flexibility of the tyres provides a kneading action that seals the surface and with some vertical movement of the wheels, enables the roller to operate effectively on uneven ground. Once the soil base is flat the pad drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface. The next course (road base) would be compacted using a smooth single drum, smooth tandem roller or pneumatic tyre roller in combination with a grader, and a water truck to achieve the desired flat surface with the right moisture content for optimum compaction. Once the road base is compacted, the smooth single drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface (There is however an exception, if the single drum has special flat-wide-base tyres on the machine). The final wear course of asphalt concrete (a.k.a. asphalt or blacktop in North America, or macadam in England) is laid using a paver and compacted using a tandem smooth drum roller, a three-point roller or a pneumatic tyre roller. Three point rollers on asphalt were very common once and are still used, but tandem vibrating rollers are the usual choice now, with the pneumatic tyre roller's kneading action being the last roller to seal off the surface.|$|E

Several <b>initial</b> <b>compaction</b> conditions (i. e., dry density and water content) of the bentonite were considered.

40|$|Abstract. An {{extensive}} experimental {{investigation on}} concrete specimens under crushing and fragmentation {{over a large}} scale range (1 : 10) – exploring even very small specimen dimensions (1 cm) – was carried out to evaluate the influence of fragment size distribution on energy density dissipation and related size effect. To obtain a statistically significant fragment production {{as well as the}} total energy dissipated in a given specimen, the experimental procedure was unusually carried out up to a strain of approximately − 95 %, practically corresponding to the <b>initial</b> fragment <b>compaction</b> between the loading platens. The experimental fragment analysis suggests a fractal law for the distribution in particle size; this simply means that fragments derived from a given specimen appear geometrically self-similar at each observation scale. In addition, clear size effects on dissipated energy density are experimentally observed. Fractal concepts permit to quantify the correlation between fragment size distribution and size effect on dissipated energy density, the latter being governed by the total surface area of produced fragments. The experimental results agree with the proposed multi-scale interpretation satisfactorily...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} {{three-dimensional}} discrete element modeling (DEM) {{presented in this}} paper confirm the grain size and flow volume effects on granular flow mobility that were observed in laboratory experiments where batches of granular material traveled down a curved chute. Our numerical simulations are able to predict the correct relative mobility of the granular flows because they take into account particle interactions and, thus, the energy dissipated by the flows. The results illustrated here are obtained without prior fine tuning of the parameter values to get the desired output. The grain size and flow volume effects can be expressed by a linear relationship between scaling parameters where the finer the grain size or the smaller the flow volume, the more mobile the centre of mass of the granular flows. The numerical simulations reveal also the effect of the <b>initial</b> <b>compaction</b> of the granular masses before release. The larger the <b>initial</b> <b>compaction,</b> the more mobile the centre of mass of the granular flows. Both grain size effect and compaction effect are explained by different particle agitations per unit of flow mass that cause different energy dissipations per unit of travel distance. The volume effect is explained by the backward accretion of the deposits that occurs wherever there is a change of slope (either gradual or abrupt). Our results are relevant for the understanding of the travel and deposition mechanisms of geophysical flows such as rock avalanches and pyroclastic flows...|$|E
40|$|This paper numerically {{investigates the}} seismic {{response}} of the filled joint under high amplitude stress waves using the combined finite-discrete element method (FDEM). A thin layer of independent polygonal particles are used to simulate the joint fillings. Each particle is meshed using the Delaunay triangulation scheme and can be crushed when the load exceeds its strength. The propagation of the 1 D longitude wave through a single filled joint is studied, considering the influences of the joint thickness and {{the characteristics of the}} incident wave, such as the amplitude and frequency. The results show that the filled particles under high amplitude stress waves mainly experience three deformation stages: (i) <b>initial</b> <b>compaction</b> stage; (ii) crushing stage; and (iii) crushing and compaction stage. In the <b>initial</b> <b>compaction</b> stage and crushing and compaction stage, compaction dominates the mechanical behavior of the joint, and the particle area distribution curve varies little. In these stages, the transmission coefficient increases with the increase of the amplitude, i. e., peak particle velocity (PPV), of the incident wave. On the other hand, in the crushing stage, particle crushing plays the dominant role. The particle size distribution curve changes abruptly with the PPV due to the fragments created by the crushing process. This process consumes part of wave energy and reduces the stiffness of the filled joint. The transmission coefficient decreases with increasing PPV in this stage because of the increased amount of energy consumed by crushing. Moreover, with the increase of the frequency of the incident wave, the transmission coefficient decreases and fewer particles can be crushed. Under the same incident wave, the transmission coefficient decreases when the filled thickness increases and the filled particles become more difficult to be crushed...|$|E

Several granular m aterials {{can be used for}} generation, recycling, processing and recovery of oxygen and water. For example, they may include soft bed media, e. g. ion exchange resins for oxygen generation assembly and hard bed media such as, activated alumina, magchem (Magnesium oxide) and activa ted carbon to remove organic species like ethanol, methanol, and urea from wastewater in Water recovery/processing assembly. These beds are generally packed using a plate-spring mechanism to provide sufficien t compaction to the bed media throughout the course of operation. This paper presents results from an experimental study of a full-scale, 3 8. 1 cm (15 inches) long and 3. 7 cm (1. 44 inches) diameter. activated alumina bed enclosed in a cylinder determining its force-displacement behavior, friction mobilizing force, and axial normal stress distribu tion under various axially applied loads and at different levels of packing. It is observed that force-displacement behavior is non-linear for low compaction level and becomes linear with increase in compaction of the bed media. Axial normal stress distribution {{along the length of the}} bed media decreased non-linearly with increase in depth from the loading end of the granular media. This paper also presents experimental results on the amount of particulates generated corresponding to various compaction levels. Particulates generated from each of the tests were measured using standard US sieves. It was found that the p articulates and the overall displacement of the bed media increased with decrease in <b>initial</b> <b>compaction</b> of the bed media. This effect could be attributed to the greater tendency for inter-particle sliding/rub bing due to smaller internal friction angles, as seen from the shear tests, at lesser initial compacted levels. Upon unloading, it was obse rved that there was no change in displacement (especially rebounding) in the bed media. This effect could be attributed to the fact that th e porous activated alumina particles fracture/break upon increase in applied load (during loading phase) and occupy void spaces in between the material grains; thereby leading to settling of the media. The lo ad-displacement curve becomes more linear with increase in <b>initial</b> <b>compaction</b> of the bed media. It is concluded that compaction considerabl y affects the load-displacement behavior of the bed media. A series of tests were also conducted on the packed bed media to determine the f orce required to mobilize the friction between the bed media and the housing cylinder. The results from these tests showed the existence of significant friction between the bed media and the encasing stainles s steel cylinder. Further, it was found that friction effects were more pronounced for media with higher <b>initial</b> <b>compaction.</b> Internal frict ion of the granular media was measured using direct shear apparatus. It was observed that the internal friction increased with increase in <b>initial</b> <b>compaction</b> of the bed media. In this study, a computational m odel (CM) is also developed using finite element software ANSYS to verify experimental results obtained for the distribution of the axial n ormal stress and axial displacement along the length of the full-scal e activated alumina bed media. In the computational model, the granular material is considered to have appropriate failure and frictional c ontact exists between the wall and the granular media. It is observed that the model predicts results closely with the experimental method. The compational results show that the axial normal stress distribution along the length of the activated alumina media decreases non-linea rly from the loading end and is negligible beyond a certain depth.

In this paper, a series of monotonic triaxial compression and extension tests over a wide range of density and confining pressure were conducted to determine the critical state line and study the flow liquefaction behavior. Another series of cyclic triaxial tests were conducted to study both flow liquefaction and cyclic mobility behavior of completely decomposed granite. It is found that saturated decomposed granite behaves like clean sand during undrained shearing. The intrinsic behavior of completely decomposed granite could be described within critical state framework. Flow liquefaction can be triggered by monotonic loading when state parameter is 0. 127 or cyclic loading when cyclic stress is 33 % higher than steady state strength.

Rail track upgrading should cater for high speed trains with heavier carriages, and increased traffic frequency. Consequently, increased degradation and settlement of ballast foundations are anticipated, together with higher maintenance costs. In order to minimise maintenance costs, {{a thorough understanding of}} the strength-deformation properties of ballast under static and dynamic loading is essential. Due to the relatively larger size of ballast, conventional laboratory tests often give misleading stress-strain results and failure loads (Indraratna et al., 1998).

This paper describes the strength-deformation and degradation aspects of ballast (latite basalt) in large-scale triaxial equipment. The large cylindrical triaxial apparatus (specimen size 300 mm diameter x 600 mm high) was used to test specimens under fully drained compression (static loading) at low confining pressures (10 - 200 kPa) that are typical of a conventional ballast bed. The influence of confining pressure and <b>initial</b> porosity (<b>compaction)</b> on the ultimate shear strength, angle of internal friction, dilation rate and degree of particle degradation is studied in detail.

40|$|Vacuum {{installations}} {{are currently}} used in moulding machines for flaskless {{as well as}} for flask moulding processes. The basic aim ofusing such installation is the improvement of compaction effects due to the intensification of the course of processes in the maincompaction method (eg. by shooting) or also realizing of the <b>initial</b> <b>compaction</b> before squeezing. In moulding machines using of this typeinstallations the stable and high compaction state, good imprint of difficult pattern shape are achieved. The low level of noise during the operation of such machines is also the advantage of their using. The correct selection of design and operation parameters of pneumaticmoulding machines can be easier with the modeling of air flow process in workspaces of the machine. In the article the mathematicalmodel and example-results of the air flow process simulation in the system of the stand for vacuum assisted moulding investigation havebeen presented. The simulation results were compared with measurements results of basic parameters describing the course of air flowprocess...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe small strain {{behaviour}} is a {{key indicator}} for assessing the performance of compacted fills. The <b>initial</b> <b>compaction</b> conditions i. e. water content and applied energy, govern compaction effectiveness and, thus, the structure and matric suction of compacted subgrade soil. This paper presents an experimental study of the small strain behaviour of a typical compacted subgrade soil, i. e. silty sand, prepared with different compaction conditions. Specimens were prepared for different compaction states to mimic the typical acceptance criteria of end-product specifications. The small strain modulus (G 0) was evaluated using Bender elements, while the post-compaction matric suction was measured using the filter paper method and a tensiometer. The experimental data indicates a strong modulus dependency on water content or suction across the compaction plane but suggests G 0 is better described {{as a function of}} the degree of saturation (Sr). The laboratory results are also examined in light of common end-product specifications, which show that it may be beneficial to compact the soil slightly dry of optimum moisture content from the modulus point of view...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a series of {{penetration}} experiments with cylindrical projectiles (diameter: 30 mm, length: 158 mm) of different tip geometries (hemispherical, conic and flat) impacting with approx. 380 m/s on cylindrical sand targets (diameter: 250 mm, length: 1 m) are presented. The projectiles are instrumented with an on-board data recorder system with acceleration sensor (G-Rec), allowing for in-situ measurement of the decelerations experienced during the impact and during the subsequent penetration process. During and after the acceleration stage inside the gun barrel, the velocities derived from the G-Rec data show a very good agreement with an independent reference velocity measurement obtained by a light barrier system. Immediately after the initial impact on the granular material (compacted sand for this study), the sensor signals indicate very strong amplitude oscillating decelerations in the range of 50, 000 to 80, 000 g. The measured penetration depth varied widely for identical conditions of projectile impact, using identical preparation procedures forthe sand sample. Variables considered for the experimental program included projectile tip shape, <b>initial</b> sand <b>compaction</b> state, and projectile velocity. A data reduction procedure to obtain velocity and position information of the projectile while penetrating the sand assembly is presented, taking into account a constant value (offset) observed in the raw signals of G-Rec at the end of penetration process. The formation of a false tip of agglomerated quartz powder in front of the projectile was observed in all cases. The observed shape of the false tip (penetrator tip with comminuted sand) was found to be identical for all projectile tip shapes (flat, hemispherical, and conical) considered in this study. Initial examination results of the false tip using X-ray computed tomography are presented...|$|R
40|$|Shock wave {{consolidation}} of powder {{is a high}} deformation rate process in which a shock wave generated by an explosive or a colliding projectile rapidly densifies and bonds together the powder particles into a solid compact. The deposition of the shock energy during this process is highly inhomogeneous on the powder particle scale. Evidence of the extent and pattern of the energy deposition was provided by recovery experiments performed using an initially crystalline alloy which solidifies to a metallic glass upon rapid quenching from the liquid state. The amount of metallic glass was measured and analyzed using a heat flow model. The energy deposited during the shock wave passage was best modeled as deposited partly into the particle bulk and partly onto particle surfaces. To investigate this inhomogeneity, and the powder parameters which influence it, a propellant driven gas gun was designed, built and utilized. The planarity of the shock waves produced using the targets designed for the gun was established. Powder-powder thermocouples were impacted with powders of varying sizes to establish the effect of particle size on energy deposition. Small particles in contact with large ones were inferred to absorb the greater fraction of shock energy. Hardened and unhardened steel powder was shocked to investigate the effect of particle hardness on energy distribution. The recovered compacts were not measurably affected by the <b>initial</b> hardness. <b>Compaction</b> experiments were performed on a Ni based super-alloy and on a SiC reinforced Ti matrix composite to test some of the practical applications {{of the process and}} the target designs developed. Superior tensile properties were observed in the shock consolidated and heat treated Ni based 718 alloy. The SiC reinforced composite was recovered in the intended net shape with no macro-cracks in the compact body, but with fractured SiC particles...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{swelling}} is {{a complex}} phenomenon resulting from adsorption of water {{onto the surface of}} clay platelets. It is influenced by procedural, environmental and structural factors. In particular, the initial hydration state of a soil (expressed in terms of saturation degree, water content or suction), its <b>initial</b> level of <b>compaction</b> (expressed in terms of void ratio or dry unit weight) and the level of confinement are among the influencing parameters most studied. Characterising the swelling potential of a soil in the laboratory is an extensive task and tools for prediction are somehow limited. This paper presents the first attempt to use dimensional analysis to predict the amount of soil swelling. This approach makes use of the Buckingham pi theorem to reduce an equation describing a physical phenomenon into an equation involving a reduced number of parameters, which are dimensionless. One of these numbers, called DSP w, was specifically derived and validated using datasets from the literature. These data were obtained from monotonic one-dimensional swelling tests until full saturation. The results suggest that dimensional analysis and the resulting dimensionless model can be used to predict soil swelling with relatively good accuracy...|$|R
