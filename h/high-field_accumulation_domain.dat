40|$|AbstractA {{comprehensive}} understanding of thrombus formation as a physicochemical {{process that has}} evolved to protect {{the integrity of the}} human vasculature is critical to our ability to predict and control pathological states caused by a malfunctioning blood coagulation system. Despite numerous investigations, the spatial and temporal details of thrombus growth as a multicomponent process are not fully understood. Here, we used computational modeling to investigate the temporal changes in the spatial distributions of the key enzymatic (i. e., thrombin) and structural (i. e., platelets and fibrin) components within a growing thrombus. Moreover, we investigated the interplay between clot structure and its mechanical properties, such as hydraulic resistance to flow. Our model relied on the coupling of computational fluid dynamics and biochemical kinetics, and was validated using flow-chamber data from a previous experimental study. The model allowed us to identify the distinct patterns characterizing the spatial distributions of thrombin, platelets, and fibrin accumulating within a thrombus. Our modeling results suggested that under the simulated conditions, thrombin kinetics was determined predominantly by prothrombinase. Furthermore, our simulations showed that thrombus resistance imparted by fibrin was ∼ 30 -fold higher than that imparted by platelets. Yet, thrombus-mediated bloodflow occlusion was driven primarily by the platelet deposition process, because the height of the platelet <b>accumulation</b> <b>domain</b> was approximately twice that of the fibrin <b>accumulation</b> <b>domain.</b> Fibrinogen supplementation in normal blood resulted in a nonlinear increase in thrombus resistance, and for a supplemented fibrinogen level of 48 %, the thrombus resistance increased by ∼ 2. 7 -fold. Finally, our model predicted that restoring the normal levels of clotting factors II, IX, and X while simultaneously restoring fibrinogen (to 88 % of its normal level) in diluted blood can restore fibrin generation to ∼ 78 % of its normal level and hence improve clot formation under dilution...|$|R
40|$|Solutions of a kinetic {{equation}} are investigated which describe, on a nonperturbative basis, {{the vacuum}} creation of quasiparticle electron-positron pairs {{due to a}} strong laser field. The dependence of the quasiparticle electron (positron) distribution function and the particle number density is explored {{in a wide range}} of the laser radiation parameters, i. e., the wavelength λ and amplitude of electric field strength E_ 0. Three domains are found: the domain of vacuum polarization effects where the density of the e-e+ pairs is small (the "calm valley"), and two <b>accumulation</b> <b>domains</b> in which the production rate of the e-e+ pairs is strongly increased and the e-e+ pair density can reach a significant value (the short wave length domain and the strong field one). In particular, the obtained results point to a complicated short-distance electromagnetic structure of the physical vacuum in the domain of short wavelengths λλ_acc = π/m. For moderately strong fields E_ 0 ≲ E_c=m^ 2 /e, the accumulation regime can be realized where a plasma with a high density of e-e+ quasiparticles can be achieved. In this domain of the field strengths and in the whole investigated range of wavelengths, an observation of the dynamical Schwinger effect can be facilitated.

Here we use a cellular system for monitoring messenger RNA (mRNA) expression to characterize the movement in real time of single mRNA-protein complexes (mRNPs) in the nucleus of living mammalian cells. This mobility was not directed but was governed by simple diffusion. Some mRNPs were partially corralled throughout the nonhomogenous nuclear environment, but no <b>accumulation</b> at subnuclear <b>domains</b> was observed. Following energy deprivation, energy-independent motion of mRNPs was observed in a highly ATP-dependent nuclear environment; movements were constrained to chromatin-poor domains and excluded by newly formed chromatin barriers. This observation resolves a controversy, showing that the energetic requirements of nuclear mRNP trafficking are consistent with a diffusional model...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that preprotein substrates must {{be presented in}} an unfolded state to the bacterial Sec-translocase {{in order to be}} translocated. Here, we have examined the ability of the Sec-translocase to translocate folded preproteins. Tightly folded human cardiac Ig-like domain 12 7 fused to the C terminus of proOmpA is translocated efficiently by the Sectranslocase and the translocation kinetics are determined by the extent of folding of the titin 127 <b>domain.</b> <b>Accumulation</b> of specific translocation intermediates around the fusion point that undergo translocation progress upon ATP binding suggests that the motor protein SecA plays an important and decisive role in promoting unfolding of the titin 127 domain.

40|$|The structuralist {{theory of}} truth {{approximation}} essen- tially deals with truth approximation by theory revision for a fixed domain. However, variable domains {{can also be}} taken into account, where the main changes concern domain extensions and restrictions. In this paper I will present a coherent set of definitions of “more truth- likeness”, “empirical progress” and “truth approximation” due to a revision of the domain of intended applications. This set of definitions {{seems to be the}} natural counterpart of the basic definitions of similar notions as far as theory revision is concerned. The formal aspects of theory revision strongly suggest an analogy between truth approx- imation and design research, for example, drug research. Whereas a new drug may be better for a certain disease than an old one, a certain drug may be better for another disease than for the original target disease, a phenomenon which was nicely captured by the title of a study by Rein Vos [1991]: Drugs Looking for Diseases. Similarly, truth approximation may not only take the shape of theory revision but also of domain revision, naturally suggesting the phenomenon of “Theories looking for domains”. However, whereas Vos documented his title with a number of examples, so far, apart from plausible cases of “truth <b>accumulation</b> by <b>domain</b> extension”, I did not find clear-cut empirical instantiations of the analogy, only, as such, very interesting, non-empirical examples. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Protein domains are the {{structural}} and functional units of proteins. The ability to parse proteins into different domains {{is important for}} effective classification, understanding of protein structure, function, and evolution and is hence biologically relevant. Several computational methods are available to identify domains in the sequence. Domain finding algorithms often employ stringent thresholds to recognize sequence domains. Identification of additional domains can be tedious involving intense computation and manual intervention but can lead to better understanding of overall biological function. In this context, the problem of identifying new domains in the unassigned regions of a protein sequence assumes a crucial importance. Results We had earlier demonstrated that <b>accumulation</b> of <b>domain</b> information of sequence homologues can substantially aid prediction of new domains. In this paper, we propose a computationally intensive, multi-step bioinformatics protocol as a web server named as PURE (P rediction of U nassigned RE gions in proteins) for the detailed examination of stretches of unassigned regions in proteins. Query sequence is processed using different automated filtering steps based on length, presence of coiled-coil regions, transmembrane regions, homologous sequences and percentage of secondary structure content. Later, the filtered sequence segments and their sequence homologues are fed to PSI-BLAST, cd-hit and Hmmpfam. Data from the various programs are integrated and information regarding the probable domains predicted from the sequence is reported. Conclusion We have implemented PURE protocol as a web server for rapid and comprehensive analysis of unassigned regions in the proteins. This server integrates data from different programs and provides information about the domains encoded in the unassigned regions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Histone H 1 accumulates in {{the nucleus}} after {{injection}} into the cytoplasm of Xenopus oocytes. A proteolytic fragment of 89 amino acids encompassing the carboxy-terminal domain also accumulates in the nucleus. Lysine, alanine and proline compose 84 % of this <b>domain.</b> <b>Accumulation</b> {{is not due}} solely to the high lysine content since poly-L-lysine does not accumulate in the nucleus when injected into the cytoplasm of Xenopus oocytes. Proteolytic fragments encompassing other domains of the molecule are degraded in the oocyte after injection. In these instances degradation is more rapid in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus giving the false impression of accumulation in the nucleus, an artefact {{which is likely to}} confuse other studies of protein migration. Susceptibility to rapid degradation is a dominant feature, thus the globular domain destabilises the contiguous carboxy-terminal domain. The properties of the carboxy-terminal domain of H 1 and the possible involvement of the amino acids lysine, proline and alanine in migration are discussed and compared with those of a domain that specifies migration of nucleoplasmin into the oocyte nucleus...|$|R
40|$|We are {{pursuing}} {{a new class}} of solid-state devices capable of generating highfrequency radiation: short ballistic semiconductor diodes in which the current flow is due to carriers injected into a negative-effective-mass (NEM) region of dispersion [1]. The resulting radiation is tunable by the source-drain voltage applied to the diode and device operation does not require magnetic fields or pumping by other oscillators. The physical mechanism responsible for high-frequency oscillation generation in such diodes lies in the instability of the ballistic NEM carrier quasineutral plasma, which forms in a large fraction of the diode base and stratifies into <b>accumulation</b> and depletion <b>domains.</b> As in the Gunn diode, where the instability arises from intervalley carrier transfer, the domains travel from source to drain and give rise to current oscillations. However, in short ballistic diodes the source-drain distance Ä can be much smaller than in a Gunn diode; numerical simulations show that for Ä � 0. 2 �m the ballistic transport of the domains can lead to current oscillations in the THz frequency range [2]. The implementation of such ballistic diodes requires two essential ingredients...|$|R
40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that HAI- 2 is able to suppress carcinogenesis induced by overexpression of matriptase, as well as cause regression of individual established tumors in a mouse model system. However, the role of HAI- 2 is poorly understood. In the present study we describe three mutations in the binding loop of the HAI- 2 Kunitz domain 1 (K 42 N, C 47 F, and R 48 L) that cause a delay in the SEA domain cleavage of matriptase, leading to <b>accumulation</b> of non-SEA <b>domain</b> cleaved matriptase in the ER. We suggest that, like other known SEA domains, the matriptase SEA domain auto-cleaves and reflects that correct oligomerization, maturation, and/or folding has been obtained. Our {{results suggest that the}} HAI- 2 Kunitz domain 1 mutants influence the flux of matriptase to the plasma membrane by affecting the oligomerization, maturation, and/or folding of matriptase, and as a result the SEA domain cleavage of matriptase. Two of the HAI- 2 Kunitz domain 1 mutants investigated (C 47 F, R 48 L, C 47 F/R 48 L) also displayed a reduced ability to proteolytically silence matriptase. Hence, HAI- 2 separately stabilizes matriptase, regulates the secretory transport, possibly via maturation/oligomerization, and inhibits the proteolytic activity of matriptase in the ER, and possible throughout the secretory pathway...|$|R
40|$|Ternary lipid {{mixtures}} {{composed of}} cholesterol, saturated (frequently with sphingosine backbone), and unsaturated phospholipids show stable phase separation {{and are often}} used as model systems of lipid rafts. Yet, their ability to reproduce raft properties and function is still debated. We investigated the properties and functional aspects of three lipid raft model systems of varying degrees of biological relevance – PSM/POPC/Chol, DPPC/POPC/Chol, and DPPC/DOPC/Chol – using 2 H solidstate nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. While some minor differences were observed, the general behavior and properties of all three model mixtures were similar to previously investigated influenza envelope lipid membranes, which closely mimic the lipid composition of biological membranes. For {{the investigation of the}} functional aspects, we employed the human N-Ras protein, which is posttranslationally modified by two lipid modifications that anchor the protein to the membrane. It was previously shown that N-Ras preferentially resides in liquid-disordered domains and exhibits a time-dependent <b>accumulation</b> in the <b>domain</b> boundaries of influenza envelope lipid membranes. For all three model mixtures, we observed the same membrane partitioning behavior for N-Ras. Therefore, we conclude that even relatively simple models of raft membranes are able to reproduce many of their specific properties and functions...|$|R

Registries list, identify and localize Internet resources and cross-reference them with their owners. They help individuals, companies and organizations to keep track of more information and people, not just from within an organization but, increasingly, among organizations over the Internet. Since the most relevant and profitable domain names are becoming rare and investors are starting to see the value in the <b>accumulation</b> of a <b>Domain</b> Name Portfolio, several markets have started gaining momentum as a means for investors to make a profit from their Domains.

Due to this increasing relevance, this paper will analyze one of the two types of domain names transactions on the secondary market—re-acquisition of dropped domain names. The analysis will be based on data that was collected over a period of 2 years from the registrant name servers databases, namely, the number of dropped domains, the number of re-registered dropped domains and the total number of re-registrations during a certain period of time. Besides the analysis of general trends, re-registered domains are also analyzed in terms of the characters they contain and their Google and Alexa ranks, creating a knowledge base that can help us understand which are the main factors that influence the re-registration of a certain domain name...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} the variable ocular phenotype {{associated with a}} heterozygous mutation in the BEST 1 gene. METHODS: Clinical and genetic assessment was performed in {{five members of the}} same family. Molecular genetic analysis of the BEST 1 gene was performed by direct sequencing. Extensive ophthalmic examination included color fundus imaging, spectral domain optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence, electro-oculography (EOG), and full-field electroretinography (ERG). The main outcome measures were BEST 1 mutations, imaging, and electroretinography findings. RESULTS: All affected family members carried a single heterozygous c. 614 T>C (p. I 205 T) mutation in exon 5 of the BEST 1 gene. The 46 -year-old proband showed nanophthalmos with chorioretinal atrophy in the macula, extensive coarse hyperpigmentation in the (mid) peripheral retina with tractional vitreous strands. Full-field ERG revealed nonrecordable cone and rod responses, and EOG showed an absent light rise. The daughter and son of the proband showed a phenotype resembling autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy, including short axial lengths, cystoid fluid collections, and shallow serous subretinal fluid <b>accumulation</b> on spectral <b>domain</b> optical coherence tomography throughout the macula in combination with mild retinal pigment epithelium changes. The son of the proband also showed subretinal yellowish deposits inferiorly in the macula as well as outside the temporal vascular arcade, that were hyperfluorescent on fundus autofluorescence, similar to those seen in autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy. Full-field ERG revealed a reduced rod and cone response and a markedly reduced or absent EOG light peak in both brother and sister of the proband. CONCLUSION: The clinical spectrum of bestrophinopathy may encompass severe ocular phenotypes that affect the development and function of the entire eye. A clinical picture similar to autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy can also be caused by a single heterozygous mutation in the BEST 1 gene, such as the c. 614 T>C (p. I 205 T) variant in this family...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} model {{based on the}} finite element method is {{presented in this paper}} to describe transient changes in the hydraulic properties of porous media due to bioclogging in the pore space. Physical processes like ground water flow and delivery of nutrients in the domain are considered through the coupling of the Richards equation and the convection-diffusion equation. Biomass growth dynamics is described by the mathematical model defined by the Monod equation. Four theoretical relationships available in the literature are used to estimate the change in hydraulic conductivity due to biomass <b>accumulation</b> in the <b>domain.</b> Variations in the model’s predictions due to uncertainty in the Monod coefficients (yield factor, half velocity constant, maximum substrate use rate) are assessed through a sensitivity analysis. The model is validated against results from sand column experiments performed using the bacterium Beijerinckia indica. The columns were prepared with a defined initial concentration of bacteria and are subjected to periods of nutrient supply and periods of rest without flow. The columns’ effective hydraulic conductivity was determined using a constant head test across the column. Preliminary numerical results are in agreement with the literature showing that bacteria tend to reproduce more readily in nutrient injection points causing reductions in hydraulic conductivity in these regions due to biomass accumulation. The combination of increased biomass content (and corresponding nutrient consumption) and reduction of hydraulic conductivity prevents further flow downstream limiting the growth and possibly increasing the decay of bacteria in those sections of the domain. The effective hydraulic conductivity estimated using coefficient values readily available in the literature and others obtain from ongoing experiments at Cardiff University for the hydraulic conductivity models considered here show noticeable differences attributed to the underlying assumptions in their theoretical formulations. However, one model allows for a good comparison between the numerical results and the experimental measurements thus proving the validity of the mathematical model here proposed. A sensitivity analysis shows a relatively strong dependency on the yield coefficient, followed by the maximum substrate use rate and a negligible effect of the half velocity constant. Further work is ongoing to increase the accuracy of these parameters for the case of B. indica...|$|R
40|$|Several {{extensions}} to {{the phase}} behavior of binary polymer blends were investigated. Complicated and intricate phase diagrams {{were found in}} ternary block copolymer/homopolymer blends as microphase separation competes with macrophase separation. Composition fluctuations were accounted for in the Hartree approximation and the phase diagrams are an extension to mean-field theory. The Lifshitz point, a mean-field multicritical point at the boundary between macrophase separation and microphase separation, is destroyed by the inclusion of composition fluctuations. The kinetics of phase separation in ternary block copolymer/homopolymer mixtures was modeled using the time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg (TDGL) theory calculating the expansion coefficients from molecular parameters. The expulsion of diblock copolymers from the interior of developing <b>domains</b> and subsequent <b>accumulation</b> at the <b>domain</b> interfaces was observed. The simulations suggest that for higher block copolymer content saturation of the interface with block copolymer {{is responsible for the}} formation of separate copolymer-rich domains at later stages. Since the diblock copolymer acts as a compatibilizer between the two homopolymers, phase separation kinetics are slowed down. In order to study the viscoelastic effect of polymers, phase contrast optical microscopy and time-resolved small-angle light scattering was used to study the relaxation behavior of a high molecular weight polybutadiene/polyisoprene. Upon the cessation of steady-state shear anisotropic morphologies relaxed by a variety of ways depending on the previously applied shear rate. Application of sufficiently high shear rates resulted in the fastest relaxation of the anisotropy. After passing through a dynamic scaling regime, the largest domains were formed. The TDGL formalism with a convective flow was used to simulate such relaxation behavior. By incorporating only surface tension some of the basic features of the relaxation behavior were recovered. Finally the phase separation in a binary blend in the vicinity of a patterned surface was studies using the TDGL equation. For a short range potential long-range “checkerboard-like” oscillations normal to the surface were observed as transient states, the extension of which strongly depended on the noise. Spinodal decomposition is observed for films as thin as one spinodal wavelength. For thinner films the surface imposes its periodicity on the blend if the surface interaction is sufficiently strong. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was the {{creation}} of artificial receptors at the plant cell membrane that were capable of binding extra cellular molecules and transporting them into the plant cell through the endocytic pathway. This would then create the basis for a novel mechanism for the phyto-remediation of environmental contaminants using transgenic plants. The artificial receptor was created by exchanging the native binding domain of the polymeric Ig receptor for a single chain antibody fragment (scFv 29) specific for a small peptide epitope. In this configuration, the scFv 29 -pIgR fusion protein contained a endocytosis signal in its cytoplasmic domain. This endocytosis signal is highly potent in mammalian cells and to investigate its role in plant cells, a second fusion protein was created where the endocytosis signal was made defective by amno acid replacement (scFv 29 -pIgRmut). as a further control, a fusion protein was created between the scFv 29 and the constant, trans membrane and cytoplasmic domain of the beta-chain of the human T-cell receptor, which possesses no signalling information in the cytoplasmic domain. These receptors were stably expressed in both tobacco plants and tobacco cell suspension cultures (BY- 2 cultures). A functional ELISA measured the accumulation of the fusion proteins through quantitation of the concentration of the scFv 29 <b>domain.</b> <b>Accumulation</b> levels were high in the leaves and roots of transgenic plants, indicating that the fusion proteins found in the roots could potentially be used to bind extra cellular molecules. Further analysis in-vitro demonstrated that the receptor fusion protein was intact and capable of binding to be specific peptide recognised by the single chain antibody. Immuno-fluorescence confocal microscopy was used to determine the sub-cellular localization of the artificial receptors. The scFv 29 -pIgR fusion protein was found to be at the plasma membrane of suspension cell protoplasts and was found in intra-cellular vesicles. The intra-cellular location of the artificial receptor was explained by the presence of the functional endocytosis signal in the cytoplasmic tail, for the version of the receptor lacking the endocytosis signal was found exclusively at the plasma membrane. The control T-cell receptor based fusion protein was found at the plasma membrane {{as well as in the}} endoplasmic reticulum. Immuno-electron microscopy was used to identify the intra-cellular vesicles as endocytic multi-vesicular bodies. Furthermore, electron microscopy demonstrated that the receptor was correctly orientated in the membrane with the single chain antibody domain facing outward. In order to assess whether the artificial receptors were capable of binding extra-cellular molecules in vivo, a green fluorescent protein was produced fused to the target peptide epitope recognized by the single chain antibody incorporated into the artificial receptors. It was shown that this protein bound to the cell surface of tobacco cell lines or plant root hairs expressing the artificial receptors when it was added to the extra-cellular medium. The Labeled fluorescent protein was only endocytosed significantly in cells expressing the scFv 29 -pIgR construct where there was an endocytosis signal in the cytoplasmic tail. Therefore, this thesis work demonstrated the feasibility of assembling and expressing artificial receptors in plant cells. Secondly, it showed that these receptors were expressed at the cell surface where they could bind extra-cellular molecules. The uptake of these molecules was enhanced by the presence of an endocytosis signal in the cytoplasmic domain of the artificial receptor showing that the plant cell endocytic apparatus recognizes this signal and that it can be co-opted for uptake of artificial receptors carrying molecules from the extra-cellular environment. The thesis demonstrates that this approach may be of interest for creating plants that are capable of removing pollutants from the environment...|$|R
