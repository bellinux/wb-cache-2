[...] The produced oil {{was transferred to the}} tanker Polysaga. Polysaga had a storage capacity of up to 160,000 cu meters of oil. It was moored and loaded by the subsea turret loading system (STL). The oil from Polysaga was offloaded to a shuttle tanker and transported to the Statoil Mongstad terminal near Bergen for final processing and <b>fiscal</b> <b>metering.</b> Mongstad had to upgrade its desalters {{in order to be able}} to handle the Yme crude.

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{can often}} learn much from manufacturing {{in terms of}} available analysis techniques, from basic time series analysis through to fuzzy and knowledge based systems and artificial intelligence. On the other hand, manufacturing in many sectors {{has yet to make}} use of energy data much beyond finance. Techniques such as complex event processing and data stream analysis can be applied in near real time to determine process health. Conventional energy data, with a half-hourly time interval through <b>fiscal</b> <b>metering,</b> has been sufficient for off-line process control in the past, but to increase the utility of manufacturing energy data, a step change is needed in data frequency, accuracy, precision, portability, and documentation. This paper brings together co-dependent issues of data structure, data quality, and front-end instrumentation which advanced processing techniques must build on, discussing what must be done to use gather and use energy data more effectively, to reduce energy use and emissions, improve quality, and save costs...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic {{gas flow}} meters (USMs) may be {{influenced}} by pressure and temperature in several ways. Change of the meter body's cross-sectional area (the "pipe bore") influences directly on the amount of gas flowing through the meter. Change of the ultrasonic path geometry (i. e. change of the inclination angles and lateral chord positions, caused by e. g. meter body diameter change and change of the orientation of the ultrasonic transducer ports) influences on the transit times and the numerical integration method of the meter. Change of the Reynolds number influences on the integration method. Change of the length of the ultrasonic transducer ports influences on the acoustic path lengths, and thus on the transit times. Likewise, change of the length of the ultrasonic transducers influences on the acoustic path lengths, and thus on the transit times. In addition, changes of the transducer properties such as the directivity, influences on the diffraction correction, and thus on the transit times. Some of these issues are addressed to some extent in current draft standards for such meters, such as the AGA- 9 (1998) report, and the ISO/CD 17089 - 1 (August 2007). Other of these effects have not been described or treated in the literature. In the present paper, pressure and temperature effects have been investigated for 18 " Elster-Instromet Q-Sonic 5 ultrasonic flow meters (USMs) to be operated in the Ormen Lange <b>fiscal</b> <b>metering</b> system at Nyhamna in Møre and Romsdal...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} combat the climate change caused by {{increasing}} emissions of CO 2 from industrial processes, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies have been accepted worldwide to address these pressing global warming concerns. So as to efficiently manage material and financial losses across the entire stream, accurate accounting and monitoring through <b>fiscal</b> <b>metering</b> of CO 2 in CCS transportation pipelines are core and required features for the deployment of CCS technologies. Moreover, these technical requirements {{are part of the}} legal compliance schemes and guidelines from various regulatory bodies. This thesis reports experimental studies of two different metering technologies, an Averaging Pitot Tube (APT) and a Coriolis mass flowmeter (CMF), for CO 2 flow measurement, together with the design and implementation of a CO 2 flow calibration facility. A prototype system for the leak detection of the gas phase of CO 2 is also developed. A review of the methodologies and technologies for the flow measurement and leak detection of CO 2 gas is firstly given, followed by the discussion of the main challenges and technical requirements in their applications. Based on this review, two flow metering technologies, APT and CMF, are selected for experimental studies and a calibration platform using both volumetric and direct mass measurement methods for the gas phase of CO 2 is also developed. The APT and CMF were calibrated and evaluated in the test facility. Experimental results obtained in this test facility demonstrate that the instruments are capable of accurately metering gaseous CO 2 within a measurement uncertainty of ± 1. 5...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} connectorized, subsea fiber-optic data link was {{installed}} on the Phillips “Little Dotty ” field in January of 1997, the subsea oil industry has seen a number of projects, where optical fiber has been either critical to the program or has offered significant cost or performance advantages. These projects {{have been at the}} forefront of recent tieback technology development, and have been as diverse as the Norsk Hydro Troll Pilot subsea separation system and the Petrobras SBMS multiphase pump project, to new downhole gauges with remote, real time monitoring, such as the Shell ETAP program. Many of these projects have already been installed or are scheduled for phased installation over the next year or two. Optical fiber has been critical to these programs for a variety of reasons, ranging from data security for <b>fiscal</b> <b>metering</b> subsea through communication bandwidth and electrical noise immunity, to CAPEX reduction for Integrated Service Umbilicals for very deep-water installation (> 2000 m). Many of the goals for the tieback community can be achieved only with the aid of fiber-optic communication. Long step-out distances, or eventually tieback to shore, can benefit from fiber’s unrepeated communication distances of greater than 100 km. High-power, subsea pumps needed to pressure boost fluids over these step-out distances need electrical noise immunity, inherent in optical fiber. Umbilicals designed for long step-outs can be more cost efficient using optical fiber in high-density, small cable designs. While the control systems for complex subsea installations need increased bandwidth, which can easily be supplied by optical fiber, while wet-mate hybrid connectors allow modular installation...|$|E
40|$|To {{combat the}} growing {{emissions}} of CO 2 from industrial processes, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Carbon Capture and Utilization technologies (CCU) {{have been accepted}} worldwide to address these pressing concerns. So as to efficiently manage material and financial losses across the entire stream, accurate accounting and monitoring through <b>fiscal</b> <b>metering</b> of CO 2 in CCS transportation pipelines are core and required features for the CCS technologies. Moreover, these technical requirements {{are part of the}} legal compliance schemes and guidelines from various regulatory bodies. The CO 2 transportation pipelines will likely have multiple inputs from different capture plants, each with varying composition of CO 2 and thus introducing impurities into the CO 2 stream. The presence of other ordinary or hydrocarbon gases in the CO 2 gas stream could affect the functionality of metering instruments by introducing additional errors, particularly in the case of volumetric flowmeters. In this study, volumetric and direct mass measurement methods for the flow measurement of CO 2 mixtures using two totally different metering principles are experimentally evaluated. An Averaging Pitot Tube with Flow Conditioning Wing (APT-FCW) and Coriolis mass flowmeters (CMF) are used to assess the flow metering of CO 2 in a binary gaseous mixture. Different gases (nitrogen, air, oxygen, argon and propane) are diluted as contaminants into the pure CO 2 gas flow for various mass fractions to produce an adulterated mixture of the CO 2 gas. Comparative analysis of the measurement results under these flow conditions relative to that of pure CO 2 gas show that the measurement error of the APT-FCW sensor increases with the mass fraction of the diluent component, and gases with density closer to that of CO 2 have a much lesser effect on the performance of the APT-FCW flow sensor for smaller mass fractions. The CMF proved to be very reliable in the gas combination processes and as a reference meter for the APT-FCW sensor. Further analytical observations are discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|Support and Training for an Excellent Energy Efficiency Performance” is a 3 -year European project helping over 600 European cross-sector {{small and}} medium sized {{enterprises}} (SMEs) to reduce their energy use and become more energy-efficient. Companies participating in STEEEP benefit from tailored training and guidance on effective energy management tools and best practices provided by an established network of energy advisors from Chambers of Commerce and Industry (CCIs) in 10 different countries. SMEs in many EU countries employ over 90 % of the workforce, so improving the energy efficiency of EU SMEs is therefore compelling, with clear advantages for the European economy. Energy efficiency in SMEs previously received less attention than in larger companies, the public sector and dwellings. Previously, policymakers had little energy (and related) data for SMEs, making prioritising ways to support energy conservation difficult. In addition staffing resources and knowledge levels within SMEs frequently determine the level of commitment to energy efficiency and implementing EU energy and climate policy, with a dedicated or even part time energy manager for many SMEs a rarity. The STEEEP project aims to help this by introducing training to SMEs via CCIs, and monitoring savings and providing feedback to SMEs. Crucial to this is the benchmarking of energy use: Basic data about the SMEs, the SME’s energy consumption, and information about the SME policies and procedures relating to energy were gathered form each of the over 600 participants. Managing these data is a considerable task, notably in several languages, using combinations of numeric, free text and other data, gathered through questionnaires. It is not merely <b>fiscal</b> <b>metering</b> data, and supporting information that are gathered, we ask for from occupancy, to building types, and to complete the energy management matrix. We describe how this is done; the data processing. survey design, initial data gathering, benchmarking, and database architecture. Energy use is gathered as the project progresses, with interventions and changes captured. This paper describes the methods used and presents lessons learnt. This include the process of collecting, storing and analyzing the data from over 600 SMEs in 10 different countries. It identifies how barriers were overcome and how information from the data collection is being used by Chambers of Commerce and Industry to help reduce energy use of SME...|$|E
