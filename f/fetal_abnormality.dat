The US guidelines recommend omitting PZA when treating TB {{in pregnancy}}; the UK and WHO guidelines make no such recommendation, and PZA is commonly used in pregnancy. There is extensive experience with the treatment of pregnant women with TB and no toxic effect of PZA in pregnancy has ever been found. High doses of RMP (much higher than used in humans) causes neural tube defects in animals, but no such effect has ever been found in humans.

It is prudent to advise all women of child-bearing age to avoid getting pregnant until TB treatment is completed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{issue of}} {{abortion}} {{is a matter of}} contention within the ELCA. In a Social Statement adopted in 1991, the church set out its position on the matter as follows. The ELCA describes itself as [...] "a community supportive of life," [...] and encourages women to explore alternatives to abortion such as adoption. However, the Social Statement asserts that there are certain circumstances under which a decision to end a pregnancy can be [...] "morally responsible." [...] These include cases where the pregnancy [...] "presents a clear threat to the physical life of the woman," [...] situations where [...] "the pregnancy occurs when both parties do not participate willingly in sexual intercourse," [...] and [...] "circumstances of extreme <b>fetal</b> <b>abnormality,</b> which will result in severe suffering and very early death of an infant." [...] Regardless of the reason, the ELCA opposes abortion when [...] "a fetus is developed enough to live outside a uterus with the aid of reasonable and necessary technology." [...] The ELCA opposes [...] "laws that deny access to safe and affordable services for morally justifiable abortions," [...] and [...] "laws that are primarily intended to harass those contemplating or deciding for an abortion." [...] The statement emphasizes the prevention of circumstances leading to abortion, specifically encouraging [...] "appropriate forms of sex education in schools, community pregnancy prevention programs, and parenting preparation classes." [...] In 2000, the Cooperative Clergy Study Project found that one fifth of ELCA clergy favored banning abortion with a constitutional amendment.|$|E

50|$|The Act made {{abortion}} {{legal in}} all of Great Britain (but not Northern Ireland) up to 24 weeks' gestation.

50|$|Changes to the Abortion Act 1967 were {{introduced}} in Parliament through the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.

Restrictions were removed for late abortions in cases of risk to life, <b>fetal</b> <b>abnormality,</b> or grave physical and mental injury to the woman.

50|$|At GRMH, Professor Donald and Dr James Willocks then refined their {{techniques}} to obstetric applications including fetal head measurement {{to assess the}} size and growth of the fetus. With {{the opening of the}} new Queen Mother's Hospital in Yorkhill in 1964, it became possible to improve these methods even further. Dr Stuart Campbell's pioneering work on fetal cephalometry led to it acquiring long-term status as the definitive method of study of foetal growth. As the technical quality of the scans was further developed, it soon became possible to study pregnancy from start to finish and diagnose its many complications such as multiple pregnancy, <b>fetal</b> <b>abnormality</b> and placenta praevia. Diagnostic ultrasound has since been imported into practically every other area of medicine.|$|E

5000|$|In May 2011, Perry {{signed a}} [...] "Mandatory Ultrasound Bill" [...] which {{stipulates}} that, prior to every abortion, the abortion practitioner or a certified sonographer must perform a sonogram before any sedative or anesthesia is administered. Before every abortion, the abortion practitioner must give {{an explanation of}} the sonogram images of the unborn child. The woman has the right to waive the explanation only in cases of rape, incest, <b>fetal</b> <b>abnormality,</b> and judicial bypass for a minor. The abortion practitioner must also allow the woman to see the sonogram images of the unborn child and hear the heartbeat along with a verbal explanation of the heartbeat before an abortion can be administered. Critics stated that the law was [...] "government intrusion", pointing out that in the first trimester, only transvaginal sonograms (in which a probe is inserted up the woman's vagina) can be performed, and stated that such a procedure would be inappropriate for victims of incest or rape, which the law does not exempt.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{controversy}} {{arose in}} March 2016 when Pence {{signed into law}} H.B. 1337, a bill that both banned certain abortion procedures and placed new restrictions on abortion providers. The bill banned abortion if {{the reason for the}} procedure given by the pregnant person was the fetus' race or gender or a <b>fetal</b> <b>abnormality.</b> In addition, the bill required that all fetal remains from abortions or miscarriages at any stage of pregnancy be buried or cremated, which according to the Guttmacher Institute was not required in any other state. The law was described as [...] "exceptional for its breadth"; if implemented, it would have made Indiana [...] "the first state to have a blanket ban on abortions based solely on race, sex or suspected disabilities, including evidence of Down syndrome." [...] Days after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction blocking the bill from taking effect, with U.S. District Judge Tanya Walton Pratt determining that the bill was likely to be unconstitutional and that the State of Indiana would be unlikely to prevail at trial. As Vice President, Pence became the highest level government official to attend the March For Life Rally in Washington D.C on January 27, 2017.|$|E
