40|$|Political {{conversation}} {{is a critical}} component to a healthy public sphere and a functioning democracy. In modern times, political conversation primarily happens {{with friends and family}} often {{within the confines of the}} home, depriving the public sphere of a critical component. On the internet, there exist spaces devoted to political, public discussion. The question is, why do people visit these online <b>discussion</b> <b>spaces</b> to talk politics? Interviews conducted with 69 people who participated on one of three <b>discussion</b> <b>spaces,</b> Usenet, Yahoo 2 ̆ 7 s chat, and Yahoo 2 ̆ 7 s message boards, provided insight into what motivates people to talk politics online. The interviews suggest that people use these <b>discussion</b> <b>spaces</b> because they do not feel comfortable having the same kinds of political conversations offline. That is, political talk with acquaintances and strangers is uncomfortable, and it is so for a number of reasons. Political talk invites disagreement. Disagreement violates the pact of civility that dictates social relations with people who are unfamiliar with each other. Political talk reveals something of the private self, which is avoided with unfamiliar others. Online, the social norms that discourage political conversation are mitigated by the channel characteristics of the medium. Because the political conversations are textual, the social cues people normally use to judge others 2 ̆ 7 reactions are absent, enabling those who use the <b>discussion</b> <b>spaces</b> to feel more anonymous and less socially present in the discussion. This allows people to express their true political opinions. The <b>discussion</b> <b>spaces</b> bring people together who are diverse in geography and political ideology, calling into being a genuine public in which people can express their opinions and survey the opinions of others. A large probability sample of people was also surveyed to determine whether the same people who talk politics online do so offline. Survey results suggest people who talk politics with friends and family and acquaintances are different from those who talk online, and that the same people who talk politics online are distinct from those who choose to talk with friends and family and with acquaintances. This research suggests, thus, that there are “new voices” in the public sphere. ...|$|R

50|$|Although ATHEMOO was {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} <b>discussion</b> <b>space</b> the creator realised its potential as a performative arena for the use and proliferation of online interactive performance. Audience members and any participants in a performance would be invited to visit the website {{at a time when}} the performance starts. Once the performance has started the actors playing a role within the performance space in ATHEMOO exist both within the virtual and physical world, thus creating two simultaneous performances.

Originally ATHEMOO was designed so that all of the online open areas looked like a Hotel Lobby. At the time of ATHEMOOs establishment there were over 2200 members of ATHE, half of which were earning under $20,000 a year; it was therefore decided at the ATHE conference in 1993 that ATHEMOO would be created to help all members discuss and learn from the ATHE conferences.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Our {{research}} aims at {{understanding the}} various forms of participation in Open Source Software (OSS) design, seen as distributed design in online spaces of actions- discussion, implementation and boundary between these spaces. We propose a methodology- based on situated analyses of a formal design process used in the Python project- to identify the distribution of actual roles (implementation, interactive, group and design oriented) performed by participants into and between the spaces (defining boundary spaces). This notion of roles is grounded in collaborative design activities performed online by participants. This way, our findings complete the core-periphery model of participation in OSS. Concerning the distribution of roles between spaces, we reveal a map of participation in OSS: the majority of participants are pure discussants but all participants in the implementation spaces do also act in the <b>discussion</b> <b>space</b> and only few participants act at boundary spaces. Concerning the distribution of roles between participants in the <b>discussion</b> <b>space,</b> we reveal that interactions are structured by a central hub (occupied by keyparticipants) and that, whereas design-oriented roles are spread among all participants, grouporiented roles are performed by one or two participants in the respective spaces and at their boundary. Finally, combination of roles reveals five individual profiles performed by participants...|$|E
