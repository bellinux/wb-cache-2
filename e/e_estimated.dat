40|$|Abstract Background As Anopheles funestus {{is one of}} the {{principal}} Afro-tropical malaria vectors, a more complete understanding of its population structure is desirable. In West and Central Africa, An. funestus population structure is complicated by the coexistence of two assortatively mating chromosomal forms. Effective population size (N e) is a key parameter in understanding patterns and levels of intraspecific variation, as it reflects the role of genetic drift. Here, N <b>e</b> was <b>estimated</b> from both chromosomal forms, Kiribina and Folonzo, in Burkina Faso. Methods Short-term N <b>e</b> was <b>estimated</b> by evaluating variation at 16 microsatellite loci across temporal samples collected annually from 2000 – 2002. Estimates were based on standardized variance in allele frequencies or a maximum likelihood method. Long-term N <b>e</b> was <b>estimated</b> from genetic diversity estimates using mtDNA sequences and microsatellites. Results For both forms, short-term and long-term N <b>e</b> <b>estimates</b> were on the order of 10 3 and 10 5, respectively. Long-term N <b>e</b> <b>estimates</b> were larger when based on loci from chromosome 3 R (both inside and outside of inversions) than loci outside of this arm. Conclusion N e values indicate that An. funestus is not subject to seasonal bottlenecks. Though not statistically different because of large and overlapping confidence intervals, short-term N <b>e</b> <b>estimates</b> were consistently smaller for Kiribina than Folonzo, possibly due to exploitation of different breeding sites: permanent for Folonzo and intermittent for Kiribina. The higher long-term N <b>e</b> <b>estimates</b> on 3 R, the arm carrying the two inversions mainly responsible for defining the chromosomal forms, give natural selection broader scope and merit further study. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Content-based image {{retrieval}} (CBIR) {{with global}} features is notori-ously noisy, especially for image queries with low percentages of relevant images in a collection. Moreover, CBIR typically ranks the whole collection, which is inefficient for large databases. We experiment with {{a method for}} image retrieval from multimodal databases, which improves both the effectiveness and efficiency of traditional CBIR by exploring secondary modalities. We perform retrieval in a two-stage fashion: first rank by a secondary modality, and then perform CBIR only on the top-K items. Thus, effectiveness is improved by performing CBIR on a ‘better ’ subset. Using a relatively ‘cheap ’ first stage, efficiency is also im-proved via the fewer CBIR operations performed. Our main novelty is that K is dynamic, i. <b>e.</b> <b>estimated</b> per query to optimize a predefined effectiveness measure. We show that such dynamic two-stage setups can be significantly more effective and robust than similar setups with static thresholds previously proposed. ...|$|E
40|$|Black-Gloss Ware artifacts, {{unearthed}} at the Phoenician-Punic site of Motya (Sicily, Italy), {{dating back}} {{from the end of}} 6 th to the early 4 th century BC, have been investigated. Mineralogical, petrographical and chemical characterization has been performed to elucidate the technological aspects, to distinguish locally manufactured pottery from those imported and to provide information on raw materials used for their production. A multi-analytical approach based on optical microscopy, mu-Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction investigations has been used. Results show that the internal body is composed of quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase feldspar, pyroxene, mica, gehlenite and hematite. In addition, magnetite, hercynite and amorphous carbon occur in the black gloss.

40|$|Background Because {{cannabis}} use {{is associated}} with social, physical and psychological problems, {{it is important to}} know what causes some individuals to initiate cannabis use and a subset of those to become problematic users. Previous twin studies found evidence for both genetic and environmental influences on vulnerability, but due to considerable variation in the results it is difficult to draw clear conclusions regarding the relative magnitude of these influences. Methods A systematic literature search identified 28 twin studies on cannabis use initiation and 24 studies on problematic cannabis use. The proportion of total variance accounted for by genes (A), shared environment (C) and unshared environment (E) in (i) initiation of cannabis use and (ii) problematic cannabis use was calculated by averaging corresponding A, C and <b>E</b> <b>estimates</b> across studies from independent cohorts and weighting by sample size. Results For cannabis use initiation, A, C and <b>E</b> <b>estimates</b> were 48 %, 25 % and 27 % in males and 40 %, 39 % and 21 % in females. For problematic cannabis use A, C and <b>E</b> <b>estimates</b> were 51 %, 20 % and 29 % for males and 59 %, 15 % and 26 % for females. Confidence intervals of these estimates are considerably narrower than those in the source studies. Conclusions Our results indicate that vulnerability to both cannabis use initiation and problematic use was influenced significantly by A, C and E. There was a trend for a greater C and lesser A component for cannabis use initiation compared to problematic use for females. © 2010 Society for the Study of Addiction...|$|R

First, it provides causal evidence on the effects of home care policy generosity on hospitalizations, doctor visits, and nursing home use. Variations in generosity across the Swiss cantons and over time are used to identify the effects of canton home care policy. The endogeneity of that policy is addressed by using instrumental variables. Second, comprehensive measures of regional home care policy are developed. Two dimensions of generosity are measured as latent variables using factor analysis: the Participation and Intensity dimensions (i. e. how many persons have access to home care services and how much care is provided to home care users). Third, it proposes a bias correction to the OLS estimator for linear regression with factor scores (i. <b>e.</b> <b>estimated</b> values of latent variables such as home care policy) ...|$|E
