40|$|Abstract The correct {{implementation}} of Ambulatory Surgery {{must be accompanied}} by an accurate monitoring of the patient post-discharge state. We fit different statistical models to predict the first hours postoperative status of a <b>discharged</b> <b>patient.</b> We will also be able to predict, for any <b>discharged</b> <b>patient,</b> the probability of needing a closer follow-up, or of having a normal progress at home. Background The status of a <b>discharged</b> <b>patient</b> is predicted during the first 48 hours after discharge by using variables routinely used in Ambulatory Surgery. The models fitted will provide the physician with an insight into the post-discharge progress. These models will provide valuable information to assist in educating the patient and their carers about what to expect after discharge as well as to improve their overall level of satisfaction. Methods A total of 922 patients from the Ambulatory Surgery Unit of the Dr. Peset University Hospital (Valencia, Spain) were selected for this study. Their post-discharge status was evaluated through a phone questionnaire. We pretend to predict four variables which were self-reported via phone interviews with the discharged patient: sleep, pain, oral tolerance of fluid/food and bleeding status. A fifth variable called phone score will be built as the sum of these four ordinal variables. The number of phone interviews varies between patients, depending on the evolution. The proportional odds model was used. The predictors were age, sex, ASA status, surgical time, discharge time, type of anaesthesia, surgical specialty and ambulatory surgical incapacity (ASI). This last variable reflects, before the operation, the state of incapacity and severity of symptoms in the <b>discharged</b> <b>patient.</b> Results Age, ambulatory surgical incapacity and the surgical specialty are significant to explain the level of pain at the first call. For the first two phone calls, ambulatory surgical incapacity is significant as a predictor for all responses except for sleep at the first call. Conclusions The variable ambulatory surgical incapacity proved to be a good predictor of the patient's status at home. These predictions could be used to assist in educating patients and their carers about what to expect after discharge, as well as to improve their overall level of satisfaction. </p...|$|E

40|$|Hospital readmissions {{present a}} costly problem for {{healthcare}} systems. Engaging care providers in reviewing readmissions may reveal opportunities for reducing readmissions and improving quality. We developed a real-time alerting method that e-mails providers when a <b>discharged</b> <b>patient</b> returns for care (emergency department [ED] or hospital admission) within 30 days. We analyzed {{the content of}} alerts to consider frequency of presentation and demographic characteristics of readmitted patients. From 3 / 15 / 2011 to 8 / 31 / 2011, 1544 alerts (943 ED returns; 601 inpatient readmissions) were generated, representing 621 unique patients (average return time: 12. 8 ± 8. 5 days). Forty-eight faculty received alerts; 88. 8 % of alerts {{were sent to the}} correct discharging provider.

40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} extent to which medical {{coverage}} is available to <b>discharged</b> leprosy <b>patients</b> in communities. Evidence has shown that after care services, follow-up visits and national disease prevention programs are important components of medical rehabilitation to leprosy <b>patients</b> <b>discharged</b> home after treatment. Denying them accessibility to these services could expose them to multiple disabilities as well as several disease conditions including HIV/AIDS. These adverse health conditions could be averted if health workers extend healthcare services to <b>discharged</b> leprosy <b>patients.</b> This study was conducted to examine {{the extent to}} which <b>discharged</b> leprosy <b>patients</b> have access to healthcare services in the communities. Methods: All 33 leprosy patients who were fully treated with multidrug therapy (MDT) and discharged home in the two leprosy settlements in Abia and Ebonyi States of Nigeria were included in this study. The list of <b>discharged</b> leprosy <b>patients</b> studied and their addresses were provided by the leprosy settlements where they were treated. Also, snowball-sampling method was used to identify some of the leprosy patients whose addresses were difficult to locate in the communities. Instruments for data collection were questionnaire, interview guide and checklist. These were administered because respondents were essentially those with no formal education. Analysis of data was done quantitatively and qualitatively. Results: Findings showed that 20 (60. 6 � 20 of <b>discharged</b> <b>patients</b> did not receive health programs like HIV/AIDS prevention or family planning. Also, follow-up visits and after-care services were poor. About 14 (42. 4 � 20 of the patients live in dirty and overcrowded houses. On the whole, <b>discharged</b> <b>patients</b> were poorly medically rehabilitated (mean score: 4. 7 ± 1. 1 out of total score of 7). Conclusion: Denying <b>discharged</b> leprosy <b>patients</b> opportunity of accessing health care services could increase prevalence of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS among them.

40|$|Background: After {{hospital}} discharge, community pharmacists {{are often}} the first health care professionals the <b>discharged</b> <b>patient</b> encounters.

Methods: A focus group was conducted {{with a sample of}} six community pharmacists from different Swiss regions. Based on these qualitative results, a nationwide online-questionnaire was sent to 1348 Swiss pharmacies. Results: The focus group participants were concerned about their extensive workload with discharge prescriptions and about gaps in therapy.

40|$|Aims: Patients with {{diabetes}} have higher readmission rates than those without diabetes, yet limited data on {{efforts to reduce}} their readmissions are available. We describe a novel model of inpatient diabetes care, expanding the role of diabetes educators to include case management, and establishment of a Diabetes Resource Nurse program, aimed at increasing the knowledge of staff nurses, and evaluate {{the impact of this}} program on readmission rates. Methods: We performed retrospective analysis of 30 -day readmission rates of patients {{with diabetes}} before (July 2010 –December 2011), and after (January 2012 –June 2013) starting the implementation of this tiered inpatient diabetes care delivery model. Results: We analyzed 34, 472 <b>discharged</b> <b>patient</b> records from the 18 -month pre-intervention period, and 32, 046 records from the 18 -month post-intervention period.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} motivators and barriers that paediatricians face when <b>discharging</b> <b>patients</b> from outpatient specialty care. A questionnaire was administered to outpatient care paediatricians in Victoria working in one of five speciality public hospital clinics. Questions focused on how important various motivators and barriers were in respondents' decision to <b>discharge</b> a <b>patient</b> from their clinic. Nearly all (91 %, n= 74) paediatricians invited to participate provided responses. The factor influencing the greatest proportion of paediatricians in their decision to <b>discharge</b> <b>patients</b> back to primary care was the potential that patients may not receive the required care from a GP. The next most highly rated barrier was that it is too complicated to arrange discharge; rated as a very important influence by one-third of paediatricians (33 %, n= 24). Improvements to the discharge process may encourage more paediatricians to <b>discharge</b> <b>patients</b> back to their GP, therefore freeing up appointment slots.

40|$|This pilot {{randomized}} control {{trial was}} motivated by the discovery that many individuals with mental health problems are re-hospitalized within a year, with many being unable to fully adjust to community living. A solution was proposed {{in the form of}} an intervention called transitional discharge. The transitional discharge model included: (1) peer support, which is assistance from former patients who provide friendship, understanding and encouragement; and (2) overlap of inpatient and community staff in which the inpatient staff continue to work with the <b>discharged</b> <b>patient</b> until a working relationship is established with a community care provider. The overall aim of this study was to test the discharge model designed to assist patients discharged from acute admission wards to adjust to community living. This aim was tested through a number of related hypotheses, which suggest that, 5 months following discharge from an acute admission ward of a psychiatric hospital, individuals participating in a transitional discharge model: (1) report fewer symptoms; (2) report better levels of functioning; (3) have better quality of life; (4) are less likely to have been re-admitted to hospital. The study used a randomized experimental design with two conditions: experimental and usual treatment. In general, both the control and the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in symptom severity and functional ability after 5 months. Usual treatment subjects in the control group were more than twice as likely to be re-admitted to hospital.

40|$|Within Canadian society inequities {{exist in}} health status {{and health care}} provision. Residents of rural, {{isolated}} areas tend to fare worse when compared with their urban counterparts. Much of the research about health care provision is written for and from urban centres. However, the research in this thesis is not urban-based and addresses an issue important to rural communities. The research explores how discharge planning is accomplished at rural and small town acute care hospitals within the Northern Interior Health Region of British Columbia. A descriptive qualitative methodology was used to address the research question. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted at five different small town locations within the Northern Interior Health Region of British Columbia. At each location {{interviews were conducted with}} three key informants about the discharge planning practices utilized at the local hospital. These key informants were a practicing physician, a nurse employed at the hospital, and a recently <b>discharged</b> <b>patient.</b> Analysis of the interview transcripts revealed twenty-four themes. Eleven of these themes suggest that the rural and small town environment exerts a positive influence on discharge planning processes, practices, and outcomes. Thirteen of the emergent themes suggest that the rural and small town context negatively influences discharge planning. A comparative analysis across key informant groups found similarities across the groups with physician and nurse responses being most similar. The themes derived from the patient interviews were more unique. Results suggest that improving outcomes for patients discharged from rural and small town hospitals will require augmentation and coordination of community based supports such as home care nursing, mental health services, and social services. Increased accessibility to specialist resources and more direct involvement of patients in planning for their post-hospital care needs are also indicated.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: There are few data {{available}} about factors which influence physicians' decisions to <b>discharge</b> <b>patients</b> from their practices. To study general internists' and family medicine physicians' attitudes and experiences in <b>discharging</b> <b>patients</b> from their practices. DESIGN: A cross-sectional mailed survey was used. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand general internists and family medicine physicians {{participated in this}} study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We studied the likelihood physicians would <b>discharge</b> 12 hypothetical <b>patients</b> from their practices, and whether they had actually <b>discharged</b> such <b>patients.</b> The effect of demographic data {{on the number of}} scenarios in which patients were likely to be discharged, and the number of <b>patients</b> actually <b>discharged</b> were analyzed via ANOVA and multiple logistic regression analysis. Of 977 surveys received by subjects, 526 (54 %) were completed and returned. A majority of respondents were willing to <b>discharge</b> <b>patients</b> in 5 of 12 hypothetical scenarios. Eighty-five percent had actually discharged at least one patient from their practices. Most respondents (71 %) had discharged 10 or fewer patients, but 14 % had discharged 11 to 200 patients. Respondents who were in private practice (p= 48 years old) were more likely to <b>discharge</b> actual <b>patients</b> from their practices (p= 0. 005) as were physicians practicing in rural settings (p= 0. 003).

40|$|Objectives With {{the growing}} number of outpatients on {{ventricular}} assist devices (VADs), there is an increasing need for "home discharge programs. " One important feature is a 24 -hour telephone service. In our center, the perfusionists run a so-called "hotline" for all of our VAD patients. This study analyzes the hotline calls with regard to frequency, the reason for calling, and the type of action undertaken. Patients and Methods Over a period of 5 years, 16 (12 EXCOR and 4 INCOR; Berlin Heart, Berlin, Germany) of 33 VAD patients (48 %) were discharged and instructed to use the "hotline" service. All the calls received by the perfusionists were reviewed. We classified the calls into three levels according to the severity of the problem: Level (L) 1 = assistance provided by the perfusionist alone; L 2 = calls requiring discussion with the surgeon on duty and/or visit to the outpatient clinic ahead of time; and L 3 = immediate action and/or admission to the hospital. Results Over a period of 2, 890 outpatient days (7. 9 years), a total of 26 calls were registered. There were 0. 9 calls per 100 patient days and 1. 6 calls per <b>discharged</b> <b>patient.</b> Out of the 26 calls, 14 calls (54 %) were classified as L 1, 8 (31 %) as L 2, and 4 (15 %) as L 3. The most frequent reasons for L 1 or L 2 calls were fibrin deposits in the EXCOR pump chamber (39 %), followed by battery dysfunction (19 %). L 3 calls were related to dysfunction of the EXCOR driving units in three cases and to an EXCOR pump chamber disconnection, which the patient did not survive. Conclusions The institution of a hotline is an essential component of a VAD outpatient program. It provides a certain level of safety for the patient, although a residual risk remains...|$|E

Risk management experiences in this respect in a large-scale Joint Commission International (JCI) -accredited academic medical center hospital in the People’s Republic of China during 2011 – 2015, focusing on organizational, educational, motivational, and information technological measures in storage, prescribing, preparing, dispensing, administration, and monitoring of medication are summarized. The intensity of use of meperidine in hospitalized patients in 2015 was one-fourth that in 2011. A 100 % implementation rate of standard storage of narcotics has been achieved in the hospital since December 2012. A “Plan, Do, Check, Act” cycle was efficient because the ratio of number of inappropriate narcotics prescriptions to total number of narcotics prescriptions for inpatients decreased from August 2014 to December 2014 (28. 22 % versus 2. 96 %, P= 0. 0000), and it was controlled below 6 % from then on. During the journey to good pain management ward accreditation by the Ministry of Health, People’s Republic of China, (April 2012 –October 2012), the medical oncology ward successfully demonstrated {{an increase in the}} pain screening rate at admission from 43. 5 % to 100 %, cancer pain control rate from 85 % to 96 %, and degree of satisfaction toward pain nursing from 95. 4 % to 100 % (all P-values < 0. 05). Oral morphine equivalent dosage in the good pain management ward increased from 2. 3 mg/patient before June 2012 to 54. 74 mg/patient in 2014. From 2011 to 2015, the oral morphine equivalent dose per <b>discharged</b> <b>patient</b> increased from 8. 52 mg/person to 20. 36 mg/person. A 100 % implementation rate of independent double-check prior to narcotics dosing has been achieved since January 2013. From 2014 to 2015, the ratio of number of narcotics-related medication errors to number of discharged patients significantly decreased (6. 95 % versus 0. 99 %, P= 0. 0000).

These abnormal relationships are not inconsequential in terms of numbers and/or their effects (short-term and long term) on both patients and physicians. Every country has its own baggage in the wake of why, how and what about these abnormal ends to physician-patient relationships; however, the most common causes are the patients’ inability to pay their medical bills, the conflicting goals of physicians and their patients in regards to patients’ sufferings’ management and finally the behavioral issues (patients’ and/or physicians’) interfering these relationships. Irrespective of any cause, the physicians should never forget that the patient can always discharge their physicians and discontinue their relationship with their physicians without any reason (until unless the physicians deem those patients either incapable/non-consentable to do so and/or potential threat to their own personal safety or other people’s safety). Contrarily, physicians can also discharge patients from their care but cannot abandon these patients (1 - 3) which mean that physicians have to ensure their discharged patients either are referred to or have sought another physician within appropriate time frame post-relationship-discontinuation. Each country has their own medico-legal liabilities that vary in terms of penalties imposed; however, irrespective of the feared legal concerns, the physicians should not forget that ethical essence of medicine is the art of healing that does not encompass part of deserting patients but rather appropriate transferring of patient care to accepting/receptive fellow brethren/colleagues. The transfer of care does not mean that a particular physician has failed to perform his/her duties for his/her patients rather that the particular relationship with a particular patient has failed to meet its ends. Therefore without abandoning the patient, the patient is given ample and honest opportunity to be transferred out to another physician with the sincere hope that the <b>discharged</b> <b>patient</b> will be able to achieve relief of his/her suffering with the new physician-patient relationship meeting their goals and means-to-the-ends. The one thing that need not be forgotten is that the terminated physician-patient relationship can always be revived if the causative concerns have been resolved in the interim and if the medico-legal laws and ethical practices allow the relationships’ revival. In summary, it is prerogative of the patient (whose suffering made him/her to reach out to a physician and enter in a physician-patient relationship in the first place) when he/she wants to and decides to terminate physician-patient relationship; whereas the prerogative of the physician is to recognize a dysfunctional physician-patient relationship early-on so that corrective measures (if possible) can be executed, and if that is not possible, then instead of patient abandonment, patients may be appropriately and timely transferred out off failed physician-patient relationship...|$|E
