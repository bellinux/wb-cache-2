40|$|Reported {{evidence}} suggests that failure of <b>gusset</b> plates initiated {{the collapse of the}} I- 35 W Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The particular <b>gusset</b> plates were at a panel point designated as U 10. Therefore, a computational study was conducted on the condition of the U 10 <b>gusset</b> plates at the time of bridge collapse. The primary objectives of this study were: (1) to evaluate previous research and existing design methods for <b>gusset</b> plate connections; (2) to examine the mechanical condition of the U 10 <b>gusset</b> plates {{at the time of the}} collapse; (3) to examine possible scenarios that led to the collapse of the entire bridge; and (4) to identify research needs to improve the design methods for <b>gusset</b> plate connections. The forces delivered to panel point U 10 were reproduced using available information of the bridge. The truss forces were introduced to detailed nonlinear, three-dimensional finite element models to calculate stress and strain states of the <b>gusset</b> plates. The results indicate that substantial portions of the U 10 <b>gusset</b> plates were yielded at the time of collapse, confirming earlier findings from federal and state investigations. Insufficient strength of the <b>gusset</b> plate, along with weight increase due to past deck reconstruction and construction material and equipment staged on the day of collapse, were identified as the main contributing factors to the substantial yielding. It is important to note that, even with the weight increase, the <b>gusset</b> plates would not have yielded substantially if the <b>gusset</b> plates had adequate thickness. The results also suggest that the interaction of compression and shear played an important role in the <b>gusset</b> plate failure and should be addressed in <b>gusset</b> plate design.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 <b>Gusset</b> plate {{connections}} {{are commonly used}} to join members in steel truss bridges. Most <b>gusset</b> plate connections were designed to provide sufficient thickness to resist tensile and shear forces as well as compression buckling based on simple approximations. The 2007 collapse of the I- 35 W Bridge in Minnesota necessitated the safety assessment of <b>gusset</b> plates and prompted several studies of <b>gusset</b> plate behavior. The complex geometry and various loading profiles {{make it difficult to}} analyze and estimate maximum stress in <b>gusset</b> plates and its capacity. This research focuses on numerical simulation of steel truss bridge <b>gusset</b> plate connections. A simple but accurate finite element modeling methodology was developed to efficiently simulate <b>gusset</b> plate connection subassemblages. A rapid procedure for assessing <b>gusset</b> plate safety, namely Triage Evaluation Procedure (TEP), was developed to predict the onset of <b>gusset</b> plate yielding. This procedure considers the worst-case scenario for the interaction of stresses generated by connected truss members and conservatively identifies at risk <b>gusset</b> plates. A Refined Evaluation Procedure (REP) was then developed to predict stress distributions at critical sections using simple and idealized approximate stress distribution models. By using these stress distribution models at the critical sections, the location and magnitude of the maximum stress in the <b>gusset</b> plate connections can be estimated. The TEP and REP are two-step evaluation procedures to provide fast and accurate estimate for <b>gusset</b> plate yield capacity. In addition to the <b>gusset</b> plates, rivet shear resistance needs to be considered to evaluate the overall safety of <b>gusset</b> plate connections. Rivet shear strength, rivet ductility, connected member yielding, and the effect of connection length were identified as factors which affect joint strength. The current AASHTO bridge evaluation code does not consider all four factors and yields an overly-conservative estimate of joint shear resistance. A revised equation which considers ``Strong'' and ``Weak" connected elements and produces a more reasonable estimate of joint shear resistance is recommended...|$|R

25|$|Like weaving, {{knitting}} is {{a technique}} for producing a two-dimensional fabric made from a one-dimensional yarn or thread. In weaving, threads are always straight, running parallel either lengthwise (warp threads) or crosswise (weft threads). By contrast, the yarn in knitted fabrics follows a meandering path (a course), forming symmetric loops (also called bights) symmetrically {{above and below the}} mean path of the yarn. These meandering loops can be easily stretched in different directions giving knit fabrics much more elasticity than woven fabrics. Depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, knitted garments can stretch as much as 500%. For this reason, knitting was initially developed for garments that must be elastic or stretch in response to the wearer's motions, such as socks and hosiery. For comparison, woven garments stretch mainly along one or other of a related pair of directions that lie roughly diagonally between the warp and the weft, while contracting in the other direction of the pair (stretching and contracting with the bias), and are not very elastic, unless they are woven from stretchable material such as spandex. Knitted garments are often more form-fitting than woven garments, since their elasticity allows them to contour to the body's outline more closely; by contrast, curvature is introduced into most woven garments only with sewn darts, flares, <b>gussets</b> and gores, the seams of which lower the elasticity of the woven fabric still further. Extra curvature can be introduced into knitted garments without seams, as in the heel of a sock; the effect of darts, flares, etc. can be obtained with short rows or by increasing or decreasing the number of stitches. Thread used in weaving is usually much finer than the yarn used in knitting, which can give the knitted fabric more bulk and less drape than a woven fabric.|$|E

As stated in Procter & Gamble's initial 1973 patent for the use of double <b>gussets</b> in a diaper, “The double gusset folded areas tend to readily conform to the thigh portions of the leg of the infant. This allows quick and easy fitting and provides a snug and comfortable diaper fit that will neither bind nor wad on the infant…as a result of this snugger fit obtained because of this fold configuration, the diaper is less likely to leak or, in other words, its containment characteristics are greatly enhanced.” Further developments in diaper design were made, such as the introduction of refastenable tapes, the [...] "hourglass shape" [...] so as to reduce bulk at the crotch area, and the 1984 introduction of super-absorbent material from polymers known as sodium polyacrylate that were originally developed in 1966.|$|E

40|$|Fillet welded Lap Splice Joints are {{commonly}} used to connect tension members to a <b>gusset</b> plate. In most cases, the shear yielding strength, or Base Metal Shear Yielding (BMSY) strength, of the <b>gusset</b> plates controls {{the capacity of the}} connection. The stress from tension members is transferred to the <b>gusset</b> plate through fillet welds, causing the yielding of the <b>gusset</b> plate. In current engineering practice, designers use the “Shear of Elements in Shear” equation from the AISC- 10 to estimate the BMSY strength of <b>gusset</b> plates. The gross area subjected to shear is assumed to be the product of weld length and thickness of the <b>gusset</b> plate. However, the approach does not account for the material adjacent to the weld. Shear stress can travel away from the welds, increasing the gross area and total BMSY strength of the <b>gusset</b> plate. ^ Six lap welded specimens were tested in this research to serve two purposes. One specimen was used to study the stress profiles on the <b>gusset</b> plate and tension members. The remaining specimens were tested to determine the actual shear yielding strength of the <b>gusset</b> plates. A new analytical mode was created from test results to predict shear yielding strength more accurately. In addition, fifteen finite element models were analyzed to study the effects of the geometric parameter such as weld length, edge distance, and weld separation.

[...] An investigation revealed several deficiencies {{in the construction of}} the M3's bolt retraction mechanism, together with issues concerning barrel removal and retention as well as easily bent rear sights.

40|$|The {{traditional}} design {{method of}} <b>gusset</b> plates neglects the frame deformation 2 ̆ 7 s effect, {{which could lead}} to under designing the <b>gusset</b> plate. The traditional design method only considers the stress caused by the bracing member in tension, which creates tension and shear stresses in the <b>gusset</b> plate, however, the deformation of the column and beam connected to the <b>gusset</b> plate introduce compressive stresses, potentially increasing the stress in the <b>gusset</b> plate. The following factors are studied using finite element method: (a) the relative stiffness between the beam, the column and the bracing element, and (b) the configuration of the <b>gusset</b> plate. Two <b>gusset</b> plate configurations and two beam and column cross sections were used to compare the results. To determine the increase caused by the frame deformation two approaches were used; approach I ignores frame deformation while approach II takes into consideration the effects of frame deformation. This study concludes that factor b, the configuration of the <b>gusset</b> plate, has the greatest impact on the increase of stress {{at the end of the}} weld. Additionally, factor a, the relative stiffness between the beam to bracing element and column to bracing element, has a slightly less significant impact on the <b>gusset</b> plate stress than the configuration of the <b>gusset</b> plate.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 The {{collapse}} of the I- 35 W Bridge in Minneapolis, MN in 2007 prompted {{an investigation into the}} design and inspection of the steel truss bridges. Further investigation into the collapse revealed that a <b>gusset</b> plate experienced sway buckling, causing the bridge failure. This bridge failure motivated research into the analysis and design of <b>gusset</b> plates. Another major motivation for the current research is the effect of the connecting member's stiffness on the capacity of the <b>gusset</b> plate, which is not considered in the current design methods. The research presented in this thesis discusses a nonlinear finite-element analysis approach using OpenSees for load rating <b>gusset</b> plates in steel structures. Using OpenSees to analyze and design <b>gusset</b> plates is a new approach and therefore validation of the model was required. Simple tension, bending, shear, h-refinement, element type, patch, and elastic range tests were conducted to validate the model. The major parameters studied in this research include: element size, material properties, connecting member stiffness, plate geometry, out-of-plane shape, and magnitude of out-of-plane imperfection at the loaded members in the <b>gusset</b> plate. The displacement at the centroid of the loaded members was monitored as well as out-of-plane displacement and stress contours in the <b>gusset</b> plate. The results showed a strong correlation to other finite-element analysis program predictions and experimental results from sway buckling experiments. This research affirmed recent findings that the connecting member stiffness has a significant effect on the load capacity of a <b>gusset</b> plate connection. The results and comparisons also show that the new method using OpenSees is conservative in predicting sway buckling in <b>gusset</b> plates with connecting members. The predicted failure load for both single and double <b>gusset</b> plate connections was found to be conservative as well. The current research has shown great promise in its ability to accurately and conservatively predict failure of <b>gusset</b> plates, which will assist in the design of <b>gusset</b> plates in the future...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The {{collapse}} of the I- 35 W Bridge in Minneapolis, MN on August 1, 2007 brought into question the design and inspection of <b>gusset</b> plates in steel truss bridges. The experimental tests performed in this research study the sway-buckling strength and behavior of large-scale steel <b>gusset</b> plates in an isolated truss connection. Parameters studied include plate thickness,combination member loading, initial out-of-plane imperfection, diagonal compression member out-of-plane flexural stiffness, corrosion, and alternative retrofits to increase lateral stiffness. The flexural stiffness of the diagonal compression member and retrofit designs were unique to the testing program. The variables monitored during testing include <b>gusset</b> plate surface stresses and strains, member axial strains, out-of-plane displacement of the <b>gusset</b> plate free edge, and buckling capacity. The results were compared with previously established design models for predicting buckling capacity of <b>gusset</b> plates which include the Whitmore effective width, the Modified-Thornton method, and the FHWA Load Rating Guidelines. A parametric finite element model was developed to determine the lateral stiffness of the <b>gusset</b> plate connection and the additional stiffness provided by the alternative retrofit options. The results showed interaction between the diagonal compression member and <b>gusset</b> plate occurs, which affects sway-buckling capacity. Combination of member loads showed evidence of detrimental effects on sway-buckling capacity. Corrosion of the <b>gusset</b> plates along {{the top edge of}} the bottom chord did not lead to significant reduction in sway-buckling capacity. The two retrofit designs showed increases in both lateral stiffness and buckling capacity as well as economic benefits over traditional retrofit methods. Comparison of the results to the current design guidelines showed that the current methods are conservative and do not accurately represent the true behavior of <b>gusset</b> plate connections. The research concludes with two proposed models for future use in design and retrofit of <b>gusset</b> plates. The first is a member-gusset plate interaction model based on a stepped column analogy that takes into account the effects of member flexural stiffness and <b>gusset</b> plate stiffness. The second is a general design guideline developed for retrofit of <b>gusset</b> plate connections dominated by sway-buckling behavior which uses a stiffness based approach to increase the capacity of <b>gusset</b> plate connections...|$|R
