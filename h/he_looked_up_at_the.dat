500|$|According to Chen, Cloud was {{designed}} to [...] "expand the spectrum of emotions video games evoke." [...] Chen had the first idea for the game; while walking to school one day <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky, noticing {{the difference between the}} fluffy clouds there and the [...] "polluted and gray" [...] clouds of Shanghai where he was born, and thought about making a game about clouds. It was given a story to [...] "create the premise and help player to be emotionally invested"; however, the team avoided making the story too strong, as it would [...] "distract the player from the core experience" [...] of flying freely and shaping clouds. In the early stages of development, the game had an involved backstory about an alien who attempts to clean up the environment, but this was cut down to [...] "a simple 'poetic' introduction to the cloud child trapped in a hospital bed." [...] The team intended Cloud to [...] "communicate a feeling of youthfulness, freedom, and the wonder of imagination." [...] It was built on a modified version of a game engine developed by several team members for their previous game, Dyadin. At the 2006 Game Developers Conference student showcase, Chen and Santiago pitched Cloud to Sony representative John Hight as the first game in the [...] "Zen" [...] genre. Hight was interested, but Sony declined to publish the game.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> house, and saw Carmina at {{the open}} window of her bedroom.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her, the slow, derisive smile curling his lips.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her sharply. She nodded slowly, like a {{porcelain}} mandarin.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me again, {{and swore}} {{one of his}} great oaths.|$|R
60|$|When Martin {{got on the}} {{electric}} car, he was very sick and tired. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> assertive sign.|$|E
60|$|De Brensault twirled his moustache. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Princess {{as though}} trying to fathom {{the meaning of}} her words.|$|E
60|$|A change {{passed over}} his {{handsome}} face: he frowned, and his color deepened as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> light in his father's window.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{his friend}} and {{secretary}} in an amazement that overcame his shame.|$|R
60|$|And then {{a thought}} raced along Stephen's mind and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> his friend.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{her sitting}} her great black horse beside {{which he had}} been pacing.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{ought to}} see {{that if they are}} not all asleep," [...] Frank said, as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sails {{standing}} out white against the dark sky.|$|E
6000|$|... "Samoval, is it?" [...] said Sir Terence, {{and went}} {{down on one knee}} beside the body to make a {{perfunctory}} examination. Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> captain.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky, {{and the others}} did the same. Off to the westward they saw a number of black clouds rolling up rapidly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her, and {{the ghost}} of an unholy smile flickered upon his lips.|$|R
60|$|He scanned {{his finger}} nails. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Redwood with eyes bland through his glasses.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Fentolin stopped painting. His {{face was}} full of concern as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Hamel.|$|R
60|$|He heaved {{himself out}} of the chair, and left the room. Ann, coming down from the gallery, found Jimmy meditating. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sound of her step.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] And <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{magnificent}} snow peak. [...] "Only good to cool wine with, eh? and as {{safe for}} the time being as Solomon's birds." ...|$|E
60|$|Slowly Jimmy {{drew the}} letters from his inside pocket and read {{them one by}} one, {{spreading}} them out upon the table before him. Presently <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her. A {{small smile}} of misery twisted his face. He shrugged his shoulders.|$|R
60|$|The Duke looked thoughtfully {{for several}} moments at the table before him. Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me.|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's silence. Lord Cheisford {{turned again}} to his notes. Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me.|$|R
60|$|Neale {{threw his}} note-book upon the dusty table and, sitting {{down on the}} box, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> men. Both {{engineers}} were studying him intently, almost eagerly, Neale imagined.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Prince with burning eyes. [...] "I thank you, sir, for deigning to {{consider}} so poor a knight as myself," [...] said he in a feeble voice.|$|E
6000|$|... 'None of it,' {{answered}} Paul. Feeling {{that the}} answer {{was a shock to}} Miss Blimber's sensibility, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> three faces that were looking down at him, and said: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{her with}} a sudden {{accession}} of confidence; her interest in the hat had flattered him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her calmly. His {{face was}} round and chubby {{and his eyes}} were big, blue, and earnest.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her then, sidelong. The {{curve of}} her cheek and chin looked very soft, and rather jolly.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it, Uncle Dan'l? is Abner any sicker?" [...] he asked, with quivering lip, as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{wrinkled}} {{face that}} ever wore a kindly look for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will!" [...] {{answered}} Tom, and {{ran down}} the stairs three steps at a time. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front of the house but saw nothing unusual. Then he dashed to the rear.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{a dreadful}} situation,' said Mr. Pickwick, pausing {{to wipe his}} brow after this exercise. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> house--all was dark. They must be gone to bed now. He would try the signal again.|$|E
60|$|He rallied at {{the sound}} of that beloved voice. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her as she knelt at his head.|$|R
60|$|When he had bowed quite {{formally}} to Crystal <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Bobby {{and gave}} him a pleasant and friendly nod.|$|R
60|$|The {{operator}} {{smiled and}} bowed, {{and when he}} read the message <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her keenly, but did not smile.|$|R
