In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity, and by the mid-20th century, the <b>Gaia</b> <b>Principle</b> compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability. Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities.|$|E

These observations are linked to cybernetics with the <b>Gaia</b> <b>principle,</b> based on the conclusions of James Lovelock, shared by Jean Malaurie: the Earth would be [...] "a dynamic physiological system that includes the biosphere and has kept our planet fit for life for over three billion years".|$|E

Topics of interest include how the biosphere and the evolution of life forms affect the stability of global temperature, ocean salinity, oxygen in the atmosphere, the maintenance of a hydrosphere of liquid water and other environmental variables that affect the habitability of Earth.|$|E
