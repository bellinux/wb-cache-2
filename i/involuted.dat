60|$|The way {{he spoke}} those words {{affected}} Fleur, {{but she thought}} of Jon, and was silent, tapping her foot against the wainscot.

60|$|Now, I {{was going}} to make a speech--I {{supposed}} I was, but I am not.

60|$|It was a {{kid that}} he had come to roast. But it {{was a kid}} opened out, made quite flat, and speared like a flat fan on a long iron stalk. It was a really curious sight. And it must have taken some doing. The whole of the skinned kid was there, the head curled in against a shoulder, the stubby cut ears, the eyes, the teeth, the few hairs of the nostrils: and the feet curled curiously round, like an animal that puts its fore-paw over its ducked head: and the hind-legs twisted indescribably up: and all {{skewered}} flat-wise upon the long iron rod, so that it was a complete flat pattern. It reminded me intensely of those distorted, slim-limbed, dog-like animals which figure on the old Lombard ornaments, distorted and curiously infolded upon themselves. Celtic illuminations also have these distorted, <b>involuted</b> creatures.|$|E
60|$|Then inside, what {{dear old}} quaintnesses! which I {{began to look}} at with delight, even when I was so crude a members of the congregation, that my nurse found it {{necessary}} to provide for the reinforcement of my devotional patience by smuggling bread-and-butter into the sacred edifice. There was the chancel, guarded by two little cherubims looking uncomfortably squeezed between arch and wall, and adorned with the escutcheons of the Oldinport family, which showed me inexhaustible possibilities of meaning in their blood-red hands, their death's-heads and cross-bones, their leopards' paws, and Maltese crosses. There were inscriptions on the panels of the singing-gallery, telling of benefactions to the poor of Shepperton, with an <b>involuted</b> elegance of capitals and final flourishes, which my alphabetic erudition traced with ever-new delight. No benches in those days; but huge roomy pews, round which devout church-goers sat during 'lessons', trying to look anywhere else than into each other's eyes. No low partitions allowing you, with a dreary absence of contrast and mystery, to see everything at all moments; but tall dark panels, under whose shadow I sank with a sense of retirement through the Litany, only to feel with more intensity my burst into the conspicuousness of public life when I was made to stand up on the seat during the psalms or the singing. And the singing was no mechanical affair of official routine; it had a drama. As the moment of psalmody approached, by some process to me as mysterious and untraceable as the opening of the flowers or the breaking-out of the stars, a slate appeared in front of the gallery, advertising in bold characters the psalm about to be sung, lest the sonorous announcement of the clerk should still leave the bucolic mind in doubt on that head. Then followed the migration of the clerk to the gallery, where, in company with a bassoon, two key-bugles, a carpenter understood to have an amazing power of singing 'counter', and two lesser musical stars, he formed the complement of a choir regarded in Shepperton as one of distinguished attraction, occasionally known to draw hearers from the next parish. The innovation of hymn-books was as yet undreamed of; even the New Version was regarded with a sort of melancholy tolerance, as part of the common degeneracy in a time when prices had dwindled, and a cotton gown was no longer stout enough to last a lifetime; for the lyrical taste of the best heads in Shepperton had been formed on Sternhold and Hopkins. But the greatest triumphs of the Shepperton choir were reserved for the Sundays when the slate announced an ANTHEM, with a dignified abstinence from particularization, both words and music lying far {{beyond the reach of the}} most ambitious amateur in the congregation: an anthem in which the key-bugles always ran away at a great pace, while the bassoon every now and then boomed a flying shot after them.|$|E

50|$|The trigeminal artery {{arises from}} the {{primitive}} internal carotid artery during development, when the embryo is approximately 6 weeks old. The trigeminal artery then anastomoses with the basilar artery. At this point in development, the trigeminal artery serves as the main blood supply for the hindbrain, as other vessels {{in the region have}} yet to mature. As the internal carotid artery branches more caudally to form the posterior communicating artery, the trigeminal artery becomes less important in supplying blood and ultimately involutes.

5000|$|The ciliates {{are long}} and ribbon-shaped, like other karyorelictean ciliates {{that live in the}} meiofaunal habitat.

You had to watch out what you were doing. If you had Humphrey Bogart at the same age that he was when he did The Big Sleep, he wouldn't do it the same way.

50|$|Surgical {{resection}} for congenital hemangiomas {{is rarely}} needed, because RICH undergoes postnatal regression and NICH is benign and often asymptomatic. Resection may be indicated {{to improve the}} appearance of the affected area, as long as the surgical scar is less noticeable than the lesion. Other indications are problematic ulcers with persistent bleeding or chronic infection.Although most NICH lesions are non-problematic and do not cause significant deformity, the threshold for resection of NICH is lower, because it neither involutes, nor responds to pharmacotherapy. RICH tumors are observed until involution is completed. <b>Involuted</b> RICH may leave behind atrophic tissue, which can be reconstructed with autologous grafts. It is often best to postpone excision until regression is complete.There are effective pharmacologic treatments, which include intralesional corticosteroid injection, systemic corticosteroid injection, interferon α-2a or α-2b and angiogenic inhibitors. The use of corticosteroids leads to accelerated regression in 30%, stabilization of growth in 40%, lightening of color and softening of the tumor. However, 30% shows minimal or no response. Another drug treatment is interferon α-2a or α-2b. It is often used for patients who did not respond to corticosteroids. Although the response rate is much slower, it has been successful for 80% of children treated. The most serious side effect of interferon is a spastic diplegia. Other therapeutic options are embolization and pulsed-dye laser, which improves residual telangiectasias in RICH and in NICH.|$|E
5000|$|Frog (Xenopus), as well {{as other}} amphibian, {{gastrulation}} serves as an excellent example of the role of convergent extension in embryogenesis. During gastrulation in frogs, the driving force of convergent extension is the morphogenic activity of the presumptive dorsal mesodermal cells; this activity is driven by the mesenchymal cells that lie beneath the presumptive mesodermal and neural tissues. [...] These tissues exist within the involuting marginal zone (IMZ) of the embryo which lies between the vegetal endoderm and the posterior neural tissue. The IMZ is integral to gastrulation and R. Keller et al. eloquently exemplify the importance of convergent extension in Xenopus gastrulation. “…the IMZ, true to its name, involutes or rolls over the blastoporal lip and turns inside out. As it involutes, it converges along the mediolateral axis and extends along the future anterior-posterior axis of the notochordal and somitic mesoderm. Convergence and extension of these tissues squeezes the blastopore shut and simultaneously elongate the body axis. Elongation continues through the neurula and tailbud stages…As these <b>involuted</b> dorsal mesodermal tissues converge and extend {{on the inside of the}} gastrula, the presumptive posterior neural tissue converges and extends on the outside of the embryo, parallel to the underlying mesoderm, and then rolls up to form the neural tube, which later forms the hindbrain and spinal cord of the central nervous system". [...] Should convergent extension be interrupted or incomplete, the resulting organism will have a short anteroposterior axis, wide notochord, and broad, open neural tube.|$|E
5000|$|Hines will be sixty-seven {{this year}} and his style has become <b>involuted,</b> , and subtle {{to the point of}} elusiveness. It unfolds in orchestral layers and it demands intense listening. Despite the sheer mass of notes he now uses, his playing is never fatty. Hines may go along like this in a medium tempo blues. He will play the first two choruses softly and out of tempo, {{unreeling}} placid chords that safely hold the kernel of the melody. By the third chorus, he will have slid into a steady but implied beat and raised his volume. Then, using steady tenths in his left hand, he will stamp out a whole chorus of right-hand chords in between beats. He will vault into the upper register in the next chorus and wind through irregularly placed notes, while his left hand plays descending, on-the-beat, chords that pass through a forest of harmonic changes. (There are so many push-me, pull-you contrasts going on in such a chorus {{that it is impossible to}} grasp it one time through.) In the next chorus—bang!—up goes the volume again and Hines breaks into a crazy-legged double-time-and-a-half run that may make several sweeps up and down the keyboard and that are punctuated by offbeat single notes in the left hand. Then he will throw in several fast descending two-fingered glissandos, go abruptly into an arrhythmic swirl of chords and short, broken, runs and, as abruptly as he began it all, ease into an interlude of relaxed chords and poling single notes. But these choruses, which may be followed by eight or ten more before Hines has finished what he has to say, are irresistible in other ways. Each is a complete creation in itself, and yet each is lashed tightly to the next.|$|E
5000|$|The ancient Greeks portrayed Hypnos, Nyx and Thanatos, {{the gods}} of sleep, night and death, with {{the symbol of the}} poppy. The {{earliest}} written record appeared in the eighth century BC. Early Greek accounts seem to indicate the plant was used for euthanasia; on some Greek islands, women used it in old age to shorten the time left until natural death. Hippocrates (460-377 BC) {{was one of the first}} to emphasize the medicinal uses of the poppy and outline several methods of preparation. He described poppy juice as narcotic, hypnotic, and cathartic. He also recognized the plant’s uses as food, particularly the seeds. By the first century AD, Dioskorides wrote down the first poppy taxonomy. He distinguished between several different kinds, the first of which was the [...] "cultivated" [...] or [...] "garden" [...] poppies. He further distinguished two types within this category, ones with black and others with white seeds. Both had elongated capsules and the black-seeded variety was <b>involuted.</b> Historians speculate this variety was Papaver somniferum. Other species were in use, as well. Dioskorides named the “flowering” poppy as a type with strong hypnotic properties. This is believed to be Papaver hybridum. Finally, the “wild” poppy he described is believed to be Papaver orientale. Pliny the Elder, a Roman historian, later mentioned an “intermediate” type between the wild and cultivated poppy, likely Papaver rhoeas. He wrote about medical applications of the plant; the leaves and capsules were boiled in water to create juice, pressed and rubbed to create tablets, and the dried latex was used to form opium. These products were used in much the same way they are in many cultures today, to promote sleep and to relieve indigestion and respiratory problems.|$|E
50|$|Reviewers, from {{a variety}} of {{critical}} perspectives, are unanimous in noting that Steiner’s premature death was a loss to scholarship given the erudite trenchancy of his analytical acumen. Norman Snaith remarked that it was a tragedy ‘that he died before his own thinking reached a constructive stage.’ For S. G. F. Brandon, ‘(p)erhaps the fairest estimate of this book is to regard it as prolegomena to a great study of taboo which will, unhappily, not now be written by Franz Steiner’. Assessments of his style however vary. For Fred Cottrell, it was ‘very lucid and witty’. For Katherine Luomela, the book was ‘highly organized, closely reasoned, and tightly written’, though his ‘sentences are really so jammed with content as to make for rather slow and heavy going (reading) and often raise doubt as to one’s comprehension of his meaning’. S.G. F. Brandon, noting Evans-Pritchard’s remark on the way Steiner’s omnivorous erudition and fanatical search for comprehensiveness slowed the publication of his research, thought it ‘not an easy book to read, partly owing to that obscurity of expression which so often marks the writing of a scholar in a language of which he has an apparent command but which is not his native tongue.’ But it was precisely the compactness of his thought which endowed the work with peculiar value, for ‘in its analysis it is most thorough and no tacit assumption nor loose logic in argument is allowed to pass unexamined’. Joseph Politella, to the contrary, regarded the work as a ‘brilliant exposition, along historical and sociological lines, of the custom of taboo’. In Norman Snaith’s judgement, a proper appreciation of the book could not ignore the tragedy of Steiner’s personal life, as a victim of Nazi tyranny. In this sense, his criticisms of both Robertson Smith and Frazer as thinkers whose ideas were thoroughly embedded in the values of the period they themselves lived and worked in may be applied as a criterion, mutatis mutandis, to Steiner’s own work. ‘A naturally acute and critical mind has been sharpened to a razor-edge by his privations. This is why his criticisms are so severe, and occasionally super-punctilious. Cora DuBois characterized Steiner’s ‘critical reasoning’ as ‘subtle and <b>involuted,</b> at times to the point of obscurity, and the critical mood is predominantly captious’, but affirmed that, ‘(n)evertheless, these lectures are of a high intellectual order and occasionally possess passages of literary merit’.|$|E
40|$|BackgroundChanges in the {{composition}} of the extracellular matrix (ECM) occur between the proliferating and <b>involuted</b> phases of infantile hemangiomas (IH), and are associated with angiogenic growth. We examined {{the composition}} of the ECM in proliferating and <b>involuted</b> IHs and assessed correlations between the composition of the ECM and whether the IH was in the proliferating or the <b>involuted</b> phase. MethodsWe evaluated IH samples from a cohort of patients who had five proliferating IHs and five <b>involuted</b> IHs. The following ECM molecules were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunohistochemistry: laminin, fibronectin, collagen type I, collagen type II, and collagen type III. ResultsThe <b>involuted</b> IHs had higher levels of deposition of collagen type III than the proliferating IHs. The median values (interquartile ranges) were 1. 135 (0. 946 - 1. 486) and 1. 008 (0. 780 - 1. 166) (P= 0. 019), respectively. The level of laminin was higher in <b>involuted</b> IHs than in proliferating IHs, with median values (interquartile ranges) of 3. 191 (2. 945 - 3. 191) and 2. 479 (1. 699 - 3. 284) (P= 0. 047), respectively. Abundant collagen type III staining was found in <b>involuted</b> IHs. Laminin α 4 chain staining was clearly present within the basement membrane adjacent to the blood vessels, and was significantly more intense in <b>involuted</b> IHs than in proliferative IHs. ConclusionsInvoluted hemangiomas showed extensive deposition of collagen III and laminin, suggesting that differences {{in the composition}} of the ECM reflect stages of the development of IHs. This pattern {{may be due to the}} rapid senescence of IHs...|$|E
