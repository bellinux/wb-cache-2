500|$|Armillaria gallica is {{a weaker}} {{pathogen}} than the related A.Mellea or A.Solidipes, {{and is considered}} a secondary parasite—typically initiating infection only after the host's defenses have been weakened by insect defoliation, drought, or infection by another fungus. Fungal infection can lead to root rot or butt rot. As the diseased trees die, the wood dries, increasing the chance of catching fire after being struck by lightning. The resulting forest fire may in turn kill the species that killed the trees. Plants that are under water stress caused by dry soils or waterlogging {{are more susceptible to}} infection by A.gallica. It {{has been shown to be}} one of several Armillaria species responsible for widespread mortality of oak trees in the Arkansas Ozarks. The fungus has also been shown to infect Daylily in South Carolina, Northern <b>highbush</b> <b>blueberry</b> (Vaccinium corymbosum) in Italy and vineyards (Vitis species) of Rías Baixas in northwestern Spain. The latter infestation [...] "may be related to the fact that the vineyards from which they were isolated were located on cleared forestry sites". When A.solidipes and A.gallica co-occur in the same forest, infection of root systems by A.gallica may reduce damage or prevent infection from A.solidipes.|$|E

50|$|Southern Highbush Cultivars, in {{addition}} to lower chilling requirements, also have greater tolerance to high summer temperatures, somewhat greater drought tolerance and develop superior fruit quality under Southern U.S. growing conditions.

40|$|Ripening {{blueberries}} {{are subject}} to serious damage {{by a variety of}} bird species. Through a questionnaire survey, Pearson (1958) calculated that losses of <b>highbush</b> <b>blueberries</b> to birds in Massachusetts averaged about $ 38, 000 a year in 1955 - 57. From a 1972 questionnaire on bird damage to <b>highbush</b> <b>blueberries</b> directed to individuals in 14 states, Mott and Stone (1973) estimated that birds damaged at least 5 % of the crop, representing a minimum nationwide loss of about $ 1. 6 million. Most species of birds that feed on blueberries are not only desirable but also protected under the Migratory Bird Treaties Act. Any means of reducing this damage must therefore be nonlethal. Since the experimental insecticide, methiocarb [4 -methylthio) - 3, 5 -xylyl N-methylcarbamate], has recently proved to be an effective, nonlethal repellent for protecting cherries and grapes from damage by birds (Guarino, 1972; Guarino, et al., 1974), initial trials were conducted to determine if methiocarb would protect wild, lowbush blueberries (vaccinium angustifolium) from bird damage...|$|R

50|$|Although {{blueberries}} were traditionally hand-picked with berry-picking rakes, modern farmers use machine harvesters that {{shake the}} fruit off the bush of cultivated <b>highbush</b> <b>blueberries,</b> while new machines {{are being developed}} for wild, lowbush blueberries.

In Mexico, each farmer packs on site and sells directly, or may transport to a warehouse for storage until the berries are sold. Tunnels are often used to grow blueberries in Europe and this makes the season longer. This creates an opportunity to move crops into earlier or later markets to get better prices.|$|R

Between population variability in I. pepperi resistance was assessed by measuring length of the prereproductive period, fecundity, and survivorship on 14 V. darrowi accessions representing 11 discrete wild populations. Length of I. pepperi’s prereproductive period and survivorship were not significantly affected. However, differences were detected in fecundity and the intrinsic rate of increase (rm). Within population variability in resistance was measured by confining first instars to 24 accessions from a single wild population of V. darrowi (NJ 88 - 06). Significant differences in the mean total number of aphids occurring after 20 d were only detected between 2 of the 24 V. darrowi accessions. A greater degree of diversity in I. pepperi resistance exists between populations of V. darrowi compared to within a population. Constitutive leaf and stem polyphenolics were identified by HPLC-MS and quantified from 14 of the V. darrowi accessions. The accessions varied in concentration...|$|R
