5000|$|The VTM-4 system's {{electronic}} control unit (ECU) determines torque {{which is to be}} distributed to the rear wheels, then electric current is sent to the two electromagnetic coils. The resulting magnetic field moves a rotating steel plate toward each fixed coil. Friction between that steel plate and an adjoining cam plate causes the cam plate to begin turning. As it does, three balls per clutch roll up curved ramps, creating an axial thrust against a clutch-engagement plate. This thrust force compresses the wet clutch plates, thereby engaging drive to the corresponding rear wheel. [...] Unlike mechanically actuated four-wheel drive systems, the VTM-4 system is infinitely variable. The amount of torque provided to the rear wheels is directly proportional to the electric current sent from the ECU and can be adjusted from zero to a preset maximum. This current constantly changes to deliver the optimum rear torque calculated by the ECU. An <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> circulates VTM-4 fluid to cool and lubricate the clutches, bearings, and gears within the rear drive unit. Use of high-strength, low-weight materials such as diecast aluminum for the housing minimizes the bulk and weight of this hardware, helping to keep the weight of the entire all-wheel-drive system to about 212-pounds.|$|E
40|$|Scope of {{this work}} is to analyse {{potentials}} in terms of efficiency of two pump units belonging to two families: the first intervening on the maximum volume generated by variable volume chambers (e. g. a vane pump where eccentricity is varied), the second that changes the quantity of fluid being sucked or delivered (e. g. a gear pump with variable timing). In more detail the comparison will be established between a vane pump where displacement is varied through eccentricity and an <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> of Gerotor type where flow rate is controlled through a rotating sector that alters the effective geometry of kidney ports.

40|$|This master’s thesis {{deals with}} a new design of an oil pump for Tatra T 158 {{transfer}} case. The new solution should replace earlier involute <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> which {{is not able to}} provide sufficent lubrication. The main problem of the old design is a poor suction at low speeds of the vehicle. Gerotor type of the pump has been chosen. Its main advantages are a convenient specific flow rate and good volumetric efficency. In an analytic calculation of the pump gearing also important functional parameters have been checked, like a pressure angle, flow rate, flow irregularity, specific flow rate, specific slipping. A design with and without axial clearance compensation is introduced. Measurements on a test rig confirmed good suction ability even in low revs. Generated flow rate and pressure are improved. That is a good prerequisite for faster assembly of transfer case with no testing of each oil pump. The tests have not revealed any unexpected wear of parts of the pump so far. It is supposed an application of the new gerotor design in a serial production of T 158 truck and other types in the future...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGenerally speaking, {{hydraulic}} control {{systems can be}} divided into two different driving concepts. The first one is the well-known valve-controlled system and the second one is the pump-controlled system. The former possesses the feature of fast dynamic response. However, the poor energy-saving performance is its major fault. On the contrary, the pump-controlled hydraulic system has the significant advantage of energy-saving which meets the current demand in modern machine design. In this paper, the simulation analysis using Matlab/Simulink and DSHplus for a newly developed energy-saving hydraulic tube bender is conducted. Instead of the conventional fixed displacement hydraulic pump, the new hydraulic tube bender utilizes an <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> with AC servomotor as its driving power source. In the new energy-saving hydraulic circuit, the use of conventional pressure relief valve is no longer necessary since the demanded flow-rate and pressure output can be precisely obtained by continuously changing the speed of the AC servomotor. In addition, from the simulation results, it is shown that the energy-saving performance of load-sensing control scheme is somewhat better than that of constant pressure control scheme. Furthermore, the simulation results also show that the newly developed hydraulic tube bender can save up to 40 % of energy consumption in a working cycle as compared to the conventional hydraulic tube bender...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of air bubbles inside an internal gears pump usually leads to fast pump damage and breaking. When bubbles enter the {{high pressure chamber}} they may implode releasing pressure waves in the fluid that ultimately detach material from the gears and other crucial pump parts. This paper recalls and describes the activities performed {{in order to develop}} a condition monitoring system able to indicate the {{presence of}} air bubbles in an <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> that feeds the hydraulic system of a packaging machine: this pump experienced a breakdown after only 3 minutes of air bubbles flowing in it. Since the machine is supposed to work continuously, an unexpected stop has heavy consequences in terms of loss of production time: therefore the machine producer decided to implement the condition monitoring (CM) of the pump. The producer’s goal is to use the warnings/alarms generated by the CM algorithm as a supplemental machine control signal: this may eventually command the stop of the machine to preserve it (and consequently the machine functionality) from fast damaging. The main phases of the development had been: data recording and analysis, diagnostic parameters identification, algorithm development and final algorithm validation in field tests. The data recording campaign included the simultaneous acquisition of 14 quantities of 5 different kinds (vibration, pressure, temperature, electrical torque and angular speed). The data analysis highlighted one of the vibration signals as the most significant to be monitored. Several signal features were analysed from the in order to evaluate their diagnostic capability point of view (i. e. : the ability to detect the presence of air bubbles in the pump); five features are used by the CM algorithm for the bubbles warning/alarm generation, these being the RMS, the bandpass filtered signal RMS, the Signal Entropy, the Spectral Mean Square Error and the Spectral Cumulative Difference. Currently, the algorithm is being tested and validated on recorded data and a field test campaign is being schedule...|$|E

50|$|For {{simplicity}} and reliability, mechanical pumps are used, driven by mechanical geartrains from the crankshaft. Reducing pump speed is beneficial {{and so it}} is usual to drive the pump from the cam (if this is mounted in the cylinder block) or distributor shaft, which turns at half engine speed. Placing the oil pump low-down uses a near-vertical drive shaft, driven by helical skew gears from the camshaft. Some engines, such as the Fiat twin cam engine of 1964, began as OHV engines with an oil pump driven from a conventional camshaft in the cylinder block. When the twin overhead cam engine was developed, the previous oil pump arrangement was retained and the camshaft became a shortened stub shaft. Even when the distributor position was moved from the previous block-mount to being mounted on the cylinder head camshafts, the oil pump drive remained in the same position, the unused distributor position now covered by a blanking plate.

40|$|External spur <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{exceedingly}} useful {{components in}} common hydraulic systems. The main issue with external <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> {{is that all}} current models are limited to only fixed-displacement. This means that for every revolution of the <b>gears</b> inside the <b>pump,</b> a set amount of fluid will always be displaced. Consequently, external <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> are limited in their use because they can only operate at full throttle causing inefficiencies when reduced displacement is needed. The successful procurement of a variable displacement <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> will allow a more efficient use of hydraulic systems, {{such as in the}} displacement controlled systems used in some heavy construction equipment. In this research approach, the displacement is varied by changing the timing of the <b>gears</b> inside the <b>pump.</b> More specifically, changing the timing of the gears’ connections with the inlet and outlet grooves alters the available volume in the gears’ spaces, subsequently varying the displacement. With this in mind, additional research was conducted to develop an actuation system for the aforementioned process. This includes the design of new gears, bearing blocks, and additional hydraulics for use in a modified existing commercial pump. Simulations have shown the implementation of the design allowed for a 67 % reduction in displacement, and thus successful introduction of variable displacement into an external <b>gear</b> <b>pump.</b> Additional {{research is needed to determine}} the optimal designs for the actuation system and variable displacement concept used in the <b>gear</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Gear</b> <b>pumps</b> (with {{external}} teeth) (fixed displacement) {{are simple}} and economical pumps. The swept volume or displacement of <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> for hydraulics will be between about 1 and 200 millilitres. They {{have the lowest}} volumetric efficiency ( [...] ) of all three basic <b>pump</b> types (<b>gear,</b> vane and piston pumps) These pumps create pressure through the meshing of the gear teeth, which forces fluid around the gears to pressurize the outlet side. For lubrication, the <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> uses {{a small amount of}} oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the <b>pump</b> housing. Some <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> can be quite noisy, compared to other types, but modern <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> are highly reliable and much quieter than older models. This is in part due to designs incorporating split gears, helical gear teeth and higher precision/quality tooth profiles that mesh and unmesh more smoothly, reducing pressure ripple and related detrimental problems. Another positive attribute of the <b>gear</b> <b>pump,</b> is that catastrophic breakdown is a lot less common than in most other types of hydraulic pumps. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the pump gradually until it is all but useless.
