25|$|The de Ménils, however, did {{not limit}} their {{acquisitions}} to modern art, and their eclectic tastes became {{a hallmark of}} their collecting practices. As modernists, they recognized the profound formal and spiritual connections between contemporary works {{of art and the}} arts of ancient and indigenous cultures, broadening their collection to include works from classical Mediterranean and Byzantine cultures, as well as objects from Africa, Oceania, and the Pacific Northwest. Influenced by the teachings of Father Couturier and Father Congar, the de Menils developed a particular humanist ethos in which they understood art as a central part of the human experience. Their collection was motivated by their shared interest in the many ways individuals over different cultures and eras reveal through art their understanding of what <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>human.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both ecofeminism {{and deep}} ecology {{put forward a}} new {{conceptualization}} of the self. Some ecofeminists, such as Marti Kheel, argue that self-realization and identification with all nature places {{too much emphasis on}} the whole, {{at the expense of the}} independent being. Similarly, some ecofeminists place more emphasis on the problem of androcentrism rather than anthropocentrism. To others, like Karen J. Warren, the domination of women is tethered conceptually and historically to the domination of nature. Ecofeminism denies abstract individualism and embraces the interconnectedness of the living world; relationships, including our relationship with non-human nature, are not extrinsic to our identity and are essential in defining what <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>human.</b> Warren argues that hierarchical classifications in general, such as racism or speciesism, are all forms of discrimination and are no different from sexism. Thus, anthropocentrism is simply another form of discrimination as a result of our flawed value structure and should be abolished.|$|E
25|$|For Shakespeare as {{he began}} to write, both traditions were alive; they were, moreover, {{filtered}} through the recent success of the University Wits on the London stage. By the late 16th century, the popularity of morality and academic plays waned as the English Renaissance took hold, and playwrights like Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe revolutionised theatre. Their plays blended the old morality drama with classical theory to produce a new secular form. The new drama combined the rhetorical complexity of the academic play with the bawdy energy of the moralities. However, it was more ambiguous and complex in its meanings, and less concerned with simple allegory. Inspired by this new style, Shakespeare continued these artistic strategies, creating plays that not only resonated on an emotional level with audiences but also explored and debated the basic elements of what <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>human.</b> What Marlowe and Kyd did for tragedy, John Lyly and George Peele, among others, did for comedy: they offered models of witty dialogue, romantic action, and exotic, often pastoral location that formed the basis of Shakespeare's comedic mode throughout his career.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode title}} [...] "Do Shapeshifters Dream of Electric Sheep" [...] {{refers to the}} Philip K.

While Peter is drinking in a bar, science fiction movie The Invisible Boy is playing on a television in the background, with the character Robby the Robot visible.

And then we launch something exciting for the back half...the promise of more to come." [...] Whedon added that [...] "though we do break the season up, we feel that the season as a whole is one arc" [...] and so the series would explore the same themes in the second half, [...] "themes of what <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>human</b> and Inhuman. What does it mean to all these people when they have to live with their actions? Are they capable of the things their enemies are capable of?...What is the true nature of a person?

[...] She stated that the episode [...] "played to its strengths, namely Eve Myles' Gwen and how she relates to both human and alien" [...] and stated it to demonstrate [...] "how perfect Rhys is for Gwen". She felt that the episode was flawed in its [...] "cop-out" [...] ending and Jack's handling of Gwen but in her conclusion noted it be [...] "the first episode of Torchwood that left me choked up, crying with Gwen at the end". Airlock Alpha's Alan Stanley Blair felt the episode to be a vast improvement on its predecessors stating it be [...] "hard hitting, edgy and explores much bleaker and darker avenues to life in Torchwood". He also felt that the personal effect of Gwen's struggles on her domestic life {{was one of the most}} interesting aspects comparing it to the television series Angel which [...] "touched on some of these threads through the meta-story and vampire mythology" [...] but not [...] "on the scale of this [...] ". He concluded that the episode's conclusion was both to its credit and its biggest disappointment because it showed that there is [...] "no way to make everything all right" [...] but left its audience [...] "screaming for a happy ending that will never come". Jason Hughes of AOL TV was more mixed in his review. He felt that the episode was a [...] "vast improvement over last week's episode" [...] and stated that it lived up to Torchwoods reputation as [...] "the darker, more mature cousin of Doctor Who". However, he stated that the episode had [...] "some logistical problems" [...] and [...] "at least one ridiculously convenient coincidence that the emotional hook of the episode hinged on". He praised the [...] "tragic emotional impact of the moment when Jonah's mom told Gwen to promise her not to do that to any other families" [...] and stated that he liked [...] "that there weren't any easy answers". io9's Charlie Jane Anders described [...] "Adrift" [...] as [...] "easily the best episode of the Doctor Who spin-off since the one where Martha Jones showed up". She stated that [...] "the fact that it offered no easy solutions and gave us that super-bleak ending was enough to win me over".|$|E

2500|$|The term hermeneutics is {{typically}} traced to Hermes, {{who was the}} messenger of the gods in Greek mythology: a messenger whose sole purpose was to interpret {{the will of the}} gods to man. However, the actual etymology of the word, although disputed, comes from the Greek verb [...] which directly refers to interpretation. Hermeneutics became a discipline for interpreting religious scripture and folk literature around the 15th ψentury, A.D., and was later adopted as a theoretical discipline for the human sciences in the 19th century. The man most directly responsible its adoption was Wilhelm Dilthey. Dilthey was followed by a succession of philosophers and psychologists, such as Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Binswanger, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Paul Ricœur, Charles Taylor, Brent D. Slife, Frank C. Richardson, Timothy J. Zeddies, Jack Martin & Jeff Sugaran, John C. Christopher, and David Polizzi, who built upon his efforts to use hermeneutics as a way of studying and theorizing about human nature, as well as developing it as a counseling theory. The use of hermeneutics as a sub-discipline to understand the fundamental nature of humanity invoked the term ontological, from the study of ontology, which is simply a way of saying the way something is or, the way something exists. It follows then that ontological hermeneutics is the theory and art of interpreting human nature: namely, what <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>human</b> {{and what it means to}} have experiences.|$|E

2500|$|Blade Runner, {{the first}} film in the franchise, is a 1982 neo-noir science fiction film, serving as a loose {{adaptation}} of the Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. The film {{is set in a}} dystopian Los Angeles of 2019, in which genetically bioengineered replicants, which are visually indistinguishable from adult humans, are manufactured by the Tyrell Corporation to work on off-world colonies. Those that escape and return to Earth are hunted down and [...] "retired" [...] by special police operatives known as [...] "blade runners". The story focuses on burnt-out expert blade runner Rick Deckard, who reluctantly agrees to take on one last assignment to hunt down a group of recently escaped replicants led by Roy Batty. During his investigations, Deckard meets Rachael, an advanced experimental replicant who causes him to question his attitude towards replicants and what <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>human.</b> Starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, and Edward James Olmos, it was released in the United States on June 25, 1982. It underperformed in North American theaters, but has since become a cult film. The year following its release, the film won the prestigious Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Hailed for its production design, depicting a [...] "retrofitted" [...] future, it remains a leading example of neo-noir cinema. The film's soundtrack, composed by Vangelis, was critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a BAFTA and Golden Globe as best original score. In 1993, the movie was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, being deemed [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". Blade Runner is now regarded by many critics as one of the all-time best science fiction films.|$|E
