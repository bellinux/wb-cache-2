40|$|Abstract. It is {{important}} {{to develop a new}} special material to satisfy the requirement of producing capacitor with higher property. BZT(Ba(ZrxTi 1 -x) O 3) ceramics of La 2 O 3 and Sm 2 O 3 doped was fabricated by the conventional method of solid reaction. These ceramics were tested by X-ray diffraction (XRD), <b>Impedance</b> <b>Tester,</b> and LCR Tester with temperature controlling systems. The results indicate that dielectric property of BZT ceramics doped 0. 05 mol % La 2 O 3, 0. 2 mol % Sm 2 O 3 simultaneously and calcined in 1280 â„ƒ is the best. Moreover, it was found that Sm 2 O 3 had the functions of moving Tc of matrix material to a low temperature and making the peak wider...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device for the high-sensitivity resolution non-destructive examination of magnetic Barkhausen {{noise in the}} surface area of a unit under test, said device consisting of an induction sensor which consists of a ferro-magnetic core with two core parts separated by a launch gap {{and at least one}} induction coil, whereby the core of the induction sensors tapers to a point in the external mouth area of the launch gap, and a ranging sensor is provided for measuring the distance between the induction sensor and the surface of the unit under test, and the distance between the induction sensor and the surface of the unit under test is adjustable by means of a distance adjuster, whereby an <b>impedance</b> <b>tester</b> is provided and the induction sensor is excited by an alternating field...|$|E
