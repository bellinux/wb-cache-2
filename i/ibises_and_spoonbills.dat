50|$|Aransas National Wildlife Refuge is a 114,657 acre (464 km2) {{protected}} area {{situated on the}} southwest side of San Antonio Bay along the Gulf Coast of the U.S. state of Texas. It is located in parts of Aransas, Refugio, and Calhoun counties. The Aransas National Wildlife Refuge was established by Executive Order 7784 on 31 December 1937 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as the Aransas Migratory Waterfowl Refuge as a refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife. The name was changed in 1939.Bird life includes ducks, herons, egrets, <b>ibises,</b> roseate <b>spoonbills,</b> <b>and</b> the endangered whooping crane, whose population has recovered significantly since the 1940s.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] {{area of the}} floodplain, {{defined as}} the maximum area of {{contemporary}} flooding, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it has supported up to 650,000 waterbirds during times of major flooding, and regularly supports over 1% of the world populations of black swans, freckled ducks, pink-eared ducks, grey teals, Australasian shovelers, straw-necked <b>ibises,</b> yellow-billed <b>spoonbills</b> <b>and</b> white-headed stilts. [...] Other birds that have been recorded in large numbers include whiskered terns and Eurasian coots. Reduced inundation of the floodplain, {{through the construction of}} water management works, has resulted in waterbird numbers dropping by 90%, from an average of 140,000 in 1983-86 to 14,000 in 1998-2001.|$|R

500|$|The family Ardeidae {{contains}} the herons, egrets, and bitterns. Herons and egrets are wading birds with long necks and legs. Herons {{are large and}} egrets are smaller. The cattle egret or [...] "cow bird" [...] is seen amongst flocks of cattle, for instance in ranches north of the Everglades. A bird will often attach itself to a particular bull, cow or calf, even being tolerated perching on the back or even {{the head of the}} animal. The birds are more shy than the animals, and will fly away if approached. The birds feed on various items turned over by the cattle as they graze and tramp the ground. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more secretive. Unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, <b>ibises,</b> <b>and</b> <b>spoonbills,</b> members of the Ardeidae fly with their necks pulled back into a curve.|$|E
40|$|Large {{numbers of}} colonially nesting herons, egrets, <b>ibises,</b> storks <b>and</b> <b>spoonbills</b> {{were one of}} the {{defining}} natural phenomena of the historical Everglades. Reproduction of these species has been tracked over at least a century, and some clear responses to dramatic anthropogenic hydrological alterations have been established. These include a marked decline in nesting populations of several species, and a movement of colonies away from the over-drained estuarine region. Ponding in {{a large portion of the}} freshwater marsh has favored species that hunt by sight in deep water (egrets, cf. 25 – 45 cm), while tactile feeders (<b>ibises</b> <b>and</b> storks) that depend on concentrated prey in shallow water (5 – 25 cm) have become proportionately much less common. There has been a marked increase in the interval between exceptionally large breeding aggregations of White Ibises (Eudocimus albus). Loss of short hydroperiod wetlands on the margins of the Everglades have delayed nest initiations 1 – 2 months by Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) resulting in poor nesting success. These responses are consistent with mechanisms that involve foraging, and the availability and production of prey animals, and each of the relationships is highly dependent on hydrology. Here, we define a group of characteristics about wading bird dynamics (= indicators) that collectively track the specific ecological relationships that supported <b>ibises</b> <b>and</b> storks in the past. We suggest four metrics as indicators of restoration success: timing of nesting by storks, the ratio of nesting ibises + storks to Great Egrets, the proportion of all nests located in the estuarine/freshwater ecotone, and the interval between years with exceptionally large ibis nestings. Each of these metrics has historical (e. g., predrainage) data upon which to base expectations for restoration, and the metrics have little measurement error relative to the large annual variation in numbers of nests. In addition to the strong scientific basis for the use of these indicators, wading birds are also a powerful tool for public communication because they have strong aesthetic appeal, and their ecological relationships with water are intuitively understandable. In the interests of communicating with the public and decision-makers, we integrate these metrics into a single-page annual “traffic-light” report card for wading bird responses. Collectively, we believe these metrics offer an excellent chance of detecting restoration of the ecosystem functions that supported historical wading bird nesting patterns...|$|R
50|$|The family Threskiornithidae {{includes}} 34 {{species of}} large wading birds.

60|$|The {{terrestrial}} dances, {{often very}} elaborate, of heavy birds, {{like those of}} the gallinaceous kind, are represented in the more volatile species by performances in the air, and these are very much more beautiful; while {{a very large number of}} birds--hawks, vultures, swifts, swallows, nightjars, storks, <b>ibises,</b> <b>spoonbills,</b> <b>and</b> gulls--circle about in the air, singly or in flocks. Sometimes, in serene weather, they rise to a vast altitude, and float about in one spot for an hour or longer at a stretch, showing a faint bird-cloud in the blue, that does not change its form, nor grow lighter and denser like a flock of starlings; but in the seeming confusion there is perfect order, and amidst many hundreds each swift- or slow-gliding figure keeps its proper distance with such exactitude that no two ever touch, even with the extremity of the long-wings, flapping or motionless:--such a multitude, and such miraculous precision in the endless curving motions of all the members of it, that the spectator can lie for an hour on his back without weariness watching this mystic cloud-dance in the empyrean.|$|R
