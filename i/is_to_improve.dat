As Parkinson's is not a curable disease, all treatments are focused on slowing decline and improving quality of life, and are therefore palliative in nature.|$|E

This {{part of the project}} will be built in 2008 and is to include new turn lanes at each intersection. To the south, the Rexford Bridge over the Mohawk River and the surrounding roadway will be improved in stages, with completion expected by 2017. The objective of these projects <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> highway capacity and safety along the corridor.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} {{baseball}} {{require that the}} official scorer view the game only from the press box, for two basic reasons. First, this ensures that every scorer has nearly the same perspective of the game. One of the intentions of this rule <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> consistency in scorekeeping decisions between different official scorers working on different games at the same stadium, and between scorers in different stadiums. Second, the press box is the most neutral position within the stadium. Seated in the press box, the official scorer is surrounded by writers and broadcasters who are ostensibly neutral, and the scorer {{is less likely to}} be unduly influenced by the players, the coaches, and the crowd.|$|E
5|$|A {{more complex}} example of stepped {{impedance}} design {{is presented in}} figure 6. Again, narrow lines are used to implement inductors and wide lines correspond to capacitors, but in this case, the lumped-element counterpart has resonators connected in shunt across the main line. This topology {{can be used to}} design elliptical filters or Chebyshev filters with poles of attenuation in the stopband. However, calculating component values for these structures is an involved process and has led to designers often choosing to implement them as m-derived filters instead, which perform well and are much easier to calculate. The purpose of incorporating resonators <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> the stopband rejection. However, beyond the resonant frequency of the highest frequency resonator, the stopband rejection starts to deteriorate as the resonators are moving towards open-circuit. For this reason, filters built to this design often have an additional single stepped-impedance capacitor as the final element of the filter. This also ensures good rejection at high frequency.|$|E

5|$|Service design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of service design. It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> {{the quality of the}} service, the interaction between the service provider and its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size of the service sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive and to continue to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses in the design and development of manufactured products; service design managers can apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of service design helps the business gain competitive advantages and conquer new markets. Companies that proactively identify the interests of their customers and use this information to develop services that create good experiences for the customer will open up new and profitable business opportunities.|$|E
