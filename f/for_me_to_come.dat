Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.|$|E
25|$|When Mark Coleman got {{injured and}} had {{to drop out of}} his matchup against Tito Ortiz, Griffin {{accepted}} a rematch against Ortiz at UFC 106. Griffin also wore white and black fight shorts instead of his trademark tan shorts for the fight. Griffin {{went on to win the}} gory battle by split decision, showing superior striking skills and a stronger ground game than in their previous fight. After the fight Griffin said, “Tito was a great fight <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back, we’ll have to do a third that’s 1-1 man.” With a split decision in both of their fights, Griffin seemed more than willing to get a rubber match put together with Ortiz to settle the score once and for all. “You could tell he was a guy getting ready for Mark Coleman, no offense, and he’s a guy coming off back surgery. We’ll do it again, I won’t break my foot, he’ll be in better shape,” commented Griffin.|$|E
500|$|Federer {{defeated}} Nadal in five compelling sets {{in three}} hours and forty-five minutes, for a fifth consecutive Wimbledon championship (equalling the feat achieved by Björn Borg). Borg himself returned to Wimbledon {{for the first time}} since losing the final in 1981, saying [...] "I just feel that this is the right time <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back, to hopefully watch Roger winning his fifth title in a row to match my record." [...] This match marked only the third time in the new century that a Major final had gone to five sets, and was the first time the technology Hawk-Eye was ever used in a Wimbledon final.|$|E

500|$|Osbourne {{initially}} {{set out to}} form a solo project featuring former Dirty Tricks members John Frazer-Binnie, Terry Horbury, and Andy Bierne. As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had {{a change}} of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. [...] "Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band", Iommi explained. [...] "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with the ideas and putting them together that quick." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the Volume 4 world tour, Black Sabbath {{returned}} to Los Angeles {{to begin work}} on their next release. Pleased with the Volume 4 album, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and {{returned to}} the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles. With new musical innovations of the era, the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a [...] "giant synthesiser". The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973, but in part because of substance issues and fatigue, they were unable to complete any songs. [...] "Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on Volume 4 and we really got discontent" [...] Iommi said. [...] "Everybody was sitting there waiting <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with something. I just couldn't think of anything.

500|$|In July 2014, Owumi re-signed {{with the}} Worcester Wolves {{for a third}} season. He commented, [...] "It was an easy {{decision}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back to Worcester, the club and city support everything I'm doing {{on and off the}} court. Next season should be exciting, I'm looking forward to building on it." [...] During the offseason, the Wolves had seen the departures of key players Zaire Taylor and Will Creekmore. To open the season on September 26, 2014, Owumi recorded 10 points, six rebounds, seven assists, and three steals in a win over the Newcastle Eagles. On October 24, he scored a season-high 33 points, making all six of his three-point attempts, to beat the Leeds Force, 98–69. Owumi became his team's all-time leader in three-pointers, passing Daniel Gilbert for a total of 169. He collected five three-pointers in another 30-point game on December 14, as Worcester fell to the Cheshire Phoenix. On April 26, 2015 in the BBL Play-off quarterfinals, Owumi posted a double-double of 18 points and ten rebounds but his team was eliminated by the London Lions, 67–106. He capped the season averaging 16.4 points, 6.0 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1.1 steals per game.|$|E

500|$|When Arsenal {{moved to}} the Emirates Stadium, the club prioritised repaying the loans over {{strengthening}} the playing squad. Arsenal's self-sustaining model relied heavily on qualifying for the UEFA Champions League; as Wenger recalled in 2016: [...] "We had to be {{three years in the}} Champions League out of five and have an average of 54,000 people, and we didn’t know we would be capable of that." [...] The club sold several experienced players throughout the late 2000s and early 2010s and raised ticket prices, upsetting supporters who have called for change. Wenger took umbrage over criticism and revealed the bank loans were contingent on his commitment to the club: [...] "The banks wanted the technical consistency to guarantee that {{we have a chance to}} pay [...] back. I did commit and I stayed and under very difficult circumstances. So <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back and on top of that [...] reproach me for not having won the championship during that period it is a bit overboard." [...] Wenger later described the stadium move as the toughest period of his life because of the restricted finances in place.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} verse, Beyoncé resigns herself and {{continues}} to sing about cruelties that men often inflict on women. Still imagining herself impersonating {{the man who has}} wronged her, she highlights how some men switch off their phones to avoid ex-lovers after having found another girl. Beyoncé continues, [...] "I'd put myself first / And make the rules as I go / 'Cause I know that she'd be faithful / Waitin' <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> home". She then repeats the chorus; the intensity with which she sings gradually increases until she hits her upper register and seems close to crying. During the bridge, Beyoncé stops singing about the male behaviors she would indulge in if she were a man and addresses her callous lover directly. As Beyoncé emphasizes how it feels to be cheated on, she sings her vocal lines an octave higher than she did {{in the rest of the}} song. She finally tells him that it is too late to come back and apologize. In the last verse, Beyoncé concludes, [...] "But you're just a boy". Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music notes that she [...] " [...] her voice into a thin, pleading whine" [...] at this point. With a squeak in her voice, she repeats the chorus for the final time as she fights to remain strong, not allowing her agony to bring her down.|$|E
500|$|The Cassandra Cain {{version of}} Batgirl, {{depicted}} as a biracial character (Half White and half Chinese), is notable {{as one of the}} most prominent characters of Asian descent to appear in American comic books. Jeffrey A. Brown states that while her ethnicity is rarely mentioned in the comic books, Asian women have had a long history in comics of being portrayed as martial artists and are often exploited as sex objects. However, in the case of Batgirl, [...] "Cassandra's racial identity is treated more implicitly than explicitly. Her costume design actually conceals her entire body so that while in her guise as Batgirl her ethnicity is completely unapparent." [...] The fact that her sexuality is also understated represents a shift away from the typical portrayals of women, and Asian women in particular. The most controversial aspect of her character came about during the One Year Later event, when she is reintroduced as a villain. The abrupt shift in her character brought about negative criticism from readership. When questioned about the change in characterization, writer Adam Beechen stated: [...] "They didn't present me with a rationale as to why Cassandra was going to change, or a motivating factor. That was left <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with and them to approve. And we did that. But as far as to why the editors and writers and whoever else made the decision decided that was a good direction, I honestly couldn't answer." ...|$|E

500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is waiting <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's {{waiting for you to}} come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 8 March 1932, Puyi {{made his}} {{ceremonial}} entry into Changchun, sharing his car with Zheng who was beaming with joy, Amakasu whose expression was stern as usual, and Wanrong, who looked miserable. Puyi remembered about {{his first time}} in Changchun: [...] "I saw Japanese gendarmes, and rows of people, wearing all sots of clothes; some were in Chinese jackets and gowns, some were in Western suits and some in traditional Japanese dress, {{and they were all}} holding small flags in their hands. I was thrilled and reflected that I was now seeing the scene that I missed at the harbor. As I walked past them Hsi Hsia [...] pointed out a line of dragon flags between the Japanese ones and said that the men holding them were all Manchu [...] "bannermen" [...] who had been waiting <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> for twenty years. These words brought tears to my eyes, and I was more strongly convinced than ever that my future was very hopeful". Puyi also noted he was [...] "too preoccupied with my hopes and hates" [...] to realize the [...] "cold comfort that the Changchun citizens, silent from terror and hatred, were giving me". Puyi's friend, the British journalist Woodhead, who covered his arrival in Manchuria, wrote [...] "outside official circles, I met no Chinese who felt any enthusiasm for the new regime", and that the city of Harbin was being terrorized by Chinese and Russian gangsters working for the Japanese, making Harbin [...] "lawless... even its main street unsafe after dark". In an interview with Woodhead, Puyi stated he planned to govern Manchukuo “in the Confucian spirit” and he was “perfectly happy” with his new position. An Italian journalist from the Corriere della Sera newspaper wrote: “I was unable to interview this pale, tired prince who doesn’t’ like to talk, who is always plunged in his meditations and who maybe regrets his life as a simple, studious citizen. He has a fixed stare behind his black-framed glasses. When we were introduced, he responded with a friendly nod. But his smile lasted only a second. We could only await the word of the Master of Ceremonies to give us permission to bow ourselves out. A Japanese colonel, our guide, showed us the triumphal arches, the electric light decorations and endless flags. But all this, say the shopkeepers is [...] "made in Osaka"”.|$|E
