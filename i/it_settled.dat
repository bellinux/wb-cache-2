5|$|Henry III {{added to}} the {{endowment}} left by Peter des Roches, donating farmland, urban property in Southampton and elsewhere, and spiritual revenues from churches. By 1291, taxation returns show that the abbey had a clear annual revenue of £81, a comfortable income. However, shortly afterwards a period of bad management resulted in the abbey accruing substantial debts, and it was soon almost bankrupt. In 1328 the government was forced to appoint an administrator, John of Mere, to address the crisis. Despite forcing the abbot to apply revenues to debt repayment and to sell many of the estates, the operation was only partly successful. Ten years later the abbey was again appealing to the king for help with a disastrous financial situation. The monks blamed their problems {{on the cost of}} providing hospitality to the many travellers by sea, and the king's sailors who landed at the abbey. The king provided some small grants enabling the abbey to overcome its difficulties but the property sales meant that the abbey's income never recovered and <b>it</b> <b>settled</b> into what has been described as genteel poverty.|$|E
5|$|On June 13, 1781, Nicola and the Invalid Corps {{was given}} the order by Congress to move to West Point, New York. This, however, was {{difficult}} to accomplish. On June 26, Nicola {{wrote a letter to}} George Washington that the Corps would not move until a replacement unit could take over for them. Another reason hindering the move was pay; the Corps did not receive a payment for nearly ten months. A compromise was later reached between Nicola and the Board of War that six months pay would be given to the Invalid Corps. After their leave to Pennsylvania, John David Woelper, a captain of the Invalid Corps, sent a letter to Washington on July 20, 1781 claiming Nicola was treating the Corps badly. In the note, Woelper requested Nicola's arrest. Nicola sent letters about the situation to Washington, who wanted to have <b>it</b> <b>settled</b> as soon as the Corps arrived at West Point. Washington, who did not show any favoritism to either, sent both series of letters to General Alexander McDougall and asked the court in West Point to settle the matter.|$|E

5|$|McCann {{enlisted in}} the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 24 August 1914 at Morphettville, South Australia. He was allotted to the South Australian-raised 10th Battalion, part of the 3rd Brigade, as a private with the regimental number 405. Within a week he had been {{promoted}} to sergeant. The battalion embarked for overseas in October, and sailed via Albany, Western Australia, to Egypt, arriving in early December. While the force was training in Egypt he was appointed as a platoon sergeant in the battalion's D Company. After completing training, the 3rd Brigade was designated as the covering force for the landing at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, on 25 April 1915, {{and so was the}} first brigade ashore about 4:30 am. Four days later McCann was appointed as company sergeant major. During that period, the 10th Battalion suffered casualties of 13 officers and 453 men. On 19 May the battalion helped fight off a concerted Turkish counter-attack against the landing force, after which <b>it</b> <b>settled</b> into a routine of rotating through various positions in the line. Due to his outstanding service during the period 6 May to 28 June McCann was mentioned several times in Australian and New Zealand Army Corps routine orders. In July, McCann and most of the battalion had a three day rest on the island of Imbros, but were quickly back in the trenches at Anzac. McCann was commissioned in the rank of second lieutenant on 4 August, by which time nearly half of the battalion had been evacuated sick with dysentery. He was promoted to lieutenant on 14 November. McCann remained at Anzac, serving as battalion intelligence and signalling officer, until the unit was withdrawn to the island of Lemnos in late November, followed by evacuation to Egypt the following month.|$|E

In the early 19th century, miners in Cornwall were enduring economic hardships. Ships carrying 125 passengers and some 1,500 tons of equipment sailed out of Falmouth, Cornwall, landing in Veracruz three months later. The treacherous 500-kilometre (300mi) trek inland killed about half of the miners and their family members, many succumbing to malaria and yellow fever.

It too was eventually pushed back into the Falaise Pocket.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the 90-minute format was intended to be temporary, with the added time used to prepare a storyline for a spinoff, Texas in 1980.

Texas, starring the hugely popular Beverlee McKinsey and attempting {{to cash in on the}} Dallas craze, while itself not a success, may have caused further erosion of Another World viewership, to the point that it was no longer NBC's highest-rated serial, losing that position to Days of our Lives (which itself, along with the rest of NBC's daytime lineup, was in serious ratings trouble). Another World fell from eighth to as low as 11th in the ratings chart, and by the 1981–1982 television season it sunk so low in the Nielsens to 4.7 (a drop of 3.9 points in four seasons). Much like General Hospital winning the 3/2 slot for ABC, One Life to Live came in strong at 2/1, with CBS attempting to get its new Capitol off the ground during that period.|$|E
