50|$|<b>Exponential</b> <b>smoothing</b> {{and moving}} average have similar defects of {{introducing}} a lag {{relative to the}} input data. While this can be corrected by shifting the result by half the window length for a symmetrical kernel, such as a moving average or gaussian, {{it is unclear how}} appropriate this would be for <b>exponential</b> <b>smoothing.</b> They also both have roughly the same distribution of forecast error when α = 2/(k+1). They differ in that <b>exponential</b> <b>smoothing</b> takes into account all past data, whereas moving average only takes into account k past data points. Computationally speaking, they also differ in that moving average requires that the past k data points be kept, whereas <b>exponential</b> <b>smoothing</b> only needs the most recent forecast value to be kept.|$|E

Empirical results demonstrate that the ESTECM-GARCH captures the dynamics of returns more effectively than the Error-Correction Model (ECM) and <b>Exponential</b> <b>Smooth</b> Transition Error-Correction Model (ESTECM).

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} out-of-sample {{forecasting}} {{performance of a}} number of prominent nonlinear models of U. S. dollar real exchange rate behavior from the extant empirical literature. Our analysis entails a comparison of point, interval, and density forecasts generated by nonlinear and linear autoregressive models. Using monthly data from the post-Bretton Woods period, there is fairly little evidence that favors either band-threshold or <b>exponential</b> <b>smooth</b> transition autoregressive models over simple linear autoregressive models in terms of out-of-sample forecasting performance. Most of the evidence in support of nonlinear autoregressive specifications comes from a comparison of interval forecasts. Using a long span of annual data, there is more support for an <b>exponential</b> <b>smooth</b> transition autoregressive model over a linear autoregressive model for the U. K. -U. S. real exchange rate. Overall, our results suggest that any nonlinearities in monthly real exchange rate data from the post-Bretton Woods period are quite “subtle” for band-threshold and <b>exponential</b> <b>smooth</b> transition autoregressive model specifications. Further evidence of this is provided by in-sample comparisons of the conditional densities implied by nonlinea...|$|R
40|$|Linear {{predictability}} {{of stock}} market returns {{has been widely}} reported. However, recently developed theoretical {{research has suggested that}} due to the interaction of noise and arbitrage traders, stock returns are inherently non-linear, whereby market dynamics differ between small and large returns. This paper examines whether an <b>exponential</b> <b>smooth</b> transition threshold model, which is capable of capturing this non-linear behaviour, can provide a better characterization of UK stock market returns than either a linear model or an alternate non-linear model. The results of both in-sample and out-of-sample specification tests support the <b>exponential</b> <b>smooth</b> transition threshold model and hence the belief that investor behaviour does differ between large and small returns...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the tests}} of Kapetanios, Shin, and Snell (2003) and Bec, Ben Salem, and Carrasco (2004), which are {{designed}} to detect nonstationarity verses globally stationary <b>exponential</b> <b>smooth</b> transition autoregressive (ESTAR) nonlinearity, are extended {{to allow for a}} delay parameter, d, that is greater than one. Based on Monte Carlo simulations, it is shown that when the true delay parameter is greater than one, using the test with the correct value of d improves power almost uniformly compared to constraining the delay parameter to be unity. Using the tests when the delay parameter is not known and must be estimated is also addressed. <b>Exponential</b> <b>smooth</b> transition model, Unit roots, Monte Carlo simulations...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we re-examine {{a number}} of {{nonlinear}} models of U. S. dollar real exchange rate behavior from the extant empirical literature. Our re-examination employs econometric tests that go beyond the current “standard ” analysis of nonlinear models, including parametric encompassing tests of sample moments, graphical analysis of conditional expectation functions, model selection based on out-of-sample forecasting performance, and “flexible ” parametric nonlinearity tests. Using these econometric tests and data from the post-Bretton Woods float, we find little statistical evidence to recommend either band-threshold autoregressive models or <b>exponential</b> <b>smooth</b> transition autoregressive models over simple linear autoregressive models. Using data spanning more than two centuries, we find more statistical support for an <b>exponential</b> <b>smooth</b> transition autoregressive model for the U. K. -U. S. real exchange rate. Finally, there is some statistical backing for some Markov-switching autoregressive models estimated using post-Bretton Woods data.
